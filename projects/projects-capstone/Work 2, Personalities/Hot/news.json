First off - this is a limiting statement to only pit bulls.

And if your pit bull displays human aggression out of nowhere - especially when you've trained it, and it is a part of your pack/you're a part of it's pack; this speaks more to me that your emotional state around them is a confirmation bias that you are already expecting them to be aggressive at some point......just that 1% of the time.

I use many of them in support of pitbulls all the time. The link about their temperament is something I use often. But human aggression is something that is often talked about how it was bread out of pits. Just like you can breed a high prey drive, you can breed a drive to fight, just like you can breed a drive to retrieve. \n\nAlso, I've never had any issues with aggression with any of my dogs. I've had many of them over the years and it's not been a problem. That being said, not every dog will always be born with a perfect temperament and it might be necessary to destroy the animal. If the animal is getting loud/aggressive, maybe training can do. But if your dog, pit or not, legitimately just attacks someone and mauls them, that dog should be destroyed.

It has to do with the fact that most people do not understand their dog or its body language. Most of the time the dog doesn't just \"snap\". It was already exhibiting signs and giving off cues that it was going to, for example, bite. Most people that are legitimately surprised when their dog snaps and bites someone, are surprised because they didn't know that the signs were already there. \n\nOverall, I agree with what you are saying. I am a huge pitbull person. I defend pitbulls every chance I get. I just don't think there is room in this breed for people to do nothing about dogs exhibiting signs of an aggressive nature.

First there was Russian in several of his released documents, including error messages, suggesting the \"Romanian\" hacker was using Russian language settings on his computer. Also in an interview with vice, guccifer 2.0 was unable to speak Romanian without heavy mistakes. In the same interview, he claimed he hated being attributed as Russia (I don't doubt that) and that he didn't speak Russian. Less convincingly, but still part of the picture, Later in a blog post, he used ) as a smiley face, which is done by people using a Cyrillic keyboard to avoid shift + 6 for a :. In addition, fancy bear, the attacker thought to be the GRU (Russia's military intelligence) did nothing on April 15th, a national holiday for Russian electronic warfare servicemen.  There is certainly a reason everyone except trump and far right biased news. immediately thinks this was Russia when looking at the hack. \n\n\n\nAlso note that the two attackers on DNC network didn't know the other was there. This would be unusual for almost any state actor except Russia, whose intelligence agencies have been known to be very adversarial, going so far as to steal sources from one another to please the kremlin. \n\n\nFor more technical information, you can read the crowdstrike report. Note that US government, and multiple independent security firms attributed the attack to Russia. It is not normal for even what's in the crowdstrike report to be public, but the dnc wanted to go public with findings for transparency.\n\nFor more information on Russia's intelligence community, you can read the ECFR report: Putin's hydra, inside Russia's intelligence services. \n\n\nNot all evidence is public, but hopefully I gave you a decent rundown of what we have.

The pipeline route was chosen because it minimizes water crossings. The route was modified many times to find the most environmentally friendly route.\n\n-The majority of the oil that will be filling the line would have been shipped by rail. Rail is not as safe, it is more expensive, runs through high population areas, and on a per bbl basis, pollutes much more than rail.\n\n-The pipeline did not offer Standing Rock payment at any time, both parties have confirmed this. Energy Transfer has offered a number of community services for the Standing Rock area however.\n\n-The pipeline will be the safest line ever built. For instance, the portion under the river/lake will be up to 90 feet below the bottom of the water and will never come in contact with water. The pipe under the river will be heavy duty (double wall I think, don't quote me). Leak detection systems have a variety of methods of sensing leaks, but most use a mix of pressure waves or pressure readings sent to a control center via transmitters on either side of the river. Any alarm would immediately cause the block valves on either side of the river to shut and close off any flow.\n\n-The Sanding Rock Water Supply will not be impacted by the pipeline should it leak.

This is their land, first and foremost- its not on them to chase pipeline representatives around to continually be told that their opinion is irrelevant. The tribe said no, meaning no, they don't want another pipeline built on their land. People counter this by suggesting that the treaties they signed were somehow nullified, which is balderdash.\n\nArticle XII from the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie:\n\n> NO TREATY FOR THE CESSION OF ANY PORTION OR PART OF THE RESERVATION HEREIN DESCRIBED WHICH MAY BE HELD IN COMMON SHALL BE OF ANY VALIDITY OR FORCE as against the said Indians, UNLESS EXECUTED AND SIGNED BY AT LEAST THREE-FOURTHS OF ALL THE ADULT MALE INDIANS, occupying or interested in the same; and no cession by the tribe shall be understood or construed in such manner as to deprive, without his consent, any individual member of the tribe of his rights to any tract land selected by him, as provided in article 6 of this treaty.\nhttp://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/nt001.asp\n\nThe ruling from United States v. Sioux Nation (1980) found the following:\n\n> Subsequently, in 1876, an \"agreement\" presented to the Sioux by a special Commission but SIGNED BY ONLY 10% OF THE ADULT MALE SIOUX POPULATION, provided that the Sioux would relinquish their rights to the Black Hills and to hunt in the unceded territories, in exchange for subsistence rations for as long as they would be needed.\nhttps://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/448/371/ \n\nThis was a violation of the treaty itself, but even the compensation the Sioux were due for the taking of their lands was ruled to not have been a fair compensation, meaning they violated the 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The court case footnotes includes a mention from the Indian Claims Commission:\n\n> (Footnote 33) First, it noted that \"[a]lthough couched in general terms, this amendment is directed to one basic objective - expediting the Indian Claims Commission's disposition of the famous Black Hills case.\" S. Rep. No. 93-863, p. 2 (1974) (incorporating memorandum prepared by the Sioux Tribes). SECOND, THE COMMITTEE OBSERVED: \"THE FACTS ARE, AS THE COMMISSION FOUND, THAT THE UNITED STATES DISARMED THE SIOUX AND DENIED THEM THEIR TRADITIONAL HUNTING AREAS IN AN EFFORT TO FORCE THE SALE OF THE BLACK HILLS. HAVING VIOLATED THE 1868 TREATY and having reduced the Indians to starvation, the United States should not now be in the position of saying that the rations it furnished constituted payment for the land which it took.\n\nIn fact, the whole premise was a deceptive plot in order to get the Sioux to sell in the first place. The court notes that illegal actions were committed even before the Agreement of 1877, the deal that the 1980 Supreme Court case deals with. Note the following:\n\n> IN THE WINTER OF 1875-1876, many of the SIOUX WERE HUNTING IN THE UNCEDED TERRITORY north of the North Platte River, reserved to them for that purpose in the Fort Laramie Treaty. On December 6, 1875, for reasons that are not entirely clear, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs sent instructions to the Indian agents on the reservation to notify those hunters that if they did not return to the reservation agencies by January 31, 1876, they would be treated as \"hostiles.\" Given the severity of the winter, compliance with these instructions was impossible. ON FEBRUARY 1, THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR NONETHELESS RELINQUISHED JURISDICTION OVER ALL HOSTILE SIOUX, INCLUDING THOSE INDIANS EXERCISING THEIR TREATY-PROTECTED HUNTING RIGHTS, TO THE WAR DEPARTMENT.\nhttp://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/448/371.html \n\nThe Sioux have maintained the land was illegally taken. As a party to the treaty, there is no legal justification for why they wouldn\u2019t have a say in the treaty:\n\n> One key problem: The tribes say the payment is invalid because the land was never for sale and accepting the funds would be tantamount to a sales transaction. Ross Swimmer, former special trustee for American Indians, said the trust fund remains untouched for one reason: \u201cThey didn\u2019t want the money. They wanted the Black Hills.\u201d\n>\u201cThe Sioux tribes have always maintained that that confiscation was illegal and the tribes must have some of their ancestral lands returned to them, and they\u2019ve maintained that position since 1877,\u201d said Mario Gonzalez, general counsel for the Oglala Sioux Tribe, who has devoted much of his career to the issue.\nhttp://www.pbs.org/.../north_america-july-dec11.../ \n\nThe opinion of the United States Court of Claims also reaffirms this:\n\n> More than 100 years later, in 1979, the United States Court of Claims, discussing the federal government\u2019s misdeeds against the Sioux, including its tactic of starving them, before it appropriated the land, wrote that \u201ca more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealing will never, in all probability, be found in our history.\u201d\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/.../sioux-race-to-find-millions-to... \n\nThe Sioux sued to recover the land after the 1980 SCOTUS decision which effectively ruled the taking as illegal, and they decided what compensation they wanted to pay. The Sioux, as a nation, has a right to disagree with the compensation they offered and refuse it, which is what they have done. The compensation has accrued interest over the years and is now worth $1.3 Billion dollars. No matter what your opinion on the topic, or mine, there is no legal obligation to accept this money and the Supreme Court has ruled that this is, in fact, their land, and that it was stolen.", "id": "dap9h64"}, {"comment": ">\"They didn\u2019t want the money.

Oil companies routinely make exaggerated claims about how safe their pipelines are. The equally modern Keystone XL pipeline touted it's use of tens of thousands of sensors to detect leaks, claimed it was safer than required by law, said it could detect and shut down any issue within 10 minutes. However, in reality those sensors only detect leaks 5% of the time and it's industry standard that they are incapable of detecting leaks below 1% of flow, which in the case of the Dakota Access Pipeline could be up to 200,000 gallons of oil a day. When Keystone XL did in fact leak, it spilled 17,000 gallons without the company detecting that there was in fact a leak.

Parents this year will be less hard put to it to explain why one Santa Clause differs from another for one type is in demand. Height, weight, stature are almost as exactly standardized as are the red garments, the hood, the white whiskers, and the pack full of toys.  Ruddy cheeks and nose, bushy white eyebrows and a jolly paunchy effect are also inevitable parts of the requisite make-up.\n\n>One additional artist would help complete the standardization.  Haddon Sundblom.  His best-known art was created for an additional client, Coca-Cola...\n\n>...This advertising initiative made sense: if an association of Coca-Cola with Santa Claus could boost winter seasonal sales, the company would be that much more successful. Also, building an association with a red and white Santa was ideal for a soft drink whose emblematic colors were, come to think ofit, red and white.\n\nSnopes is correct to say that Coca-Cola did not create Santa Claus, but the Coca-Cola advertising campaigns of Haddon Sundblom standardized the appearance of the American Santa Claus.  Our idea of what Santa Claus should look like comes from Coca Cola.  While Sundblom did not invent the character he chose, he did choose among many variations that still existed at the time.  None of these exist now due to Coca-Cola.\n\nKeep in mind that snopes is not written by historians.", "id": "dapcnnj"}, {"comment": "I'm guessing you didn't read the article, it MOSTLY agrees with you, but to say these things were not already standardized before the Coca-Cola ad campaign is misleading.

I explained to you the fallacy in your argument, did someone delete their comments and hide in their safe space when they were proven wrong?\n\n&nbsp; \n\nAnyway here's my response to the last comment you deleted: \"People don't think correctly\". Man you are trying everything to dance around the evidence planting, and I am well aware of the psychology and effects of life and death split second reactions and situations. I also know that in any situation you want to maintain mental control. Your entire 1st part of this is pointless \"feel bad for the cop, it was stressful\" rhetoric.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNo one is contesting that Walter Scott was wrong to wrestle and run. And the taser was smacked from the officers hand, as evident in the video, which oddly enough is contrary to the officers testimony and the prosecutor explained that perfectly. However, this doesn't change the fact that Walter Scott was shot 6 times in the back while fleeing. Shooting a man fleeing you is not self defense. So no, at some point the taser wasn't kicked or dragged, at a sepcific moment walter scott smacked it from the officers hand and ran. Watch the video and stop distorting facts, its moronic. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSlager didn't think Scott took it, and had no reason to because again, it was smacked from slagers hand. Slager chose to fire and kill Scott as Scott ran. If Slager thought he took the taser, he was wrong. Your defense is false again. He didn't reasonably think he took it, and even if he did and I can't stress this enough, it doesn't justify making the cognitive decision to shoot Scott in the back as he flees. Reasonably matter under the law, and shooting a fleeing man in the back isn't reasonable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis thread may show some ignorance for the law, but you contribute to it. And again, your argument is riddled with fallacy that I highlighted above. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's amusing you didn't highlight my last paragraph in my previous response, identifying the total collapse of your counter to the planting evidence argument.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd as a veteran, explain to me why you are silent in matters of constitutional rights infringment. Specifically police use of stingray devices.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd heres an explanation again, as to why your argument about planting evidence is false. Try not and delete comments and cower like a punk this time. I know cognitive dissodence is strong with you bootlickers, but maybe you'll overcome. Here's that explanation, feel free to educate yourself: Your entire argument is laughable. \"He had to secure it that's why he ran to grab it, but, he still dropped it next to the victim because it was \"so important to secure the taser ;) \", than he waited until the 2nd officer saw it, and pointed it out, acknowledging that the taser was next to walter scott, but no, the 1st officer totally didn't drop the taser next to walter scott and wait till a witness (2nd officer) saw it to pick it up to back up his \"walter scott stole my taser\" story. You all just hate cops and america\". Come on man. Let's talk about the original police report that is riddled with lies while we're at it, and the \"damn liberal media\" that basically convicted walter scott and just parroted the false claims of the officer, in the few days between this event and the bystanders releasing his personal video.

They are comparable: if you can't censor a book because someone might use the information irresponsibly, why support gun licensing and the like because someone might use it irresponsibly?\n\nIf you like the other form of it which is that guns do kill people because people use them irresponsibly, then you can also say people use the printing press irresponsibly, which is what those who seek to ban hate speech argue: that indeed, the printed word by itself can somehow terrorize a whole community.\n\nPick whichever you like better.\n\n> If you think that no constitutional right is ever subject to any restriction under any circumstances (which assumes that the unrestricted contours of the right are obvious to begin with), I don't think that makes sense, but your disagreement isn't with me, it's with every constitutional decision rendered since the founding.

And certainly not yours.  I am not really arguing at all.\n\nI'm explaining my position, and if I didn't make it clear, try to license my guns, I'm going to ignore that.\n\nCome and take them, I'm going to shoot.\n\nThat's not an argument, but a statement of intent.\n\nIt is one shared by quite a few gun owners.\n\nWhen people who have problems with guns attempt to engage with gun owners, they really come with a complete misunderstanding of the purpose and intent of gun ownership to begin with:\n\nWhether an individual, political faction, or mob confronts us, we intend to *assert* those rights - not argue for them or plead for them or compromise in an effort to have government recognize them.\n\nThe Supreme Court doesn't even exist as a constitutional entity (it's nowhere in there.)  Its function, as far as I am concerned, is to prevent things coming to a head, which it has done fairly well since the nation's founding.  But it is sort of like a security fence.  I'm all for that fence keeping people out of my life and I prefer it to having to shoot.  I am all for lawsuits and constitutional cases which prevent actual armed confrontation, which I do not want, and do not court.\n\nBut if that fence is breached, I will, indeed, shoot.\n\nIf that shocks or bothers you or, more likely, strikes you as Internet tough guy bloviation (can't blame you), any of those are fine with me.  Believe whatever you like.\n\nBut if indeed people who say they are appalled by violence really seek to reduce or abolish violence from human affairs, they need to understand exactly what attempts to corral or somehow force gun owners into submission will entail.  And further, they need to understand that their soft-fingered chair-warming asses won't be the ones coming to enforce that submission: it will, in fact, be guys with guns (and uniforms) who will shoot us, if necessary, for refusing to surrender our arms -- the ultimate irony.\n\nAs a fan of not ever having to shoot anyone or anything, I am happy for that there fence - those governmental institutions which protect our rights.  The lawsuits and legislative battles which prevent gun control advocates for having their way.\n\nBut I am quite prepared for that fence to be breached.\n\nIf you seek to argue with gun advocates, like you have your say, and we point out bad premises or internal contradictions in your arguments, then you do the same with ours, and we eventually arrive at some sort of compromise or understanding, you really don't grasp exactly what is being argued, nor who you are arguing with.\n\nAt this point, ordinarily in any discussion, my never-arrested, ethical vegan, non-violent self is called a nut or extremist or something else.  That, too, is fine.  The ultimate irony, of course, it is that it is advocates of gun control, of which licensing and registration are prime examples, who seem to want to push this \"discussion\" to a violent confrontation.  All we want is to be left alone with our arms.  That's it.\n\nAnd it is funny how often we're taken to task for this: on one hand, people express to the point of paranoia, fear about our guns, or the way we think or whatever, and then in the next breath we get sarcastic comments about how we don't rise up in an armed manner to support leftish causes.  It's schizophrenic in the extreme.  I'm not saying you're one of these people, but you'd really find it interesting climbing into my head and hearing it from my side, knowing who I am and how I live my life.  And hearing from people what they think my motivations are, or what sort of person I am.\n\nBut this is not like an argument about whether we build a road here or there, or what will the town hall look like, or shall we have a 6 percent or 7 percent municipal tax.\n\nThis is an argument about exactly how far you believe government ought to be able to intrude into our homes, and by extension, into our right to defend ourselves against individuals, mobs, or the state. \n\nThe answer to any proposed licensing or registration schemes is no. \n\nI cannot blame someone for being confused about this when a pro-gunner of my particular disposition enters into a discussion with you, as if I am here to test the internal consistency of my opinions, or am open to having my mind changed by the same pre-cooked set of arguments I've heared repeatedly for the 32 years I've been following this issue (there really are no new arguments on either side.)

My point is less about whether it will happen or not, clearly there is no will to drive real reforms when after everything we've been through we still don't have PDs responsible & accountable for reporting how many ~~civilians~~people they kill...  so I get that (1) unlikely for change to happen unless things get worse and (2) likely that any change close to what I describe would have be forced on law enforcement rather than the system evolving that way.\n\nAs for unions, (2) above is why that is critical.  Unions aren't needed for individuals to have representation, and frankly I don't see why LEOs can't have something closer to a professional association versus a union.  Professional associations aren't focused protecting the *bad apples* in the group, they are about protecting the *good apples* through standards and integrity of their members.  \n\nAs for much of my other suggestions, while some of those functions exist today, there is completely inadequate independence & accountability.  The most recent glaring example of that was in Chicago where the clear murder by a cop was covered up by officers on the scene, by officers investigating, by the \"independent\" review board, by the city's legal team fighting FOIAs, etc, etc. And even after it all comes to light, only the shooter is charged.\n\nPersonally I think there should be national entity set up that (i) sets national standards on training, conduct policies, dispute resolution rules, etc., (ii) oversees investigations of misconduct & every officer-involved homicide, (iii) prosecutes any LEO-involved case & (iv) centralizes transparency/accountability (power to compel release of information, subpoena power for investigations in general, whistle-blower protections, etc.).  Ideally you would have a robust set of federal laws regarding LEO conduct, which would bring jurisdiction for prosecution under DoJ and could allow enforcement to brought under a DoJ/DHS agency like the Secret Service b/c their main mandate is less dependent on cooperation with local or state PDs (unlike FBI or ATF for example).  That would likely need to happen with state consent given division of powers, but I'm not an expert there, although can compel state standards if federal funding for security matters is expressly tied to adopting some recommended federal standard.  Independent entities like the ACLU and NAACP should have formal involvement, as well as bar associations on a state level.\n\nAs far as a national registry, reporting would be required for complaints & disciplinary actions, and would ensure that info is available (i) to other PDs when hiring (importantly not just so they have the info, but take away an excuse that they didn't know the history) and (ii) for appropriate record keeping in case of criminal or civil actions when records can be subpoenaed reliably.  Obviously there are examples (eg, Chicago) where they have tried to delete files by saying it is a CBA requirement... \n\nBody cams are a solve-able problem.  From what I've read the results are impressive and in the interests of everyone (fewer complaints, fewer use of force), but equally obvious are that many places cops/unions are being blatantly obstructionist to trialing/implementing (NYPD/BPD).  If we had a federal agency providing national oversight, practices & investment could be made effectively.  Importantly, certainly cameras aren't flawless but a great way to enforce it is to have a burden shift occur with respect to testimony when a camera isn't on...\n\n> A lot of the money goes to the court systens and state.\n\nThis isn't enough.  Local authorities, PDs and the justice system more broadly should have **zero** direct financial incentive to set & enforce laws.  Ideally would be federal general revenue as being the most remote, but failing that should be state general revenue (not funding state PD, not funding state courts).  The DoJ report on Ferguson makes this need all too clear.\n\nApologies for being a turd earlier, but I am under no illusions about how difficult it would be to implement any of this... that said, drastic change is warranted.\n\nedit: doh, civilians is the wrong way to say people", "id": "dapb9mq"}, {"comment": "When it comes to unions, their main job is protecting individual officers. I don't really blame cops for liking that.

I couldnt trust ACLU or NAACP to not fuck it up.\n\nA registry would be fine.\n\nAs for cameras, NYPD refused because of manufacturer choice, and BPD refused since they felt like the officers under the trial would be unfairly targeted by superiors. I understand both of these, and agree with BPD that it should be all cops wearing them at once.\n\nAlso, the money issue with cams still stands.\n\nCivil forfeiture needs to be handled in the courts.\n\nThe stuff you said isnt even that drastic really.", "id": "dappo8k"}, {"comment": "You can't have agencies that work closely with local law enforcement be the ones investigating LEOs.

Huge conflict of interest if investigators are not fully arms-length.  \n\nI'm not saying ACLU or NAACP lead investigations, but they are involved to provide transparency (or whatever third-party organization is appropriate). \n\n> Civil forfeiture needs to be handled in the courts.\n\nThe process of it, absolutely.  But not who benefits from the proceeds.  Enforcing law shouldn't be viewed as a revenue generating (or cost offsetting) activity.  Something made abundantly clear in the Ferguson DoJ report... as well as countless other anecdotes.  Similar point on private enterprise running jails, or the whole bail/probation racket that exists.\n\n> The stuff you said isnt even that drastic really.\n\nIMHO it is.  none of it exists today in any manner that actually provides accountability & transparency.

This created economic incentive to relocate factories to smaller towns, where land/wages were less expensive and they saved even more by building wider one/two story buildings instead of building upwards. So, towns took factory jobs away from cities because it was more profitable to be located there at that time. Since then, global transport and information transport technology has improved, and factories have relocated again to the areas of greatest return (cheapest land/labor/regulation costs).

Turntablist techniques developed along with the breaks and the Jamaican toasting vocal style was used. Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks along with an instrumental or synthesized beat. Notable artists at this time include DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five, Fab Five Freddy, Marley Marl, Afrika Bambaataa, Kool Moe Dee, Kurtis Blow, Doug E. Fresh, Whodini, Warp 9, The Fat Boys, and Spoonie Gee. The Sugarhill Gang's 1979 song \"Rapper's Delight\" is widely regarded to be the first hip hop record to gain widespread popularity in the mainstream.[15] The 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles.[16] Prior to the 1980s, hip hop music was largely confined within the United States. However, during the 1980s, it began its spread and became a part of the music scene in dozens of countries.\n\nNew school hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music, originating in 1983\u201384 with the early records of Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J. The Golden age hip hop period was an innovative period between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s. Notable artists from this era include the Juice Crew, Public Enemy, Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions and KRS-One, EPMD, Slick Rick, Beastie Boys, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Ultramagnetic MCs, De La Soul, and A Tribe Called Quest.\n\nGangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that often focuses on the violent lifestyles and impoverished conditions of inner-city youths. Schoolly D, N.W.A, Ice-T, Ice Cube, and the Geto Boys are artists most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap. These artists were known for mixing the political and social commentary of political rap with the criminal elements and crime stories found in gangsta rap.[17]\n\nIn the West Coast hip hop style, G-funk dominated mainstream hip hop for several years during the 1990s. East Coast hip hop in the early to mid 1990s was dominated by the Afrocentric jazz rap and alternative hip hop of the Native Tongues posse as well as the hardcore rap of artists such as Nas, Wu-Tang Clan, and Notorious B.I.G..\n\nIn the 1990s, hip hop began to diversify with other regional styles emerging on the national scene, such as Southern rap and Atlanta hip hop. At the same time, hip hop continued to be assimilated into other genres of popular music, an example being Neo soul. Hip hop became a best-selling music genre in the mid-1990s and the top selling music genre by 1999. The popularity of hip hop music continued through the 2000s, with hip hop influences also increasingly finding their way into mainstream pop. The United States also saw the success of styles such as crunk, a music that emphasized the beats and music more than the lyrics. Starting in 2005, sales of hip hop music in the United States began to severely wane. During the mid-2000s that alternative hip hop secured a place within the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of artists such as OutKast and Kanye West.[18]\n\nContents  [hide] \n1\tOrigin of the term\n2\t1970s\n2.1\tOrigins\n2.2\tIntroduction of rapping\n2.3\tInfluence of disco\n2.4\tTransition to recording\n3\t1980s\n3.1\tNew school hip hop\n3.2\tGolden age hip hop\n3.3\tGangsta rap and West Coast hip hop\n4\t1990s\n4.1\tMainstream breakthrough\n4.2\tWorld hip hop\n4.3\tEast vs. West rivalry\n4.3.1\tWest Coast hip hop\n4.3.2\tEast Coast hip hop\n4.4\tDiversification of styles\n5\t2000s and 2010s\n5.1\tWorld and national music\n5.2\tCrunk and snap music\n5.3\tGlitch hop and wonky music\n5.4\tDecline in sales\n5.5\tInnovation and revitalization\n6\tRap linguistics\n7\tSee also\n8\tNotes\n9\tReferences\n10\tExternal links\nOrigin of the term\nCreation of the term hip hop is often credited to Keith Cowboy, rapper with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.[19] However, Lovebug Starski, Keith Cowboy, and DJ Hollywood used the term when the music was still known as disco rap.[20] It is believed that Cowboy created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined the U.S. Army, by scat singing the words \"hip/hop/hip/hop\" in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of soldiers marching.[19] Cowboy later worked the \"hip hop\" cadence into a part of his stage performance, which was quickly used by other artists such as The Sugarhill Gang in \"Rapper's Delight\".[19]\n\nUniversal Zulu Nation founder Afrika Bambaataa is credited with first using the term to describe the subculture in which the music belonged; although it is also suggested that it was a derogatory term to describe the type of music.[21] The first use of the term in print was in The Village Voice,[22] by Steven Hager, later author of a 1984 history of hip hop.[23]\n\n1970s\nOrigins\n\n1520 Sedgwick Avenue, the Bronx, a venue used by Kool Herc that is often considered the birthplace of hip hop in 1973[24]\n\nDJ Kool Herc, recognized as one of the earliest hip hop artists\nHip hop as music and culture formed during the 1970s when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among African-American youth residing in the Bronx.[14] Block parties incorporated DJs, who played popular genres of music, especially funk and soul music. Due to the positive reception, DJs began isolating the percussive breaks of popular songs. This technique was then common in Jamaican dub music,[25] and was largely introduced into New York by immigrants from Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean, including DJ Kool Herc, who has been called a \"founding father of hip hop\".[26][27] Because the percussive breaks in funk, soul and disco records were generally short, Herc and other DJs began using two turntables to extend the breaks.\n\nHip hop's early evolution into a form distinct from R&B also, not coincidentally, occurred around the time that sampling technology and drum-machines became widely available to the general public at a cost that was affordable to the average consumer\u2014not just professional studios. Drum-machines and samplers were combined in machines that came to be known as MPC's or 'Music Production Centers', early examples of which would include the Linn 9000. The first sampler that was broadly adopted to create this new kind of music was the Mellotron used in combination with the TR-808 drum machine. Mellotrons and Linn's were succeeded by the AKAI, in the late 1980s.[28]\n\nTurntablist techniques \u2013 such as scratching (attributed to Grand Wizzard Theodore[29][30]), beat mixing and/or matching, and beat juggling \u2013 eventually developed along with the breaks, creating a base that could be rapped over, in a manner similar to signifying, as well as the art of toasting, another influence found in Jamaican dub music.[25][31]\n\nBoxer Muhammad Ali influenced several elements of hip hop music, as a \"rhyming trickster\" in the 1960s with \"funky delivery, the boasts, the comical trash talk, the endless quotables\".[32] According to Rolling Stone, his \"freestyle skills\" and his \"rhymes, flow, and braggadocio\" would \"one day become typical of old school MCs\" like Run\u2013D.M.C. and LL Cool J,[33] the latter citing Ali as an influence.[32]\n\nHip hop music in its infancy has been described as an outlet and a \"voice\" for the disenfranchised youth of low-economic areas,[34] as the culture reflected the social, economic and political realities of their lives.[35]\n\nIntroduction of rapping\nRapping, also referred to as MCing or emceeing, is a vocal style in which the artist speaks lyrically, in rhyme and verse, generally to an instrumental or synthesized beat. Beats, almost always in 4/4 time signature, can be created by sampling and/or sequencing portions of other songs by a producer.[36] They also incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands. Rappers may write, memorize, or improvise their lyrics and perform their works a cappella or to a beat.\n\nHip hop music predates the introduction of rapping into hip hop culture, and rap vocals are absent from many hip hop tracks, such as \"Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don't Stop)\" by Man Parrish; \"Chinese Arithmetic\" by Eric B. & Rakim; \"Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)\" and \"We're Rocking the Planet\" by Hashim; and \"Destination Earth\" by Newcleus. However, the majority of the genre has been accompanied by rap vocals, such as the Sci-fi influenced electro hip hop group Warp 9.[37] Female rappers appeared on the scene in the late 1970s and early 80s, including Bronx artist MC Sha Rock, member of the Funky Four Plus One, credited with being the first female MC [38] and The Sequence, a hip hop trio signed to Sugar Hill Records, the first all female group to release a rap record, Funk You Up.\n\nThe roots of rapping are found in African-American music and ultimately African music", "id": "daoca7t"}, {"comment": "How can someone so ignorant on a whole genre of music get upvoted like this?

Unikn Street has become known as a mecca for self-abusive people like me seeking a perfect place to get away, pay a fortune, and suffer abuse both verbally and physically. \n\nI knew I was in for a (mis)treat(ment) when I first arrived. Instead of finding convenient parking, i circled the potholed and poorly lit lot until settling for a spot on the street a few blocks away. First impressions can be deceiving, so I didn't let this get my hopes up. But prospects only got better (worse) after i shlepped my luggage back over to the lobby. I was greeted at the door by the the foulest smelling dog turd I have had the pleasure to step in since my stay at the El Paso Motel 6 (which I also highly recommend). One of the owner's adorably odious dogs had deposited the feces ON the threshold, in an ingenious location, so that the action of the door smeared the dog's noxious refuse across the taupe doormat, making an unavoidable obstacle of odor.\n\nAt the front desk, the manager demonstrated that he was no less skilled than the dog in the art of misanthropy. He was engaged in a heated argument with a guest about the bill, so he waved me off, giving me the opportunity to admire the lobby's decor. Taxidermy animal heads, abstract art with thick paint brush smears (all for sale!), big vases filled with dessicated reeds, and small, wobbly tables to sit and sip burnt coffee. \n\nOnce the fracas with the other guest reached its bitter conclusion, I introduced myself to the manager: a short, monobrowed, igor of a man with a stained butler vest and permanent scowl. He promptly informed me that Union House had no record of my reservation. I showed him the email confirmation, which elicited an indignant huff of consternation.  He grudgingly inspected his ledger again and found my room had been rented to another couple. He informed me, with a note of feindish delight, that there was NO room for me, and that I would have to leave or else be defenestrated manually. Naturally I chose the latter option. \n\nI give the USGH a one star review because, after roiling me up in sick anticipation of a grueling three night confinement in service hell, I was sent away and forced to endure cloying hospitality at the insufferably pleasant Croff House a few blocks away. \n\nFortunately, USGH did keep all my money, as a consolation for failing to provide the gulagesque internment I had been guaranteed.

If your meal/experience isn't A1 excellent ask for a manager or at a nicer place the server ( no all servers are not equal). I judge places mostly on how well they respond to when things arent perfect because as said they wont always be. Maybe a steak got left on too long, (maybe it was just you).

If a server makes a mistake, or something seems off, or you need something -- no one has ANY chance to make ANYTHING better if you keep it to yourself. \n\nI've had customers stiff me because I forgot to bring lemon for their water or they wanted ketchup, never asked, and expected me to know. Why make yourself miserable and pay for a dissatisfactory meal because you have too much pride to ask for something a second time? I can predict that a customer will leave a very poor tip if they become non-communicative during the meal. If I ask them if everything is all right, or if they need anything, they will use curt replies. You KNOW that there is something wrong and you're desperate to fix it. This is an extremely unpleasant experience for everyone involved. Sometimes customers will only complain if a manager visits, or another server, or sometimes tell visiting managers that they are fine but wait for the server to come around to complain.\n\nIf you don't raise an issue, no one can make it right!!

Most boys don't finish puberty until around 17. It is objectively more of an abuse of mental and sexual naivety for a female teacher to rape a boy than a male teacher to rape a girl of the same age for the age range of students in middle and highschool. This is just a fact.\n\nSo the argument against mental trauma and fragility goes out the window unless its made for boys simultaneously when made for girls in this age range. This is the direct logical result of the above fact.\n\n> Everyone feels\n\nThat's just the problem here, just like the PC boogieman, you are basing your reality on your feelings instead of on the facts. Sexual fetishes and fantasies developed later in life can color one's perception of how they would have responded when they were younger and lead them to rationalize away what would be the objective psychiatric and psychological ramifications of such an experience had it occurred. Girls fantasize about their attractive male teachers just as much, if not more than, boys fantasize about their attractive female teachers. Teenage girl mental purity is a myth. They not only experience the flood of sexually stimulating hormones earlier in life, they have already been exposed to this for years by the time boys start experiencing it.\n\nIt is the duty of the educator not to fuck underage students. Period. I'm thinking its something cultural in America where teachers fucking young students has a whole subculture developed around it where there are certain ways of judging it ok and not ok. People come out with their opinions on specific cases like getting to fuck underage students is based on a point system.\n\nIn this instance the students were 18, so there should be no scandal at all except if the teacher used sex to manipulate or intimidate the student (such as through the threat of a false rape accusation or a pregnancy scare). The question to ask is, what is wrong with the teacher mentally that she can't attract and sexually interact with men her own age and status, or if she can, why did she take a serious social risk in this instance?", "id": "daqjbkt"}], [{"comment": "Why doesnt this shit ever happen to me?", "id": "daq0czu"}, {"comment": "Happened to me quite a bit.\n\nOne of the perks of being home-schooled I guess.", "id": "daq0oe8"}, {"comment": "I heard that can lead to a fractured education", "id": "daq0s1e"}, {"comment": "The story of homeschooling.

But if properly prescribed, they are not \"terrible\" or a guaranteed pill addiction.\n\nA few things we must clarify first:\n\n* psychological addiction - this can happen with anything pleasurable. People get addicted to food, alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling. You enjoy the pleasure and you do irrational / unsafe things to seek that pleasure. You have a compulsion driving you to do it even though you know it's bad for you. This is the person going into the casino with their paycheck instead of paying their rent. Because it's psychological, this can happen with marijuana. This definitely can happen with opiates - but is most common when someone is prescribed a dose higher than they actually need for pain relief and experience euphoria instead of just pain relief.\n* physical dependence - this happens when you use certain substances for a long time, and the body goes through withdrawals if you suddenly discontinue the substance. This is **NOT** the same thing as addiction, although many people addicted to substances will take enough of them to experience withdrawals. If you take heart medication (beta blockers) which have no euphoria whatsoever you will experience withdrawals if you suddenly stop taking them. This also happens with opiates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines but not marijuana.\n\nNow that we have that out of the way - we'll discuss pain.\n\nAt the highest level, there are two types of pain - \n\n1) nociceptive pain - this is \"regular\" pain that's caused by a physical injury. It's considered a \"normal\" response to damage to the body. \n\n2) neuropathic pain - this is pain that's \"abnormal\" and due to nerves being damaged or otherwise not functioning properly. \n\nThere are numerous biochemical processes around pain. There is \"substance P\" (and some medications inhibit this). There are also different nerve components that transmit pain. But the primary way pain is experienced, especially nociceptive pain, are through receptors called \"opioid receptors\". Triggering these receptors directly block pain. Unfortunately, these same receptors also can cause euphoria (paraphrasing here - research is ongoing with receptors besides the mu receptors but so far stipulating other receptors like the kappa receptor at best product analgesic response with dysphoria). \n\nProperly dosed, opiates will stimulate the receptors sufficiently to cause pain relief with minimal to no euphoria. However, due to many factors including the subjective nature of pain, this doesn't always happen. When people take a high enough dose of opiates to experience euphoria, this creates the potential for psychological addiction. \n\nA person will not become physically dependent on opiates until they take them for a long period of time (weeks to months). \n\nThe key for successful therapeutic use is to use the lowest dose required to provide analgesia for the shortest period of time. When long term use is called for, additional considerations are required to manage dependence. \n\nSubstances like marijuana do not show any significant modulation on the opioid receptors, and only show minimal substance P inhibition. As such, it doesn't seem to help relieve pain much in cases of acute injury. Instead, it seems help in two ways:\n\n1) get the person high, so they're distracted or don't care about their pain.

Where did the fire start? Do you know what caused it? How did you get out? Was there o my one exit? ", "id": "daqv7io"}, {"comment": "There was only one exit. I was on the top floor when the fire started, so I don't know how it got started. I distinctly remember thinking that this probably wasn't a big deal and/or that it was maybe a prank. \n\n\nAfter the fire started I walked to the top of the stairs where there was only  enough room for one maybe two people to go down at a time. At this point I still didn't think it was a big deal. It wasn't until a girl ahead of me came  back up the stairs and yelled that \"it's too thick everyone back up to the top.\" (This may not be exactly what she said but I'm this whole period is kind of a blur it's the gist of it however)\n\n\nThat was when I realized that this was very serious and that I was in big trouble. At this point I realized that my best shot at survival was to find my way down the stairs and and try and find the exit. My decision to go down was a coin flip at that point because I was terrified. The kind of fear I felt was not the kind of fear I have ever felt towards anything in my entire life. This was a primal sort of fear. I very much didn't care about other people making it out as long as I did at this point. Luckily I don't think I smashed into anybody or hit them on my way out. I completely lost track of my two friends during this time period to give an example of how one track minded I was. I feel really bad that I didn't care and I feel like I should have said something to all those people before I jumped down. Maybe give them a fighting chance if they realized that down was the only potential option for survival.  \n\n\nBear in mind that the time it took for me to first see smoke and reach the top of the stairs before things got really bad was only like a minute. \n\n\nSo once I slipped and slid down the stairs keep in mind that these were the worst crafted stairs ever. (The first bit was like a ramp almost. And then the steps had varying heights sometimes almost coming up to thigh level. I'm 5'9 so while I'm not super tall that's enough for some of the steps to be way too tall for stairs.) \n\n\nOnce I made it down the stairs I tried to crawl to where I knew the exit was. I had a good general idea of its distance from me but I would have to find two doors and to try and get out. Even though I had an idea of where I was because of coming down the stairs the way I stumbled down basically made it so it's very likely that I wouldn't find an exit. \n\n\nOnce I was down there it was awful. I couldn't see or breathe. It was hot smoky and hard to focus. Thankfully at this point it wasn't so hot that I was burning just being there. There were other people crawling around on the floor too. \n\n\nSo I was down there and I was having trouble finding the exit. At this point I genuinely thought I was going to die choking on smoke in these horrid conditions. Part of this was definitely because the lower level is like a fucking maze. The stair room had three different exits and only one would have been the way to outside.\n\nSo I had only been down on the floor for 15ish seconds. (Even though it genuinely felt like I was down there for eternity.) As I was down there blindly trying to find the door to get out I got really lucky. Some dude who had already gotten out stood right by the exit with all the billowing smoke and was repeatedly yelling \"this is the exit\" \"exit.\" I can say without a doubt that that dude saved my life. If he wasn't there yelling I would have never found the exit and I probably would have died. \n\nOnce I got outside I ran into one of my friends who had been inside. He had been behind me to go down the stairs and had somehow gotten out in front of me. I was so happy that at least we had made it out. \n\nThe outside looked to me like a fucking warzone. People were covered in soot and crying and hugging each other and screaming. Lots of people were calling out their friends names in an effort to find them. I just kind of stood and there and stared hoping that my other friend had made it out and that everyone would make it out safe.\n\n\nOnce I got out, only two more people made it out after I did. \n\n\nIn around five minutes or so the fire department showed up. by the time they reached the scene the entire building was in flames. For a thirty or so minute period I stood there waiting for the them to try and get people out in the vain hope that my other friend had made it out and that they would be able to get everyone out.\n\nDuring this time period it really looked like the fire was starting to go down. And there was a chance of saving more lives. Unfortunately everyone's hopes were crushed when in the space of one second the fire got like three times worse. It started coming out the windows and the roof caught fire. I waited there for close to three or four hours hoping that we could get some information about our friend. I still don't know what happened to him or if he's even okay.\n\nAlso I should note that the building went up so fast. I'd have to say it was probably 3/4s on fire in under 3 minutes.\n\n\nI'm really tired and the night is very blurry, plus i'm typing this on my phone so if there are any spelling/ grammar errors and the story isn't very coherent I apologize. I might have messed up some of the details as well. It's also very hard for me to talk about this but I still decided to because I think that my memory of the night is only going to get worse from here.   \n\nEdit: I just want to say that everyone has been incredibly supportive and nice and I really appreciate it.  \n\nEdit 2: Whoever gave me gold I appreciate it but I would rather rif you have extra money that you do not give me gold and instead donate it here. \n\nhttps://www.youcaring.com/firevictimsofoaklandfiredec232016-706684?fb_action_ids=10154858073477755&fb_action_types=youcaringcom%3Ashare", "id": "daqxs0k"}, {"comment": "> Some dude who had already gotten out stood right by the exit with all the billowing smoke and was repeatedly yelling \"this is the exit\" \"exit.\"\n\nThis is something that I hope sticks with a lot of people, this guy probably saved so many lives.

You can't criminalize miscarriages, you can't criminalize abortions from rape or incest, you can't even criminalize abortion or else you are creating a black market that does nothing but harm.  Making abortion illegal would do nothing except create more misery than we experience right now.  Yes, pro-lifers think that abortion causes misery by definition but making it illegal also causes misery by definition. As a society we have a responsibility to limit the misery of people who have the capability of experiencing it not limiting the misery of something that represents the potential for a person who is capable of experiencing misery.\n\nIn the overall equation people who are pro-life think that the joy of more people would outweigh the misery that criminalizing abortion causes.

The \"right and wrong\" of abortion is kind of irrelevant, viewed that way, because even if it's \"wrong\" and \"killing babies\" it kind of has to be legal, because bodily autonomy is too important. The argument against abortion inherently argues that a person does not always own their own self (in this case, their reproductive system), which is ridiculous and dangerous.\n\nOnce the baby is actually brought to term, of course, it has its own bodily autonomy and is protected. But there's no such thing as a \"9th trimester abortion\".\n\nStill, though, I do understand the opposing viewpoint. But from a legal standpoint, they just don't have ground.

One of the first things my husband and I discussed before we started trying was what we would do if pre natal tests determined our baby had  a high chance of a life debilitating disability. I was quite surprised by how easily the agreement to terminate came to me.

I generally don't disagree with you, but what you're saying is a bit idealized compared to my everyday experience. I see women for obstetric complaints on every single shift, and so I hear a *lot* of my patient's stories and attitudes regarding their experiences with abortion. \n\nGranted, I am in an academic emergency department who sees a huge number underserved Medicaid patients, so my sample is not representative of the population at large, but there is definitely a contingent who approaches abortion much more casually. It's still not a no-big-deal type of thing, but it's not a gnaw-your-own-leg-off type of thing either. There are large numbers of women, particularly urban African-American women, who regard it as a second-line birth control. A huge, huge number of African-American pregnancies in the US end by elective abortion, I think actually more than half of them if I recall the stats correctly but don't quote me on that, but for sure at least in my patient population, about half of young African-American women tell me that they have had an elective abortion. They grow up seeing that often mother and many of their friends have undergone abortions, and when it's relatively commonplace in a culture, it eventually seems more like a normal part of reproductive life than the way most women regard it. \n\nObviously your point stands that no one wants it like they want an ice cream cone, but for many, it's taken at least a little bit more lightly than your quote suggests. I would liken it to the way a hormonal implant or an intrauterine device is regarded. Everyone would prefer not to need it at all, but there isn't quite as much hesitation and consternation within some populations as many privileged men and women might imagine.\n\nAnyway, I just thought I'd share my experience. I'm one of relatively few people who gets to directly hear the attitudes of a patient population. That said, I am not an OB/GYN, I only hear from women who end up in the ER for OB complaints rather than the ones who call their OB and get directly admitted to the hospital, and I only see the patients at my big academic center. My experience would be 100% different if I were an OB practicing at an affluent community hospital out in a suburb where everyone is insured and makes very different life choices.

But past efforts at suppression masked their true intentions by having \"equal\" regulations as well. So technically the laws were objective and neutral, but in effect they prevented minorities from exercising rights. The \"equal\" rules weren't De jure racist but were de facto racist. Same thing with voter ID. There are probably a million reasons why minorities have lower rates of possessing IDs but the important thing to remember is that they don't have them. And they can't vote. Essentially, mission accomplished.\n\n\nThat brings us to today. \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/us/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-north-carolina-voter-id-provision.html?_r=0\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/us/federal-appeals-court-strikes-down-north-carolina-voter-id-provision.html?_r=0\n\n\nYou can see by other respondents that there are people who insist that this is all \"equal\" and that voter id is perfectly ok.

Consider that 175 F-22s are in service now with about 150 F-35's now delivered, just 6 PAK's were ever built with now real word on an actual production line. While its final engine has yet to be built and it has gone so bad India has gone from wanting dozens of them to at most a squadron and starting their own domestic program while Russia is looking to order at most about double that. WHile forcing them to go buy more SU-35's which are not Gen 5 in truth just a heavily upgraded Flanker which you can only do so many times and get diminishing returns. It would be like is the USN went and got another heavily updated F-18 derivative.

There is a culture of hazing and abuse that occurs because the level of liability is so high that people are constantly being thrown under the bus for things the person directly above them did.  They call it \"paying your dues\", but everyone is miserable.  The doctors have no bedside manner because that's not why they became doctors.  They became doctors because they could afford to take 10 years off and go to an expensive university, so they are inherently out of touch.  The medical assistants for the most part are only there because they thought it was the fastest and cheapest way to stable employment.  The nurses are the only ones who are ever decent people and they are always being shit on by the doctors.  I knew one nurse who worked in a hospital for 30 years before being let go right before they would've had to give her a pension.  They told her she could go \"per diem\", the bastards.

They didn't seem annoyed or frustrated and asked me if I had any questions, even though English was their second language and they knew I was a tourist.  They were just nicer.  Also, despite what you might think, I found at least two of them to be cleaner than your average US hospital.  I witnessed the staff washing their hands a lot.  Working in an OBGYN clinic in Seattle (one of the top ones in the nation, I'll let you know) we were routinely told NOT to wash our hands because it takes too much time and instructed to use hand sanitizer instead which doesn't actually get rid of filth it just sterilizes it.  So, there's that.  They actually washed their fucking hands, which is nice.\n\nAlso, when I left I was charged $25 for what would've easily cost $900 in the US.  They had done some blood work and a UA, but I was only charged for labor and cost of materials, I guess, as opposed to the US where the massive inflation is due to a lot of things, but largely because of the amount of insurance doctors need to cover their asses.

From that very source:\n\n> This is only a guideline figure, of course, as some cars may be more efficiently produced than others of the same price.

Producing a medium-sized new car costing \u00a324,000 may generate more than 17 tonnes of CO2e \u2013 almost as much as three years' worth of gas and electricity in the typical UK home.\n\nNow I don't know about you but if i were to buy a car I'd expect to get at least 10 years out of it, preferably 15.
