You just cannot not love him when he's managing your team. He basically made Chelsea what they are today, although most of his core players like Terry, Lampard y Drogba are gone, except for Terry. But the latter is still there, and I'm absolutely certain that his locker room presence gives a lot to the players, especially to the youth or the to the ones who have just joined the club. He's a club legend of yours and from a neutral point of view I hope he stays with Chelsea as some sort of a coach.\n\nAbsolutely agreed with you regarding those players. But the thing with Mourinho is that he mostly likes to keep the winning formula so to speak. He's slowly getting there with my beloved Manutd, and I'm so happy that he has finally seen the worth of Mhkitaryan and has started to play him. He's a gem and could turn our season around.\n\nMartial has had some sort of off-field problems recently, and that might reflect on his performances lately. Although he was really good against West Ham scoring two goals, also slowly setting the club back 10M euros since he's approaching the amount of goals scored which is a clause in his contract. 4 goals away from it if I recall it correctly.\n\nTFM is still young and is for the future. I hope we'll stay in the mickey mouse cup and FA Cup so he'll get his chances. \n\nRashford has been played so much actually, so I don't know what you're on about regarding him, no offence. Either on the left or right flank he's almost always starting. What I'm afraid of and lots of pundits have been saying, Mourinho could risk him getting a \"burnout\" because of playing so much at top level at such young age. But if he's up for it then all for the better.\n\nAgreed about Lingard.\n\nBack to Martial - he's had off field problems (breaking up with his gf or something) which might be hindering his performances, but like I said he's slowly picking it up. \n\nBoth Martial and Rashford feature regurarly under Mourinho, although now that Mhkiyaryan has come into contention, and Mata playing so well, one of them has to be dropped.

Not to undermine the quality of the league itself, but when it comes to the EPL, top teams rarely start their players from youth teams as their main forwards out of the blue. Rashford got his chance in the Europa League at first bailing us out with two goals. Then we literally had no one else to play up front against Arsenal because of the injuries, and he shined again. So basically he took the most of the chances he got and remained in the starting XI until the end of the season after that. Luck played played a lot of part in him getting his chances and he made the most of it. \n\nTop teams in the EPL usually don't trust their youth players in important matches and give them debuts like that.

I remember this match against Arsenal in the end of the season when the guy was brought on for Rojo who had had a really solid game for reason that goes above and beyond me.. And guess what, the guy fucking messed up and Walcott (I believe it was) equalized in the dying minutes from his flank. So some of his experiments if you will were quite shoddy. Paddy McNair and some other dude being one of them... \n\nAlso his subs at times made no sense.. Our defining CL groupstage match and he brings on Nick fucking Powell... Or Ashley Young on as a striker after the guy had been out for fucking months.

The last three WC finals went to extra time, so did the last Euro final. Also the last FA Cup and CL finals.  The hope is by allowing an extra sub in extra time, there's less risk in making more aggressive subs in regular time, and that leads to more regular time results.\n\n* Cramps happen.  Players train to play 90 minute games all year, so a 120 minute game requires playing at a slower pace if you can't take risks.  That again leads to conservative play that ends up with extra time as an outcome.  That's not awesome either.  So by adding a sub, you reduce the risk of playing at a higher level, which leads to better football.\n\n* Subs in tie games are usually important to breaking the deadlock.  the more you make it possible, the more likely those deadlocks get broken.

Napoli were one of the biggest spenders in Italy in the mid to late 80's. Look at the players they brought in after Maradona signed\n\n\n\n**Careca** - Arguably the best Brazilian striker of the 80's. Signed for Napoli on the back of scoring 5 at the 1986 World Cup. Was also top scorer in Brazil and named South American player of the year.\n\n\n**Alemao** - Signed from Atletico Madrid where he was named the best foreign player in Spain, having previously been voted the best player in South America. Was part of the 1986 Brazil World Cup squad.\n\n\n**Ferrara** - one of the best defenders of his generation in Italy, over 40 odd caps for Italy and went on to win many trophies as the main man in the Juventus defence.\n\n\n\n**Di Napoli** - Over 50 caps for Italy and went on to play for AC Milan in the early 90's. Played in 1986 WC. 1988 euros, 1990 WC.\n\n**Bagni** - Over 40 caps for Italy and was part of the 1986 WC squad.\n\n**Crippa** - 17 caps for Italy\n\n**Francini** - Italian intl who was in the Italy squad for 1988 euros.\n\n**Carnevale** - striker played for Italy at the 1990 WC\n\n**Fusi** - Italian intl who was in the 1988 euros squad\n\n**Zola** - Younger years at Napoli where he won his first cap.\n\nThe squad that Napoli had was second only to Milan in terms of players. Almost all those named above were brought in after Napoli started spending big and brought in Maradona. Its a tired line to say Maradona joined a relegation threatened Napoli and turned them into champions. It just isnt true. He was the best player in a strong squad.\n\n>or winning WC with bunch of no names.\n\nThey only allowed 5 goals all tournament long. That number, no matter the era they played in, is phenomenal. This by itself demolishes the myth of Maradona \"doing it by himself\". Meanwhile, his partner on offense wasn't bad either: Jorge Valdano (of RM) scored 4 in the same tournament. To top it all off, he was coached by what a lot of people rightfully consider one of the greatest WC managers in history, Carlos Bilardo.\n\nSure, Maradona was by far the player of the tournament, scoring 5 and assisting 5. He was involved in 10 of Argentina's 14 goals in 7 matches. That is very impressive, but it didn't mean that the rest of the team were poor.\n\nTo put it in perspective, in Euro 84, Michael Platini scored 9 goals in 5 matches, including the winner that sent them to the Finals. Platini doubled in one tournament Diego's career goal total in the Copa America (4) but hardly anyone called/calls it a one-man effort. Was it because Maradona did it in the World Cup? I am inclined to say yes.\n\n", "id": "daqiyvy"}, {"comment": "Argentine won the wc also 1978 without maradona so I wouldn't call them a bunch of no names", "id": "daqiise"}, {"comment": "Any top 100 of all time on that squad from 1978?, don't think so", "id": "daqinvf"}, {"comment": "Is messi/ronaldo playing with any player who's in the  top 100 of all time?", "id": "daqiq65"}, {"comment": "Eder", "id": "daqo8d2"}, {"comment": "Xavi, Iniesta?

You also have to consider the psychological aspect, for some players it's better to insist and make them play again and again, for some it's better to bench them to make them realize that they have to do more. And you also have Nice and Monaco who are winning a lot so there is less room for rotating and trying things. AND the national cups haven't even started yet. So yeah, honestly I don't want to blame Emery for this. \n\nI also think you're making too many conclusions from this game, I honestly thought we would lose tonight, in the middle of winter, with a Matuidi-Krychowiak-Nkunku midfield, Kurzawa playing with the fear of getting injured again, before a cup game, a CL game, and a 6 points game vs Nice. Not to mention the onside goal refused to Cavani and the fact that Montpellier shot 3 times for 3 goals. As I said we had this kind of game against Blanc too, it simply happens. \n\nIt's also more difficult for Emery to put his system in place because 1/ we have no 10 2/ the way Ligue 1 teams park the bus against us. We want to play fast transition for the CL but it's really difficult to practice this in Ligue 1 because of this, so we have this weird mix of trying to have the possession and trying to counter attack and it feels like we're not improving in what Emery wants to put in place. Ofcourse the defense is more shaky this way than with a pure possession style, but I really believe that we can't go far in CL if we keep playing pure possession style. But as you say it \"finally\" showed today, implying that the defense has been good for now, and yes it has been.

Sort of a playmaker/false nine, and so far Wenger has done right by playing him in that role instead of Giroud, and using the latter as a super-sub so to speak. \n\nWhen given freedom, Alexis is spectacular. It's no wonder that the Chilenos have won the Copa Am\u00e9rica two years running with Alexis and DON'T FORGET VIDAL being essential for them in progress.

Two basic examples being when a team is defending or attacking. \n\nNot sure if you can be bothered reading through all this, but for example when the team is defending it's usually Coquelin dropping in front of defence, with his partner, let's say Xhaka being a tad bit further forward, and also the wingers or wide men dropping back (Walcott y Ox), \u00d6zil has pretty much a free role and while he also does drop back a bit, wasting his energy on defending too much would limit him offensively, Alexis is renowned for his extreme workrate and he might even drop further back than \u00d6zil at times despite being played in that new role as sort of a false nine. So that's you guys defending basically with a 4-1-4-1 formation.\n\nWhen you're attacking it transforms into 4-2-3-1 or even 4-3-3 with Coquelin sitting mostly back, Xhaka further forward, the wingers widening the play and both \u00d6zil and Alexis dropping between the lines to get the ball and start moves. \n\nI mean the team's formation changes so much throughout the course of the match, I brought you two very basic examples already. Also it has a lot to do with whether the team is leading or trailing, the manager or someone from his staff having noticed a weakness from the opposing side that they could exploit etc.\n\nIf you watched el clasico for example yesterday, then at times Real Madrid were sort of lined up like this: http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=d4sy2\n\nWith them playing basically with two strikers and no left winger, Marcelo was pushed up forward so he mostly was playing that role. Isco was everywhere doing a lot of pressing up front and in the back. Modri\u0107 being the anchor so to speak of the midfield with Kovacic doing loads of dirty work. Most of their attacks came from the right side of the field.\n\nWith Barcelona lining up like this at the same time - http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=d4sy3\n\nSimilarly most of their attacks were coming from the right side. Andr\u00e9 Gomes seemed to play a bit further back from Busquets with Messi trying to make up for the absence of Iniesta at first dropping deep and creating plays. \n\nBoth of the systems changed so much throughout the game and also with the subsitutes. For example after Casemiro came on for Real Madrid, both Modri\u0107 and Kovacic could breathe a little easier having their backs covered etc.\n\nIniesta coming on for Barcelona forced Busquets into his natural role further back and completely improved their game. Anyway I could go on and on but yeah..\n\nWhat my point is that the tactical aspect of the game can be quite interesting and there is no certain formation at all times. \n", "id": "darp2t8"}, {"comment": "Vidal was more important for the first cup and they were about the same in the second one.

They got Mikel [Arruabarrena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arruabarrena) instead and Legia's sporting director told Lewy's club that they are not interested in Robert anymore. \n\nArruabarrena turned out to be one of the worst transfers in Legia's history. I think he only played in 6 games for them, but had one of the league's highest wages. Lewy got transferred to one of Legia's main rivals and very quickly became one of the country's most reliable goal scorers. He [did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FycmZjg1UwM) in his league debut.\n\nA quote from a conversation between Legia's sporting director and a representative of Lewy's lower league club is a meme among Polish football fans. \"You can sell him elsewhere now.

Ended up drinking as his newly wed wife conceived a child with his own brother.\n\nIt's not that easy to tell who will be world class in ten years and who will spend his life kicking the ball in the 6th league.

When the ball was out-wide they did brilliantly to double up on Neymar every time and limit him from being direct forcing him to cut back time after time. Bar\u00e7a actually defended well and a key part of this was the second coverage from Alba or Roberto, once a centre back was beaten they're automatically in to cover. Madrids attack suffered without Bale with it being more narrow in general on the counters than if Bale was playing.\n\nIt was a shame Madrid switched off just that one set piece you can't afford to do and that's the main issue with just primarily attempting to defend crosses you can't switch off for one minute otherwise you're given the attacker a yard on you to make a movement. The most important difference of the second half was Bar\u00e7a pressing high up against Madrid, this caused quick transitions when the ball was won not allowing Madrid to set up like they did first half, therefore disrupting their defensive shape.

Lots of dodgy tackles and poor clearances. Kolarov seemed aware of his lack of pace today, and it really hurt City's chances of getting anything out of this game.\n\nAguero's tackle was reckless but I understand the frustration there - the game had been lost, and Luiz was a good as target as any, considering his strong interceptions all game. Not excusing him, but atleast I can understand why he did it. Fernandinho, on the other hand, completely lost his cool. Surely he was aware that Aguero was already sent off?

You simply don't get to do that; you gotta give respect if you want to receive it. Also, I didn't say you were an ass, but that you looked like one by dismissing any opinion challenging yours as \"absurd\". Maybe that you are a very interesting and intelligent dude outside of that comment of yours, but that specific one painted you in a light that is difficult to describe with another word than \"ass\".\n\nThe Ballon d'Or was supposed to reward the players that did a great season, that performed very well for a year; it was never to reward the best player in a vacuum, which is your argument. Yes, Messi is the best player in football's History *in a vacuum*. In real football, some players in some situations were more useful. In real football, some seasons had a Messi far less dominant and an Iniesta/Xavi duo walking on everyone's head.\n\nTo put it in other words, if I had to buy a player for the next 10 years, I'd buy Messi. If I had to buy a player for a single season, and that my choices are 2010 Messi or 2010 Iniesta, I'm taking Iniesta.

You think Iniesta's utility was greater. I'm saying go back and re-watch important games. Busi, Xavi and Iniesta provided stability and space but they worked as a unit. Xavi had come of his record breaking assist season and was already much more a balance player than the year before which rubbed off on Iniesta at Barca. He still created, but individually Messi was far more important both before and after Pep moved him to the false nine. ", "id": "dartnvd"}, {"comment": "I'm saying the same, go back and re-watch important games. Hint: Messi didn't win the World Cup, nor the Champions League. No major title for him this season. If he was that good in \"important games\", he would have won.\n\nScoring goals is blinding people, but hey, it's shiny, you can see it. It's palpable, you can say \"he did the hat-trick !\" and admire the guy. It's very different for someone working in the shadow; basically, you're saying \"hey the wheel of this car is what made that car win the race\", forgetting about the engine, the brakes or the suspensions. Messi is, as I said, probably the best player in History, but he's still just a player, and a *very* specific one. I strongly hinted at it already when I asked why he is not performing as well in Argetina NT; he requires the very-best players behind him to balance his absolutely abysmal workrate. He is the opposite of Cavani; he never works for the team, never does pressing, never covers a team mate that might have pushed too high.\n\nI'm not only sayin Iniesta's utility was greater, I'm also saying Iniesta's utility enabled Messi's talent. And that this kind of player, that is individually world-class and also collectively world-class are extremely rare and sometimes (not always) more precious than a top finisher; this is why the Ballon d'Or used to be about something else than the player with the best stats in the latest FIFA game.", "id": "daruc1z"}, {"comment": "Difference is, he called your argument by a name.

By using public facilities like roads, schools etc. and paying fewer (less taxes? can you count taxes? I guess) taxes than the government intended him to pay he didn't fulfill his end of the bargain. Especially schools because he probably got more than he paid for. He was impoverished and certainly paid less as a family in taxes than he got in benefits. At least in the US, I know that the top one percent of people pay almost half of all income tax, and we can argue about whether that is right or not later. The point is, he used the benefits of society while rich people subsidized it. That is an economic fact. Now he is rich and is paying fewer taxes than intended therefore failing to subsidize someone else's benefits. Therefore he violates his social contract and is acting immorally.
