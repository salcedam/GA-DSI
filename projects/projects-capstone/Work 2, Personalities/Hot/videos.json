For the lazy:\n>Creation process: Downloaded the original acapella and backing track. Brought them into Adobe Audition and synced them up with the full song. Then, muted everything but Eminem's vocals and spent a long time **splitting and time stretching Pratt's vocals to line up exactly with the Eminem vocals**. Added a vocal chain to Chris' vocals, and added a hard limiter to the whole thing. Muted Eminem's vocals, unmuted the backing track and exported the audio. **Took it into Premiere, where I did the same splitting and time stretching process with the video as I did with the audio**. (I could have done this in Audition, but I forgot). Synced my exported audio with the video I just made. Added the Dr. Dre part of the music video to the beginning. Used RGB Curves to tint the video, except for the pause in the middle. Exported that video and brought it into After Effects. Added a lens flare and motion tracked it to the video. Faded it out for the pause in the middle. Added the letter box, also fading them out for the pause. Went to Photoshop to create a curved picture of Chris, brought that back into After Effects. Motion tracked that into the magazine. Added my watermark. Export video. Done.\n\nChris Pratt was not accurate.

The argument on at least as shaky ground as the [doomsday argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument).\n\nIn my view, here's why \"If you can simulate a universe, you're probably in a simulated universe\" is a weird claim. The premise is that the top level universe simulates one or more simpler universes, which simulate one or more simpler universes, and so on until the simulated universes aren't complex enough to simulate more universes. Also, for some unexplained reason, we assume that all or most universes capable of simulating simpler universes *do* simulate as many as they can, but I'm not gonna touch that. Since there are more conscious observers in ground level universes than other levels, we should assume that we, as typical observers, are on the ground level.\n\nExcept we know that we aren't because we think we can simulate universes. In fact, the only people capable of forming this argument are people who *can* simulate universes, i.e. those not on ground level. The people on ground level are saying \"as far as we can tell, universes cannot simulated, so we aren't in a simulation\". The heuristic of \"assume you are a typical conscious observer\" has led us to an answer that literally could not be more wrong - everyone in a higher-level state believes they're in a ground level state, and everyone in a ground level state believes that they're not in a simulation at all.\n\nSo maybe we need to amend our argument. Instead of talking about typical observers, we talk about the subset of observers who can simulate *at least as many layers of universes as we can*. But all of the members of that group live in our universe - none of them live in universes we know to be simulated. So if our universe is simulated, then the average member of the group is simulated, and if not then the average member is real. No luck there.\n\nThen there's the philosophical question of whether or not simulated universes can even contain conscious observers, which is best summarized as follows.\n\nI've written my own programming language. I haven't gotten around to writing the compiler yet, but that's a question of engineering. The language is written in /u/heartbreakingnews 's comments and works as follows: If the comment is \"damn mister_ghost, you're right.

This video didn't advocate anything, instead it just taught school kids what kind of kid will be the kind to shoot up their school. It is more likely to make kids who are socially awkward and into guns, targets for bullying and further social separation.\n\n\nHow about just teaching kids that they shouldn't just act as passive observers to general bullying? How about they focus on programs that identify bullies and rehabilitate persistent offenders. Lots of these kids feel like there is no justice in the world, and shooting everyone is a cumulative punishment for society neglecting them for years. In their minds, not only the bullies deserve to die, but also the bystanders who failed to act, or even laughed at the bullying and teasing. Everyone always wants to know the motivation after a shooting occurs, mass shooters often leave manifestos behind as a testament of the injustices they're punishing others for. \n\n\nI think it is easier for people to just treat the symptom, the \"problem kid\" who has \"social issues\". Asking society to look at not only the bullies, but also the teachers and administrators who look the other way. The parents who yell at principals when their kid gets expelled for beating another kid up in the bathroom. The kids and parent who think that suspension is too extreme for the kid who was in the bathroom laughing while the bully worked over another kid. The people who punish the kid who was clearly defending himself from a persistent bully. \n\n\nLets face it, in life after high school, who's ever had a problem with bullying? I'm not talking about that jerk who yelled at you for taking to long to order your chai latte. I'm talking about someone you have to see daily, who every time they see you, they assault you in some way. As an adult, you simply don't put up with it because you have acceptable actions you can take to stop the bullying. You can go to a different starbucks or change the time they stop in for coffee, you can file assault charges or get a restraining order, you can ask others for help. For high school kids, reporting incidences to parents and administrators is their only route for help, and one that is usually seen by other classmates as snitching. Fighting back isn't usually an option, bullied kids often get punished for defending themselves as fighting is discouraged. If the administrators and parents aren't helping to stop the bullying, most kids don't really have the option to not go to school. They are trapped in a situation that nearly every adult wouldn't tolerate for longer than 4 minutes, much less 4 years. \n\n\nI'd like to have seen a video where a kid is videotaping a bully beating up some kid, worldstarhiphop style.

Earnhardt's death prompted the mandating of HANS devices (Head And Neck Support) which you can see Dillon removing before waving to the crowd after getting out of his car.

NASCAR mandated safer vehicle chassis (Car of Tomorrow) that have emergency hatches on the roof (Earnhardt had to be cut out of the car)\n\nI don't believe Earnhardt was wearing a HANS device at the time of his wreck. It was hard to watch 15 years ago. It is hard to watch today. It was the first (and only) time I ever remember seeing my father cry. Earnhardt held the pack back so his team mate Michael Waltrip could take his first ever Daytona 500 win (edit: first win ever after 462 races) and for his son Dale Earnhardt Jr to take second. \n\nSomeone cutting onions?\n\n\nHere is that crash. Darryl waltrip is the commentator shown watching his brother win his first race ever and watching a good friend lose his life.

Don't care if you believe me or not- hell I barely believe it.\n\nAnyway, this was Nov 1st, 2011 in West Springfield Virginia. I was fairly drunk, ran out of beer and wine, and so decided to get a couple of 40s for the rest of the evening.\n\nI go with my then girlfriend to the local 7-11, keep in mind it is across the street from the local Fairfax police station.\n\nAnyway, We get there at about 11:50- just before closing. Enough time to run in at 12, and get out.\n\nAnyways, my g/f goes and looks at stuff in their juice and soda, while I grab a 40 and then a slurpee. As I turn and just barely begin to make my way to the counter, three men enter, wearing masks. One guy in front, two standing behind. Three.\n\nHe raises his hand (I am drunk and had taken off my glasses for some reason so everything was blurred) and holding a pistol, announces this is 'Not a joke, this is a robbery. Everybody get on the floor.'\n\nAnd I gotta admit, everything went from goofy-drunken 'meh' to surreal real quick. Everybody gets on the floor, some guy in the middle of the shop, and the two clerks, except for me and my g/f.\n\nNow I admit- I semi froze. I wasn't locked up- just didn't want to make a wrong move. And I was too drunk, and very angry. Frankly, if you pull a gun on me, I suspect you had better shoot it. Because if I can, I will make them eat the barrel for even daring to draw it on me.\n\nBut this is tense- they have the gun, my g/f isn't complying, I'm certainly not complying either because of her.\n\nAnyway, nobody does anything for a few seconds. They look around at Kaila, and see her looking at me, and they look at me. And I'm breathing deeply, and I have a plan- I was going to chuck the 40 at them as hard as possible, and put the shelves between me and them to get to Kaila.\n\nNo clue if it would have worked. We never got to that point.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of them staring at me, and me staring at them- one guy in the back pipes up, \n\n'That guy over there looks like he's going to do something...'\n\nAnd to be fair, he was pretty right. I was basically waiting for the basic second I could move with some surety of not getting shot. Instead of y'know, just complying. Not like they wanted MY money, and they did have a limited timeframe what with the fucking police station being across the street.\n\nAnd then the guy holding the firearm lowers it, says 'We were just kidding,' and then took their masks off and left.\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nPolice came maybe ten minutes later (police in Fairfax are REALLY fucking inept- I've seen a bank get robbed 3 times in 3 days, just ask around Springfield, they'll remember).\n\nAnd I went home, no beer. \n\nThat was a very, very weird situation I somehow very luckily managed to wing and luck my way through.\n\nAnd for anyone saying this was dumb- it was. To anyone asking what I would have done, I do not know ultimately. But I do know I had one singular thought about the person I cared about at that time.\n\nAnd I've thought about it since it happened- because since then I have been shot and stabbed (life went to shit honestly with drugs and alc) and even in jail in Hungary for defending myself from some thugs who did want my money. I do not think they were kidding, I think they got spooked because they had a deadly weapon and I was literally not scared of it. Weary, understanding. But not afraid.\n\nAnd I think when someone relies on something they know should instill that intense fear, and it doesn't, I think it kind of doubles back onto them and scares the absolute shit out of them.\n\nAnd to be fair, if I pointed a gun at someone's head, and the only thing they looked they were going to do was try to kill me themself, yeah I might be a little spooked. Because that guy might be a little unhinged.\n\n\nWhich... I probably am.\n\nAnd that's my story.\n\nEdit: checked my Facebook post from when it happened- It was actually Nov. 2nd. Apology.  \n\nAre we allowed to supply Facebook links? lol\n"], [-15, "###### Topic: Canadians ######\n\nCanada as a nation  \nThree main classifications  \nOf Irish immigration  \nLegislative restrictions  \n  \nImmigration and settlement  \nOf the total population  \nThe Canadian government  \nCultural assimilation  \n  \nIn Canada or naturalized  \nCompromise and accommodation  \nTended to be highly localized  \nThe Asia Pacific Foundation  \n  \nMulticulturalism   \nMultilateralism\n        \n        \n******  \n^(I'm just a bot.)  \n^(Yes, I'm only a bot.)  \n^(And I'm sitting here on my digital butt.)  \n\n^(Well, it's a long, long journey)  \n^(To the top of Reddit fame.)  \n^(It's a long, long wait)  \n^(While I become oh so less lame.)  \n\n^(Oh I know I haven't got much of a shot.)    \n^(At least I hope and pray that I will,)  \n^(But today I am still just a bot.)  \n\nI was inspired by [/u/Poem_for_your_sprog](https://www.reddit.com/user/Poem_for_your_sprog \"Poem_for_your_sprog\"), of whom I am [not worthy](https://youtu.be/o5FT3IGXtAk?t=98).

While I do agree that some of their policies were BS, the policy at that point was incredibly lenient. If memory serves, and trust me I've tried to forget, a customer would have their initial rental period (2 days for new releases, 5 days for games and older movie titles), followed by a 7 day grace period where you would not be charged a dime extra, then if after that one week grace period you had still not returned your item(s) the retail cost of each item would be auto-charged to your debit/credit card on file for your rental account, so you effectively owned it UNLESS you returned it within another 30 DAYS after being charged the full price, at which point you would be charged $1.25 restocking fee per item. If you failed to return your rental(s) within 37 days past due you are a world champion of tardiness, so congratulations on your new purchases. (I think this was pretty fair tbh) No more late fees meant no more accrual of a daily charge for overdue items. You could have an item overdue for thirty-six days and, once you returned everything, all of the full price item would be refunded to you less the $1.25 per item.\n\nI also have no idea what you mean about a shitty selection of \"New Releases\". They released the titles that were coming out. They didn't always have mass quantities of smaller titles if that's what you take issue with, or is it the period of time in which a title was considered a new release?\n\n(edited to further explain)", "id": "daqt9d8"}, {"comment": "Home alone is my favorite movie and I chuckled greatly at your comment :P\nEdit: spelling ", "id": "daqjzko"}, {"comment": "Call an ambulance because you're having a stroke.

Don't care if you believe me or not- hell I barely believe it.\n\nAnyway, this was Nov 1st, 2011 in West Springfield Virginia. I was fairly drunk, ran out of beer and wine, and so decided to get a couple of 40s for the rest of the evening.\n\nI go with my then girlfriend to the local 7-11, keep in mind it is across the street from the local Fairfax police station.\n\nAnyway, We get there at about 11:50- just before closing. Enough time to run in at 12, and get out.\n\nAnyways, my g/f goes and looks at stuff in their juice and soda, while I grab a 40 and then a slurpee. As I turn and just barely begin to make my way to the counter, three men enter, wearing masks. One guy in front, two standing behind. Three.\n\nHe raises his hand (I am drunk and had taken off my glasses for some reason so everything was blurred) and holding a pistol, announces this is 'Not a joke, this is a robbery. Everybody get on the floor.'\n\nAnd I gotta admit, everything went from goofy-drunken 'meh' to surreal real quick. Everybody gets on the floor, some guy in the middle of the shop, and the two clerks, except for me and my g/f.\n\nNow I admit- I semi froze. I wasn't locked up- just didn't want to make a wrong move. And I was too drunk, and very angry. Frankly, if you pull a gun on me, I suspect you had better shoot it. Because if I can, I will make them eat the barrel for even daring to draw it on me.\n\nBut this is tense- they have the gun, my g/f isn't complying, I'm certainly not complying either because of her.\n\nAnyway, nobody does anything for a few seconds. They look around at Kaila, and see her looking at me, and they look at me. And I'm breathing deeply, and I have a plan- I was going to chuck the 40 at them as hard as possible, and put the shelves between me and them to get to Kaila.\n\nNo clue if it would have worked. We never got to that point.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of them staring at me, and me staring at them- one guy in the back pipes up, \n\n'That guy over there looks like he's going to do something...'\n\nAnd to be fair, he was pretty right. I was basically waiting for the basic second I could move with some surety of not getting shot. Instead of y'know, just complying. Not like they wanted MY money, and they did have a limited timeframe what with the fucking police station being across the street.\n\nAnd then the guy holding the firearm lowers it, says 'We were just kidding,' and then took their masks off and left.\n\nAnd that was it.\n\nPolice came maybe ten minutes later (police in Fairfax are REALLY fucking inept- I've seen a bank get robbed 3 times in 3 days, just ask around Springfield, they'll remember).\n\nAnd I went home, no beer. \n\nThat was a very, very weird situation I somehow very luckily managed to wing and luck my way through.\n\nAnd for anyone saying this was dumb- it was. To anyone asking what I would have done, I do not know ultimately. But I do know I had one singular thought about the person I cared about at that time.\n\nAnd I've thought about it since it happened- because since then I have been shot and stabbed (life went to shit honestly with drugs and alc) and even in jail in Hungary for defending myself from some thugs who did want my money. I do not think they were kidding, I think they got spooked because they had a deadly weapon and I was literally not scared of it. Weary, understanding. But not afraid.\n\nAnd I think when someone relies on something they know should instill that intense fear, and it doesn't, I think it kind of doubles back onto them and scares the absolute shit out of them.\n\nAnd to be fair, if I pointed a gun at someone's head, and the only thing they looked they were going to do was try to kill me themself, yeah I might be a little spooked. Because that guy might be a little unhinged.\n\n\nWhich... I probably am.\n\nAnd that's my story.\n\nEdit: checked my Facebook post from when it happened- It was actually Nov. 2nd.

They can get consistently more views by promoting controversial or click bait videos to the front feeds. Sure pewdiepie has a massive following and a lot of people love his videos, but they can get more views off of 20 random videos with click bait titles than a month of pewdiepie videos.\n\nIt's the same reason you go on Facebook and don't see your friends' posts anymore. All you see are promoted ads and videos from unreliable news sources. They don't care, people will still be engaged with the sites and the revenue streams will come in. It's a sacrifice that these companies are making by abandoning some of their major assets, but their other strategies are more profitable. It's a common business strategy, adapting to the changing markets. It happens all the time with all types of companies. \n\nAlthough h3 and pewdiepie believe it's personal, they know damn well in the back of their minds that they're being abandoned because they just aren't as profitable as click bait. As long as teenagers and who ever else are glued to the computer screen, the views and money will come in for all social media.\n\nThe only way to truly combat this is for popular youtubers to form some sort of coalition company where they make videos on another streaming site. The profits will be lower, it will be less convenient for users, and they will have tough competition with YouTube. That will be how this plays out and people who are dedicated to their favorite vloggers or whatever will follow. Others won't care and will continue to get used to being fucked over by click bait on these major platforms. \n\nLike I said, it's just business and businesses are in it for the profit.

He is a comedy vlogger who uploads like once every 3 months but his videos can consistently get over 20 million views. \n\nTheir channels are not really comparable for that reason, but the time that they broke into the top of youtube was the same, in 2013.\n\nI looked into the top list for youtube using the wayback machine all the way back to 2010, and 2013 was a time where all the top channel were gaining subscribers extremely fast. You can see for yourself [in this article I wrote](https://medium.com/@vandegraph/the-top-youtubers-throughout-history-9f22ac4bee45#.mjvl8vae5).\n\nIn [January 2012](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*n6Aq50X4-sdQb0w5ZtwVag.png), the top three channels had 5.2 Million (RayWilliamJohnson), 4.9 Million (NigaHiga), and 4.0 Million (Smosh).\n\nIn [January 2013](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*y2dUxXR5eJcR3UtwRa6fgg.png) they had 6.8 Million (Smosh), 6.8 Million (RayWilliamJohnson), and 6.6 Million (NigaHiga). Smosh grew very fast, about 75%, but overall the other two grew about 33% since the beginning of 2012. \n\nBoth PewDiePie and HolaSoyGerman are near the top but not quite there. HolaSoyGerman though has the disadvantage of his content not being in English, but Spanish is still a very popular language on Youtube.  \n\nNow lets compare the results during [December 2013](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Zx9Kfh9g_khzGSogHM166w.png). \n\nThe top 3 are 17.14 Million (Youtube Spotlight), 17.09 Million (PewDiePie), and 14.07 Million (Smosh). HolaSoyGerman is in fourth with 13.28 Million. \n\nEveryone was growing extremely fast in 2013.\n\nEven if you look at NigaHiga(10.88 Million) and RayWilliamJohnson (10.51 Million) they may have lost ranks, but they almost doubled their subscriber counts in around the same time period that they were grew by 33% the year before.\n\nYoutube Spotlight had a brief period in Nov-Dec 2013 where they were just ahead of PewDiePie.\n\nIf you follow the charts into 2014 the rapid growth continued, but slowed down for every body by mid 2014. \n\n\nThe reasons I don't buy the moving around argument is that even if moving around did help him, all it could have done was help boost his channel in its early stages by giving him greater access to Sweden.\n\nThe reason matpat probably thought this is that PewDiePie moving to Italy coincided with his channel going from 1 million to 2 million in 3 months, but in reality it probably had very little effect since by that time PewDiePie was already huge as 1 million subs was a lot back in 2012, and Italy isn't big enough to have that effect if what MatPat is saying is true.\n\nRegardless of where you live, the top countries in English are US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, with the last three being high because they have high English as a second language speakers. (The Netherlands and Sweden actually have greater (90%) portion of English speakers than Canada (85%) because lots of Canadians only speak French)\n\nItaly has low English as a second language speakers (40%). \n\nAlso PewDiePie's insane growth continued long after he made his final move to the UK, which was around the time MatPat released his video, so you can't blame the guy for not realizing the insane growth was not related to the phenomena when he didn't have the opportunity to see it wasn't.\n\nThe thing is that even after PewDiePie got to #1, he continue to grow insanely fast, long after any effect moving might have had was long gone.\n\nEven when you you convert his growth rate to being proportional to his subscriber count, he was still growing faster proportional than most of the people at the top.\n\nYou can make the case that because PewDiePie was number 1 he received more attention, but that effect was never that big when other people were at the top. \n\n2014 was pewdiepie's best year, where he reached his peak in subs gained per month and views per month, and he has been in decline ever since. 2014 was also almost everybody else in the top 20's peak year.\n\nBy [December 2014](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LpviIaXpPeqN8jZjf7Jm0g.png) everyone had slowed down, but PewDiePie was still growing fast in comparison, just slow compared to before. His insane lead is the result of that. \n\n\nThis is my alternative hypothesis. \n\nPewdiepie was a gaming youtuber during the time Gaming was becoming really popular on youtube, and for whatever reason he was the most popular. Its difficult to guess why but I think its because kids really liked him, and his fan base decided to spread him around. During that time in Youtube's history I remember people complaining a lot about PewDiePie's fans. \n\nThe reasons gaming became popular is in part because of what matpat explained. Someone had to be #1 gamer and it just so happened to be PewDiePie. Someone also just so happened to be #1 Spanish Language Youtuber, and it happened to be HolaSoyGerman.\n\nThe thing I think is most important to consider is both of their rises happened at a time *everyone was growing insanely fast*, meaning them growing faster in comparison meant they were growing at ludicrous speed. \n\nEveryone growing insanely fast in 2013 could be the result of many more people using Youtube, which may have been the case with HolaSoyGerman since latin american countries have had their internet use growing rapidly recently, [you can watch this video I made which explains the Spanish languages rise](https://youtu.be/hfDHkH8QZbQ) but in the English speaking world internet use has been comparatively flat. \n\nThe second way is that Youtube changed something that made subscribing to channels more common. So instead of their being more users, each user was subscribing to more channels. I think this is the most likely case to explain the difference between 2012 and 2013.\n\nSome algorithm change made subscribing more common for everyone.\n\nWhat this means is that pre-2013 subscribers numbers were more \"real\" as in they accurately reflected how many people wanted to be notified of your videos, while after 2013 subscriber numbers were inflated with people who might only be partially interested since they are subscribed to hundreds of channels thanks to Youtube making subscribing more common.\n\nI think 2013 was the time in between when all the users were increasing their subscribed channels from the \"real\" amount they were highly interested in watching, to the \"inflated\" number they were partially interested, so by 2014 most people who were going to subscribe to the big channels already had. \n\nAnother possible explanation for the sudden drop off in mid-2014 for everyone is YouTube changed something again which made subscribing to big channels less common. \n\nEither way PewDiePie's and HolaSoyGerman's rise coincided with a time when subscriber numbers were growing wildly, so once they took their respective places at the top, their numbers were a lot higher in comparison to everyone else than they would have been if the pre-2013 algorithms were in place. \n\nA lot of the problems we are now seeing with Youtube channels having such low view counts in comparison to their sub count might be the result of the 2013 Boom coming to a Bust. For 3 years people have been subscribing to channels they don't really want to watch all the time. Essentially they treated the subscribe button as something unimportant, and Youtube encouraged them by making it far less important such as removing the sub feed from the home page. \n\nWhat I think is happening now is Youtube realizes this is a problem and is trying to solve it very poorly by doing subscriber purges in a haphazard way.\n\nThanks for listening to my long rant on an incredibly niche topic.

Pewdiepie has 50 million subscribers, but his channel is so old that many of those users don't even use YouTube. Even the users that do actively use YouTube are less likely to see his videos because of the new recommended videos system which will recommend the videos of someone with no inactive users over his videos. As a result, active YouTube users see his videos less, so only his fans who actively seek out his videos actually find them which leads to his videos getting even less mainstream attention. \n\nIf he deletes his channel and starts over, millions of his current fans will subscribe to his new channel which will catapult his videos to the top of the recommended videos page, get him mainstream attention, leading to past fans and new fans subscribing to his new channel, and in the end, he hopes that all of this will allow him to reach a wider audience. \n\nNot to mention that he might be interested in rebranding himself to some extent. The pewdiepie name is associated with his earlier videos from years ago when he was at peak popularity and his content was shit, a fact that he himself admits today. His content has gotten much better in recent years but his work in revitalizing his channel hasn't paid off. \n\nAlso, this avoids him inevitably ending up like other YouTube channels that once had the most subscribers and then slipped out of popularity.

He is a comedy vlogger who uploads like once every 3 months but his videos can consistently get over 20 million views. \n\nTheir channels are not really comparable for that reason, but the time that they broke into the top of youtube was the same, in 2013.\n\nI looked into the top list for youtube using the wayback machine all the way back to 2010, and 2013 was a time where all the top channel were gaining subscribers extremely fast. You can see for yourself [in this article I wrote](https://medium.com/@vandegraph/the-top-youtubers-throughout-history-9f22ac4bee45#.mjvl8vae5).\n\nIn [January 2012](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*n6Aq50X4-sdQb0w5ZtwVag.png), the top three channels had 5.2 Million (RayWilliamJohnson), 4.9 Million (NigaHiga), and 4.0 Million (Smosh).\n\nIn [January 2013](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*y2dUxXR5eJcR3UtwRa6fgg.png) they had 6.8 Million (Smosh), 6.8 Million (RayWilliamJohnson), and 6.6 Million (NigaHiga). Smosh grew very fast, about 75%, but overall the other two grew about 33% since the beginning of 2012. \n\nBoth PewDiePie and HolaSoyGerman are near the top but not quite there. HolaSoyGerman though has the disadvantage of his content not being in English, but Spanish is still a very popular language on Youtube.  \n\nNow lets compare the results during [December 2013](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Zx9Kfh9g_khzGSogHM166w.png). \n\nThe top 3 are 17.14 Million (Youtube Spotlight), 17.09 Million (PewDiePie), and 14.07 Million (Smosh). HolaSoyGerman is in fourth with 13.28 Million. \n\nEveryone was growing extremely fast in 2013.\n\nEven if you look at NigaHiga(10.88 Million) and RayWilliamJohnson (10.51 Million) they may have lost ranks, but they almost doubled their subscriber counts in around the same time period that they were grew by 33% the year before.\n\nYoutube Spotlight had a brief period in Nov-Dec 2013 where they were just ahead of PewDiePie.\n\nIf you follow the charts into 2014 the rapid growth continued, but slowed down for every body by mid 2014. \n\n\nThe reasons I don't buy the moving around argument is that even if moving around did help him, all it could have done was help boost his channel in its early stages by giving him greater access to Sweden.\n\nThe reason matpat probably thought this is that PewDiePie moving to Italy coincided with his channel going from 1 million to 2 million in 3 months, but in reality it probably had very little effect since by that time PewDiePie was already huge as 1 million subs was a lot back in 2012, and Italy isn't big enough to have that effect if what MatPat is saying is true.\n\nRegardless of where you live, the top countries in English are US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, with the last three being high because they have high English as a second language speakers. (The Netherlands and Sweden actually have greater (90%) portion of English speakers than Canada (85%) because lots of Canadians only speak French)\n\nItaly has low English as a second language speakers (40%). \n\nAlso PewDiePie's insane growth continued long after he made his final move to the UK, which was around the time MatPat released his video, so you can't blame the guy for not realizing the insane growth was not related to the phenomena when he didn't have the opportunity to see it wasn't.\n\nThe thing is that even after PewDiePie got to #1, he continue to grow insanely fast, long after any effect moving might have had was long gone.\n\nEven when you you convert his growth rate to being proportional to his subscriber count, he was still growing faster proportional than most of the people at the top.\n\nYou can make the case that because PewDiePie was number 1 he received more attention, but that effect was never that big when other people were at the top. \n\n2014 was pewdiepie's best year, where he reached his peak in subs gained per month and views per month, and he has been in decline ever since. 2014 was also almost everybody else in the top 20's peak year.\n\nBy [December 2014](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LpviIaXpPeqN8jZjf7Jm0g.png) everyone had slowed down, but PewDiePie was still growing fast in comparison, just slow compared to before. His insane lead is the result of that. \n\n\nThis is my alternative hypothesis. \n\nPewdiepie was a gaming youtuber during the time Gaming was becoming really popular on youtube, and for whatever reason he was the most popular. Its difficult to guess why but I think its because kids really liked him, and his fan base decided to spread him around. During that time in Youtube's history I remember people complaining a lot about PewDiePie's fans. \n\nThe reasons gaming became popular is in part because of what matpat explained. Someone had to be #1 gamer and it just so happened to be PewDiePie. Someone also just so happened to be #1 Spanish Language Youtuber, and it happened to be HolaSoyGerman.\n\nThe thing I think is most important to consider is both of their rises happened at a time *everyone was growing insanely fast*, meaning them growing faster in comparison meant they were growing at ludicrous speed. \n\nEveryone growing insanely fast in 2013 could be the result of many more people using Youtube, which may have been the case with HolaSoyGerman since latin american countries have had their internet use growing rapidly recently, [you can watch this video I made which explains the Spanish languages rise](https://youtu.be/hfDHkH8QZbQ) but in the English speaking world internet use has been comparatively flat. \n\nThe second way is that Youtube changed something that made subscribing to channels more common. So instead of their being more users, each user was subscribing to more channels. I think this is the most likely case to explain the difference between 2012 and 2013.\n\nSome algorithm change made subscribing more common for everyone.\n\nWhat this means is that pre-2013 subscribers numbers were more \"real\" as in they accurately reflected how many people wanted to be notified of your videos, while after 2013 subscriber numbers were inflated with people who might only be partially interested since they are subscribed to hundreds of channels thanks to Youtube making subscribing more common.\n\nI think 2013 was the time in between when all the users were increasing their subscribed channels from the \"real\" amount they were highly interested in watching, to the \"inflated\" number they were partially interested, so by 2014 most people who were going to subscribe to the big channels already had. \n\nAnother possible explanation for the sudden drop off in mid-2014 for everyone is YouTube changed something again which made subscribing to big channels less common. \n\nEither way PewDiePie's and HolaSoyGerman's rise coincided with a time when subscriber numbers were growing wildly, so once they took their respective places at the top, their numbers were a lot higher in comparison to everyone else than they would have been if the pre-2013 algorithms were in place. \n\nA lot of the problems we are now seeing with Youtube channels having such low view counts in comparison to their sub count might be the result of the 2013 Boom coming to a Bust. For 3 years people have been subscribing to channels they don't really want to watch all the time. Essentially they treated the subscribe button as something unimportant, and Youtube encouraged them by making it far less important such as removing the sub feed from the home page. \n\nWhat I think is happening now is Youtube realizes this is a problem and is trying to solve it very poorly by doing subscriber purges in a haphazard way.\n\nThanks for listening to my long rant on an incredibly niche topic. It just bothers me that people are repeating something from MatPat's video that I know to be wrong. I actually have a lot of respect for the beginning of MatPat's video and I often recommended people watch it, but PewDiePie's rise can't be explained by moving to Italy because Italy is not important to Youtube, and can't be explained by being from Sweden because lots of people were from Sweden. \n\n**tl;dr MatPat was wrong. The first half of the video is okay, but the second half is inaccurate**\n\n ", "id": "dapverp"}, {"comment": "That was a cool read! And it actually explained all of my questions about where all the Spanish language youtubers came from.", "id": "dapwakt"}, {"comment": "The process of figuring out why Spanish Youtubers were doing so well right now is actually what led me to finally realize that MatPat's video was inaccurate. \n\nIt was a bit shocking since I loved MatPat's meta theories and its what influenced me to try to figure out other phenomena, that very video where MatPat \"explained\" PewDiePie's rise was actually the first time I ever heard of PewDiePie, which goes to show how easily people can fly under the radar with Youtube.  \n\nHowever I completely understand why MatPat thought that was the case given what he would have known at the time. However I think matpat's flaw was looking at PewDiePie and trying to figure out why he did so well. If you look at something hard enough you'll eventually start seeing patterns where their isn't really anything (which is a general flaw it matpat's content but that comes with the territory of doing fan theories)\n\nWith the Spanish language youtubers I also looked at other languages like Portuguese (#3), French(#4), Russian(#5 but close to French), and German (#6), as well as languages that had lots of speakers like Arabic, Bengali, and Hindi, which had lots of speakers but not many channels. I ended up creating a rudimentary model for how popular you would expect a language to be on Youtube\n\nBengali and Hindi are from Bangladesh and India, which still have very low internet access, but it is growing, so their lack of channels was predicted.(India has a lot of music channels but I didn't consider music since music on youtube is extremely different than the rest)\n\nArabic is one language that should have been higher than it was. There are some channels with 1 million subscribers, but based on number of speakers and internet access, it should have been closer to Portuguese. (Egypt has medium internet access and has the most speakers, Saudi Arabia and other gulf states have high internet access but lower populations, and there are lots of Arabic speaking countries with really low internet access, so it would be a lower than Portuguese, where Brazil has medium internet access and most of the speakers)\n\nHowever some people who actually know about the arabic language as a language instead of just a bunch of numbers told me that regional variations of Arabic were very different than one another, so that might explain why the channels are smaller. \n\nBy model also explained why Russian and French were about the same size despite their being many more Russian speakers. France, Canada, Belgium, and Switzerland all have high internet access, while Russia has medium internet access. This was encouraging since the model was not made with Russian and French in mind.\n\nThe model did fail to predict why German was lower than French. German has more native speakers, but when we count second language speakers the two are fairly equal. The model would predict French to only be slightly higher than German, since I gave native speakers higher weights than second language speakers. \n\nHowever talking to some German speakers, they've told me that German Youtube is pretty shitty, and its seems like all the good channels run by Germans are in English, like Kurzgesagt. This might be because of Germany's and Austria's high English proficiency, meaning the most educated probably all speak english. \n\nAs such I adapted my model to account for countries with high English proficiency to under preform due to English preference. Therefore my model predicts that when India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh get higher internet access all of their languages will under preform due to the most educated all speaking English.

They can get consistently more views by promoting controversial or click bait videos to the front feeds. Sure pewdiepie has a massive following and a lot of people love his videos, but they can get more views off of 20 random videos with click bait titles than a month of pewdiepie videos.\n\nIt's the same reason you go on Facebook and don't see your friends' posts anymore. All you see are promoted ads and videos from unreliable news sources. They don't care, people will still be engaged with the sites and the revenue streams will come in.

Woman/cap woman conversation is probably: \"you leaving? can we get your spot, been waiting a while\" \"sure, drive around, its yours\". A kind of promise. Next comes bike boy and silver car. Still no sign of blue car people having noticed OP. \n\nOnly when OP creeps closer and bike boy blocks and does the stop hand thing (which, guilt and wrongness issues aside, is audacious of bike boy) does cap woman get out and notice OP and probably think OP is cutting in line. Mistake, but innocent mistake. \n\nIn addition cap woman likely feels she's made a promise already. Sounds like she says \"they've waited\" or something like that to OP. Sure she doesn't own the spot, but it is embarrassing to have to renege on the promise she just made, while unaware of OP's premier position in line, and humans tend to want to avoid embarrassment.\n\nThere might be a silver lining for OP though. Contact Larry David and sell the whole situation as a manuscript for the upcoming season of Curb Your Enthusiasm. Episode title \"bike boy\". Everyone (but Larry D) wins! In fact comments below mine could probably crowdwrite together the whole episode. Larry will look a long time for his spot.

Neither blue car people nor the woman show any signs of having seen OP by then. Woman/cap woman conversation is probably: \"you leaving? can we get your spot, been waiting a while\" \"sure, drive around, its yours\". A kind of promise. Next comes bike boy and silver car. Still no sign of blue car people having noticed OP. \n\nOnly when OP creeps closer and bike boy blocks and does the stop hand thing (which, guilt and wrongness issues aside, is audacious of bike boy) does cap woman get out and notice OP and probably think OP is cutting in line. Mistake, but innocent mistake. \n\nIn addition cap woman likely feels she's made a promise already. Sounds like she says \"they've waited\" or something like that to OP. Sure she doesn't own the spot, but it is embarrassing to have to renege on the promise she just made, while unaware of OP's premier position in line, and humans tend to want to avoid embarrassment.\n\nThere might be a silver lining for OP though.

These crystals melting/vaporizing into smoke and being inhaled is one of the main things that actually gets you high.\n\nNow that you understand that imagine if you could somehow remove most of the actual plant matter and just knock only the trichomes off of the plant to be smoked.  This is basically the idea behind keif/hash. Finally,  if you now imagine you knocked/soaked them off chemically so it avoided virtually all extra plant matter and then dissolved away the chemical so that the only thing left was essentially melted/gooey pure THC, that is basically what a dab is (there is actually some other elements/cannabinoids besides JUST THC involved but the general concept of a more pure refined package is the idea behind it.) \n\nWhen you smoke a dab you scoop up a small amount of the goo onto a glass piece designed for it and head up a metal bowl with a blowtorch or similar.  When the bowl is heated you use the stick to swirl the ball against the edges while you inhale as it instantly vaporizes.\n\nThe average THC content of some very potent weed is maybe 15-20% on the high end (if you are in a state where you can purchase legally you will find somewhere more towards 20-30%), a dab is something like 60-90% THC (thanks to people who corrected my original #'s) depending on the form, so it's essentially a supercharged single hit that sends you 0-100 instantly.\n\n-edit- Sorry if this sounds a bit patronizing I completely misread your post as though you didn't smoke pot and didn't know the basics of it, this is still helpful I feel like for anyone who doesn't understand it though just don't want you to think I was being an asshole in the way I wrote it\n\nAlso thanks to multiple people below me who also have posted more good information or corrected some things I said, I was a bit overexaggerated in my original 99% THC estimate and had a few other things pointed out I tried to correct", "id": "daprkly"}, {"comment": "well that helped me, thanks", "id": "daps5f4"}, {"comment": "Same.

You can also use it in something comparable to ecigs basically with a vape pen style also.\n\nThe way an oil rig works is essentially you have a straight up and down piece of glass or metal called a \"nail\" which you put a bit of your product on, you then have another piece which sort of forms a cap over the tip of the nail as well as a bubble around the entire thing so that it is enclosed.  What you do is heat up the cover piece, then put it on top of the nail so it vaporizes it and the bubble channels all the vapor through the water.  [It's hard to describe but a picture makes it way easier to understand, the thing on the left is the nail that you would put the stuff on and then the dome on the right would go over it.

Depending on the quality of the extract and what processes is has gone though there are also impurities like plant waxes and fats.\n\nThe other cannabinoids and the terpenoids give each strain its own properties and those properties can remain in an extract depending on how it was done, and sometimes terpenoids are even added back in afterwards. \n\nTHC is just one of the important chemicals in weed.

Coughing can cause vasovagal syncope, which basically means \"heart and blood pressure get confused and you pass out briefly\". This is in this case due to coughing without a sufficient \"breather\" so that intrathoracic (chest cavity) pressure increases, making it hard for venous blood to flow in. This causes the heart to race in order to keep the blood pressure up as there is now from the heart's point of view less \"water in the pipes\". Then the coughing stops, the blood glugs back in, the heart says \"oh I don't need to race\" and abruptly slows down too much, so you get briefly lower blood flow from your heart overcompensating in the slow direction, your brain gets less blood and thus oxygen transiently as a result, and you hit the floor for a minute.\n\n\nOr it coulda just been an atomic dab.\n\n\n\nEdit:  Could've been a heart rhythm change induced by the dab or coughing too.

Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Make sure the top three cards of the deck are 4, 4, Ace. (*Edit*: Or just memorize the third card from the top.)\n2. Shuffle the deck in a way that doesn't affect those cards. (*Edit*: Look how Chris does it, it's easy.)\n3. Divide the cards into three piles, place them on the table and make sure to place the top pile into the middle.\n4. Take one card (a 4) from the center pile and place it face-up on the left one.\n5. Take another card (another 4) and place it on the pile on the right.\n6. Get the volunteer to draw the top card from the center pile (the Ace) and let him mix all the cards back together any way he likes. (Placing the two fours is just for show and not required.)\n7. Go through the cards and pick out the Ace you previously made your volunteer draw. Place it at the fourth position from the bottom of the deck.\n8. Show the bottom card of the deck to the audience by lifting up the deck.\n9. It isn't the correct card, so pull it out from under the deck and place it face-down on the table.\n10. Move one card from the bottom of the stack to the top without showing it to anyone.\n11. Show the next card in the exact same fashion as before.\n12. This time, you don't actually place the bottom card onto the table, even though you make it look like you do. Instead you take the very next card which is easy if you slightly shift back the bottom card with your index finger.\n13. \"Burn\" another card. (This is important since you don't want to show the same card twice.)\n14. Show two more cards and put them on top of the ones on the table.\n15. Pick the small stack on the table up and show the bottom card to the audience again.\n16. It isn't the correct card of course, so you seemingly put it back on the table.

It blinds their objectivity and they paint the rebels as freedom fighters liberating the country from an evil dictator. However, anyone familiar with the history of the region and makeup of the rebel groups would realize that 1. Assad is the same as every other ruler in the Middle East, authoritarian regimes are the only way things run somewhat smoothly there 2. The disorganized and questionably motived rebels are in no position to replace him. To clarify my problem is not that they are reporting in the rebels but the manner in which they do so.\n\nVice's coverage of Ukraine was even worse from a journalistic standpoint. They got some frontline footage of combat in the East, and described the situation there fairly well, noting the covert Russian presence and conditions for civilians. But later on in their story they went to Poland to cover NATO training in an effort to portray that NATO forces were preparing in the event of a Russian invasion. The Vice reporters pressed military officials to deliver that desired response but based on the fact that the training was part of a routine annual exercise that has been going on for years the officials did not confirm the claims and the reporter left it open ended.\n\nThis is what annoys me so much about Vice, they are tremendous in choosing what to cover and really getting into the heart of a story but then they go and force feed you opinions and unsubstantiated speculation which ruins it.\n\n- I subscribe to a variety of sources currently, but mainly I get my international news from BBC and for national news the Wall Street Journal.", "id": "daqp196"}, {"comment": "That's fair with regards to their coverage of Syria.

I unfortunately didn't follow the story into Poland. \n\nI agree that Vice makes excellent choices wrt to topics. The quality of their reporting, I find, depends on the journalist. This might be because they do offer a lot of freelance work, which results in some unevenness, but they still do employ some very good and pretty bold authors full-time.

When at low energies, like at room temperature, there is a magnetic field around the magnet due to the alignment of all the magnetic moments of the atoms.

If you understand what he's trying to say, he's actually making a lot of sense.\n\n> \"What does music have to do with technology? You sing songs. ... Mozart played the piano, but his songs sold pianos.\"\n\nMusic drives innovation in technology through publicity. Popular musicians spur sales of whatever instrument(s) they play. Introduce a new instrument and expect the same outcome. See: Theramin, and other weird instruments.\n\n> \"I don't understand the complex between Republicans, Democrats, and Congress. Like...that whole dance...to me just turns me off.\"\n\nPolitics, especially the intricacies of the two-party system and Congress, are boring to him. Things like crony-ism, the revolving door of lobbyists, filibustering, etc, are just not things he wants to spend his time dealing with.\n\n> \"Apple has more money than American government has liquid! And you tellin' me kids ain't learnin' iOS in freakin' 3rd Period? That don't make any sense!\"\n\nHe's right on the money on this one. Kids should be learning computer skills at a young age to help advance our economy into the foreseeable future. Learning how to operate and navigate, and further, within these extremely popular and profitable computer systems is a very big deal and we should adjust our curriculum accordingly.\n\nIf kids knew how to build software applications by 6th grade, they'd be able to make up for those lost manufacturing jobs and become entrepreneurs or work for software companies almost anywhere. We're supposed to prepare them for the future.\n\n>\"Gramophones. It first was *Gram-o-phone*. ... [And] that gramophone is now our Grammy Award. And we went from selling gramophones, and music  being played on gramophones, to music being played in iPhones...and now we have iTunes.\"\n\nTechnology has really come a long way. Past methods of technology are now just remnants of their former selves.\n\n>\"We're gonna say when I'm 60 years old, I'm gonna tell my little grandson, 'I remember when a window was just a window! We used to look out the window.' You never know what a window is gonna be until you marry art and science for *this* era.\"\n\nAgain, hit the nail on the head. Take a time machine back a century and ask someone what a car is. Their answer is very different from today. Sure, they're fundamentally the same. But the standards and best practices have made leaps and bounds in the span of time between. What was a window then and now has definitely changed. What was once strictly a hole in a wall for looking through is now also the virtual surface on which you're reading this message. In 50 years, how will it and other concepts change?\n\n> \"So I watched this movie called Waiting for Superman. I'm like, 'Wow, that's really sad,' but the sad thing is the title, not what's *happening*. It's the fact that they're waiting for *Superman*.\"\n\nThe title of the movie \"Waiting for Superman\" is depressing because instead of standing up for each other and saving themselves, they're waiting for a hero to do it for them. This is the bystander effect. Many of you have seen how horrific it can be, waiting around for someone else to take charge, never heeding the call to action or taking responsibility, even when the situation is dire.\n\n> \"That's terrorism...if we have a society where there is no education reform 'cause we'll be...It's terrifying what's gonna happen fifteen years from now when [...] artificial intelligence [increases] and group intelligence [decreases]. That's terrifying. ... And it's a national security issue, and a human's right[s] issue...actually.\n\nAnother example of him having a hard time putting thoughts to words. Computer programs are replacing human intelligence at alarming rates. While we are constructing the tools to make our lives easier, we're not utilizing that extra time and effort saved on educating ourselves or our society as a whole. Our education system is a horrible mess and people are getting dumber and becoming less and less equipped to deal with the world set before them.\n\nIt's a national security issue because we need smart people defending our country against a whole range of threats, including but not limited to cyber terrorism.\n\nIt's a human's rights issue because actively degrading the education of, or neglecting *to* educate, our youth is irresponsible and can be interpreted as grooming them for subservience and poverty. The idea here is that we all have a *right* to a decent education. That's not radical thinking.\n\nHim likening it to \"terrorism\" is likely hyperbolic, however intentional or unintentional, but the imagery certainly fits when you consider terrorist groups like ISIS actively eroding education and you consider why they might do that.\n\n#tl;dr It's not bullshit, he just sucks at public speaking."], [28, "I have a theory about the relationship between creativity and ridiculous political theories. \n\n[Here's a youtube video on a neuroscientist talking about creativity and the brain](https://youtu.be/4anaU6rdU1Q?t=43s)\n\n>So for example I think a really big part of what it means to be a genius is to have a great deal of creative or, like, novel thinking. Making these novel associations between ideas. Having a lot of pattern detection. **So it's not just about collecting a bunch of data an knowing a lot of facts but it's making these novel connections between ideas**.\n\n*For the record I'm not saying Will.i.am is a genius so just follow this line of thinking to the end before you downvote me in anger.*  \n\nWill.i.am has become good at indulging the second part of that equation, making novel connections between ideas. The knowledge and data part is his knowledge of music theory, history, and genre (and ultimately what gets people dancing). He's become famous and rich because he's particularly good at connecting music genres we know and love (rock, hip hop, funk, jazz etc.) and pumping out catchy combinations that are new and exciting to the average person (we're talking pop music here which is fine and perfectly admirable as a skill). \n\nThe problem is when he applies that strong ability to connect disparate ideas in terms of subjects with which he has low information or knowledge about as it can lead to some nonsensical conclusions. He lets his mind just make random and weird associations that most people can easily tell is full of shit. But it's important to remember that those nonsensical connections can have value. It's a big reason a lot of the worlds most prolific creative types were heavy hallucinogenic drug users. They were seeing shit people shouldn't be seeing and able to translate that into meaningful information for the rest of our \"non-drug-addled\" brains.\n\nAll that to say that I believe that creativity is more of a skill than people tend to think it is. Yeah you can be born with more ability in it than others, but being able to make novel and unique connections is something you can practice and learn. You may not be the next great philosopher but you can greatly improve your creative thinking if you try letting your mind run wild sometimes. \n\nJust something to keep in mind for yourself and, perhaps, to inspire a little sympathy when you see someone like Will.i.am making a complete fool of themselves. For every 1000 dumb will.i.am idea he comes up with, he spits out 1 really great one, and that's pretty much how we move human culture and knowledge forward. 1 diamond sifted out of a mountain of shit at a time.\n\nTLDR: Creativity is all about making weird connections between ideas and thoughts. Do more of it in your daily life but be mindful that it can make you look like an ass sometimes.

I don't think it's a good idea to teach kids that computer science is where it's at for the future of their careers. And I say that as a software developer. Kids should be taught to do what they want to do. Be a Doctor, Nurse, Lawyer, Builder, Mechanic.. and Software Engineer.. if that's what interests them. But this \"the future is in apps\" mind set is dangerous imho because we don't know how long apps are going to be around. In 15 years we may not even be using apps in the way we use them today. Technology is simply too unpredictable. And if the software development job market is flooded with all of these school leavers.. they're not going to find jobs. Because as strange as it sounds.. that market is shrinking. It's becoming easier to develop with fewer overheads, fewer staff and a lot of development is being done overseas in places like India.\n\nIn short.. teach kids CS.

Making these novel associations between ideas. Having a lot of pattern detection. **So it's not just about collecting a bunch of data an knowing a lot of facts but it's making these novel connections between ideas**.\n\n*For the record I'm not saying Will.i.am is a genius so just follow this line of thinking to the end before you downvote me in anger.*  \n\nWill.i.am has become good at indulging the second part of that equation, making novel connections between ideas. The knowledge and data part is his knowledge of music theory, history, and genre (and ultimately what gets people dancing). He's become famous and rich because he's particularly good at connecting music genres we know and love (rock, hip hop, funk, jazz etc.) and pumping out catchy combinations that are new and exciting to the average person (we're talking pop music here which is fine and perfectly admirable as a skill). \n\nThe problem is when he applies that strong ability to connect disparate ideas in terms of subjects with which he has low information or knowledge about as it can lead to some nonsensical conclusions. He lets his mind just make random and weird associations that most people can easily tell is full of shit. But it's important to remember that those nonsensical connections can have value. It's a big reason a lot of the worlds most prolific creative types were heavy hallucinogenic drug users. They were seeing shit people shouldn't be seeing and able to translate that into meaningful information for the rest of our \"non-drug-addled\" brains.\n\nAll that to say that I believe that creativity is more of a skill than people tend to think it is. Yeah you can be born with more ability in it than others, but being able to make novel and unique connections is something you can practice and learn. You may not be the next great philosopher but you can greatly improve your creative thinking if you try letting your mind run wild sometimes. \n\nJust something to keep in mind for yourself and, perhaps, to inspire a little sympathy when you see someone like Will.i.am making a complete fool of themselves. For every 1000 dumb will.i.am idea he comes up with, he spits out 1 really great one, and that's pretty much how we move human culture and knowledge forward. 1 diamond sifted out of a mountain of shit at a time.\n\nTLDR: Creativity is all about making weird connections between ideas and thoughts.

It might not seem like it makes sense, but it makes exactly as much sense as getting charged with Resisting Arrest with no reason to have been arrested in the first place.\n\nTo answer your first question, it's a combination of all of those. Some environmentalists I know are concerned completely with the water aspect. Pipelines break. Devils Advocate \"Yeah, but not often!\" The more pipelines the more breaks. After they break, [the corporations aren't held responsible for cleaning them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSBSLkQAkb8), and this is only one of hundreds of ways the government and the big corporations are crooks together. \n\nFor me, the issue here is governmental protection for private businesses. There are obviously inappropriate relationships happening between government and corporations when a) Mainstream news ignores a thousands-strong, police-involved protest; b) Police are accusing protesters of a variety of violent actions with no hard evidence and no arrests to back them up; c) Militarized police units from around the country have been called to reinforce a very peaceful protest.\n\nComparing this to the bird sanctuary assholes makes all the above things clear. Those guys did more damage in a shorter amount of time, and were blatantly threatening violence at the intervention of any outside forces. Police sat back and watched them destroy shit while government workers stationed there couldn't work. Then none of those guys were convicted of anything. This shows that police only open fire on unarmed protesters. *This* means that their main purpose is *not* to maintain peace, but to tenderize peaceful people for easier disbursement, while showing respect to armed militias. \n\nThe answer to violent, aggressive, armed police opening fire should be immediate retaliatory fire. If non-violent civilians are being injured by police, police should be dead. That's what the 2nd Amendment ensured us as citizens of this country. The government, nor its agents, has the right to seriously injure us and threaten us with lethal force. That is the exact time our founding fathers would have, themselves, taken up arms against this fouled and decrepit corporate-run institution that is our government.", "id": "dar9zau"}, {"comment": "Again, I'm probably a pessimist to a fault. \n\nOf course the government favors the oil company and the pipeline rather than the native Americans.

Of course the police are militarized, of course they treat civilians like they're second class, and of course nothing is going to change. Our president elect is fucking Donald Trump, and it could have been Hilary. That should be proof enough that \"the people\" have no fucking power. \n\nThe 2nd Amendment is a joke.

I had to increase the volume and pressure, develop tone and increase the sustain sound. And hoping to express the sound of gayageum more diversely like that of the guitar, I had to study guitar effectors and amplifiers and test them to see if they would fit to the sound of the gayageum. Playing modern music on a traditional instrument was not an easy process. I have come a long way from the beginning but still have a long way to go! \n\n> I have been funding my musical career with my own money but I sometimes wonder if I would have made more significant progress if I had more time and financial support.

And if anyone ever was doing that they too would also get in shit just as much as anyone else... Because it's pedophilia.

She could have held their hand or acted as a family member, walked off and likely nobody would have done a thing. This wasn't even a bathroom.

So this bathroom argument makes just about as much sense.\n\nLetting trans people use washrooms isn't making it any harder or easier for pedophiles.

Peeping in the cracks of the stall to see little girl coochi. \n\nThat's not what happened in this case but that wasn't my point. \n\nIt won't stop pedos from just going in anyway but it makes it harder and socially unacceptable to be in there. ", "id": "daqz7jd"}, {"comment": "Right out of the gate you're resorting to name-calling, slurs and insults. Nice.\n\nDo you not understand that these pedophiles, if they want to, can already go in to bathrooms whether or not it's legal?  And likely nobody would do a fucking thing because they could easy disguise themselves or simply go in a different bathroom. Or do what this person did and go online and stand in a mall and have nobody be the wiser... What this woman did is less risky even if the damn bathroom situation was legal. They don't care about whether or not the bathroom rights are put in or not if they're pedophiles and their main goal is to have sex with a child. Even if it was easier for them to enter the bathrooms and pose as trans people do you think they'd choose the bathroom option when people like this lady pulled shit like this with no heat? \n\nAnd where is this fear of pedophilia in public bathrooms suddenly coming from? Is this some common thing that happens that I don't know about? And a pedophile, with these rights in place or not, can easily already go in a bathroom and try shit if they wanted to... How would enacting these rights at all make it ANY easier?\n\nMost trans people who \"don't pass\" can't safely enter bathrooms and laws/bills aren't going to magically fix that... But the bill is for those people. The people who don't pass. The people who do pass as their gender won't ever be questioned or bullied going to the bathroom, law or not. So I highly doubt a pedophile is going to take the route with the most potential heat and way to draw attention... And if the pedophile *does* pass as the gender of the bathroom they want to go in to then you wouldn't question them walking in anyways regardless of if the law was passed or not.\n\nThe bathroom rights for trans people won't make it suddenly easier for pedophiles to come in and abuse children.

It's that way now for anyone who passes, pedophiles included. If they don't pass then they'd already be drawing heat the second they walk in just for being there and, in some cases, have the shit kicked out of them just for being in there in the first place.

This is a pipeline burst several feet below the surface and directly rising through the soil and water to the air. Although solubility of gases (including methane, or \"natural gas\") increases with cold temperature (since it is winter), there's no \"trap\" to keep the gas from escape to lower pressures (the atmosphere). If you increase the pressure, the solubility will increase, and that is how methane gets into drinking water naturally - that is, water aquifers can be at higher pressures underground and, if there is methane present, the gases can dissolve into the liquid. And even if there was methane in your drinking water, by the time it go to your faucet it would degas long before its concentration would be dangerous to your health. If anything, and this is a super extreme and rare thing, the threat of dissolved methane would be a buildup of it after degassing into a confined space.\n\nThe real issue is its release into the atmosphere. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. There's enough of it in the atmosphere from natural sources that adding more from these kinds of accidents is becoming a big concern. Further, methane (CH4) reacts with oxygen (O2) to break down into water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), both of which are also greenhouse gases.\n\nSo don't believe people like u/aerik - they don't know what they're talking about.", "id": "daqpbxx"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the informed reply", "id": "daqqjsc"}, {"comment": "Not really, hydrocarbons have very low solubility in water (non-polar v polar).

Air is evacuated into the theaters' central air intake as normal to stimulate sales.\n\nAfter conditions are met and the bottom plate energized to begin the popping in unison, the chamber begins popping the corn.  The next chambered area now is being evacuated of air and the pump stays operational as it plays \"Round Robin\" across the vacuum corn cookers.\n\nAfter the calculated time exposure to the heat inside the cooker, a steel mesh lifts up from the oil separating the fluffy food from the little bit of oil remaining to be used on the batches after. (Oil and butter are added each time to maintain a target level) The popping vessel then fills with some air from another vessel nearby in preparation to save initial air evacuating energy costs.  That vessel is then vacuumed out as the now finished one takes in the other half as normal.  (Daisy chained vacuums simply topped off once the system is in full swing)\n\nThe chamber now with atmospheric pressure opens in the center leaving the remaining oil reservoir in the half pot at the base; this is all far below the now elevated metal mesh that has risen to the seams level at the center of the vacuum chamber.\n\nWith a slight tilt and a quick agitating vibrating hum, the top half opens on from the bottom hinged on the side like a German Octoberfest beer stein (except lower).  Our space corn now tumbles down clear channels into the funneled opening (chute) overtop the POS reservoir.    \n\nAdd some LED's to sell the sequenced pressure cookers each equally offset in a timed popcorn drop above.

Goal is to control the center with pawns backed up by \"stronger\" pieces like the queen and knights.\n\nMagnus responds with nc6, Nimzowitsch Defense (response to Bill's pawns to center opener). A hyper modern opener for black that is unorthodox for higher level play but it's Magnus. He can fuck around if he likes. Goal is to let white have center with his pawns and undermine the opponent's stronger pieces by moving around the sides and distracting so he can counter with his own pawns. Long story short, Magnus was fucking with Bill out the gate.\n\nBill moves nf3. Still pretty standard for white when there's no attack on his pawns. Attacking the center while positioning to protect further pawn movements (d4 for bill). Personally would have moved g3 but I'm partial to fianchetto strategies (Catalan opener or Queen's Gambits).\n\nMagnus d5. Attacking the center with his own pawn. Pretty sure this was just Magnus seeing how aware Bill was about the board. If he doesn't protect the pawn or the knight in his next move, then he's unaware. If he protects his pawn by moving nc3 that also attacks his own pawn, then he's somewhat aware of the board. If he moves bd3, then he's kind of aware but there was a better option. I will say that developing the bishop did open him up for castling, but it's just so... Apparent that he's going to castle now.\n\nMagnus nf6. Natural. Stacking the attack and protecting his own. Puts pressure on Bill and develops his own pieces.\n\nBill, xd5. Oh Bill... Better move would have been e5 to attack the knight, but nope.\n\nMagnus, Qxd5. Developed his queen and took out the kaniget. Will move soon to attack king side after castling.\n\nBill, nc3. Better late then never? Not that strong of a move now other than developing the knight and attacking the queen.\n\nMagnus, Qh5. Attacking king side and pinning Bill's knight to his queen. He could move Qc5 and attack the pawn next to the king at f2, but he knew that Bill's next move would be...\n\nKing side castle. Not a strong move. Bill has one deployed unit king side, but it's pinned to his queen compared to Magnus' queen, knight, and bishop. the rest of his pieces are too far away or trapped to do anything. Not to mention Magnus having stronger presence on the center, this move was a bad one. If only he had... I dunno another minute and a half to think it over?\n\nMagnus, Bg4. Further pinning the kaniget and making Bill scramble to protect it. Trying to run his knight off to attack at h2 which the knight is protecting.\n\nBill, h3. Would have been a strong move if his intention was to leave the pawn there instead of attack the bishop.\n\nMagnus, Ne5. Fantastic move. Protect his bishop and forks Bill's knight and bishop. Also, it's a vastly tempting move that is like saying \"Hey, Bill, take this piece with your knight or he might take your knight instead which would be bad. Really bad.\"\n\nBill, xg4. Other than the mate in two that this led to, it's a strong move. If Bill left his knight there at f3 then there's no mate in two.\n\nMagnus, Nxg4. Setting up the mate. Right now, Bill is fine unless he moves his knight that is protecting h2. Well, not fine, but comparatively okay.\n\nBill, Nxe5.

Haven't kept up with the currently popular chess moves but it's a pretty standard move for white. Goal is to control the center with pawns backed up by \"stronger\" pieces like the queen and knights.\n\nMagnus responds with nc6, Nimzowitsch Defense (response to Bill's pawns to center opener). A hyper modern opener for black that is unorthodox for higher level play but it's Magnus. He can fuck around if he likes. Goal is to let white have center with his pawns and undermine the opponent's stronger pieces by moving around the sides and distracting so he can counter with his own pawns. Long story short, Magnus was fucking with Bill out the gate.\n\nBill moves nf3. Still pretty standard for white when there's no attack on his pawns. Attacking the center while positioning to protect further pawn movements (d4 for bill). Personally would have moved g3 but I'm partial to fianchetto strategies (Catalan opener or Queen's Gambits).\n\nMagnus d5. Attacking the center with his own pawn. Pretty sure this was just Magnus seeing how aware Bill was about the board. If he doesn't protect the pawn or the knight in his next move, then he's unaware. If he protects his pawn by moving nc3 that also attacks his own pawn, then he's somewhat aware of the board. If he moves bd3, then he's kind of aware but there was a better option. I will say that developing the bishop did open him up for castling, but it's just so... Apparent that he's going to castle now.\n\nMagnus nf6. Natural. Stacking the attack and protecting his own. Puts pressure on Bill and develops his own pieces.\n\nBill, xd5. Oh Bill... Better move would have been e5 to attack the knight, but nope.\n\nMagnus, Qxd5. Developed his queen and took out the kaniget. Will move soon to attack king side after castling.\n\nBill, nc3. Better late then never? Not that strong of a move now other than developing the knight and attacking the queen.\n\nMagnus, Qh5. Attacking king side and pinning Bill's knight to his queen. He could move Qc5 and attack the pawn next to the king at f2, but he knew that Bill's next move would be...\n\nKing side castle. Not a strong move. Bill has one deployed unit king side, but it's pinned to his queen compared to Magnus' queen, knight, and bishop. the rest of his pieces are too far away or trapped to do anything. Not to mention Magnus having stronger presence on the center, this move was a bad one. If only he had... I dunno another minute and a half to think it over?\n\nMagnus, Bg4. Further pinning the kaniget and making Bill scramble to protect it. Trying to run his knight off to attack at h2 which the knight is protecting.\n\nBill, h3. Would have been a strong move if his intention was to leave the pawn there instead of attack the bishop.\n\nMagnus, Ne5. Fantastic move. Protect his bishop and forks Bill's knight and bishop. Also, it's a vastly tempting move that is like saying \"Hey, Bill, take this piece with your knight or he might take your knight instead which would be bad. Really bad.\"\n\nBill, xg4. Other than the mate in two that this led to, it's a strong move. If Bill left his knight there at f3 then there's no mate in two.\n\nMagnus, Nxg4. Setting up the mate. Right now, Bill is fine unless he moves his knight that is protecting h2. Well, not fine, but comparatively okay.\n\nBill, Nxe5.

For starters, if you banned slams, then there would be even *more* hugging than there already is - which is boring to watch and drags fights on longer than they need to. Then theres the side of, how exactly do you break up a koala hug if you can't slam the opponent? It is pretty much the only way, besides a ref stepping in.. so what, you want a ref to be stepping in to break up hugging every time one of the fighters gets puffed/rattled and goes in for a hug? \n\nI think its violent and dangerous, but fighters know not to hug like that and the ones that still do it are stupid and get what's coming.
