First off, Rose Kennedy didn't know that Joseph Kennedy had agreed to the procedure, so using this against her is pretty horrible in and of itself.  Secondly, it was recommended by doctors as an attempt to curb maladaptive behavior.  Only about 80 lobotomies had been performed in the US at the time so it was a pretty new procedure and clearly it didn't work the way they thought it would.  Thirdly, we're looking at it with a completely different societal concept of how to treat people with developmental disabilities.  Rosemary Kennedy had suffered oxygen deprivation during birth which led to brain damage.  She was cared for extremely well for the first 23 years of her life.  At a time when most developmentally disabled people were kept in state hospitals or asylums where they suffered massive amounts of neglect and abuse Rosemary Kennedy was being educated in a convent, with special teachers.  Rosemary wasn't hidden away and not talked about the way most upper class families would treat a disabled family member at that time.  Hell, she took part in her family's presentation in court in front of the King of England when Joe Kennedy was named ambassador.  So yes, it was horrible and it is very easy to score easy points shitting on the Kennedy's for their treatment of Rosemary because of this, but really, Rosemary Kennedy may have done more to help change the treatment of disabled people than anyone else.  After seeing what happened to Rosemary the Kennedy family not only started the special olympics but also Best Buddies.  Additionally Teddy Kennedy sponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act which was signed into law in 1990 as well as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, the Civil Rights Commission Act Amendments of 1978, which expanded the jurisdiction of the Civil Rights Commission to protect people from discrimination on the basis of disability, the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act, which enforced the rights of people in government institutions such as the elderly, the disabled, the mental ill, and the incarcerated under the Constitution.  Senator Kennedy also cosponsored legislation in 1984 requiring polling stations to provide physical accessibility for disabled and elderly people on federal election days, the Air Carrier Access Act which required that facilities and services be provided to people with disabilities traveling by air, and introduced the Fair Housing Act Amendments to extend the Fair Housing Act of 1968 to include people with disabilities and families with children.  The Kennedy family did a lot for disabled people, likely because they saw the way they were treated first hand and realized they had the power to effect change.", "id": "daqqvjo"}, {"comment": "I remember hearing this on TIL before and thought it would be relevant.

But it's fascinating. Thanks OP !", "id": "daoxlml"}, {"comment": "In layman terms (sorry I'm tired so I am typing this for fun): \n\nIn humans you share ~50% of your DNA with your parents and siblings. This is because each of your parents give you half their genes at random, so for each gene you have there is a 50% chance that one particular parent gave it to you. Similarly, for each gene you got there is a 50% chance your sibling got the same one. \n\nIn ants/bees, all females automatically get all of their father's genes (since the father only has half to begin with), so they automatically share at least 50% of their DNA with their siblings. For the remaining 50%, you got it all from your mom, but your sibling gets a different randomized set than you do. Using the same logic as the paragraph above, you and your sibling have a 50% chance of matching on each maternal gene, meaning 25% of your total material DNA should match. Add that to the identical set of paternal genes you both share, and that makes 75%. Meanwhile, you and your mom only share 50% genes.\n\nSummary of how much genes you share with...\n\n* Yourself: 100% (duh)\n* Sister: 75% (50% common for half from mom + 100% common for half from dad, or 1/2\\*50%+1/2\\*100%)\n* Mom: 50% (she gave you half your genes)\n\nThe key is to think that genes are \"selfish\" and want to persist, and the ones which propagate better are the ones that end up staying. You will notice that when a female has a daughter, she passes on only half her genes. But when her mother reproduces, a sister which shares 75% of your genes comes into existence. Having 75% of your genes in another member of your colony works out well for your genes getting propagated more, so as time goes on the genes which affect behavior to prioritize mother over self will dominate.\n\n**TL;DR**: While in humans you have self-preservation instincts to live long enough to pass on 50% of your genes to each children you produce, female ants would consider it a \"good deal\" to die in place of their mother since their mother producing more children via a longer life passes on 75% of your genes in each go.\n\nNote that male ants (drones) would therefore have different behavior and heavily prioritize mating themselves since they pass on 100% of their genes every time they give a female ant their sperm. It's an especially good deal since in many cases giving a female sperm means she will produce your children for the rest of her life.\n\n", "id": "daoycvp"}, {"comment": "You're my hero.

There is a conflict between the workers and the queen over the sex ratio of produced offspring. New males would be beneficial for the queen to produce because they still share 50% of the queens DNA and can then go on to help create new colonies. Same for females, but the best outcome for the queen would be to produce a male for every new queen. However the workers want to produce more females because they are more closely related to those individuals. \n\nRe: Brother's DNA\nNo, not so much. A brother and sister only share one link (the queen) and that link only conveys 25% similarity (daughter shares .5 with queen and queen shares .5 with son). You're tracing the link the wrong direction (son shares 1 with queen and queen shares .5 with daughter) giving 50% relatedness. The brother is 50% related to the female but the female is only 25% related to the brother. Which yes is very weird, but so is not having the same number of chromosomes. \n\nRe: word choice \nIt's not really the easier way, it's the more correct way. Selective pressure on a gene is not so much on whether the gene gives advantages to the individual that extend that individual's life but more on whether that gene gives advantages that increase that individual's fitness. \nIf a mutation happened in humans that caused the individual to die at age 5 but also caused the individual to be sexually mature at age 2 and able to come to full term in 1 month that gene would be heavily selected for because that individual's fitness would be so much greater than normal, even though their lifespan would be so much shorter. ", "id": "dappkqn"}, {"comment": "> genes would propagate faster through individuals who happen to decide to care for their mother\n\nThis is just a mathematical truth. If an individual possesses a gene which encourages faster/more efficient transfer of their own genes to more members in the population, over time that gene will show up more than other competing genes from outpacing. In this case, genes which slightly encourage helping the mother produce more offspring with the sperm reservoir they have from the original father's fertilization would result in slight outpacing for gene propagation and would eventually show up more than a slight gene variation which would encourage prioritizing one's own reproduction.\n\n> The brother is 50% related to the female but the female is only 25% related to the brother.\n\nI was thinking of this on the bus today and realized you are right. I fucked up the math. \n\nConcerning males being produced, I think they would be produced from unfertilized females? I am under the impression that since sperm persists so long inside a female, there are effectively two types of mothers who either produce only males or only females until either fertilization happens to the first or sperm runs out for second. That is to say, that within a given time frame if a female gave birth to daughters it is pretty certainly producing a daughter as the next offspring too.\n\n> If a mutation happened in humans that caused the individual to die at age 5 but also caused the individual to be sexually mature at age 2 and able to come to full term in 1 month that gene would be heavily selected for because that individual's fitness would be so much greater than normal, even though their lifespan would be so much shorter.\n\nThat's basically what I meant when I mentioned existence. In genetics you can effectively consider someone's lifespan just the time until they become infertile and someone's useful lifespan to be the total time where they are actually sexually mature. \n\nBut concerning the actual point I was making, this still isn't the genes being \"selfish\", just a statistical trend where more efficient reproduction results in higher rate of propagation of a particular gene. That was the point I wanted to get at.", "id": "daq7z5b"}, {"comment": "Gotcha. I understand the concept I just didn't understand your original wording, specifically \"genes would propagate faster through individuals\" would be more clearly stated, at least to me, as \"genes would propagate faster through a population\" because as you know individual's genes don't change. \n\n\nDon't worry, Hamilton did too.\n\n\nI didn't know how ant egg fertilization works so I googled it. It seems that all queens once in a colony already have their sperm reservoir as it was transferred during the \"nuptial flight\" thus there would be no period of being a non-fertilized queen that would be producing eggs. That said it seems like the queen can control the sperm reservoir and decide whether or not to fertilize each individual egg, and so can continue to create both males (unfertilized) and females (fertilized).\n\n\nI'm not sure how selection only caring whether the gene increases or decreases the fitness of the individual in order to continue passing on that gene can be called anything but selfish. It literally only cares about itself.", "id": "daq9pxf"}, {"comment": "I guess this is mostly a semantics game but...if there was a lush green forest with both green and red birds along with human hunters who shot down the red birds, eventually there would only green birds left. It doesn't make the green birds or their genes \"selfish\". Similarly, if there was a jar of jelly beans and I ate all of them except the black ones, the black jelly beans and their dye/flavoring aren't \"selfish\". In both cases, the group that survived through some population control factor simply did so because of favorable traits, not because they actually did anything or had any specific motive.\n\nSelection doesn't \"care\"; rather, it's an inevitability that better suited genes persist longer in a population. It's not out of \"selfishness\", but out of statistical advantages. The term \"selfish gene\" is wrong because it implies that genes promote fitness rather than that the situational criteria for fitness culls genes and makes others persist.\n\nI also wish to point out that though in many cases genes are selected based on fitness of individual, that is a mere coincidence since in most species a fit individual who can reproduce more will propagate their genes faster. In the case of ants and bees, it's more about the fitness of the colony, since through selection colonies where some members act as sacks of food while others provide defense while others gather food while others sit around popping out offspring turn out to be the best in terms of survival odds. Genes are just proteins representing randomized physical data which sometimes gets mutated through chance and don't \"care\" about fitness any more than jelly bean flavoring cares about the jelly bean.\n\nThrought experiment: We could hypothetically create a mini-society of eusocial humans by having an island of a ton of humans and immediately executing any individual who makes any action which detriments the group as a whole. If we did this indefinitely, you will see that the population would become eusocial. Similarly, if we made another mini-society where we killed every individual who took a certain level of risk for the sake of another, we would eventually get a society where humans are much more independent and apathetic and where babies are more self-sufficient and mature faster. Or maybe babies will be more mature at birth. Who knows. I would really curious to see this in practice.\n\nBased on the reproduction mechanics of ants and bees, it makes perfect sense that they become eusocial due to their sex determination system encouraging the individuals acting like pseudo-\"cells\" of a bigger organism.

More than likely, she paid around 25-30% EMTR based on national average statistics of the 1937-1944. \n\n(2)PP Loss/Gain is directly tied to the CPI so if you want to debate that $700 then is not $12,000 now because of ERISA and 125 loopholes, I guess yes, Hattie did not have the opportunity to contribute to a 401K so the rational has merit but not that it has impact on PP. I doubt or have never seen study that has claimed this, but please link.

Have a company by the executive a house, then the next day, forgive the loan. Buy an actress a jumbo jet, and then forgive the jet and the fuel and take the deduction.

Trans populations are very much at risk, as well. With African-American and Latino-American Trans people specifically in the highest infection rates. Furthermore, sexual health information and care is severely lacking for people within the LGBT community, and again specifically in regards to Trans people.\n\nWhether or not you are a supporter of the community, it takes a pretty cold hearted individual to think that ANYONE deserves to die of such a horrid disease, or that they deserved to contract it. And that's exactly what happened back then, and even still now, though less frequently.\n\nIf people are truly interested, they should look up various films about this. \"And Counting\" and \"Saint of 9/11\" are two films that talk about two different individuals who were connected to the crisis. One was someone who contracted it, and is still living. Sadly, the truth is for both subjects of the movies, the worst thing about being a member of the LGBT community was watching friends and lovers fading away and dying, sometimes while they themselves were finding out they were infected or dying. And to add insult to injury, they would often be unable to turn to family because being LGBT was still heavily stigmatized. And then, if you did become too sick to care for yourself, family would often be called in, and find out as your lying on your deathbed that you are gay etc. Then either they'd abandon you, or they'd fucking chastise you and abandon you. \n\nSorry, this is a subject that is very emotion-invoking for me.

Yes we do. Is gay marriage a hot topic? It is.

We did do prisoner testing in the past, and we ended up doing some pretty fucked up things as a result because of that exact line of reasoning. A pretty well known example is the Guatemala syphilis trials, where US researchers went to Guatemala (do to Guatemalan government cooperation and the ease of finding test subjects), and infected several vulnerable populations, such as prisoners, with stds including syphilis which at that time was untreatable.

It's ancient and it was probably used by the Aztecs, but that's not the same thing.\n\n> Known as Tlachihualtepetl (meaning \"man-made mountain\"), the origins of the pyramid are a little sketchy, though the general consensus is that it was built in around 300 BC\n\nBy using the more modern N\u00e1huatl (i.e., Aztec language) name for the pyramid, the authors continue to conflate this with an Aztec origin.\n\n> The ancient Aztecs most likely used the Great Pyramid of Cholula as a place of worship for around 1,000 years before moving to a new, smaller location nearby.\n\nNo, I don't think so.

", "id": "daq67py"}, {"comment": ">Winning the Battle of Britain would have won Germany the war.\n\nMaybe according to the History Channel, but that's like saying the Germans could beat the Soviets.\n\n\nThe Battle of Britain was an attritional fight, and you can't judge an attrition war without looking at both sides. On one side you had an air force that was losing experienced pilots, but had plenty of replacement fighters and pilots. On the OTHER you have an air force that was ALSO losing experienced pilots (and at an even greater rate) and ALSO lacked replacement planes and new pilots. By early September the Luftwaffe was very close to breaking. Kesselring was reaching the point where he could no longer escort multiple raids against defended airfields. In raw numbers, he had gone from a modest numerical edge in 109s in July, to having fewer serviceable fighters than Fighter Command in September! This bears repeating. By September of 1940 Dowding had 950 Spitfire and Hurricane pilots available, up from the 750 he had in July when the Battle started. Kesselring had 735 Bf 109 pilots operational by September, down from the 906 he had had in July. The Germans were clearly losing the war of attrition. Attacking London seemed to present both the chance of a strategic Hail Mary play, as well as making the job of Kesselring's overstretched fighter pilots much easier. They would now have just one big raid to cover, rather than lots of little ones.\n\nThe ever prescient Keith Park summed the situation up perfectly in a talk with the chief fighter controller of 11 Group. \"I know you and the other controllers must be getting worried about our losses. Well, I've been looking at these casualty figures, and I've come to the conclusion that at our present rate of losses we can just afford it. And I'm damned certain the Boche can't. If we can hang on as we're going I'm sure we'll win in the end.\" [Most Dangerous Enemy, p.301] Park repeated this optimism several times to his beleaguered squadron leaders, and at no time is there any indication he felt he was losing.\n\nHe was right.\n\nUnfortunately the argument that the British were losing due to a shortage of experienced pilots doesn't work. It's been the common wisdom of the Battle for decades, so there's plenty of sources to reference, but more recent scholarship by Overy and Bungay pokes the idea full of holes. By September of 1940 Fighter Command had plenty of planes and pilots - 200 more than it had had at the start of the Battle in fact (the \"deficit\" Deighton mentions is for Fighter Command's full establishment strength, which it had been 400 pilots short of when the Battle began) - what it lacked was experienced pilots, who had been suffering continual attrition for the past two months. Yes, that's bad, but what about the other side?\n\nFact is the Germans were also running out of experienced pilots, but on TOP of that, they were also running out of planes as well, and the trickle of recruits WASN'T replacing losses. New pilots were showing up at fighter squadrons with only 10 landings on the 109, and no live practice with the cannon. EGr 210 was receiving raw replacements out of flight school, which Goering's second, Erhard Milch, considered \"particularly aberrant\" given 210s elite role. The Bf 109 Gruppes with a paper strength of 35-40 planes were actually running 18 planes on average, with a serviceability rate of 75% due to shortages of spares. Worse, while Park was able to rotate out his squadrons the whole of the Jagdwaffe was continually engaged, and had been from the start. Its experienced pilots were running six or seven sorties a day, fighting an enemy who could appear at any time, usually from a position of advantage, and were faced with the continual danger of capture. The stress was literally starting to kill them.

NASA already does planetary science, and Earth is a pretty important planet to us.\n\nA fraction of NASA's budget currently goes towards [earth-observation and earth-science activities](https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science). NASA is uniquely positioned to build satellites and instruments that monitor ice, atmospheric composition, rainfall, soil composition, etc.  (i.e. if you are smart enough to build stuff to watch Mars, you already have the expertise needed to study Earth as well).  They even build plenty of monitoring instruments that go up on balloons and airplanes (you know the \"aeronautics\" part of the name).  Up until 2006 this WAS actually explicitly a part of the agency's mission statement just as much as manned spaceflight or robotic missions to other planets were.  As such, a portion of NASA's current budget is explicitly dedicated to these activities.\n\nThe problem is that the Republican administrations just want to strip this part of the mission statement + funding without replacing it for political reasons.  They'll give you some line about how some other agency like NOAA should be doing this research instead, whereas in reality NOAA is not going to get any of that money or personnel taken out of the NASA budget.  Furthermore, even if they did, it would be grossly inefficient.  Why have TWO separate agencies staffing / researching how to make similar planetary monitoring satellites / instruments with all of the bureaucratic overhead such parallel activities bring.\n\nTL;DR.

How long do you think it will take us to reach the nearest exoplanet orbiting the nearest star? Mars and Europa perhaps by century's end, but transporting the species out of our solar system is probably at the very least 100-200 years away.  No one really knows.

I mean, really, what percentage of our resources and innovation are allocated towards this goal? So without significantly more progress beyond the abysmal track record our species currently has on climate change (or a change in our economic model), climate issues will absolutely undercut this progress because climate is the existential crisis facing our modern society the remainder of *this* century, not the next, when it becomes a crisis for the species.  \n\nYou're right, we are currently watching the race between technology and mother nature, but given the historical record, my money is on mother nature if we fail to heed her warnings.

It's gotten to the point now where I can judge a distance almost instantly based on how large a guy appears in my scope. Fun fact: the dragonov sniper scope thing can be applied in other scopes, just measure there height in mili dots and convert to distance, then adjust your scope appropriately for the shot. Scopes vary so you'll have to find or work out the formula on your own, but you don't need to be very precise in a lot of games, within about 10-30 meters can usually still net you a hit if you're not >500 meters out.
