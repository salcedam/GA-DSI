The smell of the meat filled the grey interrogation room. A smell I had forgotten for so long.\n\n\"Eat it.\" commanded the investigator. He took out a fork and a knife from the bag and placed it beside the dish and pushed them toward me. I was puzzled. I imagined that hard silverware would be forbidden in an interrogation room. I stared into the black mirror behind the investigator, hoping there's someone who could explain what was going on. Was I under arrest? What for? And they bring steak for a detainee? Then, he placed whole bags of salt and pepper on the table. He even brought a bottle of steak sauce. How generous of him.\n\n\"I'm sorry... I'm a vegan. A strict one, at that.\" I said, as I pushed the dish and the silverware back to the investigator. I used to love meat when I was young. I'd throw tantrum if our Friday family dinner were vegetarian. Mom, meat! I'd scream. I probably didn't, but that's the general image of how much I loved meat. Then, this condition of psychometry hit me. Whenever I ate something, the vision of the final moment of what I ate flooded into me. I've seen cows with their brains knocked out. Chickens drowned dead in a cesspool. Pigs dragged to their slaughter house. I've heard the churning of the machines and the screams of the animals. Needless to say, they were mostly unappetizing. Even eating plants bothered me time to time. The noise of the industrial machine... at least they didn't make me want to puke on the table.\n\n\"Eat it.\" the investigator repeated.\n\n\"No, I'm very much certain that legal enforcement can't force me to eat something I refused to do so. And am I asking too much? I will eat, if it's not meat.\" I said. The cold, still, immobile eyes of the investigator fixated on my nervous face gave me an uneasy feeling. The investigator drew out a handgun from his side and slammed it on the steel table.\n\n\"Do I look like a cop to you?\" the investigator said in a low-pitched voice. Well, I was lead into an interrogation room in a huge building by a gun-and-badge-wielding officer, so of course the investigator looked like a police officer to me. But my impression of him being a part of legal enforcement vanished like a morning dew when he grabbed his gun and pointed it at my forehead.\n\n\"...No.\" I answered. I raised my both hands in the air while the investigator pushed the plate and the silverware back to me.\n\n\"Eat it.\" the investigator said, with his finger on the trigger. I nodded several times and reached for the silverware. I sliced a tiny piece from the corner of the steak and took a bite.\n\nThere was an animal screaming, as per usual. But it was that of human. A woman's, even. She was running through a corridor. The fluorescent light of the corridor was nearly blindly dazzling. The walls were blue and there were doors every several feet. The girl tried to open few of the doors, but all of them were locked. She looked behind, and there was a man with a machete. He swung it around and flailed the girl. She didn't die so fast. He hacked and mangled the girl until the body of the girl was a heap of bloodied meat.\n\nI jumped back in horror and leaned toward the wall behind me. Then, I vomited out the entirety of my stomach's content. The foul acidic stench drooled from my lips and the floor. I scratched my tongue to scrape off what my mouth had just touched: A human flesh. I looked back to the investigator. My feet was shaking and my collar was getting soaking wet from the sudden flash of sweats I had. But the investigator was not the murderer. I stuttered, \"wh... wh... shh... sh...\" I couldn't even make out a single word. \n\n\"Julia M. Hopp. She's 117th victim of the Machete Killer.\" the investigator said. \"We want you to help us find that son of bitch.\" We. Obviously we was not spoken as in royal we. There were more of them?\n\n\"I've read the psychiatric reports from your therapist... surely you do remember Mr. Randall from David Gibson hospital, do you not? And I've been told you possess a special skill which will aid us catch that motherfucker.\" He knew my condition very well and he abused it. It disgusted me at length he'd go to catch the murderer, but what offended me the most now was that he did it fully knowing what was going to happen to me. But, he was the guy with the gun in the scene.\n\n\"Can you describe to me what you saw?\"\n\nI, at the gunpoint, obliged. I described the corridor. Its color, its length, it's doors... I couldn't remember what type of floor was there, so I simply did not mentioned anything about it. The investigator was simply nodding to my description of the scene. Did he knew where the victim was murdered? Some help would have been appreciated. And then I went on to describe the murderer.\n\n\"Holy mother of god's shit. The Machete Killer was not masked? Not in a disguise of some sort? He just had his face out?\" The investigator nearly jumped and stood on his feet. I nodded. He turned his back on me, and started to call someone on his phone. Probably asking for a facial composite specialist, I figured. After he ended his phone call, he ran outside the room.\n\nAnd returned with a stack of papers, a roll of colored pencils, and more steaming meat on a plate. I had forgotten he wasn't a cop. Being locked inside an interrogation room gave such impression on me.\n\n\"I don't... know how to draw accurate portraits...\" I mumbled.\n\n\"That's why I brought more.\" the investigator said. Well, he was the man with the gun in his hand.\n\n "], [23, "\"You're kidding me.\"  Muller looked into the interrogation room with her arms crossed tightly in front of her, the glass window reflecting back her disbelieving frown.  \"You're really desperate enough to believe in this nonsense?\"\n\n\"Muller, it's not nonsense,\" Sully insisted, leaning forward slightly as he watched the man on the other side of the one-way mirror fidgeting uncomfortably.  \"Sympathetic visions are a real thing, and this could be our best lead on catching the Slaughterhouse Killer-\"\n\n\"It's disgusting and wrong, that's what it is,\" Muller insisted.  She turned and looked past Sully, at the other man in the room.  \"Senior Agent Hitchens, surely you can't be on board with this?\"\n\nSenior Agent Hitchens looked away uncomfortably, reaching up to run one hand through his short-cropped white hair.  \"It's unnatural, I give you that,\" he allowed.  \"But seein' as we're pretty much entirely out of leads at this point, I'm willing to entertain a little bit of unnatural voodoo if it gives me something for when I face the reporters.\"\n\n\"Yes, but this is-\" Muller started, but her words were interrupted by the arrival of a junior agent, carrying a plate with a silver cover set on top.\n\nSully moved to take the covered plate from the junior agent's hands.  \"Coming, Muller?\" he asked, as he headed for the door to the interrogation room.\n\nMuller sighed, but followed after her partner.  \"Even for you, this is a new low,\" she muttered, but she still came.\n\nInside the room, the young man looked up at their entrance.  \"Finally, someone's here,\" he said, blinking.  \"Can you explain what this is about?  Why I'm here?  Am I under arrest for something?\"\n\nMuller let Sully take the lead, instead sitting back on the other side of the table and examining the young man.  Late twenties, she guessed, a little too thin.  He didn't look malnourished, but she didn't see an ounce of excess fat anywhere on him.  He looked, she thought to herself with a little shiver, like someone who didn't enjoy the idea of eating.\n\nSully set the plate down on the middle of the table, not removing its covering.  \"Judah Matthias,\" he greeted the young man.  \"No, you're not under arrest.  You're here because of your ability.\"\n\nInstantly, Judah looked alert and wary.  \"I'm not sure what you're talking about,\" he began, but Sully held up a hand.\n\n\"It's okay,\" Muller's partner said, putting on his most reassuring smile.  \"I believe you.  And we think that you can help us.\"  The smile slipped a little as he sighed, glancing over his shoulder towards the mirrored glass behind him.  \"You may be the only one who can help us.\"\n\nJudah didn't yet look convinced, but he wasn't storming out on them.  Muller finally uncrossed her arms.  \"Can you tell us, in your words, about this ability that you have?\" she asked.\n\n\"They say that it's just a delusion, that it's not real,\" Judah answered her, his non-answer evasive.\n\nMuller sighed.  \"Humor me.\"\n\n\"Please,\" added Sully, his eyes big and sincere.\n\nSomething between the two agents seemed to push Judah over the edge.  \"Okay, okay,\" he gave in.  \"Look, it's been happening to me ever since I was a little kid.  My parents thought I was weird for only wanting to eat vegetables, but I couldn't explain it to them, couldn't tell them what happened.\"\n\n\"What happened when what?\" Muller asked.\n\nJudah sighed.  \"When I ate meat,\" he said.  \"Whenever I ate meat, I'd get this little... vision, I guess.  A flashback, a sudden memory.  One that wasn't mine.  I'd feel panic, pain, see this strange creature, hazy, coming towards me with some sort of gun in its hands, pointing it at my head, and then-\" He stopped, shuddering.  \"It wasn't until I got older that I realized that I was looking at the inside of a slaughterhouse.\"\n\n\"So when you eat meat...\" Muller pressed, wanting to hear the explicit confirmation.\n\nJudah grimaced at the words, but spoke them.  \"I see the last few seconds of the animal, yes.  Different details, but that final pain, that fear, is always the same.  I'm a very strict vegetarian, sworn off all meat now.\"\n\n\"Well, as much as it pains us to ask you to do this, we're afraid that we need you to break that vow,\" Sully said after a minute.  He tapped the covered dish in front of him.  \"You've heard of the Slaughterhouse Killer?\"\n\nJudah nodded, the wariness back in his eyes.\n\n\"Well, he's struck again,\" Sully confirmed.  \"Two young women, this time - at least, as best we can tell.  Once he's finished, the area's so destroyed that it's tough to even identify the age and gender of his victims.  We have no leads.  We thought that you might be able to help.\"\n\nJudah started to open his mouth, but Sully lifted the cover off of the plate, and the young man's jaw snapped shut.  Muller fought her own urge to wince away at the sight of the objects on the plate.\n\nTwo small spoons, each containing a single chunk of browned meat, barely the size of a pea.  \n\nJudah's eyes rose up to Sully and Muller, his expression fearfully disbelieving.  \"That's not - you don't want me to-\" he stammered out.\n\nSully nodded once, sadly.  \"I'm afraid so.  And we need you to tell us everything that you see.\"\n\nThe young man turned towards Muller, perhaps hoping that she'd confirm that this was all a big joke, but she nodded.  \"We don't have any other leads,\" she revealed.\n\n\"And that's...\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFor several seconds, Judah just stared at the spoons, his whole body twitching.  Finally, almost convulsively, his hand shot out, grabbed one of the spoons, and forced its contents into his mouth.\n\nHis body went rigid - and he screamed, a long and keening wail that cut through the interrogation room and made Muller clap her hands over her ears.\n\nThe rigidity only lasted a few seconds, but when his eyes re-opened, he looked as if he'd just aged several years.  \"Oh god,\" he gasped out, and then spun to the side as he vomited on the floor.\n\n\"What did you see?\" Sully asked, even as Muller recoiled from the puking man.\n\n\"Blood,\" Judah choked out, between shaking breaths.  \"So much blood.  He bathed himself in it, in my blood.  Kept me alive, made me watch him wear me, cut me apart!\"\n\n\"What did he look like?\"\n\nJudah, however, just shook his head, his whole body shaking.  \"No, no,\" he groaned, followed by the organic sounds of more vomiting.\n\nMuller and Sully both stood up.  \"We'll get a sketch artist in, once he's calmed down,\" Sully said.  \"We know it's a man, now.  Maybe we can get approximate height, weight, age, anything else that could help us.\"\n\nMuller, however, couldn't bring herself to care about this case.  \"Sully, you're a monster,\" she said softly, as they stepped out of the interrogation room.  \"That wasn't right.\"\n\nShe saw her partner's shoulders sag as he walked ahead of her.  \"I know,\" he answered, almost too quietly for her to hear.  \"But it might help us stop something far worse.  I pray so.\""], [9, "\"You think you are the first to ask me?\" Joseph quandried to the female detective pressing down one increment on the treadmill. \n\n\"All we are asking is that you consume some of her blood and tell us what you see. We have exhausted all leads and we know the killer has one more victim that could very well be alive.\" the lady detective told Joseph as he ran.\n\n\"You don't get it that's not how it works, the blood is not what contains the memetic properties blood is mostly acid. In order for my gift or whatever you want to call it to work I have to eat the carbon, the flesh.\" Joseph informed her jumping onto the struts and stopping the machine.\n\nThe detective grabbed a towel from the rack behind him and handed it to Joseph who took it with a meager smile and wiped his sweating brow.\n\n\"I...understand, I'm sorry to have wasted your time.\" the detective told him turning to walk off.\n\n\"Hey detective Osborne,\" Joseph began walking towards her. \"it's that little girl from Westbrook isn't it?\" \n\n\"Yes. She is the fourth victim, we suspect he took her little brother as well. We believe he will keep the boy alive until he's ready to kill him, if he follows the same pattern we have a little less than three days to find him.\" Osborne said.\n\nJoseph contemplated it taking a sip from his water bottle as his breathing steadied.\n\n\"We will need a paramedic with epinephrine and defibrillation on standby, with humans I usually end up in cardiac arrest, especially if the girl was scared when she died. Let's get one thing straight though at most I get the girl's last fifteen seconds and there is no surefire method that any gathered information will lead to anything. I'm taking it if you have asked me you have already gotten the parents permission?\" Joseph asked her.\n\n\"Yes.\" Osborne replied.\n\n\"Okay then. I hope you have a strong stomach. Might as well do it now while my heart rate is up.\" Joseph finished dreading the next two hours to come.   "], [8, "Detective Jason Freedly rubbed his hands together and frowned.

He slid me the tray, I looked down with my usual grimace.\n\nIt's been 8 years since they first discovered my ability; whenever I eat something, I can see what it saw in it's last moments. When I discovered this ability growing up, I swore off meat for good; it was horrifying to watch those poor animals get murdered by horrible human beings. When my therapist's son became a victim, she broke a vow and told the police what I was capable of; it's been 8 years since I've tasted my first corpse now; I've been involved in 5 other cases since; they pay extremely well at least.\n\n\nI spear a piece with my fork and examine it. Whoever this was looked pretty good; they sizzled him up to perfection. It was a pretty small portion though, there must not have been much left of the guy. I reached down and took my first bite.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust as I thought, one of mine.\nI didn't give up meat because I didn't like it - I gave it up because I couldn't bear to stand what those people who call themselves human beings are willing to do to torture living creatures who can't even defend themselves. This one in particular enjoyed his job; almost as much as I enjoyed killing him, and reliving that memory for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the last week. Jenkins already suspects cannabalism, but I don't think he can connect the dots.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\"This guy had a lot of experience... the victim didn't see it coming.\"  "], [1, "\u201cWell c\u2019mon kid, what\u2019re yer waiting for?

The smell of the meat filled the grey interrogation room. A smell I had forgotten for so long.\n\n\"Eat it.\" commanded the investigator. He took out a fork and a knife from the bag and placed it beside the dish and pushed them toward me. I was puzzled. I imagined that hard silverware would be forbidden in an interrogation room. I stared into the black mirror behind the investigator, hoping there's someone who could explain what was going on. Was I under arrest? What for? And they bring steak for a detainee? Then, he placed whole bags of salt and pepper on the table. He even brought a bottle of steak sauce. How generous of him.\n\n\"I'm sorry... I'm a vegan. A strict one, at that.\" I said, as I pushed the dish and the silverware back to the investigator. I used to love meat when I was young. I'd throw tantrum if our Friday family dinner were vegetarian. Mom, meat! I'd scream. I probably didn't, but that's the general image of how much I loved meat. Then, this condition of psychometry hit me. Whenever I ate something, the vision of the final moment of what I ate flooded into me. I've seen cows with their brains knocked out. Chickens drowned dead in a cesspool. Pigs dragged to their slaughter house. I've heard the churning of the machines and the screams of the animals. Needless to say, they were mostly unappetizing. Even eating plants bothered me time to time. The noise of the industrial machine... at least they didn't make me want to puke on the table.\n\n\"Eat it.\" the investigator repeated.\n\n\"No, I'm very much certain that legal enforcement can't force me to eat something I refused to do so. And am I asking too much? I will eat, if it's not meat.\" I said. The cold, still, immobile eyes of the investigator fixated on my nervous face gave me an uneasy feeling. The investigator drew out a handgun from his side and slammed it on the steel table.\n\n\"Do I look like a cop to you?\" the investigator said in a low-pitched voice. Well, I was lead into an interrogation room in a huge building by a gun-and-badge-wielding officer, so of course the investigator looked like a police officer to me. But my impression of him being a part of legal enforcement vanished like a morning dew when he grabbed his gun and pointed it at my forehead.\n\n\"...No.\" I answered. I raised my both hands in the air while the investigator pushed the plate and the silverware back to me.\n\n\"Eat it.\" the investigator said, with his finger on the trigger. I nodded several times and reached for the silverware. I sliced a tiny piece from the corner of the steak and took a bite.\n\nThere was an animal screaming, as per usual. But it was that of human. A woman's, even. She was running through a corridor. The fluorescent light of the corridor was nearly blindly dazzling. The walls were blue and there were doors every several feet. The girl tried to open few of the doors, but all of them were locked. She looked behind, and there was a man with a machete. He swung it around and flailed the girl. She didn't die so fast. He hacked and mangled the girl until the body of the girl was a heap of bloodied meat.\n\nI jumped back in horror and leaned toward the wall behind me. Then, I vomited out the entirety of my stomach's content. The foul acidic stench drooled from my lips and the floor. I scratched my tongue to scrape off what my mouth had just touched: A human flesh. I looked back to the investigator. My feet was shaking and my collar was getting soaking wet from the sudden flash of sweats I had. But the investigator was not the murderer. I stuttered, \"wh... wh... shh... sh...\" I couldn't even make out a single word. \n\n\"Julia M. Hopp. She's 117th victim of the Machete Killer.\" the investigator said. \"We want you to help us find that son of bitch.\" We. Obviously we was not spoken as in royal we. There were more of them?\n\n\"I've read the psychiatric reports from your therapist... surely you do remember Mr. Randall from David Gibson hospital, do you not? And I've been told you possess a special skill which will aid us catch that motherfucker.\" He knew my condition very well and he abused it. It disgusted me at length he'd go to catch the murderer, but what offended me the most now was that he did it fully knowing what was going to happen to me. But, he was the guy with the gun in the scene.\n\n\"Can you describe to me what you saw?\"\n\nI, at the gunpoint, obliged. I described the corridor. Its color, its length, it's doors... I couldn't remember what type of floor was there, so I simply did not mentioned anything about it. The investigator was simply nodding to my description of the scene. Did he knew where the victim was murdered? Some help would have been appreciated. And then I went on to describe the murderer.\n\n\"Holy mother of god's shit. The Machete Killer was not masked? Not in a disguise of some sort? He just had his face out?\" The investigator nearly jumped and stood on his feet. I nodded. He turned his back on me, and started to call someone on his phone. Probably asking for a facial composite specialist, I figured. After he ended his phone call, he ran outside the room.\n\nAnd returned with a stack of papers, a roll of colored pencils, and more steaming meat on a plate. I had forgotten he wasn't a cop. Being locked inside an interrogation room gave such impression on me.\n\n\"I don't... know how to draw accurate portraits...\" I mumbled.\n\n\"That's why I brought more.\" the investigator said. Well, he was the man with the gun in his hand.\n\n ", "id": "dap8k5l"}, {"comment": "This is slightly morbid and descriptive\n\nWell done!\n\nEdit: it isn't *slightly* descriptive, sorry, bad choice of words.

Why I'm here?  Am I under arrest for something?\"\n\nMuller let Sully take the lead, instead sitting back on the other side of the table and examining the young man.  Late twenties, she guessed, a little too thin.  He didn't look malnourished, but she didn't see an ounce of excess fat anywhere on him.  He looked, she thought to herself with a little shiver, like someone who didn't enjoy the idea of eating.\n\nSully set the plate down on the middle of the table, not removing its covering.  \"Judah Matthias,\" he greeted the young man.  \"No, you're not under arrest.  You're here because of your ability.\"\n\nInstantly, Judah looked alert and wary.  \"I'm not sure what you're talking about,\" he began, but Sully held up a hand.\n\n\"It's okay,\" Muller's partner said, putting on his most reassuring smile.  \"I believe you.  And we think that you can help us.\"  The smile slipped a little as he sighed, glancing over his shoulder towards the mirrored glass behind him.  \"You may be the only one who can help us.\"\n\nJudah didn't yet look convinced, but he wasn't storming out on them.  Muller finally uncrossed her arms.  \"Can you tell us, in your words, about this ability that you have?\" she asked.\n\n\"They say that it's just a delusion, that it's not real,\" Judah answered her, his non-answer evasive.\n\nMuller sighed.  \"Humor me.\"\n\n\"Please,\" added Sully, his eyes big and sincere.\n\nSomething between the two agents seemed to push Judah over the edge.  \"Okay, okay,\" he gave in.  \"Look, it's been happening to me ever since I was a little kid.  My parents thought I was weird for only wanting to eat vegetables, but I couldn't explain it to them, couldn't tell them what happened.\"\n\n\"What happened when what?\" Muller asked.\n\nJudah sighed.  \"When I ate meat,\" he said.  \"Whenever I ate meat, I'd get this little... vision, I guess.  A flashback, a sudden memory.  One that wasn't mine.  I'd feel panic, pain, see this strange creature, hazy, coming towards me with some sort of gun in its hands, pointing it at my head, and then-\" He stopped, shuddering.  \"It wasn't until I got older that I realized that I was looking at the inside of a slaughterhouse.\"\n\n\"So when you eat meat...\" Muller pressed, wanting to hear the explicit confirmation.\n\nJudah grimaced at the words, but spoke them.  \"I see the last few seconds of the animal, yes.  Different details, but that final pain, that fear, is always the same.  I'm a very strict vegetarian, sworn off all meat now.\"\n\n\"Well, as much as it pains us to ask you to do this, we're afraid that we need you to break that vow,\" Sully said after a minute.  He tapped the covered dish in front of him.  \"You've heard of the Slaughterhouse Killer?\"\n\nJudah nodded, the wariness back in his eyes.\n\n\"Well, he's struck again,\" Sully confirmed.  \"Two young women, this time - at least, as best we can tell.  Once he's finished, the area's so destroyed that it's tough to even identify the age and gender of his victims.  We have no leads.  We thought that you might be able to help.\"\n\nJudah started to open his mouth, but Sully lifted the cover off of the plate, and the young man's jaw snapped shut.  Muller fought her own urge to wince away at the sight of the objects on the plate.\n\nTwo small spoons, each containing a single chunk of browned meat, barely the size of a pea.  \n\nJudah's eyes rose up to Sully and Muller, his expression fearfully disbelieving.  \"That's not - you don't want me to-\" he stammered out.\n\nSully nodded once, sadly.  \"I'm afraid so.  And we need you to tell us everything that you see.\"\n\nThe young man turned towards Muller, perhaps hoping that she'd confirm that this was all a big joke, but she nodded.  \"We don't have any other leads,\" she revealed.\n\n\"And that's...\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFor several seconds, Judah just stared at the spoons, his whole body twitching.  Finally, almost convulsively, his hand shot out, grabbed one of the spoons, and forced its contents into his mouth.\n\nHis body went rigid - and he screamed, a long and keening wail that cut through the interrogation room and made Muller clap her hands over her ears.\n\nThe rigidity only lasted a few seconds, but when his eyes re-opened, he looked as if he'd just aged several years.  \"Oh god,\" he gasped out, and then spun to the side as he vomited on the floor.\n\n\"What did you see?\" Sully asked, even as Muller recoiled from the puking man.\n\n\"Blood,\" Judah choked out, between shaking breaths.  \"So much blood.  He bathed himself in it, in my blood.  Kept me alive, made me watch him wear me, cut me apart!\"\n\n\"What did he look like?\"\n\nJudah, however, just shook his head, his whole body shaking.  \"No, no,\" he groaned, followed by the organic sounds of more vomiting.\n\nMuller and Sully both stood up.  \"We'll get a sketch artist in, once he's calmed down,\" Sully said.  \"We know it's a man, now.  Maybe we can get approximate height, weight, age, anything else that could help us.\"\n\nMuller, however, couldn't bring herself to care about this case.  \"Sully, you're a monster,\" she said softly, as they stepped out of the interrogation room.  \"That wasn't right.\"\n\nShe saw her partner's shoulders sag as he walked ahead of her.  \"I know,\" he answered, almost too quietly for her to hear.  \"But it might help us stop something far worse.

Although I never was a fan of stucco, I remember thinking that the stone stairs and shingled roof did the place justice. This was interesting, considering we had just arrived at Death's front door.\n\nThe bowling-ball weight in my stomach quickly transformed to that of a piano, and I glanced in Mark's direction to reassure myself. It didn't work. My partner looked calm as usual, and why wouldn't he be? Composure was this guy's middle name. To make myself feel better, though, I reminded myself that the task he and I were about to complete had been in the works for years, so I had a right to be nervous. This discrepancy clearly didn't affect Mark, though, and I remember being hopeful that at least one of us had the balls to do what needed to be done. \n\nMark began up the stairs and rang the doorbell, and my legs moved forward despite my mind's best intentions. A full minute passed with only the sound of the fountain and the endless ringing of cicadas to listen to. When Mark moved his hand towards the doorbell again, I saw him. Looking through the front door's surprisingly clear glass, the silhouette of an old man crouched over his cane was making its way to the door. \n\nAs the handle slowly turned and the door opened, I began the phrase that I could never forget. \n\n\"Hello Mr. Death, have you heard the good news about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ?\".\n\nMy father's aged smile shone brilliantly in seeing his son's face again, and it took most of my strength to save me from tears. In those pale blue eyes, I could almost hear him say those three words.\n\n\"I'm proud of you.\" \nMy childhood friend Mark and I had finally finished our training, and a true Jehova's witness I, Craig Death, was to be.

An overhead security camera \nzoomed in on John as he triggered its motion sensor. \n\nHe walked out his apartment, never being able to escape the watchful gaze of the \nnew world order. He had to figure out what was bothering him. And why he couldn\u2019t remember anything before this day. \n\nHe stepped outside into the rubble of the city streets. The gargantuan foots prints \nof Mecha-Hitler pockmarked the city of D.C. He made daily rounds around the town while conducting his dictatorial duties remotely. \n\nJohn walked along the sidewalk, observing, as if for the first time, the destroyed city. Half seemed abandoned and the other seemed in shambles. John\u2019s place seemed to be the cream of the crop among this block. \n\nHe continued down an alleyway. The soot-blackened brick buildings on either side of him were both abandoned. Electricity wasn\u2019t a factor in this part of town. \n\nThat\u2019s when John eyed a particularly large piece of concrete blocking the end of the alley. For some reason, it seemed, small. Like it would be just take a push to send it flying. John stepped closer to the looming piece of rubble. The closer he stepped, the more connected he felt to it. \n\nJohn stopped a few paces short of the debris. He looked at the bottom of it, then looked up. And to his astonishment, the rubble followed. It levitated meters into the air, its shadow completely blacking out the alleyway in a cold shadow. \n\n\u201cWell, that tears it,\u201d John said, the splintering stone shrapnel bounced off the shield surrounding him, sparking and popping just inches from his eyes.  \n\nIt all came back to him. John\u2019s mission to stop the overthrow of the government, to prevent the coming of the Fourth Reich. And he had been too late to stop it. It\u2019s like he was waking up from a distant dream and slamming back into consciousness. The lightbulb above his head went off. \n\nJohn knew what he could do. He took in his surroundings. Obviously, time was of the essence. \n\n\u201cThe invasion of the revolution had only happened the other night, how bad could it possibly be,\u201d he said. \n\nJohn was going to do what he was sent to do and save the world and the country he lived in. After this is all over, John thought, I need to make sure to handle China and Japan too, they were definitely manufacturers of the army. \n\nA patrolling unit of six cyborgs approached John, guns raised. \n\n\u201cCitizen, what are you doing past curfew? Present identification,\u201d the lead cyborg said. \n\nJohn held out his left hand, palm up, then closed it. The group of cyborgs were rolled into a floating ball of black steel. The air steamed from the heat of the warped metal. \n\nHe dropped the ball, looking into the distance to where Mecha-Hitler stood. \n\nThis was going to be a good fight. \n", "id": "dark8eu"}]]], "5gabyg": ["[WP] Every once in a while you can call upon player two to help you with your life.

I immediately became ethereal and invisible the moment The door opened. I've been around long enough to know how to hide myself from even the best trained hunters.\n\n\"I know you're here, Galieel! You've become sloppy in your old age!\" The man yelled into the darkness of the house. \"Come out and be a good! Otherwise this won't be so quick and easy!\"\n\nI had no intentions of revealing myself at the behest of some mere mortal; especially someone who is so rude as to barge into someone's else's home. \n\nSuddenly the man dug into his jacket, pulled out a small circular stone, and held it up. He uttered something under his breath and the entryway he stood in was flooded with a bright, piercing light. I felt my body being pulled back into the mortal realm against my will. My innards turned and twisted as I came crashing to the wooden floor.\n\n\"There you are,\" the man knelt down next to my curled frame. \"Funny, I thought you'd be bigger.\"\n\nI managed to look up at him through the involuntary convulsions my entire body was going through to see his face. He was old, shriveled, and missing his right eye. White strands of hair dangled from his head and peeked out beneath his long brimmed hat. He held the stone in his hand as it continued to illuminate the old house. The stone had a rune etched onto it that was glowing brightly. I remembered the rune immediately. A Hunter's Sigil. Fear gripped my entire being.\n\n\"I w-won't go back!\" I struggled to say between the convulsions. \"R-release me, Mortal!\"\n\nThe man frowned. \"You Demons are all the same.

Now, lets get you sealed up and ready for the Trial of Fleeing.\" He reached into his jacket with his spare hand.\n\nI didn't wait to see what he had in store for me. I summoned every ounce of strength I had left and tried crawling towards the door. My claws raked and scratched against the wooden floor but it was to no avail. A sudden immense pain shot through my back as the old man lunged the knife he drew into my spine.

I've captured thousands of your kind. Each said the same thing before they were captured.\" He pulled another rune from his jacket and placed it on my head.

How very odd indeed.\n\nFew mortals possessed the ability to detect a demon's presence simply by forcing their own presence into its proximity. Fewer still would ever dare to consider that what they felt was truly the presence of a demon - after all, in this mockery of an organism which is so aptly called 'society', what is there to be gained by subscribing to ridiculed beliefs and concepts? The age of the outsider had risen, and so, outsiders had become insiders, and again it was 'uncool' be an outsider.\n\nNow, though, I seemed to have found an insider: an individual inside of my very own house.\n\nBut, I am old and I am wizened. I know that not all is what it appears to be. People of this new age do things which those of the old world would not even consider. To say such a seemingly crazed thing might once have earned you a flogging, or perhaps earlier, a ritualistic 'cleansing' which inevitably ended in an untimely demise. It was once that the only manner in which these alien actions, phrases, and statements could be comprehended by the bumbling masses and the overbearing hierarchies of the world was to suggest that a 'demon' such as myself  had 'possessed' that individual. Of course, this is absurd: demons do not possess people. They possess places. Even the most rudimentary education in the art of evil should give this simple fact to the most idiotic of humans.\n\nSo, into my house this man waltzed. Oh! Deary me - I dared to assume that he was a man. Another tangent of this modern age which I am so glad to have transcended. Yes, idiots, this was a man, a man upon whom I gazed, and upon whom I did intend to wreak the most audacious of havoc. Something was oddly familiar about him - reminiscent of a young boy I recalled from years past, when this house had last bustled with activity. My ethereal fingers twitched with anticipation.\n\nHis nonchalant, possessive swagger did not scare me. It was intimidating, admittedly, but fear was not my reaction. No, it was a strange allure - a daring attachment, of sorts. This intrusive young fool, as arrogant and stupid as he must have been, sent a chill down my spine as I watched him strut into this house. I exhaled unwillingly, sending a chatter through the dying window drapes at the man's left. He glanced without the slightest hint of surprise to this disturbance in his existential plane. Slowly, my anxiety grew. Oh, what wonderful fun we might have together, this demon of a man and this most tenable of a demon.\n\nI knew, however, that the escapades, the turmoils, and the conflicts which we would so fervently enjoy must eventually find their bloody denouement.\n\nIt is not without reason that we hurt the ones we love most."], [7, "A man in his early thirties entered the doorway, adorned with a black suit under a thick coat of the same color. He casually lit a cigarette and inspected the home, running his fingers along the drywall. I moved from within the walls, embracing his presence and reveling in the thought of his corruption. Carrying a small suitcase with him, I followed him through the house, deciding to play with my victim. Without his knowledge, I locked him the house, giving him no escape route. When he heard the click, a smile crawled across his face.\n\n\u201cSorry to burst your bubble,\u201d he began with a confident tone. \u201cBut you\u2019re leaving this house before I do.\u201d\n\nIntrigued by his hubris, I watched him work as he spray painted a sigil across the living room and, after removing them from his bag, arranged candles in a particular order. As he tried using his matches to light the candles, I tried to blow them out, but realized I couldn\u2019t touch him. Confused, I looked at the sigil and realized its significance. In the language of demons, it conveyed a clear message: Do Not Touch.\n\nAs he lit the candles, he began an incantation which pierced my ears like the screams from the bowels of Hell. I dug my fingers into the house, refusing to let go of my prize. He sat in the middle of the formation of candles, refusing to let me think clearly. Tightening my grip on the living room, I managed to crack the sigil behind him, effectively breaking him of its protection. Using the opportunity, I slid the coffee table in his direction, barely conscious enough to aim, but it met its mark.\n\nThe flames scorched the wooden floor, as the man stumbled to his feet. As I regained my footing, I sent every object in the house into the air. Everything, from every single piece of silverware to the furniture hung in the air before I relentlessly began throwing them at him. He made a quick maneuver to evade the sofa, which quickly became embedded in the wall, but I managed to clip him with a vase filled with water and hairdryer. \n\nAs he dodged my attack, he spoke in the ancient tongue of demons and released a spell which forced me from walls, and put me in a semi-corporal form. I felt my force slowly drained from the confines of the house and accumulate something like a body of pure energy in the living room with him. I rose up in a roughly humanoid figure, and began my advancement towards the human. With a crucifix clutched in his hand and reciting some exorcism, I bashed his weapon from his fist, and secured my essence around his mouth. I watched him kick and flail as I suffocated the life from his body. \n\nBefore the light faded from his eyes, however, I felt a cold pain. Looking down, I noticed his sliced me some sort of blade. I felt as if my essence began to leak. Unable to hold my form, I watched helplessly as I sunk to the floor and released my grip. With bruises around his neck, he gasped for air for a moment before regaining his composure. \n\n\u201cSt. Thomas, you bastard,\u201d he proclaimed, largely to himself, I imagined. \u201cI knew you said your blessed blade deal some serious damage to demons, but damn!\u201d\n\nI tried to regain my form or otherwise repossess the house, but the exorcism he recited forced me into a paralysis which I tried to fight; but I felt the forces of Hell pulling at my essence. I tried fighting, but as I fought and clawed against the floor, the last thing of earth I saw before returning to The Pit was the man passionately giving me the finger. \n\n*****\n\nr/Andrew__Wells"], [5, "The house shook as a lone voice echos in the halls, \"Now demon, you're stuck in here with me.\" I cock my head and smile, \n       \"Is that so?\" I ask with a piqued curiosity. I watch him from a mirror in the hallway.\n        \"It is.\" He picks up a bag and wanders in the house's main hallway. \n       \"It's been a long time since a human had the gall to speak that sway to me.\" I can't stop myself from smiling. He just stands in the hall looking annoyed which intrigues me even further, what an odd human. \n         \"You're a woman I understand,\" He speaks to me in an odd manner, not something I've come across.\n         \"I am a demon, I can be whichever gender I wish.\" I reply with an odd amount of patience. He nods and pulls out what looks like a human gun, I wonder what's in it. I'm sure he realizes he can't shoot me with normal bullets but I've seen a show where they use salt bullets so I wouldn't be too surprised if this human used the same....or perhaps he's an idiot and I'm overestimating him. \n       \"As demons can be.\" He comments cocking the gun. \n      \"As most humans can be as well darling,\" I find myself smiling. He smirks which humors me even more, this human will be very interesting and fun to play with."], [2, "As far as jobs go, haunting the Walton house was pretty shitty. But apparently it's always going to be 'your responsibility' since you did kind of, sort of, influence Mary Walton to murder her parents and older brother. Okay, so you incessantly nagged her until she caved and did it. \n\nYou liked Mary Walton. That's why the parents and the brother had to go. They were complete shitheads. No respect, absolutely none for the poor girl. She was twenty three and still living under their thumb! It was pathetic. Mary was your favorite vessel by far, because you fit her like a glove. You're not sure why. You have some faint memories of once being someone- a woman- and maybe that's why. But you doubt it was just because of her sex. \n\nMaybe you saw something of yourself in her. Whatever scrap of human was left, maybe it was something like her. But you were human long ago, and whatever you experienced then was burned out of you when you made your deal. You probably weren't a very good person. Good people usually don't have to make deals. \n\n'Why serve in Heaven when you could reign in Hell' sounds nice, but it's more complicated than that. There are hierarchies and rules, and in reality, the Iceman does very little. He'd rather leave it to a thousand scrabbling, bickering underlings, all plotting and scheming and entertaining thoughts of a second war with the guys in the sky. You were all for it, when you first started out. It sounded good. You were going to burn down those pearly gates and shove Michael's sword up his own-\n\nYou were an idiot. Here you are, nose to the brimstone, serving. \n\nMary Walton is probably going to Hell for what she did, but you figure you can put in a good word for her when she gets there. Get her a nice position so she's not one of the grinders, screaming and sobbing down in the pits. She doesn't deserve that.\n\nSo now there's this guy. Well, great. You haven't had a good tussle since the seventies, and that priest was *very* overweight. This one's young, but the pomp and circumstance rings true. No collar, though. Besides that of his flannel shirt as he takes off his jacket. He looks like a lumberjack, you think idly, as the lights pop and fizzle, shadowing the entry way.\n\n\"Come out,\" he says casually. \"I want to talk, demon.\"\n\nHe doesn't even have a clue what your name is, or he would already use it. You can see the edges of his mind like a fraying quilt. You tug at a thread, comb through it hurriedly, searching, and when you step forward, you are his mother, long brown hair and green eyes and gentle smile.\n\n\"I've missed you,\" you croon, extending a soft hand towards his face. \n\nHe clamps down on your cold wrist and a heat like a brand travels up your arm. You hiss in pain and tear your arm away, flickering in annoyance, and solidify into a more neutral form you glimpsed. A friend from high school. Died of cancer. She must have been a bit of a rocker- you have a lot of piercings now. \n\n\"What do you want, David?\" you ask bluntly in her rasping voice, fumbling with the pack of cigarettes she always carried around with her.\n\n\"Sasha quit smoking after we graduated,\" he informs you. \n\n\"Well, maybe it's time she started again,\" you retort, and regard him carefully. He has nothing on him that could hurt you- but his touch. You haven't felt that much heat in such a long time, there's a fading imprint on your tattooed wrist. \n\n\"I want a deal,\" he says. \n\n\"Didn't have to be so hostile if that's all you wanted.\" You rummage around for a pen. \"Are you a froster?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You know- half and half. Your mom hook up with one of the princes? Asmodeus, maybe? Rosier? But usually the women don't survive the birth- and you remember her pretty well,\" you look at him a little suspiciously.\n\n\"I'm completely human,\" he finally replies, stiffly. \n\nYou arch an eyebrow, slam the paper and pen down in front of him. \"Guessing this is a binding one?

See, I broke the system.  Me, a Sloth Demon of all things! You'd send yourself to the first ring of the seventh circle if you knew how many mortals want to make contact with a real demon through a damn click-bait ad!  It's mostly the elderly or children, but hey, a soul's a soul.  \n\nBut you're probably wondering, how is a demon setting all this up? \n\nHold on, give me a second...thinking makes me tired.\n\nAlright.  I think I'm ready. \n\nFirstly, I broke out of hell fairly recently.  Some fat, pathetic looking mortal who wished to live comfortably for the rest of his life summoned me.  As you already know, I am a SLOTH Demon and was more than happy to grant the request.  I even almost felt sorry for the poor flesh bag, so we made a deal: to switch places.  Of course I am one of the sullen, so either he's probably already drowned in the river Styx, or turned into a 21st century Achilles and fighting Wrath Demons by now.  That's what you get for making a deal with a demon I suppose.  \n\nSo, one thing led to another and I discovered this thing called the \"Internet.\"  About a couple Winter Solstices after, I set up shop in an abandoned home within distance to a technologically retarded old croon who owns an unsecured open access point.\n\nThat's basically all there is to it.  I might have left out a few details, but who needs details when I need sleep?\n\nI yawned one more time.  It was already 4 pm and I was so very tired and ready to call it an afternoon.  Just then, I heard the door front door from downstairs slam shut.\n\n\"Now demon, you're stuck in here with me.\"  I heard those words echo through the walls of my domain. \n\nYou've got to be kidding me? Is this a joke?  What kind of mortal hunts demons in the 21st century?  A loon.  That's who.\n\n\"Come out demon!  I know you're here!\" \n\nHe wouldn't give up and he was interfering with my beauty sleep, so I finally gave in.  \n\n\"Go away mortal! You have no place here,\"  I yell back at him, my words shaking the whole house in an effort to scare him off.\n\n\"You and I have unfinished business demon!\" I could see through the walls that he was trying to regain his balance from the display of my power. \n\nWhat unfinished business?  I peered again through the walls at the mortal again and something about him did strike me as familiar.  My curiosity peaked.  I don't think I had been that anxious since I first set foot on the mortal plane.  \n\n\"Very well mortal, \" my voice shook the house again.  \"I am upstairs down the hall, second door on the right!\"\n\nI waited in silence.  Who was he?  An unhappy customer?  Another demon's familiar trying to get rid of me?  I just had to know.  After a minute I heard the door crack open and my jaw dropped.\n\nIt was him.  The mortal I spoke of earlier.  The one who swapped places with me.\n\n\"Well, well.  Look who broke out of hell all on his own.  I thought you wanted a comfortable life?\"  I smirked at him, I took my closed laptop and pushed it under my bed.  \n\n\"What do you want big-boy?  Why do you pursue me?\"  I called him big-boy, but he looked a lot skinnier than the last time I saw him.\n\n\"I've come for revenge.\"\n\n\"Revenge?\"  I looked at him for a second before balling up laughing. \n\n\"What's with the sudden change of heart, mortal?  I remember very clearly the last time I saw you, you didn't want to do anything.  Why look for and pursue me now?  More importantly, how did you even get out of the fifth circle?\"\n\n\"When you sent me to die in the river Styx, a demon named Ira fished me out by my collar and made a deal with me.  They said I could be sent back to the mortal world as long as I sent you back to the river where you belonged.\"\n\nIra has been a thorn in my side for half of a Millennium.  She's a Wrath Demon who likes to think that she keeps the Sloth Demon's in check.  She's out of her mind if she thinks she can touch me now, but this mortal may be dangerous now.  I thought to use a better use another tactic if I wanted to keep my newfound lifestyle.  \n\n\"Well...,\" my mind felt like it was racing over the possibilities of the mortal actually sending me back.  \n\n\"it sounds like you don't need to send me back immediately.\"\n\n\"No, but I really want to so I can get back at you for sending me to that horrible place.\"  The mortal reached for the back pocket and pulled out a black book.  I didn't realize what it actually was until he started speaking in Latin.  Against my nature, I felt I had to act quickly.  \n\nI took a deep breath and holes opened out of my arms.  A purple gas started to fill the room and seemingly began to caress the mortal.  I exhaled through my nose.  I had him. That was a close one.  I didn't want to be banished from this realm so soon.  \n\n\"Come on now Terry.  You don't HAVE to do this...you could always just go back home and lay down and take a nap.  Doesn't that sound wonderful?\"  The mortal's eyes glazed over and turned purple.  \n\n\"Y-yeah.  That's sounds nice.\"  You could tell he was fighting it.  He was almost hard to control, but I guess that's what being dunked in the river Styx does to a mortal.  It makes them more immune to a demon's temptation.  \n\n\"Now, go home Terry so uncle Belphegor can take a nap.\"\n\nThe purple dust danced around the mortal and lead him to the top of the stairs.\n\n\"Say hi to Ira for me, Terry.\"  I snapped my fingers and the purple dust disappeared.  The mortal regained control of himself, but not before losing his balance on the top step, and breaking his neck on the way down, instantly killing him.  \n\nI had a hunch his neck was his heel.  He said Ira fished him from his collar.  \n\nAfter looking at his body from a distance for a few seconds I thought about cleaning up the evidence, but then decided that taking a nap was higher up on my priorities.  I'll do it tomorrow."], [1, "\"FOR FUCK'S SAKE!\" The looming figure lashed out at the wall, tearing some of the yellowed wallpaper right off the wall, and seemingly immediately regretting his actions, if his hopping up and down whilst clutching his foot was anything to go by.\n\n\"Erm...\" The other figure scratched his head, looking at his companion in confusion. \"What the hell are you going on about Hound? Are you alright?\"\n\n\"NO I'M BLOODY NOT ALRIGHT!\" The spindly figure of the larger man grabbed the other one by the shoulders, and showing surprising strength for his frame, hoisted him off the ground and shook him.\n\n\"JESUS H FUCKING CHRIST CALM YOUR TITS HOUND!\" Hound quickly dropped his companion raising his hands in a gesture of supplication. The other man brushed the front of his suit off, and continued. \"Now, what's wrong.\"\n\nHound marched over to the stairs in a strop, sitting on the second step, which creaked worryingly as he did. \"I'm sorry Hastings, it's just... Well this is the second time, you know?\"\n\n\"The second time? Well, I mean house shopping isn't fun, but I mean-\"\n\n\"The last one had a ghost.\" Hound interjected.\n\n\"Yes, the last one had a ghost, but it's not like you can keep staying there, she's... well I don't mean to be rude, but she's ruddy annoying.\" Hastings continued, staring through the darkness and dust at Hound's general direction.\n\n\"I never thought a ghost could drink at all, let alone *so much*.\" Hound shook his head, recalling all the good scotch he lost to that unruly apparition. \"But that's actually my point.\" Hound sighed and leaned back against the stairs.\n\n\"Wait, don't tell me...\" Hastings took a step back towards the door, contemplating bolting before he got roped into another stupid situation. \"There's another ghost, isn't there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Hound produced a hip flask from his overcoat, and drained the contents in about half a second flat. \"Well, technically, it's a demon. I think.\" Hound said, waving the hip flask in Hasting's direction. \n\n\"Oh bollocks. So that's what you were yelling about earlier.\" Hastings stepped forwards and leaned against the banister, having abandoned all hope of escape.  \"We're going to need to call the church are we?\" I winced slightly at the thought. I didn't like priests, not one bit, always trying to banish me and such.\n\n\"I bloody well hope not.\" Hound returned the hip flask to his coat, and stood. \"I don't like priests, not one bit. Always trying to cleanse me and such.\" \n\nI think I like this one.\n\n\"Well, how the hell are we meant to deal with it then. I can't even see it, but then again, it is pitch black in here.\" Hastings waved his arms about the room as if that illustrated his point. \"I think we should just call the Church and let them deal with it.\" \n\n\"No, we'll deal with it ourselves.\" Hound said, moving past Hastings and heading into the living room. \"And if you can't see, just... I don't know, cast a spell or something, you're a mage, aren't you?\" \n\n\"So are you.\" Hastings retorted, as his right hand burst into a soft orange flame, that bathed the dust clogged room in a warm glow.\n\n\"Yes, but I can see in the dark.\" Hound countered, tapping his temple. \"This is starting to feel really familiar, you know?\"\n\n\"I know exactly what you mean. Anyway, let's go... find this demon?\" Hastings said without an ounce of confidence. \n\nI watched from a distance, my body passing through the floor boards of the room above, and my head, invisible to them, poking out ceiling tracked them as they walked out of the hall way, and into the living room. It'd been a while since I'd had a game of hide and seek.

How very odd indeed.\n\nFew mortals possessed the ability to detect a demon's presence simply by forcing their own presence into its proximity. Fewer still would ever dare to consider that what they felt was truly the presence of a demon - after all, in this mockery of an organism which is so aptly called 'society', what is there to be gained by subscribing to ridiculed beliefs and concepts? The age of the outsider had risen, and so, outsiders had become insiders, and again it was 'uncool' be an outsider.\n\nNow, though, I seemed to have found an insider: an individual inside of my very own house.\n\nBut, I am old and I am wizened. I know that not all is what it appears to be. People of this new age do things which those of the old world would not even consider. To say such a seemingly crazed thing might once have earned you a flogging, or perhaps earlier, a ritualistic 'cleansing' which inevitably ended in an untimely demise. It was once that the only manner in which these alien actions, phrases, and statements could be comprehended by the bumbling masses and the overbearing hierarchies of the world was to suggest that a 'demon' such as myself  had 'possessed' that individual. Of course, this is absurd: demons do not possess people. They possess places. Even the most rudimentary education in the art of evil should give this simple fact to the most idiotic of humans.\n\nSo, into my house this man waltzed. Oh! Deary me - I dared to assume that he was a man. Another tangent of this modern age which I am so glad to have transcended. Yes, idiots, this was a man, a man upon whom I gazed, and upon whom I did intend to wreak the most audacious of havoc. Something was oddly familiar about him - reminiscent of a young boy I recalled from years past, when this house had last bustled with activity. My ethereal fingers twitched with anticipation.\n\nHis nonchalant, possessive swagger did not scare me. It was intimidating, admittedly, but fear was not my reaction. No, it was a strange allure - a daring attachment, of sorts. This intrusive young fool, as arrogant and stupid as he must have been, sent a chill down my spine as I watched him strut into this house. I exhaled unwillingly, sending a chatter through the dying window drapes at the man's left. He glanced without the slightest hint of surprise to this disturbance in his existential plane. Slowly, my anxiety grew. Oh, what wonderful fun we might have together, this demon of a man and this most tenable of a demon.\n\nI knew, however, that the escapades, the turmoils, and the conflicts which we would so fervently enjoy must eventually find their bloody denouement.\n\nIt is not without reason that we hurt the ones we love most.", "id": "daqypsc"}], [{"comment": "A man in his early thirties entered the doorway, adorned with a black suit under a thick coat of the same color. He casually lit a cigarette and inspected the home, running his fingers along the drywall. I moved from within the walls, embracing his presence and reveling in the thought of his corruption. Carrying a small suitcase with him, I followed him through the house, deciding to play with my victim. Without his knowledge, I locked him the house, giving him no escape route. When he heard the click, a smile crawled across his face.\n\n\u201cSorry to burst your bubble,\u201d he began with a confident tone. \u201cBut you\u2019re leaving this house before I do.\u201d\n\nIntrigued by his hubris, I watched him work as he spray painted a sigil across the living room and, after removing them from his bag, arranged candles in a particular order. As he tried using his matches to light the candles, I tried to blow them out, but realized I couldn\u2019t touch him. Confused, I looked at the sigil and realized its significance. In the language of demons, it conveyed a clear message: Do Not Touch.\n\nAs he lit the candles, he began an incantation which pierced my ears like the screams from the bowels of Hell. I dug my fingers into the house, refusing to let go of my prize. He sat in the middle of the formation of candles, refusing to let me think clearly. Tightening my grip on the living room, I managed to crack the sigil behind him, effectively breaking him of its protection. Using the opportunity, I slid the coffee table in his direction, barely conscious enough to aim, but it met its mark.\n\nThe flames scorched the wooden floor, as the man stumbled to his feet. As I regained my footing, I sent every object in the house into the air. Everything, from every single piece of silverware to the furniture hung in the air before I relentlessly began throwing them at him. He made a quick maneuver to evade the sofa, which quickly became embedded in the wall, but I managed to clip him with a vase filled with water and hairdryer. \n\nAs he dodged my attack, he spoke in the ancient tongue of demons and released a spell which forced me from walls, and put me in a semi-corporal form. I felt my force slowly drained from the confines of the house and accumulate something like a body of pure energy in the living room with him. I rose up in a roughly humanoid figure, and began my advancement towards the human. With a crucifix clutched in his hand and reciting some exorcism, I bashed his weapon from his fist, and secured my essence around his mouth. I watched him kick and flail as I suffocated the life from his body. \n\nBefore the light faded from his eyes, however, I felt a cold pain. Looking down, I noticed his sliced me some sort of blade. I felt as if my essence began to leak. Unable to hold my form, I watched helplessly as I sunk to the floor and released my grip. With bruises around his neck, he gasped for air for a moment before regaining his composure. \n\n\u201cSt. Thomas, you bastard,\u201d he proclaimed, largely to himself, I imagined. \u201cI knew you said your blessed blade deal some serious damage to demons, but damn!\u201d\n\nI tried to regain my form or otherwise repossess the house, but the exorcism he recited forced me into a paralysis which I tried to fight; but I felt the forces of Hell pulling at my essence.

Why do you pursue me?\"  I called him big-boy, but he looked a lot skinnier than the last time I saw him.\n\n\"I've come for revenge.\"\n\n\"Revenge?\"  I looked at him for a second before balling up laughing. \n\n\"What's with the sudden change of heart, mortal?  I remember very clearly the last time I saw you, you didn't want to do anything.  Why look for and pursue me now?  More importantly, how did you even get out of the fifth circle?\"\n\n\"When you sent me to die in the river Styx, a demon named Ira fished me out by my collar and made a deal with me.  They said I could be sent back to the mortal world as long as I sent you back to the river where you belonged.\"\n\nIra has been a thorn in my side for half of a Millennium.  She's a Wrath Demon who likes to think that she keeps the Sloth Demon's in check.  She's out of her mind if she thinks she can touch me now, but this mortal may be dangerous now.  I thought to use a better use another tactic if I wanted to keep my newfound lifestyle.  \n\n\"Well...,\" my mind felt like it was racing over the possibilities of the mortal actually sending me back.  \n\n\"it sounds like you don't need to send me back immediately.\"\n\n\"No, but I really want to so I can get back at you for sending me to that horrible place.\"  The mortal reached for the back pocket and pulled out a black book.  I didn't realize what it actually was until he started speaking in Latin.  Against my nature, I felt I had to act quickly.  \n\nI took a deep breath and holes opened out of my arms.  A purple gas started to fill the room and seemingly began to caress the mortal.  I exhaled through my nose.  I had him. That was a close one.  I didn't want to be banished from this realm so soon.  \n\n\"Come on now Terry.  You don't HAVE to do this...you could always just go back home and lay down and take a nap.  Doesn't that sound wonderful?\"  The mortal's eyes glazed over and turned purple.  \n\n\"Y-yeah.  That's sounds nice.\"  You could tell he was fighting it.  He was almost hard to control, but I guess that's what being dunked in the river Styx does to a mortal.  It makes them more immune to a demon's temptation.  \n\n\"Now, go home Terry so uncle Belphegor can take a nap.\"\n\nThe purple dust danced around the mortal and lead him to the top of the stairs.\n\n\"Say hi to Ira for me, Terry.\"  I snapped my fingers and the purple dust disappeared.  The mortal regained control of himself, but not before losing his balance on the top step, and breaking his neck on the way down, instantly killing him.  \n\nI had a hunch his neck was his heel.  He said Ira fished him from his collar.  \n\nAfter looking at his body from a distance for a few seconds I thought about cleaning up the evidence, but then decided that taking a nap was higher up on my priorities.  I'll do it tomorrow.", "id": "darjs50"}], [{"comment": "\"FOR FUCK'S SAKE!\" The looming figure lashed out at the wall, tearing some of the yellowed wallpaper right off the wall, and seemingly immediately regretting his actions, if his hopping up and down whilst clutching his foot was anything to go by.\n\n\"Erm...\" The other figure scratched his head, looking at his companion in confusion. \"What the hell are you going on about Hound? Are you alright?\"\n\n\"NO I'M BLOODY NOT ALRIGHT!\" The spindly figure of the larger man grabbed the other one by the shoulders, and showing surprising strength for his frame, hoisted him off the ground and shook him.\n\n\"JESUS H FUCKING CHRIST CALM YOUR TITS HOUND!\" Hound quickly dropped his companion raising his hands in a gesture of supplication. The other man brushed the front of his suit off, and continued. \"Now, what's wrong.\"\n\nHound marched over to the stairs in a strop, sitting on the second step, which creaked worryingly as he did. \"I'm sorry Hastings, it's just... Well this is the second time, you know?\"\n\n\"The second time? Well, I mean house shopping isn't fun, but I mean-\"\n\n\"The last one had a ghost.\" Hound interjected.\n\n\"Yes, the last one had a ghost, but it's not like you can keep staying there, she's... well I don't mean to be rude, but she's ruddy annoying.\" Hastings continued, staring through the darkness and dust at Hound's general direction.\n\n\"I never thought a ghost could drink at all, let alone *so much*.\" Hound shook his head, recalling all the good scotch he lost to that unruly apparition. \"But that's actually my point.\" Hound sighed and leaned back against the stairs.\n\n\"Wait, don't tell me...\" Hastings took a step back towards the door, contemplating bolting before he got roped into another stupid situation. \"There's another ghost, isn't there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Hound produced a hip flask from his overcoat, and drained the contents in about half a second flat. \"Well, technically, it's a demon. I think.\" Hound said, waving the hip flask in Hasting's direction. \n\n\"Oh bollocks. So that's what you were yelling about earlier.\" Hastings stepped forwards and leaned against the banister, having abandoned all hope of escape.  \"We're going to need to call the church are we?\" I winced slightly at the thought. I didn't like priests, not one bit, always trying to banish me and such.\n\n\"I bloody well hope not.\" Hound returned the hip flask to his coat, and stood. \"I don't like priests, not one bit. Always trying to cleanse me and such.\" \n\nI think I like this one.\n\n\"Well, how the hell are we meant to deal with it then. I can't even see it, but then again, it is pitch black in here.\" Hastings waved his arms about the room as if that illustrated his point. \"I think we should just call the Church and let them deal with it.\" \n\n\"No, we'll deal with it ourselves.\" Hound said, moving past Hastings and heading into the living room. \"And if you can't see, just... I don't know, cast a spell or something, you're a mage, aren't you?\" \n\n\"So are you.\" Hastings retorted, as his right hand burst into a soft orange flame, that bathed the dust clogged room in a warm glow.\n\n\"Yes, but I can see in the dark.\" Hound countered, tapping his temple. \"This is starting to feel really familiar, you know?\"\n\n\"I know exactly what you mean. Anyway, let's go... find this demon?\" Hastings said without an ounce of confidence. \n\nI watched from a distance, my body passing through the floor boards of the room above, and my head, invisible to them, poking out ceiling tracked them as they walked out of the hall way, and into the living room. It'd been a while since I'd had a game of hide and seek.

When perfected, I could venture into the streets in all manner of faces-- sometimes with the brightest of red hair, or the curliest shade of black, or even with blindingly fair hair and blue eyes-- and it made not the slightest difference. People greeted me fairly, as if I was in my usual attire and visage, and at times people even stopped from their daily routine just to speak with me. When I feigned an accent, they would inquire eagerly of where I came, and upon my blunt answers they would smile and attempt to alleviate possible consternation; \"Oh, you aren't all so bad,\" they would say, or, \"Well, I for one don't care for the sentiment against your people.\"\n\nAnd it was all a thing of beauty.", "id": "dar9s1h"}, {"comment": "What an uplifting response!

He doesn't pray for his hearing. He doesn't pray for a quick death, or for money, or for status. He's dirt poor, lonely, miserable. He doesn't pray for a lover. He prays for a feeling. A feeling! Not even a mood, something stable, something solid. He prays, for a single moment's worth of joy. A single moment! It's right there in the file, he specifies the length. He makes a sacrifice in return too, that's the odd part. He prays that he'd give his hearing, if he only feels a moment's worth of joy before he dies. I can hear you think, well he's already deaf so that's no sacrifice. Yeah, well, except the prayer is time-stamped a year before his deafness begins. \n\nHis hearing for a feeling. What a bargain! I sit there, thinking, what the hell is he thinking? His hearing would bring him so many moment's of joy, why would he give it up for a single moment? I don't get it, but it's a good bargain. Entropy is a guiding rule in this department, we always have to do a cost-benefit analysis of every request. If the entropy books are unbalanced, God gets pretty mad. Well, a moment's worth of joy is nothing compared to processing sounds for a life, so it's a no brainer. I don't get it, but I comply. Hey, it makes me look good on paper. So, his prayer is answered. He gets his minute of joy, and DoD (Department of Death) is notified of his early termination. They set the dates, so I don't know what they decided.\n\nA few years later, in the middle of a typical boring day, music starts playing on the radio. I never liked music much, partly because I never felt a thing, but partly because I don't have rhythm. But this tune, it's enchanting. More than that, it does something to me.

The force of the impact sent waves of tremors through the earth below.\n\n\"Ahhh- ugh -ow,\" Morty grunted from behind the driver's seat of the tiny spaceship. He rubbed his forehead and blinked a few times to assess the situation.  His eyes grew wide with panic. \n\n\"Ohhhh!! Oh, jeez, Rick! I- I-I'm sorry! Ohhhh no! I- I don't know! What happened?! Where did that thing even come from?\" \n\nRick threw a wayward glance toward Morty, his eyes bloodshot and half-shut.\n\n\"Way to go, Morty,\" he began. \"You're the only person on earth who ever flew an inter-dimensional spaceship into an immobile object.\"\n\n\"We're the only two people on earth who've ever driven this thing!\" Morty shouted, throwing his hands up indignantly.  \n\n\"You're missing the point, Morty,\" Rick continued, reaching into his lab coat and withdrawing a flask.  His practiced hands unscrewed the top and popped it open in less than a second.  \"The point is, you're an idiot, and grandpa hates you.\" He took a long drink from the flask as Morty frowned and stared at the floor of the ship.\n\n\"I-If I'd been dri-*urrrp*-iving, Morty, this wouldn't have happened. But no. Some of your- because of your adolescent, uh, you know, rage, going on, your adolescent hormones, thinking now that you, you know, got some juices going on, flowing in there, now you have to take every opportunity you could possibly have to drive everything and anything anywhere. And I bl*urp*lame myself, too, Morty. I can't believe I accommodated you and your, little rage- rage juice there, Morty. And now you've rammed the pinnacle of my life's work into the side of phone booth.\"\n\nRick raised a hand as he began to continue his thought, but was interrupted by a sudden burst of bright, artificial light spilling out of the phone booth in front of them.  A tall, skinny man emerged from the front of the booth wearing a neat, brown coat which matched the color of his hair.  Underneath the coat he wore a freshly pressed white shirt and a perfectly knotted red bow tie. Behind him, a woman with long, red hair stepped out of the booth as well. She wore a plaid blouse with dark-colored slacks and a pair of boots. \n\nRick's expression grew from one of slightly annoyed boredom to bemused interest. He signaled for Morty to join him as he exited the spacecraft.  As Rick walked toward the couple exiting the phone booth, he took another look at the ship.  Rick cringed and held his face in his right hand as he saw just how extensive the damage to his ship was. He sighed and continued toward the others.\n\n\"Sorry for interrupting your cramped, weird, phone-booth sex.\"\n\n\"Rick!\" Morty shouted, looking incredulous. \n\n\"Excuse me?\" Asked the man in the bow-tie, raising an eyebrow.  \n\n\"Well I just call it like I-\" Rick's words were cut off as he caught a glimpse through the open door of the booth.  Inside was a gigantic chamber with a series of complicated-looking electronics and controls. \n\n\"Holy shit, I've seen this technology before. You're a time lord, aren't you?\" Rick asked, turning to the man in front of the booth. \n\n\"I am indeed,\" he began, smiling. \"I am the Doctor.\"\n\nRick stared blankly at him. \"Doctor of what?\" He asked.\n\n\"Just- well, 'The Doctor',\" The Doctor responded.\n\nRick's eyes narrowed. \"All right, 'Doctor', well forgive me if I don't exactly trust someone who shares the same nickname as a crack dealer without any further explanation of where the title comes from.\" He looked toward Morty, expecting that his rude comment would have prompted another angry outburst, but Morty was preoccupied with staring at the red-haired woman.\n\nThe Doctor seemed to notice as well. \"Ah-hem.\" He cleared his throat. \"And this is Amy, she is my-\"\n\n\"Hi Amy.\" Morty called out, interrupting The Doctor.\n\nEveryone stared at Morty.\n\n\"Er- hello,\" Amy replied.\n\n\"Okay. Amy and The Doctor. Great. I'm Rick, and this is Morty. He's my grandson. Now we alllll know each other,\" Rick said, once again removing his flask from his coat. \"Is your craft still operational? My dipshit grandson destroyed mine when he attempted to destroy yours.\" \n\n\"Well, I'm not sure,\" The Doctor said, removing his sonic screwdriver from his coat pocket. \n\n\"Oh, great. The deus ex machina device,\" Rick said.\n\n\"If you say so,\" The Doctor said, shrugging. He activated the device and it began to whir as he pointed it in the direction of the damaged portion of the ship.\"Call it what you will, but it's light-years ahead of anything you've got, Rick of dimension C-137.\" \n\n\"Oooooooh,\" Rick started. \"I suppose I would be impressed if you had to do more than think about what you wanted while pushing a button to achieve results. It's like the Staples button of science-fiction writing. Also, light-years are a measure of distance, not time, but what would you know? You're just a doctor.\"\n\nThe doctor stopped using the screwdriver and rolled his eyes. \"The metaphor works equally well for distance *or* time.\"\n\nRick's face settled into its natural grimace. A small amount of drool collected under his bottom lip. \"Well, while yo- *urp* ou're over there doing nothing and somehow getting what you need anyway, I'm going to collect the parts I need with my dipshit- er, grandson. C'mon Morty.\" Rick turned to walk back toward his ship.  He reached into another one of his lab coat pockets and produced his portal gun.  Firing it, a swirling, green vapor materialized in the darkness.\n\n\"Wait!\" Amy shouted, walking toward the portal. \"You've crashed into us, and now you're just going to leave us here to fix the wreck?\" \n\nRick took another swig from his flask. \"Well, I hate to correct you, Amy, but it was you both who teleported into *our* path with your little, 'somehow-bigger-on-the-inside-Harry-Potter-magic-bullshit' machine over there. So yeah, I am just going to leave you.\" He jumped into the portal. \n\nMorty continued to stare at Amy. Rick's arm reached back through the portal, grabbed Morty by his collar, and yanked him through as well."], [32, "\"*Bluuuurp*- what, what do you mean that's your spaceship? A telephone booth? You, you, you have a magical screwdriver that can fix anything and that's the best you can do? Jesus, even Morty could do better!\"\n\n\"I could?\" Came a voice from inside the ship, seeking reassurance as Rick's arm extended backwards to push him back inside. \n\n\"You don't understand,\" said The Doctor, shaking his head at the wreck while an impossibly hot blond stepped up from beside him, \"We're on the run! You see, we are being followed by Daleks!\"\n\n\"D-Daleks?\" Wretched Rick, uncapping a flask from his pocket, \"y-you mean those toasters with wheels? Boooriiiingggg.\"\n\nHe took a swig as The Doctor began to speak, aiming a kick at the remains of the phone booth. In the corner of his eye, he could see that Morty had gotten out of the ship and was now stammering to the blonde. Probably trying to steal a piece of hair for the cloning machine in the garage- he really should keep that locked more often. *Especially* after the hedgehog incident, but he was too hungover to think of that now. \n\n\"Are you driving impaired?\" Demanded The Doctor as Rick took another sip, \"No wonder you caused this wreck!\"\n\n\"Not as impaired as you buddy, wub a dub dub! Am I right, Morty?\"\n\nBut Morty wasn't listening, instead he was doing everything he could to hold on to the blonde's fleeting attention. \n\n\"Look, I'm afraid we don't have *time* for these trivialities,\" Said The Doctor, \"If we don't act soon, it will be the end of us!  And the Tardis is not in working condition.\"\n\n\"Was it ever? Rick score two! Come on Marty, let's get going. The ship has been through worse than this and I bet this guy doesn't even have insurance. I'm like, se-seventy percent sure this can get us home.\"\n\n\"Fine, Rick,\" said Morty, entering into a hug with the unenthusiastic blonde and plucking a hair behind her back, then entering the ship. It hovered and took off as The Doctor rushed after them, then paused above an odd metal contraption rapidly approaching the Tardis. A *Dalek*. \n\nRicks hand extended from the window, holding a small weapon with grease stained fingers, and a blast of green light exploded from the tip, instantly disintegrating the hunk of metal. \n\n\"Y-You're welcome!\" He shouted out the window to The Doctor, then turned back to Morty, \"Jesus, Morty, that wasn't so hard. Can you believe they extended that show more than two seasons?\"\n"], [10, "\"Goddammit, Morty,\" grumbled Rick, assessing the damage his grandson had caused to his car-like spacecraft. \n\"You really did a *buuurp* number on her this time.\" Morty raised his hands in defiance. \n\n\"M-m-me?! You were the one trying to climb into the back, Rick!\" \n\n\"Yeah, _Morty_, and while I was doing that, you were supposed to make sure we didn't crash into anything. You're en*burp*tirely to blame.\" Rick took a swig from his flask as Morty stuttered and struggled to find words to expain his side of the argument. Rick clearly couldn't care less.\n\n\"Look, Morty, it doesn't matter. We'll have this fixed up in no time. Besides, it ain't all your fault. What kind of asshole leaves their portable toilet just lyin' around on the hard shoulder, anyway?\" just as Rick finished his sentence, the door of the mysterious vessel door opened, and out stepped a young, bouncy haired man dressed in a long brown overcoat. \n\n\"The kind of asshole that wears a friggin' bow tie, I guess.\" muttered Rick.\n\n\"Excuse me, good sir. I am the Doctor. And who might you be?\"\n\n\"Rick Sanchez, and this is my dumbass grandson, Morty.\" Morty waved. \"Sorry about the mess he left your... toilet? Changing station? Masturb*buuurp*ation booth? In. He's developmentally *burp* challenged or somethin'.\" \n\nMorty's eyes widened in annoyance and disbelief.\n\n\"Rick, this guy's a c-co-complete stranger, ya know? You can't tell him private stuff like that just, willy nilly!\"\n\n\"Your grandson has a point, Mr Sanchez, that wasn't very polite. Nor is the fact that my _TARDIS_, is in quite a state of disrepair, thanks to your collective incompetence.\"\n\n\"Polite isn't in my vocabulary, Doctor Dolittle, and neither is TARDIS, for that matter. Is that some kinda acronym? Or is it a special chamber for you to let out all your tard-rage, because you're such a retard? Ha ha! Did you like my diss M-Morty?\"\n\n\"Yeah Rick that was a real- a real good diss, dawg.\" \n\nThe Doctor rolled his eyes at the pair.\n\n\"I haven't got time for this, I've got galaxies to save. How are you planning on recompensating for the damage you've caused, Mr Sanchez?\"\n\n\"PAH! Recompensate my ass. I bet the only galaxy you're gonna save is the chocolate bar your fat, British mom asked you to bring her before you got so very lost in the cold inifinite void of outer space, _Doctor_. It was *buuurp* Morty's fault anyway, he can pay for your dumb repairs.\" spittle flew from Rick's mouth and landed on the lapel of the Doctor's jacket, which was obviously the last straw. \n\n\"That's it! I have no Earthly idea how a complete ignoramus like you has managed to make it so far out here, especially with a ship like yours. What is that, a washing machine with jet engines?\"\n\n\"Don't insult my work, Doc. I'm very respected around here. As in, everywhere. I'm pretty notorious too, so I'd watch it if I were you.\"\n\n\"Hey leave him alone Rick, he's British, you'll probably kill him by accident.\"\n\n\"Good point, Morty.

The force of the impact sent waves of tremors through the earth below.\n\n\"Ahhh- ugh -ow,\" Morty grunted from behind the driver's seat of the tiny spaceship. He rubbed his forehead and blinked a few times to assess the situation.  His eyes grew wide with panic. \n\n\"Ohhhh!! Oh, jeez, Rick! I- I-I'm sorry! Ohhhh no! I- I don't know! What happened?! Where did that thing even come from?\" \n\nRick threw a wayward glance toward Morty, his eyes bloodshot and half-shut.\n\n\"Way to go, Morty,\" he began. \"You're the only person on earth who ever flew an inter-dimensional spaceship into an immobile object.\"\n\n\"We're the only two people on earth who've ever driven this thing!\" Morty shouted, throwing his hands up indignantly.  \n\n\"You're missing the point, Morty,\" Rick continued, reaching into his lab coat and withdrawing a flask.  His practiced hands unscrewed the top and popped it open in less than a second.  \"The point is, you're an idiot, and grandpa hates you.\" He took a long drink from the flask as Morty frowned and stared at the floor of the ship.\n\n\"I-If I'd been dri-*urrrp*-iving, Morty, this wouldn't have happened. But no. Some of your- because of your adolescent, uh, you know, rage, going on, your adolescent hormones, thinking now that you, you know, got some juices going on, flowing in there, now you have to take every opportunity you could possibly have to drive everything and anything anywhere. And I bl*urp*lame myself, too, Morty. I can't believe I accommodated you and your, little rage- rage juice there, Morty. And now you've rammed the pinnacle of my life's work into the side of phone booth.\"\n\nRick raised a hand as he began to continue his thought, but was interrupted by a sudden burst of bright, artificial light spilling out of the phone booth in front of them.  A tall, skinny man emerged from the front of the booth wearing a neat, brown coat which matched the color of his hair.  Underneath the coat he wore a freshly pressed white shirt and a perfectly knotted red bow tie. Behind him, a woman with long, red hair stepped out of the booth as well. She wore a plaid blouse with dark-colored slacks and a pair of boots. \n\nRick's expression grew from one of slightly annoyed boredom to bemused interest. He signaled for Morty to join him as he exited the spacecraft.  As Rick walked toward the couple exiting the phone booth, he took another look at the ship.  Rick cringed and held his face in his right hand as he saw just how extensive the damage to his ship was. He sighed and continued toward the others.\n\n\"Sorry for interrupting your cramped, weird, phone-booth sex.\"\n\n\"Rick!\" Morty shouted, looking incredulous. \n\n\"Excuse me?\" Asked the man in the bow-tie, raising an eyebrow.  \n\n\"Well I just call it like I-\" Rick's words were cut off as he caught a glimpse through the open door of the booth.  Inside was a gigantic chamber with a series of complicated-looking electronics and controls. \n\n\"Holy shit, I've seen this technology before. You're a time lord, aren't you?\" Rick asked, turning to the man in front of the booth. \n\n\"I am indeed,\" he began, smiling. \"I am the Doctor.\"\n\nRick stared blankly at him. \"Doctor of what?\" He asked.\n\n\"Just- well, 'The Doctor',\" The Doctor responded.\n\nRick's eyes narrowed. \"All right, 'Doctor', well forgive me if I don't exactly trust someone who shares the same nickname as a crack dealer without any further explanation of where the title comes from.\" He looked toward Morty, expecting that his rude comment would have prompted another angry outburst, but Morty was preoccupied with staring at the red-haired woman.\n\nThe Doctor seemed to notice as well. \"Ah-hem.\" He cleared his throat. \"And this is Amy, she is my-\"\n\n\"Hi Amy.\" Morty called out, interrupting The Doctor.\n\nEveryone stared at Morty.\n\n\"Er- hello,\" Amy replied.\n\n\"Okay. Amy and The Doctor. Great. I'm Rick, and this is Morty. He's my grandson. Now we alllll know each other,\" Rick said, once again removing his flask from his coat. \"Is your craft still operational? My dipshit grandson destroyed mine when he attempted to destroy yours.\" \n\n\"Well, I'm not sure,\" The Doctor said, removing his sonic screwdriver from his coat pocket. \n\n\"Oh, great. The deus ex machina device,\" Rick said.\n\n\"If you say so,\" The Doctor said, shrugging. He activated the device and it began to whir as he pointed it in the direction of the damaged portion of the ship.\"Call it what you will, but it's light-years ahead of anything you've got, Rick of dimension C-137.\" \n\n\"Oooooooh,\" Rick started. \"I suppose I would be impressed if you had to do more than think about what you wanted while pushing a button to achieve results. It's like the Staples button of science-fiction writing. Also, light-years are a measure of distance, not time, but what would you know? You're just a doctor.\"\n\nThe doctor stopped using the screwdriver and rolled his eyes. \"The metaphor works equally well for distance *or* time.\"\n\nRick's face settled into its natural grimace. A small amount of drool collected under his bottom lip. \"Well, while yo- *urp* ou're over there doing nothing and somehow getting what you need anyway, I'm going to collect the parts I need with my dipshit- er, grandson. C'mon Morty.\" Rick turned to walk back toward his ship.  He reached into another one of his lab coat pockets and produced his portal gun.  Firing it, a swirling, green vapor materialized in the darkness.\n\n\"Wait!\" Amy shouted, walking toward the portal. \"You've crashed into us, and now you're just going to leave us here to fix the wreck?\" \n\nRick took another swig from his flask. \"Well, I hate to correct you, Amy, but it was you both who teleported into *our* path with your little, 'somehow-bigger-on-the-inside-Harry-Potter-magic-bullshit' machine over there. So yeah, I am just going to leave you.\" He jumped into the portal. \n\nMorty continued to stare at Amy.

Kelly's involvement had begun two months before with an abrupt phonecall at 3 am, informing him of his need to prepare to depart for Ghana. \n     A last-second dodge of an abnormally (even by african standards) large pothole quickly drew him back to the task at hand. His team had accomplished their mission, the target was ablaze with local elements providing strategically positioned roadblocks to delay security services and first responders. Now all that was left was escape. He mentally ran through the plan he had memorized by heart: his team was to rendezvous with support elements in Cape Coast, a city about three hours to the west. There they would board a local fishing vessel to be delivered to a large container ship held by an NSA front company several miles offshore. They were to assume identities of tourists visiting Elmina castle, a large portuguese fort that had been used as a sort of warehouse for slaves waiting to be shipped to the new world. The irony of fleeing to freedom in a place that had spelled the beginning of slavery for so many was not lost on Sgt. Kelly. Still he couldn't fully quell the leap of joy he felt in his heart as the imposing edifice loomed into view.\n\n>In Everlasting Memory of our Ancestors\n\n>May Those Who Died Rest in Peace\n\n>May Those Who Return Find their Roots\n\n>May Humanity Never Again Perpetrate\n\n>Such Injustice Against Humanity\n\n>We The Living Vow to Uphold This *-Plaque at Elmina Castle*\n\n\nEdit: holy crap i just saw the news that this actually happened, i thought this was just an oddly specific WP hahaha", "id": "dar9pvl"}]]], "5gbwns": ["[WP] You wake up with amnesia and the person who helps you recover becomes your best friend.

My emaciated body has been through the war grounds of cancer treatments and back again, and my mind wen from hopeful to tired. I am so tired. When the doctor came into my room with what she supposed was a sympathetic face, I knew.  I politely listened as she waxed on about how I was out of options, and how that she and the rest of my team of doctors would do everything in their power to make me comfortable. I put on the correct face I suppose. The one that says my heart is breaking about my life coming to an abrupt halt, but inside I couldn\u2019t have been more elated. Did I mention how tired I was?\n\nIt had been days since that conversation. I had many family members come in and tell me tearfully that this was not the end, that I was a fighter. I nodded along with them, I had to. In my coming death, I knew that they needed me to be strong for them. It\u2019s weird I know, that they should have been strong for me. The dying always has to comfort the living, especially those of us that die slowly. After all, they are the ones left with the gap in their lives, and I get to move on. I no longer have to hurt. I lay there in my hospital bed, waiting, listening to the faint beep of the plethora of monitors that have been hooked up to my husk of a body. I was alone, finally, counting my breathes anticipating my last, when I felt that coldness, that unnatural disturbance in the air. \n\nI cracked open my eyes to find a man, who looked like many others I would find on the street. It was his eyes that captivated me, the other worldliness, the timelessness, eyes that I when I looked into them I saw my own death. I smiled, finally my time had come. Death reached out and with the back of his scarred hand stroked my cheek. I closed my eyes, preparing so separate from my body, and shuffle of this mortal coil, as they say. \n\n\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d is what I heard instead. My eyes flew back open in surprise, and I see Death standing there staring, indecision marring is face. Wasn\u2019t I supposed to be gone? Or maybe Death just likes to say something nice before you\u2019re gone? Why was he standing there looking so damned confused?\n\n\u201cUmm\u2026 excuse me, I appreciate the compliment and all, but really I\u2019m good. If we could just get this done and over with. Trust me I\u2019m ready.\u201d I say this all out in a rush. Not only because talking is a tad bit painful, but because talking to Death is not something you ever picture yourself doing.\n \nDeath takes a deep breath in, and mutters something I can\u2019t hear. He shakes his head, and looks at me and back and forth between me and the door. Finally, he strides over to the plastic sea green chair, pulls it next to my bed and sits down. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before, you see, I\u2019ve read about that this can sometimes happen in the manual, but I was pretty sure someone was pulling my leg. You know, what you call hazing now days. It hasn\u2019t happened to anybody in my department so I was sure it was a prank.\u201d He shakes his head again, and starts to fidget while staring at me with those bottomless eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? What is going on here, and what department? Look I\u2019m ready to die now ok?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to sit up, as my voice is straining in a weak attempt at a shout. I\u2019m pretty sure Death has gone off the deep end.\n\n\u201cOh, well of course you wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d he pulls at the collar of his shirt loosening his tie, while he chuckles a bit nervously. \u201cI\u2019m a Death Agent. It doesn\u2019t really matter to people of the living, but well if you show aptitude after you die you can transfer over to the bureau\u2026 oh that doesn\u2019t matter now! I\u2019ve found you!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, you found me. I\u2019m dying, so you\u2019re supposed to come here. Look I don\u2019t really know a lot on how this is supposed to work, but I don\u2019t give a fuck what you call yourself, Death or death agent, but do your damn job!\u201d I\u2019m worked up now. I\u2019m supposed to be somewhere comfortable. You know like with a halo and wings, or on my way to start another life. I don\u2019t really care about the specifics about this point, I just know I want this one to end. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d He reaches out to me, and gives me a wistful look. \nIf I had the strength I would punch him, but I don\u2019t, so I settle on a very pissed off glare. \u201cWhy, the hell not?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s you, I\u2019ve found you so now I can\u2019t take you to the other side. You\u2019re\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what I am! I am done, so done! So, get you\u2019re scythe or lay on hands me, or do whatever it is you do and get this over with.\u201d My voice is cracking, my vocal chords aren\u2019t used to anything more than a whisper\n. \nDeath, or the Death Agent sits forward, and urgently grasps my hand. \u201cListen! You want this life to end, fine. I can do that. I just can\u2019t take you to the normal other side, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d He says this with such an intensity, that his words sink in and I pause for a moment.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d is all I can manage to croak out. I am so intent on his answer, that until he looks down at our hands, mine encompassed in his, I had forgotten that it was there at all. Waiting for him to speak, I thought about our hands like this, and found it strangely comforting, like it belonged there. \n\n\u201cWhen you get your manual, there is a small part that talks about finding your souls twin. I\u2019ve never heard of it actually happening, and neither has anybody I\u2019ve known. It\u2019s one of those things that we thought was put in there just to poke fun of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, this means?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you die, you come with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere ever it is that you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly\u201d\n\nI nod my head uncertain, but if I get to die it\u2019s worth it, right? I close my eyes, and then I\u2019m standing next to Death looking down at my body. \n\n\u201cDoes this mean I get to work as a Death Agent?\u201d I\u2019m really curious to know, as I watch I team of nurses and doctors swarm over my body.  \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying! You\u2019re my partner.\u201d\n\nI look at Death very much relieved that this wasn\u2019t a fling the girl over your shoulder and carry her off to who knows where moments. After all I barely know this agent. \n\n"], [6, "We met when I was 22 years old.  He was 27 and had a smile that both enchanted me and made me feel perfectly at home, like I was supposed to be standing there, right in front of him.  Our first meeting was at a market where he worked.  I couldn\u2019t open a plastic bag to put my apples in and he came up to me and asked if I needed a hand.  He took the bag and expertly rubbed it between his fingers, gave me a bit of a smile, and blew gently between his fingers, expanding the bag and opening it up. He snapped it in the air and handed it back to me, bowing down as if I were royalty, and I was and still am under his spell.\n\n\nIt was a chance meeting, before the digital age really sunk it\u2019s teeth into dating and relationships.  There was no online profile for me to learn about him and there was no texting app for us to chat through.  Just old fashioned face to face conversation.  He courted me for several months before asking me out on a proper date and we were inseparable ever since. He continued to treat me like royalty. His queen. Always respectful, always kind, and I knew without question that I was the most important person in his life.  He was my king.  He kept me safe and warm, even in the worst of times, and let me tell you, there were a lot of them.  I both admired him and adored him.  Other men caught my eye, sure, but none could capture my heart after I met Stanley.\n\n\nHe died 2 years ago.  I knew it was coming but nothing prepared me for the emptiness his absence left in my heart.  He was 86.  We almost made it to our 60th anniversary of our first date, but a heart attack, and I suppose you, decided that his time on earth and with me had to end.  He lived for a couple of days in the ICU before another heart attack killed him.  These months without him have been difficult.  There\u2019s a constant ache in my chest that feels like a mix of anxiety and despair that, if I let it, would squeeze my chest until I could no longer breathe.  I thought I would die before him.  I\u2019ve been fighting cancer for a few years now and I can feel my body succumbing to the disease.  Always in pain, always tired.  I have a nurse now that helps me, but before Stanley died, he took care of me.  No matter how horrible I felt, that man could make me laugh.  He put on a pair of my adult diapers over his slacks one afternoon and I laughed so hard, I almost needed him to change me out of the pair I was wearing.  No one could make me laugh like he could.\n\n\nI am telling you this because despite your best efforts, you will never mean anything to me.  You whisper promises of everlasting life and no more pain as long as I return your feelings, but it won\u2019t happen.  I still don\u2019t understand why you chose me to be the object of your strange affection, but I assure you, I will never reciprocate your feelings.  You\u2019ve been visiting me for a while now and I need to ask you, how many of these visits didn\u2019t include me talking about Stanley?  Not one.  You\u2019ve taken me to far off places in my dreams and have showed me unimaginable sights that I thought only existed in fiction, but when I wake up, my thoughts are of my husband.  I have plead with you to end my life, but your selfishness has kept me suffering in the hopes that I will look at you as I looked at him.  Have you ever felt heartbreak before?  Longing?  The deep hole in your heart that can\u2019t be filled because the one you love isn\u2019t the one who loves you?  You are about to.  You are about to feel the crushing ache of unrequited love.  The sadness that floods your soul, if you have one, every time you visit me.  I will remind you every minute you keep me alive of what you will never have.  I will always be just out of your reach and mock your grade school crush, because you will never know the feeling of deep love and respect.  Keep me hostage as long as you like.  It will bring you nothing but pain.  You will feel that mix of anxiety and despair and it will build with each visit.  It will crush you if you don\u2019t keep an exhausting vigil of barriers, borders, and redirection at the helm of your heart.  It\u2019s the worst feeling in the world and I am utterly delighted to be able to make you experience it as you have made me.\n\n\nGo ahead and walk away.  Leave me here at the hospital but know that those awful feelings you are experiencing are inescapable.  They will hide in a corner at times, only to jump out at you when you least expect it and flood your soul like a sinking ship.  And when I see the sadness in  your eyes, I\u2019ll laugh.  Nothing will please me more than you see you in pain every single day.  As long as I\u2019m alive, your heart will break more with each passing hour.\n\n\nWhat?  You\u2019re not leaving now?  Don\u2019t come near me.  Don\u2019t try to hold me.  I will not embrace you ever.

I nodded along with them, I had to. In my coming death, I knew that they needed me to be strong for them. It\u2019s weird I know, that they should have been strong for me. The dying always has to comfort the living, especially those of us that die slowly. After all, they are the ones left with the gap in their lives, and I get to move on. I no longer have to hurt. I lay there in my hospital bed, waiting, listening to the faint beep of the plethora of monitors that have been hooked up to my husk of a body. I was alone, finally, counting my breathes anticipating my last, when I felt that coldness, that unnatural disturbance in the air. \n\nI cracked open my eyes to find a man, who looked like many others I would find on the street. It was his eyes that captivated me, the other worldliness, the timelessness, eyes that I when I looked into them I saw my own death. I smiled, finally my time had come. Death reached out and with the back of his scarred hand stroked my cheek. I closed my eyes, preparing so separate from my body, and shuffle of this mortal coil, as they say. \n\n\u201cYou are so beautiful,\u201d is what I heard instead. My eyes flew back open in surprise, and I see Death standing there staring, indecision marring is face. Wasn\u2019t I supposed to be gone? Or maybe Death just likes to say something nice before you\u2019re gone? Why was he standing there looking so damned confused?\n\n\u201cUmm\u2026 excuse me, I appreciate the compliment and all, but really I\u2019m good. If we could just get this done and over with. Trust me I\u2019m ready.\u201d I say this all out in a rush. Not only because talking is a tad bit painful, but because talking to Death is not something you ever picture yourself doing.\n \nDeath takes a deep breath in, and mutters something I can\u2019t hear. He shakes his head, and looks at me and back and forth between me and the door. Finally, he strides over to the plastic sea green chair, pulls it next to my bed and sits down. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before, you see, I\u2019ve read about that this can sometimes happen in the manual, but I was pretty sure someone was pulling my leg. You know, what you call hazing now days. It hasn\u2019t happened to anybody in my department so I was sure it was a prank.\u201d He shakes his head again, and starts to fidget while staring at me with those bottomless eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? What is going on here, and what department? Look I\u2019m ready to die now ok?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to sit up, as my voice is straining in a weak attempt at a shout. I\u2019m pretty sure Death has gone off the deep end.\n\n\u201cOh, well of course you wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d he pulls at the collar of his shirt loosening his tie, while he chuckles a bit nervously. \u201cI\u2019m a Death Agent. It doesn\u2019t really matter to people of the living, but well if you show aptitude after you die you can transfer over to the bureau\u2026 oh that doesn\u2019t matter now! I\u2019ve found you!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, you found me. I\u2019m dying, so you\u2019re supposed to come here. Look I don\u2019t really know a lot on how this is supposed to work, but I don\u2019t give a fuck what you call yourself, Death or death agent, but do your damn job!\u201d I\u2019m worked up now. I\u2019m supposed to be somewhere comfortable. You know like with a halo and wings, or on my way to start another life. I don\u2019t really care about the specifics about this point, I just know I want this one to end. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d He reaches out to me, and gives me a wistful look. \nIf I had the strength I would punch him, but I don\u2019t, so I settle on a very pissed off glare. \u201cWhy, the hell not?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s you, I\u2019ve found you so now I can\u2019t take you to the other side. You\u2019re\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what I am! I am done, so done! So, get you\u2019re scythe or lay on hands me, or do whatever it is you do and get this over with.\u201d My voice is cracking, my vocal chords aren\u2019t used to anything more than a whisper\n. \nDeath, or the Death Agent sits forward, and urgently grasps my hand. \u201cListen! You want this life to end, fine. I can do that. I just can\u2019t take you to the normal other side, that\u2019s the problem.\u201d He says this with such an intensity, that his words sink in and I pause for a moment.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d is all I can manage to croak out. I am so intent on his answer, that until he looks down at our hands, mine encompassed in his, I had forgotten that it was there at all. Waiting for him to speak, I thought about our hands like this, and found it strangely comforting, like it belonged there. \n\n\u201cWhen you get your manual, there is a small part that talks about finding your souls twin. I\u2019ve never heard of it actually happening, and neither has anybody I\u2019ve known. It\u2019s one of those things that we thought was put in there just to poke fun of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, this means?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you die, you come with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere ever it is that you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly\u201d\n\nI nod my head uncertain, but if I get to die it\u2019s worth it, right? I close my eyes, and then I\u2019m standing next to Death looking down at my body. \n\n\u201cDoes this mean I get to work as a Death Agent?\u201d I\u2019m really curious to know, as I watch I team of nurses and doctors swarm over my body.  \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying! You\u2019re my partner.\u201d\n\nI look at Death very much relieved that this wasn\u2019t a fling the girl over your shoulder and carry her off to who knows where moments. After all I barely know this agent. \n\n", "id": "daqvoj7"}, {"comment": "I LOVE THIS OMGGG", "id": "daqyxzh"}, {"comment": "IS THERE A PART 2?!", "id": "dar7g1m"}], [{"comment": "We met when I was 22 years old.  He was 27 and had a smile that both enchanted me and made me feel perfectly at home, like I was supposed to be standing there, right in front of him.  Our first meeting was at a market where he worked.  I couldn\u2019t open a plastic bag to put my apples in and he came up to me and asked if I needed a hand.  He took the bag and expertly rubbed it between his fingers, gave me a bit of a smile, and blew gently between his fingers, expanding the bag and opening it up. He snapped it in the air and handed it back to me, bowing down as if I were royalty, and I was and still am under his spell.\n\n\nIt was a chance meeting, before the digital age really sunk it\u2019s teeth into dating and relationships.  There was no online profile for me to learn about him and there was no texting app for us to chat through.  Just old fashioned face to face conversation.  He courted me for several months before asking me out on a proper date and we were inseparable ever since. He continued to treat me like royalty. His queen. Always respectful, always kind, and I knew without question that I was the most important person in his life.  He was my king.  He kept me safe and warm, even in the worst of times, and let me tell you, there were a lot of them.  I both admired him and adored him.  Other men caught my eye, sure, but none could capture my heart after I met Stanley.\n\n\nHe died 2 years ago.  I knew it was coming but nothing prepared me for the emptiness his absence left in my heart.  He was 86.  We almost made it to our 60th anniversary of our first date, but a heart attack, and I suppose you, decided that his time on earth and with me had to end.  He lived for a couple of days in the ICU before another heart attack killed him.  These months without him have been difficult.  There\u2019s a constant ache in my chest that feels like a mix of anxiety and despair that, if I let it, would squeeze my chest until I could no longer breathe.  I thought I would die before him.  I\u2019ve been fighting cancer for a few years now and I can feel my body succumbing to the disease.  Always in pain, always tired.  I have a nurse now that helps me, but before Stanley died, he took care of me.  No matter how horrible I felt, that man could make me laugh.  He put on a pair of my adult diapers over his slacks one afternoon and I laughed so hard, I almost needed him to change me out of the pair I was wearing.  No one could make me laugh like he could.\n\n\nI am telling you this because despite your best efforts, you will never mean anything to me.  You whisper promises of everlasting life and no more pain as long as I return your feelings, but it won\u2019t happen.  I still don\u2019t understand why you chose me to be the object of your strange affection, but I assure you, I will never reciprocate your feelings.  You\u2019ve been visiting me for a while now and I need to ask you, how many of these visits didn\u2019t include me talking about Stanley?  Not one.  You\u2019ve taken me to far off places in my dreams and have showed me unimaginable sights that I thought only existed in fiction, but when I wake up, my thoughts are of my husband.  I have plead with you to end my life, but your selfishness has kept me suffering in the hopes that I will look at you as I looked at him.  Have you ever felt heartbreak before?  Longing?  The deep hole in your heart that can\u2019t be filled because the one you love isn\u2019t the one who loves you?  You are about to.  You are about to feel the crushing ache of unrequited love.  The sadness that floods your soul, if you have one, every time you visit me.  I will remind you every minute you keep me alive of what you will never have.  I will always be just out of your reach and mock your grade school crush, because you will never know the feeling of deep love and respect.  Keep me hostage as long as you like.  It will bring you nothing but pain.  You will feel that mix of anxiety and despair and it will build with each visit.  It will crush you if you don\u2019t keep an exhausting vigil of barriers, borders, and redirection at the helm of your heart.  It\u2019s the worst feeling in the world and I am utterly delighted to be able to make you experience it as you have made me.\n\n\nGo ahead and walk away.  Leave me here at the hospital but know that those awful feelings you are experiencing are inescapable.  They will hide in a corner at times, only to jump out at you when you least expect it and flood your soul like a sinking ship.  And when I see the sadness in  your eyes, I\u2019ll laugh.  Nothing will please me more than you see you in pain every single day.  As long as I\u2019m alive, your heart will break more with each passing hour.\n\n\nWhat?  You\u2019re not leaving now?  Don\u2019t come near me.  Don\u2019t try to hold me.  I will not embrace you ever.

Like I said, Jerry Lawfonda was a man who strode with purpose and determination; once he had decided his course, there was no swaying him.\n\nAnd so, like old sandpaper being rubbed onto fresh metal, the media gathered hungrily around the president elect, Jerry Lawfonda. A bible, sturdy and well worn, was presented to the great man to be. A firm hand was placed on the bible. A stern, steady look was held on Jerry\u2019s firm face. A deep, masculine voice escaped the lips of Jerry Lawfonda. His voice, just like his will of steel and his grip of iron, was envied by countless men as they watched Lawfonda from across the nation.

I opened my eyes to find David and Jeff looking at me.\n\n\"So?\" Jeff asked. \"What happened to you guys?\"\n\n\"Demons!\" David muttered. \"Stapling my nuts to everything they could find, I can't believe my luck!\"\n\n\"How about you?\" I asked of Jeff.\n\n\"Man, it was just the most smokin' babe, and she was goin' down on me! You?\"\n\n\"Nothing, I must have gotten a bad one.\"\n\n\"Damn dude, that sucks.\" Jeff looked to the bag. \"Shame we only got three, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah, don't sweat it.\" I stood, grabbing my belongings. \"Anyways, I've gotta go home. I'll see you guys later.\"\n\nThe walk home was nothing special; on the way, I stopped at the gas station to buy cigarettes and lotto tickets; naturally, the ones from last night were nothing special. When I got home, my cat was sitting on my bed; I petted her gingerly before going to bed.\n\nThe next morning, I went to my job at the warehouse. My luck was never spectacular, and as fate would have it, my forklift experienced a fault, slamming the pallet of televisions into the ground, breaking them and knocking the shelf they were on over. Again, as luck would have it, when my supervisor came to check out the problem, and I told him my machine broke, he managed to make it work perfectly. He fired me, and told me that my wages for the past month would be garnished to pay for the damage.\n\nOn the way home, I stopped at the gas station. I got another pack of cigarettes and lotto tickets. When I cashed the first one, it was a jackpot; I couldn't believe my luck. The second was, as well. As was the third, and the fourth, and the fifth.\n\n\"Wow, you must be the luckiest guy on Earth!\" the cashier shouted, shaking me with joy.\n\n\"Oh fuck,\" I muttered. \"This is fake, isn't it?\"\n\nThe cashier raised a brow.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I took Dragons yesterday, this must be the wrong universe!\"\n\n\"Kid, what are you talking about?\"\n\n\"I... I gotta go spend this money!\"\n\n\"I would invest it, but hey, that's just me. I mean, you did get like two billion.\"\n\nSeveral days later, and the dream still hadn't worn off. I had cashed in my money, and hopped state lines. No point in giving Jeff or David any, since the dream would wear off soon. My first stop was Vegas: I blew a hundred million in gambling and whores, drugs and cars. I purchased the premier penthouse downtown, and would often invite celebrities to hang out. Of course, none did, but the point was that I could.\n\nI then took a tour across the national parks of America. Gambling had worn me out, and I tired of it. I wanted to see what the world looked like. The Grand Canyon, the Everglades, what a trip! The world was much better than I imagined. I would have never gone to Vegas if I knew this was the beauty it held.\n\nAfter that, I sensed that the trip was almost over. I settled in California, in a small cottage on the ocean. The beach was stunning, the white sand between my toes was divine. I frequented the orphanages and hospitals around, bought toys and payed off medical debt. The thanks they gave me put a warmth in my heart. Whenever I woke up for real, I would have to stop wasting money. I would go to school, get a real job, and try for this lifestyle. In a strange turn of events, philanthropy was a better drug than cocaine and heroin; perhaps the first time ever, or ever to come, that winning the lottery turned an addict into a respectable human being. I had to try.\n\nEventually, I was down to my last few million. I began to get suspicious; it had already been ten years, a year longer than the lengthiest trip ever recorded. What if it wasn't a dream? What if fortune had really turned a kind eye to me? I was approaching fifty, and I still didn't have anyone to love.\n\nI began dating. I never told anyone of my wealth, lest I attract golddiggers, but that didn't stop a few from recognizing my name from the news; after all, 'Biggest Lotto Winner of the Century' tends to catch a lot of attention. In the end, I found Sarah, the kindest soul on the Earth. It was as if she and I were perfect together.\n\nWe married in six months, and had two beautiful boys. As time went on, I paid for the finest learning institutions, and they went to Berkeley for engineering. At their graduation, I felt a sudden pain in my chest; I collapsed, shouting 'No!' as loud as I could. I didn't want this to end.\n\nI awoke in the hospital; I was experiencing total organ failure, and they gave me less than a week to live.\n\n\"I suppose my time is over,\" I told my wife. \"I only wished I could have lived this longer.\"\n\nI held her hand, and she and my boys watched as I breathed my last.\n\nI awoke in a trashy living room, and two men that I barely recognized were looking at me.\n\n\"Jeff? David?\" I muttered.\n\n\"So?\" Jeff asked. \"What happened to you guys?\"\n\n\"Demons!\" David muttered. \"Stapling my nuts to everything they could find, I can't believe my luck!\"\n\n\"How about you?\" I asked of Jeff.\n\n\"Man, it was just the most smokin' babe, and she was goin' down on me!

I'll see you guys later.\"\n\nThe walk home was nothing special; on the way, I stopped at the gas station. I stared at the wall of cigarettes, and at the flashing lotto signs. I purchased a large slushee; naturally, the previous night's lotto tickets didn't give me anything. I walked home. When I got there, my cat was expectantly sitting on my bed. I cuddled her for half an hour and gave her extra food, before going to bed.\n\nThe next morning, I went to my job at the warehouse. My luck was never spectacular, and as fate would have it, my forklift experienced a fault. This time, however, the pallet of televisions was unbalanced; I had secured it incorrectly in my haste.\n\nThe heavy load fell backwards, knocking me to the ground and crushing me. As I felt the blood pooling beneath me, I laughed.\n\n\"Jesus Christ!\" my supervisor shouted, calling for help. By the time they lifted the boxes off of me, I felt faint.\n\n\"What a life,\" I muttered. I barely managed to fish the apartment keys from my pocket, tossing them to my supervisor. \"Make sure someone takes care of my cat.\"\n\n\"Come on, we're getting you to the hospital!\"\n\nThey never did. At least I would be with Sarah."]], [[{"comment": "\"Alright, on three!\" I spoke, excited; Jeff, David, and I had just acquired a small supply of Vacuum Dragons, supposedly the craziest drug on the market.\n\"One... two... three!\" Jeff counted.

I vaguely recognized the voice. A shadow appeared and a light flickered on. Immediately I knew why I recognized the voice. I know that jawline and tall head anywhere. \n\"The United States thanks you for your sacrifice,\" Secretary of State John Kerry told me. A gunshot rang through the cell. I fell to my knees, and looked at the blood pooling out of my stomach. I felt the warm blanket of death flow over me and my eyes being to waver. \n\nAs my eyes shut for the final time, my last sight of this world was Hong and Kerry looking on as a Chinese soldier tortured Qin and berated him in a language I'd never quite heard before.\n"]], [[{"comment": "When I first saw Qin, I didn't recognize him.

Then, I followed him across an unlit, echoey hallway and into a dank cell. \n\nThe cell door shut behind me with a clang. I turned to see Gwen and the two officers slumped against the wall.\n\"Hey!\" \n\"I am sorry, Mr. Donovan. This happens sometimes.\" The voice wasn't Hong's. It was an American. I vaguely recognized the voice. A shadow appeared and a light flickered on. Immediately I knew why I recognized the voice. I know that jawline and tall head anywhere. \n\"The United States thanks you for your sacrifice,\" Secretary of State John Kerry told me. A gunshot rang through the cell. I fell to my knees, and looked at the blood pooling out of my stomach. I felt the warm blanket of death flow over me and my eyes being to waver. \n\nAs my eyes shut for the final time, my last sight of this world was Hong and Kerry looking on as a Chinese soldier tortured Qin and berated him in a language I'd never quite heard before.\n", "id": "darb8qa"}]]], "5gb36i": ["[IP] They Say If He Only Had A Faster Pitch...", "2016-12-03 22:01:42", 3, "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5gb36i/ip_they_say_if_he_only_had_a_faster_pitch/", [], []], "5g9z27": ["[WP] In a world where nothing bad ever happens, cars flow around each other without hitting, fire isn't dangerous, ect.

It was a terrible attempt, the accent sounding more russian than german, but it would have to do.\n\nThe coffin shuddered, dust shaking off it. It hadn't moved in decades, the dust and rubble from the bombings still exactly where they had fallen. The coffin door sprung open violently as the occupant kicked it open, emerging into the UV light.\n\t\n\u201cYou are not Goebbels,\u201d he hissed.\n\t\n\u201cNo,\u201d Neeson shook his head. He tensed, hand ready to reach for his weapon,\n\t\n\u201cThen who are you, and why have you awakened me?\u201d vampire Hitler hissed, baring his fangs.\n\t\n\u201cI'm the realest motherfucker that you ever saw,\u201d Neeson spat, and drew his shotgun from behind his back. \u201cAnd I need your time machine.\u201d\n\t\nHitler laughed, a long, raspy chuckle, his throat only having the vague memory of water. He slapped the shotgun from Neeson's hand and shook his head.\n\t\n\u201cNo, if we are too fight, young one, it will be the right way,\u201d Hitler insisted. \u201cBut I see no need for that now. My time machine never worked, it will do you no good. Now leave me to my rest.\u201d\n\t\nNeeson gritted his teeth as Hitler turned to reenter the coffin. He hadn't come this far to give up now. He needed his daughter back.\n\t\n\u201cThey forgot about you, you know?\u201d he yelled after Hitler. The vampire stopped and turned around, one foot hovering over the coffin.\n\t\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he hissed. In... shock? Incredulity? Neeson wasn't sure.\n\t\n\u201cYeah. I knew your plan. Go into hiding for a thousand years, then come out when the time was right, when they'd need you again, wasn't it? Well it's not going to work, you're a footnote!\u201d\n\t\nHitler strode over to him, purposefully. In his eyes was the fire that had so captivated a nation. A vampire's magic.\n\t\n\u201cI killed millions!\u201d he glared Neeson in the eyes, sending a chill down his spine. A lesser man would've shat himself. An even lesser man would've crumpled on the spot. But Neeson wasn't just any man, he was a certified badass who couldn't keep good track of his family.\n\t\n\u201cAnd no one cares,\u201d he said, the two men face to face.\n\t\n\u201cNot even my country?\u201d he asked.\n\t\n\u201cThey loathe you,\u201d he answered. This, at least, was true.\n\t\n\u201cAll these little ingrates... who do you think helped mold them all?\u201d his face softened a little, an old man coming to terms with his legacy. Neeson saw a little of himself in there, and he wasn't sure if empathy for Hitler was something he really wanted to be feeling.\n\t\n\u201cWe can try to use the time machine,\u201d Hitler finally said. \u201cAnd I'll go back and make things right.\u201d\n\t\nNeeson nodded, but that line genuinely scared the crap out of him.\n\t\nThe two men made their way down the corridors of the Fuhrer bunker, Hitler taking a moment to pay his respects to his wife and dog.\n\t\n\u201cI don't know how you plan to use the time machine,\u201d Hitler began fiddling with the device, a huge metal ring with panels all over it. He was surprised the Nazis had acccess to this kind of technology, even the glass panels were ahead of their time.\n\t\n\u201cWhen we last tried to use it, we had to kill millions for fuel, and even then we weren't succesful,\u201d he pulled and twisted at the inner workings of the machine.\n\t\n\u201cBecause it never needed it,\u201d Neeson shrugged, pulling out a small tube from his jacket.\n\t\n\u201cWhat... you mean-\u201d Hitler stuttered.\t\n\t\n\u201cHimmler tricked you,\u201d Neeson said, simply. He had no time to deal with Hitler's emotions right now.\n\t\n\u201cAdolf Hitler is no puppet,\u201d he hissed, angrily.\n\t\n\u201cDeny the truth more, sure,\u201d he slipped the tube into the side of the ring. \u201cBecause that's worked out so well for you.\u201d\n\nThe tube was radioactive material, but he doubted a vampire needed to worry about that. And Neeson figured, after all the shit he'd been through, he didn't have to worry about dying of radiation poisoning. That was the least of his worries.\n\t\n\u201cNow, if you'll excuse me, I have to save my daughter,\u201d he told Hitler, as the portal began to swirl with crackling blue energy.\n\t\n\u201cI'm coming with you,\u201d Hitler said, after a short pause.\n\t\n\u201cDon't you have things to do?\u201d he asked.\n\t\n\u201cHm... no. I must... redeem myself first.\u201d\n\t\nNeeson sighed. Genocidal dictator on a quest for redemption? He'd complain about the cliche, but he was hardly free from that, either.\n\t\n\u201cBadly written cliche one, meet badly written cliche two,\u201d he muttered. Hitler looked at him strangely, but said nothing more.\n\t\n\u201cYou don't know what we're fighting,\u201d Neeson said.\n\t\n\u201cLittle is beyond my capabilities,\u201d Hitler declared.\n\t\nNeeson waited a little, wondering how to explain the entity that had come for his daughter this time. It had started with the human traffickers, sure, but it soon escalated to stereotypical Italian mobsters, then ancient storm gods, and now...\n\t\n\u201cAlien dragon cowboys with health bars,\u201d he cut to the chase.\n\t\n\u201cAlien... what?\u201d Hitler stared at him in confusion.\n\t\n\u201cYeah, I don't know what health bars are either, something about video games?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhat's a video game?\u201d Hitler peered at him.\n\t\n\u201cI'm not sure, but I'm going to wing it,\u201d he glanced at the portal again. The scene within it cleared, to show some plains. Horses galloped in the distance, kicking up storms of dust, as the sun began to set.\n\t\nNeeson raised his shotgun again, as he walked into the portal, Hitler following closely behind him. A different world, but the mechanics of combat were always the same.\n\t\nHe punctuated his musings by firing a shower of pellets into a passing alien. It squinted at him, unimpressed, as the number above his head went from 100 to 70.\n\t\n\u201cHitler?\u201d Neeson asked.\n\t\n\u201cYes?\u201d he inquired.\n\t\n\u201cPerhaps we should run,\u201d he proposed.\n\t\n\u201cIndeed, that may be wise,\u201d Hitler agreed, as they both stared at the alien.\n\t\nThe two didn't stop running until the sun fully set.", "id": "daqfr1t"}, {"comment": "I'm actually really impressed.", "id": "daqg1la"}, {"comment": "I know, right? \n\n/u/poiyurt, that was great!

The footsteps of the approaching army could be heard, but they remained hidden from sight amongst the mountains. Large barriers and long pikes formed a spiked wall covering three hundred yards across. Soldiers lay in wait, guns loaded and on fire. Captain Joxy held his hand in the air. When it fell, the soldiers would fire, like a well oiled machine. Deaths were estimated to be in the thousands. Everyone knew danger lay around the corner. Everyone knew they were likely to die. Everyone knew that they were humanity's first line of defense. Everyone steeled their nerves and waited. The time would soon come. The booming and ever present sound of possibly thousands of footsteps pounded ever closer, always seeming to be one step away, one inch away, but they ever went on. The suspense alone was enough to kill all the men, but they steeled their nerves. Trebuchets were to the rear of humanity's hope, ready to launch ninety kilogram objects over three hundred meters. Tanks lay closer, ready to fire their cannons and explosive shells. Sand bags reinforced the walls, and the infantry filled in the rest. The armies of Armageddon grew closer. Suddenly, the sound changed. The footsteps were bright and clear as day as opposed to the duller and slightly muffled sound the humans have gotten used to. It was almost time. Captain Joxy prepared to lower his hand. The armies approached. The sound grew louder. The first sight of the enemies were seen. \"Arms ready!\" The soldiers adjusted their weapons to the ready. \"Hold! On my count!\" Joxy yelled. They were nearing. \"One!\" The wall began to shake. \"Two!\" The first concrete barriers fell. And in poured... Kittens? What seemed like millions of kittens filtered through the cracks in the walls, each kitten wearing what looked like battle armor. They were rather cute, to be fair. Joxy was so surprised that the armies of the Apocalypse were so cute and fuzzy that he didn't finish his count. The soldiers were confused, without direction, shocked. One soldier raised his fist and punched himself in his confusion. Another fired, without order, freaking out. The shot brought Joxy back to the world. \"Fire! Fire, God dammit!\" Shots rang out, hundreds of bullets flying over each other and embedding themselves into the cats. The tanks began to fire their explosive shells, the trebuchets firing last. Massive explosions blew massive craters in the land, blowing up hundreds of kittens. The doombringers were layered so thick that each shot was guaranteed a hit. Ninety kilogram boulders smashed into the kittens and rolled down them, crushing even more. Blood ran thick in the enemy's countless numbers. But for each one they killed, it seemed that ten replaced them. Soon the kittens reached the armies of humanity. They began to jump and scratch, hanging on to the soldiers restricting their movement. Several soldiers ran back, but were still overcome by the faster cats. Those kitties attacked like piranhas, viciously tearing apart the humans. Several of them hung on top the soldiers' faces, suffocating them by closing off their air access. The tanks were invaded by men trying to escape the doom, but they only brought in more kittens and death. The armies of humanity were overcome. Joxy somehow survived. Amidst the chaos, he found his way into a tank and killed the cats that followed him in before they killed him. The tank had three dead bodies, those of humans. Blood and sweat ran down Joxy's face, his leg bleeding out on the floor. He breathed heavily and quickly, his heart pounding his chest. He heard the scratches of cat claws against the metal of his tank. He heard the screams of humans as more of them died. Joxy curled into a ball and began to cry heavily. He sobbed and sobbed. The gray sky never changed."]], [[{"comment": "\"Sir, may I have a word?\" The sergeant spoke to the captain, in his private tent. The world outside was gray, the atmosphere grim.

Suddenly, the sound changed. The footsteps were bright and clear as day as opposed to the duller and slightly muffled sound the humans have gotten used to. It was almost time. Captain Joxy prepared to lower his hand. The armies approached. The sound grew louder. The first sight of the enemies were seen. \"Arms ready!\" The soldiers adjusted their weapons to the ready. \"Hold! On my count!\" Joxy yelled. They were nearing. \"One!\" The wall began to shake. \"Two!\" The first concrete barriers fell. And in poured... Kittens? What seemed like millions of kittens filtered through the cracks in the walls, each kitten wearing what looked like battle armor. They were rather cute, to be fair. Joxy was so surprised that the armies of the Apocalypse were so cute and fuzzy that he didn't finish his count. The soldiers were confused, without direction, shocked. One soldier raised his fist and punched himself in his confusion. Another fired, without order, freaking out. The shot brought Joxy back to the world. \"Fire! Fire, God dammit!\" Shots rang out, hundreds of bullets flying over each other and embedding themselves into the cats. The tanks began to fire their explosive shells, the trebuchets firing last. Massive explosions blew massive craters in the land, blowing up hundreds of kittens. The doombringers were layered so thick that each shot was guaranteed a hit. Ninety kilogram boulders smashed into the kittens and rolled down them, crushing even more. Blood ran thick in the enemy's countless numbers. But for each one they killed, it seemed that ten replaced them. Soon the kittens reached the armies of humanity. They began to jump and scratch, hanging on to the soldiers restricting their movement. Several soldiers ran back, but were still overcome by the faster cats. Those kitties attacked like piranhas, viciously tearing apart the humans. Several of them hung on top the soldiers' faces, suffocating them by closing off their air access. The tanks were invaded by men trying to escape the doom, but they only brought in more kittens and death. The armies of humanity were overcome. Joxy somehow survived. Amidst the chaos, he found his way into a tank and killed the cats that followed him in before they killed him. The tank had three dead bodies, those of humans. Blood and sweat ran down Joxy's face, his leg bleeding out on the floor. He breathed heavily and quickly, his heart pounding his chest. He heard the scratches of cat claws against the metal of his tank. He heard the screams of humans as more of them died. Joxy curled into a ball and began to cry heavily. He sobbed and sobbed.

Since my Facebook was clogged by everyone, and their uncle, writing on my wall, or tagging me, I started a blog. The first thing I did was to layout my the rules.

I was saving the world after all, I didn't think it was too much to ask for."], [1, "Even growing up as  a child in a middle-class American family, I never did ever relate to, nor did I particularly like, anyone with whom I had ever interacted.  This general refusal to interact with anybody else of the same species was generally comfortable, and nobody had any problems reciprocating, which was all I could have wished for.  My childhood consisted of nothing more than hours of perusing countless novels (of which only the lengthiest took me any sort of time to finish), and thus my bedroom in a rather typical suburban American household gradually filled up with material of my choosing.  \n\nUnsurprisingly, school was not a particularly enjoyable experience for me; to me, seven hours a day of keeping my head down and avoiding the more rambunctious students (if, given their apparent disdain for the implications of such a title, they can rightfully be called 'students') was nothing more than a waste of my time, which, I believe, could have been spent much more effectively through my own pursuits.\n\nOverall, I never was one to seek (or gain) attention, and that kept everyone perfectly happy, and save a few like-minded friends and my family (several members of which never ceased to annoy me), no one even knew that I existed.  This pattern continued through the entirety of my childhood, and I fully expected it to last through the rest of my life (which, due to this perfectly likable lifestyle, would ideally pass at a relaxed pace and come to a gentle end with me at a satisfyingly old age).\n\nNothing that I had been taught, both in school or through my own studies, could have in any way prepared me for this horrifically drastic turn of events, nor could even my imagination have produced anything even remotely close to this level of magnitude.  \n\nThe announcement came just over a week ago -- that the entire world had been infected with an unforeseeable and unstoppable form of bacteria.  This in itself was unbelievable to much of  the world's population, and thus they continued on with life as usual.  They were shocked, then, when all of the governments of the world set mandates that required every citizen of the world to visit their nearest hospital and undergo a simple blood test; which, most of the scientists of the world had concluded, would be the simplest way to determine whether or not anyone in the world had naturally occurring antibodies to this infection.  If anyone was shown to be resistant, this would speed up the development of an artificial cure exponentially.  \n\nJust a few minutes after staring slack-jawed in disbelief at the television, my parents, with whom I had experienced very little voluntary interaction in the past few years, grabbed myself and my two siblings and began the two-minute journey to our neighboring hospital.  \n\nWhen we arrived, the large building was already swarming with people desperate to be tested as well as the insufficiently small team of nurses attempting (rather unsuccessfully) to create an organized system to maximize efficiency.  After about ten minutes of everybody milling around looking for an unoccupied doctor or examination room, those attempting to make order managed to get everybody into lines -- which, at this point, ran on quite a ways past the doors -- to each room, where each person would be tested one at a time.  \n\nIt took perhaps thirty minutes for my family to reach the front of one of the lines, and after a few minutes more, I stepped into the examination.  The doctor had a slightly twisted look on her face, as if she had made up her mind to be calm but couldn't quite accomplish the feat, but she was quite fast about obtaining the sample.  I was (in a not particularly gentle fashion) forced onto the cushioned bed, at which point she jabbed a hastily sterilized needle into my forearm (the world, I suppose, isn't worried about infections of the 'curable' type).  As I was removed from the room, I caught a glimpse of my blood, about which it had never occurred to me that there might be something special, being carefully placed into a centrifuge.  As I was pushed out of the way by the next person (who was muttering some choice expletives at my dawdling) and back into the mass of people, an overwhelming sense of helplessness came over me.\n\nSimply being around so many other humans often made me anxious, but this was something peculiarly potent; I inexplicably began feeling as if I was responsible for everyone within the room and that there was nothing I could possible do to save all of them.  The feeling passed quickly, and I rejoined my family shortly after being jostled by the entire population of my city; yet for the rest of the day, I could not shake the feeling that something even larger was about to happen.\n\nThe next two days passed rather uneventfully; the world sat in silence, every family gathered around their television, hoping for any ounce of hope that accompanied a discovery.  At the very end of that second day, it seemed that the world was slowly giving up its belief in the possibility of a cure, and this was apparent just on the faces of all I saw.  The man giving consistent updates (none of which were promising) on the television became more and more tired as the day went on; his suit, which had been crisply pressed that morning, gradually attained countless lines, as did his face.\n\nThe announcement came at approximately one o'clock in the morning of the third day, leaving the world in awe.  Of everyone who had been tested (which was estimated to have been over 4/5 of the world's population), only one individual had been found to have a resistance to this strain.  That person was me.\n\nAt first, I refused to believe that it could possibly have been me, seeing as how there must be countless people with the same name, but it became obvious that I was about to be in over my head when the doctor who had tested me came to our front door.  After a couple of heavy knocks, my mother stood up and let her in.\n\nThe doctor now wore simply an expression of disbelief, and she proceeded to explain that out of seven billion people, I was the sole person with this trait and that I was essentially humanity's only hope for survival.  From there, she stated that given its current course, the disease would likely exterminate the population of the earth within six months -- all dead, except me.  \n\nAccording those leading the development of a cure, however, it may take significantly longer than those six months to get a working treatment.  In the meantime, the only way to become immune to the infection is through interaction with the sole immune individual.\n\nAt this point, I was simply unable to comprehend the importance of this, and I had it difficult to even believe that this was anything more than just a massive joke being played on the world.  I can assure you; it is not.\n\nJust a few hours later, the knowledge that I was the potential savior of the human race and that one could become safe simply by interacting with me became public.  Within minutes, there was a steady stream of neighbors showing up at the door, and after a few more, people from the city itself were coming in hordes.  \n\nThis was too much for me to handle, and in a sudden fit of panic, I dashed upstairs to my place of refuge.  Only with my books surrounding me did I feel any sort of peace, and my whirling mind slowly came to reason and began thinking logically about the situation.\n\nI had six months to attempt to save as many people as possible -- 180 days.  Of course, there is no way to meet every single citizen of the planet within that span of time, or even in the span of my lifetime.  How then, must a teenager who has had, for the majority of his life, very limited experience with other people decide which people may live and which may die?  How can someone previously unknown to all but a select few within a few minutes' time become the most well-known person on the planet?\n\nEven now, my mind is still trying to make sense of it all.  I suppose I will have to form some rather severe criteria, but already I fear that I will let my unconscious biases somehow decimate the human race -- that I, having been given the chance to save as many people as I can, might somehow screw it up for all of us.\n\nI've never been religious, but right now, some spiritual guidance would certainly be gratefully received. . . \n\n\nCan't finish this right now (almost 2 AM), but I will if I feel up to it tomorrow.  See how well this goes for my first attempt.  \n\n "], [1, "A week ago I would usually get messages from the same two people, my mother, her new boyfriend to pick up some food from the corner store.

A slim, old man came in, hollow eyes deep in his skull, smiling through his lying teeth. \n\n\"Good day, friend,\" he said, \"how's it going?\"\n\nI just kept looking forward, sucking my lower lip, smiling at the nice gentleman in front of me, barely acknowledging the gun in his hand. He never smiled; his face was blank. If he nodded, I answered. If he shook his head, I ignored.\n\nHis nose moved, ever so slightly. Left, right, left, right.\n\n*Sorry, Bill.*"], [1, "Roger was at the very least a bit of a dick. I'd only known him three minutes but I didn't like him. I was in Egypt with my dad and his new girlfriend Sarah, we were seeing the sights by getting a burger with a beautiful view of the pyramids. Mom got custody when they split so I didn't see much of my dad, which was a shame but probably worked out great for him, he was never around much anyway. Roger had sat down at the table next to ours, flicking some table shit onto the floor. Roger started eating, and I didn't see him; I heard him. It was gross, might actually make you gag and throw up gross. I didn't want to look at him in case the action matched the visceral noise pollution that was infecting my very being. So forgive me but I really didn't like Roger. \n\n\"Dad can I go outside?\"\n\n\"What why? I'm not done eating.\" \n \nObviously he hadn't noticed and/or wasn't affected by the disgusting display next to us. \n\n\"I just..\" A loud CRAAACK interrupted me and the restaurant shook. I grew up where earthquakes were common enough, so my table went into quake mode. \n\n\"Earthquake, hold on!!\" Dad wasnt worried, he always kept a serious but relaxed attitude to quakes. \"Not a biggie.\" He smiled as the quake died away and I noticed Roger flailing around on the floor yelping like a small  but fat dog that was stranded on a small beach. Dad went to help him up after checking on Sarah, who had kept her cool actually. As dad got Roger back into a chair I looked out the window at the pyramids.. \"uhhh, dad?!\" \n\n                               ***\n\nThe sky had turned a deep red, cracking with lightning and the clouds were swirling around the pyramids faster than I had ever seen clouds move before, it felt unnatural. A shiver went down my spine and I looked at dad, and he was not the calm and collected guy I had known my whole life. Sheer terror was plastered all over his face, and it frightened me to the core. I was frozen in place with fear. \n\n\"We're going. NOW!\" My dad sounded so scared in that moment we said nothing and just followed him. We got outside and felt lost. We had planned to see the pyramids and had no plans to get back to the hotel. Was it ok to go back to the hotel? A loud thunderous noise erupted like a sound volcano so loud it made me jump. We turned to look at the pyramids, where everything seemed to be going on. \n\n\"It's the pyramids!\" My dad was shouting as the wind whipped up around us, I grabbed onto his arm just in case the storm got out of hand, at this point I was basically reduced to my base emotions, there was no longer a thinking human being, just survival instincts and the very high potential of wetting my pants. He was right though. We looked out at the pyramids and it was like the heavens had opened up, except heaven was on fire or something. \n\n\"I've got a car, let's go!\" Roger was with us and he did in fact have a car. He opened the door to a luxury executive looking four door car, I looked at my dad like, are we going with this guy? And he looked at me the same way, and together we like psychically agreed we should probably totally definitely get in the car and get the fudge out of dodge. We got into the car, Roger driving, dad in front and me and Sarah in the back. As we pulled out of the parking lot I could see people freaking out all around us. It was completely surreal. \n\n\"Seatbelts!\" Dad said, which was funny cause it was mom who always fussed about seatbelts growing up. Mine was already on, the habit ingrained deeply in my being. \n\n\"I'm Roger.\" \n\n\"Hi Dennis. This is my daughter and this is Sarah.\" My dad made the introductions quickly. \n\n\"We can't get through here.\" \n\n\"Try down that way, it looks clearer.\" As my dad navigated with Roger I felt helpless. I kept an eye on the sky around the pyramids, we seemed to be getting a bit closer to it actually. \n\n\"Daaad?\" People were screaming and running everywhere, it was total chaos on the streets. Suddenly a car swerved in front of us hit another, I heard the crash more than I saw it, but Roger swerved and went off the road. I was flung from side to side, and Sarah fell against me hard, she wasn't wearing her seatbelt, when we straightened out and slowed down she changed that quickly but my head was still throbbing from the hit. \n\n\"Everyone ok?\" Dad turned around to look at us, I smiled meekly and tried to say something but couldn't. The world was still going crazy outside the car and suddenly it was being hit by someone. A couple of people were trying to open the doors to the car. \n\n\"Fuck!\" Roger Yelled as someone opened his door and started clawing at him. \n\n\"They're trying to get in, DRIVE!!\" Roger put his foot down and we sped forwards hitting something which cracked the windscreen. The car broke through a fence and then another as we sped up and turned a corner. Roger kept his foot down and we got back on a very packed road. I could hear things as we hit them, some small sounds like a wing mirror or something and others were much worse hits. \n\n\"Stop!\" My dad was shouting and I couldn't make it all out. I just wanted to get out of there and I felt like I was going to die. And then I almost did as Roger ploughed into the side of a truck. \n\n                                ***\n\nWhy the hell did we get into the car with that gross guy again? Oh yeah the world was ending. I didn't pass out but I felt like I did. The car was full of dust, and there was now a high-pitched sound accompanying the end of times sound outside the car. \n\n\"Dad?\" I rubbed my eyes even though they weren't blurry. I looked at Sarah who was shaking next to me. \"Are you OK.\" \n\nShe smiled a little back. \"Sure. Fine.\" She didn't sound it. \n\n\"Dad?\" He didn't respond. \n\n\"Dennis?\" Sarah took her belt off and moved forward between the seats blocking me. \n\n\"Dad are you OK? Is he ok?'\" I pulled at my belt and tried to undo it. In my panic it took me a minute. I opened the car door and jumped out. I fell down immediately, like the crash had knocked my gravity controls out. I stayed down for a beat, as my head swayed. I got up and went to dad's car door and opened it. \n\n\"Dad?\" \n\n\"I'm OK.\" I hugged him, relief washing over me. \"We've got to go.\" I let go and he got out. There was a cut spilling blood from his head. \n\n\"Your head?!\" \n\n\"It's ok. I'm fine, we can't go that way.\"  Black smoke filled the sky ahead from a fire somewhere. \n\n\"This way.\" \n\n\"What about Roger?\" Why did I say that? My dad turned and went to check him. Sarah looked completely destroyed and was jumping at every noise. Dad helped Roger out of the car, he was not in good shape. \n\n\"We've got to get him some help.\" \n\n\"We should get out of here.\" The only way was along a roadway seemingly leading up straight towards the pyramids. The sky looked calmer near the pyramids now, maybe the storm was passing over. \n\n\"There's stuff near the pyramids, like guards and stuff right?\"  \n\n\"I think so.\" And with that dad and Sarah got one of Rogers arms each and helped walk him towards the pyramids. And I had to follow. I mean, he's my dad, where was i gonna go? So with every inch of my body saying don't so this this, I followed behind. Suddenly another earthquake threw us all to the ground and the earth seemed to move a great deal more than any other I'd ever experienced before. I screamed loudly, grasping at the ground trying to hold onto anything. In the chaos and as the earthquake continued to roar and shake us I found myself on my back looking up at the sky, where the pyramids were there was a solid bean of light from each of them to the sky, my mouth open in shock I watched as a portal of light formed in the sky and something came out of it and floated down towards the pyramids. \n\n\"Daaaaaaaad??!!\"\n \n                                ***\n\nAs quickly as it began the storm abruptly disappeared. Everything went quiet as people reacted to this. I could hear sirens and some shrieking in the distance but no more rushing wind and earth-shattering rumbles and breaks. It was eery, sitting on that dusty ground, with the no longer scary but rather beautiful sky a deep purple colour around the pyramids where the portal remained. A glowing light around the pyramids made it difficult to see what came out but it felt wonderful. Like a warm glow in your heart, it felt like home. We all began walking towards it, and it just felt right. It was weird.."], [1, "Blood trailed down my cheek as I darted through the woods, ignoring the branches and barbed hooks of nature that tore at me. Alternating between heaving and huffing, I try not to think about throwing up as I curse my cardio for the umpteenth time that day. Far behind me, I hear their feet crunch against breaking ice and parting snow. I see their search lights shining past the back of my head.\n\nThey said that they would all be gone in six months if they don't \"get to know me\". Unfortunately for everyone else, I appreciate people in the same way a rabid wolverine would take to being toss down into someone's underwear against its will. Naturally, the only reaction I had was to run and hide in the Alaskan wilderness when faced with the horror of a twenty four hour, seven day of the week spew of interviews, meetings, and other bullshit that I just don't want to deal. Their response--which I should have anticipated--was somewhere between trying to kidnap me while pleading for me to stop.\n\nSome where along this journey of constant escaping, I noticed there were a lot of rich and famous people hunting me.\n\n\"You will nat gid away from meeehh!\" bellowed a very familiar voice harkening back to my childhood. I turn back briefly and instant feel terror surge through my veins and piss spill down through my pant legs as I tried to limp quicker.\n\n\"Come on, kid,\" cried a slurred voice, \"we just want to have a conversation with you. That's it.\"\n\nBeing pulled by several large snarling dogs was Arnold, Stallone, and Clint Eastwood with a long whip and a burning cigar. Running right past them was Usain Bolt, running through trees and melting snow behind him from sheer speed. The roar of an engine told me that Burt Reynolds had caught up again--I thought I lost him in Maine dammit--leaving my only option to head right, further into the maze of trees and mist of snow.\n\nMy tears felt like burning liquid fire as my vision blurred and my body ached. A man with an axe barely missed my leg as I heard Jack Nicholson yell gibberish at me. Far ahead of me, I could make out dots of dark and grey amidst the thin sheen of white that was the snow. More were coming my way. I needed to run up the hill now.\n\nSwallowing repeatedly, I forced by bile down and kept running. No sooner than two steps later, I noticed a large ball of snow tumbling down the hill.\n\nWithout warning the ball of snow burst apart, the unmistakable fat rolls of Steven Segal unsheathed itself from under the snow-covered jacket and reached out to bat me across the side of the head. The force of his weigh upon my face sent me sprawling over the small hill and into a tree. My ribs made a noise that was common heard in the kit-kat commercials when they snap the bars in half. Bile explodes out of my mouth and clench my numbing side, staggering on.\n\nForward: Sigourney Weaver and an army of feral dogs await. Backwards: Adam Sandler and the rest of his crew emerge from behind trees. I try stumbling to the side but I catch a whiff of Snoop Dogg's presence and retreat away. Limping out further, I heard them encroach upon me slowly; I have been cornered completely.\n\nIt was four meters from that hill that I meet the edge of a cliff leading into a running river far below. I collapse to my knees as they stop before me, Tommy Lee Jones standing ahead of them with warm blanket. \"Come on. You've run enough.\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk to you people,\" I sob, \"just send me e-emails with pictures of your faces attached. That counts too right. Right?\"\n\nTommy Lee Jones just looked unimpressed. \"I don't care.\"\n\nBreathing in and sniffling my snot back into my nose, I look down at the roaring river behind me and the army that was pushing through the forest, growing ever larger by the minute. They're already beginning to shout their names at me. There was no other way out.\n\nIf I was to die, I was to die on my own terms: antisocial to the end.\n\nFalling back back, I close my eyes and feel myself drop into the ice-cold embrace of the river, dragging me against the rocks and yanking both my arms out their sockets. Sometime between the screaming in agony and lacking oxygen, water found its way down my throat and somewhere, I hear a flute beckon me to a dull emptiness where I can sulk at nothing for all eternity in peace.\n\nFor a moment, I felt like I could finally rest.\n\nThen, light exploded into my eyes as a fountain of water burst forth from my lips. A immense pressure relieved itself from my chest as I drew in breaths of unwanted air, making know that I am back in this cruel and heartless reality that wishes me misery. I cough and try to rub my eyes but neither of my arms do anything but hurt more. Settling for blinking instead, I feel my vision clear slowly as I see a smirking grey haired man stare down at me with a helicopter sitting behind him.\n\n\"You're not the first one to try that trick you know.\"\n\nGod damn you Harrison Ford. \n\n\n\n\n"]], [[{"comment": "**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n", "id": "daqs693"}], [{"comment": "14 seconds.

Picking, and choosing who world be saved, yet the more I thought about it, the more afraid it made me. I new I wouldn't have the time to save even a fraction of the people I would want to, so I changed my mind, deciding to focus on quantity over quality. The rules were never clearly laid out, could I save people over the internet, or phone calls? That was how I ended up with my plan\n\nThe first thing I needed to do, was to find a way of communicating with the world's population. Since my Facebook was clogged by everyone, and their uncle, writing on my wall, or tagging me, I started a blog. The first thing I did was to layout my the rules. Anyone who wanted to meet me, would have to approach me, say their name, then give me a high five. After I returned the greeting, they would then have to leave, in order to make room for the next person.\n\nThe next order of business would be my travel schedule. I would be going on a long trip to every continent, and would make updates based on how far away I was to major cities. I knew I didn't have time to go everywhere, though I was hoping, giving enough notice, as many people as possible could have a chance.\nFinally, do to my current financial situation, I had to ask for donations. Plane tickets would have to be bought for me, so would food and drinks. I would need rides everywhere, as well as interpreters when I reached foreign countries.

This general refusal to interact with anybody else of the same species was generally comfortable, and nobody had any problems reciprocating, which was all I could have wished for.  My childhood consisted of nothing more than hours of perusing countless novels (of which only the lengthiest took me any sort of time to finish), and thus my bedroom in a rather typical suburban American household gradually filled up with material of my choosing.  \n\nUnsurprisingly, school was not a particularly enjoyable experience for me; to me, seven hours a day of keeping my head down and avoiding the more rambunctious students (if, given their apparent disdain for the implications of such a title, they can rightfully be called 'students') was nothing more than a waste of my time, which, I believe, could have been spent much more effectively through my own pursuits.\n\nOverall, I never was one to seek (or gain) attention, and that kept everyone perfectly happy, and save a few like-minded friends and my family (several members of which never ceased to annoy me), no one even knew that I existed.  This pattern continued through the entirety of my childhood, and I fully expected it to last through the rest of my life (which, due to this perfectly likable lifestyle, would ideally pass at a relaxed pace and come to a gentle end with me at a satisfyingly old age).\n\nNothing that I had been taught, both in school or through my own studies, could have in any way prepared me for this horrifically drastic turn of events, nor could even my imagination have produced anything even remotely close to this level of magnitude.  \n\nThe announcement came just over a week ago -- that the entire world had been infected with an unforeseeable and unstoppable form of bacteria.  This in itself was unbelievable to much of  the world's population, and thus they continued on with life as usual.  They were shocked, then, when all of the governments of the world set mandates that required every citizen of the world to visit their nearest hospital and undergo a simple blood test; which, most of the scientists of the world had concluded, would be the simplest way to determine whether or not anyone in the world had naturally occurring antibodies to this infection.  If anyone was shown to be resistant, this would speed up the development of an artificial cure exponentially.  \n\nJust a few minutes after staring slack-jawed in disbelief at the television, my parents, with whom I had experienced very little voluntary interaction in the past few years, grabbed myself and my two siblings and began the two-minute journey to our neighboring hospital.  \n\nWhen we arrived, the large building was already swarming with people desperate to be tested as well as the insufficiently small team of nurses attempting (rather unsuccessfully) to create an organized system to maximize efficiency.  After about ten minutes of everybody milling around looking for an unoccupied doctor or examination room, those attempting to make order managed to get everybody into lines -- which, at this point, ran on quite a ways past the doors -- to each room, where each person would be tested one at a time.  \n\nIt took perhaps thirty minutes for my family to reach the front of one of the lines, and after a few minutes more, I stepped into the examination.  The doctor had a slightly twisted look on her face, as if she had made up her mind to be calm but couldn't quite accomplish the feat, but she was quite fast about obtaining the sample.  I was (in a not particularly gentle fashion) forced onto the cushioned bed, at which point she jabbed a hastily sterilized needle into my forearm (the world, I suppose, isn't worried about infections of the 'curable' type).  As I was removed from the room, I caught a glimpse of my blood, about which it had never occurred to me that there might be something special, being carefully placed into a centrifuge.  As I was pushed out of the way by the next person (who was muttering some choice expletives at my dawdling) and back into the mass of people, an overwhelming sense of helplessness came over me.\n\nSimply being around so many other humans often made me anxious, but this was something peculiarly potent; I inexplicably began feeling as if I was responsible for everyone within the room and that there was nothing I could possible do to save all of them.  The feeling passed quickly, and I rejoined my family shortly after being jostled by the entire population of my city; yet for the rest of the day, I could not shake the feeling that something even larger was about to happen.\n\nThe next two days passed rather uneventfully; the world sat in silence, every family gathered around their television, hoping for any ounce of hope that accompanied a discovery.  At the very end of that second day, it seemed that the world was slowly giving up its belief in the possibility of a cure, and this was apparent just on the faces of all I saw.  The man giving consistent updates (none of which were promising) on the television became more and more tired as the day went on; his suit, which had been crisply pressed that morning, gradually attained countless lines, as did his face.\n\nThe announcement came at approximately one o'clock in the morning of the third day, leaving the world in awe.  Of everyone who had been tested (which was estimated to have been over 4/5 of the world's population), only one individual had been found to have a resistance to this strain.  That person was me.\n\nAt first, I refused to believe that it could possibly have been me, seeing as how there must be countless people with the same name, but it became obvious that I was about to be in over my head when the doctor who had tested me came to our front door.  After a couple of heavy knocks, my mother stood up and let her in.\n\nThe doctor now wore simply an expression of disbelief, and she proceeded to explain that out of seven billion people, I was the sole person with this trait and that I was essentially humanity's only hope for survival.  From there, she stated that given its current course, the disease would likely exterminate the population of the earth within six months -- all dead, except me.  \n\nAccording those leading the development of a cure, however, it may take significantly longer than those six months to get a working treatment.  In the meantime, the only way to become immune to the infection is through interaction with the sole immune individual.\n\nAt this point, I was simply unable to comprehend the importance of this, and I had it difficult to even believe that this was anything more than just a massive joke being played on the world.  I can assure you; it is not.\n\nJust a few hours later, the knowledge that I was the potential savior of the human race and that one could become safe simply by interacting with me became public.  Within minutes, there was a steady stream of neighbors showing up at the door, and after a few more, people from the city itself were coming in hordes.  \n\nThis was too much for me to handle, and in a sudden fit of panic, I dashed upstairs to my place of refuge.  Only with my books surrounding me did I feel any sort of peace, and my whirling mind slowly came to reason and began thinking logically about the situation.\n\nI had six months to attempt to save as many people as possible -- 180 days.  Of course, there is no way to meet every single citizen of the planet within that span of time, or even in the span of my lifetime.  How then, must a teenager who has had, for the majority of his life, very limited experience with other people decide which people may live and which may die?  How can someone previously unknown to all but a select few within a few minutes' time become the most well-known person on the planet?\n\nEven now, my mind is still trying to make sense of it all.  I suppose I will have to form some rather severe criteria, but already I fear that I will let my unconscious biases somehow decimate the human race -- that I, having been given the chance to save as many people as I can, might somehow screw it up for all of us.\n\nI've never been religious, but right now, some spiritual guidance would certainly be gratefully received. . . \n\n\nCan't finish this right now (almost 2 AM), but I will if I feel up to it tomorrow.  See how well this goes for my first attempt.  \n\n ", "id": "darkcoc"}, {"comment": "Oh, please do continue!", "id": "darm4te"}], [{"comment": "A week ago I would usually get messages from the same two people, my mother, her new boyfriend to pick up some food from the corner store.

I was in Egypt with my dad and his new girlfriend Sarah, we were seeing the sights by getting a burger with a beautiful view of the pyramids. Mom got custody when they split so I didn't see much of my dad, which was a shame but probably worked out great for him, he was never around much anyway. Roger had sat down at the table next to ours, flicking some table shit onto the floor. Roger started eating, and I didn't see him; I heard him. It was gross, might actually make you gag and throw up gross. I didn't want to look at him in case the action matched the visceral noise pollution that was infecting my very being. So forgive me but I really didn't like Roger. \n\n\"Dad can I go outside?\"\n\n\"What why? I'm not done eating.\" \n \nObviously he hadn't noticed and/or wasn't affected by the disgusting display next to us. \n\n\"I just..\" A loud CRAAACK interrupted me and the restaurant shook. I grew up where earthquakes were common enough, so my table went into quake mode. \n\n\"Earthquake, hold on!!\" Dad wasnt worried, he always kept a serious but relaxed attitude to quakes. \"Not a biggie.\" He smiled as the quake died away and I noticed Roger flailing around on the floor yelping like a small  but fat dog that was stranded on a small beach. Dad went to help him up after checking on Sarah, who had kept her cool actually. As dad got Roger back into a chair I looked out the window at the pyramids.. \"uhhh, dad?!\" \n\n                               ***\n\nThe sky had turned a deep red, cracking with lightning and the clouds were swirling around the pyramids faster than I had ever seen clouds move before, it felt unnatural. A shiver went down my spine and I looked at dad, and he was not the calm and collected guy I had known my whole life. Sheer terror was plastered all over his face, and it frightened me to the core. I was frozen in place with fear. \n\n\"We're going. NOW!\" My dad sounded so scared in that moment we said nothing and just followed him. We got outside and felt lost. We had planned to see the pyramids and had no plans to get back to the hotel. Was it ok to go back to the hotel? A loud thunderous noise erupted like a sound volcano so loud it made me jump. We turned to look at the pyramids, where everything seemed to be going on. \n\n\"It's the pyramids!\" My dad was shouting as the wind whipped up around us, I grabbed onto his arm just in case the storm got out of hand, at this point I was basically reduced to my base emotions, there was no longer a thinking human being, just survival instincts and the very high potential of wetting my pants. He was right though. We looked out at the pyramids and it was like the heavens had opened up, except heaven was on fire or something. \n\n\"I've got a car, let's go!\" Roger was with us and he did in fact have a car. He opened the door to a luxury executive looking four door car, I looked at my dad like, are we going with this guy? And he looked at me the same way, and together we like psychically agreed we should probably totally definitely get in the car and get the fudge out of dodge. We got into the car, Roger driving, dad in front and me and Sarah in the back. As we pulled out of the parking lot I could see people freaking out all around us. It was completely surreal. \n\n\"Seatbelts!\" Dad said, which was funny cause it was mom who always fussed about seatbelts growing up. Mine was already on, the habit ingrained deeply in my being. \n\n\"I'm Roger.\" \n\n\"Hi Dennis. This is my daughter and this is Sarah.\" My dad made the introductions quickly. \n\n\"We can't get through here.\" \n\n\"Try down that way, it looks clearer.\" As my dad navigated with Roger I felt helpless. I kept an eye on the sky around the pyramids, we seemed to be getting a bit closer to it actually. \n\n\"Daaad?\" People were screaming and running everywhere, it was total chaos on the streets. Suddenly a car swerved in front of us hit another, I heard the crash more than I saw it, but Roger swerved and went off the road. I was flung from side to side, and Sarah fell against me hard, she wasn't wearing her seatbelt, when we straightened out and slowed down she changed that quickly but my head was still throbbing from the hit. \n\n\"Everyone ok?\" Dad turned around to look at us, I smiled meekly and tried to say something but couldn't. The world was still going crazy outside the car and suddenly it was being hit by someone. A couple of people were trying to open the doors to the car. \n\n\"Fuck!\" Roger Yelled as someone opened his door and started clawing at him. \n\n\"They're trying to get in, DRIVE!!\" Roger put his foot down and we sped forwards hitting something which cracked the windscreen. The car broke through a fence and then another as we sped up and turned a corner. Roger kept his foot down and we got back on a very packed road. I could hear things as we hit them, some small sounds like a wing mirror or something and others were much worse hits. \n\n\"Stop!\" My dad was shouting and I couldn't make it all out. I just wanted to get out of there and I felt like I was going to die. And then I almost did as Roger ploughed into the side of a truck. \n\n                                ***\n\nWhy the hell did we get into the car with that gross guy again? Oh yeah the world was ending. I didn't pass out but I felt like I did. The car was full of dust, and there was now a high-pitched sound accompanying the end of times sound outside the car. \n\n\"Dad?\" I rubbed my eyes even though they weren't blurry. I looked at Sarah who was shaking next to me. \"Are you OK.\" \n\nShe smiled a little back. \"Sure. Fine.\" She didn't sound it. \n\n\"Dad?\" He didn't respond. \n\n\"Dennis?\" Sarah took her belt off and moved forward between the seats blocking me. \n\n\"Dad are you OK? Is he ok?'\" I pulled at my belt and tried to undo it. In my panic it took me a minute. I opened the car door and jumped out. I fell down immediately, like the crash had knocked my gravity controls out. I stayed down for a beat, as my head swayed. I got up and went to dad's car door and opened it. \n\n\"Dad?\" \n\n\"I'm OK.\" I hugged him, relief washing over me. \"We've got to go.\" I let go and he got out. There was a cut spilling blood from his head. \n\n\"Your head?!\" \n\n\"It's ok. I'm fine, we can't go that way.\"  Black smoke filled the sky ahead from a fire somewhere. \n\n\"This way.\" \n\n\"What about Roger?\" Why did I say that? My dad turned and went to check him. Sarah looked completely destroyed and was jumping at every noise. Dad helped Roger out of the car, he was not in good shape. \n\n\"We've got to get him some help.\" \n\n\"We should get out of here.\" The only way was along a roadway seemingly leading up straight towards the pyramids. The sky looked calmer near the pyramids now, maybe the storm was passing over. \n\n\"There's stuff near the pyramids, like guards and stuff right?\"  \n\n\"I think so.\" And with that dad and Sarah got one of Rogers arms each and helped walk him towards the pyramids. And I had to follow. I mean, he's my dad, where was i gonna go? So with every inch of my body saying don't so this this, I followed behind. Suddenly another earthquake threw us all to the ground and the earth seemed to move a great deal more than any other I'd ever experienced before. I screamed loudly, grasping at the ground trying to hold onto anything. In the chaos and as the earthquake continued to roar and shake us I found myself on my back looking up at the sky, where the pyramids were there was a solid bean of light from each of them to the sky, my mouth open in shock I watched as a portal of light formed in the sky and something came out of it and floated down towards the pyramids. \n\n\"Daaaaaaaad??!!\"\n \n                                ***\n\nAs quickly as it began the storm abruptly disappeared. Everything went quiet as people reacted to this. I could hear sirens and some shrieking in the distance but no more rushing wind and earth-shattering rumbles and breaks. It was eery, sitting on that dusty ground, with the no longer scary but rather beautiful sky a deep purple colour around the pyramids where the portal remained. A glowing light around the pyramids made it difficult to see what came out but it felt wonderful. Like a warm glow in your heart, it felt like home.

A crowd was forming and we joined it. We all slowly got closer and soon we were almost underneath the glowing orb.

We all bathed in the glowing light, it felt like more than light, like it was touching me lightly all over.\n\nI dont know now if I heard a voice, or how long I'd been standing there, but I knew that I had to kill everyone else around me. If I did, I won my life, and the ability to grant life. I didnt fully understand it, but I knew it. I looked around at everyone, I couldn't see my dad. Shit! People began to move, and then it just exploded. Everyone began attacking each other. Pulling and hitting and strangling. Everyone trying to kill each other. I couldn't kill. I saw an old lady being brutally beaten to death by the people around her and I saw their faces. It was horrifying. They were grotesque, their features gnarled up like snarling dogs. I turned frantically around looking for dad. \n\n\"DAD!\" Was that him? Yes, and there was a man attacking him, but he punched him hard and the man fell down. He turned and hit another who jumped at him. I fell back over a body. How the hell was this happening?! Suddenly my dad was on top of me, and for a moment it looked like he would kill me. But instead he pulled me up and dragged me away. We got to the base of a pyramid and he motioned up. \n\n\"Start climbing. Safest place.\" I didn't need telling twice, it was away from the crazies. We began climbing up the stepped side of a pyramid. Dad stopped a ways up and we turned to look. There was still people going at it and bodies littering the floor. I didn't know why it was happening and at the time I didn't question it, I just knew it was what was happening now whether I liked it or not. Some people started making their way up the pyramid. \n\n\"Keep going to the top.\" We carried on climbing up. \n\n\"Sarah?!\" I suddenly remembered. \"Wheres Sarah?\" Dad gave me a look that said he didn't want to answer that question, but she was not ok. I turned back to keep climbing. \n\nWe got to the top. I couldnt see properly what was going on below but people were still killing each other. I knew they were. As time passed and we sat together silently I could feel that we were almost the last ones left. I didn't know what was going to happen but I knew one of us had to die. Could I kill me dad? \n\n                              ***\n\nNo way! Not even if I wanted to probably. I was screwed and I knew it. Everyone was crazed anyway, I didn't know why he wasn't trying to kill me, a part of me thought he was going to throw me off the pyramid or something, and I had accepted it as out of my control. It was weird, like my mind was blank. All I knew is everyone had to kill each other until there was one left. I didnt even know if that was just the area near the pyramids or the whole world. \n\nThe glowing light was watching us, the portal humming away in the background. It was oddly peaceful, even with so much carnage around us. The city was burning, crumbling and killing itself, but it just felt right. \n\nI heard a noise below us. Someone was coming. Dad stepped down towards them. He turned back. \n\n\"Stay here. Stay alive.\" I sat and waited for the end, or whatever was going to happen. I didn't watch him go. I kept my eyes on the orb thing, it was kind of mesmerising. I dont know how long it was before it happened. I just knew I had won. That means my dad died?! How did this happen? Maybe he got away or something. But I knew he didn't, he couldnt have. That was the rules of the game. One left alive. I looked at the orb with such hatred as it transferred the knowledge to me and everyone on earth. I had won my life, and now I could grant that gift to others, and in six months the orb would return and only those I met would be allowed to continue existing. Not a lot of responsibility or anything, but it didn't feel real. Even though it had to be, after everything I'd been through. The orb went back into the portal and disappeared, the portal closing up behind it. I watched the sky for a bit and then began my way down. I felt numb. Destroyed. I stopped halfway down the pyramid and collapsed on my side. I think I passed out and it was getting dark. I made my way down to the ground. I couldn't find my dads body, so I began walking. And I didn't stop. I felt like I couldn't die, but if I could, I didn't care. I wanted it to end. I just carried on walking. \n\nWhen the sun came up I was still walking. The desert felt like a nice place to be. I could be alone. I didn't feel hungry. I didn't feel thirsty. I didn't feel tired. So i just kept walking. When night came I didn't stop. I just kept going. It was dark but I just kept putting one foot in front of the other. I was in shock. But I was also angry and i didn't want to face anything. I just wanted out. \n\nBut I couldn't get away. Helicopters found me. People were coming for me. I dont know how they found me, it had to be that murder orb thing somehow. Everyone knows what's happened somehow. I tried to get away but I couldn't. I felt like I had the entire world on my back, and I guess looking back I kind of did. I was picked up by Egyptian army forces and was taken in a helicopter to a military base. Somehow I just knew they wouldn't shoot me, they needed me, but when I ran they grabbed me and restrained me pretty easy. They didn't treat me bad but they just wanted to save themselves. I didn't understand what they were saying but I knew they were arguing about what to do with me. They didn't have long. There was shouting outside and they left. After a while a man came in and introduced himself as an American from some high rank in the military and I was to go with him. So i did. They put me on a plane and I don't know where they took me. When we landed we transferred to another plane and waited. I didn't even know what country we were in, but I didn't care. I wasn't thinking straight.

The roar of an engine told me that Burt Reynolds had caught up again--I thought I lost him in Maine dammit--leaving my only option to head right, further into the maze of trees and mist of snow.\n\nMy tears felt like burning liquid fire as my vision blurred and my body ached. A man with an axe barely missed my leg as I heard Jack Nicholson yell gibberish at me. Far ahead of me, I could make out dots of dark and grey amidst the thin sheen of white that was the snow. More were coming my way. I needed to run up the hill now.\n\nSwallowing repeatedly, I forced by bile down and kept running. No sooner than two steps later, I noticed a large ball of snow tumbling down the hill.\n\nWithout warning the ball of snow burst apart, the unmistakable fat rolls of Steven Segal unsheathed itself from under the snow-covered jacket and reached out to bat me across the side of the head. The force of his weigh upon my face sent me sprawling over the small hill and into a tree. My ribs made a noise that was common heard in the kit-kat commercials when they snap the bars in half. Bile explodes out of my mouth and clench my numbing side, staggering on.\n\nForward: Sigourney Weaver and an army of feral dogs await. Backwards: Adam Sandler and the rest of his crew emerge from behind trees. I try stumbling to the side but I catch a whiff of Snoop Dogg's presence and retreat away. Limping out further, I heard them encroach upon me slowly; I have been cornered completely.\n\nIt was four meters from that hill that I meet the edge of a cliff leading into a running river far below. I collapse to my knees as they stop before me, Tommy Lee Jones standing ahead of them with warm blanket. \"Come on. You've run enough.\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk to you people,\" I sob, \"just send me e-emails with pictures of your faces attached. That counts too right. Right?\"\n\nTommy Lee Jones just looked unimpressed. \"I don't care.\"\n\nBreathing in and sniffling my snot back into my nose, I look down at the roaring river behind me and the army that was pushing through the forest, growing ever larger by the minute. They're already beginning to shout their names at me. There was no other way out.\n\nIf I was to die, I was to die on my own terms: antisocial to the end.\n\nFalling back back, I close my eyes and feel myself drop into the ice-cold embrace of the river, dragging me against the rocks and yanking both my arms out their sockets. Sometime between the screaming in agony and lacking oxygen, water found its way down my throat and somewhere, I hear a flute beckon me to a dull emptiness where I can sulk at nothing for all eternity in peace.\n\nFor a moment, I felt like I could finally rest.\n\nThen, light exploded into my eyes as a fountain of water burst forth from my lips. A immense pressure relieved itself from my chest as I drew in breaths of unwanted air, making know that I am back in this cruel and heartless reality that wishes me misery. I cough and try to rub my eyes but neither of my arms do anything but hurt more. Settling for blinking instead, I feel my vision clear slowly as I see a smirking grey haired man stare down at me with a helicopter sitting behind him.\n\n\"You're not the first one to try that trick you know.\"\n\nGod damn you Harrison Ford. \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "darn2kc"}]]], "5gekvx": ["[WP] In an alternate world all mail-order items are exactly as advertised.", "2016-12-04 11:32:10", 1, "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5gekvx/wp_in_an_alternate_world_all_mailorder_items_are/", [[1, "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n"]], [[{"comment": "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n", "id": "darmq4b"}]]], "5gcz1o": ["[WP] The life of an immortal pet.", "2016-12-04 04:20:28", 4, "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5gcz1o/wp_the_life_of_an_immortal_pet/", [[1, "Frilligan's diary!\n\nEntry 1: Wow!

No matter what, once the master died she had to create distance. Whether that meant leaving the city or leaving the country, she always had to make sure that no-one who knew her in her past life would be able to recognize her. That rule was one she set for herself a long time ago, before they even thought to give her names. It'd worked pretty well for her so far. It created less messes, made things less complicated Some nights she even convinced herself it was easier for everyone involved.\n\nThe times in the wilderness were hardest, a kind of gulf that, however unpleasant, she knew would always need to be crossed at one point or another. This was her time to renew, to clean the slate, as the humans say. The first thing she knew needed to go were the smells. More than anything the smells were what kept her attached, specific ones like peach scented-perfumes, J.C Penny Christmas catalogs and brass table lamps were always hard to get rid of. Some nights, wrapped in the smog of an industrial scrap yard she managed to forget them entirely, even when she tried to recall them in fits of nostalgia. Those were the nights she cried the most.\n\nShe made special care to avoid talking to other animals, especially other cats. Too much risk of getting attached. Besides, they rarely made for good conversation anyways. The long years had detached her in a way from her \"animal instincts\" as the humans called it, but however aloof she maintained herself, always there festered a fear in the back of her mind that some swaggering Tom would end up sweeping her off her feet. She'd then spend hours imagining herself with a litter or two, watch them grow, then once they left and her beau died she'd move on again. Centuries ago she'd given in to these temptations. Those were always good times, the best even. She could play at having a normal life outside of the not getting old part. She wondered how many children she had. After the first dozen litters she lost count. Maybe they were like she was. It was usually around that point that the fantasy became hard to swallow.\n\nSometimes the cleansing process of took weeks, occasionally months, rarely years. If she were lucky her master would die in the spring, then at least the nights would be warm, if not dry. This time around she wasn't so lucky, but in the long run it didn't matter much. All it meant was she'd be a little hungrier than usual. In these times barns were her primary home, the creaky moans of rusted hinges made for familiar ambience no matter where in the world she was. The ones with lofts were the best, since they had a view. She'd rest her front paws over top of one another, lower her head on top of them and let her tail swish and flop about her make-shift hay bed.

She imagined each one crashing a mile down the road. Such a pity. She had two masters die that way.\n\nIt was hard to see down the road. The late morning temperatures had evaporated much of the snow from the weekend before, leaving layers of thick fog that cut visibility to mere feet. She padded the ground, feeling for vibrations, but the rigid dirt said nothing.\n\nSome time had passed since the last car, so in her uncharacteristic impatience she figured it was safe. Every road-crossing was a risk, less about getting hit and more about what might happen after. Besides, the feeling of familiarity was creeping in, which meant she was probably around somewhere she'd been before. Years of roaming had caused that, and it may have been decades, centuries even since she'd been there, but a risk was still a risk. \n\nShe got halfway across when out of nowhere a roaring beast rounded the corner.

The thick smell of salted snacks and soda stained upholstery made her scrunch her nose in disgust. Two humans sat in the front seats: a man and a woman. They were screaming, but she couldn't make their words out over the roar of the engine. Every few seconds an unlit streetlamp whooshed by, becoming less and less frequent until soon they came to a complete stop.\n\n\"Karly, calm down.\" the man said.\n\n\"No!\" the woman shouted back \"We almost hit a cat, Cam, I can't fucking calm down!\"\n\n\"The fucking cat is o.k, all right. Just stop freaking out, 'cause have you ever spun out on ice before? A little anxiety inducing.\"\n\nThe woman sighed \"Why did we have to go to your aunts. You don't even like her.\"\n\nThe man didn't respond, and soon the car began the move again. The roar of the engine wasn't as loud anymore, they must have entered some kind of neighborhood.\n\nA few miles down the road, the woman turned in her seat to look at her. She looked pleasant enough, freckles, red hair. Reminded her of her time in Ireland. The woman tilted her head, eyes squinting.\n\n\"Hey, Cam?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\nThe woman paused, like she was considering her words carefully.\n\n\"This is gonna seem, like, really fucking crazy but...doesn't she look like Uncle Pat's cat?

The memory of the smells was coming back. She needed to get away, but the car had become a prison. The woman had turned back forward, but threw the occasional glance backwards which made her hairs stand on end. \n\nIt was on the fifth glance that she noticed the shape of her nose, and the final clue fell into place. Father Patrick Mulcahey, nearly two and a half decades ago. He was nice, a shame about that robbery. His nose looked exactly like the woman's. Her smile, too, had that same warmth as the good father, even if it was a little wide. \n\nNo. No, she couldn't allow herself to get attached. If they ever put the pieces together it would risk exposure. She saw the lengths humans went to prolong their meager lives. If they found out they might throw her into a lab, studying her, dissecting her until at last they found that oh so elusive secret, all the while locking her away night after night, with only the smell of burnt chemicals and anti-septic to keep her company.\n\nThe car slowed to a halt again, but this time the man pulled the keys, out of the ignition, silencing the engine, and stepped out. The woman leaned over between the seats and cupped her hands underneath her forearms and hoisted her out, cradling her in her arms. She felt her heartbeat - a little fast, she was probably excited. Against her fleece coat, she felt her eyelids droop, but as soon as the cold outside air brushed against her nose she snapped alert. Now was her chance. With a kick of her legs she leapt from her arms, half instinctually, and bounded for the nearest treeline she saw. She could almost feel the heartbreak emanating from the woman, from Karly. \n\nShe ran as fast as her legs could carry her. Puffs of powder erupted in her wake, and she heard nothing, nothing save for the soft crunch snow beneath her. Her mind raced, this wasn't supposed to happen. She tried to force the memories away, but try as she might she couldn't close the floodgates. Masters she hadn't thought of in centuries, like opportunistic intruders, encroached on the edges of her thoughts.\n\nAlmost half a mile into the woods, she came into a clearing, and finding her legs unable to run any further, she stopped.\n\nThere was nothing out here. No animals, no birds, no nothing. Spare leaves hissed above her. One broke off and landed nearby, disturbing the pristine field of snow surrounding her with the slightest indentation. Her legs ached. She knew no matter how much she tried she'd never be able to outrun this. It had already infected her too much.\n\nShe turned, and with a brisk gait she trotted back along the path she'd carved, bouncing from one pawprint to the next. Woods gave way to suburban housing, and a familiar scent of newly shaved wood and fresh-brewed wassle wafted from the window cracks. It felt right, and in an instant all sense of protocol seemed to melt away like snow in a mid-winter heat-wave. \"I am a cat after all\" she thought \"why should she care about rules.\"\n\n"]], [[{"comment": "Frilligan's diary!\n\nEntry 1: Wow!

Let me warn you, before you go to Hogwarts...\"\n\nAnd he told Joey. About the killing curse - and its opposite.\n\n\"Of course, a mere child such as yourself couldn't actually call forth *that* spell's power...\" Ollivander said, at the end of the tale. \"Few can - only the most imaginative. But not one may be trusted with the terrible power to call forth anything they wished. To create anything. Terrible, yes. Terrible...\"\n\nHe didn't *look* like he thought it was terrible. There was no mistaking the greedy longing that shone in Ollivander's eyes. Joey left the shop elated - he could create *anything*. Anything at all. All he needed was imagination. And he had plenty of that, didn't he? He'd always had plenty of that...\n\n-------\n\nThe students stood on the dining tables in the Great Hall to catch a glimpse of whatever the kid had summoned. He'd said a few words none of them had heard before. And by the horrified expressions on the teachers' faces, it couldn't be anything good.\n\n\"What is that..thing, Joey?\" Headmistress McGonagall asked, looking down her nose at the creature hiding behind the boy.\n\n\"It's an Alakazam,\" Joey started to explain, but the other children just stared at him blankly. Only one other muggle-born boy grinned in recognition. \"I always wanted one, but no-one would trade a Kadabra with me. You know, Abra, Kadabra...\"\n\n\"Stop saying the forbidden spell!\" McGonagall snapped. \"You've done enough. I admit, I stand amazed that you could manage this spell. You have talent, and potential. But you cannot use it to call forth - \"\n\nShe groped for words to describe the furry yellow thing with the ridiculous moustache, brandishing a spoon in her direction. \n\n\"*That*,\" she finished. \"Stand back, all of you.\"\n\nShe pulled forth her own wand and pointed it at the thing. \"Stupefy!\"\n\nThe curse hit it squarely in the chest, and it keeled over with a strange, high-pitched sound.\n\n\"Nooo! My pok\u00e9mon! You killed it!\" Joey wailed, clutching the crumpled, yellow body of the creature to his chest, to  mingled screams and laughter from the crowd. \n\n\"Come, boy, don't carry on so, it's merely stunned,\" McGonagall said, though she resolved to use the killing curse when she had the thing alone. She pulled Joey away from the creature, gesturing to another teacher to remove it from the Hall. \"You need to come to my office. I need to talk to you. You have power, obviously, but no idea how to use it...come on, now...\"\n\nJoey allowed himself to be dragged away as McGonagall prattled on, thinking furiously. He could do *anything*. Conjure the legendary pok\u00e9mon. Create a potion to heal his Alakazam. They wouldn't laugh at him, after that. They'd fear him. Like they feared Voldemort, all those years ago. \n\nMaybe he needed a cool moniker, too.\n\n\"Now, Joey -\" McGonagall was saying, but he interrupted, drawing himself up and looking her in the eye. She'd regret hurting his Alakazam, soon enough. She'd regret challenging him.\n\n\"Call me Ash,\" he said, feeling faintly disappointed that she didn't immediately gasp in awe but instead just stared at him like he'd been hit in the head with a bludger. No matter. She'd know, soon enough, what that meant. \n\nThey would *all* know. \n\n----------\nHope you enjoyed my story!

Her very first day at Hogwarts, her very first class, and with a single word and a single flick of her wrist she might very well have gotten herself expelled. She pressed her back against a pillar and listened to Professor Flitwick remonstrate with the Headmistress. \"As a Muggle-born, I would have though there would be some sort of introductory class, some sort of orientation about the - the powers and responsibilities of magic, so that we don't have first years running around uttering Unforgivable Curses on their first day of class!\" \n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she heard McGonagall say wearily, \"and where is this student now?\" Jennifer shut her eyes, blinking back tears, preparing for her swift expulsion. Would they wipe her mind? she wondered. Would she wake up again in her bed the next morning as if the last month, the letters, the visit from a genuine wizard, had never happened? Or worse, would they let her remember what she had lost? Just the sheer, unbridled joy of discovering an entire magical world open to her - \n\n\"Miss Hovland,\" Flitwick spoke up. She started and turned to face him guiltily. Her precious wand (alder, eleven and three-quarters inches, core of unicorn hair) was hanging loosely from Professor Flitwick's belt, from when he had magicked it out of her hands. \"I wish to tell you that I am very sorry about how I handled that entire situation, it was quite unprofessional of me,\" he said, fiddling with his glasses, wiping them on his robe. \"None of this was your fault, of course, you simply had no way of knowing. I was - I was simply panicked, you see, when you...\" \n\n\"I'm sorry!\" Jennifer said, and to her horror started crying. \"I was just playing, it was just stupid, I'll never say it again! It's just - it was a nonsense word to us humans, is all! When we - there are magicians, not real magicians, but people in top hats who play at magic, and they-\" She pressed her fists against her cheeks in frustration. \"I mean, it's not real magic, Muggles say it all the time and nothing happens-\" She quavered and burst into noisy sobs. \n\n\"Miss Hovland,\" said Headmistress McGonagall, towering behind Flitwick, her face stern. \"Miss Hovland, there's no need to start crying, no one is mad at you. It's -\" She glanced down at Flitwick. \"It's our fault, really, Hogwarts did not prepare you properly for the realities of magic.\" She laid a gentle hand on Jennifer's shoulder. \"We forget, sometimes, that the Muggle world continues to exist without our say-so.\" \n\n\"You're-\" Jennifer sniffed. \"I don't know what I did wrong, nothing happened. I swear, Miss McGonagall, I said the word but nothing happened-\" \n\n\"AbraCadabra,\" McGonagall said, crisply and cleanly and enunciating each syllable. \n\n\"Yeah,\" Jennifer said, nodding. \"It's just - it's just a nonsense word to us, when we want to play at being magic, it doesn't mean anything-\" \n\n\"Ah,\" said McGonagall, and gestured to a seat. Jennifer hesitantly sank down into its soft cushions. \"And therein lies the problem. For you see, it means quite a lot.\" McGonagall shook her head sadly. \"We fancy ourselves completely secret from the Muggle world, but there are, nonetheless, secrets, leaks, points of contact. The spell AbraCadabra, for example -\" \n\nFlitwick coughed noisily. \"Ma'am? I don't know if, um, if this is appropriate. She's only a first-year.\"\n\nMcGonagall turned to him. \"And yet she uttered an Unforgivable Curse.\" Jennifer felt a chill run down her spine again, and huddled in tight. \"What else would you have me do?\" \n\nFlitwick shook his head. \"The things we've come to,\" he muttered.\n\n\"AbraCadabra,\" McGonagall continued, \"like many Muggle rituals, is a corruption of an actual magical spell. An unforgivable curse.\" Her eyes went cold. \"A Killing Curse.\" Jennifer curled her legs up to her chest and hugged them. \"Once, who knows how many generations ago, a Muggle must have witnessed a wizard using the curse, and carried the words with them. And it's been passed on, generation after generation, morphing subtly with time, producing multiple variants, as a set of syllables that can unlock the magic of the world.\" McGonagall strode the room, eyes raised in thought. Her face was sallow, and cold as the stone. \"To Basilides, it was *Abraxas*, the Great Archon more powerful than both God and the Devil. In Hebrew, it was *Av, Ben, Ruach Ha Codesch*, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. To Crowley - quite the dilettante, he - it was *abrahadabra*, 418, the Essence of IAO, Ra Hoor, and Heru-Ra-Ha.\" \n\n\"And-\" Jennifer spoke up. Her voice was shaky, weak, almost inaudible. The great curved walls of the Headmistress' office seemed to echo the words, swallowing her whole. \"And - and so what does it mean? W-what does it do? Because I said the words, and nothing happened ...\" \n\nA small smile crossed McGonagall's face, breaking her stony demeanor. \"Why, it doesn't do anything. It's a set of nonsense syllables, a secret passed down and garbled until there's nothing meaningful left of it.\" \n\nJennifer blinked. There were goose bumps on her arms. \"But so why -?\" \n\nMcGonagall chuckled softly. Flitwick sighed and shook his head. \"Because a garbled message might accidentally be garbled back,\" McGonagall said. \"A mispronunciation, a lisp, a slip of the tongue, a stutter...\" She looked off into the distance. \"A simple accident, and you'd once again have the Killing Curse.\" She sat across from Jennifer, folding her hands in her lap. \"This is the problem with our two worlds. Little secrets slip. Dangerous bits of information tossed around as child's playthings.\" She leaned in to Jennifer, fixing her with a steely gaze. \"We did not teach you well enough. We are teaching you now. This is magic, Miss Hovland. This is the bending of reality to our will. AbraCadabra is a toy, a child's game. It is God and it is the Devil. It is death, and it is creation. You are a witch now, Miss Hovland. There is no more distinction between any of the above.\" \n\nEleven year old Jennifer Hovland shuddered in her seat and wet her lips, and her eyes, unwillingly, glanced over to Professor Flitwick and the wand still at his belt. \"So ... I'm not expelled ...?\"\n\nMcGonagall followed her gaze, and held out her hand to Flitwick, who startled and glanced down and quickly handed over the wand. Jennifer closed her hands around it again, feeling it crooked and thrumming in her hands, a bolt of lightning carved in wood. McGonagall rose and smiled down at her. \"Welcome to Hogwarts, my dear.\" "], [133, "BANG\n\nI jolted back with a loud yelp, tripping on my luggage and hitting my head on the cobblestone wall.\n\n\"Owww...\" I winced, rubbing my scalp, \"what did I do?\" I looked around. Everything had seemed to stopped moving, suspended in time.\n\n\"N-no way,\" I murmured, regarding the frozen objects with awe, \"it was just a joke... I didn't know...\" I kicked a rock, but it refused to move. Frowning, I kicked it once more as hard as I could, but the rock simply refused to budge.\n\n\"I can undo this...\" I muttered, reaching for my wand, suspended in midair, \"I'll undo this and get going to Hogwarts.\" I grabbed my wand and tried to wave it; but like the rock, it didn't budge.\n\n\"AbraCadabra!\" I shouted, still holding the wand. Nothing changed. \"AbraCadabra! AbraCadabra! AbraCadabraaaaaaa!\" Still, nothing changed.\n\nI tried for countless times and finally gave up. I sat down, exasperated and started to sob.\n\"Abra... AbraCa...dabra...\"\n\nAfter hours of self pity, I eventually calmed down and thought things through. \n\nAt least, I thought, I still get to see the wizarding world.\n\nStanding up, I looked up and sighed. AbraCadabra turned out to be the ultimate forbidden spell. So forbidden, that no one expected you to know anything about it.\n\nStupid muggles, saying it as a joke.\n"], [83, "I opened up the spell book, itching and excited to try out my first ever magical spell. My little feet squirmed in my new blue Ravenclaw uniform socks. I'd never done a spell before. I read through the names.   Athena, my pet owl, hooted, channeling my excitement, or perhaps trepidation.\n\nHow should I approach this? I looked through what i presumed was the table of contents... then I saw the heading, \"Spells of the Illegal Nature.\" My crinkling red hair stood on end. \"Whoooa...\" I breathed. \n\nI looked over at Athena. \"Shoooullld I...?\" She hooted in an almost desperate protest.\n\nIt couldn't hurt to look...\" I cajoled. I read the first one. \"AbraCadabra?\" I giggled. Then covered my mouth. \"AbraCadbra?\" That's something fake magicians at my friend's birthday party would say, before they did a trick. Well, I *actually* could do magic... so why not give it a shot? \n\nIt didn't sound so bad. And I couldn't figure out why it it was illegal. It wasn't like it sounded so terrible. Just said something about clothing and authority. Really, if it was illegal, why would they make it sound so vague?\n\nI got up off the bed, and stood up straight, holding my wand out. \"AbraCadabra!\"\n\nNothing happened. I frowned, and tried again. \"Abra-\" But before I could get in another swish-and-flick movement, the door to the Ravenclaw sleeping quarters burst open. It was Headmistress Professor McGonagall. \n\n\"Stop right there, Ms. Alicia Cathland!\" She flicked her own wand and grabbed mine. \n\nAll of a sudden, the fireplace in the room roared to life, and spat out a small item. I didn't know what it was. She looked at it grimly. Then said. \"Pick it up.\"\n\nI was terrified. What had I done??\n\nIt opened. It was a howler. It howled horrible, nasty things, yelling by a man. I couldn't catch most of it, but I did get the gist:\nThis spell would make the Minister of Magic's underpants turn inside-out... while he or she was wearing them.\n\nOh, and their clothes became invisible. \n\nThe End.\n"], [47, "SEE the problem is, the literal translation of AVARDAkadavra is 'i destroy as i speak'.

It's going to take MONTHS to track all of the damn things down."], [35, "I stood in the shop, gazing at the tangled grey mess that was the back of Mr. Ollivanders head. \n\n\"Perhaps... Perhaps...\" I could hear him whispering.\n\nIt didn't surprise me. Nothing surprised me anymore. The owl at the window had been more than enough, but the hidden brick doorway had tipped me over the edge. This was all some dream. And I might as well have fun while I was here.\n\n\"Try... this\" Ollivander whispered slowly, as he turned back. He held out... a stick. I don't know what I'd expected. Maybe some glitter? A star on the end? I held back a laugh.\n\nI took the wand from his hands. Suddenly, all around me was filled with a deep purple light and soft music seemed to play. Ollivander pressed further.\n\n\"Try a spell!\" He seemed almost giddy.\n\n\"Erm...\" I hesitated. Was he being serious? \"Abracadabra?\" \n\nHis face dropped. All giddiness turned to fear. All he could do was croak out a startled \"No-!\" before suddenly, he was gone.\n\nThe room was silent. Nothing moved. It was now just me here. I stepped forward, feeling the space where Ollivander had stood. Was he invisible? No. He was just gone. Vanished. Maybe he had just been teleported somewhere, or just turned into an insect too small to see? I wished it was there, but there was something in that look, that fear in his eyes, that told me this was it. He was just gone. \n\nI heard a loud banging on the window, and a woman screaming. I turned round in shock. This couldn't be real. A woman holding a caged toad was screaming from the street outside, pointing at me through the window. I could hear men shouting, and quick footsteps on the cobbles coming my way. What had I done? I looked down at where Ollivander had stood. All that remained was a small pile of ash, and a puff of white smoke. The shop remained still, too quiet for what I know realised was a terrible deed. I bolted towards the back of the shop, hoping for some sort of escape.\n\nI found it in the form of a grimy window, opening up onto the back alleys of Diagon Alley. Dark cobbles speckled with wood chippings and broken feathers twisted this way and that as I ran. Just ran, as long as I could.\n\nIt was dark once I stopped, behind a crooked black shop which had a suspicious smell coming from the chimneys. I sat down on the floor, tears stinging my eyes. The weight of what I had done was finally hitting me. It was always so *fun* when they used to do that one TV. A top hat and a black and white wand. It was so different when it was real. When it mattered. When it wasn't just a show.\n\nI felt a stab in my pocket. I looked down. The stick was still there. This stupid stick. This stupid stick that could do so much damage. I could hear whistles in the distance, echoed shouting. Could I go back? No. They wouldn't believe this. I didn't believe this. There was only one thing I could do. Maybe he had gone somewhere. Maybe I could get him back. I could only try. In the only way I knew how.\n\nI pointed the stick to myself.\n\n\"Abracadabra.\""], [25, "I sat in the back room of the leaky cauldron having a minor panic attack. It was only one spell, performed in a muggle-free area, surely it couldn't have been that bad. *Abracadabra*. The word almost slipped out again as I thought it. The trouble had started across the street in Bonny and Hetts, Bonnets and Hats. Rabbits of every size and colour bounding out of all the hats on display, leaving the hat for a just second before the next rabbit made its way through. The customers from Lucky Lucine's Casino let out an outraged roar as all of their playing cards suddenly started swapping and changing in place. Skinny Olivander, who I had only bought my wand from hours before, came charging out behind a row of wands that had grown fat and had white tips, each spraying flowers and sparks as they bounced away from their frustrated maker.\n\nI nipped back into the leaky cauldron and heard the sad moping of the barman, all his beer had suddenly turned to vinegar. The door to the back room was left ajar and I slipped into it, only wishing to be alone. Surely they'd trace it back to me? Surely I'd be expelled from Hogwarts before my first day. I was hopeless. A soft voice spoke out from the dim room. \"*It's ok laddy*\", the feminine Irish accent called out, \"*I can make all the trouble go away*\". I looked up in shock, a slender young red headed girl sat up on a stack of boxes, one smooth long leg thrown up over the other. \"*You're a wizard*\" I asked uncertainly. She giggled and dropped down to my feet, \"*No, but I have power, you just gotta do what I say*\".\n\nWanting the whole scary situation to be over, I complied. I felt powerless to her, so knowledgable and secure in her convictions. I cut my palm like she had asked, drawing the strange star across the rough floorboards. I stood inside it, chanting the strange words she had given me. They were heavy on my tongue, the muscles in my mouth tired after speaking them. I looked up at her, wondering if I had said them right, but she was not her anymore. Her body twisted and turned. The feminine cheek bones now horned spikes in a blood red skin. The sensual legs now muscled machines, covered in poison tipped barbs. The demon smiled, rotten shards of flesh stick clinging to its jet-black teeth. \"*Thankyou*\" he whispered, its body turning to smoke, the smoke moving first towards, then into my chest.\n\nI felt her. Him? It. I felt it, attached to my soul like a parasite. A deep shame burned my mind, what I had I done. \"*Now to complete my promise*\" its voice whispered into my ears almost seductively. I felt my wand hand lift if it's own accord. My mouth mumbling words that I did not know. I watched as my wand spewed out a soft ghostly apparition, the history of that spell. It flew through the wall and I forced my body to go to the door to watch. Unseen to any other, it attached itself to the wand of the bar keeper. I stood, confused. The doors opened all at once, two large wizards standing in each doorway. The fireplace suddenly burning black. One of the wizards lifted his wand aloft and it pointed itself directly at the the bar keeper. I couldn't watch, I slipped back into back room and hid once again."], [23, "At the time, I thought it was a little weird the spell was black but I didn't think much of it. Just kind of looked weird.\n\nBut it kept burning and burning. Every book, every piece of furniture in my room and it made its way outside. It was so fast and so hot.\n\nI called the fire brigade but there was no response.\n\nReality kind of slowed for a second and flying fire trucks came from the sky.\n\nA horde of broomsticks followed and I heard from the crowds 'aquafigus regato'.\n\nSo much water came from the sky. And I t felt so serene I actually forgot I was being swept away by the current.\n\nBut a large man grabbed me by my collar from the water and I noticed he had a broomstick in his other hand. \n\n'You fuggin nawvice.

He tells me to say something, so I wave it and go with the first thing that pops into my head.\n\nAnd Everybody. Freaks. The. Fuck.

Never say these words ever again.\" There's like ten people waiting in line behind me, and they all flip out. An entire family just dove for cover.

The only guy who didn't freak out was the old dude with the wands.

Headmistress McGonagall rushed in with her robes fluttering behind her.\n\nShe bull rushed towards the new student, his wand still dangling half in his hand from sudden shock and confusion.

That spell turned possibility into impossibility and impossibility into fucking possibility. The laws of statistics and permutation are being ass fucked by your spell right now, Larry.

They just saw giants and flying horses out of nowhere.\n\nHe turned to Hermoine who has finally emerged from a pile of books and was now staring at the kid in disbelief. \n\n\"What?\" Ron asked sensing a glimmer of pride in her eyes.\n\nShe ignored his query, instead, shifting close to the boy and asking in an eerie voice, \"What was the spell again?\"\n\nThe boy kept staring at the floor for long but a voice eventually escaped his mouth, \"AbraCadBra.\"\n\nHaving lived in London, she knew from where exactly he picked the spell from. She herself had tried it when got hold of her wand for the first time. Curious.\n\nShe was about to return to her books when a seemingly impatient Ron caught her by the arm and commanded in his fake rough voice, 'Explain.'\n\nHermoine sighed throwing her hands over the books. \"It's a thousand-year-old spell. A forgotten one, but there are few old records of wizards trying it in vain. All who tried either died or was paralyzed.\"\n\n\"What,\" yelled dumbfound Ron whose eyes had the same shade of curiosity as he stared at the kid. \" What does the spell do?\"\n\n\"It was invented by a half-blood, Nicholas. The spell can undo the veil that separates the muggle world from ours. He visioned a world where both sides can co-exist. \"\n\n\"Another brilliant mind with crazy ideas?,\" asked Ron with his thoughts, for a moment, returning to the battle at Hogwarts.  \n\n\"More or less.

You're wand shall be sent to you momentarily as congratulations gift.\" \n\nMan, I thought it was just a joke, I had been surfing reddit and came across a post on incognito websites for worthwile exploration. The site that caught my attention read, Hogwarts for Morons. I had clicked on it and had been told to enter some quick info to determine eligibility. After I entered the info, my damn computer caught a virus and went black. \n\n\"What the hell?\" \n\nI was so mad at the redditor who had posted that malicious website and ended up having to get a cheap computer till I had enough money to buy a new one.\n\nA couple of minutes later another email popped up.

Every Mathemagician primary school maths book, every cartoon, every character with magic has that word hanging around them at some point. There was cool maths stuff associated with this word, and weird-ass religious meanings.\n\n\"Abracadabra.\"\n\nThe tip of the wand glowed green, but did not cast.\n\nOlivander stood up.

I will become the BEST wizard to EVER have attended Hogwarts!\" Sylvia replied, with a coy smile. She continued to climb over a small heap of boulders until she reached the top.\n\"I'll do whatever it takes!\" she announced.\nSydus and Emma rolled their eyes. \n\"You're only a muggle-born. You still don't really know how magic really works. Emma and I have been around magic since the moment we were born! I think we have a better chance of becoming a famous wizard than YOU do.\" Sydus retorted, arms crossed and face scrunched up like he had sniffed an ogre's dirty socks. \n\n  Sylvia felt her face get hot. It was true she was muggle born and didn't know about magic until just a few months ago, but that didn't matter, right? Besides, muggles did have magic, it was just... different.\n\"I've been around magic!\" She stammered.\n\"No you haven't! You're muggle born and muggles are too stupid to know about magic!\" Emma cried out.\n\"Ye-Yes they do! There's a spell that all muggles know and its super powerful! Muggles don't know about wizards but they have magicians and they can do loads of things!\"\n  Sylvia felt her heart race. Magicians did do magic, right? Her mother had taken her to a magic show and she had seen the magician cut people in half, pull bunnies out of hats, and make people disappear. If a muggle magician could do that, than she could certainly. Sydus was obviously over the entire conversation and began to pull Emma away, who was getting increasingly upset.\n\"C'mon Emma, she's got no clue. Lets go.\"\n Emma pulled away from her brother's grasp,\" Then show us this super powerful muggle spell!\"\n\"Gladly,\" Sylvia bluffed, trying her best to appear confident. She whipped out her larch wood wand and smoothed her robes. \n\"I'll cast it on that tree over there. You might want to move.\"\nShe remembered the silly phrase the magician had said to make a stage volunteer disappear, Abra Cadabra, and the large swelling motions he had made and tried to copy the best she could. \nShe held her arms out and to move them in large, rhythmic motions, hoping it would at last look impressive.\n\"Abra Cadabra!\" She shouted, focusing intently on the dry willow tree about 20 feet away from them.\n\nA blast of yellow light shot from the wand.\nThe tree did not disappear, however. Instead, it curled and twisted. The wood snapped and splintered and the ground groaned. The tree seemed to fold in on itself, crunching and breaking with each movement, until it disappeared into nothing. \n\n\"I-I told yo-u!\" She blurted out, ignoring how much her hands shook.\n\nSydus and Emma\u2019s faces were pale, the warm glow of satisfaction began to replace the fear and shock that she had experienced just seconds before.\n\nThat moment was short-lived.\n\nIn a series of events that had unfolded far quicker than Sylvia could process, she found herself face-to-face with a stern-looking Headmaster Mcgonagall. She paced the length of the room in silence for a while before finally addressing the shivering 11-year-old girl. \n\u201cDo you understand the severity of your actions today?\u201d\nSylvia\u2019s voice trembled,\u201d No, Headmaster. Was it because I scared Sydus and Emma?\u201d\n\nThe headmaster shook her head, \u201cNo, it is far more severe than that. Perhaps you didn\u2019t know, but the spell you cast today was one of a few Forbidden Spells.\u201d\n\nPanic filled her lungs,\u201d I swear, Headmaster, I swear I had no idea! Abra Cadabra is just something muggle magicians say when they preform their tricks and I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal and I swear I never meant to scare or hurt anyone! Sydus and Emma were saying I couldn\u2019t become a great wizard because I was muggle-born and I told them that muggles could do magic and they have magicians and I may have lied a bit, but I still didn\u2019t know that it was a forbidden spell!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know a forbidden spell can land you a one-way ticket to Azkaban?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t send me to Azkaban, Headmaster Mcgonagall! I promise I\u2019ll never do it again!\u201d Sylvia wasn\u2019t exactly sure what Azkaban was, but it certainly didn\u2019t sound pleasant. It sounded like a terrible detention hall where poor muggle-born girls that cast forbidden spell unknowingly were sent to. Where they were denied the necessities of life, like dessert, and had to subsist on only a dinner of toast and beans. It shook her to her very core. \n\nHeadmaster Mcgonagall sat down in her seat with a sigh. \u201cI suppose I can\u2019t punish you for not knowing, especially since you are muggle-born. I\u2019m quite surprised you managed to use the spell, talented, I\u2019ll give you that. For future reference, don\u2019t use a spell that you aren\u2019t familiar with. You could hurt somebody.\u201d\n\nSylvia\u2019s heart rose, it sounded like she wouldn\u2019t get in trouble after all!\n\n\u201cNow, you did destroy school property, so you still have to have some form of consequence.\u201d\n\nHeart sank.\n\n\u201cGo with Hagrid and retrieve the tree that you managed to send away.\u201d\n\n\u201cRetrieve it?? Where did it go??\u201d Sylvia responded, baffled.\n\n\u201cA terrible place.\u201d Headmaster Mcgonagall replied, eyes darkening.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cNow these, these creatures are arguably the most terrifying creature I\u2019ve met,\u201d Hagrid said, \u201cThey\u2019re proud things and think they\u2019re better than all the others of their species. Getting them to part with the tree will be a doozy.\u201d He pushed open the heavy wooden door, the scent of freshly ground coffee wafted out the door. Goblins, in some ways like the ones at gringotts, sat reading newspapers and sipping coffee from plain white mugs. In many ways though, they were much different from Gringotts goblins. They had thick beards, wore flannels and clothing that made them look somewhat like a lumberjack. One of the creatures turned to Sylvia, looked her over, and scoffed. \n\u201cI attended Hogwarts before it was cool.\u201d\n\n"], [2, "I was only joking when I had Muttered the most powerful spell in existence. My friend had asked if I knew any spells, I was a muggle born and he was curious about our culture. I had jokingly responded with \"Judt abracadabra .\" When suddenly everyone in the room fell silent. They all had expressions of terror on their faces when I muttered the words. The effect was almost instantaneous, my wand hovered slightly above my hand and started to change. The wood itself didn't change color, rather it looked like the wand had been wrapped in a layer of shadows. The tips were glowing pure white. Someone in the room yelled \"Run, he's using the forbidden curse! I turned around to see who was yelling, but then a blot of white light shot out of the wand, hit the person who was yelling, and went flying back into my wand brighter than before. Then I felt it, a sudden increase in power. The student screamed \"He stole my magic! He stole my magic, and turned me into a muggle!\" Suddenly the room erupted into pandemonium, everyone was screaming and running away. I looked down at my wand covered in darkness, and at my robes as they slowly transformed into a tuxedo. I knew I had to do something, I couldn't just stand here as everyone around me descended into anarchy. I pointed towards my own head and said \"alakazam.\" Suddenly a top hat appeared on my head.

Who knew where he might have learned it.  To me it was just fun to say and sounded magical.\n\nI was only 11 years old and it was a world of wonder.  My father was Jewish and knew some Hebrew and once told me a literal translation was 'it came to pass as it was spoken'.  Growing up I was imaginative and always wished for magic to be real.  2 weeks ago an elegant letter was written to me and my childhood wish came true.  September 1st at 11:00am was less than a day away and I already read every book from that wonderful place called Diagon Alley.  There were no warnings about that word, just a warning that I was not to use my new wand and magic.\n\nAs I sat on my chair playing at my computer I held my wand and used it to type on the keyboard, it worked great as a stylus as well.  The nice gentleman at the wand shop said it was an extension of my will.  Of Wands and Men was a book my father bought for me from one of the subsection of Diagon Alley, it was a muggle shop owned by an elderly old woman and even he could feel the power emanating from her.\n\nI found myself tracing over a talisman I found in my searching and wishing for the time to pass faster until morning.  I spoke softly that word from my childhood.  My father came rushing into my room and spoke in a rush. It was time to leave.  I somehow lost the last night of my life and as I stood my legs collapsed from beneath my.  I felt numb and that pins and needles feeling ran it's course while I pushed myself to my feet.  My wand was still held firmly in my hand.\n\nIt was only a few more moments before my guardian from Hogwarts walked into the room to lead me to what he called the portkey.  We were to meet one other family with a child like myself and then be whisked away to the train.  I pulled on my shoes and followed the man to say my goodbyes to my father.  I still played with my wand and found myself wishing my mother could be here as well and once again muttered that word as I flicked the wand into my hoodies pocket.\n\n\"Mom!  You are really here!\"  I cried out as she rushed to hold me.  It was then that those words came back to mind, the words my father taught me about the meaning of that word.  It came to pass as it was spoken and my wishes were coming true.  I stepped back from my mother's embrace, she should be in the hospital.  Last I visited she was too weak to even hold my hand.  My father was crying, it was something I only saw once before when my mother was diagnosed.\n\nWe finished our goodbyes and my guardian was staring at me with an urgency so we left with no more thought to how she could be here.  She sat in her favorite chair staring at her now trembling hands.  My father stood beside her with one hand on her shoulder and the tears continued to fall.  It was a happy day for everyone.  I learned later that my mother was back in the hospital.  Her diagnosis was rescinded, much to the amazement of her doctor, and only remained for minor testing before being released.\n\n\"I heard the word you spoke this morning.  I have to know, where did you learn to speak such an ancient word of the creators?\"  My guardian asked in a tone I was unfamiliar with.  \"No wizard has been able to figure out the method to make it work for over a millennia, and yet I fear you might have.\"\n\nThe words prompted me to grab my wand for comfort, I twirled it in the form of that balance pattern and from the recesses of my mind wished for a way to explain.  I spoke the word aloud and my guardian nodded in a reassuring manner and the explanation became clear.  Yet I was unable to tell him, a warning came out instead.  \"It is not my place or the time to share this mystery with you.  I am meant to only share this with the man from the future.\"  Even I did not yet know who this person would be.\n\nThe other family waved from across the street and jogged across to meet us.  My guardians eyes never left me as he pulled the pocket watch from his satchel.  \"Grab the chain and close your eyes,\" turning to face the other traveler he continued, \"and you do the same as well young lady.\"  I did not see her as her hand reached out and only felt the tug of the pull through the ether.  I stumbled as our feet were returned to the ground and collapsed into the other girl knocking her to the ground as well.\n\n\"Welcome to Platform 9 3/4, please find your way onto the train and the prefects will guide you on the rest of the journey.\""], [1, "\"Alright Mr. Fitzgerald, as you know we like to do a full screening of our potential employees.

Diagonal Alley. I didn't buy the whole \"you're a wizard\" shtick at first but after the flying broom and hidden city in the middle of London, I just had to face that this was reality now, and adjustment is as hard as ever.\n\nApparently, there are more disadvantages than I thought being born from \"muggle\" (non-wizard) parents and entering the wizarding world. For instance, there are some things that you just can't say. Every wizard knows about the forbidden spells by the time they're ten, from news, books or friends at school. I was less fortunate. Yesterday, my guide, Bilbus, and I hit one of the first stops, Ollivander's shop, where I picked my first wand. You hand an eleven-year old a wand and what's he going to do with it? I'll tell you: wave it around and say \"Abra Cadabra.\"\n\nAt first, I didn't notice anything until I looked around the room. All the other boys and girls were staring at my face, mouths wide open in shock. The nearest girl, practically paralyzed asked me, \"Don't you know what you've done?\" The weight of the moment was only just starting to set in and I in a panic couldn't respond. \"By saying *those words*, you've... you've...\" she began but stopped abruptly. There was no need to finish, as everyone in the room felt it simultaneously. We all had a wet spot in our sock.\n\nAt first, I wasn't too bothered. Some of the more sensitive students were groaning with discomfort but it slowly grew on me too. I ran to my temporary room and changed socks, but it was still there. Moments later, Bilbus rushes into the room asking what I've done. Before I can even answer, he sees the small pile of worn socks and the emotionless pain on my face and he knows.\n\nTomorrow I go on the train to Hogwarts. No one is talking to me and I doubt they will start. Half the kids still have the wet spots and those who don't know someone who does.

They did not come with me.\u201d\n\nOllivander sighed. \u201cConsider yourself lucky, dear boy. Had you revealed your magic capabilities just a few years earlier, you might have found yourself in a whole world of trouble.\u201d\n\nJacob had no idea what the old man was talking about, but he nodded in agreement. \u201cI\u2019d like to try a few wands, if that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, of course!\u201d exclaimed Ollivander. He quickly jumped up and started sifting through his enormous wall of wands. \u201cLet us see\u2026 maple, no\u2026 oak, possible\u2026 ah! Try this one.\u201d Ollivander turned and walked towards Jacob, holding a long thin purple box. He pulled off the cover, revealing a beautiful piece of woodwork. Intricately carved, the wand had a simple handle, but it\u2019s beauty came from it\u2019s rich red coloring.\n\nJacob delicately pulled the wand from the box, examining its alluring design. \u201cBeautiful, is it not?\u201d said Ollivander reverently. \u201cCedar, slightly pliable, phoenix feather core. Imported from Montana, all the way in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d replied Jacob. He grasped the wand in his hands, and raised it in the air. He could feel the wand\u2019s energy coursing through him, endowing him with its power. He felt the wand growing warmer, as if asking him to use it. \u201cMay I\u2026 try it?\u201d asked Jacob.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, my boy. Point it at that lantern over there and concentrate. If you happen to know a simple charm, try using it.\u201d Jacob turned towards the lamp, directing his wand at the object focusedly. He thought of something to say, but he did not know any real spells. A memory of watching ridiculous magic tricks on television appeared in his mind. What did the magicians say? Some type of magic word\u2026\n\nJacob felt the wand begin to come to life, focusing its energy towards the tip, as if waiting for him to utter a phrase. The word popped into Jacob\u2019s head. In just one moment, he uttered the fateful word he had no idea was so dangerous: \u201cAbracadabra!\u201d\n\nAt that moment, all hell broke loose. Ollivander\u2019s eyes widened to the point in which Jacob thought they would pop out. He stumbled backwards, tripping over a pile of wand boxes. \u201cDear God, boy, what have you done?\u201d he wailed, shielding his face.\nA bright green light started growing from the tip of his wand, shining brighter and brighter the longer Jacob held it. The color was a toxic green, how radioactive waste appears. Jacob tried to drop the wand, but his hand felt locked around the accursed object. Just as the light reached the point in which it was almost unbearable to look at, a burst of green energy shot from the wand, hitting the lantern squarely and bursting it into a million pieces. The explosion of the lamp sent a shockwave of pale light backwards, knocking Jacob off of his feet into the wand boxes.\n\nHis head hit the counter of the store hard, and he felt a welt beginning to form. As he slowly began to drift away into unconsciousness, a figure appeared in front of him: a woman wearing a pointed hat. She uttered a few words to Ollivander, who was just managing to stand, as Jacob fainted.\n\n\n\n\u201cRennervate!\u201d exclaimed a muffled voice. Jacob\u2019s eyes peeled open to reveal the blurry image of two women standing over him. One was wearing a nurse\u2019s outfit, similar to the ones he had seen from old World War II books. She was the one who cast the spell. Her friendly face smiled down at him.\n\nThe other woman was the one he had seen at Ollivander\u2019s. She was older, but had a stern disposition. Her clothes were a sharp black robe furnished with a black hat, one that looked like the stereotypical witch hat. Despite her severe look, she had faint smile lines behind her eyes, veiled under a heavy layer of evident physical stress.\n\n\u201cThank you, Madame Pomfrey,\u201d said the woman wearing black, authoritatively. \u201cI need to have a private word with Mr. Clifton, if you do not mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not, Headmistress,\u201d said the nurse, who quickly exited the room.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d said the woman. \u201cYou are lucky to be alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lucky not to have the ministry all over our business too, if you ask me!\u201d cried a different, squeakier voice. Jacob craned his head around, but saw no one. \u201cDown here!\u201d He glanced down and saw a mat of hair sitting on a small man\u2019s large head.\n\n\u201cUm, my head hurts, and there\u2019s a bit of ringing in my ears. Other than that, it\u2019s not bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d said the lady. \u201cAllow us to introduce ourselves. I am Professor McGonagall, the headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The man you did not notice is Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. As I was aware, you were supposed to arrive at the school in two weeks, and preferably not in a stretcher.\u201d\n\nJacob groaned. He probably made a great impression on these two great witches and wizards, pulling a stunt and burdening them with having to deal with his injuries. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cI was set to arrive here on the first of September.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung man, do you have any idea the severity of the spell you just cast?\u201d Flitwick declared. \u201cThat is no magic that any eleven year old should even know of, let alone have the capability to cast!\u201d\n\n\u201cFilius, allow me. Mr. Clifton, are you aware of what you said?\u201d probed McGonagall gently.\n\n\u201cIt was something stupid. Something that you hear on cartoons or from books. It\u2019s a classical word that all magicians use. It\u2019s called abraca\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cShush!\u201d squeaked Flitwick. \u201cDo not say it in here!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is alright, Filius,\u201d assured McGonagall. \u201cI am aware of this. The word itself is a term muggles have used quite frequently throughout history. It is a corruption of the Killing Curse, repeated by muggles in an attempt to mimic the magic performed by witches and wizards. It is harmless if uttered by muggles, but unpredictable and quite possibly very dangerous if stated by a witch or wizard.\u201d\n\nNone of this made any sense, but part of what she said alarmed him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you say Killing Curse?\u201d\n\n\u201cA dark spell, not fit for first-years to be taught about. Perhaps Professor Weasley will bring it up in your fourth year of Defense Against the Dark Arts. In the meantime, answer me this: what was your intent upon the object you cast the spell on?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, um, tried to make the lantern disappear, like the magicians do,\u201d Jacob pondered. \u201cBut why does it matter? I said the word.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagic is not just about words, boy,\u201d Flitwick explained. \u201cWords help facilitate the passage of magic from your mind through the wand, but they are ultimately not necessary. Non-verbal magic is in fact a very common practice among accomplished wizards. Powerful spells are bred from both intent and skill. You trying to make that lamp disappear and your ease at destroying it in Ollivander\u2019s office is a sign of great potential, but also increases your need to have great caution in exercising your abilities. A lust for power only increases your desires to experiment with dark magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDark magic runs rampant, even after the Dark Lord\u2019s fall. We must be ever watchful in case it decides to rear its ugly head again,\u201d McGonagall stated. \u201cHowever, you, young man, need to rest. We\u2019ll leave you at your bed to sleep.\u201d The two professors turned and began walking towards the door.\n\n\u201cOh, before I forget,\u201d said McGonagall as she shuffled through her robes. \u201cI believe this is yours.\u201d She pulled out the red wand from Ollivander\u2019s and tossed it to Jacob.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want it anymore after what happened,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t want another incident or explosion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you better get on good terms with it. You\u2019re going to need it for the next seven years and the rest of your life.\u201d McGonagall turned around and opened the enormous oaken doors with a deafening creak. \u201cAnd please,\" she added, \"try not to kill yourself when we leave the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, professors,\u201d Jacob called to the two teachers as they strolled out of the hospital wing.\n\nJacob\u2019s head was swimming. He examined the wand gingerly, trying not to make a sudden movement as to set it off. The wand was beautiful still, but now he knew. The wand\u2019s beauty concealed a hidden power, a well of infinite possibilities that he had no idea even existed a few weeks ago. Jacob was still terrified of the piece of wood that almost killed him, but now he felt a sense of giddiness. Perhaps the wand was incredibly dangerous, but just maybe he was too."]], [[{"comment": "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n", "id": "daomdmy"}], [{"comment": "\"Abra Cadabra -\" Joey started saying with a giggle, waving his wand in Mr Ollivander's shop.\n\nMr Ollivander swept up from the corner of the shop, his silvery eyes huge with fright.\n\n\"What are you doing, boy?\" he whispered. \"Speaking the name of that spell?\"\n\nJoey stashed away his wand hastily, feeling rather frightened as Mr Ollivander glared down at him.\n\n\"Sorry, I didn't know...\" he began, and Mr Ollivander's eyes lost some of their fierceness.\n\n\"No, of course not,\" he said slowly. \"A muggle-born such as yourself would not know. Let me warn you, before you go to Hogwarts...\"\n\nAnd he told Joey. About the killing curse - and its opposite.\n\n\"Of course, a mere child such as yourself couldn't actually call forth *that* spell's power...\" Ollivander said, at the end of the tale. \"Few can - only the most imaginative. But not one may be trusted with the terrible power to call forth anything they wished. To create anything. Terrible, yes. Terrible...\"\n\nHe didn't *look* like he thought it was terrible. There was no mistaking the greedy longing that shone in Ollivander's eyes. Joey left the shop elated - he could create *anything*. Anything at all. All he needed was imagination. And he had plenty of that, didn't he? He'd always had plenty of that...\n\n-------\n\nThe students stood on the dining tables in the Great Hall to catch a glimpse of whatever the kid had summoned. He'd said a few words none of them had heard before. And by the horrified expressions on the teachers' faces, it couldn't be anything good.\n\n\"What is that..thing, Joey?\" Headmistress McGonagall asked, looking down her nose at the creature hiding behind the boy.\n\n\"It's an Alakazam,\" Joey started to explain, but the other children just stared at him blankly. Only one other muggle-born boy grinned in recognition. \"I always wanted one, but no-one would trade a Kadabra with me. You know, Abra, Kadabra...\"\n\n\"Stop saying the forbidden spell!\" McGonagall snapped. \"You've done enough. I admit, I stand amazed that you could manage this spell. You have talent, and potential. But you cannot use it to call forth - \"\n\nShe groped for words to describe the furry yellow thing with the ridiculous moustache, brandishing a spoon in her direction. \n\n\"*That*,\" she finished. \"Stand back, all of you.\"\n\nShe pulled forth her own wand and pointed it at the thing. \"Stupefy!\"\n\nThe curse hit it squarely in the chest, and it keeled over with a strange, high-pitched sound.\n\n\"Nooo! My pok\u00e9mon! You killed it!\" Joey wailed, clutching the crumpled, yellow body of the creature to his chest, to  mingled screams and laughter from the crowd. \n\n\"Come, boy, don't carry on so, it's merely stunned,\" McGonagall said, though she resolved to use the killing curse when she had the thing alone. She pulled Joey away from the creature, gesturing to another teacher to remove it from the Hall. \"You need to come to my office. I need to talk to you. You have power, obviously, but no idea how to use it...come on, now...\"\n\nJoey allowed himself to be dragged away as McGonagall prattled on, thinking furiously. He could do *anything*. Conjure the legendary pok\u00e9mon. Create a potion to heal his Alakazam. They wouldn't laugh at him, after that. They'd fear him. Like they feared Voldemort, all those years ago. \n\nMaybe he needed a cool moniker, too.\n\n\"Now, Joey -\" McGonagall was saying, but he interrupted, drawing himself up and looking her in the eye. She'd regret hurting his Alakazam, soon enough. She'd regret challenging him.\n\n\"Call me Ash,\" he said, feeling faintly disappointed that she didn't immediately gasp in awe but instead just stared at him like he'd been hit in the head with a bludger. No matter. She'd know, soon enough, what that meant. \n\nThey would *all* know. \n\n----------\nHope you enjoyed my story!

Her very first day at Hogwarts, her very first class, and with a single word and a single flick of her wrist she might very well have gotten herself expelled. She pressed her back against a pillar and listened to Professor Flitwick remonstrate with the Headmistress. \"As a Muggle-born, I would have though there would be some sort of introductory class, some sort of orientation about the - the powers and responsibilities of magic, so that we don't have first years running around uttering Unforgivable Curses on their first day of class!\" \n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she heard McGonagall say wearily, \"and where is this student now?\" Jennifer shut her eyes, blinking back tears, preparing for her swift expulsion. Would they wipe her mind? she wondered. Would she wake up again in her bed the next morning as if the last month, the letters, the visit from a genuine wizard, had never happened? Or worse, would they let her remember what she had lost? Just the sheer, unbridled joy of discovering an entire magical world open to her - \n\n\"Miss Hovland,\" Flitwick spoke up. She started and turned to face him guiltily. Her precious wand (alder, eleven and three-quarters inches, core of unicorn hair) was hanging loosely from Professor Flitwick's belt, from when he had magicked it out of her hands. \"I wish to tell you that I am very sorry about how I handled that entire situation, it was quite unprofessional of me,\" he said, fiddling with his glasses, wiping them on his robe. \"None of this was your fault, of course, you simply had no way of knowing. I was - I was simply panicked, you see, when you...\" \n\n\"I'm sorry!\" Jennifer said, and to her horror started crying. \"I was just playing, it was just stupid, I'll never say it again! It's just - it was a nonsense word to us humans, is all! When we - there are magicians, not real magicians, but people in top hats who play at magic, and they-\" She pressed her fists against her cheeks in frustration. \"I mean, it's not real magic, Muggles say it all the time and nothing happens-\" She quavered and burst into noisy sobs. \n\n\"Miss Hovland,\" said Headmistress McGonagall, towering behind Flitwick, her face stern. \"Miss Hovland, there's no need to start crying, no one is mad at you. It's -\" She glanced down at Flitwick. \"It's our fault, really, Hogwarts did not prepare you properly for the realities of magic.\" She laid a gentle hand on Jennifer's shoulder. \"We forget, sometimes, that the Muggle world continues to exist without our say-so.\" \n\n\"You're-\" Jennifer sniffed. \"I don't know what I did wrong, nothing happened. I swear, Miss McGonagall, I said the word but nothing happened-\" \n\n\"AbraCadabra,\" McGonagall said, crisply and cleanly and enunciating each syllable. \n\n\"Yeah,\" Jennifer said, nodding. \"It's just - it's just a nonsense word to us, when we want to play at being magic, it doesn't mean anything-\" \n\n\"Ah,\" said McGonagall, and gestured to a seat. Jennifer hesitantly sank down into its soft cushions. \"And therein lies the problem. For you see, it means quite a lot.\" McGonagall shook her head sadly. \"We fancy ourselves completely secret from the Muggle world, but there are, nonetheless, secrets, leaks, points of contact. The spell AbraCadabra, for example -\" \n\nFlitwick coughed noisily. \"Ma'am? I don't know if, um, if this is appropriate. She's only a first-year.\"\n\nMcGonagall turned to him. \"And yet she uttered an Unforgivable Curse.\" Jennifer felt a chill run down her spine again, and huddled in tight. \"What else would you have me do?\" \n\nFlitwick shook his head. \"The things we've come to,\" he muttered.\n\n\"AbraCadabra,\" McGonagall continued, \"like many Muggle rituals, is a corruption of an actual magical spell. An unforgivable curse.\" Her eyes went cold. \"A Killing Curse.\" Jennifer curled her legs up to her chest and hugged them. \"Once, who knows how many generations ago, a Muggle must have witnessed a wizard using the curse, and carried the words with them. And it's been passed on, generation after generation, morphing subtly with time, producing multiple variants, as a set of syllables that can unlock the magic of the world.\" McGonagall strode the room, eyes raised in thought. Her face was sallow, and cold as the stone. \"To Basilides, it was *Abraxas*, the Great Archon more powerful than both God and the Devil. In Hebrew, it was *Av, Ben, Ruach Ha Codesch*, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. To Crowley - quite the dilettante, he - it was *abrahadabra*, 418, the Essence of IAO, Ra Hoor, and Heru-Ra-Ha.\" \n\n\"And-\" Jennifer spoke up. Her voice was shaky, weak, almost inaudible. The great curved walls of the Headmistress' office seemed to echo the words, swallowing her whole. \"And - and so what does it mean? W-what does it do? Because I said the words, and nothing happened ...\" \n\nA small smile crossed McGonagall's face, breaking her stony demeanor. \"Why, it doesn't do anything. It's a set of nonsense syllables, a secret passed down and garbled until there's nothing meaningful left of it.\" \n\nJennifer blinked. There were goose bumps on her arms. \"But so why -?\" \n\nMcGonagall chuckled softly. Flitwick sighed and shook his head. \"Because a garbled message might accidentally be garbled back,\" McGonagall said. \"A mispronunciation, a lisp, a slip of the tongue, a stutter...\" She looked off into the distance. \"A simple accident, and you'd once again have the Killing Curse.\" She sat across from Jennifer, folding her hands in her lap. \"This is the problem with our two worlds. Little secrets slip. Dangerous bits of information tossed around as child's playthings.\" She leaned in to Jennifer, fixing her with a steely gaze. \"We did not teach you well enough. We are teaching you now. This is magic, Miss Hovland. This is the bending of reality to our will. AbraCadabra is a toy, a child's game. It is God and it is the Devil. It is death, and it is creation. You are a witch now, Miss Hovland. There is no more distinction between any of the above.\" \n\nEleven year old Jennifer Hovland shuddered in her seat and wet her lips, and her eyes, unwillingly, glanced over to Professor Flitwick and the wand still at his belt. \"So ... I'm not expelled ...?\"\n\nMcGonagall followed her gaze, and held out her hand to Flitwick, who startled and glanced down and quickly handed over the wand. Jennifer closed her hands around it again, feeling it crooked and thrumming in her hands, a bolt of lightning carved in wood.

I bolted towards the back of the shop, hoping for some sort of escape.\n\nI found it in the form of a grimy window, opening up onto the back alleys of Diagon Alley.

When it mattered. When it wasn't just a show.\n\nI felt a stab in my pocket. I looked down. The stick was still there. This stupid stick. This stupid stick that could do so much damage.

The door to the back room was left ajar and I slipped into it, only wishing to be alone. Surely they'd trace it back to me? Surely I'd be expelled from Hogwarts before my first day. I was hopeless. A soft voice spoke out from the dim room. \"*It's ok laddy*\", the feminine Irish accent called out, \"*I can make all the trouble go away*\". I looked up in shock, a slender young red headed girl sat up on a stack of boxes, one smooth long leg thrown up over the other. \"*You're a wizard*\" I asked uncertainly. She giggled and dropped down to my feet, \"*No, but I have power, you just gotta do what I say*\".\n\nWanting the whole scary situation to be over, I complied. I felt powerless to her, so knowledgable and secure in her convictions. I cut my palm like she had asked, drawing the strange star across the rough floorboards. I stood inside it, chanting the strange words she had given me. They were heavy on my tongue, the muscles in my mouth tired after speaking them. I looked up at her, wondering if I had said them right, but she was not her anymore. Her body twisted and turned. The feminine cheek bones now horned spikes in a blood red skin. The sensual legs now muscled machines, covered in poison tipped barbs. The demon smiled, rotten shards of flesh stick clinging to its jet-black teeth. \"*Thankyou*\" he whispered, its body turning to smoke, the smoke moving first towards, then into my chest.\n\nI felt her. Him? It. I felt it, attached to my soul like a parasite. A deep shame burned my mind, what I had I done. \"*Now to complete my promise*\" its voice whispered into my ears almost seductively. I felt my wand hand lift if it's own accord. My mouth mumbling words that I did not know. I watched as my wand spewed out a soft ghostly apparition, the history of that spell. It flew through the wall and I forced my body to go to the door to watch. Unseen to any other, it attached itself to the wand of the bar keeper. I stood, confused. The doors opened all at once, two large wizards standing in each doorway. The fireplace suddenly burning black.

A forgotten one, but there are few old records of wizards trying it in vain. All who tried either died or was paralyzed.\"\n\n\"What,\" yelled dumbfound Ron whose eyes had the same shade of curiosity as he stared at the kid. \" What does the spell do?\"\n\n\"It was invented by a half-blood, Nicholas. The spell can undo the veil that separates the muggle world from ours. He visioned a world where both sides can co-exist. \"\n\n\"Another brilliant mind with crazy ideas?,\" asked Ron with his thoughts, for a moment, returning to the battle at Hogwarts.  \n\n\"More or less.

You still don't really know how magic really works. Emma and I have been around magic since the moment we were born! I think we have a better chance of becoming a famous wizard than YOU do.\" Sydus retorted, arms crossed and face scrunched up like he had sniffed an ogre's dirty socks. \n\n  Sylvia felt her face get hot. It was true she was muggle born and didn't know about magic until just a few months ago, but that didn't matter, right? Besides, muggles did have magic, it was just... different.\n\"I've been around magic!\" She stammered.\n\"No you haven't! You're muggle born and muggles are too stupid to know about magic!\" Emma cried out.\n\"Ye-Yes they do! There's a spell that all muggles know and its super powerful! Muggles don't know about wizards but they have magicians and they can do loads of things!\"\n  Sylvia felt her heart race. Magicians did do magic, right? Her mother had taken her to a magic show and she had seen the magician cut people in half, pull bunnies out of hats, and make people disappear. If a muggle magician could do that, than she could certainly. Sydus was obviously over the entire conversation and began to pull Emma away, who was getting increasingly upset.\n\"C'mon Emma, she's got no clue. Lets go.\"\n Emma pulled away from her brother's grasp,\" Then show us this super powerful muggle spell!\"\n\"Gladly,\" Sylvia bluffed, trying her best to appear confident. She whipped out her larch wood wand and smoothed her robes. \n\"I'll cast it on that tree over there. You might want to move.\"\nShe remembered the silly phrase the magician had said to make a stage volunteer disappear, Abra Cadabra, and the large swelling motions he had made and tried to copy the best she could. \nShe held her arms out and to move them in large, rhythmic motions, hoping it would at last look impressive.\n\"Abra Cadabra!\" She shouted, focusing intently on the dry willow tree about 20 feet away from them.\n\nA blast of yellow light shot from the wand.\nThe tree did not disappear, however. Instead, it curled and twisted. The wood snapped and splintered and the ground groaned. The tree seemed to fold in on itself, crunching and breaking with each movement, until it disappeared into nothing. \n\n\"I-I told yo-u!\" She blurted out, ignoring how much her hands shook.\n\nSydus and Emma\u2019s faces were pale, the warm glow of satisfaction began to replace the fear and shock that she had experienced just seconds before.\n\nThat moment was short-lived.\n\nIn a series of events that had unfolded far quicker than Sylvia could process, she found herself face-to-face with a stern-looking Headmaster Mcgonagall. She paced the length of the room in silence for a while before finally addressing the shivering 11-year-old girl. \n\u201cDo you understand the severity of your actions today?\u201d\nSylvia\u2019s voice trembled,\u201d No, Headmaster. Was it because I scared Sydus and Emma?\u201d\n\nThe headmaster shook her head, \u201cNo, it is far more severe than that. Perhaps you didn\u2019t know, but the spell you cast today was one of a few Forbidden Spells.\u201d\n\nPanic filled her lungs,\u201d I swear, Headmaster, I swear I had no idea! Abra Cadabra is just something muggle magicians say when they preform their tricks and I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal and I swear I never meant to scare or hurt anyone! Sydus and Emma were saying I couldn\u2019t become a great wizard because I was muggle-born and I told them that muggles could do magic and they have magicians and I may have lied a bit, but I still didn\u2019t know that it was a forbidden spell!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have you know a forbidden spell can land you a one-way ticket to Azkaban?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t send me to Azkaban, Headmaster Mcgonagall! I promise I\u2019ll never do it again!\u201d Sylvia wasn\u2019t exactly sure what Azkaban was, but it certainly didn\u2019t sound pleasant. It sounded like a terrible detention hall where poor muggle-born girls that cast forbidden spell unknowingly were sent to. Where they were denied the necessities of life, like dessert, and had to subsist on only a dinner of toast and beans. It shook her to her very core. \n\nHeadmaster Mcgonagall sat down in her seat with a sigh. \u201cI suppose I can\u2019t punish you for not knowing, especially since you are muggle-born. I\u2019m quite surprised you managed to use the spell, talented, I\u2019ll give you that. For future reference, don\u2019t use a spell that you aren\u2019t familiar with. You could hurt somebody.\u201d\n\nSylvia\u2019s heart rose, it sounded like she wouldn\u2019t get in trouble after all!\n\n\u201cNow, you did destroy school property, so you still have to have some form of consequence.\u201d\n\nHeart sank.\n\n\u201cGo with Hagrid and retrieve the tree that you managed to send away.\u201d\n\n\u201cRetrieve it?? Where did it go??\u201d Sylvia responded, baffled.\n\n\u201cA terrible place.\u201d Headmaster Mcgonagall replied, eyes darkening.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n\u201cNow these, these creatures are arguably the most terrifying creature I\u2019ve met,\u201d Hagrid said, \u201cThey\u2019re proud things and think they\u2019re better than all the others of their species. Getting them to part with the tree will be a doozy.\u201d He pushed open the heavy wooden door, the scent of freshly ground coffee wafted out the door. Goblins, in some ways like the ones at gringotts, sat reading newspapers and sipping coffee from plain white mugs. In many ways though, they were much different from Gringotts goblins. They had thick beards, wore flannels and clothing that made them look somewhat like a lumberjack.

Who knew where he might have learned it.  To me it was just fun to say and sounded magical.\n\nI was only 11 years old and it was a world of wonder.  My father was Jewish and knew some Hebrew and once told me a literal translation was 'it came to pass as it was spoken'.  Growing up I was imaginative and always wished for magic to be real.  2 weeks ago an elegant letter was written to me and my childhood wish came true.  September 1st at 11:00am was less than a day away and I already read every book from that wonderful place called Diagon Alley.  There were no warnings about that word, just a warning that I was not to use my new wand and magic.\n\nAs I sat on my chair playing at my computer I held my wand and used it to type on the keyboard, it worked great as a stylus as well.  The nice gentleman at the wand shop said it was an extension of my will.

We were to meet one other family with a child like myself and then be whisked away to the train.  I pulled on my shoes and followed the man to say my goodbyes to my father.  I still played with my wand and found myself wishing my mother could be here as well and once again muttered that word as I flicked the wand into my hoodies pocket.\n\n\"Mom!  You are really here!\"  I cried out as she rushed to hold me.  It was then that those words came back to mind, the words my father taught me about the meaning of that word.  It came to pass as it was spoken and my wishes were coming true.  I stepped back from my mother's embrace, she should be in the hospital.  Last I visited she was too weak to even hold my hand.  My father was crying, it was something I only saw once before when my mother was diagnosed.\n\nWe finished our goodbyes and my guardian was staring at me with an urgency so we left with no more thought to how she could be here.  She sat in her favorite chair staring at her now trembling hands.  My father stood beside her with one hand on her shoulder and the tears continued to fall.  It was a happy day for everyone.  I learned later that my mother was back in the hospital.  Her diagnosis was rescinded, much to the amazement of her doctor, and only remained for minor testing before being released.\n\n\"I heard the word you spoke this morning.  I have to know, where did you learn to speak such an ancient word of the creators?\"  My guardian asked in a tone I was unfamiliar with.  \"No wizard has been able to figure out the method to make it work for over a millennia, and yet I fear you might have.\"\n\nThe words prompted me to grab my wand for comfort, I twirled it in the form of that balance pattern and from the recesses of my mind wished for a way to explain.  I spoke the word aloud and my guardian nodded in a reassuring manner and the explanation became clear.  Yet I was unable to tell him, a warning came out instead.  \"It is not my place or the time to share this mystery with you.  I am meant to only share this with the man from the future.\"  Even I did not yet know who this person would be.\n\nThe other family waved from across the street and jogged across to meet us.

I didn't buy the whole \"you're a wizard\" shtick at first but after the flying broom and hidden city in the middle of London, I just had to face that this was reality now, and adjustment is as hard as ever.\n\nApparently, there are more disadvantages than I thought being born from \"muggle\" (non-wizard) parents and entering the wizarding world. For instance, there are some things that you just can't say. Every wizard knows about the forbidden spells by the time they're ten, from news, books or friends at school. I was less fortunate.

There was no need to finish, as everyone in the room felt it simultaneously. We all had a wet spot in our sock.\n\nAt first, I wasn't too bothered. Some of the more sensitive students were groaning with discomfort but it slowly grew on me too. I ran to my temporary room and changed socks, but it was still there. Moments later, Bilbus rushes into the room asking what I've done. Before I can even answer, he sees the small pile of worn socks and the emotionless pain on my face and he knows.\n\nTomorrow I go on the train to Hogwarts. No one is talking to me and I doubt they will start. Half the kids still have the wet spots and those who don't know someone who does.

Imported from Montana, all the way in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d replied Jacob. He grasped the wand in his hands, and raised it in the air.

If you happen to know a simple charm, try using it.\u201d Jacob turned towards the lamp, directing his wand at the object focusedly. He thought of something to say, but he did not know any real spells. A memory of watching ridiculous magic tricks on television appeared in his mind. What did the magicians say? Some type of magic word\u2026\n\nJacob felt the wand begin to come to life, focusing its energy towards the tip, as if waiting for him to utter a phrase. The word popped into Jacob\u2019s head.

Ollivander\u2019s eyes widened to the point in which Jacob thought they would pop out. He stumbled backwards, tripping over a pile of wand boxes. \u201cDear God, boy, what have you done?\u201d he wailed, shielding his face.\nA bright green light started growing from the tip of his wand, shining brighter and brighter the longer Jacob held it. The color was a toxic green, how radioactive waste appears. Jacob tried to drop the wand, but his hand felt locked around the accursed object. Just as the light reached the point in which it was almost unbearable to look at, a burst of green energy shot from the wand, hitting the lantern squarely and bursting it into a million pieces. The explosion of the lamp sent a shockwave of pale light backwards, knocking Jacob off of his feet into the wand boxes.\n\nHis head hit the counter of the store hard, and he felt a welt beginning to form. As he slowly began to drift away into unconsciousness, a figure appeared in front of him: a woman wearing a pointed hat. She uttered a few words to Ollivander, who was just managing to stand, as Jacob fainted.\n\n\n\n\u201cRennervate!\u201d exclaimed a muffled voice. Jacob\u2019s eyes peeled open to reveal the blurry image of two women standing over him. One was wearing a nurse\u2019s outfit, similar to the ones he had seen from old World War II books. She was the one who cast the spell. Her friendly face smiled down at him.\n\nThe other woman was the one he had seen at Ollivander\u2019s. She was older, but had a stern disposition. Her clothes were a sharp black robe furnished with a black hat, one that looked like the stereotypical witch hat. Despite her severe look, she had faint smile lines behind her eyes, veiled under a heavy layer of evident physical stress.\n\n\u201cThank you, Madame Pomfrey,\u201d said the woman wearing black, authoritatively. \u201cI need to have a private word with Mr. Clifton, if you do not mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not, Headmistress,\u201d said the nurse, who quickly exited the room.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d said the woman. \u201cYou are lucky to be alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s lucky not to have the ministry all over our business too, if you ask me!\u201d cried a different, squeakier voice. Jacob craned his head around, but saw no one. \u201cDown here!\u201d He glanced down and saw a mat of hair sitting on a small man\u2019s large head.\n\n\u201cUm, my head hurts, and there\u2019s a bit of ringing in my ears. Other than that, it\u2019s not bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d said the lady. \u201cAllow us to introduce ourselves. I am Professor McGonagall, the headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The man you did not notice is Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. As I was aware, you were supposed to arrive at the school in two weeks, and preferably not in a stretcher.\u201d\n\nJacob groaned. He probably made a great impression on these two great witches and wizards, pulling a stunt and burdening them with having to deal with his injuries. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. \u201cI was set to arrive here on the first of September.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung man, do you have any idea the severity of the spell you just cast?\u201d Flitwick declared. \u201cThat is no magic that any eleven year old should even know of, let alone have the capability to cast!\u201d\n\n\u201cFilius, allow me. Mr. Clifton, are you aware of what you said?\u201d probed McGonagall gently.\n\n\u201cIt was something stupid. Something that you hear on cartoons or from books. It\u2019s a classical word that all magicians use. It\u2019s called abraca\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cShush!\u201d squeaked Flitwick. \u201cDo not say it in here!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is alright, Filius,\u201d assured McGonagall. \u201cI am aware of this. The word itself is a term muggles have used quite frequently throughout history. It is a corruption of the Killing Curse, repeated by muggles in an attempt to mimic the magic performed by witches and wizards. It is harmless if uttered by muggles, but unpredictable and quite possibly very dangerous if stated by a witch or wizard.\u201d\n\nNone of this made any sense, but part of what she said alarmed him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you say Killing Curse?\u201d\n\n\u201cA dark spell, not fit for first-years to be taught about. Perhaps Professor Weasley will bring it up in your fourth year of Defense Against the Dark Arts. In the meantime, answer me this: what was your intent upon the object you cast the spell on?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, um, tried to make the lantern disappear, like the magicians do,\u201d Jacob pondered. \u201cBut why does it matter? I said the word.\u201d\n\n\u201cMagic is not just about words, boy,\u201d Flitwick explained. \u201cWords help facilitate the passage of magic from your mind through the wand, but they are ultimately not necessary. Non-verbal magic is in fact a very common practice among accomplished wizards. Powerful spells are bred from both intent and skill. You trying to make that lamp disappear and your ease at destroying it in Ollivander\u2019s office is a sign of great potential, but also increases your need to have great caution in exercising your abilities. A lust for power only increases your desires to experiment with dark magic.\u201d\n\n\u201cDark magic runs rampant, even after the Dark Lord\u2019s fall. We must be ever watchful in case it decides to rear its ugly head again,\u201d McGonagall stated. \u201cHowever, you, young man, need to rest. We\u2019ll leave you at your bed to sleep.\u201d The two professors turned and began walking towards the door.\n\n\u201cOh, before I forget,\u201d said McGonagall as she shuffled through her robes. \u201cI believe this is yours.\u201d She pulled out the red wand from Ollivander\u2019s and tossed it to Jacob.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want it anymore after what happened,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t want another incident or explosion.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you better get on good terms with it. You\u2019re going to need it for the next seven years and the rest of your life.\u201d McGonagall turned around and opened the enormous oaken doors with a deafening creak. \u201cAnd please,\" she added, \"try not to kill yourself when we leave the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, professors,\u201d Jacob called to the two teachers as they strolled out of the hospital wing.\n\nJacob\u2019s head was swimming. He examined the wand gingerly, trying not to make a sudden movement as to set it off. The wand was beautiful still, but now he knew. The wand\u2019s beauty concealed a hidden power, a well of infinite possibilities that he had no idea even existed a few weeks ago. Jacob was still terrified of the piece of wood that almost killed him, but now he felt a sense of giddiness. Perhaps the wand was incredibly dangerous, but just maybe he was too.", "id": "daqnqen"}]]], "5ge890": ["[WP] Write a short story based off of the most recent dream you had that you can remember.", "2016-12-04 09:34:03", 12, "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5ge890/wp_write_a_short_story_based_off_of_the_most/", [[1, "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n"], [1, "She had such a nice house.\n\nI needed somewhere to stay.\n\nIt was perfect.\n\nSitting on the couch, I sat across from Mr and Mrs Boring, smiling sweetly at them as my mind ran over every minute detail of my surroundings.

He had kissed me good-night.  He even came upstairs to my apartment for tea.  We seemed to hit it off: we made good eye contact, he had put his hand on my leg at one point.  We laughed quite a bit while we were together.  We both worked for non-profit organizations and had studied human services in college.  I was hopeful, if not excited, when the date was over.  \n\nWe didn't make plans, per se, before he left my apartment.  We had talked about an eclectic music shop in the West Village that he liked to go to and I told him I would love to join him sometime.  He said, \"That would be nice,\" and smiled.  I figured we would go for a stroll through the West Village next week. \n\nWe both had family in Massachusetts that lived within a half hour from each other.  I figured we would be driving north to see family together, in the same rental car, within the next six months.  \n\nHe had curly brown hair and piercing blue eyes.  His eyes felt like ones that had stared out at the ocean for so long that they had absorbed some of its clarity and immensity.  He had grown up in Santa Monica.  He had lived in New York City for three years.  We met online.\n\nThe next day, I was so thrilled to have spent time with him, that I compulsively checked my phone throughout the day.  I figured that he was interested as well, had enjoyed himself with me, and would be checking in to remind me that last night was really nice.  \n\nNo phone call, no text message, no Facebook friend request.  I figured he was playing it coy.  He would be in touch tomorrow.  Or hey, maybe he actually had a busy day and instead of talking to me, he spent it just thinking about how cool I was.  I went to bed still excited to speak again.\n\nNothing the next day.  I waited until three days after our date to reach out to him.  I wasn't sure how to go about it: text, email, call.  I asked my friend Caitlin and she said I should man-up and pick up the phone.  So I did.\n\nVoicemail.\n\n\"Hi Bill, this is Carly.  Um.  It's Wednesday night, around 7:49 PM.

See you soon, call me back.\"\n\nI hung up feeling both empowered and rejected at the same time.\n\nThe night passed.  Ever. So. Slowly.  \n\nI watched TV and ordered take-out.  Once again checking my phone at least once every 5 minutes, even though it wasn't making any noise and the only person texting me was my mom.\n\nNothing.  \n\nI spent the next two days just imagining that he had lost his phone and was waiting for the phone insurance company to send his new one.  Or wait, maybe he had gotten hit by a car?  He may have been in the subway when I called.  It could have gone straight to voicemail and maybe he never checks his voicemail?\n\nHe would call me soon.\n\nOn the third day (sixth day since our date), I got his questionnaire in the mail.

He had kissed me good-night.  He even came upstairs to my apartment for tea.  We seemed to hit it off: we made good eye contact, he had put his hand on my leg at one point.  We laughed quite a bit while we were together.  We both worked for non-profit organizations and had studied human services in college.  I was hopeful, if not excited, when the date was over.  \n\nWe didn't make plans, per se, before he left my apartment.  We had talked about an eclectic music shop in the West Village that he liked to go to and I told him I would love to join him sometime.  He said, \"That would be nice,\" and smiled.  I figured we would go for a stroll through the West Village next week. \n\nWe both had family in Massachusetts that lived within a half hour from each other.  I figured we would be driving north to see family together, in the same rental car, within the next six months.  \n\nHe had curly brown hair and piercing blue eyes.  His eyes felt like ones that had stared out at the ocean for so long that they had absorbed some of its clarity and immensity.  He had grown up in Santa Monica.  He had lived in New York City for three years.  We met online.\n\nThe next day, I was so thrilled to have spent time with him, that I compulsively checked my phone throughout the day.  I figured that he was interested as well, had enjoyed himself with me, and would be checking in to remind me that last night was really nice.  \n\nNo phone call, no text message, no Facebook friend request.  I figured he was playing it coy.  He would be in touch tomorrow.  Or hey, maybe he actually had a busy day and instead of talking to me, he spent it just thinking about how cool I was.  I went to bed still excited to speak again.\n\nNothing the next day.  I waited until three days after our date to reach out to him.  I wasn't sure how to go about it: text, email, call.  I asked my friend Caitlin and she said I should man-up and pick up the phone.  So I did.\n\nVoicemail.\n\n\"Hi Bill, this is Carly.  Um.  It's Wednesday night, around 7:49 PM.  Just checking in to let you know I had a great time the other day.  Thank you for the date.  Um.  Hoping we could go out for coffee this week?  See you soon, call me back.\"\n\nI hung up feeling both empowered and rejected at the same time.\n\nThe night passed.  Ever. So. Slowly.  \n\nI watched TV and ordered take-out.  Once again checking my phone at least once every 5 minutes, even though it wasn't making any noise and the only person texting me was my mom.\n\nNothing.  \n\nI spent the next two days just imagining that he had lost his phone and was waiting for the phone insurance company to send his new one.  Or wait, maybe he had gotten hit by a car?  He may have been in the subway when I called.  It could have gone straight to voicemail and maybe he never checks his voicemail?\n\nHe would call me soon.\n\nOn the third day (sixth day since our date), I got his questionnaire in the mail.  I knew what it was as soon as I saw the envelope, addressed to me from the Department of Interpersonal Services.  \n\nI sat down on the couch, heart racing, unable to contain myself.

The lookout was only big enough for one of them at a time and Kimin was occupying it. \n\n\"They're just walking down the hallway. Wait ... They're opening the Green Door!\" Kimin said.

It was forbidden to pass the Green Door, though everyone knew children found their way past it now and then. Some were never heard from again.

If it weren't for the gray hair on some of them, everyone would have thought them to be no more than youths. \n\nThe Off-sir at the front, a tall man with very gray and many shiny bits on his very white jacket, spoke. \"We approach our destination!\" The lead Off-sir said. His voice echoed around the chamber impossibly loud and cause small children to cry and most of The People to cower. The Off-sirs looked surprised and talked quickly amongst themselves. Kimin held himself still out of brute force; he saw that Pinit never flinched and he wasn't going to be less brave than a girl.\n\n\"We approach our destination,\" The lead Off-sir spoke again but much more quietly this time. Still louder than any man's voice should be, but not so bowel-looseningly loud. \"Our time aboard this ship is coming to an end.\"\n\nThe People looked at each other. End? How could time here come to an end? Was this the Apocalypse? Mothers pulled their children close and husbands put their arms around their wives.

Clearly, whatever this Off-sir was saying was important to him and he acted as though delivering bad news but the details were lost on them. They asked each other if anyone knew what this meant. Would the food run out? Would their children be safe? Would they still have a home?\n\n\"They don't understand,\" Pinit said to Kimin. \n\n\"I don't understand either,\" said Kimin.\n\n\"This is a ship, right?\" Pinit asked. Kimin nodded. \"Well, ships travel places. From one place to the next place. Like the carts down on Deck Twelve?

Hangovers. What a pain in the head, am I right, readers? Yeah. *you sure that's not the cancer?* Yes me, I'm sure it's not the cancer. *That's* a nail-in-the-head stabby pain, whereas the feeling of my brain being trod on by the Hulk is definitely due to the gallon of Mimosas I drank. *fair enough.*  \nRight, now that's out of the way...  \n  \nI woke up with a Hangover, readers. Unusual for a man with a healing factor - after all, we normally just filter it out. I tell you, that Benedict Cucumberpatch can mix a *Strange* drink, eh? Still, that's what you get for bunking with a hobbit.  \nStill, I woke up in the DC universe. How'd I know it was DC? No Stan Lee. Those text boxes shouting \"Excelsior!\" are very distracting back home. That, and a man in his red undies flew past the window.  \n\"Who are you?\" Growled a voice behind me. I turned to find myself face to face with ole Batty Boy.  \n\"Batman! Big fan\" I gave him a little wave. It didn't seem to lighten the mood.  \n\"Loved you in the Killing Joke, although that *intimate*\" I waggles my eyebrows suggestively \"moment with Batgirl threw me right out.\" Batman frowned. Impressive considering his mask doesn't move.  \n\"I have never...\" his eyes narrowed \"ah. You're a Dimension walker.\"  \n\"Got it in one, Bats!\" I curtseyed. \"Wade Wilson, milord.\" I lowered my voice to the most gravelly growl I could *it sounded like a girl scout asking for cookies* shut it, I sounded like Ryan Reynolds doing a Nolan \"Although you can call me *The Goddamn Deadpool*\".  \nBatman nodded. \"Wilson, eh? That universe with Mr Fantastic and the like. Well, go home.\" I waved him down.  \n\"Nah, I kind of like it here Bats. You don't have one of me, and I'm filling the Gap.\"  \nBatman growled. Never heard a Bat growl before, but it is very impressive. He shoved a finger in his ear.  \n\"Watchtower, beam Wilson to me.\" Wait, Wilson? \"Yes, I take responsibility\" Is this Bat's volleyball? \"Now please.\"  \nA *whumm* occured and... I... joined us.  \n\"Deadpool, this is Deathstroke.\" Batman was almost pleasant. Very worrying. Like a kitten with a Machete. \"Your counterpart. Stay here and this is what you'll turn into.\"  \nI tell you readers, I shuddered. It was Liefeld at his worst. Pouches, pouches everywhere. And his *feet*... urgh. Not that again. Never again.  \n\"Fine, Bats, I'll go.\" I reached into my pouch...damn, it's already starting. Remember pockets, man. Pockets.  \nI reached into my...pocket... and pulled out my mimosa stained teleporter.  \n\"Ta-ra then, Bats. Happy hunting. And *you*...\" I turned to my counterpart, stunned by my loveliness, \"...lighten up would ya? You're putting the Wilson name to shame.\"  \nAnyway, I pressed the button and *blip!* ended up in this prompt. And if the author would *care* to allow it, I'll go. Go on, author. Yes, you, POTWP. Get me to press the button. Well done.  \n*Blip!*"], [17, "*Guh... where am I?* I grumbled. I looked around, and I wasn't in my room. *Huh.* The bed, the toilet, the concrete floors, and the bars... It appeared that I was inside a jail cell. I reached for my katana on my back, but of course it was taken. Along with all other arsenal I usually carried around with me. But they had some decency to leave my mask untouched. In fact, I was in my full costume--just minus the weapons. I raised myself up from the creaking bed and looked out through the window.\n\nFrom afar, the sign read: Belle Reve Penitentiary. Didn't ring a bell in my brain. I didn't know why, but although it was midday, but everything seemed so dark. And blue. And gritty. It looked like someone went through the trouble of going through everything in this penitentiary and tinted them all in blue plastic wraps. The space between the bars were big enough for some of me to go through. Which meant I could probably rip my body apart, throw them outside piece by piece, and assemble it together to make my great escape. But then again, I wanted to do the thing in the prison. You know, how you grab the bar with your both hands and you put your face between your clenched fists and then you stare into a distance with a sad face? Like, just look right into the camera. So, I did just that.\n\nA red light flickered and the alarm made a buzzing noise. There were some clanking sounds from a distance, and I heard a group of footsteps approaching toward the cell I was locked in. Well, I wasn't going to waste the perfect opportunity. I placed my ear to the floor and did the ninja technique of identifying footsteps. I'd like to believe it was a ninja jutsu or some shit like that. But then again, I remembered it's Native American thing. Honestly, that'd be okay too. Tot tot tot... There were at least four men with boots walking. With heavy firearms on their hands. And... one... woman... with high-heels? They bring lady here?\n\n\"What are you doing?\" said a voice. Well, she saw me pressing my head against the floor, so it was an awkward position to be seen upon. I had imagined that this was usually the part where the promiscuous, hot, fresh, and sexual lady in the charge of the facility talks to me a bit, falls in love with me Wade Wilson, and helps me escape. Although I will keep my chastity for my dear Vanessa. I can't miss out on what we do on International Women's Day.\n\n\"Be gone! You foul temptress!\" I shouted like an old wizard as I looked up. Well, I regretted saying that. The woman leading four armed guards was nothing I expected. She was somewhat fat, middle-aged, tired-eyed, black woman. Not that I have anything against the good folks of African-Americans. You just had to see her how she was the polar opposite side of magnet for men.\n\n\"Deadpool?\" She asked, in an authoritative manner. She hid not that she was the one in the charge. I fumbled myself up, and asked: \"How do you know my name?\"\n\n\"Deadpool it is. While you were severely intoxicated and went on with your murderous rampage on the cartel, you did claimed yourself to be Deadpool. Not to be confused with Deadshot.\" The woman responded. *Hmm*... I guessed that must been what must happened. There was an image of mafia kebab in my head that I couldn't recollect where I got that from, so that must've been from the last night, I figured. The woman cleared her throat. \n\n\"I am Amanda Waller. I saw how you fight against the cartel. Your regenerative abilities were quite impressive. Listen. I want to assemble a task force of the most dangerous people on the planet, who I think can do some good.\" said Amanda. *Well, okay, now I suddenly a superhero?* I thought. Wasn't that some turn of events! And I realized that must been why they left my mask on. 'cause I'm a brand new superhero to them! And Superheroes with capital S need their masks! I chuckled. But then again, things didn't make any sense. I was still in a jail cell.\n\n\"Hold on, ma'am, so you're hiring the criminals to do some dirty works?\" I asked. \n\n\"Precisely. The worst of the worst.\" She responded. \n\n\"So, a criminal death squad, huh?\" I said. \n\n\"No. Suicide Squad.\" She said. The name of suicide squad didn't ring a nice, fuzzy, warm feeling to me, but death was least of my worries nowadays. I wondered how other members of the Suicide Squad would feel about their name.\n\n\"May I ask who are the other guys then?\" I asked. Amanda turned to one of the guard and commanded him to inform me of what other criminals they had locked up here in the penitentiary with me. The guard listed a series of curious personnel:\n\nThere was Deadshot, who definitely was a big fan of me. He can shoot guns. Okay... Then, there's Harley Quinn. You mean harlequin? Anyway, she was a mentally unstable psychiatrist with a romantic history with another mentally unstable crime boss. With a baseball bat on her two strong hands. Wow, she must be so powerful. Then, there's Captain Boomerang. He did exactly what it said on the tin. Haha, what a joker this guard was. *He couldn't be serious?* I thought. He went on to describe a guy with crocodile skin. A Japanese swords-girl. Oh, and let's not forget the guy who can climb. Last and the least, a guy named Rick Flag would be overseeing the unit during operations.\n\nI couldn't believe it. What was it about those insane criminals that special forces couldn't do? A parasite of some sort must have been eating poor Amanda's brains out to think up of something so illogical and wacky and nonsensical. Or, she had a very bad writer and a very incompetent director. Or, worse yet, they were all just forced to do so by some greedy bastards in the studios. Regardless of the circumstance that brought them here, I didn't want to be a part of them.\n\nI thanked the guard for the service. Amanda Waller stated that she finished her business with me, and informed me I were to go out in the fields when I'm ordered to do so. *Aye, aye, ma'am.* I was smart enough to play along. Once I'm outside in whatever mission they give me, I'd just run away. There probably would be a bomb collar kind of thing involved, but unfortunately for them I'm sort of immune to death. So, kind of a big deal. Amanda Waller and the guards turned and started to walk away from the cell.\n\n\"Anyway, thanks for letting me have my mask on!\" I shouted.\n\n\"Your face was just too ugly to see.\" She responded without turning back.

Yeah. *you sure that's not the cancer?* Yes me, I'm sure it's not the cancer. *That's* a nail-in-the-head stabby pain, whereas the feeling of my brain being trod on by the Hulk is definitely due to the gallon of Mimosas I drank. *fair enough.*  \nRight, now that's out of the way...  \n  \nI woke up with a Hangover, readers. Unusual for a man with a healing factor - after all, we normally just filter it out. I tell you, that Benedict Cucumberpatch can mix a *Strange* drink, eh? Still, that's what you get for bunking with a hobbit.  \nStill, I woke up in the DC universe. How'd I know it was DC? No Stan Lee. Those text boxes shouting \"Excelsior!\" are very distracting back home. That, and a man in his red undies flew past the window.  \n\"Who are you?\" Growled a voice behind me. I turned to find myself face to face with ole Batty Boy.  \n\"Batman! Big fan\" I gave him a little wave. It didn't seem to lighten the mood.  \n\"Loved you in the Killing Joke, although that *intimate*\" I waggles my eyebrows suggestively \"moment with Batgirl threw me right out.\" Batman frowned. Impressive considering his mask doesn't move.  \n\"I have never...\" his eyes narrowed \"ah. You're a Dimension walker.\"  \n\"Got it in one, Bats!\" I curtseyed. \"Wade Wilson, milord.\" I lowered my voice to the most gravelly growl I could *it sounded like a girl scout asking for cookies* shut it, I sounded like Ryan Reynolds doing a Nolan \"Although you can call me *The Goddamn Deadpool*\".  \nBatman nodded. \"Wilson, eh? That universe with Mr Fantastic and the like. Well, go home.\" I waved him down.  \n\"Nah, I kind of like it here Bats. You don't have one of me, and I'm filling the Gap.\"  \nBatman growled. Never heard a Bat growl before, but it is very impressive. He shoved a finger in his ear.  \n\"Watchtower, beam Wilson to me.\" Wait, Wilson? \"Yes, I take responsibility\" Is this Bat's volleyball? \"Now please.\"  \nA *whumm* occured and... I... joined us.  \n\"Deadpool, this is Deathstroke.\" Batman was almost pleasant. Very worrying. Like a kitten with a Machete. \"Your counterpart. Stay here and this is what you'll turn into.\"  \nI tell you readers, I shuddered. It was Liefeld at his worst. Pouches, pouches everywhere. And his *feet*... urgh. Not that again.

It appeared that I was inside a jail cell. I reached for my katana on my back, but of course it was taken. Along with all other arsenal I usually carried around with me. But they had some decency to leave my mask untouched. In fact, I was in my full costume--just minus the weapons. I raised myself up from the creaking bed and looked out through the window.\n\nFrom afar, the sign read: Belle Reve Penitentiary. Didn't ring a bell in my brain. I didn't know why, but although it was midday, but everything seemed so dark. And blue. And gritty. It looked like someone went through the trouble of going through everything in this penitentiary and tinted them all in blue plastic wraps. The space between the bars were big enough for some of me to go through. Which meant I could probably rip my body apart, throw them outside piece by piece, and assemble it together to make my great escape. But then again, I wanted to do the thing in the prison. You know, how you grab the bar with your both hands and you put your face between your clenched fists and then you stare into a distance with a sad face? Like, just look right into the camera. So, I did just that.\n\nA red light flickered and the alarm made a buzzing noise. There were some clanking sounds from a distance, and I heard a group of footsteps approaching toward the cell I was locked in. Well, I wasn't going to waste the perfect opportunity. I placed my ear to the floor and did the ninja technique of identifying footsteps. I'd like to believe it was a ninja jutsu or some shit like that. But then again, I remembered it's Native American thing. Honestly, that'd be okay too. Tot tot tot... There were at least four men with boots walking. With heavy firearms on their hands. And... one... woman... with high-heels? They bring lady here?\n\n\"What are you doing?\" said a voice. Well, she saw me pressing my head against the floor, so it was an awkward position to be seen upon. I had imagined that this was usually the part where the promiscuous, hot, fresh, and sexual lady in the charge of the facility talks to me a bit, falls in love with me Wade Wilson, and helps me escape. Although I will keep my chastity for my dear Vanessa. I can't miss out on what we do on International Women's Day.\n\n\"Be gone! You foul temptress!\" I shouted like an old wizard as I looked up. Well, I regretted saying that. The woman leading four armed guards was nothing I expected. She was somewhat fat, middle-aged, tired-eyed, black woman. Not that I have anything against the good folks of African-Americans. You just had to see her how she was the polar opposite side of magnet for men.\n\n\"Deadpool?\" She asked, in an authoritative manner. She hid not that she was the one in the charge. I fumbled myself up, and asked: \"How do you know my name?\"\n\n\"Deadpool it is. While you were severely intoxicated and went on with your murderous rampage on the cartel, you did claimed yourself to be Deadpool. Not to be confused with Deadshot.\" The woman responded. *Hmm*... I guessed that must been what must happened. There was an image of mafia kebab in my head that I couldn't recollect where I got that from, so that must've been from the last night, I figured. The woman cleared her throat. \n\n\"I am Amanda Waller. I saw how you fight against the cartel. Your regenerative abilities were quite impressive. Listen. I want to assemble a task force of the most dangerous people on the planet, who I think can do some good.\" said Amanda. *Well, okay, now I suddenly a superhero?* I thought. Wasn't that some turn of events! And I realized that must been why they left my mask on. 'cause I'm a brand new superhero to them! And Superheroes with capital S need their masks! I chuckled.

I wonder if I will have more than 35000 karma you said trying to control your smile but you immediately lost any joy you had....\n\nYou called Jack and told him:\n- Jack, I'm in deep trouble.\n- No shit, he replied. I told you 100 times to read the article \"10 things not to post in reddit. Number 3 will shock you\". But you didn't listen. You never provide technical information in /r/DIY. You are going to get downvoted to oblivion.\n- Jack, I don't have time for this. I need to fix this. I will call you this afternoon.\n\nDear me, what am I going to do.\n\nYou started thinking for a plan. /r/aww was your best hope, it seemed fairly simple. Take cute pictures of cats and dogs and post them with relatively funny topics. This worked up to a point but it only offset about 1000 karma points. You were still well within the -8000 zone. In some posts you were even called out as a reposter making this even worse. But you carried on deep within the night while ignoring Jack's calls. It was almost morning again and suddenly you started realizing that this wasn't going to happen. All this time you were in a state of denial, now you were petrified. You stopped posting and looked out the window. Maybe they are already watching me you thought. You spent the next two hours doing nothing while Jack's messages kept coming in.\n\"Why have you stopped posting?\"\n\"Are you still there?\"\n\"Have they taken you?\"\n\"The guys and I are collecting donations. We have 200 karma. Please, respond\"\n\nReading Jack's messages took you to the next stage. Acceptance.\nScrew it you thought. If I'm going down, i'm going with a bang\nYou started frantically answering to your post replies. \n\n\"I'm not wrong. You are just stupid. I used to be a certified inspector what knowledge do you have on the subject kiddo\"\n\n\"Saying that because you have done it your self two or three times and nothing has happened to you shows how ignorant you are.

You through your table to the wall breaking the plywood. You were to tired and to angry to care any more. You simply closed the lights and fell asleep.\n\nSuddenly, you were awoken by a large bang. Before, you could even realize if it was all a dream somebody put a hood over head and tied your hands behind your back with plastic cuffs.\n\n\"Where are you taking me\" you screamed.\n\"Don't worry Mr. Jonson, it will soon be over\" you heard a voice.\n\nYou remained silent. It was actually true.\n\nAfter about an hour drive the car stopped. Quite abrupt actually. \"It must be one of those early self driving cars\" you thought. At this point you where left alone with your thoughts for such a long time you didn't care any more. You were simply thinking about how futile our live were after automation and basic income. Hell, you thought people go on \"joy rides\" with self driving cars. Just spinning around in a fully controlled environment. What's the point in that. In my days ferris wheels were for kids. I don't know what adults find in all this. Then you memberred  that time you were a safety inspector on a ferris wheel. You felt so responsible and made sure every thing was up to code. But now? Now what? I just sit around and collect basic income you thought. This live sucks. Let's get this over with you mumbled.\n\n- What was that Mr. Johnson? You heard a voice while somebody removed the hood over your head.\n- Let's get this over with. You said again, only this time loud and clear.\n- I am sorry Mr. Johnson, I am just a soldier. You will have to wait for the Sargent to explain.\n- Explain? Explain what?\n- I am sorry you will have to wait for the Sargent\n\nThis was getting stranger by the minute. What was there to explain? And were did this soldier come from? Soldiers went out of style only two years after basic income was introduced. And the car you where just into didn't seem like it was self driving. It seamed like a classic.\n\nFinally the Sargent arrived.\n\n- Good evening Mr. Johnson. How are you. You are probably wandering why you are here. You see we have been monitoring you for a long time. Your inability to integrate with modern automated society is very intriguing. \n- Why is it intriguing?\n- Well as you know much of our world is now automated and people leave out of basic income. This is a result of the treaty signed by our former president Mr. Trump at the end of his second term. The treaty that ended the 3 moth war with China.\n- Yes I am are of that.\n- Well there are some implication and terms signed in that treaty that are not available to the public.\n- Such as?\n- Well you see I was both the Chinese stand and our president's that handing over complete control to machines my be a huge risk. A risk so big that it almost caused the treaty not be signed.\n- Risk?\n- Yes, well you see if you allow artificial intelligence to control design and fabrication of new machines we might reach a state that we call \"The skynet\". Are you aware of the term.\n- Yes, I am a fan of the classics. But I thought the use of asimov's laws integrated in the design of the AI solved this problem.\n- Ah, you see this is what we led the public to believe. In reality is is impossible to a integrate a law that predicts everything. So this option was quickly scraped.\n- So? Are we in danger?\n- No. The reality is that we simply need to separate the design for the manufacturing process. Same concept with the constitutional authorities.\n- So we left the design to humans?\n- Not quite. Humans where unable to design such complex machines. All AI designs where far more detailed and precise.  But you see hand made machinery although slow to manufacture by skilled technicians are quite more accurate. Therefore, we leave the manufacturing process to humans.\n- Humans? You mean there are laborers right this moment building machines?\n- Precisely, this is one of the largest factory in the east coast with over 10000 workers.\n- 10000 workers? Are you serious. I thought workers where just 10 or 20 remaining hobbyist. \n- Not quite. You see we keep an eye on reddit. People, that cannot gain karma are more likely to have difficulties integrating with our society and who would be more happy working in a factory instead of sitting home\n- So why am I here again?\n- Well as we see here in your file you have extensive technical background working as a safety inspector. Is that correct?\n- Aha\n- Well we are in desperate need of people of your trade, so there are many openings. The job is yours. If you like it off course.\n\nA smile was drawn on your face.

I had just signed in, hair still messy and teeth unbrushed. A normal routine.

I don't know,\" I frowned, my hands starting to clam up and my heart beat speeding up faster.\n\n\"Did you post anything bad?\" Ped inquired. I shook my head, dumbfounded.\n\n\"No. Last comment I posted was in /r/aww about how cute a cat was. Would that put me under? I'm freaking out, Ped. What do I do?\" I replied, looking at my profile. I went to my recent comments tab and read down the line, not seeing anything that would fuck up my karma so bad. When I looked again, that's when I caught it. A comment I never made, or at least didn't remember making. *Score hidden. Click to see more.* Was in place of the upvotes. The comment was simple. \"What a disgusting creature,\" printed in big bold letters. I clicked on the post and almost screamed. I never said that.\n\n\"You there, shorty?\" Chimed in my good friend Travis.\n\n\"Someone hacked me.\" I replied, closing my eyes.\n\n\"What?\" The two replied in unison.\n\n\"Someone hacked me and edited my comment about the cute cat and called it disgusting. It's gotten over twelve thousand dislikes. And counting. Holy shit you guys, this is bad...\" I stated, leaning back in defeat. Everyone knew that people who had negative karma 'disappeared' from public. Never to be seen or heard ever again. My scummy ex boyfriend went on a drunk tangent one night and commented nasty things on different posts and posted some nasty things in different subreddits that got him negative, only to stop drunk calling and texting me two days later. No one has heard from him since. \n\n\"Someone's trying to murder you...\" Travis murmured. I swallowed the lump that had formed in my throat.\n\n\"Why? What did I do wrong?\" I asked. I had to get it back up. \"I gotta go, guys,\" I said. \n\n\"Where?\" Ped questioned.\n\n\"To get my karma back up,\" I replied through gritted teeth.

A single night of passion, admittedly some new experiences, a beautiful Gen Bot creature with an extraordinary brain as sharp as folded steel and the confidence to pursue HER desires as much as mine. Worth it? Y...no...NO! I was sick of having sex with robots and she was real. At least she was real. Not fucking worth my life though.\n\nNo one knew what happened to the Descended. No one. What I did know was this. Negative karma, lots of it, meant Gone; gone from your family, gone from your friends, your school, your work, gym, train and tram trips...abandoned cars and motorbikes left to rot at stations and libraries and homes or bikes at cafes and restaurants and bars that served everything except Euphoria. There were flowers , notes, cards...unopened cans or bottles of favourite booze for adults and naughty adolescents or a pop top juice for the Young Descended accompanied by burnt out candles in front of LED plaques placed at the Final Sighting. Those of us left behind did this for those of them taken. The Descended. Ha. I said us but soon I'll be them. Gone forever. Gone in two days. Gone. \n\nFuck. \n\nLet me tell you how I got here...42 hours, 56 minutes and some seconds from oblivion. It's Gen Bot's fault. Well, they're the blame game frontline anyway but really it evaporates up to the parenting of each generation prior, significant fault dating as far back as Gen X and even those baby boomer cum stains.\n\nTwo things I've learnt about Gen Bot - they have fuck all empathy and they think they're porn stars; most raised by robot nanny's (the surrogate MaDa V1 or V2) and most fucking their pet robot lovers from an inappropriate age and levelling up their kinks week by week until the only kink left was to fuck a real person with real smells and actual piss and shit and blood and cum. Fragranced fluids of robot lovers were replaced by the real thing, and this was a pivotal moment for all. Some turned their back on human lovers altogether, the \"beauty\" of a consensual loss of real virginity lost on the newly inducted woman or man of reality porn. They'd run back to their robot friend with benefits or robot friends with many benefits. Be it V1.1 antiques or V63.5 cutting edge sexperts. Many though, became instadickted to the very real interaction of real human to real human sex, authenticity awakening primal urges to do things to other humans. That's right, DO things TO other humans. Not make love, not even have sex. Do things. Not with, not for. To. Do things to.\n\nDo you know what the most common thing to do to people is?

This stuff is stupid.\n\nBut just before you where about to sleep, mechanically scrolling on your tablet's screen a post in /r/DIY caught your attention. Somebody replaced a power socket in his home.\n- He must be a mad man you thought!\n\nYou hastily opened the post while your heart was beating faster making you full alert. The cabling was quite old. From the days where cables where color coded instead of having their serial numbers printed on them. \n\"The cabling is old\" OP said.\n\"If I call the robot electrician company they wont be able to replace just the socket since the cables are so old and don't have a bar code on them. I will end up having to replace my whole cabling, not just the socket.

I wonder if I will have more than 35000 karma you said trying to control your smile but you immediately lost any joy you had....\n\nYou called Jack and told him:\n- Jack, I'm in deep trouble.\n- No shit, he replied.

It was actually true.\n\nAfter about an hour drive the car stopped. Quite abrupt actually. \"It must be one of those early self driving cars\" you thought.

Hell, you thought people go on \"joy rides\" with self driving cars. Just spinning around in a fully controlled environment. What's the point in that. In my days ferris wheels were for kids. I don't know what adults find in all this. Then you memberred  that time you were a safety inspector on a ferris wheel. You felt so responsible and made sure every thing was up to code. But now? Now what? I just sit around and collect basic income you thought. This live sucks. Let's get this over with you mumbled.\n\n- What was that Mr. Johnson? You heard a voice while somebody removed the hood over your head.\n- Let's get this over with. You said again, only this time loud and clear.\n- I am sorry Mr. Johnson, I am just a soldier. You will have to wait for the Sargent to explain.\n- Explain? Explain what?\n- I am sorry you will have to wait for the Sargent\n\nThis was getting stranger by the minute. What was there to explain? And were did this soldier come from? Soldiers went out of style only two years after basic income was introduced. And the car you where just into didn't seem like it was self driving. It seamed like a classic.\n\nFinally the Sargent arrived.\n\n- Good evening Mr. Johnson. How are you. You are probably wandering why you are here. You see we have been monitoring you for a long time. Your inability to integrate with modern automated society is very intriguing. \n- Why is it intriguing?\n- Well as you know much of our world is now automated and people leave out of basic income. This is a result of the treaty signed by our former president Mr. Trump at the end of his second term. The treaty that ended the 3 moth war with China.\n- Yes I am are of that.\n- Well there are some implication and terms signed in that treaty that are not available to the public.\n- Such as?\n- Well you see I was both the Chinese stand and our president's that handing over complete control to machines my be a huge risk. A risk so big that it almost caused the treaty not be signed.\n- Risk?\n- Yes, well you see if you allow artificial intelligence to control design and fabrication of new machines we might reach a state that we call \"The skynet\". Are you aware of the term.\n- Yes, I am a fan of the classics. But I thought the use of asimov's laws integrated in the design of the AI solved this problem.\n- Ah, you see this is what we led the public to believe. In reality is is impossible to a integrate a law that predicts everything. So this option was quickly scraped.\n- So? Are we in danger?\n- No. The reality is that we simply need to separate the design for the manufacturing process. Same concept with the constitutional authorities.\n- So we left the design to humans?\n- Not quite. Humans where unable to design such complex machines. All AI designs where far more detailed and precise.  But you see hand made machinery although slow to manufacture by skilled technicians are quite more accurate. Therefore, we leave the manufacturing process to humans.\n- Humans? You mean there are laborers right this moment building machines?\n- Precisely, this is one of the largest factory in the east coast with over 10000 workers.\n- 10000 workers? Are you serious. I thought workers where just 10 or 20 remaining hobbyist. \n- Not quite. You see we keep an eye on reddit. People, that cannot gain karma are more likely to have difficulties integrating with our society and who would be more happy working in a factory instead of sitting home\n- So why am I here again?\n- Well as we see here in your file you have extensive technical background working as a safety inspector. Is that correct?\n- Aha\n- Well we are in desperate need of people of your trade, so there are many openings. The job is yours. If you like it off course.\n\nA smile was drawn on your face.

It's gotten over twelve thousand dislikes. And counting. Holy shit you guys, this is bad...\" I stated, leaning back in defeat. Everyone knew that people who had negative karma 'disappeared' from public. Never to be seen or heard ever again. My scummy ex boyfriend went on a drunk tangent one night and commented nasty things on different posts and posted some nasty things in different subreddits that got him negative, only to stop drunk calling and texting me two days later. No one has heard from him since. \n\n\"Someone's trying to murder you...\" Travis murmured. I swallowed the lump that had formed in my throat.\n\n\"Why? What did I do wrong?\" I asked.

A single night of passion, admittedly some new experiences, a beautiful Gen Bot creature with an extraordinary brain as sharp as folded steel and the confidence to pursue HER desires as much as mine. Worth it? Y...no...NO! I was sick of having sex with robots and she was real. At least she was real. Not fucking worth my life though.\n\nNo one knew what happened to the Descended. No one. What I did know was this. Negative karma, lots of it, meant Gone; gone from your family, gone from your friends, your school, your work, gym, train and tram trips...abandoned cars and motorbikes left to rot at stations and libraries and homes or bikes at cafes and restaurants and bars that served everything except Euphoria. There were flowers , notes, cards...unopened cans or bottles of favourite booze for adults and naughty adolescents or a pop top juice for the Young Descended accompanied by burnt out candles in front of LED plaques placed at the Final Sighting. Those of us left behind did this for those of them taken. The Descended. Ha. I said us but soon I'll be them. Gone forever. Gone in two days. Gone. \n\nFuck. \n\nLet me tell you how I got here...42 hours, 56 minutes and some seconds from oblivion. It's Gen Bot's fault. Well, they're the blame game frontline anyway but really it evaporates up to the parenting of each generation prior, significant fault dating as far back as Gen X and even those baby boomer cum stains.\n\nTwo things I've learnt about Gen Bot - they have fuck all empathy and they think they're porn stars; most raised by robot nanny's (the surrogate MaDa V1 or V2) and most fucking their pet robot lovers from an inappropriate age and levelling up their kinks week by week until the only kink left was to fuck a real person with real smells and actual piss and shit and blood and cum. Fragranced fluids of robot lovers were replaced by the real thing, and this was a pivotal moment for all. Some turned their back on human lovers altogether, the \"beauty\" of a consensual loss of real virginity lost on the newly inducted woman or man of reality porn. They'd run back to their robot friend with benefits or robot friends with many benefits. Be it V1.1 antiques or V63.5 cutting edge sexperts. Many though, became instadickted to the very real interaction of real human to real human sex, authenticity awakening primal urges to do things to other humans. That's right, DO things TO other humans. Not make love, not even have sex. Do things. Not with, not for. To. Do things to.\n\nDo you know what the most common thing to do to people is? It's sabotaging their real lives by sabotaging their reddit lives...\n\nChloe, the authentic Gen Bot cunt that levelled up my authentic kink meter to deep red overnight must have posted something terrible from my account.

Seducing Mrs. S, collapsing her family, leaving her for Mr. S, then leaving him for the new girl, Jane, up the street. Planting insane gardens that took up the entire plot of land, having a kid and locking him in the house as child services try to find a way in, and then burning the whole house down to bring a tragic end to it all. Ah... memories. \n\nThe installation went smoothly and I began to create my first family. I wanted to start as a fresh new bachelor and work my way up to the big leagues. \n\nWho would I seduce first? My fingers tingled with excitement.\n\nAfter the screen loaded, though, I wasn't alone in the house. In fact, my character wasn't who I created. There was an entire family, a man, women and child. I assumed the game made an error and restarted, but again, the same thing. \n\nI was disappointed, to say the least. I told myself this could still be fun, and if I wanted, I could just have the child taken away and divorce the wife and everything would be okay. Honestly, the game looked a lot more realistic than I remembered before, I was almost certain the kid was about 2 years old and the parents were in their early 30's. \n\nThings began like normal. Dad went to work, mom took care of the kid and I barely had any money to keep their happiness and fun up. I made the dad read more, gave him a gym and a chess board. He was going to work his way up the military ladder; I remembered the pay was excellent. \n\nThen one of the AI's started showing up. Only when the mom was out. She would come over and play with the little boy and then one day, she and the dad kissed. They went into the bedroom, kissed and went to the bed to have sex. I couldn't believe it, I didn't even tell him to do it! This AI was amazing! It would kickstart my whole plan to make him a bachelor again.\n\nThings continued like this for awhile: the dad went to work, improved his stats, received promotions, slept with the random girl when the mom was out and I had enough money to really improve the house. I was ready to blow this whole thing up and today it was perfect. \n\nThe mom was still in the house, the adulteress was walking down the sidewalk and the dad was working out. The adulteress went around the back of the house and waited. She wasn't going to hide that easily. I told the mom to go out and start BBQing and the dad to go kiss his femme fatale. \n\nThey didn't... I slammed my fist against my desk. What the hell was wrong with this game? The mom left the house and the lady came in, then the dad kissed her. Not what I wanted! They walked to the bedroom again, and I knew they would start having sex. They did, but then the kid walked in. \n\nMy blood ran cold. I noticed above the headboard there was a painting in the game of a loon gliding across a smooth lake's water. The same painting at my mother's house... The adulteress had something familiar about her too. The jet black hair. \n\nThen it happened. I remembered. \n\nWhen I was a kid I walked in, trying to find mom. When I opened the door and asked, this lady was on top of my dad... I fast forwarded the timer.\n\nThe same routine continued, until a month later when, I guess it was my mom, had found out and was yelling at my dad. They screamed and my dad threw a plate against the wall before storming out of the house. I watched my mom crawl up beside the broken pieces and cry. I watched the AI do what I knew was going to happen.\n\nI remembered, clear as day, walking up to her that day. I sat down beside her as she cried. Whenever I cried she gave me my teddy bear, Mr. Cuddles and that day I gave him to her. \n\nAs I watched the animation of me lean up beside her, the game slowly fizzled out and a \u201cgame over\u201d screen appeared. Feelings of regret and reminiscence took me. It had been awhile since I last talked to my mother. Things were busy lately (as busy as they can be when you decide to play a video game instead of calling your mother) and I knew my father was a scumbag, but she never told me what happened. I figured he just left\u2014he was always flakey anyway. But in all those years of raising me, I never knew the full sadness she carried. So I picked up the phone and dialed her number.\n\n\u201cJeffery! What a treat to hear from you! What have you been up to?\u201d she answered.\n\n\u201cWell first off, I just wanted you to know I love and miss you, but other than that, nothing,\u201d I joked. She laughed and we talked for the next hour. It was simple, but I think it made today a little more cheerful for the both of us.   \n\n\nEdit: Added to the ending. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nMore stories at /r/ItsPronouncedGif. Thank you so much for reading!"], [261, "Ethan couldn\u2019t wait to try out the game - from what he\u2019d seen of the trailers, the graphics were eerily realistic. Though Sims 4 had been good, it had never been *quite* realistic enough for him. \n\nWhen he got home and popped in the CD, he began jotting out his plans for his first family. He couldn\u2019t wait to get started. He built the house carefully: a pool surrounding them, a nice, roomy basement. A family of eight, six of them children. \n\nAt first, it was the same as usual. His sims' needs plummeted as he deprived them of food and sleep. It was fun, but not exactly anything new. \n\nIt was only when they started working together on their own, to escape the basement, that he begun to wonder. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. One of the drawbacks of the game - they were just stupid, simulated people, doing exactly what he told them. Not like real people. *Real* people would act like this, would try to escape. \n\nHis hands trembled with excitement as he tried to direct them. Some - like the smallest children - obeyed, while others appeared to be screaming directly at him. One of the parents refused to attack his own children like he\u2019d ordered, instead breaking down in tears on the floor. \n\nThere could only be one explanation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all real, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re real,\u201d he whispered, leaning back from the computer as he considered the implications of this.\n\nIf they were real, did that mean he was God? He\u2019d always suspected, but this was surely a sign\u2026a signal. He turned his eyes on the sims again. Feverishly, lost in the dark world he had been afraid to imagine up to this point, he began to play in earnest.\n\n-----------\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got something, sir,\u201d agent Katherine Masters said, showing her supervisor the live feed of one of the webcams.\n\nA pale-faced young man\u2019s eyes were lit with joy as he tortured a family of eight.\n\n\u201cGood job, Katherine,\u201d agent Daniel Simmons murmured, hastening over to check the feed for himself.\n\nAs always, he felt slightly nauseous as he watched the man\u2019s enraptured expression. \n\nRight from the start, the Sadism Identification Mechanism operation had been a massive pain in the ass to get approved and implemented. First there was the game\u2019s development. It had been a long, tedious slog, to get the coding perfect - to make the sims behave as unpredictably as possible.\n\nThen the marketing - its number of sales were crucial to their operation\u2019s success. And above all, getting approval to hack into the players\u2019 webcams. It would be a disaster if details of the operation became public, even though they abandoned most of the feeds after a week. Watching someone direct their sims to go to work and make pancakes was hardly a good use of their resources.\n\nBut then there were others. \n\nThe ones who made the red tape and headaches worth it. The ones who proved that the game could be a revolutionary tool to catch some perpetrators early. Those who would likely move on from torturing highly realistic, simulated people - to real people.\n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got the address?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cAll his details,\u201d Katherine confirmed.\n\n\u201cKeep watching him,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cWe need more.\"\n\nKatherine started to reply, when they heard Ethan whisper something in a fervent tone, like he was praying. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all real, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re real,\u201d he said. Instead of seeming uneasy, the boy looked ecstatic.\n\n\u201cDelusions,\u201d Daniel noted. \u201cInteresting. Focus only on him for now, Katherine.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, stifling a sigh. It was draining work, looking into these people\u2019s eyes when they thought no-one was watching. It had already been a pain with the previous games. But somehow, the things she saw only got worse as the games got more realistic. People got increasingly carried away as they dreamt they could control actual people.\n\n\"Yesss! I'm God!\" Ethan was whispering to himself as he drowned two of his sims in the pool, while another was consumed by flames in the kitchen.\n\nKatherine made a note of that, shaking her head as she took a sip of coffee. The number of people who immediately jumped to *that* conclusion was rather disturbing.\n\n--------\nHope you enjoyed my story!

And I was a prime volunteer. \n\nThe combination of street performers, open drinking laws, magical Mardi Gras beads, and bourbon street almost guaranteed a blackout whenever I took a vacation there- and if they didn't, they the buddies I brought along with me would help push me over the edge. Hell, the last time we went I remember boarding the plane to get there, and I remember getting on the plane to leave. But absolutely nothing in between. \n\nWhich was why I was surprised unpacking my bags by a small case tossed into a side pocket, with a disk inside. And stapled to the front, almost in a gruesome manner, was a receipt from *Vick's VooDoo*, made out by scrawling handwriting, with a row of symbols along the bottom. \n\nI'd stayed home from work that day, the hangover from the trip still pounding in my head, my stomach releasing smells long since declared illegal by the Geneva convention. And with nothing better to do, I popped the game in my computer, and I began to play. \n\nI'd never played the Sims, but I'd seen it done, and I knew how it worked. It would be best to start with something easy, a family I could model without much trouble.\n\nSo I settled on the neighbors, Jim and Martha. Late thirties, boring people actually- for the past six weeks, Jim had been trying to put together an apartment complex wide barnecue for the forth of July, and I was certain he would consider it one of his top achievements. Maybe even make a spot of his resume. \n\nSo in the game, I had him buy a grill and party supplies, easily outstripping their measly budget. And as I yawned, and prepared for bed, I found him a new job so his barbecue could have additional funding, and not be as lame as real life. Two times his current income- still nothing amazing, but for a man like Jim, he had struck gold. \n\nAnd walking to my car the next morning, Jim bumped into me at the bottom of the stairs as we excited the building, and walked over to a car parked in between two spaces, straddling the white line to provide more space. \n\n\"You're looking!,\" he said proudly, slapping the hood, \"Of a proud owner of a new Honda Civic! Drives like a champ, and let me tell you that those Chinese Engineers really know how to drive up those MPG's!\"\n\nHe grinned, and waited for my acknowledgment, his eyes searching. Only Jim would need his neighbor's approval for buying a new car, especially a civic. \n\n\"Cool stuff, Jim\", I answered as I stepped into my own car, \"how'd you swing that?\"\n\n\"New job at the plant!\" He shouted back, \"And whewee, did it come with extra green!\"\n\n\"Congrats,\" I muttered, and started to close the door, cutting off his words. \n\n\"And don't forget this next weekend is the barbecue- I bought a new grill and-\"\n\nBut the door was shut, and I was already on my morning grind. And it wasn't until the second stoplight that the realization hit me. The thought pulled at me all day at work until I clocked out that day, and I fired up The Sims. And I put my theory to the test. \n\nThe walls between out apartment were thin- so thin, I could often hear snippets of speech. And I experimented. \n\nI clicked *argue*, and Jim's voice would float over about how his wife should make potato salad instead of mashed potatoes for the barbecue, and he *did not give s damn* whether she had won blue ribbon ten years before at the fair for her Tater Tornado. \n\nThen I could make them high five in the heat of it, the stands coming through the drywall. \n\nAnd I heard the make up sex I commanded, probably their first in years, the sounds cringeworthy as I decided never to select that option again. But I smiled, looking at the receipt from Vick's Voodoo on the ground, and reading the text for the first time. \n\n\"*You may not remember me, but I'll remember you, Mr. Tim. Take this, as a parting gift. A way of giving you what you have earned.*\n\nAnd on the computer, I selected *New Game*, buying my lip in thought of who I should choose next. Names flitted through my head as my fingers itched at the keys- Zuckerburg or Gates who could leave me gifts, a few of my exes for what they deserved, GRR Martin who I could confine to his study until he actually wrote a damn book, The Cubs Team so they could finally win the World Series- the list went on for nearly ten minutes. Then I typed a name, and hit enter, adrenaline rushing as the screen began to load. \n\nBut not before cancelling Jim's barbecue. \n\n*** \n\nBy Leo\n\n"], [58, "After installing the game, it requires me to log in with my Origin account.

I'd been waiting for this for *years,* Father always thought I was too young for games and control like this, but for my birthday He finally gave in and bought me the game.  \n\nI put in the disc and the game loaded and prompted me to choose my character. I couldn't customize him though, only put in preferences. Fine. I would start with a family, one man one woman and two young children, your average family. \n\nThe screen showed the globe spinning and then stopped and zoomed into a family in some suburb in America I think it's called. Father always chastised me for not knowing geography, said it was important to know these things but it just didn't settle in, so many names, so many divisions. \n\nAnyways, I was looking down at a house from the top, the family was having dinner together. They were talking and joking and laughing. It was wonderful. I didn't even do anything then, just listened to them talk, joke. Father and I had fun yes, but I had no one else, all the people who worked for Father were really serious and not very fun. I wondered what it would be like to have my own brother or sister. \n\nAll the time I marveled at the care that must have gone into making a game like this, it all seemed so *real.* Once everyone went to bed I fast forwarded to the morning, still not doing anything. The kids went to the bus and off to learn, and the father kissed his wife and went to work. The mother stayed home and I watched her cooking and cleaning...normal things. But then there was knock on the door. \n\nThe mother went to open it and a man came in. It wasn't the father. They kissed and went to the bedroom. I knew what that meant, Father never told me, but I found out, overheard things. I was angry. Why would she do this? She has such a happy family! I tried to tell her to stop, told the guy to go away...it didn't work. Was this game broken?\n\nResolved, I went to the father to tell him to come home. I shifted the screen to the office to find him driving back already, he looked really angry. He must've found out without me! I watched as the father drove homewards, so angry. I knew it was a game, but again, it felt really real. \n\nI saw what was about to happen a moment before it did. He wasn't going to stop at the light. I knew about traffic lights see, I was really interested in human electronics. I knew he had to stop, that it was dangerous not to. I tried to control him, but again, the character didn't obey, and he drove past the light...into a truck.\n\nDead on impact.\n\nNo...no. Why was this happening? I closed the computer angrily, I didn't want to see the kids come home, find out what had happened, find out what the mother would go through. \n\nI went to Father.\n\nHe was sitting at his chair as usual, looking at the globe. But he looked up when I came in in tears. \n\n\"You tricked me!\" I accused. He always did this, put me through tests, to make me ready he said. To take over his job. \n\nHe smiled at me, he always smiled, and I hated it. Because whenever he smiled my anger melted away. \"I'm sorry, son,\" he said in a booming voice, \"but I had to...you have to learn.\" \n\n\"Learn what?\" I protested, \"learn to watch tragedy, to watch the worst in people?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Father said, \"but a bit more.\"\n\nI started to say something but Father held up a hand. \"You must learn to give free will. It is not our job to interfere, to make everything better, our job is to give choice, to let the normal flow of things happen. You must learn not to take away free will whatever the consequences. It is the only rule we have.\"\n\n\"But what if it makes them sad?\" I protested. \n\nFather smiled again, \"In the end, son, when they come to us, they'll all be happy.\"\n\n***\n(Author's note: if you didn't get it (or simply because it wasn't clear), the Father (denoted by the capital letter) is supposed to be a God of some sort, with the son one day to replace him.)\n\nIf you enjoyed, check out my new subreddit [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/)\n    "], [29, "I kicked my legs up and got comfy, placing the keyboard on my lap and starting up the game. I'd been playing Sims 5 everyday now for the past three years. At first, when I saw it there in the used PC games section I thought it was a joke. I couldn't find any mention of it on Steam, there wasn't hundreds of dollars of DLC discs that I knew of, just a used game that apparently didn't exist. On sale for a dollar.\n\nI bought it on a whim. It was just a dollar, what did I have to lose? It was probably a copy of the original Sims just re-wrapped to trick people. Probably someone hoping I'd post a picture of it on reddit asking \"Who did this?\"\n\nI destroyed four families before I realized it wasn't a game.\n\nWhen I booted it up, the graphics were next-gen. Better than next gen, actually, which surprised me since my PC couldn't run Sims 3 without occasional lag. There was no longer a create-a-sim option, just a selection list, a search function or a \"Select Random Family\" button. And there weren't any made up towns anymore, the game was *global*. I could select families in China, the U.S, Australia... I thought they were just going for that \"progressive diversity\" thing they started with the whole gender update in Sims 4 and thought nothing of it. The only difference was a coloured difficulty rating for each family. Families in China had a difficulty ranging from Green to Orange depending on where they were, American first world families rarely dropped below Yellow difficulty while third world families rarely got better than an Orange rating.\n\nI shrugged and went with easy. I chose a family from my home town just for giggles. They tanked right away. I accessed the cheat console to find out if 'Motherlode' still worked, which it did, and proceeded to try to deck out the house. By the next day police appeared and arrested the father on suspicion of tax fraud. It confused me at first but I figured it was some sort of cheat detection thing. The next family went a little smoother. Apparently there was the option to access bank accounts and direct money into offshore accounts that prevented my Sims from being arrested, so I took full advantage of it.\n\nThis was a family had no kids, so I quickly started trying to max their stats I quit their jobs and made the wife run non-stop on the treadmill to build cardio, accessing the debug menu to keep her mood maxed. I had the husband sit in front of his laptop and write novels all day, hoping to max out the revenue so I'd rely less on Motherlode for money.\n\nThe were dead in three days. A notification told me it was dehydration.\n\nThat was when the game started to annoy me. Why would they limit cheating? It made no sense! I tested another two families before giving up for the evening. Too much was different. Building extensions to homes required builders, which too time even if you sped the game to it's highest in-game speed so I demolished the whole house out of spite and found another family. I decided to test what would get me killed with that one. It was a wife, husband and a teenage son & daughter.\n\nI placed the son in his room, deleted the windows and doors and maxed the mood. Dead from dehydration in three days. I did the same to the daughter, but this time I didn't max out moods. It was the usual. Stamping, screaming, wetting themselves, but it got too real and intense. Now they wouldn't just wet themselves, there was defecation. There was pounding and screaming on the walls *seriously* debuffed the mood of the parents. I ended up maxing the moods just so she'd die a little quieter.\n\nThe weirdest part at the time was that the bodies wouldn't disappear and turn into urns. Apparently there was a whole body disposal system now. I tried to build a door to the rooms, but a warning appeared.\n\n*Warning: Calling in other Sims while the bodies of Sims that have died due to negligence are present may result in arrest. Do you want to call in other Sims or would you like your Sims to attempt to complete this task. Skill training in repair affects success.*\n\nI shrugged. It made sense, so I made the parents demolish the wall and removed static moods to see what the effect would be. The moment they found the son they both plummeted in mood. The mother wouldn't stop crying over the body and the father ignored all commands and started knocking down the wall to the daughters room. When he found her body the screen flashed.\n\n*One of your Sims is suffering a mental break: Homicidal Rage.*\n\nI laughed at that. Apparently EA was ripping off RimWorld now. I watched the father calmly walk over to a liquor cabinet, take a drink and then unlock a gun safe I didn't even realize was there. He then went over to his wife and shot her pointblank in the back of the head.\n\nI stopped giggling.\n\nHe then went to his laptop, wrote for a moment, and then shot himself. I shut off the game. That was just taking things too far. This obviously had to be some fan game, there was no way EA would include something like that. I shook it off, had a beer to take the bad taste out of my mouth and went to bed.\n\nIt was at work the next day that I got the news. A family that had apparently locked their children away, letting them die of dehydration. The cops had been alerted to gunfire the previous evening finding that the husband had killed himself and his wife in an apparent murder-suicide. My hometown was in shock. Me? I was in a daze. I started googling the names of the previous Sims I had played. One was arrested two days earlier on suspicions of tax fraud, another couple was found dead under mysterious circumstances. One was suing a construction company for completely demolishing their home.\n\nIt was like I'd found the Death Note. I was dumbfounded. Was I a murderer? Had I killed those people? The reports said this had happened several days ago, so how could that be? And the bodies...\n\nI stopped.\n\nThe Grim Reaper had collected their souls just like the other games. That couldn't have been real, could it? I excused myself from work and went home, claiming illness, and just cried. I cried for hours. I couldn't decide whether to tell anyone or not. Who would believe me? Eventually tears gave way to laughter. I had to be imagining things, didn't I? There was no way that I could have so much...\n\nPower.

The instructions were so accurate I could almost gone out to the street and perform the killing without a gun, because I could tell exactly how the body would behave. My reward rendered all codes obsolete, but I was no longer surprised. The Sims 5 was almost too good to be true. Almost boring. I was the spitting image of the picture created by fiction writers. Went to the same places. Killed the same people. I started to notice a pattern, because I could no longer choose wether to accept the jobs or which weapon to use. It was like an AI with a mind of its own. It was still fun. Only predictable. *What do you want to do next?* I smiled. I wanted to chase the good guys. I followed the map which led me through desert streets and my next target was a bombist. *What?* Maybe I need to tell Electronic Arts that bombist are not very friendly people. Then the screen goes blank again. *Did I saved the game?* Apparently I never stopped playing, because I found myself inside the targeted building staring at my bombist. My instructions were clear: *aim straight behind the head for the cerebellum and spinal cord so it destroys am much brain mass as possible*. I pressed the button and calmly left the building. The cops sirens start ringing but I\u2019m already out of reach. The annoying sound fades in the background as I collect my reward: Half a million dollars. Not bad for a rookie! Suddenly I hear the sirens again. My heart starts pounding. *Were are they?* But they are nowhere to be found. I look at every possible direction several times, but I am all alone. And the sound keeps getting louder and louder. I slowly turn back, only to see the TV recreating the nightmare I had just escaped. The panic in the building. The police looking for the killer. The bullet I was missing in the head of a friend.\n"], [1, "\"I need a game that a kid would like!\" he shouted frantically as he entered the store, \"A little girl.\"\n\"X-box or play station?\" barked the clerk from across the store.\n\"Neither\" he shouted back\n\"We have a sale on consoles right now. That would be a great gift\" \n\"I'm not buying her a damn console. Something cheap she'll like,\" he said, getting frustrated, \"And quickly, please.\"\n\"Here, Sims. Just came out,\" The clerk said, game in hand, \"It'll run on any computer from this decade.\"\n\"Great! I'll take it. Can you wrap it?\" he said, checking his watch.\n\n\"Fuck.\"\n\"FUCK!\" \nJames bashed his steering wheel. This was not the first time that he had fucked up; but forgetting his own daughter's birthday. That was truly a new low. He left work early, trying to surpise her by coming home before her, hopefully a nice gesture. \n\nAs he pulled up to his small house and ran inside. He checked his watch, 3:20. \"They should be back,\" he said as he marched through the door. But nothing.\n\nThe house was empty, and in the kitchen he saw a note propped up against a dozen empty bottles. He opened it and it read \"I'm leaving and I'm taking Lizzy. Don't try to find us.\" His heart dropped. \"No!\" he shouted. \n\nHe ran up the stairs to find his room a mess and his closet empty. In his daughters room, nothing. Even the bed sheets were gone. \"Her mother,\" he whispered, they have to be there. He dialed her number, then again, and again. No answer. \"Fuck!\" he yelled for no one to hear. \"Did she give her the idea. That bitch never liked me. Fuck!\" He almost drove to her house before remembering the note.\n\nThe shock faded and terror set in. It was over, everything was over. He willed himself to move, step by step, to the garage, pulling one bottle of scotch and drinking as much as he could before heading to the tv. Every part of his body shivered with anxiety as he took another sip from the bottle. His nightly routine started a bit early tonight. \n\nHe woke up with a gun in his hand. He thought to himself exactly what he had planned to do with it. Awful was the thought that he was going to kill himself, but he was physically repulsed when he thought what he might've done to his wife. The wife he knew he loved, but hated.\n\nThat was it. He poured the entire case down the drain, along with anything he had in the fridge. He was cutting out the single thing that ruined his life. That ruined him. \n\nThe first night was easy, the second harder. He took the week off work hoping less stress would make it easier, but it gave him little to do. \"Life is boring when you stop drinking,\" he thought to himself with a smirk on his face. \n\nHe threw the game into the computer. \"'Anything from this decade,' thats what he said.\" Then the game booted up. He had played once before, his daughter showed him the family she had built. He remembered feeling weird when she used the word. \"You dont built a family.\"\n\nThen, with no warning, the game started. Voices faintly spoke from the machine as images of people walked around a 3 story house. \"If only it was that easy.\" He explored the game, doing the things his daughter had showed him. Making the family cook, clean, work. Motonous daily activities. He hated it. \n\nJames left for the TV. Less thought. He figured that getting through the day was all that was important, and without thinking he could get through the day. But after an eternity of stupid shows, sports, and news he checked the clock. 10:30. \"Fuck,\" he whispered to himself. James had began to realize how often he had said that. \n\nSo he went back to the computer. The game was still running, and he saw the computer person doing something perculiur; it was taking a smoke break. A game for kids, and it was smoking. But James had another idea, he could use this character to do all the things that he had never done.\n\nFirst was smoking. He was still baffled that this \"thing\" would smoke in a kids game. Next was... nothing. He watched this thing sitting at a desk for almost ten minutes before he could even think of something to make it do. \"A casino,\" he thought. He had never gambeled with anything other than scratch-offs.\n\n He had the thing leave the building and drive to the casino. Hours of loosing before James had realized that there was no point to a virtual casino. There is nothing to win. Nothing real he can loose. So he decided to leave. Both the game and James' world were dark. As the thing walked out, he was propositioned. \"Ten buck for a joint,\" the shady looking man said audibly through the game. Dumbfounded, James decided to take it. Smoking pot was another thing he had never done. The game became odd. Oddly accurate. The man's driving was significantly worse, and speaking to his wife was slower and more incoherent than anything said before. \n\n\"A fucking kids game\" he shouted. Then anxiety washed over him when he remembered why he had bought the game in the first place. He wanted a drink. But that was what got him here in the first place. \n\nThen he got back to the game. Realizing that he could controll the entire family, Husband, wife, and son, he switched to the wife. She was cooking dinner when the husband came home. She had stopped to yell at the husband for smoking, and the pot on the stove began to boil over. \"Go and fix it,\" he commanded. But then another thought. Why did he make her do that. There are no repercussion, nothing of value can be lost. The game was like the casino. So he decided to go a different route with his playing. Not things he would want to do, but rather things he would never do. But not tonight. \n\nJames went to bed, having a tough time with the slowly growing headache. In the morning he opted to skip breakfast for another 10 minutes at the computer. He started the game up to see that the people were still sleeping, when an odd command appeared under his cursor. James couldn't resist clicking it, and just as commanded the wife disappeared under the covers, and the husband quickly awoke. \"Lucky him,\" James murmured to himself. \n\nThat morning he followed the girl, and with his new plan and improved skill, decided to make her more... outgoing. He watched her go to work, which he found incredibly boring. An accounting firm. Again, he was stunned how this game was given to him for a kid. Then he decided to take control. \"A strip club!\" he thought. She left work and drove directly to a strip club, walked in and, by his command, got on stage. Dollars flew at her from the 10 or so patrons, and with each green spec the on-screen cash number increased. \n\nThen the husband called her. Yelling so loud that James had to turn down the volume. He grew angry. The reminder of what he was going through was not a welcome sight. He promptly dropped the phone, then smashed it with her shoe. Then, without hesitation she grabbed the closest patron and dragged him to the bathroom. \n\nAs night rolled around, and the tiredness meter depleated, his day of nefarious behavior was over. As her car rolled into the driveway the husband ran out of the house. Screaming. Ten minutes of fighting in the driveway ensued, as much as James commanded them to stop. Then, they moved into the house and the screaming grew even louder. \n\nThen she hit him. She walked out the door and drove off in the car. James threw the keyboard across the room. \n\nHe had already made it 4 days, but every second seemed like an eternity and he gave into the stress. All he could scrape together was not nearly as much as he wanted, but he was far from sober. Then he went back to the computer.\n\nRage. Rage was all he felt as he watched the wife come back into the house to find the husband sleeping on the couch. James commanded her to sleep, and took control of the man. He pulled a jerry can from the garage, the had him spill gallons of gas across the first floor. He ordered the man to stay in the house. \n\nHe was done.\n\nThe next morning James had woken up with his head against the monitor. \"Fuck,\" he said aloud feeling the hangover. He walked to the chair where he used to spend almost every free moment and turned on the TV. Nothing good on at 8 in the morning except the news. His hear stopped as he switched to his local news channel. Paralyzed, totally unable to move, to breathe, to think, he blinked. It was still there.\n\nThe screen read: Husband takes life in murder suicide arson in Aullville. \nThree familiar faces were presented below."]], [[{"comment": "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n", "id": "daqhbi1"}], [{"comment": "I slid my 'new' copy of Sims 5 into external CD reader and begin the installation. \n\nOh man, the memories of this game. Seducing Mrs. S, collapsing her family, leaving her for Mr. S, then leaving him for the new girl, Jane, up the street. Planting insane gardens that took up the entire plot of land, having a kid and locking him in the house as child services try to find a way in, and then burning the whole house down to bring a tragic end to it all. Ah... memories. \n\nThe installation went smoothly and I began to create my first family. I wanted to start as a fresh new bachelor and work my way up to the big leagues. \n\nWho would I seduce first? My fingers tingled with excitement.\n\nAfter the screen loaded, though, I wasn't alone in the house. In fact, my character wasn't who I created. There was an entire family, a man, women and child. I assumed the game made an error and restarted, but again, the same thing. \n\nI was disappointed, to say the least. I told myself this could still be fun, and if I wanted, I could just have the child taken away and divorce the wife and everything would be okay. Honestly, the game looked a lot more realistic than I remembered before, I was almost certain the kid was about 2 years old and the parents were in their early 30's. \n\nThings began like normal. Dad went to work, mom took care of the kid and I barely had any money to keep their happiness and fun up. I made the dad read more, gave him a gym and a chess board. He was going to work his way up the military ladder; I remembered the pay was excellent. \n\nThen one of the AI's started showing up. Only when the mom was out. She would come over and play with the little boy and then one day, she and the dad kissed. They went into the bedroom, kissed and went to the bed to have sex. I couldn't believe it, I didn't even tell him to do it! This AI was amazing! It would kickstart my whole plan to make him a bachelor again.\n\nThings continued like this for awhile: the dad went to work, improved his stats, received promotions, slept with the random girl when the mom was out and I had enough money to really improve the house. I was ready to blow this whole thing up and today it was perfect. \n\nThe mom was still in the house, the adulteress was walking down the sidewalk and the dad was working out. The adulteress went around the back of the house and waited. She wasn't going to hide that easily. I told the mom to go out and start BBQing and the dad to go kiss his femme fatale. \n\nThey didn't... I slammed my fist against my desk. What the hell was wrong with this game? The mom left the house and the lady came in, then the dad kissed her. Not what I wanted! They walked to the bedroom again, and I knew they would start having sex. They did, but then the kid walked in. \n\nMy blood ran cold. I noticed above the headboard there was a painting in the game of a loon gliding across a smooth lake's water. The same painting at my mother's house... The adulteress had something familiar about her too. The jet black hair. \n\nThen it happened. I remembered. \n\nWhen I was a kid I walked in, trying to find mom. When I opened the door and asked, this lady was on top of my dad... I fast forwarded the timer.\n\nThe same routine continued, until a month later when, I guess it was my mom, had found out and was yelling at my dad. They screamed and my dad threw a plate against the wall before storming out of the house. I watched my mom crawl up beside the broken pieces and cry. I watched the AI do what I knew was going to happen.\n\nI remembered, clear as day, walking up to her that day. I sat down beside her as she cried. Whenever I cried she gave me my teddy bear, Mr. Cuddles and that day I gave him to her. \n\nAs I watched the animation of me lean up beside her, the game slowly fizzled out and a \u201cgame over\u201d screen appeared. Feelings of regret and reminiscence took me. It had been awhile since I last talked to my mother. Things were busy lately (as busy as they can be when you decide to play a video game instead of calling your mother) and I knew my father was a scumbag, but she never told me what happened. I figured he just left\u2014he was always flakey anyway. But in all those years of raising me, I never knew the full sadness she carried. So I picked up the phone and dialed her number.\n\n\u201cJeffery! What a treat to hear from you! What have you been up to?\u201d she answered.\n\n\u201cWell first off, I just wanted you to know I love and miss you, but other than that, nothing,\u201d I joked. She laughed and we talked for the next hour. It was simple, but I think it made today a little more cheerful for the both of us.   \n\n\nEdit: Added to the ending. \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nMore stories at /r/ItsPronouncedGif.

Though Sims 4 had been good, it had never been *quite* realistic enough for him. \n\nWhen he got home and popped in the CD, he began jotting out his plans for his first family. He couldn\u2019t wait to get started. He built the house carefully: a pool surrounding them, a nice, roomy basement. A family of eight, six of them children. \n\nAt first, it was the same as usual. His sims' needs plummeted as he deprived them of food and sleep. It was fun, but not exactly anything new. \n\nIt was only when they started working together on their own, to escape the basement, that he begun to wonder. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. One of the drawbacks of the game - they were just stupid, simulated people, doing exactly what he told them. Not like real people. *Real* people would act like this, would try to escape. \n\nHis hands trembled with excitement as he tried to direct them. Some - like the smallest children - obeyed, while others appeared to be screaming directly at him. One of the parents refused to attack his own children like he\u2019d ordered, instead breaking down in tears on the floor. \n\nThere could only be one explanation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all real, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re real,\u201d he whispered, leaning back from the computer as he considered the implications of this.\n\nIf they were real, did that mean he was God? He\u2019d always suspected, but this was surely a sign\u2026a signal. He turned his eyes on the sims again. Feverishly, lost in the dark world he had been afraid to imagine up to this point, he began to play in earnest.\n\n-----------\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got something, sir,\u201d agent Katherine Masters said, showing her supervisor the live feed of one of the webcams.\n\nA pale-faced young man\u2019s eyes were lit with joy as he tortured a family of eight.\n\n\u201cGood job, Katherine,\u201d agent Daniel Simmons murmured, hastening over to check the feed for himself.\n\nAs always, he felt slightly nauseous as he watched the man\u2019s enraptured expression. \n\nRight from the start, the Sadism Identification Mechanism operation had been a massive pain in the ass to get approved and implemented. First there was the game\u2019s development. It had been a long, tedious slog, to get the coding perfect - to make the sims behave as unpredictably as possible.\n\nThen the marketing - its number of sales were crucial to their operation\u2019s success. And above all, getting approval to hack into the players\u2019 webcams. It would be a disaster if details of the operation became public, even though they abandoned most of the feeds after a week. Watching someone direct their sims to go to work and make pancakes was hardly a good use of their resources.\n\nBut then there were others. \n\nThe ones who made the red tape and headaches worth it. The ones who proved that the game could be a revolutionary tool to catch some perpetrators early. Those who would likely move on from torturing highly realistic, simulated people - to real people.\n\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got the address?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cAll his details,\u201d Katherine confirmed.\n\n\u201cKeep watching him,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cWe need more.\"\n\nKatherine started to reply, when they heard Ethan whisper something in a fervent tone, like he was praying. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re all real, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re real,\u201d he said. Instead of seeming uneasy, the boy looked ecstatic.\n\n\u201cDelusions,\u201d Daniel noted. \u201cInteresting. Focus only on him for now, Katherine.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, stifling a sigh. It was draining work, looking into these people\u2019s eyes when they thought no-one was watching. It had already been a pain with the previous games. But somehow, the things she saw only got worse as the games got more realistic. People got increasingly carried away as they dreamt they could control actual people.\n\n\"Yesss! I'm God!\" Ethan was whispering to himself as he drowned two of his sims in the pool, while another was consumed by flames in the kitchen.\n\nKatherine made a note of that, shaking her head as she took a sip of coffee. The number of people who immediately jumped to *that* conclusion was rather disturbing.\n\n--------\nHope you enjoyed my story!

And I was a prime volunteer. \n\nThe combination of street performers, open drinking laws, magical Mardi Gras beads, and bourbon street almost guaranteed a blackout whenever I took a vacation there- and if they didn't, they the buddies I brought along with me would help push me over the edge. Hell, the last time we went I remember boarding the plane to get there, and I remember getting on the plane to leave. But absolutely nothing in between. \n\nWhich was why I was surprised unpacking my bags by a small case tossed into a side pocket, with a disk inside. And stapled to the front, almost in a gruesome manner, was a receipt from *Vick's VooDoo*, made out by scrawling handwriting, with a row of symbols along the bottom. \n\nI'd stayed home from work that day, the hangover from the trip still pounding in my head, my stomach releasing smells long since declared illegal by the Geneva convention. And with nothing better to do, I popped the game in my computer, and I began to play. \n\nI'd never played the Sims, but I'd seen it done, and I knew how it worked. It would be best to start with something easy, a family I could model without much trouble.\n\nSo I settled on the neighbors, Jim and Martha. Late thirties, boring people actually- for the past six weeks, Jim had been trying to put together an apartment complex wide barnecue for the forth of July, and I was certain he would consider it one of his top achievements. Maybe even make a spot of his resume. \n\nSo in the game, I had him buy a grill and party supplies, easily outstripping their measly budget. And as I yawned, and prepared for bed, I found him a new job so his barbecue could have additional funding, and not be as lame as real life. Two times his current income- still nothing amazing, but for a man like Jim, he had struck gold. \n\nAnd walking to my car the next morning, Jim bumped into me at the bottom of the stairs as we excited the building, and walked over to a car parked in between two spaces, straddling the white line to provide more space. \n\n\"You're looking!,\" he said proudly, slapping the hood, \"Of a proud owner of a new Honda Civic! Drives like a champ, and let me tell you that those Chinese Engineers really know how to drive up those MPG's!\"\n\nHe grinned, and waited for my acknowledgment, his eyes searching. Only Jim would need his neighbor's approval for buying a new car, especially a civic. \n\n\"Cool stuff, Jim\", I answered as I stepped into my own car, \"how'd you swing that?\"\n\n\"New job at the plant!\" He shouted back, \"And whewee, did it come with extra green!\"\n\n\"Congrats,\" I muttered, and started to close the door, cutting off his words. \n\n\"And don't forget this next weekend is the barbecue- I bought a new grill and-\"\n\nBut the door was shut, and I was already on my morning grind. And it wasn't until the second stoplight that the realization hit me. The thought pulled at me all day at work until I clocked out that day, and I fired up The Sims. And I put my theory to the test. \n\nThe walls between out apartment were thin- so thin, I could often hear snippets of speech. And I experimented. \n\nI clicked *argue*, and Jim's voice would float over about how his wife should make potato salad instead of mashed potatoes for the barbecue, and he *did not give s damn* whether she had won blue ribbon ten years before at the fair for her Tater Tornado. \n\nThen I could make them high five in the heat of it, the stands coming through the drywall. \n\nAnd I heard the make up sex I commanded, probably their first in years, the sounds cringeworthy as I decided never to select that option again. But I smiled, looking at the receipt from Vick's Voodoo on the ground, and reading the text for the first time. \n\n\"*You may not remember me, but I'll remember you, Mr. Tim. Take this, as a parting gift. A way of giving you what you have earned.*\n\nAnd on the computer, I selected *New Game*, buying my lip in thought of who I should choose next. Names flitted through my head as my fingers itched at the keys- Zuckerburg or Gates who could leave me gifts, a few of my exes for what they deserved, GRR Martin who I could confine to his study until he actually wrote a damn book, The Cubs Team so they could finally win the World Series- the list went on for nearly ten minutes. Then I typed a name, and hit enter, adrenaline rushing as the screen began to load. \n\nBut not before cancelling Jim's barbecue. \n\n*** \n\nBy Leo\n\n", "id": "daqlaa3"}, {"comment": "I need more.", "id": "dar0l0o"}, {"comment": "Wait... didn't the cubs win the world series already?", "id": "dar1qo4"}, {"comment": "And so we know the next option he picked.

I'd been waiting for this for *years,* Father always thought I was too young for games and control like this, but for my birthday He finally gave in and bought me the game.  \n\nI put in the disc and the game loaded and prompted me to choose my character. I couldn't customize him though, only put in preferences. Fine. I would start with a family, one man one woman and two young children, your average family. \n\nThe screen showed the globe spinning and then stopped and zoomed into a family in some suburb in America I think it's called. Father always chastised me for not knowing geography, said it was important to know these things but it just didn't settle in, so many names, so many divisions. \n\nAnyways, I was looking down at a house from the top, the family was having dinner together. They were talking and joking and laughing. It was wonderful. I didn't even do anything then, just listened to them talk, joke. Father and I had fun yes, but I had no one else, all the people who worked for Father were really serious and not very fun. I wondered what it would be like to have my own brother or sister. \n\nAll the time I marveled at the care that must have gone into making a game like this, it all seemed so *real.* Once everyone went to bed I fast forwarded to the morning, still not doing anything. The kids went to the bus and off to learn, and the father kissed his wife and went to work. The mother stayed home and I watched her cooking and cleaning...normal things. But then there was knock on the door. \n\nThe mother went to open it and a man came in. It wasn't the father. They kissed and went to the bedroom. I knew what that meant, Father never told me, but I found out, overheard things. I was angry. Why would she do this? She has such a happy family! I tried to tell her to stop, told the guy to go away...it didn't work. Was this game broken?\n\nResolved, I went to the father to tell him to come home. I shifted the screen to the office to find him driving back already, he looked really angry. He must've found out without me! I watched as the father drove homewards, so angry. I knew it was a game, but again, it felt really real. \n\nI saw what was about to happen a moment before it did. He wasn't going to stop at the light. I knew about traffic lights see, I was really interested in human electronics. I knew he had to stop, that it was dangerous not to. I tried to control him, but again, the character didn't obey, and he drove past the light...into a truck.\n\nDead on impact.\n\nNo...no. Why was this happening? I closed the computer angrily, I didn't want to see the kids come home, find out what had happened, find out what the mother would go through. \n\nI went to Father.\n\nHe was sitting at his chair as usual, looking at the globe. But he looked up when I came in in tears. \n\n\"You tricked me!\" I accused. He always did this, put me through tests, to make me ready he said. To take over his job. \n\nHe smiled at me, he always smiled, and I hated it. Because whenever he smiled my anger melted away. \"I'm sorry, son,\" he said in a booming voice, \"but I had to...you have to learn.\" \n\n\"Learn what?\" I protested, \"learn to watch tragedy, to watch the worst in people?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Father said, \"but a bit more.\"\n\nI started to say something but Father held up a hand. \"You must learn to give free will. It is not our job to interfere, to make everything better, our job is to give choice, to let the normal flow of things happen. You must learn not to take away free will whatever the consequences. It is the only rule we have.\"\n\n\"But what if it makes them sad?\" I protested. \n\nFather smiled again, \"In the end, son, when they come to us, they'll all be happy.\"\n\n***\n(Author's note: if you didn't get it (or simply because it wasn't clear), the Father (denoted by the capital letter) is supposed to be a God of some sort, with the son one day to replace him.)\n\nIf you enjoyed, check out my new subreddit [XcessiveWriting](https://www.reddit.com/r/XcessiveWriting/)\n    ", "id": "daqlaan"}, {"comment": "I really liked this.

I'd been playing Sims 5 everyday now for the past three years. At first, when I saw it there in the used PC games section I thought it was a joke. I couldn't find any mention of it on Steam, there wasn't hundreds of dollars of DLC discs that I knew of, just a used game that apparently didn't exist. On sale for a dollar.\n\nI bought it on a whim. It was just a dollar, what did I have to lose? It was probably a copy of the original Sims just re-wrapped to trick people. Probably someone hoping I'd post a picture of it on reddit asking \"Who did this?\"\n\nI destroyed four families before I realized it wasn't a game.\n\nWhen I booted it up, the graphics were next-gen. Better than next gen, actually, which surprised me since my PC couldn't run Sims 3 without occasional lag. There was no longer a create-a-sim option, just a selection list, a search function or a \"Select Random Family\" button. And there weren't any made up towns anymore, the game was *global*. I could select families in China, the U.S, Australia... I thought they were just going for that \"progressive diversity\" thing they started with the whole gender update in Sims 4 and thought nothing of it. The only difference was a coloured difficulty rating for each family. Families in China had a difficulty ranging from Green to Orange depending on where they were, American first world families rarely dropped below Yellow difficulty while third world families rarely got better than an Orange rating.\n\nI shrugged and went with easy. I chose a family from my home town just for giggles. They tanked right away. I accessed the cheat console to find out if 'Motherlode' still worked, which it did, and proceeded to try to deck out the house. By the next day police appeared and arrested the father on suspicion of tax fraud. It confused me at first but I figured it was some sort of cheat detection thing. The next family went a little smoother. Apparently there was the option to access bank accounts and direct money into offshore accounts that prevented my Sims from being arrested, so I took full advantage of it.\n\nThis was a family had no kids, so I quickly started trying to max their stats I quit their jobs and made the wife run non-stop on the treadmill to build cardio, accessing the debug menu to keep her mood maxed. I had the husband sit in front of his laptop and write novels all day, hoping to max out the revenue so I'd rely less on Motherlode for money.\n\nThe were dead in three days. A notification told me it was dehydration.\n\nThat was when the game started to annoy me. Why would they limit cheating? It made no sense! I tested another two families before giving up for the evening. Too much was different. Building extensions to homes required builders, which too time even if you sped the game to it's highest in-game speed so I demolished the whole house out of spite and found another family. I decided to test what would get me killed with that one. It was a wife, husband and a teenage son & daughter.\n\nI placed the son in his room, deleted the windows and doors and maxed the mood. Dead from dehydration in three days. I did the same to the daughter, but this time I didn't max out moods. It was the usual. Stamping, screaming, wetting themselves, but it got too real and intense. Now they wouldn't just wet themselves, there was defecation. There was pounding and screaming on the walls *seriously* debuffed the mood of the parents. I ended up maxing the moods just so she'd die a little quieter.\n\nThe weirdest part at the time was that the bodies wouldn't disappear and turn into urns. Apparently there was a whole body disposal system now. I tried to build a door to the rooms, but a warning appeared.\n\n*Warning: Calling in other Sims while the bodies of Sims that have died due to negligence are present may result in arrest. Do you want to call in other Sims or would you like your Sims to attempt to complete this task. Skill training in repair affects success.*\n\nI shrugged. It made sense, so I made the parents demolish the wall and removed static moods to see what the effect would be. The moment they found the son they both plummeted in mood. The mother wouldn't stop crying over the body and the father ignored all commands and started knocking down the wall to the daughters room. When he found her body the screen flashed.\n\n*One of your Sims is suffering a mental break: Homicidal Rage.*\n\nI laughed at that. Apparently EA was ripping off RimWorld now. I watched the father calmly walk over to a liquor cabinet, take a drink and then unlock a gun safe I didn't even realize was there. He then went over to his wife and shot her pointblank in the back of the head.\n\nI stopped giggling.\n\nHe then went to his laptop, wrote for a moment, and then shot himself. I shut off the game. That was just taking things too far. This obviously had to be some fan game, there was no way EA would include something like that. I shook it off, had a beer to take the bad taste out of my mouth and went to bed.\n\nIt was at work the next day that I got the news. A family that had apparently locked their children away, letting them die of dehydration. The cops had been alerted to gunfire the previous evening finding that the husband had killed himself and his wife in an apparent murder-suicide. My hometown was in shock. Me? I was in a daze. I started googling the names of the previous Sims I had played. One was arrested two days earlier on suspicions of tax fraud, another couple was found dead under mysterious circumstances. One was suing a construction company for completely demolishing their home.\n\nIt was like I'd found the Death Note. I was dumbfounded. Was I a murderer? Had I killed those people? The reports said this had happened several days ago, so how could that be? And the bodies...\n\nI stopped.\n\nThe Grim Reaper had collected their souls just like the other games. That couldn't have been real, could it? I excused myself from work and went home, claiming illness, and just cried. I cried for hours. I couldn't decide whether to tell anyone or not. Who would believe me? Eventually tears gave way to laughter. I had to be imagining things, didn't I? There was no way that I could have so much...\n\nPower. I had *power*.\n\nSuddenly I needed to know more.\n\n------------------------------\n\n**To Be Continued.**", "id": "dar8p3f"}, {"comment": "**Part 2.**\n\nI started cautiously. In all honesty I was afraid that I was going to get caught, but I never was. I started typing famous names into the SimSearch. Some worked while others didn't. I found that I couldn't control world leaders or influential politicians, but I could manipulate celebrities. I also, understandingly, couldn't control myself.\n\nI ran at least two celebs into the dirt before breakfast.\n\nI found my neighbors and old high school crash. I just watched them, spying on them instead of controlling them. I was the ultimate pepping tom. Several times I had to correct myself. I wasn't watching scripted AI, I was watching *actual* intelligence!\n\nI started looking up Sims cheats and experimenting. The game seemed to screw with time. Any action I made in the game was always in the past and whenever I exited it would always realign with the present.\n\nI knew the power was corrupting me, I just didn't care. I found one of my coworkers, the cute raven-haired girl with the freckles. I watched her at work and at home. I watched my \"past\" SimSelf try to make small talk and I watched what she really thought of me when we'd chat. I didn't even rate as an acquaintance to her. I debugged her mood and set her affection rating towards me to 100. \n\nShe was naked in my bed the next morning.\n\nI started to toy with the idea of controlling my boss and manipulating him into giving me a raise, but then it hit me; I didn't need to work any more. My Sims could do it for me.\n\nI started narrowing my searches. I'd find Sims and ramp up their creativity skill, I'd max them out at work and get them promotions. I made the set up a joint bank account that I could access whenever I needed. They'd buy me furniture and never know why. They'd never even stop to think about it because I wouldn't let them.\n\nEventually I tried to exert as much influence with the simplest action possible. I wanted to see if I could raise the popularity of artists I liked, to get actors I enjoyed into the roles I wanted to see them in. I started by giving certain musicians cancer before becoming more and more subtle. I'd cause heart attacks in the debug menu, bring their mood down just a little each day until they killed themselves, made them mix medications without thinking.\n\nI would have done something similar to Castro if the game would have let me control him.\n\nFor others, I prevented their deaths. If I was waiting on a new book in a series, I'd remove negative health traits where I could. They'd return over time, so I needed to remain vigilant, but my greed for what I wanted was all the motivation I needed. I still remember the one time I forgot to check in on one musician. Dead just after his birthday. I hated myself for that one.\n\nSuddenly the world became one big joke to me. I was almost certainly a killer. Had I just stopped the moment I learned of the game's potential then I would have been fine, but I didn't. I took life knowing that it had real-world consequence. I took women to my bed knowing full well that by exerting my control over them I was removing all pretense of consent.\n\nI was a monster. But I was a monster with power.\n\nI found loopholes when it came to controlling Sims. I could control them until they reached a certain point of political influence, so I selected a billionaire and maxed his charisma. I wanted to see how far I could push things. It wasn't until the actual presidential election that the game revoked control.\n\nRecently however, I've found myself getting bored. There's no more challenge. No more struggle and no more difficulty. What I want, I get. But no one knows it was me. Nothing is genuine and I have the nagging suspicion that my antics have harmed the world more than they've helped it, so tonight I'm trying something new.\n\nI've gone deep into the SimSearch this time. I've found an infertile woman, single and recently in her twenties. A virgin from a poor background. She doesn't know it yet, but she's pregnant. If I did this right, it's going to be twins, a boy and a girl. I've found some traits that I've been testing that I'm going to assign them once their born. After that, I think I'll just watch them. I don't think I'm the kind of person that should control certain people.\n\nThat doesn't mean I'll stop, oh no. I'll keep controlling other Sims, influencing them and essentially whispering in their ears. But those two? They'll be new. A challenge, like the yin to my yang.\n\nI'm curious to see if they'll be able to do more good than I can do harm. It should be fun.", "id": "darfyk7"}, {"comment": "I like that trump reference.

The instructions were so accurate I could almost gone out to the street and perform the killing without a gun, because I could tell exactly how the body would behave. My reward rendered all codes obsolete, but I was no longer surprised. The Sims 5 was almost too good to be true. Almost boring. I was the spitting image of the picture created by fiction writers. Went to the same places. Killed the same people. I started to notice a pattern, because I could no longer choose wether to accept the jobs or which weapon to use. It was like an AI with a mind of its own. It was still fun. Only predictable. *What do you want to do next?* I smiled. I wanted to chase the good guys.

He checked his watch, 3:20. \"They should be back,\" he said as he marched through the door.

He remembered feeling weird when she used the word. \"You dont built a family.\"\n\nThen, with no warning, the game started. Voices faintly spoke from the machine as images of people walked around a 3 story house. \"If only it was that easy.\" He explored the game, doing the things his daughter had showed him. Making the family cook, clean, work. Motonous daily activities. He hated it. \n\nJames left for the TV. Less thought. He figured that getting through the day was all that was important, and without thinking he could get through the day. But after an eternity of stupid shows, sports, and news he checked the clock. 10:30. \"Fuck,\" he whispered to himself. James had began to realize how often he had said that. \n\nSo he went back to the computer. The game was still running, and he saw the computer person doing something perculiur; it was taking a smoke break. A game for kids, and it was smoking. But James had another idea, he could use this character to do all the things that he had never done.\n\nFirst was smoking. He was still baffled that this \"thing\" would smoke in a kids game. Next was... nothing. He watched this thing sitting at a desk for almost ten minutes before he could even think of something to make it do. \"A casino,\" he thought. He had never gambeled with anything other than scratch-offs.\n\n He had the thing leave the building and drive to the casino. Hours of loosing before James had realized that there was no point to a virtual casino. There is nothing to win. Nothing real he can loose. So he decided to leave. Both the game and James' world were dark. As the thing walked out, he was propositioned. \"Ten buck for a joint,\" the shady looking man said audibly through the game. Dumbfounded, James decided to take it. Smoking pot was another thing he had never done. The game became odd. Oddly accurate. The man's driving was significantly worse, and speaking to his wife was slower and more incoherent than anything said before. \n\n\"A fucking kids game\" he shouted. Then anxiety washed over him when he remembered why he had bought the game in the first place. He wanted a drink. But that was what got him here in the first place. \n\nThen he got back to the game. Realizing that he could controll the entire family, Husband, wife, and son, he switched to the wife. She was cooking dinner when the husband came home. She had stopped to yell at the husband for smoking, and the pot on the stove began to boil over. \"Go and fix it,\" he commanded. But then another thought. Why did he make her do that. There are no repercussion, nothing of value can be lost. The game was like the casino. So he decided to go a different route with his playing. Not things he would want to do, but rather things he would never do. But not tonight. \n\nJames went to bed, having a tough time with the slowly growing headache. In the morning he opted to skip breakfast for another 10 minutes at the computer. He started the game up to see that the people were still sleeping, when an odd command appeared under his cursor. James couldn't resist clicking it, and just as commanded the wife disappeared under the covers, and the husband quickly awoke. \"Lucky him,\" James murmured to himself. \n\nThat morning he followed the girl, and with his new plan and improved skill, decided to make her more... outgoing. He watched her go to work, which he found incredibly boring. An accounting firm. Again, he was stunned how this game was given to him for a kid. Then he decided to take control. \"A strip club!\" he thought. She left work and drove directly to a strip club, walked in and, by his command, got on stage. Dollars flew at her from the 10 or so patrons, and with each green spec the on-screen cash number increased. \n\nThen the husband called her. Yelling so loud that James had to turn down the volume. He grew angry. The reminder of what he was going through was not a welcome sight. He promptly dropped the phone, then smashed it with her shoe. Then, without hesitation she grabbed the closest patron and dragged him to the bathroom. \n\nAs night rolled around, and the tiredness meter depleated, his day of nefarious behavior was over. As her car rolled into the driveway the husband ran out of the house. Screaming. Ten minutes of fighting in the driveway ensued, as much as James commanded them to stop. Then, they moved into the house and the screaming grew even louder. \n\nThen she hit him. She walked out the door and drove off in the car. James threw the keyboard across the room. \n\nHe had already made it 4 days, but every second seemed like an eternity and he gave into the stress. All he could scrape together was not nearly as much as he wanted, but he was far from sober. Then he went back to the computer.\n\nRage. Rage was all he felt as he watched the wife come back into the house to find the husband sleeping on the couch. James commanded her to sleep, and took control of the man. He pulled a jerry can from the garage, the had him spill gallons of gas across the first floor. He ordered the man to stay in the house. \n\nHe was done.\n\nThe next morning James had woken up with his head against the monitor. \"Fuck,\" he said aloud feeling the hangover. He walked to the chair where he used to spend almost every free moment and turned on the TV. Nothing good on at 8 in the morning except the news. His hear stopped as he switched to his local news channel. Paralyzed, totally unable to move, to breathe, to think, he blinked. It was still there.\n\nThe screen read: Husband takes life in murder suicide arson in Aullville. \nThree familiar faces were presented below.", "id": "darn6cm"}]]], "5gdvfo": ["[EU] Somehow Jigsaw has managed to capture The Joker, but who is really being tested?", "2016-12-04 07:56:50", 1, "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5gdvfo/eu_somehow_jigsaw_has_managed_to_capture_the/", [[1, "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n"]], [[{"comment": "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n", "id": "dargsrq"}]]], "5gcd8y": ["[WP] For some reason, when you woke up this morning you could only understand German and speak Chinese.", "2016-12-04 02:11:59", 1, "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5gcd8y/wp_for_some_reason_when_you_woke_up_this_morning/", [], []], "5gd92t": ["[WP] You're the greatest detective in the world, as well as the most gullible.

He dragged his bare feet through the white sand, letting the grains fall through his toes. He looked out at the sea. The water was calm. There were clouds rolling across the sky like the waves in the water. \n\nSuddenly, a glint of light caught his eye. Tucked in a pocket of sand being washed over by the waves, was a perfectly intact conch shell. The man, overwhelmed by curiosity, picked it up. It was a beautiful specimen. Its spikes circled the golden exterior, forming a regal crown. The smooth interior was a fleshy-pink color that grew brighter as it wound inward to its mysterious center. \n\nThe man smiled to himself. When he was a boy he and his brother used to troll the beach looking for shells as perfect as this one. They would collect as many as they could find and, once back home, they would listen to the sounds inside, longing to see the ocean once more. The man put this shell to his ear, eager to hear the nostalgic noise once more. \n\nHe heard only screams. \n\nHe looked around him, wondering where the cries were coming from. He saw and heard no one. He lifted the shell go his ear once more and was greeted by the same disconcerting shrieks. \n\n\"Someone. Help me please!\" came a voice through the chaos.

People just started dying. It started with the most famous people. I'm old enough to remember that everyone thought 2016 was just a bad year for celebrity deaths, but they had no idea what was happening. \n\nI still don't get how it works, but I trust science, y'know?\n\nAfter a few years, there were almost no famous people left. Some dedicated actors would try and make it, only to drop like lead flies after a big role. It was clear what I needed to do.\n\nFirst, I got an apartment in the suburbs. Nothing really interesting ever happens in suburbs, and even the cool things inspired by the humdrum white picket fences had to move back to the city to be fully realized. \n\nThen, I got a TV. Not one too big, or too small, or too new, just a TV. I only watch reruns of old reality TV shows. Next was a trip to the grocery store. That was easy: bread and water, and one lemon to stave off scurvy. I didn't want to go crazy by myself, so I did get an internet connection, though I only check out Pinterest. \n\nI lived like this for some time. My new lifestyle was essentially free, and I have some family money that would last my multiple life times. Days blurred to months, months to years, and I found myself alone, old, and as far as I could tell, completely forgotten. \n\nThe population had dropped pretty drastically over the decades. Likewise, life expectancy dipped to a person's late 20s. One of the most shocking things for me personally was that society didn't crumble all together.\n\n All news was written anonymously, or under a pseudonym. TV news still exists, but presented had their faces blurred and voices distorted. If I had to guess, it's been at least 90 years since this all started. If I had to guess my own age, I'd say I'm atleast 110.\n\nI had begun to let myself slip a little. I used to internet way more, but I was careful to remain anonymous. I was signing up for some newsletter, and like so many of these things do, they asked for my age. I decided it'd be funny to put my actual age. Nothing happened. I got my newsletter, and everything was grand. For a few days. \n\nI woke up and I was making tea (I decided my diet could become more interesting since anyone who ever knew me was long dead), when I almost jumped out of skin at a horrible and unfamiliar noise. It was only a knock on the door, but it took me much longer than I care to admit to figure that out. \n\nI opened to door to young man. It was a the first face I had seen since the 20's, and it wasn't the nicest way to be reintroduced. He looked disgusted and shocked. Obviously, he had never seen anyone much older than himself. \n\nHe asked my name, and I reluctantly told him. He then spoke for awhile about my IP address being monitored after an anomaly. After some more digging, he explained, they realized my apartment hadn't changed hands in nearly a century. Curiosity got the better of him, so he came to investigate himself. \n\nI began to feel ill. I knew what this was instantly. I asked him to leave, and to please not mention my whereabouts, or name, or anything else to anyone. Asked is polite - I begged him to forget about me. He assured me he would, and then left. \n\nI had forgotten what fear felt like. In those early days I was so afraid. But I hadn't had to think about fear in decades. I barely slept while my worried sweat dampened my sheats. \n\nThe next morning I awoke earlier than usual. Sleep was neither peaceful nor rejuvenation. I had a horrible headache though. This caused more concern. \n\nI flipped on the TV to a blurry face and deep voice reading the news. The news today was my name and picture. Then I realized my headache wouldn't go away. \n\nAs quickly as my old bones could move me, I went to liquor cabinet. I had always worried that liquor would cause a craving for human interaction, but now I just needed it to get through.\n\nAfter a long, deep pull from the bottle, I sat where I had spent most of life. I wish I could say my life flashed before my eyes, but I wouldn't have even been able to tell if my life was flashing before me because my view from this spot had been fixed for so long all my memories looked the same.   \n\nWhile I write this, I'm already fading. An old person today is quite the oddity indeed.  Fading quickly now. From the colour of my apartment, slowly to black. \n\nBlack now. Slowly to grey. \n\nGoodbye.         "], [1, "It's not something that I am able to turn on and off, nor is it something that I can attempt half-heartily. No this is something that I have to do from the moment that I wake up, to the moment that I fall asleep. Last time I let my guard down my neighbor saw me through the window yelling \"Fus Ru Dah\" at my television, Had to start a fire to get my neighbor to shut up about it. I aged about seven years that Thanksgiving. So now every morning was the same routine: I wake up, make my bed, shit, shower, shave, get dressed, and head to work. I try to stick to bland colors like my favorite khaki pants, that I have four pairs of, and a white dress top. I stop by my favorite coffee shop on my way to work, I selected Coffee-Rama for their high level of customers, easy to be just another face in the crowd there. I order my a small coffee, nothing to special, slowly turn to the right, and take five steps over to the pick-up counter. Denise is pouring my coffee again, or like Lee and Real like to say, DeNice. That always made me smil... \"Small coffe... Oh hey Mr. Aye, Nice to finally see you smiling.\" Did she just say my name? I notice Denise take a step back as my eyes begin to widen. \"Is everything okay Mr. Aye?\" No this can't be happening. I turn around and begin to make my way to the exit, when I bump into some older woman, causing her to drop her coffee onto her grandson's head. I'm break out into a sprint as he begins to yell in agony with what I can assume are second degree burns. The last thing I see are the eyes of everyone staring at me as I exit Coffee-Rama"], [1, "I checked my gray pocket watch, my life clock, to check my new time. 5:12, which meant I had fifty-two years left. You see, the 60 minute hour is divided by six, which leaves ten. The hour hand indicates the tens place while the minute hand indicates the ones. Every six minutes counts as one year. Understand? Good.\n\nYou see, about eleven years ago, back when I was twelve, I threw a broken stopwatch at our bitter old neighbor, Ms. Kumquat. Well, it turns out she was a witch. A witch with no sense of humor, really. Anyway, angered by my childish behavior, she cast a hex on me. How did that hex go again? Something like the name of that one movie. You know, that one movie? The one with the actor? I think his name was James or something. Anywho, the hex shortens my life by a year for every minute someone's thinking about me. And since I was incredibly interesting in my youth, I went down hard. Ah, I remember the good old days, when I would skateboard down Crabapple Peak. I'm sorry, I'm rambling, aren't I?\n\nSo, I resorted to becoming very uninteresting, like a senior. This includes telling stories that don't go anywhere. Did I ever tell you about the time I took the ferry to get a new heel for my shoe? What? I did? Okay, then. I also began wearing gray clothing, the universal color for blandness. Did you know gray is the color between black and white? That was pretty interesting to me.\n\nYou can leave now. I know you're bored out of your mind. That's exactly what I want.

Days blurred to months, months to years, and I found myself alone, old, and as far as I could tell, completely forgotten. \n\nThe population had dropped pretty drastically over the decades. Likewise, life expectancy dipped to a person's late 20s. One of the most shocking things for me personally was that society didn't crumble all together.\n\n All news was written anonymously, or under a pseudonym. TV news still exists, but presented had their faces blurred and voices distorted. If I had to guess, it's been at least 90 years since this all started. If I had to guess my own age, I'd say I'm atleast 110.\n\nI had begun to let myself slip a little. I used to internet way more, but I was careful to remain anonymous. I was signing up for some newsletter, and like so many of these things do, they asked for my age. I decided it'd be funny to put my actual age. Nothing happened. I got my newsletter, and everything was grand. For a few days. \n\nI woke up and I was making tea (I decided my diet could become more interesting since anyone who ever knew me was long dead), when I almost jumped out of skin at a horrible and unfamiliar noise. It was only a knock on the door, but it took me much longer than I care to admit to figure that out. \n\nI opened to door to young man. It was a the first face I had seen since the 20's, and it wasn't the nicest way to be reintroduced. He looked disgusted and shocked. Obviously, he had never seen anyone much older than himself. \n\nHe asked my name, and I reluctantly told him. He then spoke for awhile about my IP address being monitored after an anomaly. After some more digging, he explained, they realized my apartment hadn't changed hands in nearly a century. Curiosity got the better of him, so he came to investigate himself. \n\nI began to feel ill. I knew what this was instantly. I asked him to leave, and to please not mention my whereabouts, or name, or anything else to anyone. Asked is polite - I begged him to forget about me. He assured me he would, and then left. \n\nI had forgotten what fear felt like. In those early days I was so afraid. But I hadn't had to think about fear in decades. I barely slept while my worried sweat dampened my sheats. \n\nThe next morning I awoke earlier than usual. Sleep was neither peaceful nor rejuvenation. I had a horrible headache though. This caused more concern. \n\nI flipped on the TV to a blurry face and deep voice reading the news. The news today was my name and picture. Then I realized my headache wouldn't go away. \n\nAs quickly as my old bones could move me, I went to liquor cabinet. I had always worried that liquor would cause a craving for human interaction, but now I just needed it to get through.\n\nAfter a long, deep pull from the bottle, I sat where I had spent most of life. I wish I could say my life flashed before my eyes, but I wouldn't have even been able to tell if my life was flashing before me because my view from this spot had been fixed for so long all my memories looked the same.   \n\nWhile I write this, I'm already fading. An old person today is quite the oddity indeed.  Fading quickly now. From the colour of my apartment, slowly to black. \n\nBlack now. Slowly to grey. \n\nGoodbye.

I aged about seven years that Thanksgiving. So now every morning was the same routine: I wake up, make my bed, shit, shower, shave, get dressed, and head to work. I try to stick to bland colors like my favorite khaki pants, that I have four pairs of, and a white dress top. I stop by my favorite coffee shop on my way to work, I selected Coffee-Rama for their high level of customers, easy to be just another face in the crowd there. I order my a small coffee, nothing to special, slowly turn to the right, and take five steps over to the pick-up counter. Denise is pouring my coffee again, or like Lee and Real like to say, DeNice. That always made me smil... \"Small coffe... Oh hey Mr. Aye, Nice to finally see you smiling.\" Did she just say my name? I notice Denise take a step back as my eyes begin to widen. \"Is everything okay Mr. Aye?\" No this can't be happening. I turn around and begin to make my way to the exit, when I bump into some older woman, causing her to drop her coffee onto her grandson's head.

You see, the 60 minute hour is divided by six, which leaves ten. The hour hand indicates the tens place while the minute hand indicates the ones. Every six minutes counts as one year. Understand? Good.\n\nYou see, about eleven years ago, back when I was twelve, I threw a broken stopwatch at our bitter old neighbor, Ms. Kumquat. Well, it turns out she was a witch. A witch with no sense of humor, really. Anyway, angered by my childish behavior, she cast a hex on me. How did that hex go again? Something like the name of that one movie. You know, that one movie? The one with the actor? I think his name was James or something. Anywho, the hex shortens my life by a year for every minute someone's thinking about me.

I was there from the start. I survived through those hellish years. Ten years on now I tell the tale as true as it was from the moment it began.\n\nIt started like you saw in the movies. A mutation in a influenza virus that killed so quickly patients died within hours of contracting the virus. Governments tried to develop an antibiotic to fight against it but from what I heard it was completely immune to any attempt to eradicate it. My suspicion is that it was one of those super-viruses. Within a year the world's population was reduced by over 90% if my calculations were correct. Of course, what we didn't realize was that once someone infected with the virus died, they didn't stay dead for long. They rose almost as quickly as they died. No resemblance of the person they were before; just raw animalistic instinct. With the virus still spreading around there was no way the overstretched governments could find a counter to this new threat. By the end of the first year we were on our own.\n\nStrangely enough the virus mutated once again and instead of killing quickly within infecting a host, it began to lay dormant within the surviving population. Yet whenever someone died they would always come back after a period of time. It was quicker if one of the re-animated bit you. Dr. Baker, an acquaintance of mine who researched the virus thinks the reason the virus shifted tactics is because of the lack of viable hosts. Better to lay dormant and wait then to destroy your only way of spreading completely. So we had to make peace with the fact that we all carried this horrible disease and would pass it on to our children and our children's children.\n\nThe first few years was just a fight to survive. No one could stay in one place for too long because the massive hordes would be attracted by any gathering of \"living flesh\", and once the hordes started massing towards a place if you didn't get out soon you were as good as dead. We lived like nomads. Trying our best to avoid any groups of the undead but there were always moments of carelessness. My group lost the largest percentage of our numbers in those early years. Many children.\n\nAbout five years in settlements started to come up. There were still hordes out there to worry about but for some reason they weren't as massive or overwhelming as they were in the past. Defensive measures in these settlements were better than in previous attempts. Probably because we had better experience dealing with the undead now. That being said, not every settlement survived. Fall asleep on sentry duty and fail to raise the alarm and next thing you know the walls are busted down and you have hundreds of them swarming in. The ones that survives were the ones that remained vigilant.\n\nSeven years in and there remained very little of the hordes now. What once were groups of thousands of undead coming at us with unstoppable force now dwindled down to bands of maybe fifty or sixty at a time. We couldn't understand what was going on but we were thankful to not have to deal with such overwhelming numbers anymore. Still, our supply runs were still at risk and there were times when we sent out a group and when they hadn't returned by morning we knew they had run into a group. \n\nIt was around this time that Dr. Baker asked permission to study one of them.  He said he wanted to try and determine why so many of them were dying out. It took some time and convincing but eventually our settlement agreed to attempt to capture some for him to study. Our scouting group found a group of thirty one day and slaughtered all but five. We had become very good at taking them out by now and they were only dangerous when you weren't expecting them. \n\nIt took a year of research but when Dr. Baker informed us in year eight the findings of his research we couldn't believe what we were hearing. The undead were decaying at increasingly rapid rates. He told us that while the virus did in fact re-animate the dead in some fashion it did not stop the decomposition process and in fact only delayed it. He theorized that early on when there were massive hordes the virus did not have a means of preventing the bodies it had infected and re-animated from decaying in a matter of weeks and so initially the billions of undead massively dropped to hundreds of millions over the course of the first year. Some time after that it developed a mechanism to stave off decomposition but couldn't stop it completely. And ever since then the population of the undead begun to drop at a steady decline.\n\nThat news made us all very happy. It meant after a while we wouldn't have to worry about those things anymore. We would still have to worry about the living who were still carrying the disease but by now we knew to severe the heads from those who died as soon as they passed away. \n\nIn the final year of the event, we rarely if ever saw an attack by any significant groups of undead. And even when they did they were so fragile they often collapsed before coming anywhere near our walls. Dr. Baker examined a few and indeed there were signs of severe decomposition in all of them. By then our worries shifted towards groups of raiders and other settlements who tried to take what was ours. There was a period of six months or so when we were all at war with each other but eventually we did what everyone at war does and sat down and talked things out. We built up a system of supply and trade and mutual defense. We even set a day for a get together to celebrate another year come and gone. Our crops began to flourish and for the first time in a long time our kids began to forget about those horrific things. \n\nNow as I write this it's been several years since we've encountered even one of those things. Dr. Baker believes by now the initial corpses that had been re-animated have fully decomposed and we are under no threat of attack from those things ever again. We were pushed to the brink of extinction by those things and that damned virus. There's no telling how many of us survived from the billions it eradicated. My settlement isn't very large, only about fifty of us. Largest settlement in the area has around a hundred but most of them are children; newly born in a new world. \n\nI hope our children can read this account of someone who lived through it all. The initial outbreak and mass death. The gargantuan hordes that made it impossible to stay in one place for any significant period of time. The struggle to set up a place and call it \"home'. And the last few years of uncertainty, waiting for things to return to the way they had been.

Commissioner Gordon sighed and looked at Robin wearily as he slowly eased himself into the chair in front of the Commissioner\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened out there today, Robin?\u201d Gordon asked after a moment of awkward silence.\n\nRobin cleared his throat.\n\n\u201cWell, it all started last night at Sum Ting Wong.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Gordon pressed his hand against the side of his face and scrunched up his nose while shaking his head in disbelief.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you ate at that Health Inspector\u2019s nightmare again.\u201d\n\nRobin sighed.\n\n\u201cI know. I know. It\u2019s awful. But Bruc\u2014I mean\u2026the boss\u2026he\u2019s got a thing for their orange chicken. He just can\u2019t stay away.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you ate horrible food last night, got food poisoning, and this morning when the Bat Signal alerted you that the Joker was causing trouble downtown you were too busy hugging the toilet to show up in time?\u201d\n\nRobin winced.\n\n\u201cIf only it were that simple, Jim. Batman and I ordered a whole bunch of food last night. Orange chicken, broccoli and beef, egg drop soup; you name it, we got it. The order was so big that they wouldn\u2019t deliver \u2013 said their delivery boy\u2019s bike wouldn\u2019t hold it all. So we had to go pick it up. When we got there, it was pandemonium.\u201d Robin shuddered as he remembered the scene.\n________________________________________\n\nSum Ting Wong was in the seedy part of Gotham, which is to say, it fell outside the four square blocks immediately surrounding Wayne Enterprises. The run-down dingy building had a yellow pallor to it due to the fact that all the lights were covered in a thin film of grease. When you walked in, it didn\u2019t so much smell of a Chinese food place as it smelled of desperation to stay in business. Unlike every other Chinese place in the free world, this one was staffed entirely by massive white guys wearing wife beaters who looked like they had spent more time on the wrong side of a jail cell door than on the right side of it.\n\nA few seconds after Batman and Robin entered the establishment the prior evening, the electronic bell above the door made a jingling sound. Then it jingled again. And a third time. And a fourth. And it just kept on jingling.\n\nBatman covered his ears. \u201cWHAT ON EARTH?\u201d he shouted to Robin over the annoyingly pleasant sound.\n\nOne of the guys from the kitchen rushed up front, holding an industrial-sized burger flipper; which seemed out of place in a Chinese restaurant. He resembled the light bulbs in that he, too, was covered in a thin film of grease.\n\n\u201cWHADDYA WANT?\u201d he shouted over the bells.\n\n\u201cWHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BELL?\u201d Batman shouted back.\n\n\u201cIT\u2019S BROKEN. CAN\u2019T YOU TELL?\u201d yelled the man as he scratched his backside with the flipper. Robin gagged, but Batman didn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\n\u201cWHY DON\u2019T YOU JUST TURN IT OFF?\u201d Batman wondered out loud. Really out loud.\n\n\u201cIF I TURN IT OFF, HOW AM I GONNA KNOW WHEN A CUSTOMER COMES IN?\u201d\n\nBatman opened his mouth to answer, but was stopped in his tracks by the absurdity of the question. He shook his head dismissively.\n\n\u201cWE\u2019RE HERE TO PICK UP OUR ORDER!\u201d\n\nThe sound of the constantly jingling bells was beginning to wear on Robin\u2019s nerves. Now it was his turn to shout.\n\n\u201cYEAH, YOU KNOW, THE ONE YOU WOULDN\u2019T DELIVER?\u201d\n\nBatman eyed Robin sideways with a warning glance.\n\n\u201cOH YEAH, YOU GUYS. YOU GOT A REAL APPETITE ON YOU, YA KNOW THAT?\u201d without another word, the man disappeared into the kitchen.\n\n\u201cYOU\u2019D THINK THEY WOULD WANT TO DELIVER, TO GET OUT OF THIS JINGLING HELLHOLE FOR FIVE MINUTES!\u201d Robin yelled at Batman. Batman rolled his eyes.\n\nThe kitchen guy came back up front, followed by two others, each carrying as many bags as would fit in their arms.\n\n\u201cHEY, YOU GUYS ORDERED ENOUGH FOOD TO COVER MY PAYCHECK FOR A WHOLE WEEK!\u201d one of the guys said.\n\n\u201cTHEN YOU ARE GETTING SEVERELY UNDERPAID.\u201d Batman said, matter-of-factly.\n\nThe kitchen guy began to laugh, but Batman\u2019s face remained unamused and his laughter quickly subsided. Realization dawned on him and he lit up with a ding\u2026or rather, a jingle.\n\n\u201cHEY, YOU\u2019RE RIGHT. I AM GETTING SEVERELY UNDERPAID. I MADE WAY MORE MONEY SELLING DRUGS. GERALD, I QUIT.\u201d\n\nThe man unceremoniously dropped the bags he had been holding on the counter, took off his dirty apron, and walked out the front door. The jingling stopped for a glorious second as he opened the door, but started right up again as soon as the door closed again.\n\n\u201cLOOK WHAT YOU GONE AND DID! HE WAS MY BEST FRY COOK!\u201d\n\nThe guy with the flipper waved it threateningly as he took a step towards Batman.\n\n\u201cWHAT THE HELL DO YOU NEED A FRY COOK FOR IN A CHINESE RESTAURANT?\u201d Robin yelled.\n\nInstead of answering, Flipper Guy shoved the bags he was holding into Batman\u2019s arms, much to Batman\u2019s surprise. The remaining kitchen guy plopped his bags on top of the first batch, creating the comical image of Batman struggling to hold on to each bag without letting any of them fall.\n\nRobin scurried over to the pile of bags on the counter and grabbed them all as Flipper Guy shouted for them to get out. Robin could tell that he would have been shouting whether the bells were still jingling or not.\n\nOnce they stumbled through the door with their cornucopia of bags, the jingling of the electronic bell lingered. They climbed into the Batmobile and it roared to life.\n\n\u201cWHAT A MESS!\u201d Batman shouted.\n\n\u201cYOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO YELL ANYMORE!\u201d Robin yelled back.\n\n\u201cWHAT? I CAN STILL HEAR THOSE BLASTED BELLS!\u201d Batman yelled.\n\n\u201cLET\u2019S JUST GET BACK TO THE BAT CAVE AND EAT!\u201d Robin shouted back.\n________________________________________\n\nCommissioner Gordon\u2019s face was in his hands.\n\n\u201cOkay. So you almost got into a fight with the head fry cook at Sum Ting Wong. The bells were jingling enough to put anyone one edge. That still doesn\u2019t explain why you two didn\u2019t show up this morning.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner glanced at his watch. \u201cAnd please be quick about it, Robin, I have a 3:00 appointment.\u201d\n\nRobin took a deep breath and started recounting the night\u2019s events again.\n________________________________________\n\nBatman belched.\n\n\u201cOkay. That was the either the best beef and broccoli I\u2019ve ever tasted, or the worst. I\u2019ll let you know in the morning.\u201d\n\nRobin snorted as he brought a spoonful of egg drop soup to his lips. \u201cYou\u2019ll let me know tonight. You know every time you eat that stuff you get the farts like nobody\u2019s business. Did you have to eat the entire order? You\u2019ll be gassier than a November politician.\u201d\n\nBatman rolled his eyes as Robin swallowed the spoonful of soup \u2013 and began to choke.\n\nBatman leapt from his chair with a loud fart. He quickly made his way over to Robin, who had started choking even harder as the smell of Batman\u2019s gas hit him.\n\n\u201cMother of God!\u201d Batman muttered, and only the big man upstairs himself knows whether Batman was lamenting over Robin\u2019s predicament or the stench of rotting flesh that was now surrounding the both of them. It\u2019s very possible he was bewildered by both.\n\nBatman gave Robin a solid THWACK on the back, and Robin coughed a huge cough before sucking in a lungful of air and letting out a series of smaller gasping coughs. His eyes were watering and his face was red.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, Bruce, that was the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever smelled in my life. \n\nIf I hadn\u2019t had a lack of oxygen from choking to death I might have died!\u201d\n\nBatman rolled his eyes again.\n\n\u201cSeriously, Robin, who chokes on soup?\u201d\n\nRobin glared at Batman.\n\n\u201cSay what you want, but I swear to God there was a whole egg in my egg drop soup just now. I mean, it was a small egg\u2026like maybe a robin\u2019s egg or something\u2026but it was definitely an egg.\u201d\n\nBatman snorted with laughter.\n\n\u201cWait. Robin swallowed a robin\u2019s egg? Oh Jesus, I hope it comes out in one piece tomorrow. That would make my day. Robin laying an egg.\u201d\n\nBatman bent over and guffawed with laughter, and as he did he farted again, which only made him laugh harder.\n\nRobin plugged his nose and ran from the room.\n\n\u201cNo way am I staying here tonight, mate! I\u2019m out. See you in the morning!\u201d\n________________________________________\n\nCommissioner Gordon was looking at Robin as if he had an extra head.\n\n\u201cYou guys actually ATE that slop?\u201d\n\nRobin winced.\n\n\u201cYes, and after last night, never again. Seriously. I\u2019m banning Batman from even mentioning that place\u2019s name. He could have killed someone with those broccoli farts. I think sulfur is one of their key ingredients.\u201d\n\nNow it was Commissioner Gordon\u2019s turn to roll his eyes.\n\n\u201cPlease get on with your story, Robin.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, but the next part of the story I heard from Batman himself. I went home and went straight to bed. This is what he said happened last night after I went home.\u201d\n"], [1, "Commissioner Gordon, \n\nI know Batman and me promised you that we would capture The Joker for Christmas, but unfortunately he got away. Today was a complete and total mess for Batman and me. This morning, I woke up with indesrcibable abdominal cramps (I literally thought I was dying) and ran into the bathroom. After projectile vomiting onto the floor, I proceeded to sit on the toilet screaming in agony.\n\nAt this point, my screams had awakened Batman who ran into the bathroom to see what was happening and gasped in horror. At this point, I felt the urge to push, like a mom in labor, so I did. Batman grabbed my hand and aided me as best as he could. After what seemed like an eternity of pushing, I heard a giant plop into the toilet followed by a wave of relief. Upon looking into the toilet, we both gasped at the sight of a bloody egg at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nThis is the point where you called, Batman went into the kitchen to get some cleaning supplies for the blood and puke, while I collapsed in the hallway from exhaustion.\n\n\"Commissioner Gordon says that The Joker is peeing on the bathroom wall of the mayor's residence. There's no time to clean up Robin, duty calls.\"\n\nSo, still covered in puke and blood, I got into the Batmobile with Batman. He revved the engine, shifted into drive, and we blasted out of the Bat Cave. We were flooring it down the freeway with superhero style when one of the Batmobile's wheels flew off suddenly. This caused the Batmobile to spin out of control and slam into the median. Fortunately no civilians were harmed, but the spinning didn't help my nausea. I barely got out of Batmobile in time before I started puking again. \n\nWhile I was puking, Batman called Alfred for a lift to the mayor's residence. Unfortunately, it turned out that the entire Batman fleet was in the shop for repairs while his sports cars were getting detail work done. This left only one vehicle for us to use...the Volvo...yes, THAT Volvo. The one that is literally held together with chicken wire and prayers (I don't understand Batman's attachment to the stupid car). \n\nIt took about an hour for Alfred to reach us because the Volvo broke down several times and he had to stop for gas to boot. It wasn't hard to see the look of frustration on Alfred's face as I squeezed into the back of the two door while Batman sat in the front. At this point, the mayor called again wondering where we were.\n\n\"Where the fuck are you Batman? The Joker is making a mess of my house!\"\n\n\"We'll be there shortly. The Batmobile lost a wheel so we had to use the Volvo.\"\n\n\"That Volvo? Well, be here soon. I don't want The Joker to get away.\"\n\n\"He won't.\"\n\nUpon reaching the mayor's house, we were met with a crowd of Gotham's elite standing on the lawn staring at the house while the mayor ran down to the car to meet us.\n\n\"Thank God you made it, one of my guard's tried pulling The Joker out of the bathroom a few minutes ago but The Joker just threw his body out of the window.\"\n\nAs we entered the house, several of the mayor's guards were standing outside of the bathroom with their guns drawn. Batman gestured for them to push back while we approached the door.\n\n\"Joker. You know you can't get away with doing stuff like this.\"\n\n\"It's about time you arrived Batman...I was starting to get bored. Did your little bird enjoy that little surprise this morning?\"\n\n\"You were behind that?\"\n\nBatman tried to suppress his laughter thinking that I wouldn't notice (I did. Which only made me angrier at him) and proceeded to kick down the door. As we burst into the bathroom, The Joker cackled and hopped out of the window, but not before dropping a grenade into the toilet.\n\n\"Sorry to drop the bomb on you Batman, but I have to go!\"\n\nWe barely made it out of the bathroom before it got engulfed from the explosion. The force of the explosion knocked us onto floor (we both still have ringing in our ears). Unfortunately, The Joker managed to escape amidst the ensuing chaos.\n\nSo that's why The Joker managed to get away Commissioner Gordon. Fortunately, it will only be a matter of time before The Joker will peep his head out again and we won't have to deal with the Volvo next time. We assure you, Commissioner, he will be caught.\n\nRobin."]], [[{"comment": "Commissioner Gordon storms through the hospital; his lieutenant chasing after him.\n\nHe bursts into a room.

He quickly made his way over to Robin, who had started choking even harder as the smell of Batman\u2019s gas hit him.\n\n\u201cMother of God!\u201d Batman muttered, and only the big man upstairs himself knows whether Batman was lamenting over Robin\u2019s predicament or the stench of rotting flesh that was now surrounding the both of them. It\u2019s very possible he was bewildered by both.\n\nBatman gave Robin a solid THWACK on the back, and Robin coughed a huge cough before sucking in a lungful of air and letting out a series of smaller gasping coughs. His eyes were watering and his face was red.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, Bruce, that was the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever smelled in my life. \n\nIf I hadn\u2019t had a lack of oxygen from choking to death I might have died!\u201d\n\nBatman rolled his eyes again.\n\n\u201cSeriously, Robin, who chokes on soup?\u201d\n\nRobin glared at Batman.\n\n\u201cSay what you want, but I swear to God there was a whole egg in my egg drop soup just now. I mean, it was a small egg\u2026like maybe a robin\u2019s egg or something\u2026but it was definitely an egg.\u201d\n\nBatman snorted with laughter.\n\n\u201cWait. Robin swallowed a robin\u2019s egg? Oh Jesus, I hope it comes out in one piece tomorrow. That would make my day. Robin laying an egg.\u201d\n\nBatman bent over and guffawed with laughter, and as he did he farted again, which only made him laugh harder.\n\nRobin plugged his nose and ran from the room.\n\n\u201cNo way am I staying here tonight, mate! I\u2019m out. See you in the morning!\u201d\n________________________________________\n\nCommissioner Gordon was looking at Robin as if he had an extra head.\n\n\u201cYou guys actually ATE that slop?\u201d\n\nRobin winced.\n\n\u201cYes, and after last night, never again. Seriously. I\u2019m banning Batman from even mentioning that place\u2019s name. He could have killed someone with those broccoli farts. I think sulfur is one of their key ingredients.\u201d\n\nNow it was Commissioner Gordon\u2019s turn to roll his eyes.\n\n\u201cPlease get on with your story, Robin.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine, but the next part of the story I heard from Batman himself. I went home and went straight to bed. This is what he said happened last night after I went home.\u201d\n", "id": "dar7u85"}, {"comment": "________________________________________\n\nBatman was doubled over in pain. His stomach was gurgling like someone had poured vinegar and baking soda directly into it. His gas was getting worse, in frequency and smell.\n\nHe decided to return to Sum Ting Wong and give that fry cook a piece of his mind\u2026and possibly a piece of his stench, too.\n\nWhen he walked in, the stupid bell was still jingling. He didn\u2019t know how they hadn\u2019t all killed each other by now. He let out another fart and a moment later, the jingling sound distorted and made a gurgling sound before stopping altogether.\n\nAt the lack of jingling, Flipper Guy came up through the kitchen. His eyes worked faster than his nose and he furrowed his brow and opened his mouth to yell at Batman some more. Then he staggered backwards as his face contorted to a look of horror.\n\n\u201cWHAT THE HELL, MAN? HAVEN\u2019T YOU DONE ENOUGH TO US TONIGHT? GET OUT OF HERE! PLEASE, JUST GO!\u201d\n\nFlipper Guy raised his stained wife beater to cover his nose and eyes, both of which had started streaming freely. He backed into the kitchen. Batman heard his muffled yells through the door.\n\n\u201cGET OUT OF HERE BEFORE SOMEONE CALLS THE HEALTH INSPECTOR SAYING WE\u2019VE GOT DEAD RATS IN HERE AGAIN, MAN. I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU GET US SHUT DOWN\u2026\u201d\n\nBatman sighed and turned to leave before Flipper Guy could finish his sentence.\n\nWhen he got out to the Batmobile, he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. One of his friggin\u2019 tires was gone! There was a note taped to the tire well. Batman growled and ripped the note off and read it.\n\n\u2018Hey, man, sorry for takin\u2019 your tire. Had to have something to sell to get me back in the drug game. Thanks for the suggestion, I couldn\u2019t have done it without you!\u2019\n\nBatman crumpled the note and slammed it to the ground. He whipped out his Bat phone and tried to dial Robin. It rang twenty times before going to voice mail. \n\nThen he tried Alfred with the same result.\n\nBatman sighed and dialed a taxi company.\n\nForty minutes later, the crying cabbie dropped Batman off in front of his bat cave. \n\nHe wouldn\u2019t even take payment from Batman, just begged him for mercy. Without even waiting for Batman to close the cab door, the tires squealed and the cab was off.\n\nBatman went up to his room and climbed into bed with a sigh. His stomach was still gurgling like crazy. He usually meditated before bed, but with one final fart, the stench was enough to knock him out completely.\n________________________________________\n\n\u201cYou realize this sounds utterly ridiculous.\u201d Commissioner Gordon said.\n\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? I mean, c\u2019mon. Batman farted himself unconscious? If I hadn\u2019t smelled one of his farts last night myself, I wouldn\u2019t believe it. But Jim, you have to understand\u2026this flatulence was something straight out of a horror movie. It was like The Mist, only instead of monsters everyone just died from the fumes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever. You still haven\u2019t actually answered my question. What the hell happened this morning?\u201d\n________________________________________\n\nBatman awoke with a start. The heavy stench of death hung in the air. His phone was ringing and his stomach was still gurgling desperately. He picked up his phone without looking to see who it was.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d he growled.\n\n\u201cBatman, get your ass over here now! The Commissioner\u2019s been calling for half an hour, the Bat Signal is going crazy. The Joker is downtown terrorizing citizens!\u201d\n\nBatman sat up with a start. He cradled the phone between his face and shoulder as he hopped around his room pulling on his Bat Pants. He reached into his pocket for the keys to the\u2026oh, shit.\n\n\u201cOh my God. Robin, I need you to pick me up. The Batmobile lost a wheel last night and it\u2019s still parked outside of Sum Ting Wong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Did you go BACK to that slime pit? Please don\u2019t tell me you ordered more broccoli and beef.\u201d\n\nBatman grunted. \u201cNO, I went back to complain to the stupid Flipper Guy and the dumb kitchen guy stole one of my tires so he could sell it for drugs to sell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? That doesn\u2019t even make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody ever said criminals were smart, Robin. Can you pick me up or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh\u2026yeah, but we\u2019ll have to take my mom\u2019s car.\u201d\n\nBatman sighed.\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine. Just get here. And hurry.\u201d\n\nRobin pulled up 10 minutes later in his mother\u2019s sunshine yellow Volkswagen Beetle. Batman pulled the flower off of the antennae and ground it into the gravel with the heel of his boot before climbing into the passenger\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this seat go back any further? I feel like I\u2019m doing damn yoga in this thing.\u201d Batman grumbled not ten seconds later. His knees were bent up to his chest as he perched on the seat, unable to fit his legs in the teensy leg space of the tiny vehicle.\n\n\u201cSorry, bud. That\u2019s as far back as it goes. You\u2019re going to have to live with it.\u201d\nThe tires squealed and the duo flew out of the driveway as fast as the little Beetle would allow.\n\nHalfway there, Batman\u2019s stomach gurgled. Before he could tell Robin to roll down his window, he let out a twenty-second squeaking fart that would have been impressive had it not been strong enough to be classified a weapon of mass destruction.\n\nRobin immediately started gagging. The car was too small and the stench too concentrated. Robin pulled over to the side of the road, leapt out of the car, and started getting sick in a gutter.\n\nBatman hopped out of the car as well, not wanting to pass out again.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Robin, get back in. We have to go get the Joker!\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-uh. No friggin\u2019 way. I\u2019m walking. You are dangerous. Stay 20 feet behind me at all times, I don\u2019t want to be downwind of you for the next week.\u201d\n________________________________________\n\n\u201cSo\u2026by the time we got there, the Joker was long gone. He had gotten away. I\u2019m really sorry and I promise it won\u2019t happen again. Thanks for hearing me out, Commissioner Gordon! I\u2019ve really got to go now!\u201d\n\nRobin\u2019s last sentences were rushed, and Commissioner Gordon noticed he was looking a little more flustered than he had when he first came in. He stood up, a concerned look on his face.\n\n\u201cRobin? What\u2019s going on? Why the sudden rush?\u201d\n\nRobin had leapt out of his chair and hastily shook the Commissioner\u2019s hand, and was quickly backing towards the door.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026remember that egg I swallowed whole last night, Jim? I think it\u2019s about time for it to make its reappearance, and I get the feeling that Batman is going to get his wish for it to come out in one piece. So, uh, basically, to recap: Um...Jingle bells. Batman smells. I'm gonna lay an egg. The Batmobile has lost a wheel. And, well, the Joker got away. Sorry! Bye!\u201d\n\nWith that, Robin turned and ran from the Commissioner\u2019s office.\n\nCommissioner Gordon sat at his desk and rubbed his temples.", "id": "dar7upi"}], [{"comment": "Commissioner Gordon, \n\nI know Batman and me promised you that we would capture The Joker for Christmas, but unfortunately he got away. Today was a complete and total mess for Batman and me. This morning, I woke up with indesrcibable abdominal cramps (I literally thought I was dying) and ran into the bathroom. After projectile vomiting onto the floor, I proceeded to sit on the toilet screaming in agony.\n\nAt this point, my screams had awakened Batman who ran into the bathroom to see what was happening and gasped in horror. At this point, I felt the urge to push, like a mom in labor, so I did. Batman grabbed my hand and aided me as best as he could. After what seemed like an eternity of pushing, I heard a giant plop into the toilet followed by a wave of relief. Upon looking into the toilet, we both gasped at the sight of a bloody egg at the bottom of the toilet.\n\nThis is the point where you called, Batman went into the kitchen to get some cleaning supplies for the blood and puke, while I collapsed in the hallway from exhaustion.\n\n\"Commissioner Gordon says that The Joker is peeing on the bathroom wall of the mayor's residence. There's no time to clean up Robin, duty calls.\"\n\nSo, still covered in puke and blood, I got into the Batmobile with Batman. He revved the engine, shifted into drive, and we blasted out of the Bat Cave. We were flooring it down the freeway with superhero style when one of the Batmobile's wheels flew off suddenly. This caused the Batmobile to spin out of control and slam into the median. Fortunately no civilians were harmed, but the spinning didn't help my nausea. I barely got out of Batmobile in time before I started puking again. \n\nWhile I was puking, Batman called Alfred for a lift to the mayor's residence. Unfortunately, it turned out that the entire Batman fleet was in the shop for repairs while his sports cars were getting detail work done. This left only one vehicle for us to use...the Volvo...yes, THAT Volvo. The one that is literally held together with chicken wire and prayers (I don't understand Batman's attachment to the stupid car). \n\nIt took about an hour for Alfred to reach us because the Volvo broke down several times and he had to stop for gas to boot. It wasn't hard to see the look of frustration on Alfred's face as I squeezed into the back of the two door while Batman sat in the front. At this point, the mayor called again wondering where we were.\n\n\"Where the fuck are you Batman? The Joker is making a mess of my house!\"\n\n\"We'll be there shortly. The Batmobile lost a wheel so we had to use the Volvo.\"\n\n\"That Volvo? Well, be here soon. I don't want The Joker to get away.\"\n\n\"He won't.\"\n\nUpon reaching the mayor's house, we were met with a crowd of Gotham's elite standing on the lawn staring at the house while the mayor ran down to the car to meet us.\n\n\"Thank God you made it, one of my guard's tried pulling The Joker out of the bathroom a few minutes ago but The Joker just threw his body out of the window.\"\n\nAs we entered the house, several of the mayor's guards were standing outside of the bathroom with their guns drawn. Batman gestured for them to push back while we approached the door.\n\n\"Joker. You know you can't get away with doing stuff like this.\"\n\n\"It's about time you arrived Batman...I was starting to get bored. Did your little bird enjoy that little surprise this morning?\"\n\n\"You were behind that?\"\n\nBatman tried to suppress his laughter thinking that I wouldn't notice (I did. Which only made me angrier at him) and proceeded to kick down the door. As we burst into the bathroom, The Joker cackled and hopped out of the window, but not before dropping a grenade into the toilet.\n\n\"Sorry to drop the bomb on you Batman, but I have to go!\"\n\nWe barely made it out of the bathroom before it got engulfed from the explosion. The force of the explosion knocked us onto floor (we both still have ringing in our ears). Unfortunately, The Joker managed to escape amidst the ensuing chaos.\n\nSo that's why The Joker managed to get away Commissioner Gordon. Fortunately, it will only be a matter of time before The Joker will peep his head out again and we won't have to deal with the Volvo next time. We assure you, Commissioner, he will be caught.\n\nRobin.", "id": "dar29fo"}]]], "5gdas3": ["[WP] One night, people around the world begin to notice they have no reflection in the mirror anymore.", "2016-12-04 05:35:13", 2, "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5gdas3/wp_one_night_people_around_the_world_begin_to/", [[1, "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n"]], [[{"comment": "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n", "id": "darbwyo"}]]], "5gcfj9": ["[WP] You are part of an immortal and invincible speciaes, but now a virus is spreading across the world and news report immortals dying", "2016-12-04 02:25:32", 4, "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5gcfj9/wp_you_are_part_of_an_immortal_and_invincible/", [[1, "\"News reports come in of citizens dying, after a mysterious virus has been contracted in New York.

Only the gun pressed against his neck could convince him of this reality.\n\n\u201cWhat is taking so long?!\u201d barked the large gunman. His much smaller associate, napping in the corner, startled awake.\n\n\u201cWhy must you be so loud, Konta?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d \n\nThe gun pressed deeper into Nathaniel\u2019s neck. The sweat now readily poured from his head onto the keyboard. \n\n\u201cPlease\u201d, begged Nathaniel. \u201cPlease, you have taken all the money I had on hand. All the money that I promised you in return for my wife. $50, 000 nairas. Please just let her go. \u201c\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not, Prince Nathaniel Zalani\u201d. Konta continued to lace his words with more and more venom. \u201cI know how much you are worth. Your wife is trapped in Lagos and you are here slacking. Just one word from me and Tofil\u2026\u201d, the associate in the corner lazily waved from where he was sitting, \u201cwill send the message that you have failed and you will die.

It had been two days since the kidnappers had separated him from his wife. Two days since he was dragged into a dingy apartment in Ibadan, put behind the keyboard of a laptop, and told to transfer all the money in his Nigerian bank account to these thieves. \nWhen they figured out that he was indeed royalty, and that the rest of his substantial wealth lay in a Swiss bank, they kept him behind the laptop in an attempt to get access to that money. But by then the news broke of he and his wife missing and the Swiss bankers had closed off access to his account.\n\nNathaniel tried everything he could think of to get someone to help him. Finally, Facebook was his last chance. The man typing, John Beckman in Idaho, seemed kindly in his profile pictures. With John, his wife, and his family beaming up at him, Nathaniel held on to hope as John\u2019s message finally appeared.\n\n\u201co fuck u\u201d\n\nNathaniel blinked.\n\n\u201cu mean to tell me that some moneky in nigeria has 90,000,000 dollars in some bank acct in switzerland\u201d\n\n\u201cand tht ur gonna give me 30, 000 if i can get it out 4 u;\u201d\n\n\u201c4 ur dumass wife in lagos\u201d\n\n\u201cwtf\u201d\n\n\u201clol yall prolly don\u2019t have that in the entire country\u201d\n\nNathaniel\u2019s stomach dropped and he suddenly felt the sensation of not being able to feel any of his extremities. Except, of course, for the gun pressed deeply into the side of his head.\n\n\u201cYour time is up!\u201d\n\u201cPlease!

Only the gun pressed against his neck could convince him of this reality.\n\n\u201cWhat is taking so long?!\u201d barked the large gunman. His much smaller associate, napping in the corner, startled awake.\n\n\u201cWhy must you be so loud, Konta?\u201d\n\u201cQuiet!\u201d \n\nThe gun pressed deeper into Nathaniel\u2019s neck. The sweat now readily poured from his head onto the keyboard. \n\n\u201cPlease\u201d, begged Nathaniel. \u201cPlease, you have taken all the money I had on hand. All the money that I promised you in return for my wife. $50, 000 nairas. Please just let her go. \u201c\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not, Prince Nathaniel Zalani\u201d. Konta continued to lace his words with more and more venom. \u201cI know how much you are worth. Your wife is trapped in Lagos and you are here slacking. Just one word from me and Tofil\u2026\u201d, the associate in the corner lazily waved from where he was sitting, \u201cwill send the message that you have failed and you will die. And your wife,\u201d Konta began to smile lasciviously, \u201cwill have to make it all up.\u201d The gun moved from Nathaniel\u2019s neck to his right temple. \u201cNow,\u201d continued Konta, \u201cwhat is taking so long?!\u201d\nAlmost as if on cue, the messenger screen displayed a different message.\n\n\u201cSomeone is typing\u2026\u201d\n\nNathaniel hoped against hope that he chose correctly this time. It had been two days since the kidnappers had separated him from his wife. Two days since he was dragged into a dingy apartment in Ibadan, put behind the keyboard of a laptop, and told to transfer all the money in his Nigerian bank account to these thieves. \nWhen they figured out that he was indeed royalty, and that the rest of his substantial wealth lay in a Swiss bank, they kept him behind the laptop in an attempt to get access to that money. But by then the news broke of he and his wife missing and the Swiss bankers had closed off access to his account.\n\nNathaniel tried everything he could think of to get someone to help him. Finally, Facebook was his last chance. The man typing, John Beckman in Idaho, seemed kindly in his profile pictures. With John, his wife, and his family beaming up at him, Nathaniel held on to hope as John\u2019s message finally appeared.\n\n\u201co fuck u\u201d\n\nNathaniel blinked.\n\n\u201cu mean to tell me that some moneky in nigeria has 90,000,000 dollars in some bank acct in switzerland\u201d\n\n\u201cand tht ur gonna give me 30, 000 if i can get it out 4 u;\u201d\n\n\u201c4 ur dumass wife in lagos\u201d\n\n\u201cwtf\u201d\n\n\u201clol yall prolly don\u2019t have that in the entire country\u201d\n\nNathaniel\u2019s stomach dropped and he suddenly felt the sensation of not being able to feel any of his extremities. Except, of course, for the gun pressed deeply into the side of his head.\n\n\u201cYour time is up!\u201d\n\u201cPlease! Just give me one more chance!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had your chances!\u201d\n\nFrom the corner of his eye, Nathaniel spied Tofil moving and looking out the window of the apartment. \n\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Konta\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d\n\nSuddenly, a loud explosion drew everyone\u2019s attention to the door.\n\n\u201cEVERYONE ON THE GROUND, NOW!\u201d\n\nNot missing a beat, Nathaniel dived for the floor along with Tofil.

Wasn't always this way. Used to throw on my orange apron, walk up and down these aisles, restock some boxes of screws or paint brushes, get chewed out by my supervisor, and maybe help a customer or two. It was boring but I liked it that way.\n\nBut lately, something strange has been happening. As I do my work, a crowd follows me, watching everything I do and taking notes. First, it started with this one fellow. Now, I'm a pretty open minded guy - race doesn't matter a lick to me - but you don't see many hispanic guys named Angel in Hoover, Alabama. So he stuck out at first. Angel would follow me around the store with his phone out, taking pics and tweeting what I was doing. I thought it was strange, but he wasn't bothering me none so I didn't mind. Hell, maybe I'll go viral and get flown out to see Ellen. Karen (my wife) would like that.\n\nAfter about a week, another person started following me as well - Maria. Then a few days later, another. Then another. Before I knew it, I had a crowd of ten or so Hispanic people, following me around work. It was bewildering! My supervisor (who didn't like me much to begin with) got mad and started yelling at me, like it was somehow my fault that I had a posse trailing me around the store. First, my supervisor tried kicking them out of the store, but that didn't work. They kept sneaking back in. Then he tried calling the police on them. That worked for a day or two, but then they came back in. My supervisor got the police chief on the phone to ask 'What the hell!?' but the police chief said that this goes up. *Way up*. Something about a senator and 'regime destabilization.' \n\nSo now, that's where I'm at. I have my fan club, which is what I like to call them, following me around work everyday. They do their best to not get in the way, and sometimes even pitch in a hand if I'm restocking or cleaning something up. I once asked them what they were doing and they said something about being freedom fighters and something else about South American black markets. I'm not one for economics and politics, so I nodded my head genially and went back to price labeling our  outdoor furniture collection. \n\nI don't why me or why Home Depot. I don't know why my boring life had to get this way. But what I do know is this - Ellen is flying me and Karen out next week and my honey couldn't be happier - so thanks Angel!"], [1452, "Derrick got out of his car and rubbed his eyes, heading to another graveyard shift. He always hated these times, waking up at 11 at night, to work until 6 the next morning, going home to his girlfriend, and trying to get as much sleep as possible. His income was barely above minimum wage, and he always struggled to curb his drug addiction. The store felt like it was draining his soul and he wanted out.\n\n\nExcept two months ago, he began to notice weird things. The same customer, who went by Eduardo, would come in with a well-trimmed suit each week and ask for his advice on whatever. Lately, that advice had been solely about economics. How much should x cost compared to y? How much x should be produced a month? Derrick didn't know anything about economics, so it was mostly shrugs at first, but at the months went on, Derrick started giving him phony answers just so he could leave him alone. Then checks started coming in his mail. The checks came from a Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (whoever that was), and every week he would get them for the same amount. Not enough to make him rich or anything, but enough to pay the rent.\n\n\nDerrick opened the front door and clocked in. He went to the cashier stand, and just sat there waiting for customers. Surprisingly, Home Depot was actually busy this time of day; more than a few night owls would be perusing the shelves looking for whatever they needed. A few minutes into his shift, he saw a man in a suit walk in. Instead of Eduardo, though, it was a middle-aged man of about 55 who came straight to Derrick.\n\n\n\"Are you Derrick Manuel?\"\n\n\n\"Uhh, yeah. How can I help you tonight?\" Derrick really was tired, being up at an ungodly hour. He tried his best to smile like he was payed to do.\n\n\n\"I'm Michael Stevens, and I'm with the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions regarding this man. Have you ever seen him?\"\n\n\nStevens pulled out a photo of Eduardo, only everything about it seemed strange. Eduardo was in a military uniform, wearing a general's beret and holding a cigar in his hand, standing beside five or ten men in similar uniforms and helmets. Derrick didn't know how to react. There's no way that could be Eduardo.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, what? Why are you showing me this?\"\n\n\n\"May I remind you that it's illegal to interfere in an investigation? Have you seen this man?\"\n\n\n\"Maybe, I don't know? We get a lot of customers.\" Derrick couldn't believe what was coming out of his mouth. Did he just lie to the FBI? This couldn't go down well anymore. Should he confess? *No, that would just make me a suspect. Damn it, I'm in too deep.*\n\n\n\"Okay, let me show you another picture.\" Stevens puts his hand in his suit and produces another photo, this time of Eduardo in the Home Depot talking with Derrick at the register.\n\n\n\"Yeah, like I said, we have a lot of customers.\" *Oh crap*\n\n\n\"Could you tell me then why you--\"\n\n\n\"Stevens!\" A younger agent comes walking speedily, and whispers in Stevens' ear. They then go a few paces away, and start conversing. Derrick felt nervous. *Should I ask them. Am I in trouble? Sh***t, I'm in trouble aren't I?*\n\n\nStevens turns around and calmly says \"We have no further questions, thank you for your time.\"\n\n\nDerrick didn't know what to make of it. He finished the shift and few hours later, but couldn't get the experience out of his mind. When he got back to his apartment, he found his girlfriend asleep, and opened his laptop to check his e-mails. He found one new e-mail in his inbox, timestamped at about half an hour after the conversation, reading \"Good job not blowing our cover. Meet us in the alleyway behind Bernard St. at 2:07 for more instructions.\"\n\n\nDerrick did nothing but stare blankly, thinking to himself *What did I just get myself into?*\n\n********\nPart 2 is up.

You can tell him that the box of nails he was looking for is on the break room table.\"\n\n\"No, it ain't him.

He's in the break room you said?\"\n\nVincent DeFris nodded, easing off the pallets and moving towards his garden department. \"Yeah, I hope you speak Spanish, cause he's yammering about things like 'Destabilizing the Bolivar, crippling South American interests in the near and far future.' Weird Mexican shit man.\"\n\nJanus sighed with exasperation, as Vinny vanished around a corner. \"He's from Venezuela, you dumb fuc- Oh forget it, it's like trying to wipe your ass with your elbows; you won't succeed and you'll just spread shit everywhere.\"  \n\n"], [72, "Working at a Home Depot in Alabama is not the best job in the world; the pay kind of sucks and my hours are all over the place. It has been tough not seeing the family as much this past couple months.\n\nThe one thing that has kind of made it easier to the fact that I am the go-to forklift guy at this store. I guess they had a few incidences in the past that cost the place at lot of money. To me it is fun. Well it was fun until last week.\n\nLast week a guy came in and just watched me replace a stack of drywall. I thought he has impressed with the machine or my driving skills? I didn't think too much about it, even when he showed up the next day. Just standing there for hours typing on his phone and taking photos of me. On the third day I had to ask him what the hell was up.\n\nI half expected him to run out of the store as I approached, but to my surprised he looked very excited to see me coming towards him. He did something on his phone and just stood there. When I starting to ask exactly what he was doing he put the phone right in my face almost hitting me in the mouth. I just said \"Can I help you sir?\". No response. The phone was still in my face.\n\nSo I asked again in a less friendly tone. \"Can I help you sir? What do you want?\"\n\nHe pulled the phone away and started typing again. Annoyed, I stood in front of him not knowing what to do next. While still looking down at his phone and typing whatever it was he was typing, the man turned around and walked away. Right out of the store.\n\nHe's been coming everyday ever since. I don't really notice him until I'm doing something on the forklift. There wasn't really a reason to be worried about losing my job until today. I told my manager what has been going on and he just shrugged his shoulders. The guy wasn't hurting anything so why get bothered by it?\n\nBut today after moving some pallets, the man who has been watching me came up to me. I wasn't scared. He's actually pretty small so why would I be? Well, he walked up and in broken English said, \"Use other carry-car tomorrow.\" Understanding what he said but not understanding why he said it, I just said \"what?\" with a half blank, half confused face. After this he handed me a large bag of some weird looking money.\n\nI am talking about a lot of bills. If these were US bills then I'd be set for life. But these had foreign writing (probably Spanish?) and had some guy with amazing sideburns on the front\n\nI'm not going to the police yet. Also don't know if I'm going to use the other forklift tomorrow at work. Pretty sure that's what he meant when he said to use the other carry-car.

In the back of the Home Depot we were lifting some plastic boxes on to the loading pallet. I heard glass shatter behind me and the whirr of tires, and I whirled around, and noticed something like a wide straw that was\u2026smoking?\n\nA pipe bomb. \n\nI just stared at it like an idiot, my mind struggling to comprehend what had just happened, when Eduardo, my co-worker, screamed \u201cfucking hell!\u201d and literally grabbed and pulled me behind the mahogany table 5 feet away just as the explosion went off.\n\nI was unimpressed. Like, explosions are supposed to be big, bright and *powerful,* you know? But behind the table, I felt absolutely nothing, no concussion wave no bright flash. Just a hiss.\n\nI turned towards Ed to ask him something but put a finger to his lips when I turned to look at him, and pulled out a freaking pistol from his jeans. \n\nWhat the hell?\n\nEd seemed like a normal enough guy, his skin was an olive color, he was average height, dark eyes, short hair\u2026that\u2019s it. Not the kind of guy you would expect to carry a gun. \n\nThat\u2019s when I heard the door of the front entrance opening, and soft, muffled footsteps. I moved to peek over at who was coming but Eduardo yanked me back, and I gave a little yelp. Immediately, a serious of thuds wnt through my head that was leaning against the table.\n\nSomeone had just tried to shoot me.\n\nEduardo immediately got up and shot towards the door. Where the person who had fired at us made no noise, Eduardo\u2019s gun was *loud,* very loud. He shot 4 times, pausing momentarily after each shot as I lay behind the table covering my ears. \nEduardo quickly tapped my shoulder and motioned for me to get up. He checked his gun and put some more bullets in it. \u201cAnd Oliver thought this was paranoia\u2026\u201d he muttered. Then turning to me he commanded, \u201cHurry up, more might be on the way.\u201d \n\nToo shocked to question him, I took his hand and we ran towards the front door. But what I saw made me stop dead in my tracks in spite it all. The box I had dropped had spilled other boxes. Kind of like nesting dolls, but what was strange was that between the boxes were glass rocks\u2026diamonds.\n\nThe boxes that were supposed to be going to Venezuela. \n\nOh crap. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been *smuggling diamonds to Argentina?!*\u201d I asked Ed incredulously. \n\nEd ignored me and continued pulling me towards the door, where a body was lying.

But now every other Saturday it turns into a Mecca of tailgating zealots that believe Nick Saban is a reincarnation of sweet baby Jesus himself.  \"Fucking move\", I yell at the Crimson Winnebago in front of me as I slam on my brakes. The big game starts in an hour and Game-day traffic around here is just the worst. At this point It's pretty clear that there's an accident ahead. Fuck. I've already been tardy 2 times to work this month, and I just can't deal with this right now. With 11 minutes to go I decide I'm better off on foot. I pull my small Civic on to the side of the 359-N, grab my orange apron out of the backseat, and I'm off.\n\nIt was a hard half a mile hike but I made it only 5 minutes late . I was greeted at the door by a rush of cool air and Manuel, who is the Shift Manger on duty. I was happy to see his face since Mark was way more likely to ring me out but Manuel was cool. \"Hey, I'm going to need you to stack some more styrofoam coolers in the front\". Of course. If there is anything you're guaranteed to sell a ton of on Game day in Alabama is Keystone Light and styrofoam coolers.  As I stack the coolers I notice that we're running low on our portable grills as well so I call in to Manuel to have the forklift come around with fresh inventory. \n\n\"Both our Forklift drivers are out\", Manuel calls back in through the radio. \"You finished your Forklift certifications last week didn't you?\" I had but I replied with some uncertainty because there's a lot of foot traffic around today. \"Listen,\" Manuel retorted, \"If you want Mark to value you as a worker you're going to have to pull some weight around here\". And in this case he meant literal weight, as in the form of portable grills.\n\nI begrudgingly find the Forklift and drive it around the back to pick up a stack of Foreman Gas grills. Everything seemed to be going alright, until I backed hard into a shelf of door panels, toppling it over with incredible force. I call in on the radio only to hear static at the bottom of the pile. Fuck..Manuel was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThat day I learned Manuel was the son of the Minister of finance in Venezuela, who upon learning about the death of his estranged first-born went temporarily insane. [Shortly after, the father instituted a fixed currency exchange rate that ran the country into the ground](http://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-economy-idUSL2N17822X) . Anyway, that's the story of how I unknowingly fucked up the Venezuelan economy by coming into work.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the constructive criticism guys. Never really saw myself posting on r/writingprompts but as an Alabamian I had to give it a shot. "], [9, "\"Yo, Joisey!\" the assistant manager shouted in a mocking Long Island accent. \"Getcho' ass back to work, your break's ovuh!\"\n\nSheila sighed and took a long sip from her coffee cup and placed it in the break room sink. She'd only been in Alabama for six months but she couldn't stand the humidity, the heat, and \u2014 worst of all \u2014 the men. She had heard that there was a certain machismo that emanated from Southern men, but she never realized just how often they had to prove their worth.\n\nSheila herself was born and raised a few towns away from Asbury Park by the beach. Her father was a Polish immigrant and her mother was from a small village in Venezuela called Trujillo. She had been raised back and forth between all three countries, and her father was very generous with the locals in her mother's home town. \"Always give back,\" her father would say, \"because you never know who you're going to be relying on later.\" Those words echoed today of all days, as she came to the realization that today was exactly six months since they moved out to Alabama since her mother's death.\n\nBack at the register, Sheila scanned various customers' items, not thinking much of who she was attending to or what she was scanning. \"Thanks for shopping at Home Depot,\" she muttered robotically, \"Would you like your receipt?\" And the day drilled on, customer after customer, the occasional complaint here and there, and sometimes someone's smile was enough to get her out of her funk momentarily, but never quite enough to pull her out of it for longer than a flash.\n\nYet another customer strolled to her line with a ticket for a larger item they kept outside. Something about her struck her as odd\u2026 familiar, even. The woman was definitely middle aged, if not tiptoeing graciously into her early 50s. Her blood orange shawl wrapped around her neck like a rooster's wattle, and her thick aviators covered nearly half of her slim face.\n\n\"I can have someone help you bring this into your car, ma'am,\" she sighed to the woman, making eye contact as well as she could from behind her sunglasses.\n\n\"\u00bfY a m\u00ed no me *podr\u00edah* ayudar t\u00fa *mihma*?\"^1 the woman asked briskly in a very marked Venezuelan accent. ^(1 And you can't help me yourself?)\n\n\"\u00bfC-c\u00f3mo?\"^2 Sheila wasn't used to anyone speaking in Spanish to her here. After all, her father was from Poland, and he effectively whitewashed her skin tone with his Eastern European genes. Most of her friends back North didn't even believe she was part Venezuelan until she spoke to them in Spanish. \"How could this woman have known?\" she asked herself, flustered. ^(2 W-what?)\n\n\"A ver, que ya no me *reconoceh*, \u00a1a tu propia mam\u00e1 encima!\" ^(Let's see, you can't tell who I am, your own mother, even!)\n\nSheila turned paler than a white paint can. \"\u00bfM-mam\u00e1?\" she gasped, tears starting to well up in her eyes. \"Pero\u2026\" ^(But\u2026)\n\nThe petite woman extended her arm to place her hand on her daughter's. In English, she responded, \"We have little time. The government is on to me, but I couldn't let them take us both down. After they threatened to assassinate me for tinkering with the bolivar, I fled, but they're coming back for you because they think you had a hand in it.\"\n\n\"You can't be serious right now, mam\u00e1!\" Sheila shouted, drowning in a flood of tears. She clasped her hand back to her chest away from her mother. \"How could you?!\" As quickly as her face turned flush, it glowed red in pure ire.\n\n\"Please understand, mija\u2026\"^3 The woman, raising her glasses to reveal her eyes, stared right into her daughter's soul. \"I'm so sorry I did this to you, but we need to leave. Ahora^4.\" Sheila's mother didn't blink. It was definitely her. It couldn't be anybody else. Nobody else on the planet shared those galactic green eyes. ^(3 my child; 4 now)\n\nSheila's breathing became quicker and quicker, her hands started to tremble and her head began to spin. \"Venga,\" she anxiously spat, \"que te explicar\u00e1s en el auto.\"^5 The second she ticked her lane's light off, she gingerly picked her mother's tender hand and placed it on her chest. \"I missed you so much, mam\u00e1.\" ^(5 C'mon, you can explain in the car)"], [8, "\"Alright, Weezlboys and Weezlettes, I got some bad news. Papa Weezl needs yours truly to take some more hours at the store, so I'm gonna be streaming once a week now on, instead of bi-weekly. I gotta do my part, since his arthritis is acting up. I still love you guys, though, and I'll see you next Tuesday. Weezlboy signing out!\"\n\nWith that, I pressed F7 to cut the stream, closed out of my game, shut down my PC, and got ready for a good night's sleep.\n\nI came in to work Thursday, having ennjoyed my day off. The radio buzzing about some economic thing in Venezuela in the background. I made sure my dad wasn't there before surreptitiously turning the dial to KRUD, the local pop station. I'll admit, it mostly plays trash, but without it, I'd have 99 problems, and they'd all be country stations. I clocked in and started taking inventory for that morning while a man I only know as \"Stringy\" swept the front. We're *technically* a Home Depot, but in truth we're a mom and pop operation. Our store's been in the family since '55, named \"The Home Depot,\" but when Home Depot rolled in, they decided it'd be cheaper to just work out a franchise deal to own the name and keep it solvent in exchange for a cut, rather than try and sue and earn the hatred of the state of Alabama.\n\nEverything was quiet as usual, not a lot of people buying hardware at 8 AM on a Tuesday, until Stringy scuttled into the back room and tried to speak. I'll never understand why my dad hired him at a store. He works hard, but everything he says requires subtitles, like he's an ancillary person on some cheap, exploitative TLC show.\n\n\"Johnny, y'g't'see-man, they's got these Mess-cans, black shades, suits, comin' l'k'n' you up, mang, you gah see. Bet they cartels, mang.\"\n\nI cocked my head for a moment, before figuring out what he said. I was pretty confused, but headed to the front counter. When I reached there, I gave the standard greeting of \"Welcome to Home Depot, how can I help you?\"\n\nOne of the three men, all of whom were indeed wearing suits and black sunglasses, spoke with a strong but measured South American accent.\n\n\"Are you 'Weezlboy101?'\"\n\n\"Uh...\" I stalled, trying to figure out exactly how much trouble I was in. The man removed his shades and pulled out a smartphone, opening it to a screenshot of me from the earlier night's stream.\n\n\"Is this you?\" He demanded, somewhat more urgently. It was clear that he meant business. I spotted a holstered gun beneath his jacket, just barely visible, and came closer to ruining my pants than I'd care to admit.\n\n\"Uh, yes?\"\n\n\"Good. I represent the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and I have been asked to see to it that you continue streaming your video games. We will pay handsomely for it.\" He produced a badge and identification for me to look at for a moment before stowing it.\n\nStringy choked on his coffee, and I would have too had I been drinking any. I tread carefully, silently and cautiously placing my hand next to the panic button beneath the counter.\n\n\"As you probably know, you have recently experienced a sizable increase in viewership,\" he began. This was true, actually, as I'd experienced an unprecedented boom out of nowhere. I somehow went from 10,000 subscriptions last year to nearly 5 *million* this year. \"What you may not realize,\" he continued, \"is that most of your viewers are Venezuelan. Your viewers make up 15% of our nation's population.\"\n\nI didn't say anything. I just kinda stood there glassy-eyed as the man paused and waited for me to acknowledge. After an uncomfortable pause, he continued.\n\n\"Your decision to reduce streaming, has led to a, how do you say it,\" he trailed off for a moment before Stringy leaned in and responded, \"Eck-nomic downt'rn?\"\n\nEveryone, myself included, paused to look at Stringy for a moment, not expecting his sudden eloquence.\n\n\"Yes, an 'economic downturn.'\"\n\nI stepped back and looked at the men for a moment. I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was just, the *dumbest* thing I had ever heard in my life. After another minute of silence, I spoke.\n\n\"Am I being Punk'd?\" \n\n\"Excuse me, what is, 'Punk'd'?\" the man said. One of his compatriots clear his throat, and said, something in Spanish. I'm not quite fluent, but it was something to the effect of, \"A show where an American man-child plays jokes upon rich people.\"\n\n\"No, you are not being, 'Punk'd'.\" He handed me an official-looking letter, signed by a 'Presidente Nicol\u00e1s Maduro'.\n\nI silently stepped back toward the counter, looking more closely at the letter while hitting the panic button. I didn't know what was going on, but at this point, it's better safe than sorry. I didn't think they'd notice, but they must have spotted the move, as they immediately tackled me, picked me up, and carried me screaming into a van they had parked outside.

I got a job at home depot in alabama just to make some money while i transitioned into the new home. \n\nThe money wasn't anything great but the work wasn't anything to difficult and after my last job it was definitely a step up. So my job has me basically stocking shelves  and taking inventory, and putting in orders for items. Nothing to special right?\n\nWell my trainer was an alcoholic and he definitely just wanted to be done with the job so he showed me any shortcuts possible. Anything to get on that smoke/drink break right?\n\nAnyway my first day doing it myself came up and it went pretty smoothly. Nails on top, screws on bottom shelf, drills in the middle. 1,2,3, was how he taught me. \n\nI stocked shelves like this for the last two years and i come in today to see that the store is closed for renovation. With no heads up from our boss. \n\nNow my boss was an alcoholic(kinda goes with the job honestly) so when i saw him growing increasingly anxious throughout the years i didn't think much of it. \n\nHe called me in and we had the following conversation (for the story we'll call him pepe sylvia [or just pepe])\n\nPep: We're all in deep shit here man, oh god this is bad.\n\n*everything he said, was between sips from a flask that had jim dean in it, he wasn't even a good drinker, belching and doing those misty sneezes everytime he drank, just a real fucking mess*\n\nMe: What's up?\n\nPepe: Delta, Glomach, and Trabajo all pulled. They said we haven't been selling enough of their products. That's a 35% drop in profits over the last two years. \n\nMe:The nails?\n\nPepe: Yeah, the fucking nails. What's worse is i can't even find them to take inventory. Yet sales reports show their being sold no problem. I DON'T FUCKING GET IT!!!\n\nHe slams some stuff on the desk. He flips a chalkboard over and it's covered in paperwork. Picture's of peoples faces, yarn tacked up connecting different papers together, phone numbers, pictures of crates of guns in warehouses, a fucking map? I'd never seen anything like this, but it was pretty obvious what happened. \n\nMy boss was losing his goddamn mind. On the map all the yarn and trails lead to two places. At the top in arizona was my boss pepe, and at the other end was a small village in venezuela. Here in america all the yarn was green, and as the trails led back across the world and eventually to europe, the colors changed to yellow at the end of each string. \n\nPepe: Look, i.. uh, you need to go home and not worry about this, don't worry you'll be paid the next few days, but we gotta shut down so i can sort this out.\n\nMe: Well, look if there's anythi-\n\nPepe: Just go. This is my problem anyway.\n\n\nSo I went home and tried to forget whatever the hell happened when it finally came on the nightly news. Apparently the top shelf was supposed to be for discounted drills and tools to be taken to the other side and sold at rebate. The rebate section had a picture of what looked to just be a decorative map in behind where all the tools and stuff sat.\n\nThe bottom shelf was also color coded for some of my bosses friends. It was some way for the local cartel to tell when and where to ship guns and coke, and what days certain coastguards would and wouldn't be working. \n\nI had been screwing with the whole operation by following my halfassed trainers instructions and people were getting arrested everyday because of it. \n\nI have no clue what the link is, but ATF wants to ask if i know of my boss having connections to any Venezuelan gangs, and the italian mob running a transcontinental prostitution ring, with ties to child soldiers in venezuela. \n\nSomehow apl this is linked, but they told me the good news is, that it all comes back to the supplier in venezuela and their economy is really the only thing taking a hit.\n\nTl;dr I'm a regular guy who works at a home depot in alabama and for the last two year's i have been unknowingly destroying the venezuelan government. \n\nDoesn't make sense to me, but this is honest to god the whole story.\n\n[Heres some Proof for those who don't believe me](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-01/venezuelas-currency-value-depends-largely-one-guy-alabama-home-depot)"], [5, "Interview Commences.\n\nInterviewer: Could you give us some background on this?\n\nInterviewee: At first I couldn\u2019t understand the charges.

Actually, he'd had time to write better-than-the-library replacements for several key functions. \"Oh, what about it, did you find an issue?\"\n\n\"Not as such,\" Dawes opened the lid of the bound report in front of him and glanced down, \"Did you know that we started receiving 1.6 million more hits per day exactly 3 weeks after deploying the new payment system?\" \n\nJames scowled, confused. \"How can changing the payment back-end affect traffic?\"\n\n\"Indeed, that's a good question.

Lots of heavy lifting and a load of people all up on my ass in case something goes wrong or if they can't get their light bulb pulled out of their ass.\n\nSo, how do these things go together?\n\nApparently, according to the FBI agent that has my balls strapped to this chair here, I have been pinched as an accidental accomplice in the biggest black market scheme in the history of the Americas.\n\nSo, let's start from the beginning. \n\nMobile is a big place and we get a lot of people of all walks of life, and so comes this dude name Hugo who says he's from Caracas. Hugo's cool, talks shit with me, asks about the Saints and goes by his way. He used to give me these notes he would say are Bolivars, but not being able to accept those just in case my boss thought it was monopoly money, I told him to hit up a currency exchange out in Pensacola by their airport, and with a little google-fu, found out he should get a dime for every Bolivar. He thanks me and bounces.\n\nNext week, he comes again. Same monopoly money. Said the currency exchange told him to fuck off. I sigh, and me being a nice guy, start fronting him. I grab each one to the currency exchange and let him buy...well whatever the hell he was buying.\n\nWood. Nails. Knives. Power tools. More and more shit every day. I had to ask one day what kind of project he was doing, and he just said it was stuff for a home he was making. I don't take much else note on it and kept doing this little exchange we got going.\n\nWe-e-e-ellll. It turns out he wasn't building a home. He was selling that shit back to his home country by flying back to Caracas every weekend and sending that shit by freighter and then selling them at upkeep. Basically for ever 10 cents I gave him, he sold it for 30c on the dollar and that isn't good when you become the supplier for an international black market ring and it's all caught on surveillance camera.\n\nNow. Agent Leon, seeing as I'm an unwitting participant, will you let me go because time is money man and the dude wanted to build a yacht. I don't know what for, but he did say he wanted to know where the nearest gun store was too, and y'know, I kinda want to make that money. I got employee of the month last month from his glowing reviews!"]], [[{"comment": "\n**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n", "id": "dapjyx1"}], [{"comment": "Works been strange lately. Wasn't always this way. Used to throw on my orange apron, walk up and down these aisles, restock some boxes of screws or paint brushes, get chewed out by my supervisor, and maybe help a customer or two. It was boring but I liked it that way.\n\nBut lately, something strange has been happening. As I do my work, a crowd follows me, watching everything I do and taking notes. First, it started with this one fellow. Now, I'm a pretty open minded guy - race doesn't matter a lick to me - but you don't see many hispanic guys named Angel in Hoover, Alabama. So he stuck out at first. Angel would follow me around the store with his phone out, taking pics and tweeting what I was doing. I thought it was strange, but he wasn't bothering me none so I didn't mind. Hell, maybe I'll go viral and get flown out to see Ellen. Karen (my wife) would like that.\n\nAfter about a week, another person started following me as well - Maria. Then a few days later, another. Then another. Before I knew it, I had a crowd of ten or so Hispanic people, following me around work. It was bewildering! My supervisor (who didn't like me much to begin with) got mad and started yelling at me, like it was somehow my fault that I had a posse trailing me around the store. First, my supervisor tried kicking them out of the store, but that didn't work. They kept sneaking back in. Then he tried calling the police on them. That worked for a day or two, but then they came back in. My supervisor got the police chief on the phone to ask 'What the hell!?' but the police chief said that this goes up. *Way up*. Something about a senator and 'regime destabilization.' \n\nSo now, that's where I'm at. I have my fan club, which is what I like to call them, following me around work everyday. They do their best to not get in the way, and sometimes even pitch in a hand if I'm restocking or cleaning something up. I once asked them what they were doing and they said something about being freedom fighters and something else about South American black markets. I'm not one for economics and politics, so I nodded my head genially and went back to price labeling our  outdoor furniture collection. \n\nI don't why me or why Home Depot.

It's obviously not a strict universal classifier. This is more \"If I **had** to put money on whether he's conservative or liberal, this is why I would bet Conservative\".\n\nFirst, Hoover, Alabama. Alabama has been traditionally conservative, and Hoover isn't a major city to my knowledge. I could be wrong and I could look it up, but I want to answer this with strictly the information I already have based on the story.\n\nSecond, \"Hispanic\". I grew up in San Diego and the SF Bay Area, and I went to college in the Central Valley of California. Basically, I've been around Mexican people most of my life and I only ever hear \"Hispanic\" when spoken in the context of professional/academic speaking or with people who don't actually interact with Hispanic people all that much. Building on this, in my own personal experience, places that don't have much of a Hispanic population and aren't border towns tend to be more conservative, e.g. Orange County.\n\nThird, \"I'm not one for economics and politics\". Again, generalizing, but in my experience I've seen that people who lean liberal are more likely to be more interested in foreign politics and people who lean conservative are more likely to be more interested in domestic and local politics, with according disinterest on either side.\n\nFinally, beyond concrete reasons, his personality and demeanor sound like a good amount of people I've met, especially when I was visiting Oklahoma. The way he speaks, thinks, and lives his life is very similar with the people I came across there, and those people I know are conservative, hence why I draw the parallels to his political leanings.\n\nAs a side note, it was fun being an Asian guy in rural Oklahoma.

He always hated these times, waking up at 11 at night, to work until 6 the next morning, going home to his girlfriend, and trying to get as much sleep as possible. His income was barely above minimum wage, and he always struggled to curb his drug addiction. The store felt like it was draining his soul and he wanted out.\n\n\nExcept two months ago, he began to notice weird things. The same customer, who went by Eduardo, would come in with a well-trimmed suit each week and ask for his advice on whatever. Lately, that advice had been solely about economics. How much should x cost compared to y? How much x should be produced a month? Derrick didn't know anything about economics, so it was mostly shrugs at first, but at the months went on, Derrick started giving him phony answers just so he could leave him alone. Then checks started coming in his mail. The checks came from a Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (whoever that was), and every week he would get them for the same amount. Not enough to make him rich or anything, but enough to pay the rent.\n\n\nDerrick opened the front door and clocked in. He went to the cashier stand, and just sat there waiting for customers. Surprisingly, Home Depot was actually busy this time of day; more than a few night owls would be perusing the shelves looking for whatever they needed. A few minutes into his shift, he saw a man in a suit walk in. Instead of Eduardo, though, it was a middle-aged man of about 55 who came straight to Derrick.\n\n\n\"Are you Derrick Manuel?\"\n\n\n\"Uhh, yeah. How can I help you tonight?\" Derrick really was tired, being up at an ungodly hour. He tried his best to smile like he was payed to do.\n\n\n\"I'm Michael Stevens, and I'm with the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions regarding this man. Have you ever seen him?\"\n\n\nStevens pulled out a photo of Eduardo, only everything about it seemed strange. Eduardo was in a military uniform, wearing a general's beret and holding a cigar in his hand, standing beside five or ten men in similar uniforms and helmets. Derrick didn't know how to react. There's no way that could be Eduardo.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, what? Why are you showing me this?\"\n\n\n\"May I remind you that it's illegal to interfere in an investigation? Have you seen this man?\"\n\n\n\"Maybe, I don't know? We get a lot of customers.\" Derrick couldn't believe what was coming out of his mouth. Did he just lie to the FBI? This couldn't go down well anymore. Should he confess? *No, that would just make me a suspect. Damn it, I'm in too deep.*\n\n\n\"Okay, let me show you another picture.\" Stevens puts his hand in his suit and produces another photo, this time of Eduardo in the Home Depot talking with Derrick at the register.\n\n\n\"Yeah, like I said, we have a lot of customers.\" *Oh crap*\n\n\n\"Could you tell me then why you--\"\n\n\n\"Stevens!\" A younger agent comes walking speedily, and whispers in Stevens' ear. They then go a few paces away, and start conversing. Derrick felt nervous. *Should I ask them. Am I in trouble? Sh***t, I'm in trouble aren't I?*\n\n\nStevens turns around and calmly says \"We have no further questions, thank you for your time.\"\n\n\nDerrick didn't know what to make of it. He finished the shift and few hours later, but couldn't get the experience out of his mind. When he got back to his apartment, he found his girlfriend asleep, and opened his laptop to check his e-mails. He found one new e-mail in his inbox, timestamped at about half an hour after the conversation, reading \"Good job not blowing our cover.

How would he explain this to his girlfriend? How would he explain this to his mom? How would he even explain it to himself? He kept asking questions, and felt the weight of a ton of bricks on his back, wondering how he could make sense of it all. Why did Eduardo choose him? Why did he ask so many questions straight from what he'd assume to be an economics quiz?\n\nHe decided to check his mail, since after all this would be the day when a check would be sent in. He quickly changed into a clean set of clothes and went downstairs to the P.O. Box he had. Sure enough, he pulled out an envelope, and went back upstairs before anyone could suspect. His hands were visibly shaking as he held what he assumed to be the check, and when he got back into his room, he tore the envelope open. Same as always, a check for $300 dollars, a little less than half the rent but helpful nonetheless. He almost put on his jacket to head to the bank, when he received a text message on his phone. \n\n\"Im at work early\n\nHad 2 get up b4 u got back\n\n<3 u\n\nMartha\"\n\nMartha and he both had jobs to pay the rent, of course. She worked at a local diner, and as far as he knew would work an 8 hour shift today. That was assuming her usual start time at 9; maybe someone called in sick? He didn't know how to handle this information, but knew that the relationship would be in trouble if he didn't share. Martha was the only one who knew about his drug addiction, and keeping secrets would make her suspect that he wasn't clean. So much for staying off of it for six years, if all that goes down the drain because of some mysterious figure.\n\nHe spent the time catching up on sleep, when his alarm woke him up at 1 PM. Bernard St. was about 20 minutes away from his apartment by car, but his car was low on gas. This on top of heading to the bank to cash the check *I could probably do it after the thing. Its not like I'm broke right now.* He checked his bank account online, and when he confirmed he'd have enough to pay for gas he put on his jacket and headed out.\n\nWhen he reached Bernard St., it was about 1:45. *Great, 20 minutes early. What should I do now?* He decided his best bet would be to wait it out. Thankfully, as far as back alleys go, Bernard St. was of the cleaner variety, in the sense that it wasn't a hot spot for drug deals or gang meet ups or anything like that. That's what he had learned on the streets as a teen, and as he was getting lost in his thoughts, he noticed a man in a suit walk into the alley. Derrick checked his phone, and sure enough, it was 2:06, about a minute off his time. The man pulled a gun on Derrick and asked for his name.\n\n\"Derrick Manuel.\"\n\n\"Come with me.\"\n\nDerrick took a deep breath before he started following him. He knew that it was a bad idea to disobey an armed man, especially if he asked him to come and already knew his e-mail. The man turned the corner and walked for another few paces, before stopping after a five minute walk. *This is the alleyway between Baker and McCart St. I should probably remember that.*\n\nThe man opened the door and told Derrick to wait outside. After ten minutes of wondering why they went through the trouble to bring him here, the man opened the door and said \"Eduardo will see you now.\"\n\n\"Eduardo! Does he know the crap that was just pulled on me! What the hell does he want!\"\n\nDerrick stepped into the house and noticed how unusually ornate the interior was. The furniture had a Victorian era quality to them, and a chandelier hung above the main lobby. Enwrapping the lobby was a double staircase leading to a balcony on the second floor. On the second floor stood Eduardo, only this time in the general's uniform he saw in the FBI photo. Eduardo's eyes caught Derrick, and he began to smile as if greeting an old friend.\n\n\"Derrick! Its so good for you to come. I hope Fernando treated you well?\"\n\n\"Uhh, yeah, sure. Why am I here?\"\n\n\"In good time, in good time. First, sit down, have a drink! Lets catch up!\"\n\nEduardo clapped his hands a couple times, and a servant walked up with a tray of rum. She poured a couple glasses before leaving the bottle and exiting through the same door she came in. Eduardo strolled down the stairs, and greeted Derrick with a strong handshake before sitting down in a fur chair. Derrick took the couch that sat at a 90 degree angle, and politely took a sip of the rum before setting it down. Strangely, he never acquired the taste for alcoholic beverages, and struggled to drink the one sip he chose to take. Eduardo took a sip of his own before beginning.\n\n\"Derrick, we trust you more than any agent we've ever had. Your advice has greatly benefitted our country, and we humbly thank you for your service.\"\n\nDerrick sat there bewildered by the last part, and mumbled a thank you under his breath as he forced another sip. Eduardo continued\n\n\"Because of the recent leak of information, we'll be sending other agents at various times throughout the next weeks to avoid an information leak. Ever since you left prison, its been easier to track you down and coordinate with the others.\"\n\nDerrick did a mental double-take. Coordinate with who?\n\n\"But every so often, we'll bring you here to test your loyalty to us. We cannot fully explain how grateful we are for what you did early this morning.\"\n\nDerrick sat there about to ask so many questions, when Fernando (*I guess that's his name*) came up and escorted him back out. He said goodbye to Eduardo, before heading back to his car. As he drove toward the bank to cash his check, he couldn't believe what was happening in his life.\n\n******\n\nThank y'all so much for the responses and for the gold.

Like, explosions are supposed to be big, bright and *powerful,* you know? But behind the table, I felt absolutely nothing, no concussion wave no bright flash. Just a hiss.\n\nI turned towards Ed to ask him something but put a finger to his lips when I turned to look at him, and pulled out a freaking pistol from his jeans. \n\nWhat the hell?\n\nEd seemed like a normal enough guy, his skin was an olive color, he was average height, dark eyes, short hair\u2026that\u2019s it. Not the kind of guy you would expect to carry a gun. \n\nThat\u2019s when I heard the door of the front entrance opening, and soft, muffled footsteps. I moved to peek over at who was coming but Eduardo yanked me back, and I gave a little yelp. Immediately, a serious of thuds wnt through my head that was leaning against the table.\n\nSomeone had just tried to shoot me.\n\nEduardo immediately got up and shot towards the door. Where the person who had fired at us made no noise, Eduardo\u2019s gun was *loud,* very loud. He shot 4 times, pausing momentarily after each shot as I lay behind the table covering my ears. \nEduardo quickly tapped my shoulder and motioned for me to get up.

Ed bent over and took the weapon from the corpse which I tried not to look at too hard. \u201cSilenced,\u201d Ed muttered almost to himself, \u201cidiots.\u201d  \n\nIn spite my terror I managed, \u201cIdiots? Why?\u201d \n\nEd gave me an annoyed glance as we continued out of the Home Depot, and off handedly said, \u201csub sonic bullets, that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t go through the wood and kill us because of your idiocy.\u201d\n\nTaken aback at how close I\u2019d come to death.

She'd only been in Alabama for six months but she couldn't stand the humidity, the heat, and \u2014 worst of all \u2014 the men. She had heard that there was a certain machismo that emanated from Southern men, but she never realized just how often they had to prove their worth.\n\nSheila herself was born and raised a few towns away from Asbury Park by the beach. Her father was a Polish immigrant and her mother was from a small village in Venezuela called Trujillo. She had been raised back and forth between all three countries, and her father was very generous with the locals in her mother's home town. \"Always give back,\" her father would say, \"because you never know who you're going to be relying on later.\" Those words echoed today of all days, as she came to the realization that today was exactly six months since they moved out to Alabama since her mother's death.\n\nBack at the register, Sheila scanned various customers' items, not thinking much of who she was attending to or what she was scanning. \"Thanks for shopping at Home Depot,\" she muttered robotically, \"Would you like your receipt?\" And the day drilled on, customer after customer, the occasional complaint here and there, and sometimes someone's smile was enough to get her out of her funk momentarily, but never quite enough to pull her out of it for longer than a flash.\n\nYet another customer strolled to her line with a ticket for a larger item they kept outside. Something about her struck her as odd\u2026 familiar, even. The woman was definitely middle aged, if not tiptoeing graciously into her early 50s. Her blood orange shawl wrapped around her neck like a rooster's wattle, and her thick aviators covered nearly half of her slim face.\n\n\"I can have someone help you bring this into your car, ma'am,\" she sighed to the woman, making eye contact as well as she could from behind her sunglasses.\n\n\"\u00bfY a m\u00ed no me *podr\u00edah* ayudar t\u00fa *mihma*?\"^1 the woman asked briskly in a very marked Venezuelan accent. ^(1 And you can't help me yourself?)\n\n\"\u00bfC-c\u00f3mo?\"^2 Sheila wasn't used to anyone speaking in Spanish to her here. After all, her father was from Poland, and he effectively whitewashed her skin tone with his Eastern European genes.

Papa Weezl needs yours truly to take some more hours at the store, so I'm gonna be streaming once a week now on, instead of bi-weekly. I gotta do my part, since his arthritis is acting up. I still love you guys, though, and I'll see you next Tuesday. Weezlboy signing out!\"\n\nWith that, I pressed F7 to cut the stream, closed out of my game, shut down my PC, and got ready for a good night's sleep.\n\nI came in to work Thursday, having ennjoyed my day off. The radio buzzing about some economic thing in Venezuela in the background. I made sure my dad wasn't there before surreptitiously turning the dial to KRUD, the local pop station. I'll admit, it mostly plays trash, but without it, I'd have 99 problems, and they'd all be country stations. I clocked in and started taking inventory for that morning while a man I only know as \"Stringy\" swept the front. We're *technically* a Home Depot, but in truth we're a mom and pop operation. Our store's been in the family since '55, named \"The Home Depot,\" but when Home Depot rolled in, they decided it'd be cheaper to just work out a franchise deal to own the name and keep it solvent in exchange for a cut, rather than try and sue and earn the hatred of the state of Alabama.\n\nEverything was quiet as usual, not a lot of people buying hardware at 8 AM on a Tuesday, until Stringy scuttled into the back room and tried to speak. I'll never understand why my dad hired him at a store. He works hard, but everything he says requires subtitles, like he's an ancillary person on some cheap, exploitative TLC show.\n\n\"Johnny, y'g't'see-man, they's got these Mess-cans, black shades, suits, comin' l'k'n' you up, mang, you gah see. Bet they cartels, mang.\"\n\nI cocked my head for a moment, before figuring out what he said. I was pretty confused, but headed to the front counter. When I reached there, I gave the standard greeting of \"Welcome to Home Depot, how can I help you?\"\n\nOne of the three men, all of whom were indeed wearing suits and black sunglasses, spoke with a strong but measured South American accent.\n\n\"Are you 'Weezlboy101?'\"\n\n\"Uh...\" I stalled, trying to figure out exactly how much trouble I was in. The man removed his shades and pulled out a smartphone, opening it to a screenshot of me from the earlier night's stream.\n\n\"Is this you?\" He demanded, somewhat more urgently. It was clear that he meant business. I spotted a holstered gun beneath his jacket, just barely visible, and came closer to ruining my pants than I'd care to admit.\n\n\"Uh, yes?\"\n\n\"Good. I represent the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and I have been asked to see to it that you continue streaming your video games. We will pay handsomely for it.\" He produced a badge and identification for me to look at for a moment before stowing it.\n\nStringy choked on his coffee, and I would have too had I been drinking any. I tread carefully, silently and cautiously placing my hand next to the panic button beneath the counter.\n\n\"As you probably know, you have recently experienced a sizable increase in viewership,\" he began. This was true, actually, as I'd experienced an unprecedented boom out of nowhere. I somehow went from 10,000 subscriptions last year to nearly 5 *million* this year. \"What you may not realize,\" he continued, \"is that most of your viewers are Venezuelan. Your viewers make up 15% of our nation's population.\"\n\nI didn't say anything. I just kinda stood there glassy-eyed as the man paused and waited for me to acknowledge. After an uncomfortable pause, he continued.\n\n\"Your decision to reduce streaming, has led to a, how do you say it,\" he trailed off for a moment before Stringy leaned in and responded, \"Eck-nomic downt'rn?\"\n\nEveryone, myself included, paused to look at Stringy for a moment, not expecting his sudden eloquence.\n\n\"Yes, an 'economic downturn.'\"\n\nI stepped back and looked at the men for a moment. I just couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was just, the *dumbest* thing I had ever heard in my life. After another minute of silence, I spoke.\n\n\"Am I being Punk'd?\" \n\n\"Excuse me, what is, 'Punk'd'?\" the man said. One of his compatriots clear his throat, and said, something in Spanish. I'm not quite fluent, but it was something to the effect of, \"A show where an American man-child plays jokes upon rich people.\"\n\n\"No, you are not being, 'Punk'd'.\" He handed me an official-looking letter, signed by a 'Presidente Nicol\u00e1s Maduro'.\n\nI silently stepped back toward the counter, looking more closely at the letter while hitting the panic button. I didn't know what was going on, but at this point, it's better safe than sorry. I didn't think they'd notice, but they must have spotted the move, as they immediately tackled me, picked me up, and carried me screaming into a van they had parked outside.

I got a job at home depot in alabama just to make some money while i transitioned into the new home. \n\nThe money wasn't anything great but the work wasn't anything to difficult and after my last job it was definitely a step up. So my job has me basically stocking shelves  and taking inventory, and putting in orders for items. Nothing to special right?\n\nWell my trainer was an alcoholic and he definitely just wanted to be done with the job so he showed me any shortcuts possible. Anything to get on that smoke/drink break right?\n\nAnyway my first day doing it myself came up and it went pretty smoothly. Nails on top, screws on bottom shelf, drills in the middle. 1,2,3, was how he taught me. \n\nI stocked shelves like this for the last two years and i come in today to see that the store is closed for renovation. With no heads up from our boss. \n\nNow my boss was an alcoholic(kinda goes with the job honestly) so when i saw him growing increasingly anxious throughout the years i didn't think much of it. \n\nHe called me in and we had the following conversation (for the story we'll call him pepe sylvia [or just pepe])\n\nPep: We're all in deep shit here man, oh god this is bad.\n\n*everything he said, was between sips from a flask that had jim dean in it, he wasn't even a good drinker, belching and doing those misty sneezes everytime he drank, just a real fucking mess*\n\nMe: What's up?\n\nPepe: Delta, Glomach, and Trabajo all pulled. They said we haven't been selling enough of their products. That's a 35% drop in profits over the last two years. \n\nMe:The nails?\n\nPepe: Yeah, the fucking nails. What's worse is i can't even find them to take inventory. Yet sales reports show their being sold no problem. I DON'T FUCKING GET IT!!!\n\nHe slams some stuff on the desk. He flips a chalkboard over and it's covered in paperwork. Picture's of peoples faces, yarn tacked up connecting different papers together, phone numbers, pictures of crates of guns in warehouses, a fucking map? I'd never seen anything like this, but it was pretty obvious what happened. \n\nMy boss was losing his goddamn mind. On the map all the yarn and trails lead to two places. At the top in arizona was my boss pepe, and at the other end was a small village in venezuela. Here in america all the yarn was green, and as the trails led back across the world and eventually to europe, the colors changed to yellow at the end of each string. \n\nPepe: Look, i.. uh, you need to go home and not worry about this, don't worry you'll be paid the next few days, but we gotta shut down so i can sort this out.\n\nMe: Well, look if there's anythi-\n\nPepe: Just go. This is my problem anyway.\n\n\nSo I went home and tried to forget whatever the hell happened when it finally came on the nightly news. Apparently the top shelf was supposed to be for discounted drills and tools to be taken to the other side and sold at rebate. The rebate section had a picture of what looked to just be a decorative map in behind where all the tools and stuff sat.\n\nThe bottom shelf was also color coded for some of my bosses friends. It was some way for the local cartel to tell when and where to ship guns and coke, and what days certain coastguards would and wouldn't be working. \n\nI had been screwing with the whole operation by following my halfassed trainers instructions and people were getting arrested everyday because of it. \n\nI have no clue what the link is, but ATF wants to ask if i know of my boss having connections to any Venezuelan gangs, and the italian mob running a transcontinental prostitution ring, with ties to child soldiers in venezuela. \n\nSomehow apl this is linked, but they told me the good news is, that it all comes back to the supplier in venezuela and their economy is really the only thing taking a hit.\n\nTl;dr I'm a regular guy who works at a home depot in alabama and for the last two year's i have been unknowingly destroying the venezuelan government. \n\nDoesn't make sense to me, but this is honest to god the whole story.\n\n[Heres some Proof for those who don't believe me](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-01/venezuelas-currency-value-depends-largely-one-guy-alabama-home-depot)", "id": "daq1h26"}], [{"comment": "Interview Commences.\n\nInterviewer: Could you give us some background on this?\n\nInterviewee: At first I couldn\u2019t understand the charges.

Determine extent and nature of infestation and exterminate.**\n\nSighing heavily, I marched out of the office and made way for the nearest mag-lev transporter. There goes my free evening, I thought gloomily. Ever since the addition of the new Arizona Module to the starboard side of the *New America*, I had been swamped with work. And it's not interesting work, either; I would've liked a free pass to go see the new Module, even if it was on duty. But as always. the senior workers get first picks, and I was stuck with regular maintenance duties - just a lot more of it. \n\nI climbed aboard a waiting train car and sank into a window-side seat. Soon, the mag-lev began to zoom effortlessly down the track, heading for the butt end of the ship. I gazed out the \"city\" below - thousands of men and women milled about, chatting with each other, getting to work, or eating dinner at restaurants. I left Earth only three months ago, and some days I almost forget that I was space-side - but a quick look out a main hull window remedied that. I sighed again and glanced at my toolkit, lying on the seat next to me. To be honest, the work's not so bad, usually. Because I was so new, I did most of the lowly grunt work - washing or scrubbing or vacuuming - while some of my colleagues got to work on the hull, electrical maintenance, and the like. But there was no doubt in anyone's mind that pest control was by far the worst the task we had to perform.\n\nIt was a completely unforeseen problem; after all, we were in space! We lived in a giant, jigsaw-puzzle amalgamation of metal and glass that orbited the Earth. We had to be constantly vigilant of things like micrometeorites and solar flares, things that could kill everyone in the whole damn space station if we weren't keeping our nose on the job at all times. But pests? That's an Earth-side issue! Well, it should be, anyway. Turns out, some tiny bugs stowed away on with the people that moved here, or with the second wave of arrivals, or the third, or so on. And damn, they are resilient; space radiation, alternating freezing and boiling, and particle bombardment be damned. They survived, they thrived, and in the past three decades this station has been running, they've diversified. My buddy, who's a biologist on this tank, constantly tells me that it's astounding how quickly speciation has occurred. I tell him that he needs to hurry up and figure out a better way to exterminate these suckers.\n\nThe train slid into a station and a garbled computer voiced reminded us to watch our step as we got off. I hoisted my pack and made my way toward the Section 12 - that is, the auxiliary engine bay. The facility was cordoned off to the general public, but a quick flash from my badge and the computer granted me access. After checking my instructions again, I climbed in through a little hobbit hole and gazed around at the seemingly endless vista of metal, wires, and blinking lights. \n\n\"Alright, let's this over with,\" I murmured. I put on the heavy-grade extermination suit hanging by a hook on a nearby wall - it was at least a size too big for me - and activated the usual sensors. Ultra-sensitive seismic motion detection, infrared vision, atmospheric capacitors. I also equipped a sort of flamethrower - most of the equipment in here was extremely heat-resistant, and so a controlled beam of fire was determined to be the best tool. \n\nAll this technology just to kill a few bugs.\n\n\"Yech,\" I muttered. There was one hiding right behind the a tank of pressurized gas, and I quickly stepped in front. It was as disgusting as you might expect; imagine a cockroach with beady, black eyes, wavering brownish antennas and a shining, brown carapace. Oh, and it's also the the size of a small cat.

Determine extent and nature of infestation and exterminate.**\n\nSighing heavily, I marched out of the office and made way for the nearest mag-lev transporter. There goes my free evening, I thought gloomily. Ever since the addition of the new Arizona Module to the starboard side of the *New America*, I had been swamped with work. And it's not interesting work, either; I would've liked a free pass to go see the new Module, even if it was on duty. But as always. the senior workers get first picks, and I was stuck with regular maintenance duties - just a lot more of it. \n\nI climbed aboard a waiting train car and sank into a window-side seat. Soon, the mag-lev began to zoom effortlessly down the track, heading for the butt end of the ship. I gazed out the \"city\" below - thousands of men and women milled about, chatting with each other, getting to work, or eating dinner at restaurants. I left Earth only three months ago, and some days I almost forget that I was space-side - but a quick look out a main hull window remedied that. I sighed again and glanced at my toolkit, lying on the seat next to me. To be honest, the work's not so bad, usually. Because I was so new, I did most of the lowly grunt work - washing or scrubbing or vacuuming - while some of my colleagues got to work on the hull, electrical maintenance, and the like. But there was no doubt in anyone's mind that pest control was by far the worst the task we had to perform.\n\nIt was a completely unforeseen problem; after all, we were in space! We lived in a giant, jigsaw-puzzle amalgamation of metal and glass that orbited the Earth. We had to be constantly vigilant of things like micrometeorites and solar flares, things that could kill everyone in the whole damn space station if we weren't keeping our nose on the job at all times. But pests? That's an Earth-side issue! Well, it should be, anyway. Turns out, some tiny bugs stowed away on with the people that moved here, or with the second wave of arrivals, or the third, or so on. And damn, they are resilient; space radiation, alternating freezing and boiling, and particle bombardment be damned. They survived, they thrived, and in the past three decades this station has been running, they've diversified. My buddy, who's a biologist on this tank, constantly tells me that it's astounding how quickly speciation has occurred. I tell him that he needs to hurry up and figure out a better way to exterminate these suckers.\n\nThe train slid into a station and a garbled computer voiced reminded us to watch our step as we got off. I hoisted my pack and made my way toward the Section 12 - that is, the auxiliary engine bay. The facility was cordoned off to the general public, but a quick flash from my badge and the computer granted me access. After checking my instructions again, I climbed in through a little hobbit hole and gazed around at the seemingly endless vista of metal, wires, and blinking lights. \n\n\"Alright, let's this over with,\" I murmured. I put on the heavy-grade extermination suit hanging by a hook on a nearby wall - it was at least a size too big for me - and activated the usual sensors. Ultra-sensitive seismic motion detection, infrared vision, atmospheric capacitors. I also equipped a sort of flamethrower - most of the equipment in here was extremely heat-resistant, and so a controlled beam of fire was determined to be the best tool. \n\nAll this technology just to kill a few bugs.\n\n\"Yech,\" I muttered. There was one hiding right behind the a tank of pressurized gas, and I quickly stepped in front. It was as disgusting as you might expect; imagine a cockroach with beady, black eyes, wavering brownish antennas and a shining, brown carapace. Oh, and it's also the the size of a small cat. I turned on the flame and watched it twist and burn with grim satisfaction.\n\nAn hour passed, and it seemed like my job would never be over. Where the hell were all these blasted bugs coming from?

I'm definitely sufficient enough to destroy the planet. And look at how many fans I have.\"\n\nFire looked down upon the Earth, dismayed by the sheer number of people that thought destruction ice would be \"great\". Every day, the people of the planet gathered to watch Fire and Ice's arguments, and wonder if this would finally be the day that one of the entities did them in. The uniform on Earth had been reduced to two possible garments: a red T shirt and pair of athletic shorts with \"Team Fire\" emblazoned across the chest, and a light blue T shirt/athletic short combo that read \"Team Ice\". Their numbers were almost exactly equal.\n\n\"How about this,\" Ice said, once Fire had calmed down a bit. \"We'll go down to Earth and put it to a vote among the people. Whoever wins gets to destroy the planet.\"\n\n\"We've already tried that, twice,\" Fire said, \"The votes came out exactly 50/50.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're right...\" Ice thought for a second. \"You know, the idea of destroying the planet is fun and all, but I really miss my wife and kids.

She had two text messages; one from the government and one from Brittany.\n\nThe government's text was automated, and came at the same time as it had every day before. Today, Rachel was on \"Team Fire.\" She rolled out of bed and picked one of her five red T shirts and a pair of red shorts. \n\nThe uniform had been a bit upsetting when it was first announced. Her wardrobe had been consolidated to just the red and blue uniforms, which had made fashion a bit of a challenge. But in a way, it had become nice to not have to pick something to wear every morning. It was one less decision to make, and as long as it kept the gods arguing, it would delay the apocalypse.\n\nThe uniform was also great for the weather. Since the gods began their feud, the weather across Earth had been 78 degrees everyday. The sea level had risen to engulf a significant portion of the Earth's land and coastal cities, and the overwhelming majority of the planet's plants and animals had gone extinct. The people of Earth agreed that this was a huge bummer, but much more palatable than the destruction of the entire planet.\n\nWith her uniform on, Rachel checked her text from Brittany. \"Turn on Apocalypse Later, it's so good today.\"\n\nRachel clicked on her TV and turned to channel 1. Fire and Ice were shouting at each other, as they usually did. Rachel rolled her eyes.\n\nAt the best of times, Apocalypse Later reminded Rachel of The Truman Show, a movie she had loved before humanity had turned their full attention to Fire and Ice. Like Truman, Fire and Ice's daily lives were broadcast 24/7, on a six hour delay. At times, the show was entertaining, and at others profoundly beautiful, but it usually just devolved into trashy reality TV.\n\nIce was entering the confessional, barely containing his laughter. \"I just used Fire's toothbrush to clean the toilet,\" he said, beaming. \"She's going to leave after that, I just know it.\"\n\nRachel flicked off the TV. She'd already had enough of the gods antics. After eating breakfast, she opened the front door to begin her walk to work, and was met by a gust of wind and heavy snow. Panicked, she looked up to the sky.\n\nFire was gone.\n\nRachel screamed, and ran back inside her house. She turned on the TV to see that Apocalypse Later had been interrupted by a news broadcast.\n\n\"We repeat,\" the anchor said solemnly. \"NASA has confirmed that a shuttle is being launched right now, with a new toothbrush for Fire. There is currently no word on whether the deity will return.\"\n\nRachel watched the TV with her mouth agape. She prayed the shuttle would not be too late.

I took all this in in about a three seconds before realizing I should be taking cover, and so I did. \n\n\nThe humans seemed very fit, though quite thin, and wore faded, torn and dirty clothes. The pigmen were mostly naked but for swords and knives. What were these creatures? And why were the humans killing them. \n\nI watched them from behind some debris as they wiped out the pigs. And then, when the shooting stopped, got out of my hiding place and approached them cautiously, hands raised and outstretched, plans facing forward. \n\nOne of them turned and looked at me warily, but did not attack. She nudged the meanest looking one of them for his attention, and he gazed upon me with cold, calculating eyes. \n\n\"That's quite enough. Stop there.

What you'll learn here. It's important if humans gonna survive. So listen. Those fuckers we killed there? They're Swiners. Don't know what they're actually called. Is what we call em. They started appearing first. I think in the year 2056. From down below. Turns out they live in the magma layer of the Earth. They weren't like that when we first discovered them. But they mutated. And were sentient to begin with, so they came out in huge numbers, mutated, and killed off like most of the Central America. That's where they first appeared cuz that's where the first breach into the magma layer happened.\n\n\"Next came the Aliens. Weirdly enough, they came in peace, and to prove that, they killed a lot of the Swiners for us. Wait I didn't tell you the numbers. During the first breach, close to a billion of the Swiners came pouring out. A second breach happened in Australia, but not many people died because the Aliens were already here helping us. So yeah. The Aliens came in peace and helped us. They just wanted to say hi and learn about us. But what they did was bring with themselves some parasite. Now this parasite somehow only affected the dead sentient beings on the planet. Basically raised them from the dead. But the parasite is the control element. The body's just the host. So we gotta deal with these Zombies.\n\n\"Now,  we humans weren't sure if the Aliens brought the parasite on purpose, but we were already so paranoid we basically lashed out at the Aliens. The Aliens apologised and left. Mostly. Some stayed behind to try and fix the mess, but we weren't cooperating, and killed one of their nobility or something, and they all came back for an all out war. \n\n\"There's only a handful of humans left, James. And we're fighting Zombies of humans and Swiners alike, and Aliens, too. The Aliens kill the Zombies, too, but out of self-preservation, not out of compassion of humans. The Zombies don't have No purpose other then kill and spread. \n\n\"And that's about it. Go back now. Fix this mess before we can start it. Go. Now.

Famine took one last drag on his cigar. \"Not this again\" he thought. This was meant to be his apocalypse. Everyone was going to starve to death under his totalitarian reign as his horse trampled crop field after crop field. But no, it couldn't be that simple, because Death had shown up. Death, who has the power to cut out the 'starving to' in starving to death. Death, who was so OP compared to all the other horsemen. Death, who had the biggest horse, for no reason other than divine favouritism. Famine had complained in both heaven and hell about Death being overpowered, and that it was unfair that he always got the kill becuase he literally is the kill, but to no avail. Post-mortal beurocracy meant that it was unlikely that God had even heard his concerns, let alone actually thought about them. \"It's no wonder purgatory's so big if they're that slow at processing things\", Famine thought.

''FINALLY! After six thousand years of waiting, I shall strike back at Yahweh for casting out my father! The fallen shall be avenged!'' screamed the pale child with the black beady eyes. He called forth his army of darkness, with the four riders and the legions of the damned and at last his freed father, Lucifer the Prince of Hell.\n\n\nAnd on the horizon they appeared, the army of heaven. Except something seemed different about them. Not the shining shimmering host that the Antichrist knew was coming. No instead this army was clad in iron armor and were riding giant wolves, and of the three largest of those, two jumped up into the heavens and... ate the sun and moon? The Legions of Hell stared in amazement at the sight of these monsters.\n\n\nLucifer asked his son: ''Who are those guys, did you recruit them? Because I like their style. With them on our side we will definitely win.'' The Antichrist was at a loss for words. Who were these human-yet-not creatures marching in the general direction of The Legions of Hell. From the dark oceans rose a giant ship that was made of human nails, and sailed by the beach, humongous and dark filled to the brim with what seemed to be humans and fire-demons that joined up with the strange army. Lucifer was pleased: ''More? This day just keeps on getting better and better! I am proud of you junior.'' The Antichrist was afraid of what would happen once his father discovered that these were not reinforcements, but he dared not to speak up.\n\n\nGreat clamor arose from both the strange army and the demonic legions when a third group descended from the heavens. It was a great many animals and humans fighting an equally great legion of monstrous beings. The nesperidian beings from beyond the stars, fought against a brave group of giant-dragon-snakes, spirit coyotes and god-humans seemingly unaware of the Legions from Hell and the army of strange beings. In the meanwhile Lucifer rode out to meet and greet the ''reinforcements''.\n\n\n''Hail thee, I am glad that you have come to aid in my war against the unjust Yahweh, the creator of all things.'' Lucifer bellowed at the one of the strangers, a tall man with dark hair who was dressed in the finest gleaming armor and who seemed to be a leader among that army. ''Yahweh? Isn't that the southern guy who got killed like a little bitch? What is his foe doing here? We are the J\u00f6tnar, I am Loki, schemer and warchief and we have come to do battle against Odin the Allfather.'' That did not go well with Lucifer who was angered that the lesser gods had come to intervene in his rebellion, so he struck Loki with his sword of black fire, or so it seemed to him, until the Loki the Liar stabbed him in the heart from behind and Lucifer screamed in pain, it felt like being cast out of heaven again. ''Don't be so cocky you southern weakling. We have come to do battle with Odin, and we will slaughter anyone who stands in our way.'' sneered the trickster at the lord of Hell. Lucifer's mighty wail could be heard by the Legions of Hell, who looked upon the boy Antichrist, who now assumed that this other army was the Host of Heaven in disguise, so he gave the order to charge in and aid the Lightbringer in defeating them.\n\n\nThe third group had finally quieted down. The great feathered dragon-serpent god Quetzalcoatl looked upon the mighty coyote-god Huehuecoyotl, and they smiled, the first of the battles against the mighty monsters from beyond reality had been beaten, although it seemed that two more groups of their ancient foe had come to be the next to fall against the onslaught of the bestial and wild gods of the Aztecs. For while the humans had failed in their charge to strengthen the gods so that the sun could live, they would not fail to defeat the Centzonhuitznahua and their leader, their vile kin, Coyolxauhqui and from her corpse Quetzalcoatl would make a new sun, this time to last forever. So he called Tlaloc to gather the warrior-gods to make glorious charge on the evil star-gods.\n\n\nLucifer was the first to fall, and in the War of the End he was the first to die. The Antichrist, now the new prince of Hell he fought fiercely at the center, desperately wanting to avenge his unholy father by killing the lying man. Quetzalcoatl fought against the world serpent J\u00f6rmungandr and the demon-lord Baal. Surt the fire-jotunn and wolf Fenris did battle with Azazel and Gadreel while Chalchiuhtlicue wildly striking everything in sight. Gods and demons fought in the greatest battle ever known to be.\n\n\nYet as the three divine armies clashed, another two arrived. From the north of the plain came the mighty army of Asgard, led by Odin, Tyr and Thor. They asked no questions, pondered not the appearance of strange beings unknown. All the Aesir and the Einherjar had prepared for was this, RAGNAROK the final battle where all the answers would finally be given and all the world would be torn asunder, yet with a slim hope of victory and renewal. They marched to the sound of horns under the Raven banner of Odin Allfather, the king of the gods. For them, this day was long awaited, and yet not dreaded. They had long since made peace with their death, all that mattered was to make sure that whether they were victorious or not, only that they died with honour and glory. \n\n\nTo the south came a man riding upon a donkey, his thorny crown, his shepherd's staff and long grey robes looked out of place on a battlefield. By his side was his father-who-was-him in the shape of a cool soothing light, who also looked out of place. Yet the legions that followed in their wake did not. Great fiery beings, with hundreds of wings and arms holding great flaming swords. They shone with a light of purity and righteousness, and as the Shepherd of Men charged, they flew ahead, singing hymns and praises to their god.\n\n\nAnd from some incomprehensible and unknowable angle of space-time came Kalki, the final form of Lord Vishnu, who would bring the end and rebirth of reality to be. He charged, followed by all the divines of the Hindu to end all of reality, so it could be reincarnated. Kali with her thuggees, Ganesh charging ahead. All fought with zeal and force.\n\n\nFrom the skies came thunder, and the heavens were torn asunder as Zeus cast down his lightning bolts upon the many armies, letting the Olympians march downwards, followed by the great heroes of legend, such as Perseus, Odysseus, Achilles and countless others. Poseidon fought alongside his brother Zeus, and Hades unlocked the titans from Tartarus, sending them into the fray, allowing them to alleviate the madness and anger from being looked up since the golden age.\n\n\nIt was gruesome indeed, as Thor's hammer smashed Ganesh's face in with the force of all storms. Mj\u00f6lnir would return to the thunder-god as he raced towards the two great dragons, one who he alone was destined to kill, Jormungardr and they began their third and last battle together. Nidhoggr came and ate scores of minor demons and lesser Hindu gods until Angra Mainyu grabbed hold of the dragon\u2019s tail and brought it down to the ground, where they fought. Baraqiel the fallen angel fought hand to hand with Freyr the norse gods of farmers and fertility. The valkyries rained down upon the fallens angels and fought them in the skies. Michael the Archangel was consumed by Quetzalcoatl the Feathered Serpent, and Gabriel could but weep to behold his brother\u2019s death, yet he ran to fight that terrible demon regardless. Yahweh, Odin, Ahura Mazda and Zeus met each other in combat at the center of the battlefield, and the terrible carnage that rose from a battle between four divine chieftains was enough to shatter the very earth around them, crushed continents, raised mountains and evaporated the very seas themselves. The stars imploded and re-made themselves in a cacophony of terror and war.\n\nIn the middle of it all stood one confused child, commanding the armies of hell beset by all sides from all manner of divine armies. A child who had thought his destiny to be clear, destroy Yahweh with his father and then rule over all the domains together with his dad. Yet the terrible tides of chance had washed that destiny away. And now his father had been slain by someone unknown to him. Everywhere great and terrible magic was used that tears down the world around him. What kind of apocalypse was this? "], [1, "It's only been seven hours, and I think I'd rather just kill myself than put with more of this shit. First, it was the aliens. They showed up around 11:00 this morning to drain all the resources of this planet. Problem is, the new AI defense network gained sentiencs like five minutes after, and since its number one priority is to keep itself online, it declared war on the aliens *and* humanity so that *it* could use the resources for itself.\n\nAbout an hour later, the alien ships began to be destroyed by the superior AI, and when they crashed, the exploded bigger than any nuclear bomb, creating a radioactive wasteland covered in an irradiated alien virus that turned people into these radioactive vampire-zombies that would attack anything that moves. After just three hours, earth's resources had been almost completely drained and gone towards the battle of aliens, robots, and vampire-zombies. We had been making bets on which faction would kill us first, or if we would die from a lack of water when we saw a great light in the sky.\n\nWe just couldn't belive it when Jesus Christ came floating down from the heavens and got jumped by a couple of robots. An army of angels came from the sky at the same time that demons rose from the ground, but instead of fighting each other, they teamed up to kill everything else so that they could have *their* apocalypse. When they were about done, Kali and Odin both showed up and started to kick the crap out of Jesus while Satan started laughing and recorded it on his phone. When Jesus was able to get away, and flew back to heaven.\n\nI can only assume he tattled to his dad because God himself came down and said \"**ALRIGHT. EVERYONE NEEDS TO CHILL THE FUCK OUT FOR A MINUTE. LET'S FIGURE THIS SHIT OUT.**\" And then the sun turned red and began to expand. \"**OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.**\" God snapped his fingers and extinguished the sun, which is where we are now.\n\n\"**ALL RIGHT. I THINK I HAVE A SOLUTION. I'M JUST GONNA ACCELERATE THE HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE HERE. GRAVITY WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE THE UNIVERSE TO COLLAPSE IN ON ITSELF AND EXPLODE, CAUSING ANOTHER BIG BANG. IF NO ONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS, I'M JUST GONNA KILL EVERYTHING AND WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN. JUST START OVER.**\"\n\n\"Uh, God? I have a-\"\n\n\"**TOO LATE! NO TIME FOR QUESTIONS!**\"\n\nAnd then God snapped his fingers to kill the universe, but nothing happened. \"**THE HELL?**\" And then God looked around to see Protestant God, Catholic God, Old testament God, and Allah. And then they all began to punch each other in the face and fought until they destroyed the universe in the process."]], [[{"comment": "**Off-Topic Discussion**: Reply here for non-story comments.\n\n---\n\n[^(What is this?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/off_topic) ^\u2022 [^(First time here?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) ^\u2022 [^(Special Announcements)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/announcements)\n", "id": "daqs6ms"}], [{"comment": "Fire and Ice hovered in their spots above Earth, bickering as usual.\n\n\"Look at how many people favor me!\" Fire said, giving Ice a hard shove. \"Just find your own planet, I've got dibs on this one.\"\n\nIce stared back angrily. \"I'm also great! I'm definitely sufficient enough to destroy the planet. And look at how many fans I have.\"\n\nFire looked down upon the Earth, dismayed by the sheer number of people that thought destruction ice would be \"great\". Every day, the people of the planet gathered to watch Fire and Ice's arguments, and wonder if this would finally be the day that one of the entities did them in. The uniform on Earth had been reduced to two possible garments: a red T shirt and pair of athletic shorts with \"Team Fire\" emblazoned across the chest, and a light blue T shirt/athletic short combo that read \"Team Ice\". Their numbers were almost exactly equal.\n\n\"How about this,\" Ice said, once Fire had calmed down a bit. \"We'll go down to Earth and put it to a vote among the people. Whoever wins gets to destroy the planet.\"\n\n\"We've already tried that, twice,\" Fire said, \"The votes came out exactly 50/50.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you're right...\" Ice thought for a second. \"You know, the idea of destroying the planet is fun and all, but I really miss my wife and kids.

She had two text messages; one from the government and one from Brittany.\n\nThe government's text was automated, and came at the same time as it had every day before. Today, Rachel was on \"Team Fire.\" She rolled out of bed and picked one of her five red T shirts and a pair of red shorts. \n\nThe uniform had been a bit upsetting when it was first announced. Her wardrobe had been consolidated to just the red and blue uniforms, which had made fashion a bit of a challenge. But in a way, it had become nice to not have to pick something to wear every morning. It was one less decision to make, and as long as it kept the gods arguing, it would delay the apocalypse.\n\nThe uniform was also great for the weather. Since the gods began their feud, the weather across Earth had been 78 degrees everyday. The sea level had risen to engulf a significant portion of the Earth's land and coastal cities, and the overwhelming majority of the planet's plants and animals had gone extinct. The people of Earth agreed that this was a huge bummer, but much more palatable than the destruction of the entire planet.\n\nWith her uniform on, Rachel checked her text from Brittany. \"Turn on Apocalypse Later, it's so good today.\"\n\nRachel clicked on her TV and turned to channel 1. Fire and Ice were shouting at each other, as they usually did. Rachel rolled her eyes.\n\nAt the best of times, Apocalypse Later reminded Rachel of The Truman Show, a movie she had loved before humanity had turned their full attention to Fire and Ice. Like Truman, Fire and Ice's daily lives were broadcast 24/7, on a six hour delay. At times, the show was entertaining, and at others profoundly beautiful, but it usually just devolved into trashy reality TV.\n\nIce was entering the confessional, barely containing his laughter. \"I just used Fire's toothbrush to clean the toilet,\" he said, beaming. \"She's going to leave after that, I just know it.\"\n\nRachel flicked off the TV. She'd already had enough of the gods antics. After eating breakfast, she opened the front door to begin her walk to work, and was met by a gust of wind and heavy snow. Panicked, she looked up to the sky.\n\nFire was gone.\n\nRachel screamed, and ran back inside her house. She turned on the TV to see that Apocalypse Later had been interrupted by a news broadcast.\n\n\"We repeat,\" the anchor said solemnly. \"NASA has confirmed that a shuttle is being launched right now, with a new toothbrush for Fire. There is currently no word on whether the deity will return.\"\n\nRachel watched the TV with her mouth agape. She prayed the shuttle would not be too late.

The people were using some type of future guns and the pig people were obviously outgunned. I took all this in in about a three seconds before realizing I should be taking cover, and so I did. \n\n\nThe humans seemed very fit, though quite thin, and wore faded, torn and dirty clothes. The pigmen were mostly naked but for swords and knives. What were these creatures? And why were the humans killing them. \n\nI watched them from behind some debris as they wiped out the pigs. And then, when the shooting stopped, got out of my hiding place and approached them cautiously, hands raised and outstretched, plans facing forward. \n\nOne of them turned and looked at me warily, but did not attack. She nudged the meanest looking one of them for his attention, and he gazed upon me with cold, calculating eyes. \n\n\"That's quite enough. Stop there.

What you'll learn here. It's important if humans gonna survive. So listen. Those fuckers we killed there? They're Swiners. Don't know what they're actually called. Is what we call em. They started appearing first. I think in the year 2056. From down below. Turns out they live in the magma layer of the Earth. They weren't like that when we first discovered them. But they mutated. And were sentient to begin with, so they came out in huge numbers, mutated, and killed off like most of the Central America. That's where they first appeared cuz that's where the first breach into the magma layer happened.\n\n\"Next came the Aliens. Weirdly enough, they came in peace, and to prove that, they killed a lot of the Swiners for us. Wait I didn't tell you the numbers. During the first breach, close to a billion of the Swiners came pouring out. A second breach happened in Australia, but not many people died because the Aliens were already here helping us. So yeah. The Aliens came in peace and helped us. They just wanted to say hi and learn about us. But what they did was bring with themselves some parasite. Now this parasite somehow only affected the dead sentient beings on the planet. Basically raised them from the dead. But the parasite is the control element. The body's just the host. So we gotta deal with these Zombies.\n\n\"Now,  we humans weren't sure if the Aliens brought the parasite on purpose, but we were already so paranoid we basically lashed out at the Aliens. The Aliens apologised and left. Mostly. Some stayed behind to try and fix the mess, but we weren't cooperating, and killed one of their nobility or something, and they all came back for an all out war. \n\n\"There's only a handful of humans left, James. And we're fighting Zombies of humans and Swiners alike, and Aliens, too. The Aliens kill the Zombies, too, but out of self-preservation, not out of compassion of humans.

He called forth his army of darkness, with the four riders and the legions of the damned and at last his freed father, Lucifer the Prince of Hell.\n\n\nAnd on the horizon they appeared, the army of heaven. Except something seemed different about them. Not the shining shimmering host that the Antichrist knew was coming. No instead this army was clad in iron armor and were riding giant wolves, and of the three largest of those, two jumped up into the heavens and... ate the sun and moon? The Legions of Hell stared in amazement at the sight of these monsters.\n\n\nLucifer asked his son: ''Who are those guys, did you recruit them? Because I like their style. With them on our side we will definitely win.'' The Antichrist was at a loss for words. Who were these human-yet-not creatures marching in the general direction of The Legions of Hell. From the dark oceans rose a giant ship that was made of human nails, and sailed by the beach, humongous and dark filled to the brim with what seemed to be humans and fire-demons that joined up with the strange army. Lucifer was pleased: ''More? This day just keeps on getting better and better! I am proud of you junior.'' The Antichrist was afraid of what would happen once his father discovered that these were not reinforcements, but he dared not to speak up.\n\n\nGreat clamor arose from both the strange army and the demonic legions when a third group descended from the heavens. It was a great many animals and humans fighting an equally great legion of monstrous beings. The nesperidian beings from beyond the stars, fought against a brave group of giant-dragon-snakes, spirit coyotes and god-humans seemingly unaware of the Legions from Hell and the army of strange beings. In the meanwhile Lucifer rode out to meet and greet the ''reinforcements''.\n\n\n''Hail thee, I am glad that you have come to aid in my war against the unjust Yahweh, the creator of all things.'' Lucifer bellowed at the one of the strangers, a tall man with dark hair who was dressed in the finest gleaming armor and who seemed to be a leader among that army. ''Yahweh? Isn't that the southern guy who got killed like a little bitch? What is his foe doing here? We are the J\u00f6tnar, I am Loki, schemer and warchief and we have come to do battle against Odin the Allfather.'' That did not go well with Lucifer who was angered that the lesser gods had come to intervene in his rebellion, so he struck Loki with his sword of black fire, or so it seemed to him, until the Loki the Liar stabbed him in the heart from behind and Lucifer screamed in pain, it felt like being cast out of heaven again. ''Don't be so cocky you southern weakling. We have come to do battle with Odin, and we will slaughter anyone who stands in our way.'' sneered the trickster at the lord of Hell. Lucifer's mighty wail could be heard by the Legions of Hell, who looked upon the boy Antichrist, who now assumed that this other army was the Host of Heaven in disguise, so he gave the order to charge in and aid the Lightbringer in defeating them.\n\n\nThe third group had finally quieted down. The great feathered dragon-serpent god Quetzalcoatl looked upon the mighty coyote-god Huehuecoyotl, and they smiled, the first of the battles against the mighty monsters from beyond reality had been beaten, although it seemed that two more groups of their ancient foe had come to be the next to fall against the onslaught of the bestial and wild gods of the Aztecs. For while the humans had failed in their charge to strengthen the gods so that the sun could live, they would not fail to defeat the Centzonhuitznahua and their leader, their vile kin, Coyolxauhqui and from her corpse Quetzalcoatl would make a new sun, this time to last forever. So he called Tlaloc to gather the warrior-gods to make glorious charge on the evil star-gods.\n\n\nLucifer was the first to fall, and in the War of the End he was the first to die. The Antichrist, now the new prince of Hell he fought fiercely at the center, desperately wanting to avenge his unholy father by killing the lying man. Quetzalcoatl fought against the world serpent J\u00f6rmungandr and the demon-lord Baal. Surt the fire-jotunn and wolf Fenris did battle with Azazel and Gadreel while Chalchiuhtlicue wildly striking everything in sight. Gods and demons fought in the greatest battle ever known to be.\n\n\nYet as the three divine armies clashed, another two arrived. From the north of the plain came the mighty army of Asgard, led by Odin, Tyr and Thor. They asked no questions, pondered not the appearance of strange beings unknown. All the Aesir and the Einherjar had prepared for was this, RAGNAROK the final battle where all the answers would finally be given and all the world would be torn asunder, yet with a slim hope of victory and renewal. They marched to the sound of horns under the Raven banner of Odin Allfather, the king of the gods. For them, this day was long awaited, and yet not dreaded. They had long since made peace with their death, all that mattered was to make sure that whether they were victorious or not, only that they died with honour and glory. \n\n\nTo the south came a man riding upon a donkey, his thorny crown, his shepherd's staff and long grey robes looked out of place on a battlefield. By his side was his father-who-was-him in the shape of a cool soothing light, who also looked out of place. Yet the legions that followed in their wake did not. Great fiery beings, with hundreds of wings and arms holding great flaming swords. They shone with a light of purity and righteousness, and as the Shepherd of Men charged, they flew ahead, singing hymns and praises to their god.\n\n\nAnd from some incomprehensible and unknowable angle of space-time came Kalki, the final form of Lord Vishnu, who would bring the end and rebirth of reality to be. He charged, followed by all the divines of the Hindu to end all of reality, so it could be reincarnated. Kali with her thuggees, Ganesh charging ahead. All fought with zeal and force.\n\n\nFrom the skies came thunder, and the heavens were torn asunder as Zeus cast down his lightning bolts upon the many armies, letting the Olympians march downwards, followed by the great heroes of legend, such as Perseus, Odysseus, Achilles and countless others. Poseidon fought alongside his brother Zeus, and Hades unlocked the titans from Tartarus, sending them into the fray, allowing them to alleviate the madness and anger from being looked up since the golden age.\n\n\nIt was gruesome indeed, as Thor's hammer smashed Ganesh's face in with the force of all storms. Mj\u00f6lnir would return to the thunder-god as he raced towards the two great dragons, one who he alone was destined to kill, Jormungardr and they began their third and last battle together. Nidhoggr came and ate scores of minor demons and lesser Hindu gods until Angra Mainyu grabbed hold of the dragon\u2019s tail and brought it down to the ground, where they fought. Baraqiel the fallen angel fought hand to hand with Freyr the norse gods of farmers and fertility. The valkyries rained down upon the fallens angels and fought them in the skies. Michael the Archangel was consumed by Quetzalcoatl the Feathered Serpent, and Gabriel could but weep to behold his brother\u2019s death, yet he ran to fight that terrible demon regardless. Yahweh, Odin, Ahura Mazda and Zeus met each other in combat at the center of the battlefield, and the terrible carnage that rose from a battle between four divine chieftains was enough to shatter the very earth around them, crushed continents, raised mountains and evaporated the very seas themselves. The stars imploded and re-made themselves in a cacophony of terror and war.\n\nIn the middle of it all stood one confused child, commanding the armies of hell beset by all sides from all manner of divine armies. A child who had thought his destiny to be clear, destroy Yahweh with his father and then rule over all the domains together with his dad. Yet the terrible tides of chance had washed that destiny away. And now his father had been slain by someone unknown to him. Everywhere great and terrible magic was used that tears down the world around him. What kind of apocalypse was this?

The arrogance and confidence he would have boasted for any other face was absent once again. We looked across the dark room at one another as he let out a long and heavy sigh.\n\nI didn't really know why I was here with him tonight, or why I've been in this same room countless times before. I was well paid, of course. For my counseling services and for the secrecy. A wealthy and powerful businessman can't show weakness, after all, and visits to the psychologist don't look good to the shareholders.\n\n\"But that's all it is,\" he said, as his voice gained momentum, \"manipulation, fear, hate, extortion, bribery, lies.

Even so, there were times when I myself felt. . . compelled to come across town and see him on his request. I have even seen ordinary people, with no reason to like or listen to the man, throw themselves at his feet as if his sheer force of will commanded them to do so. He even proclaimed that the greater his desire and concentration, the more willing a person would be to meet his every need, although some people were immune to his beguiling charm. \"That's what the money's for,\" he would say. Obviously this combination of wealth and power had brought my client ever heightening success, usually accompanied by an equal arrogance in the public eye.\n\nBut tonight, I sat across from a lonely old man in a rare moment of weakness as he realized the cost of his methods to power. \n\n\"There is no truth in my life. No honesty or love. When I look into the eyes of my business partners, my employees and even my own family all I see is another price tag. And when I meet that price, all that's left is fear and hatred.

Maybe you're someone I can count on as more than someone looking for a handout.\"\n\nHe crossed the room and placed his hand on my shoulder in an uncharacteristic gesture of friendship. \"Thank you,\" he sighed, \"I'll be calling on you more in the future.

I don't think any one channel is going to tell you everything you need to know about people.\" \nHe nods, determined to watch every channel and learn as much as demonly possible about humans and their weaknesses. \n\nThe next day. \n\"I think I'll target America first.

I sat across from the same tired old man in another of our impromptu meetings as he looked quietly out the window over the city skyline.\n\n\"Everybody has a price,\" he muttered, \"all I have to do is tug on the right strings, like I always have.\" He shuffled lazily back to a lavish leather chair. The arrogance and confidence he would have boasted for any other face was absent once again. We looked across the dark room at one another as he let out a long and heavy sigh.\n\nI didn't really know why I was here with him tonight, or why I've been in this same room countless times before. I was well paid, of course. For my counseling services and for the secrecy. A wealthy and powerful businessman can't show weakness, after all, and visits to the psychologist don't look good to the shareholders.\n\n\"But that's all it is,\" he said, as his voice gained momentum, \"manipulation, fear, hate, extortion, bribery, lies. There isn't a soul out there who would be there for ME, without my money or my \"words\".\" he finished, gesturing with his fingers at the end. \n\nThis gesture referred to what my client believed to be a supernatural ability of his: a sort of mind control that he exerts on the \"lesser minded.\" I've tried to link such grandiose delusions to what I believe to be schizophrenia, or even just the warped worldview of one born into such wealth and power. Even so, there were times when I myself felt. . . compelled to come across town and see him on his request. I have even seen ordinary people, with no reason to like or listen to the man, throw themselves at his feet as if his sheer force of will commanded them to do so. He even proclaimed that the greater his desire and concentration, the more willing a person would be to meet his every need, although some people were immune to his beguiling charm. \"That's what the money's for,\" he would say. Obviously this combination of wealth and power had brought my client ever heightening success, usually accompanied by an equal arrogance in the public eye.\n\nBut tonight, I sat across from a lonely old man in a rare moment of weakness as he realized the cost of his methods to power. \n\n\"There is no truth in my life. No honesty or love. When I look into the eyes of my business partners, my employees and even my own family all I see is another price tag. And when I meet that price, all that's left is fear and hatred. And I'm the one who put it there.\" He paused and stared quietly into his hands, collecting his thoughts.\n\n\"It's not too late to change\" I spoke, for the first time since the start of the meeting, \"you have the power to find these things for yourself and stop what you're doing, if you really want to.\"\n\nFor what seemed like hours, we sat in silence. The flashes and blares of city life echoing faintly below.\n\n\"No,\" he exclaimed, \"Life is about give and take. Always has been. I have too much to lose to turn back now. If fear and hate is what people want, then that's what I'll give em.\"\n\nHe looked up from his contemplation and smiled. \"I didn't have to use my words to get you here tonight. Haven't in a while. Maybe you're someone I can count on as more than someone looking for a handout.\"\n\nHe crossed the room and placed his hand on my shoulder in an uncharacteristic gesture of friendship. \"Thank you,\" he sighed, \"I'll be calling on you more in the future. I'll fly you out to Washington myself as needed, of course.\"\n\n\"Absolutely, Donald,\" I replied, \"In a month, you're going to have a whole new host of stressors, and I want to be there to help you manage them.\"\n", "id": "daqylyj"}, {"comment": "I was like wow this is about some guy who may or not be a real demon this is going good, then I saw fucking Donald and everything went down the drain ( just like America in January hehe)", "id": "darh65t"}], [{"comment": "I come home, a bit tired from work. My roommate/friend sat on the couch watching tv. Zanathanos liked tv, he didn't have televisions in Hell, well he didn't have a lot of things in Hell. He's a tall demon, a muscular 7 feet or so tall with deep red skin. I seem to be his only friend, most humans freak out when they see him, but I didn't. \n\"Hey, still trying to gather information on how to take over the world?\" I ask, only half teasing. \n\"Oh yes, this television is quite the information gatherer. Today I learned your kind enjoy these thrifty stores called Pawn shops, and there seems to be a Pawn War going on. Also, there's an entire Dynasty of ducks, but the humans shoot the ducks, possibly to overthrow the Duck Dynasty. Oh, and humans hate the humans who take away their cars because they failed to pay the bank\" He says, eyes on the tv as it plays some cash for gold commercial. \nI chuckle, \"Sounds like you've been watching Tru tv all day.\" \n\"True tv?\" He raises an eyebrow. \nI grab the remote and open up the guide to all the channels. \n\"What is that?\" the demon asks, confused. \n\"The tv gets thousands of channels, some channels are dedicated for certain topics and interests; anime, home shopping, kids' shows, sports, and more.\" \nThe demon grabbed the remote, amazed by all the channels. \"So much data, how do I know what is relevant to my take over?\" \n\"I suppose you don't, humans come in a vast array of personalities and abilities. I don't think any one channel is going to tell you everything you need to know about people.\" \nHe nods, determined to watch every channel and learn as much as demonly possible about humans and their weaknesses. \n\nThe next day. \n\"I think I'll target America first. It's large, a young nation of only about 200 years old, I'm older than that, and it has a sizable military.\" Zanathanos says, proud of the research he did. \n\"And what makes you think a powerful nation like America will be taken over so easily by one demon?\" I ask, being the Devil's advocate to a demon. \n\"Well, ever since that loud orange man was elected the nation has been in chaos, plus he doesn't seem to know how to run a country. In a few months I'm sure he'll run the country into the ground and make it easy to take over.\" the demon says. \n\"I hope you know how to run a country then, inheriting a trash heap won't be easy. It's a lot of responsibility.\" I warn. \n\"Oh I know, some of the television programs give some details on what the American political system is like.
