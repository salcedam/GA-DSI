Or lack thereof.\n\nTrust in anything the media says - and trust in anything that comes from our government.\n\nThe part that scares me is I don't have any idea how it could be fixed.\n\nCurrently, people consume their version of the news. Everyone is carved up and isolated into what their own version of the truth is.\n\nTo me, everyone who currently disagrees with each other has absolutely no idea how to talk to the other side. Everyone is either a \"cry-baby libtard\" or \"a neo-nazi conservative.\"\n\nHow can we even hope to co-exist if nobody knows how to discuss differences of opinion with each other anymore?\n\n*edit: a word", "id": "daou4bl"}, {"comment": "I've been toying with the concept of *information stability* and how we've lost our footing in a flurry of technological advancements, which is similar to what you're saying.\n\nFor the vast majority of human history, the means through which we communicated information remained steady. Your parents, their parents, and their parents before them all grew up with the same systems. Spoken word evolved into written word over hundreds of years. Even telegraphs and telephones took most of a lifetime to transition.\n\nBut then we started seeing changes in the format of information within single lifespans. Radio and television arrived. Within years everyone relied on them and for most of the century, they dominated the dissemination of information.\n\nSince that time, there hasn't been a generation that's grown up with the same foundation for information as their predecessor. When I was born, families typically had a shared computer. Then there was a family cellphone, your dad had a beeper. Email was new! Then everyone had a cellphone. Then everyone's cellphone had the internet and a camera. Then came streaming music and movies. Then everyone had their own computers. Then everyone had their own desktop *and* laptop *and* a phone *and* a work phone. AOL, Blockbuster, Myspace, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Youtube, Reddit, Twitter. I have more technology in my pocket right now than existed fifty years ago. Two-year-olds have iPads. IPODS ARE OBSOLETE!\n\n---\n\nIn the chaos of these changes, we lost the common ground on which political information could reliably be exchanged. Where once we sought out a single core source from amongst a handful of choices, today we have hundreds of outlets, thousands of articles, and hundreds of millions of responses.\n\nTo continue seeking a singular source is no longer responsible. Instead of searching desperately for neutrality, it's become more valuable to collect predictable biases and sift through insightful responses. Reporters can only have so much expertise and, invariably, will be outspoken by their own audience (which is why nobody reads articles on Reddit!).\n\nThink of what you consider to be a decent source for information. To me, right now, that's Reddit. Here I can find everything I need to construct a reliable aggregate. I have access to seemingly everything.\n\nNow realize that each successive generation of human beings has been shattered and scattered over a series of dramatically changed formats. I trust Reddit. My mom trusts Facebook. Her mom trusts Yahoo. My other grandma trusts TV news. At this point the number of information foundations on which humanity relies is too broad to ever be consolidated.\n\n---\n\nThe trouble with rapid progress is what happens when we stumble. In the past, you could reasonably encounter and understand just about every change in the world. There wasn't that much going on and the things that were occurring made sense.\n\nToday, there are a thousand new scientific breakthroughs every time you open a browser. Every new revelation requires that we assume that it's true. Nobody has time to check even a tiny portion of what they read, so the only way we'll get anything done is if we continue to make these assumptions, layering them over and over and over again.\n\nAnyone who has to take a break from this system becomes disconnected from that stack of assumptions. Suddenly the world around you is talking as if magic is real and ponies can fly. Forward mobility within information comes to a halt. Climate change seems unimportant. Fake news sounds real. You trust a single TV personality to tell you about the whole world. You firmly believe your niece wants socks for her Birthday.\n\nFalling behind within the world of information is like joining an MMO a few years after it was popular or playing a classic video game way too late.\n\n---\n\nWhew.

They have a history of repeated failed doomsday predictions that they've used to spike membership and encourage people to abandon their lives and careers instead. \n\nOh, and they've lost millions of dollars through recent child abuse lawsuits and their leaders have archives of known pedophiles whose identities they won't release. They are under investigation for their handling of sex abuse cases in Australia as we speak, and the Australian Royal Commission recently published a pretty scathing critique of their practices. \n\nAh, and the whole thing where homosexuality is a choice and that homosexuals should just not have relationships until God fixes them in his new order.

I like his show, and I think he makes many good points on a variety of topics. Additionally, I'm a moderate, but I typically lean conservative.\n\nWhen I watched this interview a couple things really struck me. The first is that neither of them seemed altogether that comfortable and the debate seemed rather forced, but I guess that's simply what happens when two polar opposite people debate.\n\nThe second was that I don't think Trevor Noah is a good interviewer. A lot of people are saying he really stepped it up here and he put on a great performance, and I have a problem with that sentiment. If this was meant to be an organized debate, then Trevor Noah really stepped it up and delivered blowing rebuttals. However, I was more expecting an interview, where he would ask her questions and she would give explanations and he would dive deeper into the explanations. I can't argue that that didn't occur, but he seemed so steadfast in arguing against her points that he made more \"do you know this\" or \"have you considered this\" rather than \"why do you believe this\". As a host and an interviewer, it completely shifts the dynamic of the conversation and artificially makes her look worse than she was. \n\nThe third is that Tomi Lahren is incredibly contradictory. She applied arguments for her side that didn't work on the other side so many times. It was actually a little painful at times. However, she did make a few good points and rebuttals. However, everytime she did so, Trevor Noah would change the subject and we were kind of left with this hanging thought of, \"wait I want to hear more about that.\" With only 30 min, you have to move fast, so I understand that but overall it's a bit annoying for an interview.\n\nI think the immigrant question is a serious one. It's not just Tomi Lahren is a hypocrite and we should disregard it. I think there are benefits to having illegal immigrants but it isn't fair to those who come here legally. In life, someone is always getting screwed and someone is always getting rewarded and assigning who those people is a really complex and difficult decision that should not be summed up by the thought process, our ancestors immigrated here when people were first coming over.\n\nLastly, I love Trevor Noah's reaction when he realizes she asked \"what did the KKK do?\" There was a moment of him speaking and then you can see it click in his head, and the reaction is fantastic. Must have played that over like 15 times.\n\nOverall, solid 30 minutes of my life. 7/10 might watch again."], [7, "Seeing stuff like this makes me bummed I don't watch tv as much as i used to.

If they do that, then seasoned city-dwellers are going to drudge past the protest just like they would a homeless camp, earbuds firmly inserted, making eye contact with no one.\n\nThey get all the attention they get *because* they inconvenience people.\n\nI do obviously draw the line at physical violence, vandalism, or blocking areas that may be a vital access route to emergency facilities such as hospitals and fire departments, and I'm against blocking freeways for similar public safety reasons.\n\nEven with those caveats it's still a grey area, but I have a hard time with the idea that protests can't inconvenience people. There's got to be some balance, but the nature of both the fringe/anarchist types that many protests seem to attract (even if the protest has nothing to do with that) and the authoritarian police showing up with riot shields and tear gas makes it difficult to create any sort of ideal scenario.\n\nI'm not 100% sure how to fix that, but at the very least I'm sure we agree that Tomi Lahren's lazy \"suck-it-up\" non-answer isn't a solution.", "id": "daocba9"}, {"comment": "the other thing people say is \"MLK would never support this\" when you KNOW the people saying that would be the first people to express their disgust about, for instance, the march on selma. i'm sure they'd even be able to justify the dog attacks and watercannons for the peaceful sit-in protests.", "id": "dao3lij"}, {"comment": "They're justifying those things right now with the Dakota Pipeline.", "id": "dao3pqy"}, {"comment": "think of the rodney king tapes. when that leaked everyone agreed that it didnt matter what he had done, nobody deserved to have that happen to them- change was needed. if that was today? his entire history would be put on full display and the right wing would rush to say he deserved it. every single minor infraction in his past would be used against him as if it mattered. that was over 25 years ago and we've literally gone backwards since then in terms of our discourse", "id": "dao7i5a"}, {"comment": "[Letter from a Birmingham Jail](https://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html) is a great read of MLK's and discusses this idea of protests as well.

Left-leaning whites in the 50s and 60s passively opposed civil rights with sentiments like \"I more or less agree with their aims, but do they have to be so loud about it?\" It's not exclusively a white-on-black thing either. Women who wanted to work as equals to men have been dismissed as harridans, lesbians, penis-enviers, and before that as hysterics. Look at how Trump supporters are dismissed as \"angry\" white males as if anger invalidates their views.\n\nWhen you shirk reason and evidence in favor of rhetorical trickery like tone policing and epithet you invite the opposition to abandon the argument as well. Then all bets are off and the winner becomes whoever screams (or memes, as this election showed) the hardest.

We should always want people to immigrate here legally, but also try and empathize and understand why people do resort to coming here illegally)   And lastly, we need to streamline a lot of our immigration process and although its important to properly vet people...a huge reason why so many people come here illegally is because of how hard it is to get here legally.

Much of the people are hostile towards you and you will forever face the risk of jail and/or deportation at any time.\n\nOr you can pay a relatively small price to immigrate legally, wait the allotted amount of time while working in your home country, arrive in said country legally to a find a job fairly easily compared to if you had done it illegally.\n\nOr you can spend no money and stay at your job in your home country and feel secure that you will never be deported, where you know the culture/language and are a part of the community.\n\nNow why the hell would anyone in their right mind choose option one? They only choose that option when the other two aren't possibly available.

I like his show, and I think he makes many good points on a variety of topics.

The first is that neither of them seemed altogether that comfortable and the debate seemed rather forced, but I guess that's simply what happens when two polar opposite people debate.\n\nThe second was that I don't think Trevor Noah is a good interviewer. A lot of people are saying he really stepped it up here and he put on a great performance, and I have a problem with that sentiment. If this was meant to be an organized debate, then Trevor Noah really stepped it up and delivered blowing rebuttals. However, I was more expecting an interview, where he would ask her questions and she would give explanations and he would dive deeper into the explanations. I can't argue that that didn't occur, but he seemed so steadfast in arguing against her points that he made more \"do you know this\" or \"have you considered this\" rather than \"why do you believe this\". As a host and an interviewer, it completely shifts the dynamic of the conversation and artificially makes her look worse than she was. \n\nThe third is that Tomi Lahren is incredibly contradictory. She applied arguments for her side that didn't work on the other side so many times. It was actually a little painful at times. However, she did make a few good points and rebuttals. However, everytime she did so, Trevor Noah would change the subject and we were kind of left with this hanging thought of, \"wait I want to hear more about that.\" With only 30 min, you have to move fast, so I understand that but overall it's a bit annoying for an interview.\n\nI think the immigrant question is a serious one. It's not just Tomi Lahren is a hypocrite and we should disregard it. I think there are benefits to having illegal immigrants but it isn't fair to those who come here legally. In life, someone is always getting screwed and someone is always getting rewarded and assigning who those people is a really complex and difficult decision that should not be summed up by the thought process, our ancestors immigrated here when people were first coming over.\n\nLastly, I love Trevor Noah's reaction when he realizes she asked \"what did the KKK do?\" There was a moment of him speaking and then you can see it click in his head, and the reaction is fantastic.

When she was able to respond coherently, Trevor would either move on quickly to the next subject rather than rebuttal or just make a straw man joke to get a rise out of the crowd. \n\nI wish he would of been able to delve deeper into the subjects. I get that it's a comedy show but when he made the traffic light joke, That wasn't a checkmate moment. That was him taking a hyperbole \"I don't see color\" and misconstruing it into a witty comeback. Too many attempted condescending gotcha jokes from Trevor which is part of the reason why Trump won and conservatives were revolting. Because for so long the right has been patronized by left media and been called stupid/racist which don't get me wrong, in many cases it's well warranted but sometimes I think the better way is to just discuss ideas without disrespecting the other side because when you do that you paint their constituency with a broad brush (I know right media does this too).

We almost stopped watching the show altogether because Phil was just too ridiculous. \n\nThe show had too much focus on him when all the other characters were far more interesting. In season three it's been going through and expanding the narrative on the other characters in the show. They're each getting their own storylines and Phil, while still heavily involved, is taking a back seat. There's still the occasional scene that makes me roll my eyes, but I love Carroll in the show and it is now more about all these different people trying to live together and make it work. Not \"How can Phil fuck up everything this week because he's a selfish prick?\" \n\nI may be remembering wrong and it could have been towards the end of season 2, but there does seem to be a turning point for the show.

For the most part the actual editing is fine. It's the overall A&E style that I take issue with (Which the editing executed successfully) I'll talk about the first minute or two in detail.\n\nSo the program starts off with a confessional from Leah, which is fine, but right off the bat there is some \"A&E-ness\" going on. She relays a statement from the church calling the show a \"cheap reality tv show\" and then immediately deadpans the camera with a atmospheric swell in the background and an impact transition. This is something used in all the popular unscripted series right now (Chrissly, DuckD, Kard). I guess they thought that would be funny or a lampshade (Or worse- good), but I thought it was a tacky way to start the show. Closing with an awkward fade... we have the next scene...\n\nWhich is *another* confessional at a different location. Two confessionals back to back usually doesn't work and this one is MUCH more serious, and was probably the original opening to the show, as it is much more searing and effectual. It's almost if they had an alternate opening on the timeline and forgot to rem the weaker one. I know that's not what happened, but it's better thought than someone actually choosing to open the show this way, when you have the best possible opening already there. (Maybe they wanted to have a statement by the church to open the show?)\n\nI don't want to be here all night, but just look at the transitions(1:45, 1:52) they use sometimes (tv static, chaos). Most serious documentaries would use hard cuts, (while much more clinical, imagine a Ken Burns program) and the occasional fade. Animated transitions usually come off gimmicky, implying the content of the program isn't engaging enough on its own, which I don't thing this program need *at all*. Now that I think about it, it feels like one of Charlie Brooker's 'wipe shows, which is very satirical and self-aware. This topic is too serious for that (attempted) treatment.\n\nSome of the text dumps weren't long enough. At 1:15 there is a full page of text which is cut just a second or two short (It was probably fine before a fade got added to the end of it).  \n\nThis is very much A&E's style so I mean what can you expect (this may all be on purpose). There's a bunch of other small nitpicky stuff, but it was enough for me to notice (This is what I do). Not all of it was bad, I liked the L Ron Hubbard montage at 1:30 (just not the transition out of it). \n\nOverall, I think Leah did a great job constructing the narrative and will be absolutely be watching every week.

If you do something 200+ times it's bound to get repetitive. Think about it. As actors you have the same job for a decade, with little time to go do other projects without getting overworked. The writers have to continuously come up with new things for the characters to do while also still remaining true to those characters and entertaining. And often these shows only have 1 or 2 directors so that must be the most mundane job ever. All of this considering that television is supposed to be a creative outlet for these people.\n\nSo I can understand how a show might get stale after a while. Coupled with the fact that it takes most shows a while to get good as well.\n\nAs to your most general point, I don't think that sitcoms have \"lost their magic\". There are some pretty \"magical\" sitcoms out there right now IMO. \n\nThe best comedy on TV is Veep, followed closely by Silicon Valley. Both those shows aren't traditional sitcoms, they're slightly more serial. They still count but based on the shows you mentioned maybe not what you necessarily mean.\n\nAmong network sitcoms, the best is most certainly Brooklyn Nine-Nine. If we're talking about magic, I think that show has it. I don't think I laugh at any other show more these days, the characters feel fresh and comfortable, the chemistry is amazing. Captain Holt is one of the best characters on TV.\n\nOtherwise there's The Last Man On Earth, The Good Place, Superstore, The Goldbergs, Fresh Off The Boat, The Middle, New Girl, Son of Zorn, IASIP when it comes back... some good shit out there man."], [8, "I honestly think the creation of shows with  a singular camera helped shape the new form of sitcom. Shows like The Office and Arrested Development helped shape this new style of comedy by actually having to consistently write good jokes without having a laugh track. "], [5, "I think that pacing is a big problem with sitcoms today. They seem too focused on getting laughs or being provocative that they feel like every line has to be a zinger, and that's not realistic or funny.

"], [4, "They almost all fall victim to becoming more drama than comedy. It's hard to really keep the jokes coming when the viewers begin to care about the characters.  Most sitcoms are really just light-hearted soap operas. I've been watching Kevin can't wait because my wife likes it and that show drives me up the wall. Why does that girl put up with that guy? He simply has no redeeming qualities. The show should really about the wife and how she is about to leave him at every episode. "], [3, "> How I Met Your Mother, overall an excellent show\n\nExcept its crap-tier ending."], [5, "For me, Seinfeld was probably the pinnacle of the classic sitcom. \n\nAfter that we got into the more modern era of single-camera dramedy-style \"sitcoms\". Of those, Arrested Development and Scrubs were probably the best. \n\nThere really hasn't been much else since. \n\nI think the problem with sitcoms is that there's only so many \"situations\" they can put the characters in, and the vast history of sitcoms that came before have already done that. So what we get is either rehashes of old plots, or attempts to make topical humor which will date the show on any attempt to watch it again. Or even worse, trying to play off racial stereotypes as humor now that society is accepting enough to have minorities as regular characters on sitcoms. \n\nI'm not sure sitcoms can be saved at this point. I watch that Tim Allen one on occasion because my parents have it on when I go visit. I feel my brain trying to throttle itself the entire time. I don't get it. I used to love Home Improvement... maybe we as a society have just moved onto more sophisticated things. \n\nI think I much prefer the direction of shows like Kimmy Schmidt and Todd Margaret. It's comedy, but not situational; it's taking a page from serials and having an overarching plot. That's probably the way things are going to go from now on. We've moved passed the sitcom. "], [3, "The reason modern sitcoms sucks is they are not being honest, and they have nothing interesting to say.\n\nThe last good one, in my opinion was Scrubs, and that one mixed in drama in a powerful and effective way, that I was hoping would be the new direction Sitcoms would take. But nope, Big Bang is just an endless repetition of making fun of socially awkward/Asperger people, and Brooklyn Nine nine, the one I was really hoping would go the Scrubs route, is just a silly show, albeit funny from time to time, it does not live up to the greats.\n\nCheers, Fraiser, Seinfeld and Friends. Despite the humor, these shows were honest about the human condition, and would talk honestly about... well, sex.\n\nFriends had gags about sex that HIMYM completely avoided, Ross and Rachel (accidentally) filming a sex tape and then watching it, Phoebe's \"honeymoon phase\" with her new boyfriend, etc. not to mention Seinfeld, with its famous Masturbation competition and many other sexual topics.\n\nEven Fraiser was honest about it, in his own way, I remember the line: \"How can men use Sex to get what we want, SEX **IS** WHAT WE WANT!\" \n\nHillarious, and also TRUE. Its honest. New Girl Has some sex scenes between the titular character one some of her boyfriends, and they are just not fucking honest at all. Nobody treats sex like that, nobody talks about it like that.... It's stupid.\n\nIts notreally about Sex though, its about being Honest.\n\nWhich brings me to the mockery we call The Big Bang Theory. Nobody would want to live with Sheldon for more then 2 days, no one. That's the end of the it, he would be living alone, and having no friends.\n\nThe idea that they still drive him to and from work, because he was too stupid to get his own drivers licence, despite the fact that he never appreciates it and always seems to demand being driven around by the other characters.... It simply wouldn't happen.\n\nNot in real life, not even in any of the other shows. George might finagle some kind of similar arrangement, but it would never be allowed to last. Chandler would leave Joey on the street the very first time he tried that kind of attitude towards him.\n\nIt's just not remotely honest. \n\n[There was a show called Suburgatory.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1741256/?ref_=nm_knf_i2) Its about a girl and her father that moves to the Suburbs and she hates it... At least in the premise, then they had just no fucking idea where to go with it.\n\nThe Girl was played by Jane Levy, who played in Shameless, and the father was played by Jeremy Sisto (The Schizophrenic brother from Six Feet Under), and those are some good actors, so I gave it a shot.\n\nThen there was one episode (right before it got cancelled), I can't even explain this, it was so stupid... \n\nThe Father had gotten himself a new Girlfriend, the neighbor character, recent divorce, whatever... The character supposed to represent Suburbia in all its weirdness, but in a sweet way.\n\nSo, the plot point of that episode was, that she would pretend, and tell everyone around her, that Jeremy Sisto, was an amazing lover. Incredible in bed. And she would do this, by faking sex with him.\n\nNo no, no faking an orgasm. Faking Sex.\n\nLike, they would NOT have sex, and she would walk away pretending she just had amazing sex, living him puzzled in the bed.\n\nIts like..... who.....\n\nWho the fuck thought that was a good idea? When does that happen in real life? How is that remotely honest, or even passingly interesting?\n\nIt was just so stupid... like the writers had no fucking idea how to write for television, or a childrens menu...

Ted Danson's on The Good Place and he was in Cheers and an underrated show in Becker. Ofc, these are just shows that are on network television.  I haven't even mentioned stuff like Silicon Valley or Veep.  For past shows to rewatch, 30 Rock and The Office are comparable to Community and Parks and Rec.

And while the excellent writing gave all of them their moments, rehashing those ideas doesn't make great new TV. That being said, a lot of shows right now are trying really hard to break that mold and be great shows. One that specifically stands out, is \"Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia\" This show is probably one of the most under-rated on TV, which shows by it being verified for both its 13th, and 14th seasons. As long as those are shown as planned, it will officially overtake My Three Sons as the longest running, live action sitcom of all time. If you haven't seen that show, go give it a try before you denounce current sitcoms as crap. If you're looking for a show that started more recently, then check out Last Man On Earth. Its lead by Will Forte, and Kristen Schaal, of SNL and Bobs Burgers fame, respectively. Also, i usually hate animated shows, but Rick and Morty is another really excellent, creative sitcom.

They still count but based on the shows you mentioned maybe not what you necessarily mean.\n\nAmong network sitcoms, the best is most certainly Brooklyn Nine-Nine. If we're talking about magic, I think that show has it. I don't think I laugh at any other show more these days, the characters feel fresh and comfortable, the chemistry is amazing. Captain Holt is one of the best characters on TV.\n\nOtherwise there's The Last Man On Earth, The Good Place, Superstore, The Goldbergs, Fresh Off The Boat, The Middle, New Girl, Son of Zorn, IASIP when it comes back... some good shit out there man.", "id": "danqkxp"}], [{"comment": "I honestly think the creation of shows with  a singular camera helped shape the new form of sitcom.

Of those, Arrested Development and Scrubs were probably the best. \n\nThere really hasn't been much else since. \n\nI think the problem with sitcoms is that there's only so many \"situations\" they can put the characters in, and the vast history of sitcoms that came before have already done that. So what we get is either rehashes of old plots, or attempts to make topical humor which will date the show on any attempt to watch it again. Or even worse, trying to play off racial stereotypes as humor now that society is accepting enough to have minorities as regular characters on sitcoms. \n\nI'm not sure sitcoms can be saved at this point. I watch that Tim Allen one on occasion because my parents have it on when I go visit. I feel my brain trying to throttle itself the entire time. I don't get it. I used to love Home Improvement... maybe we as a society have just moved onto more sophisticated things. \n\nI think I much prefer the direction of shows like Kimmy Schmidt and Todd Margaret.

", "id": "danzg86"}], [{"comment": "The reason modern sitcoms sucks is they are not being honest, and they have nothing interesting to say.\n\nThe last good one, in my opinion was Scrubs, and that one mixed in drama in a powerful and effective way, that I was hoping would be the new direction Sitcoms would take. But nope, Big Bang is just an endless repetition of making fun of socially awkward/Asperger people, and Brooklyn Nine nine, the one I was really hoping would go the Scrubs route, is just a silly show, albeit funny from time to time, it does not live up to the greats.\n\nCheers, Fraiser, Seinfeld and Friends. Despite the humor, these shows were honest about the human condition, and would talk honestly about... well, sex.\n\nFriends had gags about sex that HIMYM completely avoided, Ross and Rachel (accidentally) filming a sex tape and then watching it, Phoebe's \"honeymoon phase\" with her new boyfriend, etc. not to mention Seinfeld, with its famous Masturbation competition and many other sexual topics.\n\nEven Fraiser was honest about it, in his own way, I remember the line: \"How can men use Sex to get what we want, SEX **IS** WHAT WE WANT!\" \n\nHillarious, and also TRUE. Its honest. New Girl Has some sex scenes between the titular character one some of her boyfriends, and they are just not fucking honest at all. Nobody treats sex like that, nobody talks about it like that.... It's stupid.\n\nIts notreally about Sex though, its about being Honest.\n\nWhich brings me to the mockery we call The Big Bang Theory. Nobody would want to live with Sheldon for more then 2 days, no one. That's the end of the it, he would be living alone, and having no friends.\n\nThe idea that they still drive him to and from work, because he was too stupid to get his own drivers licence, despite the fact that he never appreciates it and always seems to demand being driven around by the other characters.... It simply wouldn't happen.\n\nNot in real life, not even in any of the other shows. George might finagle some kind of similar arrangement, but it would never be allowed to last. Chandler would leave Joey on the street the very first time he tried that kind of attitude towards him.\n\nIt's just not remotely honest. \n\n[There was a show called Suburgatory.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1741256/?ref_=nm_knf_i2) Its about a girl and her father that moves to the Suburbs and she hates it... At least in the premise, then they had just no fucking idea where to go with it.\n\nThe Girl was played by Jane Levy, who played in Shameless, and the father was played by Jeremy Sisto (The Schizophrenic brother from Six Feet Under), and those are some good actors, so I gave it a shot.\n\nThen there was one episode (right before it got cancelled), I can't even explain this, it was so stupid... \n\nThe Father had gotten himself a new Girlfriend, the neighbor character, recent divorce, whatever... The character supposed to represent Suburbia in all its weirdness, but in a sweet way.\n\nSo, the plot point of that episode was, that she would pretend, and tell everyone around her, that Jeremy Sisto, was an amazing lover. Incredible in bed. And she would do this, by faking sex with him.\n\nNo no, no faking an orgasm. Faking Sex.\n\nLike, they would NOT have sex, and she would walk away pretending she just had amazing sex, living him puzzled in the bed.\n\nIts like..... who.....\n\nWho the fuck thought that was a good idea? When does that happen in real life? How is that remotely honest, or even passingly interesting?\n\nIt was just so stupid... like the writers had no fucking idea how to write for television, or a childrens menu...

The idea was that part of the avatar spirit ability went on to some one else and existed as sort of a sub avatar with only spiritual connections, this eventually lead to amon being this severed spirit demi avatar capable of spirit/energy bending (like how you see angg take away the fire lords bending at the end of the first season). The remaining the avatar abilities stayed with angg and because he was originally an air bender that wasnt a problem anyway and it never seemed like anything was lost.

I don\u2019t know how Tatiana Maslany does it, but she\u2019s absolutely amazing as every clone from Sarah, to Alison, to Helena, to Rachel, to Cosima to Krystal. As sad as it is that there\u2019s only one more season, it seems like it\u2019s a good time for it to come to the end. I want to see where everything goes in regards to the clones, especially Cosima and Rachel. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s back but I can\u2019t wait for what no doubt is going to be an amazing season. \n\n**Arrested Development** S02E11-S02E15: Funny as usual. Nothing that necessarily stood out to me, but it\u2019s definitely up there with Community and Silicon Valley  personally. Gob is definitely a favourite at this point, along with George Michael and Michael. \n\n**Designated Survivor** S01E07: I don\u2019t know what to think here. It\u2019s alright, in the sense that I wouldn\u2019t call it bad television, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t call it great television. I think I\u2019m going to stick with it for a little while longer, at least for this season anyway, at the very least for Kiefer Sutherland and Kal Penn.\n\n**The Flash** S03E07: Great episode. Danielle Panabaker was amazing, and I love seeing Killer Frost, even though it seems that we won\u2019t be keeping her around for the time being. The Doctor Alchemy reveal, albeit predictable, was well done, and I want to see where this goes. Savitar seems like a compelling villain as well. I have limited knowledge on the Flash villains besides the Rogues, but he seems interesting. I haven\u2019t got to the crossover yet, but I have no doubt that it\u2019ll be great. We\u2019re nearing the midseason finale, so I\u2019m expecting someone to die or something significant to happen, but we\u2019ll see. \n\n**Luther** S04E01-S04E02: Not the best season, but certainly enjoyable. Rose Leslie was an enjoyable addition to the season, although it certainly suffered  from the lack of Alice and Ripley. I don\u2019t know if they have any more plans for another season, but if they do I feel like they\u2019ll have to bring Alice back, or have it be the search for her. \n\n**Agent Carter** S01E01-S01E08: Should have watched this when it aired. Hayley Atwell is great in it, and her and Jarvis are a welcome duo. Certainly should have got more seasons, especially if the quality keeps up in the second season. Hopefully she comes back in some capacity, even though it\u2019s unlikely that that\u2019ll happen. Look forward to watching the second season in the coming weeks.\n\n**Sherlock** S01E01-S01E02: Not much to say here really. Amazing show, both Cumberbatch and Freeman playing the characters perfectly. The first episode with the suicides was certainly better than the second with the Chinese smuggling, but they were both very enjoyable. With my weekly shows ending now I plan to catch up before the new season of Sherlock, and from what I\u2019ve heard it certainly won\u2019t disappoint.\n\n**Lucifer** S02E10: Absolutely amazing. With the first half of the season done, it\u2019s certainly been up there with Westworld, Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow as my favourite shows that I\u2019ve watched this quarter. Tom Ellis and Lauren German both absolutely killed it, and I\u2019m looking forward to it when it comes back, maybe more so than any other show right now. I\u2019m happy they kind of killed the procedural aspect in this episode, and although it was there a little, it didn\u2019t overtake it. Plus Maze. \n\n**Westworld** S01E09: Like I said above, one of my favourite shows this quarter. We got some more answers, but there\u2019s still so many loose ends to tie up. William took a turn, and at this point I think Logan may be the better guy of the two. Although Dolores is slightly confusing with everything that\u2019s going on, I can\u2019t wait to see what happens with her, William, Man in Black, and Ford next week.\n\n**Supergirl** S02E08: I enjoyed this episode, even though I spent a deal of it waiting for Barry and Cisco to crossover. Despite that it was enjoyable, and I\u2019m liking the way they\u2019re dealing with Mon-El and Kara, opposed to the way they dealt with her and Jimmy last season. Lena is turning out to be an interesting character, and all the character interactions have been great so far. This season has been vastly improved, and can\u2019t wait for it to come back.\n\n**Gotham** S03E11: Better episode than most. I don\u2019t think we necessarily needed all the Mario/Jim drama that we had this season, but it seems like a means to an end. The cliffhanger will obviously factor into Jim/Lee. Although it wasn\u2019t as good as some other shows I\u2019m looking forward to seeing where it goes and what villains are introduced. \n\n**Batman: The Animated Series** S01E26: One of the better episodes I\u2019d say so far. I haven\u2019t watched it recently, as I\u2019d much rather watch Arrested Development opposed to this. \n\n**Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.** S04E07: I didn\u2019t realize that it\u2019s been as long as it has been between episodes. I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d do that, but the episode was an enjoyable one. Ghost Rider is steadily becoming the best character on the show, and it\u2019ll be sad to see him go when he does. Now if only they go all the way and formally introduce Johnny Blaze.\n\n**Brooklyn Nine-Nine** S04E08: Enjoyable show. Not much to say. Terry is the best. \n"], [2, "Vikings is back!

Plus the ending was roughly what I thought it was going to be (not great).  I like a lot of these actors, but I'm not sure if I'd come back for a second season.\n\n**Westworld:** While I enjoy Westworld, I'm not as enamored with it as most people seem to be.  It does a great job at being mysterious, but, when you strip that away, I'm not sure I find the story that compelling.

That said, I'm looking forward to the season finale and have every intention of coming back for season 2.\n\n**Divorce:** I had low expectations for this show and have been pleasantly surprised at how funny it is.  I'm actually sort of surprised I haven't seen more people talking about it.

The drama is getting good and tense.\n\n**Planet Earth II** S01E03-04 - Jungles and Deserts weren't my favorites, but they both offered some interesting moments. It's been 10 years since I watched the first *Planet Earth* series, but I feel like I've seen some of this footage before. That locust swarm comes to mind.\n\n**Blindspot** S02E09 - Good mid-season finale leaving you to wonder who got shot?\n\n**Scorpion** S03E08 - Terrible plot, but that's a given with this series. This particular episode felt that like they had to stretch scenes out just to fill for time.\n\n**Horace and Pete** S01E06-10 - I would buy and watch this series each week when it debuted in the spring. Bank account ran a little dry and then other TV shows took priority. When I saw that Hulu had bought the rights to this show last month, it reminded me that I needed to finish it, so I went and bought the remaining episodes. This show was very timely when it was released. Dialogue would be about events that had happened the day before, so I missed that by watching these last 5 episodes 7 months after they aired. The plot and characters were all great, though. This was a really phenomenal series. Episode 1 threw me off, but once I understood that I was literally watching a play on television rather than a standard TV show, I was hooked.\n\n**Westworld** S01E09 - Probably the best episode of the season. I wish I could say I fully understood Delores' constant wardrobe changes or why the church village was finally shown, but I'm still totally enthralled in it all.\n\n**The Walking Dead** S07E06 - I like Tara, but not a whole episode's worth of her, especially when you have such an interesting character like Negan out there just being wasted away.\n\n**Talking Dead** S06E06 - I would have never guessed that Cassandra Peterson transforms herself into Elvira. The 2 look vastly different.\n\n**Vice News Tonight** S01E31-32 - My nightly news source is back after taking the week of Thanksgiving off.\n\n**Eyewitness** S01E06-07 - Got all caught up again with this.

I don\u2019t know how Tatiana Maslany does it, but she\u2019s absolutely amazing as every clone from Sarah, to Alison, to Helena, to Rachel, to Cosima to Krystal. As sad as it is that there\u2019s only one more season, it seems like it\u2019s a good time for it to come to the end. I want to see where everything goes in regards to the clones, especially Cosima and Rachel. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s back but I can\u2019t wait for what no doubt is going to be an amazing season. \n\n**Arrested Development** S02E11-S02E15: Funny as usual. Nothing that necessarily stood out to me, but it\u2019s definitely up there with Community and Silicon Valley  personally. Gob is definitely a favourite at this point, along with George Michael and Michael. \n\n**Designated Survivor** S01E07: I don\u2019t know what to think here. It\u2019s alright, in the sense that I wouldn\u2019t call it bad television, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t call it great television. I think I\u2019m going to stick with it for a little while longer, at least for this season anyway, at the very least for Kiefer Sutherland and Kal Penn.\n\n**The Flash** S03E07: Great episode. Danielle Panabaker was amazing, and I love seeing Killer Frost, even though it seems that we won\u2019t be keeping her around for the time being. The Doctor Alchemy reveal, albeit predictable, was well done, and I want to see where this goes. Savitar seems like a compelling villain as well. I have limited knowledge on the Flash villains besides the Rogues, but he seems interesting. I haven\u2019t got to the crossover yet, but I have no doubt that it\u2019ll be great. We\u2019re nearing the midseason finale, so I\u2019m expecting someone to die or something significant to happen, but we\u2019ll see. \n\n**Luther** S04E01-S04E02: Not the best season, but certainly enjoyable. Rose Leslie was an enjoyable addition to the season, although it certainly suffered  from the lack of Alice and Ripley. I don\u2019t know if they have any more plans for another season, but if they do I feel like they\u2019ll have to bring Alice back, or have it be the search for her. \n\n**Agent Carter** S01E01-S01E08: Should have watched this when it aired. Hayley Atwell is great in it, and her and Jarvis are a welcome duo. Certainly should have got more seasons, especially if the quality keeps up in the second season. Hopefully she comes back in some capacity, even though it\u2019s unlikely that that\u2019ll happen. Look forward to watching the second season in the coming weeks.\n\n**Sherlock** S01E01-S01E02: Not much to say here really. Amazing show, both Cumberbatch and Freeman playing the characters perfectly. The first episode with the suicides was certainly better than the second with the Chinese smuggling, but they were both very enjoyable. With my weekly shows ending now I plan to catch up before the new season of Sherlock, and from what I\u2019ve heard it certainly won\u2019t disappoint.\n\n**Lucifer** S02E10: Absolutely amazing. With the first half of the season done, it\u2019s certainly been up there with Westworld, Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow as my favourite shows that I\u2019ve watched this quarter. Tom Ellis and Lauren German both absolutely killed it, and I\u2019m looking forward to it when it comes back, maybe more so than any other show right now. I\u2019m happy they kind of killed the procedural aspect in this episode, and although it was there a little, it didn\u2019t overtake it. Plus Maze. \n\n**Westworld** S01E09: Like I said above, one of my favourite shows this quarter. We got some more answers, but there\u2019s still so many loose ends to tie up. William took a turn, and at this point I think Logan may be the better guy of the two. Although Dolores is slightly confusing with everything that\u2019s going on, I can\u2019t wait to see what happens with her, William, Man in Black, and Ford next week.\n\n**Supergirl** S02E08: I enjoyed this episode, even though I spent a deal of it waiting for Barry and Cisco to crossover. Despite that it was enjoyable, and I\u2019m liking the way they\u2019re dealing with Mon-El and Kara, opposed to the way they dealt with her and Jimmy last season. Lena is turning out to be an interesting character, and all the character interactions have been great so far. This season has been vastly improved, and can\u2019t wait for it to come back.\n\n**Gotham** S03E11: Better episode than most. I don\u2019t think we necessarily needed all the Mario/Jim drama that we had this season, but it seems like a means to an end. The cliffhanger will obviously factor into Jim/Lee. Although it wasn\u2019t as good as some other shows I\u2019m looking forward to seeing where it goes and what villains are introduced. \n\n**Batman: The Animated Series** S01E26: One of the better episodes I\u2019d say so far. I haven\u2019t watched it recently, as I\u2019d much rather watch Arrested Development opposed to this. \n\n**Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.** S04E07: I didn\u2019t realize that it\u2019s been as long as it has been between episodes. I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d do that, but the episode was an enjoyable one. Ghost Rider is steadily becoming the best character on the show, and it\u2019ll be sad to see him go when he does. Now if only they go all the way and formally introduce Johnny Blaze.\n\n**Brooklyn Nine-Nine** S04E08: Enjoyable show. Not much to say.

The actual subject matter is the inner workings of an amusement park in turmoil... corporate espionage and malfunctioning robots.  There's nothing wrong with any of that, but it's material that I've seen covered elsewhere plenty of times (including the movies that this show is based on).  Otherwise, the writers seem primarily concerned with being as cryptic as possible, and those types of shows don't always turn out so well.  Don't get me wrong: I've enjoyed the show so far.  I'm just not convinced I see them keeping up the mystery act for eight seasons.", "id": "damxdbv"}, {"comment": "You're focusing on the mystery part and the storytelling mechanics but there is a lot more going on.\n\nStorytelling makes you ask questions and wait to have them answered (so of course there is an element of mystery). It presents the info in a way that gets you to buy into the setting, learn about the characters, develop the themes and then reveals truths that cause you to reevaluate what you thought you knew and apply that to the real world at the end. \n\nA very basic Game of thrones take would be that it gets you to accept a medieval type setting, begin to see who is good and evil, you get to watch good and evil clash, then you find out even sometimes evil wins and now you can take that back to the real world. It also breaks a lot of shitty storytelling tropes so you don't just coast through the show, you have to watch the details and soak in more of the messages the author throws out within the smaller storylines- it moves beyond the larger plot and spawns more discussions than the basic \"will Geoffrey die next episode\" to \"Ned's idealism destroyed his family so what does that mean for morality at large if doing the moral thing can cause such major problems\" (or what have you)\n\nWestworld doesn't have the density of characters or gigantic world as GoT but it has the same \"larger than the story\" elements. We bought into the world and are watching everything that was a given at the beginning change and that alters the way we feel about the themes we are presented. The hosts are becoming sentient but are still getting raped and killed, what does that mean about the guests? What does that mean about humans and these violent, primitive tendencies if the ultimate solution to venting them isn't any different from actually doing them in real life? But we aren't just asking these questions in a sterile environment, we are watching them arise and FEELING the answers come out of our reactions in real time. \n\nSo it's not the mystery of \"what's going to happen to Dolores\" or \"are there hosts within the company\" that is keeping everyone engrossed, it's watching these important themes clash together and trying to find meaning out of it within our own context.\n\nPlus the bicameral mind ideas are fascinating and we get to watch a great demonstration of that play out in front of us.\n\n", "id": "dan7lli"}, {"comment": "I get that it's also asking questions about human nature.

Episode plots are just a loose context for jokes, and the jokes are very rapid but usually low-effort. How good any given episode is just comes down to what percentage of the jokes landed this time, so you can have a really strong episode immediately followed by an absolutely terrible one. I think this is also why you tend to see tons of people who say they casually watch Family Guy but almost no one who really loves it or would buy the DVDs. \n\nAmerican Dad and The Simpsons, by comparison, have much more effort put into the episode stories, and tend to make fewer but higher-effort jokes. This means that -- even if you think The Simpsons isn't worth watching anymore -- they feel much more consistent and they're more likely to have fans who tune in regularly or watch every episode. \n\nI personally agree with you; The Simpsons is good about half the time, and has a few really strong episodes each season. I don't think The Simpsons is as bad as many do, IMO it just suffers from comparisons to its early years. It went from being one of the greatest comedies ever produced to simply being a solid enjoyable one. I still like watching it, and if the show had *started* at season 14 I think most people would call it a decent to good show. It's just that its first 10 seasons or so managed to combine the two approaches -- they were so dense with rapid-fire jokes, but somehow every single joke was also perfectly polished and timed and delivered *and* delivered in the context of an engaging story. The show's a victim of its own former glory.\n\nI often wonder how Family Guy would be if it had 10-episode seasons, and could limit themselves to only their best jokes and ideas.

For all their (valid) criticism of Family Guy as being written by manatees nudging random balls around, it felt like South Park was/is written by some algorithm that took random newspaper headlines and mashed them up with random UrbanDictionary entries. In discussions for many new entries you see people guessing how South Park will incorporate this story into the show and what they'll mash it up with, and more than a few times they've been right -- that's kind of a bad sign IMO. \n\nI still remember when the show was at its peak of popularity -- that's almost 20 years ago now! -- when the movie was coming out, stores were full of South Park merchandise, kids were everywhere in SP hats and backpacks, the first videogames were topsellers, etc. South Park had a reputation for being gutsy and bold and irreverent and unpredictably weird, for making everything else on TV (especially animated shows on TV) look like tired dull stuffy 80s throwbacks. And now it's the opposite, it's South Park that feels stuffy and tired, formulaic, every episode building to a predictable political lecture, acting like it's presenting some deep message. South Park Season 20 feels like exactly the sort of show that South Park Season 5 would have taken the piss out of. They do lampshade it (from the Family Guy episode: \"at least it doesn't get all up its own ass with messages\"), but admitting your flaws doesn't fix them.\n\nBut that's just me, not claiming to make some objective assessment of its quality. And I do recognise that they couldn't have stuck with their original style forever -- you can't be the gutsy fresh iconoclast after 20 years topping the charts, so they had to switch to *something*.

When you think about a lot of the plots and dialogue in comics and translating them to the either the small screen or the big screen, there is a helluva lot to keep up with.  Make sure everyone gets lines, screen time and a time to shine, keep the plot understandable from a third grade level (yet interesting enough to appeal to those with higher education), get the CG's scheduled in plenty of time to put in the live shots, throw in as many cultural and meta references for the true fans as you can fit, get all the shooting locations locked down with good weather, make sure that the x-over episode maintains the continuity with the current series, fill up as much of 4 episodes as possible, oh and celebrate Arrow's 100th episode with a huge helping of fan service.  Even Wolf Films has only done a 3-series crossover between their Law & Order shows and their Chicago shows.  And you can say that the Supergirl episode wasn't a full crossover episode, but that follows the form of a lot of comics story arcs, where the guest hero shows up on the last couple of pages of the issue to kick things off.\n\nCongrats to the CW, Berlanti Productions, DC Entertainment and Warner Bros.

He wanted to be in control, and Gus calling the shots was an issue on principle.\n\nperhaps he enjoyed the power over jesse, and a diety like status by keeping someone so... ignorant, around.

Jesse also has so far proven to have been able to be useful despite his addiction and to keep Walt's secrets such as killing and disposing of Krazy-8 and Emilio.  There's also the fact that Walt really does care for Jesse whether it's because he feels that Jesse is becoming like a son he has to watch out for or even just as a student he still has to teach.  In any case I don't think it comes down to a rational decision.  In a lot of ways it is highly irrational.

Jesse was Walt's wild card for all to see, a dog that isn't on a leash and only answers to him.  Walt is truly a monster to Jesse and considers himself like a God to him.  \n  \nHe wants Jesse around, more than anything else, because Jesse makes things unpredictable for Walt even when its inconvenient or dangerous.  Walt really is one of the smartest guys around, but his God complex makes his life boring.

On top of that Walt is not going to let this drug kingpin dictate what is good for Walt. He alone decides what he does and how, because once again, it all ties back to Walt's insatiable need for power. Even though he knows Gus is right, he puts his foot down and establishes his position.\n\nThese very real human emotions are not out of the realm of reality. They are very much there, some carry it on their sleeve more than others, and for them it is logical to assert themselves for power.

It made mistakes with less fun/confident Barry which then turned into overconfident Barry for an episode and balanced for the remaining handful of episodes. It was nice. \n\nSeason 3 Flash, forgotten who it is entirely. Caitlin should be pissed. She got powers because Barry fucked up the timeline, and caused her to get them and will probably eventually make her go dark side. That's a pretty damned good reason to be pissed at him, but isn't.\n\nCisco I get where he's coming from, Barry caused Dante to die. That's fine. But if you want to add another dimension to his character don't take away his rationality. Don't have him basically announce to everyone that Barry is keeping something from him. I get why he's hurt that Barry (and Caitlin!) kept why his brother died from him. I get why that would hurt almost as much as his brother dying, period. That's fine, just don't ruin his character because right now Cisco looks more petty. He's still contributing to the team just some of his stuff is questionable. That alone is totally fine. \n\nWally with powers? I get that he has them and wants to use them. But he of all people should know why everyone wants him to wait. He was the guy that knew Barry wasn't perfect and called him out on it despite everyone else praising him constantly. He knows Barry fucks up and could die at anytime.

I get wanting to keep him safe but it seems like they just want to stifle his powers entirely. \n\nYeah in a weird I like how they've handled Caitlin.

I don't think that Barry had anything to with their arrival, the recording seems for a different event (I'm assuming involving Reverse Flash). So the blame being thrown at him right now seems weird. \n\nEdit: I also find it weird how the Legends crew are getting on Barry's case for saving his mother, sure none of them have tried to make a personal change like that, but it doesn't stop them from saving a village in the old west from being burnt down like it was historically meant too.", "id": "danwt3i"}, {"comment": "I like your idea but would love if he went to supergirl.

Further, a spill could impact the waters that the Tribe and individual tribal members residing in that area rely upon for drinking and other purposes.

Tomi did make a good point- it's everyone between the coasts, the working class who feel disenfranchised and dismissed. Coming from a working class town, I can tell you first-hand that they don't care much for politics on the whole. And Trump tapped into that. I still maintain that was nothing but a sales pitch, ironically no different a tactic than any other politician, but the working class bought into Trump, to his credit. For a billionaire who owns the plane he flies in and sleeps in a high-rise with his name on it in big gold letters, to appeal to a population of honest, hard-working, yet low-earning people is mind-boggling. It was probably the red trucker hat.\n\nThe problem I see is that the United States presidency IS politics. And it is arguably the most powerful job in the world. And people who hate politics just made the most important political decision of this country-- they made Donald Trump the leader of the place in which they live, out of pure spite, regardless of flip-flopping policy stances or concrete racist and sexist tendencies. He is not leadership material, and that's exactly why they chose him. We have attempted national suicide, and we're waiting to see if the fall kills us.\n\nThe worst part of all is: ask the same working class people who voted for Trump 6 months from now if they're following what's going on in Washington D.C. and I guarantee most won't be able to even tell you who the Secretary of State is.

By next week he could announce he's gonna be King Donald and with how unpredictable the last year has been I almost wouldn't be surprised.

My opinion is that this country is largely made up of the working class and the disenfranchised (a point that Tomi made, and I have to agree with her there, as shitty as that makes me feel). Those people are maybe not the most politically knowledgeable. They just know their own hardships. And so, they look to the loudest mouth that speaks to their fears, no matter how unqualified that person may be to do so. Therefore, they gravitate to Tomi's Facebook videos, and outlets like Fox News, and they vote for a billionaire in Donald Trump, though he has literally nothing in common with working class folk AT ALL. (Neither does Hillary Clinton, but unfortunately she didn't play to the working class as hard as he did.) I know veterans who voted for Trump even after what he said about John McCain and POWs. I know women who voted for Trump even after years of documented sexism and alleged sexual abuse. I know Filipinos whose parents were illegal immigrants that voted for Trump. But Trump played on every working class person's problems and fears like a piano.\n\nFor the record, I don't like Donald Trump at all. Regardless of how I feel about Hillary Clinton (don't care much for her, it was supposed to be Bernie anyway), she is still better suited to be president than Trump, by miles.

It seems so obvious, especially with the flip-flopping choices he's made since winning the election. He is a BUSINESSMAN. And he played to the room just like any other politician.

Sure a lot of that is Rothfuss fulfilling some weird fantasy he has but it's not unbelievable in the least. Same with him turning into an amazing fighter. It doesn't take that much training to seem amazing to the average person. These bandits he fights have probably been around weapons before and have the general idea right: Hit 'em with the sharp part. But when you take that against a person with some basic training you get killed pretty easily.\n\nThe only really special things he does after 2 books are to create a very valuable piece of machinery which he spent months working on and to compose crazy beautiful songs while in a period of intense pain and grief. Everything else was just implementing basic and intermediate training to blow the minds of the average person, who is illiterate and won't travel more than probably 10 miles from where they were born in their entire lifetime.", "id": "dalhr2q"}, {"comment": "He was never an amazing fighter he was very average.

The average fighter is some guard on a merchant's wagon or a random bandit. Just minor training means that 90% of all those bandits pose a small threat to his life in a 1 on 1 situation instead of a significant threat. Which is amazing to the average person who has a very high chance of dying if a bandit decides to rob them.\n\nThe main point is to take things into the perspective they are given in. Rothfuss' world isn't full of blade masters and people having ancient blood that gives them amazing fighting capabilities like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time.

Goes out of his way to make sure he isn't flirting with her the way her other suitors do, because he values her friendship. Some people can't see past the \"WELL WE KNOW HE LOVES HER, SHE MUST BE SUPER CRUEL JERKING HIM AROUND\", but like, there's literally a point where she's drugged up and dreamily complains about how she wishes he were interested in her but she's sure he isn't. They're teenagers, doing the very teenaged thing of being so afraid of their crush that they convince themselves there's no interest, even though said interest may seem obvious to someone who's in the know. I'm so grumpy with people who hate her, it's pretty damn sexist.\n\nAnyways, I'm a woman, and I can be sensitive to how women are portrayed (recently been reading Jack McDevitt and his obsession with describing women's looks is really grating), and I love the series.

Nothing about the love interest or how women are portrayed bothered me- and I'm a woman so hopefully I'd be able to catch if we were getting a bad deal.

I always thought his novels were so close to greatness. He was a world class storyteller and world builder, and so I thought he nailed it when he went off into these Neil Gaiman style diversions into the fantastical folklore of his world. Sadly, he had a habit of writing really fucking horrible characters, and his control of the narrative evaporated in the second book to the point that we spent hundreds of pages without moving any major plot arcs.

Then when Chris \"shuffles\" at the beginning he always keeps the top cards on the top (his right hand in the shuffle). So he knew it was 4,4, AofH on the top. \n\n3.

Will was probably actually supposed to shuffle 4 times, but apparently has never touched a deck of cards before.

He moves the cards around a bit because he needs to distract from the sleight of hand at some point to hide the AoH for the end of the trick.

The 4 failed attempts at finding the card are to add to the comedy, that we all think he's a goof and clearly if the pile of 4 didn't have Will's card before, why would it suddenly appear.\n\n8.

I know this isn't a politically correct thing to say but in New York, statistically, blacks commit more crimes (i'm not suggesting it's in their blood or anything heinous like that, there are cultural and socioeconomically reasons why that's the case) so are more likely to be affected but not necessarily targeted (which could happen). Blacks were 2/3 of all violent-crime suspects based on witnesses to those crimes.  70% of all robberies, 80% of gun crimes in 2011. I think the real issue when it comes to stop-and-frisk is when police officers make unlawful stops. The research that the judge that said that stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional (that helped it getting completely stopped) said that it found that 6% of police stops were unlawful, of course the number isn't completely accurate. But there's no proof that just because a large amount of black people get stopped for it doesn't mean it's being completely abused or was designed to target minorities. It just happens to have a larger effect on them. Crime has actually went up since they stopped doing it too, nobody really denies that the system works, there have been thousands of weapons confiscated due to these stops each year. \n\n\nTrump is a big supporter of charter schools and school vouchers which have shown a lot of success with black students.

The Urban League had sent black and white testers to apply for apartments in Trump-owned complexes; the whites got the apartments, the blacks did not. According to court records, four superintendents or rental agents reported that applications sent to the central office for acceptance or rejection were coded by race. A 1979 Village Voice article quoted a rental agent who said Trump instructed him not to rent to black people and to encourage existing black tenants to leave.\"\n\n", "id": "daln455"}, {"comment": "That excerpt doesn't disprove what I said. Trump has never said or suggested anything about doing anything negative to blacks [if elected]. \n\n\nBut, I'll bite on that excerpt anyways. I think there's a big difference between actions based off prejudices that are racially discriminatory vs. being an actual true racist. One is making unfair and discriminatory decisions based on racial stereotypes  and the other is actually believing that races are inherently inferior or bad. We don't really have proof of the latter. The former only, being still bad, doesn't mean that he's likely going to oppress an entire race. Not everyone who refuses to rent to black tenants or who walks on the other side of the street when there's a black guy in a hoodie (e.g. Mark Cuban) hates all black people, they are just unfairly basing certain actions on a racial stereotype.\n\n\nSomething worth noting is when this took place, which was over 45 years ago. The reason that it's worth nothing is because the Civil Rights movement was still going on or had just finished and there's a reason that existed. People were said to be more racist back then and it has arguably been the strides of the Civil rights movement and the progressive media that has shifted peoples views. So lets say maybe he was a true racist back then, maybe he isn't anymore? I don't know. You don't know.

Though for almost any word there are many definitions but my main point acting on prejudices isn't as evil and should be distinguished with the belief of racial superiority of a particular race and inherent inferiority (or evilness) of another. You could be a true racist and still perform actions based on prejudice but not everyone who has performed discriminatory actions is a true evil racist. People admit to walking on the other street in poorer neighbour hoods when there's a black guy, I'm not saying it's something good but if those same people were to see a black guy in a richer neighbourhood or had a black doctor they wouldn't be thinking \"oh great an n-word\" or be avoiding them. A person who only performs discriminatory actions is more likely to fix the problems that causes this prejudice which is high crime in the black community and a person who is a true racist would more likely try to kick out or take away rights just because they think blacks are inferior/bad. Again, we have no proof of the latter. \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't think at all he should be president.

People will defend him saying that he is a comedian and he is being satirical but, actually, this past season on the election revealed he is a propagandist for one party and focusing all his energy on something like Trump U while giving cover to far more sinister things like the Foundation is a deliberate distortion of the truth.  \n", "id": "dalv9sx"}], [{"comment": "theres nothing finer than watching democrats whining about trump. they are the reason trump is the next president. you create a sesspool, and your surprised when a slimy lizard emerges from it?", "id": "dalxnuy"}, {"comment": "Democrats created the cesspool?

Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson (while it's a show I have an appreciation for) uses punk music in a bit of a shallow way.

The Washington Post has called Hamilton [the end of irony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2015/09/21/hamilton-and-the-end-of-irony/) because its use of rap music and its modern retelling of history is a genuinely moving mechanism that enhances the story. BBAJ, again a show I enjoy, is all about irony. the first line of the show being \"Why wouldn't you ever go out with me in school?\" is not meant to be taken seriously and it continues from there.\n\nAgain, I think LMM's contribution is in clever lyrics and wordplay and attaching rap to the musical theatre genre. \"I\u2019m in the cabinet.

A lot of the dialogue  in those scenes actually made me cringe, as a gay man myself, and the Wachowski's definitely used it to offload some emotional baggage IMHO and it shows. \n\n2. In trying to include so many social issues in the show, it managed to only scrape the surface of most of them and it made it feel superficial to me. Almost doing more harm than good IMO from broad generilizations and face-palm-worthy scenarios that feel way too unnatural to feel emotional connection to. \n\n3. Rather juvenile sex scenes. There is having a sex scene because it is important to the plot, or expands on characters in some way, and then there is just softcore porn. This felt way closer to the latter and was just unnecessary.  \n\nThose are my personal issues with it. Also the acting is all over the place quality wise.

Only a couple of the storylines dealt with the major questions of the series (the overarching plot, if you like) so in one episode there might be a major revelation and the series feels like it's building up to something... and the next episode will be about something totally unrelated, that feels petty in comparison. \n\nIn addition, the storylines were so disparate that they're unlikely to all appeal to the same person - you might go from a high speed car chase in Africa in one episode, to a woman struggling to come to terms with her arranged marriage in India in the next. So as a viewer, it feels like you're bouncing all over the place and getting whiplash, and you're almost guaranteed to dislike entire segments of the show which revolve around the storylines you're not really interested in. \n\nThat said, I think that as everything started to come together and overlap in the last few episodes many of these issues got a lot better.

Specifically *Cloud Atlas* or *Speed Racer*?\n\nThen you will like it. It's the same super-earnest, no-cynicism, excellent choreography, cool action, uncomplicated heroes, and very basic theme that makes up the Wachowski's stuff. I mean *Cloud Atlas* was a movie about \"being kind and good is important\" but it really believed that more than any movie I've ever seen possibly. Likewise *Sense8* is \"empathy is good, have empathy you idiots\" and believes that really hard.\n\nI love that style. Many other people do as well. It grates a lot of other people as \"corny\" though. (I would argue what makes the Wachowski's stuff work is that even though their protagonists are always uncomplicated heroes and their messages are super basic, they don't always win and bad stuff still happens, good doesn't always win.)\n\nAlso there's like four characters in the show that are gay and one transgender woman (keep in mind this is an ensemble cast so those characters still only make up like 25 percent of the cast).

I'd have to do it all over again 4 times a year or 3 times or whatever it is. Meanwhile I massively increase the chances of spoiling something for myself. I'm already always searching for other shows to fill the gaps. "], [3, "I've been doing it this way for 8 years now, ever since I ditched cable. I take it a bit further now -- I sometimes won't even watch a show until it's completed several seasons.

So I wait for a show to demonstrate that therected is some king of coherent story going on before I dive in."], [3, "I'm currently doing this with a few shows and it is way better than waiting week to week and dealing with random breaks and the midseason break (sometimes two or three months depending onthe show).

Going week to week means you are watching on appointment viewing and scheduling your life around a tv show considering the level of DVR and streaming technology seems really dumb. Also, you have to deal with the breaks as you stated. \n\nSo now I basically start the network shows that I care about in the summer after the season ends and being them at my leisure. \n\nIn a lot of ways I feel like the current formats are a holdover from a time where tv watching meant something different in a societal way than it does now and tv networks and creators need to find ways to adapt."], [4, "Dude, you are watching television 90s style. That is no longer feasible now that most new shows average around 12-15 episodes per season instead of the regular 22 episodes we are used to.

Ever since streaming became big, I haven't even turned on our satellite TV."], [3, "I used to be an \"every week-every episode\" kind of TV-watcher. Now, I find myself far too busy with life to keep to a TV schedule so, every couple of weeks, I find myself streaming 4-5 episodes of a show at a time over weekends when I have some free time.

It was worth it because huge character archs, but damn what a chore.\n\nNow, that said, I think The Walking Dead has a problem other intense shows are going to have at some point. Game of Thrones, even. When things get epic, they are **epic**. Fans enjoy those epic moments. The problem here is you can't pack that much epic without the character development. And this leads to problems like the current rating drop or the farm season. The last season of TWD (the one on netflix now, not tv), was action packed out the gate and didn't really ever calm down. All the protagonists were on their A Game and the group were succeeding at everything.\n\nThat momentum has to crash at some point and TWD is the kind of show where the group cannot be impenetrable. They have to get knocked down and suffer, so that the epic moments are **epic**. The problem lies in how it's written when they're down. There has to be some sort of redemption intensity.

It's semi-serialized in that there are overall plot arcs, especially in the later seasons, but for the most part almost any given episode is stand-alone. There are some one-off villains/situations, others are recurring. It's sometimes a bit campy, and it relies on a lot of the well-worn tropes of simple science fiction like how everyone speaks modern English, but it's also at least relatively good about being consistent with its own internal rules. \n\nThe first seasons is probably by far the worst for camp and bad writing. The pilot and the first regular length episode (\"The Enemy Within\") are excellent, but after that the going gets rough for awhile. \n\nIncidentally, if you are into serious high quality sci-fi, you should check out The Expanse.

And yeah. more like Firefly. It is a fun show too. "], [3, "Alright, let's break this down.\n\n* You do not need to watch the Stargate movie. In fact, as a fellow lover of sci-fi, I would recommend you do not. The characters are played by completely different actors and it can be jarring making that transition. I'd only watch it if you really feel compelled to. The TV show introduces the concept of the Stargates well enough.\n* Based on your TV preferences, I think you'll enjoy SG: Atlantis the most, followed by SG-1 and then SG:Universe. \n* If you enjoy some cheesy, but witty writing along with good acting and cultural exploration, SG-1 is your go-to show. There is an over-arching plot that runs through the majority of the seasons and the historical detail can be quite interesting at times. The focus here is on the *characters* though, which is a good thing. The show hits a really great stride from Seasons 3-7, has some character lead changes in seasons 9-10, but is overall quite good. \n* SG: Atlantis still has the witty writing, as well as better special effects, but is also grounded with a seriousness of their situation. Again, the focus here is on characters, not story. The villains here are not particularly fleshed out, but the cast of Atlantis has a lot more problems to face than just their main adversaries (a lot of times the city itself presents the problems). To me, this show is the closest to Firefly (balancing that witty/serious tone) and is my personal favorite.\n* SG:U is, in my opinion, the worst of the three. I would give it a decent review compared to the others. The focus here is more on plot than character and things are substantially slow-moving in season 1 (think glacial pace). It has a much more serious tone than the other two because SyFy was trying to cash in on the Battlestar Galactica hype. I think it missed the boat, personally, but there are some who love it dearly. \n\nFinally, I noticed you did not list Battlestar Galactica (2003-2007) on your list of viewed shows. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it to you. It ranks in the realm of Lost/Westworld in terms of story/acting/writing/special effects.

It also has an amazing 200th episode, possibly the best episode of the entire series (although some fans hate it).\n\nAlso since we are commenting, watch SGAtlantis at the same time (they run alongside eachother and have some crossover, altho I'm not sure exactly when).

"], [1, "yes"], [1, "Just don't let the movie scare you off, I only watch the first half."], [1, "I say watch SG1. It's a classic series that will keep you glued to the screen as time goes on. The cast of characters mesh well and play off perfectly with one another, the stories are pretty good although they are a bit weak as is the writing in Season 1. Before you know it, you'll be hooked and binging them pretty quickly.\n\nAs for the movie, it's kinda split down the middle in terms of the popularity. I suggest watching it, or, at the very least watch the first half and then kinda skip around till you see the end.\n\nThe movie will set up the characters (even though different actors play them in the show) and Jack O'Neill (Two L's!) goes through a bit of a change. In the movie, played by Kurt Russel, he's very serious after a certain incident I won't mention here.  He's down, depressed, angry and just doesn't give a real shit about anything.\n\nIn the show, it continues with RDA (Richard Dean Anderson of McGuyver fame) taking the lead roll, however he is a bit lighter and as the series progresses, he becomes sort of a goof who just doesn't care. But in a likeable and good way.\n\nThe movie will set everything up and have more impact when you watch the show - is it necessary? Probably not. But it doesn't hurt and may make the show for a better watch.\n\nStargate Atlantis picks up using Season 7's ending of SG1 to begin its show. If you watch them back to back, (which you won't have to as they do very little tie ins but there are a few) SG1 Season 8 and SGA (Atlantis) Season 1 are the correct order there.\n\nAtlantis was ran by the same creators and writers so you will see a lot of similarities in the Atlantis' productions. You will also be introduced to probably one of the best characters since RDA's Col. Jack O'Neill (Still two L's!) - Doctor McKay. In fact almost the entire cast is likeable and you'll most likely end up binge watching this one as well.\n\nNow, my take on Stargate Universe; the show was dark. Very dark. It was a change of form for the series Stargate as a whole. Whereas SG1 had a light hearted tone and comedy but knew when to be serious and dramatic, with Atlantis following suit, Universe was drastically dark with less of the comedy and lightheartedness tones that the franchise was known for.\n\nI believe this in part, turned off a lot of fans to the show as a whole, adding to its cancellation. Personally, I could not get into it. It was too much of a change, I didn't care for any of the characters despite some grade A acting by the cast, and a wonderful cast it is. But it wasn't quite what I was looking for.\n\nHowever, Universe is also a bit more in tone with that of Westworld or even some parts of Lost. You may enjoy it much more than I did.\n\nIf you decide to give them a check;\n\nStargate (movie - at least watch the first half and maybe the end)\n\nStargate (SG1) Seasons 1-10 and two made for tv movies to close the series.\n\nStargate Atlantis (SGA) Start at Season 8 of SG1 or just watch it after you finish SG1. Your call.\n\nStargate Universe (SGU) Doesn't hurt to give it a try."], [1, "You should watch **Stargate Universe**. It is closer to Battlestar Galactica or Lost whereas the rest of Stargate is more serialized (while still having overarching stories). Don't get me wrong, SG-1 is absolutely enjoyable (and most people say it is the better series) but just from what you've stated you might enjoy SGU more. And personally I love SGU, though I will admit that it sometimes focuses on drama over science fiction/the overarching plot and many of the the characters are unlikable at times (though I'd argue you could say the same thing about BSG). It is available on Amazon Prime in the US I believe. \n\n[Original trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HyD3aKFTkA)\n\nFor those who say they'll never watch the show, here are some spoilery trailers from halfway through the first season and beyond:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6HvUGXjNnc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NbBcLf1-jA"], [1, "Indeed!

Atlantis was a much better show near the end of SG1, but apparently the network didn't see it that way and decided to keep SG1 going. I'm not saying the last eps of SG1 were bad, they just weren't anything near the first 5-6 seasons. Atlantis was awesome the entire way through, they should have totally kept it going or at least a final movie to wrap things up a bit better. I'm not trying to get into the plot very much here so I don't spoil anything for you, but you should definitely watch it.\n\nAlso, there is Stargate: Universe. I didn't like it at first because I found it to be a blatant rip off of BSG when it comes to things like the camera movements (mostly in space stuff) and one of the enemies they ended up fighting were quite similar to the Cylons, as well as other factors I'm not gonna get into since it probably requires spoilers and there's really no point.  However I rewatched it twice since I saw it when it aired and liked it a bit more the second time, and a lot more the third time. I was originally not sad at all that they cut it short. but I definitely wish they kept going after the last rewatch. They didn't even wrap up the story of the ship's main mission. \n\nWatch them all ASAP! They were all amazing. I am assuming you've seen the original movie, correct? The series kicks the shit out of it, but it wouldn't exist without the original film. The actors are WAY better in the show, RDA kicks so much ass and I loved seeing him in a modern show. He was always a super badass mofo in my eyes. "], [1, "SG-1 is pulpy fun. It rarely explores anything too deep but, it does not take itself too seriously and is a fun show to watch."], [1, "One thing I didn't see mentioned is that technology in the show is serialized for the most part. So as the show progresses technology that showed up in one season as an alien doodad can end up getting integrated into the human arsenal later on.  The Stargate team progresses technologically as the seasons progress. It's one of those things that just isn't as common in episodic sci-fi as it should be.   \n\nAlso familiarize yourself with the term \"lampshade hanging\". The shows do it. A lot. But not in a bad way. It's part of the charm of their charm. "], [1, "The wife and I really enjoyed it (enough to buy all the seasons on DVD).

In fact, as a fellow lover of sci-fi, I would recommend you do not. The characters are played by completely different actors and it can be jarring making that transition. I'd only watch it if you really feel compelled to. The TV show introduces the concept of the Stargates well enough.\n* Based on your TV preferences, I think you'll enjoy SG: Atlantis the most, followed by SG-1 and then SG:Universe. \n* If you enjoy some cheesy, but witty writing along with good acting and cultural exploration, SG-1 is your go-to show. There is an over-arching plot that runs through the majority of the seasons and the historical detail can be quite interesting at times. The focus here is on the *characters* though, which is a good thing. The show hits a really great stride from Seasons 3-7, has some character lead changes in seasons 9-10, but is overall quite good. \n* SG: Atlantis still has the witty writing, as well as better special effects, but is also grounded with a seriousness of their situation. Again, the focus here is on characters, not story. The villains here are not particularly fleshed out, but the cast of Atlantis has a lot more problems to face than just their main adversaries (a lot of times the city itself presents the problems). To me, this show is the closest to Firefly (balancing that witty/serious tone) and is my personal favorite.\n* SG:U is, in my opinion, the worst of the three. I would give it a decent review compared to the others. The focus here is more on plot than character and things are substantially slow-moving in season 1 (think glacial pace). It has a much more serious tone than the other two because SyFy was trying to cash in on the Battlestar Galactica hype. I think it missed the boat, personally, but there are some who love it dearly. \n\nFinally, I noticed you did not list Battlestar Galactica (2003-2007) on your list of viewed shows. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it to you. It ranks in the realm of Lost/Westworld in terms of story/acting/writing/special effects.

It's a classic series that will keep you glued to the screen as time goes on. The cast of characters mesh well and play off perfectly with one another, the stories are pretty good although they are a bit weak as is the writing in Season 1. Before you know it, you'll be hooked and binging them pretty quickly.\n\nAs for the movie, it's kinda split down the middle in terms of the popularity. I suggest watching it, or, at the very least watch the first half and then kinda skip around till you see the end.\n\nThe movie will set up the characters (even though different actors play them in the show) and Jack O'Neill (Two L's!) goes through a bit of a change. In the movie, played by Kurt Russel, he's very serious after a certain incident I won't mention here.  He's down, depressed, angry and just doesn't give a real shit about anything.\n\nIn the show, it continues with RDA (Richard Dean Anderson of McGuyver fame) taking the lead roll, however he is a bit lighter and as the series progresses, he becomes sort of a goof who just doesn't care. But in a likeable and good way.\n\nThe movie will set everything up and have more impact when you watch the show - is it necessary? Probably not. But it doesn't hurt and may make the show for a better watch.\n\nStargate Atlantis picks up using Season 7's ending of SG1 to begin its show. If you watch them back to back, (which you won't have to as they do very little tie ins but there are a few) SG1 Season 8 and SGA (Atlantis) Season 1 are the correct order there.\n\nAtlantis was ran by the same creators and writers so you will see a lot of similarities in the Atlantis' productions. You will also be introduced to probably one of the best characters since RDA's Col. Jack O'Neill (Still two L's!) - Doctor McKay. In fact almost the entire cast is likeable and you'll most likely end up binge watching this one as well.\n\nNow, my take on Stargate Universe; the show was dark. Very dark. It was a change of form for the series Stargate as a whole. Whereas SG1 had a light hearted tone and comedy but knew when to be serious and dramatic, with Atlantis following suit, Universe was drastically dark with less of the comedy and lightheartedness tones that the franchise was known for.\n\nI believe this in part, turned off a lot of fans to the show as a whole, adding to its cancellation. Personally, I could not get into it. It was too much of a change, I didn't care for any of the characters despite some grade A acting by the cast, and a wonderful cast it is. But it wasn't quite what I was looking for.\n\nHowever, Universe is also a bit more in tone with that of Westworld or even some parts of Lost. You may enjoy it much more than I did.\n\nIf you decide to give them a check;\n\nStargate (movie - at least watch the first half and maybe the end)\n\nStargate (SG1) Seasons 1-10 and two made for tv movies to close the series.\n\nStargate Atlantis (SGA) Start at Season 8 of SG1 or just watch it after you finish SG1.

Atlantis was a much better show near the end of SG1, but apparently the network didn't see it that way and decided to keep SG1 going. I'm not saying the last eps of SG1 were bad, they just weren't anything near the first 5-6 seasons.

I'm not trying to get into the plot very much here so I don't spoil anything for you, but you should definitely watch it.\n\nAlso, there is Stargate: Universe. I didn't like it at first because I found it to be a blatant rip off of BSG when it comes to things like the camera movements (mostly in space stuff) and one of the enemies they ended up fighting were quite similar to the Cylons, as well as other factors I'm not gonna get into since it probably requires spoilers and there's really no point.

There is no reason why that couldn't have been woven into other episodes, like with that Hilltop episode last week. \n\nNegan is the big selling point this season and sure enough, they've managed to fuck it up. When he's on-screen, it's a lot of fun, and he certainly doesn't have to dominate every episode, but placing Daryl into a situation where it seems like he has no plausible escape, only to wait every two or three episodes before we check in on him again is idiotic.

I work for a major isp (not naming who and any examples I use are because they are the easiest to explain with), and it's well known Netflix streaming makes up for a very significant amount of traffic in the US, I didn't believe the numbers myself when I first heard them\n\nJust recently it became public that Xfinity customers will be able to stream Netflix off their X1 box, and while many may not think much of that, Comcast and Netflix have a delicate relationship due to Comcast being a major ISP and Netflix requiring so many resources. If an ISP invests money in r and d for video streaming a lot of that motivation is trying to sustain all the streaming the vast majority of their customers do, and prepare for future increases in similar traffic. It's almost like everything they invest money in can indirectly be linked to the ridiculous amounts of video content people expect, even if that's not the main purpose\n\nNot surprised Netflix is finally allowing this feature now that Trump, someone who has a negative stance on net neutrality, is President Elect. Comcast's last campaign to make changes to such laws and regulations have crashed and burned and have greatly hurt their image. Now that the scene is changing Netflix has to be aware that it should have a strong relationship with ISP's, which it probably tries to have regardless, but they would be in more a position now to try and take away some of that steaming burden to the ISP's they impact. In the long run if there is a shift in how people use Netflix, and download most of their content to watch over periods of time, then at least Netflix's bandwidth usage wouldn't be as high as it would be long term\n\nDon't have any hard evidence to support my rant but in my opinion this feature and the partnership with the X1 aren't a coincidence, especially with changing political circumstances and Comcast's business model being constantly threatened (again using them due to their sheer size and influence)  "], [2, "Finally, we can get reliable, HD torrents of original Netflix content much faster."], [1, "[deleted]"], [1, "I do not mind this."], [1, "took em a while"], [1, "Lol.

If an ISP invests money in r and d for video streaming a lot of that motivation is trying to sustain all the streaming the vast majority of their customers do, and prepare for future increases in similar traffic. It's almost like everything they invest money in can indirectly be linked to the ridiculous amounts of video content people expect, even if that's not the main purpose\n\nNot surprised Netflix is finally allowing this feature now that Trump, someone who has a negative stance on net neutrality, is President Elect. Comcast's last campaign to make changes to such laws and regulations have crashed and burned and have greatly hurt their image. Now that the scene is changing Netflix has to be aware that it should have a strong relationship with ISP's, which it probably tries to have regardless, but they would be in more a position now to try and take away some of that steaming burden to the ISP's they impact. In the long run if there is a shift in how people use Netflix, and download most of their content to watch over periods of time, then at least Netflix's bandwidth usage wouldn't be as high as it would be long term\n\nDon't have any hard evidence to support my rant but in my opinion this feature and the partnership with the X1 aren't a coincidence, especially with changing political circumstances and Comcast's business model being constantly threatened (again using them due to their sheer size and influence)  ", "id": "dan7u1m"}], [{"comment": "Finally, we can get reliable, HD torrents of original Netflix content much faster.", "id": "danjz5k"}], [{"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "dam3o8w"}, {"comment": "Is Marco Polo no good?", "id": "dam5osl"}, {"comment": "It's not bad.
