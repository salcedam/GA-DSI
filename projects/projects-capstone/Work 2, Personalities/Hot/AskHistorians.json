Though looks could be a factor, for the most part it was about bloodline and proof of so-called pure Aryan blood that mattered. Having a \"Jewish appearance\" was not enough to consider one a Jew. \n\nSource wise, I'm not near my books but I think what you are looking for here is a study on the Nuremberg Race Laws (1935 I believe, however I also believe it was amended to include new criteria as time went on) which specifically spelled out who was able to legally be a citizen of the Reich. This also gets convoluted as there were essentially levels of Jewish blood that were considered acceptable, but this fluctuated as time went on.\n\nAnyways, I think the question you are asking is built on a misconception of the \"blonde hair blue eye\" German, whereas the actual implementation was about proving your \"Aryan blood\" to a level acceptable to German law at the time (particularly after the Nuremberg Laws). \n\nHope that's sourced enough. For general Reich racial policy, doctrine and implementation I suppose Evans' 'The Coming of the Third Reich' would have plenty on this... though I hate to always lean on \"read Evans' trilogy\" for Third Reich sources.

The Greater Reich Hitler and others envisioned was meant to be a nation free from *Untermenschen* and the \"threat\" from the Jews leaving the Race of Aryans to finally be pure \"again\" and never assaulted again.\n\nThese theories extend back to the 19th century where many \"scientists\" (often bored, rich aristocrats) began looking into the origins of Europeans. An Ayran race settled mainly in central and Northern Europe, as they asserted, with the Scandinavians commonly referred to (as we do) as Nordic. Scandinavia was a part of this Aryan race as, according to their fictional understanding of racial migration, the Aryans had settled all over these lands. The \"purest\" of these tended to have Blond hair and blue eyes, as they believed. \n\nTo finally get to the point, being Aryan was not just physical features. FAR from it. It was thought that Aryans were literally \"supermen.\" They were more athletic, they had superior brains, they were more focused on the atomic family, had better \"christian values.\" Etc. Thus an good Aryan-German was superior because of his or her genes in *every* way to any other being on Earth. Being blonde and blue eyed played better for propaganda, but again was in no way the sole feature of what it was to be Aryan. \n\nHaven't typed all of that out, it is on my conscience to write as well how utterly absurd and disgusting this ideology was, though I am sure anyone reading this is of the same mind.\n\n\nAnywho, to begin setting up this \"pure\" Reich, as /u/jonra678 wrote, the Nuremberg laws were established as well as discriminatory laws barring certain races or religions from holding public office, wealth, etc. These laws in the 1930s left some who not could \"prove\" German ancestry (i.e. they were part of another \"race\") with little flexiblity but to move. For others they were placed under \"protective custody\" (to protect the Aryan race from their \"diseased\" genes though this also applied to political parties). Once the war broke out, the homocidal aspects of this completely fictional racial policy were carried out of control into the East (where Jews, Slavs, Roma, etc were destined for extermination to again make a \"safe space\" for the Germans/Aryans, the so-called *Lebensraum*).\n\nI hope this answers you question as best as possible.

At the beginning of the War, there was no core of expert, veteran naval pilots with significant combat experience such as what the Japanese had acquired against the Chinese.  As such, American fighter tactics were unsuited for their planes, and American training was not up to par-- leading to fiascos like the Midway torpedo attacks.  At Midway, as I mentioned previously, the USN lost three full squadrons of torpedo planes and aircrew, doing zero damage to the Japanese.\n\nWhat advantages American flyers *did* have, however, were very substantial.  The USN had the advantages of a safe home front, superior natural resources, greater population, and larger industrial capacity.  The USN could afford to rotate pilots back home to train the next generation of aces.  There were simply no fuel shortages or urgent needs at the front that would necessitate skimping on training.   This is borne out by the kill rankings.  The top USN ace of the war, David McCampbell, scored 34 kills.  An extremely impressive number to be sure, but one that wouldn't crack the Japanese Navy's top 5.\n\nIn marked contrast to the Japanese, the Americans had geared up for a long war from Day One.  [In 1940, Congress passed the Two-Ocean Navy Act, preparing for America's eventual entry into the war by funding a navy capable of taking on any combination of two foes at once.](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9905E2DE153AEF3ABC4152DFB0668389659EDE&legacy=true)\n\nAs the war progressed, these industrial and organizational advantages gradually allowed the Americans to properly train their pilots and use the expertise gained at the front to best advantage.  And this paid off.  An illustration: [the Japanese were so desperate for flight decks that the IJN hastily converted unsuitable ocean liners into aircraft carriers for actual combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Shin'y%C5%8D).  Meanwhile, the USN converted two [passenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IX-64) [vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IX-81) into aircraft carriers for the sole purpose of training new pilots.

I gather the French had a similar system at least at Verdun, but given the issues the French had with soldier conditions throughout the war I don't think it was effective. \n\nI'm sorry it doesn't answer the main question here, but troops in WW1 wouldn't spend much of their time on the front line trench, which may help explain how morale was kept up even when troops didn't know they'd be going home.", "id": "daqbpho"}, {"comment": "That makes a lot of sense.

All the major powers adopted some variety of service-by-requirement; once conscripted, you were in the army until you were dead, crippled (psychologically or physically), sent home for some special reason (say your wife died, leaving your children orphans), or the war ended. The only exception to this that I'm aware of is the American \"points system\" of 1945; troops who had been in service long enough, or had been wounded/decorated enough, were excused from taking part in the conceived invasion of Japan.\n\nNow this does not, of course, mean that troops stayed at the sharp end of the war for years on end. This is impossible; according to two US Army studies, 60 days of continuous combat was enough to induce psychological disturbances in 98% of soldiers, while 200 to 240 days on the line was enough to break most men. There's no reason to think this was a uniquely American problem. When possible or necessary, units were periodically withdrawn for periods of rest and rehabilitation, and men were sometimes granted individual leave. The Germans and Russians in particular had a habit of grinding divisions up into nothing and then reforming them around a shattered core of survivors, a process that could take months. The Americans, however, preferred to rebuild divisions while still on the line, using the Individual Replacement System, whereby trained replacements were kept in theater and substituted for men who had become casualties as and when needed. This enabled them to maintain a high operations tempo in Northwest Europe in 1944-45, but it really didn't work very well on the micro level. The replacements were usually rusty and out of shape by the time they reached their units, there was no time for refresher training while on the line, it badly damaged unit cohesion, and the result was a lot of dead and wounded replacements.\n\nSo, just as a hypothetical, say you landed on Utah Beach on 6 June, 1944 with the 8th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division. It is entirely possible that, unless you were wounded or evacuated for sickness or some other cause, you would have spent the vast majority of the next eleven months in combat. Now, you would have had the occasional day or two when nothing much was happening, but except for a short period in early December after the 4th ID was withdrawn from the Hurtgen Forest and before the Germans invaded the Ardennes, you would have been at the front, within enemy artillery, if not rifle, range for the duration.", "id": "daqsdhw"}, {"comment": ">Now this does not, of course, mean that troops stayed at the sharp end of the war for years on end.

Peter Mansoor argues in his book *The GI Offensive in Europe* that the US Army, for a variety of reasons, failed to mobilize enough combat arms divisions for WW2. This meant that those infantry and armored divisions that were deployed to Europe - about 60, spread between NW Europe and Italy - had to be kept at the front as much as possible because they could not be relieved for periodic rest and rebuilding in a rear area; to do so would have sacrificed the initiative and allowed the Germans a breather. \n\nSo, to expand on my example, the 4th ID was literally attacking almost constantly - fighting, marching, whatever - from the sixth of June 1944 until early December, from Utah Beach to Paris to the German border, and then again from January until May 1945; during this time, they suffered more than 22,000 casualties, almost all of them in the infantry, or about 2.5 times as many casualties as they had infantrymen to start with. This does not mean that units were in close contact with the enemy at all times, but a regiment in reserve 3-6 miles behind the main line of resistance or a battalion 1-2 miles for a day or two is still in the combat zone, still prone to being shelled, ordered into action at very short notice, sleeping on the ground, unable to wash properly, shaving out of helmets, eating canned food, etc. This constant exposure to danger, privation, and the strain of killing placed a tremendous burden on the American combat soldier and at least in part accounts for the high battle fatigue/PTSD rate of the US Army in WW2.\n\n>only to move a few trenches back where you were unlikely to catch a bullet, but still had to sleep to the symphony of artillery shells?\n\nThere are a few examples of attritional, defense-in-depth fighting in WW2, but for the most part it was a more mobile, dispersed style of fighting than the western front of WWI that was arguably more taxing on the men involved because the operational tempo was often so much higher. Very often, soldiers in the defense would find themselves without *any* prepared defensive positions to fall back to; you had the ground you were holding, and maybe a battalion in reserve a couple miles behind you, and that was it. \n\nTo continue using 4th ID as an example, when they were attacked in Luxembourg in December 1944, the division was spread over a front of *35 miles*. To put it into perspective, if you added up the number of infantrymen in the division and divided by 35, you get about 257 men per mile. Once you subtract necessary reserves, you end up with a situation where one rifle company of 168 (at full strength, anyway) men could be responsible for more than a mile of ground. This is far too much ground to defend WWI-style, and they had to hedgehog up in villages and small towns. Once combat began, these forward units were easily surrounded, some few overrun, and could not easily be relieved.", "id": "daqvnn6"}, {"comment": "Ah, okay. So I was close to the mark.

You can\u2019t get inside their heads and examine subjective feelings which led to the act. All you can do is talk of historical context.\n\nIt\u2019s worth saying that *sati* was incredibly rare, even before the Brits arrived. There are prior Mughal proscriptions against the act, but they indicate it was an isolated and regional problem, mostly confined to Rajputana during Mughal rule. It was different during British rule, when it seems to have predominantly involved Bengal. There\u2019s some reason to believe that at least some of the Mughal stories confuse *sati* with *jauhar*, which was a different but related practice.\n\nIn its original meaning, \u201csati\u201d says nothing about self-immolation, it simply means \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cchaste\u201d. In the *Manusmriti* (around 200 BC), *sati* is not an action, it\u2019s a person \u2013 a woman devoted to her husband. There\u2019s no mention of burning. The oldest mention of *sati* in Hindu literature comes from the *Mahabharata*. Prince Yudhishthira asks the sage Markandeya if he\u2019s ever heard of a woman more devoted to her husband than the princess Draupadi, and Markandeya relates the story of the *sati* Savitri.\n\nSavitri is a woman who falls in love with and chooses to marry a man named Satyavan, despite knowing there\u2019s a prophecy that Satyavan will die a year after his marriage. The story is about how she talks Lord Yama, the god of death, into sparing the life of her husband. There\u2019s no burning involved, no sacrifices. Yama is awed by her devotion and spares the life of Satyavan, and the two live happily ever after, as fairy tales go.\n\nThere are literally dozens of women in Hindu literature honored as *sati*, who didn\u2019t jump into the funeral pyre with their husbands. If you ever attend the Hindu festival of *Karva Chauth*, you can hear women today reciting ancient stories of hallowed women from the past, *satis* who drew the respect and favor of gods, but didn\u2019t actually burn themselves.\n\nIt's hard to figure when *sati* acquired its secondary meaning of self-immolation on the funeral pyre of the husband. There are *sati* stones and *sati* temples dating back to around the 6th century that commemorate women as *sati* but it's not clear whether they're talking about a woman who burned herself to death, or simply a woman who was recognized for being an exemplary wife.\n\nThe earliest unambiguous historical accounts we have of ritual suicide by fire come from 12th century Rajputana, via Islamic literature. But these aren\u2019t actually *sati*, they are cases of *jauhar*.\n\n\nThese were cruel times, and in warfare no mercy was shown to the defeated. Women on the losing side faced the prospect of rape and torture in the hands of the enemy. Rajputana had a very martial culture, honed over centuries of warfare with the Muslims. They evolved a custom of ritual suicide.\n\nIf their town or fort was besieged by superior numbers and there was no hope of victory or escape, they would commit suicide. Men performed a *puja* (religious ceremony), then marched out one last time to die in battle. Women built a big fire in the center of town and walked into it. This was *jauhar*.\n\nThe difference from *sati* is that these women weren\u2019t walking into the pyre of their husbands - the husbands were outside fighting to the death against the invaders.

You can\u2019t get inside their heads and examine subjective feelings which led to the act. All you can do is talk of historical context.\n\nIt\u2019s worth saying that *sati* was incredibly rare, even before the Brits arrived. There are prior Mughal proscriptions against the act, but they indicate it was an isolated and regional problem, mostly confined to Rajputana during Mughal rule. It was different during British rule, when it seems to have predominantly involved Bengal. There\u2019s some reason to believe that at least some of the Mughal stories confuse *sati* with *jauhar*, which was a different but related practice.\n\nIn its original meaning, \u201csati\u201d says nothing about self-immolation, it simply means \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cchaste\u201d. In the *Manusmriti* (around 200 BC), *sati* is not an action, it\u2019s a person \u2013 a woman devoted to her husband. There\u2019s no mention of burning. The oldest mention of *sati* in Hindu literature comes from the *Mahabharata*. Prince Yudhishthira asks the sage Markandeya if he\u2019s ever heard of a woman more devoted to her husband than the princess Draupadi, and Markandeya relates the story of the *sati* Savitri.\n\nSavitri is a woman who falls in love with and chooses to marry a man named Satyavan, despite knowing there\u2019s a prophecy that Satyavan will die a year after his marriage. The story is about how she talks Lord Yama, the god of death, into sparing the life of her husband. There\u2019s no burning involved, no sacrifices. Yama is awed by her devotion and spares the life of Satyavan, and the two live happily ever after, as fairy tales go.\n\nThere are literally dozens of women in Hindu literature honored as *sati*, who didn\u2019t jump into the funeral pyre with their husbands. If you ever attend the Hindu festival of *Karva Chauth*, you can hear women today reciting ancient stories of hallowed women from the past, *satis* who drew the respect and favor of gods, but didn\u2019t actually burn themselves.\n\nIt's hard to figure when *sati* acquired its secondary meaning of self-immolation on the funeral pyre of the husband. There are *sati* stones and *sati* temples dating back to around the 6th century that commemorate women as *sati* but it's not clear whether they're talking about a woman who burned herself to death, or simply a woman who was recognized for being an exemplary wife.\n\nThe earliest unambiguous historical accounts we have of ritual suicide by fire come from 12th century Rajputana, via Islamic literature. But these aren\u2019t actually *sati*, they are cases of *jauhar*.\n\n\nThese were cruel times, and in warfare no mercy was shown to the defeated. Women on the losing side faced the prospect of rape and torture in the hands of the enemy. Rajputana had a very martial culture, honed over centuries of warfare with the Muslims. They evolved a custom of ritual suicide.\n\nIf their town or fort was besieged by superior numbers and there was no hope of victory or escape, they would commit suicide. Men performed a *puja* (religious ceremony), then marched out one last time to die in battle. Women built a big fire in the center of town and walked into it. This was *jauhar*.\n\nThe difference from *sati* is that these women weren\u2019t walking into the pyre of their husbands - the husbands were outside fighting to the death against the invaders. They were doing it to avoid rape and torture and death at the hands of the enemy. They picked a rather painful way to die to show that they weren\u2019t taking the easy way out; it was for honor and not out of cowardice.\n\nThe story from Bengal is different; there are indeed reports of women climbing into the funeral pyre after the deaths of their husbands.

This can for example be gleaned by Marx turning Hegel on its head. Hegel proposed the idea that history was the process towards more enlightenment and rationality (not in the technical sense but in the sense of Vernunft). For Hegel, the world and societies change because the Weltgeist was able to further and further penetrate the people's mind and make them more rational, reasonable, and enlightened. This is a quintessential enlightenment philosophy, i.e. a philosophy that in the absence of God serving as the ultimate rational of an explanation for change and difference seeks to connect said phenomena with a quality that is not external to man (God) but one that is intrinsic to man (reason), albeit with Hegel the Weltgeist does posses certain divine qualities.\n\nMarx in his historic materialism turned Hegel on its head. Where Hegel posited that when people became more rational and reasonable via the Weltgeist, their societies would change and they would for example change the way how their economy was organized, Marx posited that the way the economy was organized would influence the ideological formations of a society such as the role of religion, what kind of system of government they wanted etc. pp. For him the base was always economics and the rest changed dependent on that. This is a deeply modern train of thought since it presupposes that society is something that is subject to change altogether rather than something that is the expression of a sort of natural order of things. In this sense Communism, especially in its Marxist form, is a product of modernity and not certainly not its cause.\n\nAlso, the whole goal behind communism, i.e. to create a society that is more equal, just and emanicipated, is one that only makes sense in a modern context because our understanding of equality, justice, and emancipation are so shaped by modernity and the enlightenment. It's imperative to understand here that how societies and people understand these concepts changes massively over time and the shift that was contained within the enlightenment and the beginning of modernity that developed incrementally and over a long time are the very basis of the idea of Communism and the discourse in which it as an ideology is rooted.\n\nNow, as for the second part of the question: Was Communism the sole factor in driving modernity forward? And if the questions is asked this way the answer to that is also no. Communism and its movement were one of the factors that at some points in history and in some places in the world have contributed to change in a more emancipatory manner but they were far from the only ones.\n\nIn some places and for some things organized labor and its ties to communist ideas and parties was crucial for certain developments. One of the most obvious example is Germany and Bismarck's social laws in the 19th century. Things like an 8-hour work day and other labor laws were in this case very much inspired by fear of the strength of the labor movement and it was seen as a good way to appease them, though again, this was far from the only factor in that.

Is Austria-Hungary?), the most general answers to this would be no in the sense that in the early 20th century we see political movements in Western countries that campaign for votes and rights for women such as the suffragettes. In that e.g. New Zealand and Australia had granted women's suffrage already in the 19th century and early 20th century (1893 and 1902 to be exact). And in that women in many a Western country already had albeit in most cases limited property rights.\n\nApplying a Marxist analysis to this case, one could argue that these differences arose from a different economic base. 19th and early 20th century Capitalism necessitated to a certain extend the integration of women into the work force and class structure, the same way, it necessitated \u2013 again to a certain extent \u2013 the protection of universal property rights On this basis, a campaign for political participation and the protection for property rights was possible even within the confines of bourgeois ideology. In a society, which is built upon an economic base that does not necessitate said integration into the work force, a Marxist would argue that predominant ideology makes it much harder to campaign in that way.\n\nBut again, the push for these rights and also the institution of universal suffrage in the West is not solely the product of communist ideology and practice. While ties between the movements existed, e.g. Sylvia Pankhurst in England, in some countries and cases, the suffrage movement and the women's right movement as a whole were very bourgeois and in some cases even anti-communist. \n\nIt's also incredibly hard to compare modern Saudi Arabia with early 20th century countries because of the different formation in political structure, different social and economic structure, and different political et. al. context. The whole business of comparing modern states or applying a certain historical narrative to them is incredibly complicated and in most cases badly thought through. It's really difficult to impossible to seek pre-modern social structures or other societal formations within a country or society that exists in modern times because while superficially those might seem apparent, it is not possible to differentiate the contemporary form its always present modern context.

But that's an example of the host getting credit, not the people actually making the food.\n\nThis lack of notoriety, however, wasn't necessarily due to kitchen staff having a low society standing. Of course, there were plenty of unskilled kitchen positions that did not convey any prestige, like the boys who stood in front of fires for hours on end rotating meat spits or the scullery workers who scrubbed dishes. At the same time, the individuals who ran the kitchen were seen as important. Going back to Henry VIII's kitchen, it was run by the Clerk of the Kitchen, who was in charge of storeroom access, food distribution, and kitchen accounts, in addition to generally managing all the kitchen staff. In exchange, he was allowed the same food as the senior courtiers were (and what food one was allowed to eat was a reflection of one's social status). Under the Clerk of the Kitchen were three Master Cooks--each in charge of his own team of cooks--who were \"respected professionals,\" to quote Weir (69).

As for what exactly they were eating, meals relied heavily upon meat, with bread also playing a significant role. Vegetables weren't eaten as much as we might think, though Henry VIII loved fruit, so that was served frequently. However, the quality of these items would vary based on rank. A Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, for example (and yes, his job was exactly what you think it is) would have on a daily basis: beef, mutton, veal, capons, conies, pheasants, and either lamb, pigeon, or chicken. And that's just the meat. In addition, he would have fruit, bread, and tart. A servant would eat the cheaper cuts of meat along with pottage, which was essentially meat-flavored oatmeal.

Even when the fortunes of war are against him, he's calm and great at enduring hardship. He has great reason and judgement, and treats any kind of rites to God, the Buddha, pagan divination or superstition with disdain. In name at first he acts as if he belongs to Hokke Sect (Nichren Buddhism), but after attaining greatness he looks down on all idols. In a few points he follows Zen Buddhism and does not believe in the immortality of the soul or rewards and punishments in the afterlife. His house is incredibly clean, and he is incredibly meticulous in everything. He hates protracting in conversations and long preludes, and talks friendly even with lowly servants. He likes famous tea bowls, horses, swords, falconry, and really likes sumo wrestling. No one is allowed to wear weapons before him. He has a slight depressed look.

He had to remove the figurehead shugo of Owari, who was his nominal superior, on his way to unite the province. But if that temporarily made him some enemies, so be it. Doing such things were extremely common in the period.

The whole idea of \"classical\" as we know it doesn't show up until the 19th century and the popularization of Romantic ideals.  Back then there was just music, and even what we now know as \"folk\", or the early forerunners of what we call \"pop\" (as found, e.g. in *The Beggar's Opera* (1728)) were understood as \"genres\" in this narrow sense relating to what the music was *for*; but it wouldn't be seen as unusual or inappropriate for the very same composer to be active both in these lowly, 'folk' genres and in the higher-status music we now call 'classical'!\n\nNevertheless, there was a clear awareness that music for \"high-class\" *uses* would have to play by well-defined and somewhat artificial rules, which were clearly laid out in the music \"textbooks\" of the time.  The strictest rules were for sacred music, which had to follow the *stile antico* ruleset (as mentioned in the parent comment) and feature complex fugal imitation.  Next came other high-class genres of what we now call \"classical\", which still had some restrictions but not nearly as constraining as the ones of *stile antico*.  Music for \"lowly\" uses (popular singing and dancing) was pretty much a free-for-all, and this obviously reinforced its \"lowly\" status in the mind of those who were aware of these details.  It's worth mentioning this because it's the closest thing to what OP said about \"classical\" music being understood as such.  Also the details of this are mostly about the 18th c. as well, but the gist of it had been true since the Renaissance, and the overall notion that \"sacred\" music has to follow some sort of rules was relevant already in the medieval era.", "id": "darkpjz"}, {"comment": "Thank you for responding, and thank you, u/euozof, for expanding on the answer.\nThe distinction between 'stile antico' and 'galanten stil' was closer to what I was searching for, though I didn't really think about the music's importance in events, only in the different ways it can offer recreation to groups of different people, independent of time and place.

Just a few tiny islands to go.\n\nThen I have to paste together a bunch of screenshots and draw borders by hand :(\n\nAny computer/map-making expert can help me?"], [8, "This is related to a bit of economic history that is not studied as often but it is very important from the impact  that it had on the world. I am referring to the economic relations between  Japan and United States.\n\nThe United States had up until 1980's taken a fairly lax view on Japan's economic policy despite it's fairly negative impact on American economy especially it's Industry. Japan used Industrial policy to develop it's export oriented Industry that had created vast imbalances in form of excess savings in Japan, heavy trade surplus for Japan that made it one of the largest capital exporters in form of foreign direct investment in other countries, over investment and weak domestic demand. The US was becoming very critical of this as this entire policy depended on Japan being a weak country and the US being unquestionably stronger. It was becoming clear that this was no longer the case.\n\nThe persistent trade surplus had as I mentioned earlier turned Japan into the world's largest creditor nation in 1985. The impact on the United States was the exact opposite. It had turned into the world's largest debtor nation with it's liabilities increasing from $81 Billion to $831 Billion. This was economically untenable. The ideological aspect was also problematic. Many were questioning whether Japanese State Capitalism was superior to American version. Many stressed upon many features of Japanese models and called upon American policy to start emulating certain aspects of it.\n\nSo, what is interesting about this? Well, the Japanese were getting very worried that their core strengths were being recognized and that many people were learning too much of it's secret. Japan employed a trick that Russia would use later (as they did during the recent elections). Use American  domestic  agenda to influence foreign policy in it's favour. In case of Japan it was the stressing upon racism in American public whereas for Russia it is isolationist tendency on both left and the right. Whenever any article started occurring that stressed upon Japanese differences, the consulate of Japan would respond very quickly stressing that it was racist and exclusionary to differentiate them from the West. They criticized that \"revisionist\" writers who were \"Japan-bashers,\" a barely disguised euphemism for anti-Japanese racists. The local Japanese consul would keep on denying the charges and claim that there were no structural differences in Japan's economy.This campaign succeeded in silencing many critics. Japan even threatened to sell weapons to China and Russia and this worked until the mid 1980's.\n\nThis suited many American policy makers perfectly. They could now attack Japan only on the grounds of artificially weakening currency and not on certain other features like direct government assistance for Japanese companies to compete with foreign ones and use of policy banks to slightly repress markets and financial sector. This went against the American notion that American and Western liberal market Capitalism was superior to State Capitalism. The United States then forced Japan to strengthen the Yen which proved disastrous for Japan. The Japanese Central bank cut interest rates which worsened the excess capacity and sent much of the capital into local construction industry and real estate speculation leading ultimately to the bubble burst from which Japan never recovered.\n\nAnother important point. When the US stock market crashed in 1987, Japan directly assisted the US by buying a large amount of stocks stabilizing the financial system. This made the US implicitly dependent on the Japanese government. In 1995, the Japanese government succeeded in forcing the US to allow for weakening of yuan to boost it's exports. There was an implicit threat that Japan would pull out the support that it was providing the US by buying government bonds and other forms of investment. Japan's low-cost financing replaced America's virtual dearth of domestic savings and allowed the United States to run huge external deficits without paying any of the usual costs, particularly a catastrophic loss in value of the dollar, while keeping inflation low and American financial markets buoyant. The US agreed and that had a devastating impact on South Asia leading to the East Asian crisis because many of those countries had their currency pegged to US dollar and were also export dependent. Worse, they had carelessly liberalized their currency markets leading to a disaster.\n\nThere is more but does the 20 year rule apply , [m](https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgy_K_Zhukov)[od](https://www.reddit.com/user/commiespaceinvader)[s](https://www.reddit.com/user/sunagainstgold)?\n\nReferences:\n\nThe Japan That Can Say No by Akio Morita and Shintaro Ishihara\n\nJapanese \"Capitalism\" Revisited by Chalmers Johnson\n\n\n"], [5, "Book reviews take a long time to catch up with publications.

It is not too hard to come up with proposals that would preserve deterrent capability and credibility and yet require some kind of explicit requirement for multiple-party consent before first strike use.\n\nThe only really critical feedback I have gotten are people who say that existing procedures either probably have some check in place (despite a total lack of evidence and much to suggest the contrary), or that such a thing would be totally impossible/insane (I think both history and reason show this to be extremely optimistic), or that the \"incapacitation\" procedures of the 23rd amendment already provide for this (for several reasons, I don't think they do).

Specifically, is the US a trendsetter in having nuclear authorisation exclusively vested in the civilian executive, or an outlier?\n\nThis is a tricky thing to work out, because not all countries have published doctrine on this question, and some published doctrine has been contradictory, which makes analysis difficult. (Even published US doctrine is not explicit about many of these points.) But generally speaking, yes, the US is a trendsetter on this point. The UK for example very deliberately vested power in the PM's office in the same way the US did with the presidency. It gets more complex if one asks about how this would work out with NATO, too. \n\nThe last time the US had a big public study on this was 1975 but it was pretty speculative with regards to the USSR and China (the US analysts had a very hard time figuring out whether the army or the political offices ran the show in the nuke realms, and there were also wildcards like the KGB being authorized to actually have custody over the weapons themselves). I have been doing some research into this topic from a historical standpoint. The most interesting thing I've seen reported (the truth of which I don't know) is that in the 1970s the French supposedly developed command and control systems that maintained an actual separation of civilian and military authority all the way up to the point of use of the weapon. Activating their Mirage bombers required one set of authorization (from the military), broadcast by radio waves, while activation of the bombs required another set (from the civilian government).

Howard's King Kull, Bran Mak Morn, and Kathulos, as well as *Unaussprechlichen Kulten* (which Lovecraft was involved in providing the German title for); Clark Ashton Smith's Tsathoggua, Averoigne (which Lovecraft created a Roman-era backstory for), and *Book of Eibon*; Robert Bloch's *Cultes des Goules* and *De Vermis Mysteriis* (which Lovecraft provided the Latin title for)...and they in turn borrowed his Cthulhu and Azathoth and *Necronomicon*. It became a literary game, but not a really serious one; no one was proclaiming ownership of these characters, nor did people start out writing stories to be a part of this shared mythos - it was only to provide a common background that could tie in disparate stories. Imagine if you were 13 years old in the 1930s and picked up a copy of *Weird Tales* off the rack, and you saw references to Cthulhu and the *Necronomicon* in three stories by as many authors - would you imagine that was an original creation, or some common mythology you'd never run across that they were drawing upon? Even many pulpsters weren't sure, and wrote in to Lovecraft, Howard, and Smith asking for particulars - and it led to innumerable hoaxes, such as advertisements for the *Necronomicon*.\n\nAugust Derleth was also a contributor to this Mythos - but he was also something of a codifier; this is the part of the issue that later fans and scholars had with him. Derleth is the one that came up with the idea to call it \"the Cthulhu Mythos\" (or \"the mythology of Hastur,\" basing it off Chambers/Bierce), the closest Lovecraft ever came up with a title for it was \"Yog-Sothothery.\" As a writer and publisher, Derleth and his partner Donald Wandrei at Arkham House did a huge amount of work to promote Lovecraft, to publish his work and letters, but Derleth was also a pulp writer himself that needed to make ends meet - and he wrote the first really fan-fiction-esque efforts to \"codify\" the Mythos, as well as a series of \"posthumous collaborations\" - stories based around some idea of Lovecraft's from his commonplace book, or a fragment of his writing - most of which are considered sub-par to Lovecraft's original work, and slightly duplicitous in the way they were promoted.\n\nOne of the most seminal essays on all this is the brief-but-to-the-point [The Derleth Mythos](http://www.epberglund.com/RGttCM/nightscapes/NS04/hplnf3.htm) by Richard L. Tierney; although I should point out that recently there's been some efforts by John D. Haefele and the like to somewhat ameliorate the rampant criticism of Derleth that has accumulated since the latter's death, most notably in [A Look Behind the Derleth Mythos: Origins of the Cthulhu Mythos](http://www.worldcat.org/title/look-behind-the-derleth-mythos-origins-of-the-cthulhu-mythos/oclc/857717856).", "id": "dapd4z1"}, {"comment": "Very interesting, thanks!", "id": "dapdxcd"}], [{"comment": "We finally, after way too long, got the 500K census pushed over the finish line!

I am referring to the economic relations between  Japan and United States.\n\nThe United States had up until 1980's taken a fairly lax view on Japan's economic policy despite it's fairly negative impact on American economy especially it's Industry. Japan used Industrial policy to develop it's export oriented Industry that had created vast imbalances in form of excess savings in Japan, heavy trade surplus for Japan that made it one of the largest capital exporters in form of foreign direct investment in other countries, over investment and weak domestic demand. The US was becoming very critical of this as this entire policy depended on Japan being a weak country and the US being unquestionably stronger. It was becoming clear that this was no longer the case.\n\nThe persistent trade surplus had as I mentioned earlier turned Japan into the world's largest creditor nation in 1985. The impact on the United States was the exact opposite. It had turned into the world's largest debtor nation with it's liabilities increasing from $81 Billion to $831 Billion. This was economically untenable. The ideological aspect was also problematic. Many were questioning whether Japanese State Capitalism was superior to American version. Many stressed upon many features of Japanese models and called upon American policy to start emulating certain aspects of it.\n\nSo, what is interesting about this? Well, the Japanese were getting very worried that their core strengths were being recognized and that many people were learning too much of it's secret. Japan employed a trick that Russia would use later (as they did during the recent elections). Use American  domestic  agenda to influence foreign policy in it's favour. In case of Japan it was the stressing upon racism in American public whereas for Russia it is isolationist tendency on both left and the right. Whenever any article started occurring that stressed upon Japanese differences, the consulate of Japan would respond very quickly stressing that it was racist and exclusionary to differentiate them from the West. They criticized that \"revisionist\" writers who were \"Japan-bashers,\" a barely disguised euphemism for anti-Japanese racists. The local Japanese consul would keep on denying the charges and claim that there were no structural differences in Japan's economy.This campaign succeeded in silencing many critics. Japan even threatened to sell weapons to China and Russia and this worked until the mid 1980's.\n\nThis suited many American policy makers perfectly. They could now attack Japan only on the grounds of artificially weakening currency and not on certain other features like direct government assistance for Japanese companies to compete with foreign ones and use of policy banks to slightly repress markets and financial sector. This went against the American notion that American and Western liberal market Capitalism was superior to State Capitalism. The United States then forced Japan to strengthen the Yen which proved disastrous for Japan. The Japanese Central bank cut interest rates which worsened the excess capacity and sent much of the capital into local construction industry and real estate speculation leading ultimately to the bubble burst from which Japan never recovered.\n\nAnother important point. When the US stock market crashed in 1987, Japan directly assisted the US by buying a large amount of stocks stabilizing the financial system. This made the US implicitly dependent on the Japanese government. In 1995, the Japanese government succeeded in forcing the US to allow for weakening of yuan to boost it's exports. There was an implicit threat that Japan would pull out the support that it was providing the US by buying government bonds and other forms of investment. Japan's low-cost financing replaced America's virtual dearth of domestic savings and allowed the United States to run huge external deficits without paying any of the usual costs, particularly a catastrophic loss in value of the dollar, while keeping inflation low and American financial markets buoyant. The US agreed and that had a devastating impact on South Asia leading to the East Asian crisis because many of those countries had their currency pegged to US dollar and were also export dependent. Worse, they had carelessly liberalized their currency markets leading to a disaster.\n\nThere is more but does the 20 year rule apply , [m](https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgy_K_Zhukov)[od](https://www.reddit.com/user/commiespaceinvader)[s](https://www.reddit.com/user/sunagainstgold)?\n\nReferences:\n\nThe Japan That Can Say No by Akio Morita and Shintaro Ishihara\n\nJapanese \"Capitalism\" Revisited by Chalmers Johnson\n\n\n", "id": "dap6cwq"}], [{"comment": "Book reviews take a long time to catch up with publications.

But we actually don't know how he chose the date, because the records we have just have him talking about Easter and his year system, not why he thought Jesus was born then.\n\nThe most likely method, however, is based on the Gospel of Luke. According to Luke, the word of God came to John (the Baptist) in the wilderness in the 15th year of Emperor Tiberius. This is 29AD (or possibly 27 AD, as he reigned as co-Emperor with Augustus for 2 years before becoming sole Emperor, but that's not how Emperor's reigns were normally dated). Jesus appears in the Gospels to be baptised by John not a huge time afterwards, though no specific dates are given (a few months? A year? Two years? 5? It's not stated). Luke also says that Jesus was about 30 when he started preaching. So, if Luke is right that John started preaching in 29AD, and right that Jesus started preaching when he was 30, and this was 2 years after John started preaching, then Jesus would have been born in 1AD. So perhaps this is where Exiguus got the year.\n\nBut Luke also claims that Jesus was born during the census of Quirrinus (governor of Syria), which other sources say was in 6AD, when the area came under direct Roman rule and was integrated into the province of Syria.\n\nAnd then we have Matthew, who gives a slightly different story about Jesus's birth. Luke claims Jesus's family was from Nazareth but had to go to Bethlehem for Quirinnus's census (which is odd, as that's not generally how Roman censuses worked). But Matthew claims that Jesus was born in Bethlehem during the reign of King Herod. He says King Herod tried to kill Jesus and family, so they fled to Egypt. Eventually King Herod died, but his son Archelaus ruled in the Bethlehem area, so they had to go somewhere else; a town called Nazareth. The only Herod with a son called Archelaus was Herod the Great, who died in 4BC. Thus, Jesus must, if we go with Matthew, have been born before 4BC.\n\nBut, as you can see, the two sources don't agree. Their dates are within 10 years of 1AD, but clearly someone's made a mistake (not really surprising considering that both works were written many decades after the events, and this in a period where many ordinary people wouldn't have been able to give their exact date of birth anyway).\nAnd of course, there's the fact that both accounts may be largely fabricated to justify how a man from Nazareth could be the Messiah that many Jews thought would be from Bethlehem. So Jesus escaping from Herod the Great (showing he was born before 4BC) or Joseph and Mary going to Bethlehem for the 6AD census, may be just made up.\n\nAll we can really say is that Jesus was probably born* around the turn of AD/BC, but we can't really be specific.\n\n*This all assumes Jesus was a real person. Most scholars of the subject say he was, but it would be remiss of me not to mention that there are some scholars who think he's mythical.\n"]], [[{"comment": "I'll answer your second question; the short answer is probably neither, but we don't really know.\n\nHere's the longer answer:\nThe guy who picked the date for 1AD (when he thought Jesus was born) was a 6th century monk named Dionysius Exiguus.

Do take note that I went to school in Maryland, which is a state that has well funded schools where I had access to a large selection of courses and reading materials. I'll explain the general year-to-year structure of history education, and then answer the nuanced questions that you had in order. I'm currently a human geography student at college now, and I've only taken one history course here in my three years. I love the topic but I'm neither a major nor a minor so hopefully I can provide an 'outsider' view on the subject of history education.\n\nHistory proper began for me in middle school. Prior to this, it was rolled into a general 'social studies' curriculum, which largely took a bow to mathematics, literature and physical science education during elementary school. Art, music and literature classes did have a strong history component. I remember this focusing mostly on American history, especially colonization, the Revolution and the Civil War. At this point, students were grouped into 'merit' and 'honors' classes. There may have been supplemental or special education for a below-merit level but I didn't know if that existed directly. I was always in either an honors course or AP in history.\n\nSixth grade (11-12) history concerned early human evolution and the development of early societies. We had a few exercises on what I could now call basic social theory, trying to explain why societies and structures form and to whose benefit. Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt were then covered, along with cursory studies of China, India and the cradles of civilization in the Americas. 2012 was a little while off in 2007-2008 so it was fashionable to discuss apocalypse predictions when the Mayans came up. I think we also discussed political happenings and current events in our community and the world. It was probably Mesopotamia that got the most exposure, and there was great coverage of how early societies like that developed. I believe we stopped with Ancient Greece and Rome, as the course was only a semester long. Like with mathematics education, there was a general progression in the history education over the seven years of secondary schooling, with each year covering a broad part of history. You had more freedom to choose which history you wanted to take as you got into high school, however. \n\nIn seventh grade (12-13) we had a small recap of the origins of humans and early civilizations, and then there was a major unit on Roman history. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the rise of Christianity was discussed as well as medieval society. Not much attention was paid to the early medieval period and we jumped right into the feudalism characteristic of high medieval society. I remember there being days focused on medieval China and also a whole week on the rise of Islam and it's basic beliefs and creeds.This continued on until the early modern period, when early European colonization was discussed. The semester ended around that time.\n\nEighth grade (13-14) included early American history. We briefly went over pre-Colombian civilizations and then discussed English and later British colonization. A good deal of time was spent on the colonial period and how slavery worked and was developed. There was a lot of buildup to the American revolution and what kind of political processes went on were examined. The general view was pro-American but it was not uncritical of the revolution and it explicitly mentioned Loyalists as still being Americans and a component of American society at the time. Then there was a section on the creation of the American government and specifically the Constitution, along with the three-fifths compromise. The next section covered early expansion and the first few presidents. We moved onto the Mexican War and then there was a long section on the causes and events of the US Civil War. I remember having to prepare a report on specific battles and campaigns during the Civil War. We briefly covered Reconstruction and the semester ended. \n\nNinth grade (high school, 14-15) was not a history class but rather a government class. There was of course a lot of history included but the main focus was practical knowledge of elections, political parties, political viewpoints, ideology, trying to form a viewpoint and how the legal system works if one found oneself within. Lots of attention was given to historical documents. \n\nDuring tenth grade (15-16), you were given a choice between an honors or merit Modern History course or an AP course. Amongst AP courses you could choose AP American History, AP European History, or AP World History. I chose World History as it was geared towards sophomores. I think the basic Modern History course covered everything from where seventh grade left off, but in Europe and on a global scale. It included the Protestant Reformation, exploration etc. etc. up until World War Two. \n\nIn eleventh grade (16-17), you again had a choice between a standard course and AP. I took the standard that year because AP courses were year long and I couldn't fit one in my schedule. The topic of that honors course was Modern American History, which concerned American History from Reconstruction to the present day. That class was especially critical of a large part of American history and society, especially imperialism and industrialism. A good part was spent on the American Gilded Age and it's faults. The teacher was big on informing us of alternative viewpoints to events, and gave a very critical view of the Indian Wars which wrapped up during this period. There was a great focus on the non-American causes of the two World Wars, and recent history was given a fairly unabashed treatment. The sexual revolution was discussed as well as the emergence of modern popular culture, rock and hip-hop, etc. Interestingly, queer and LGBT history was also discussed quite a bit with Stonewall and other events during and after the 60s, which I was glad to hear. It was all very frank and I felt like the class was very open in its content."]], [[{"comment": "Hello,\n\nI graduated from a public high school in 2014 so hopefully my anecdote will be of assistance here.

The British paid them no mind until the 1870's and 1880's when large deposits gold and diamonds where discovered. and the sovereignty of the two republics began to become a hindrance to  British commercial interests as the Boer governments where as distrustful of outsiders as always(especially British ones) and had taken legal measures to limit the influx of foreign specialists and capital investment which was rapidly turning the urban centers into something the largely pastoral and agricultural Boers couldn't recognize. The republics had originally been set up as Boer ethno-states and the Afrikaners where hesitant to jeopardize this by allowing the new foreigners who worked as technical and administrative staff in the mines anything close to citizenship rights. The majority of the Afrikaners where illiterate and couldn't compete with the new English migrants for these jobs in the technical or commercial sectors, and the Voksraade (Boer parliaments) naturally sided with the local Boers and attempted to keep foreign influence at a minimum, despite British insistence that trade should be liberalized. this caused a lot of tension. The British first tried to form a federation with the Boer republics in 1875, and when this offer was turned down, summarily annexed  the two republics across the next two years. at first this was accepted, since the new republics where wedges between (and built on top) of black African homelands ruled by leaders whom the Afrikaners feared would take a Boer military defeat as a opportunity to attack or, in the latter case rebel. They thus tolerated the British presence until 1880-81 when they revolted and the first Boer War took place. The British, not wanting to be bogged down in a distant war made a shaky peace that lasted for roughly two decades before the commercial and imperial ambitions of some key figures within the Cape Colonial government led to the [Jameson raid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Raid) an unmitigated disaster worth a read of its own. \n\n**The Second Boer War and its aftermath.**\n\nThis second war that followed was a particularly bitter one, the Boers where hopelessly outmatched in the field and resorted to their old guerrilla tactics, which the British suppressed in the only real way you can, targeting Boer farms for scorched earth tactics and interning over one hundred thousand civilians both black and white in concentration camps which where hopelessly unprepared for housing such large quantities of people. Something along the lines of 20 000 Afrikaner women and children died of diseases and malnutrition, and the numbers among interned black Africans may be equal if not more. The affect on the populations of the now former republics both physical and psychological were quite profound. Huge swathes of territory had been laid waste and many families returned to their homes to find the land simply unworkable. There was some manner of compensation paid out but it was badly administered and practically insufficient and resentment against the British, as well as amongst Afrikaners as many had defected to fight for the British, which had left such a large cultural impact on them that for many decades the term \"hensopper\" (hands upper, or a person who surrenders) or \"handskakhie\" (difficult to translate, but it essentially means a pet lamb raised by \"khakies\" or the Boer slang for British soldiers) were some of the worst insults you could give someone in the Afrikaans language. Many of the new British policies where quite alienating, such as deliberate though unsuccessful attempts to make the northern republics more culturally heterogeneous through the encouragement of British immigration to the area and the suppression of the Afrikaans language in schools and other institutions Anti British feeling would boil over into action from time to time s, such as during the First World War when a Afrikaner army officer defected over to the Imperial  German side and took a band 12 000 Afrikaners with him during what was called the Maritz rebellion. \n\n**The \"poor white problem\"** \n\nNow this long diversion regarding the ethnicity of the different white groups becomes relevant when you factor in that there was a strong class distinction between them. (or at least a mentally perceived one) The Afrikaners who had moved north where largely uneducated subsistence farmers who followed the gavelkind method of land subdivision upon death and inheritance, meaning that land was equally divided between all the sons, which in families which could sometimes number as many as eight to ten children often left many sons destitute on plots of land too small to be commercially viable. In the age of the frontier this wouldn't be a problem, as one could simply move on and fight over land elsewhere, but in the 20th century with clearly demarcated borders and property rights this wasn't an option. The English farmers in contrast followed primogeniture, whereby the eldest son inherited all the property, and where often better educated and could cope better in a modern market economy. Thus when the great depression hit in the 1920's the English could take the sudden shock far better, whereas among the Afrikaners in contrast agriculture almost entirely collapsed as a viable method of economic activity and many families where forced to default on their loans migrate to the cities. where work was just as scarce and they found themselves in competition with other non skilled Africans in the countries other key industry which was mining. in  The \"poor white question\" and what to do about it was as it was to become was one of the big political debates of the time period. And was the key wave upon which the Afrikaner nationalism of the following decade would depend on.\n\nSo by the 1930's the situation is thus - you have the Afrikaners, a traditionally conservative, ethnically homogeneous group of people with a  recent cultural memory of being militarily subjugated b ya  foreign power for largely economic reasons. levels of poverty are becoming acute, and far away an old cultural ally Germany is giving this power the finger, and better yet, that power is assuring them that their Germanic ancestry actually makes them the superior race. The Nazis knew fertile soil for their ideas when they found it , and to this day there exists debate over how deep the fascistic connections went among some constituent parties that went on to coalsece under the umbrella of the national part and win the elections in 1949\n\nNaturally not all Afrikaners thought this way, many of the more established Afrikaners in the cape area remained quite liberal, and many thousands of Afrikaners who volunteered gave their life or limb in the war effort against Nazi Germany and its European allies in the deserts of North Africa or the hills and valleys of Italy. (ill freely admit this is bias on my part, since my own grandfather was one such Afrikaner who did go and fight, but i think its key to member that identity groups are never quite hive minds)\n\n**Racial legislation**\n\nNow that we've covered all that lets get to your question on racial legislation and class. The history of such dates back to long before the depression and the poor white question really took off. The first event is undoubtedly the \n[Rand revolt]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Rebellion) of 1922. An armed insurrection which saw a rag tag group of communists, Marxists and anaracho-syndicalists launch an attempt at overthrowing the government and turn South Africa into a communist state. (albeit one opposed to the use of black labour, which was a serious issue among the then already growing numbers of urban poor whites who could not compete with the low labour costs that the mining magnates where allowed to pay the black African workers.\n\n(Il discuss this further in my next section) \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "dapy0rx"}, {"comment": "Hey there everyone. \n\nMy apologies for the long delay. As it happens i originally came across this post during a bout of procrastination to avoid studying for my upcoming exams. and what began as a short post turned into an essay. Nevertheless, it seems to have gotten a good reception and id hate to let you guys down. so here goes.\n\n**The runup to the 1948 elections**\n\nNo as ive mentioned the early half of the 20th century is essentially the story of competition between two political camps in the country. the one tends to be economically and socially liberal and in favour of close ties to Britain and the commonwealth, with a largely English and liberal cape Afrikaner support base, and was backed by the countries economic establishment. This group tended to be in favour of granting non whites political and economic rights, \n\nThe other was socially conservative and economically protectionist, with a largely working class Afrikaner support base. This camp was heavily opposed to co operating with Britain and wanted South Africa to have full independence. \n\nThe irony is that both these groups where dominated by Afrikaans speakers in their leadership, and between 1934-1948 shared administration of the country in a coalition government under the [United Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Party_(South_Africa))\n\nThough the differences between the liberals and the conservatives were often large, the fear that the country could be split by a large scale Afrikaner rebellion was enough that they decided to work together, and though they incessantly bickered over racial legislation and nearly came to blows over whether or not south Africa should join the war against the axis powers for example, the coalition held all through the war years and kept the country from becoming another front between the axis and allied powers.\n\n\n\nUltimately it couldn't be permanent however. The unity government struggled to come to grips with the poverty problem and seemed far to pro British for the  Afrikaner population that still had not gotten over its mistrust of the British and at the turn of the decade between the 1930's and 40's was undergoing a surge in nationalism like never before. This was a time when young women like my grandmother could be disinherited for dating men from English families and  when the countries campuses where frequently wracked by running battles between pro and anti British youth gangs. in 1938 a mass rally on the centenary of the great trek saw a crowd of 100 000 strong congregate in Pretoria to witness the opening of the Voortrekker Monument which celebrated it. The Afrikaans language underwent a cultural renaissance as the volume of literary works and newspapers published in the language greatly increased. this era saw the founding of many non governmental organisations geared towards the promotion of Afrikaans culture and the increase of Afrikaner clout in general public life. Much of this was organised and orchestrated by the [Broederbond]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner_Broederbond) A Free-mason like secret society which sought to establish Afrikaner dominance over the country and was instrumental in the formation of the breakaway National Party and the formation of the Apartheid system.  Afrikaners were the majority of the white population, and so wherever they voted the country went. The liberals in the United Party couldn't construct a political narrative robust enough to counter Verowoerd and the National Parties populist message of a state of Afrikaners for Afrikaners and so they were ultimately doomed to fail in the general elections of 1947.

My understanding is that divorce was acceptable in during Roman times, but unacceptable during the medieval period.  If that's right, then how and why did that shift from ~400 to ~1200 AD?"], [12, "Scholars today aren't even sure that Charlemagne married Desiderata, although marriage was seriously discussed sometime around 770. The *Royal Frankish Annals*, which seem to have been first compiled in the Frankish court around 790, recorded that Charlemagne's mom went to Italy, and a slightly later chronicle (*Annales Mosellani*, ca. 797) report that she met with the Lombard king to mediate Lombard relations with the pope and \"led the daughter Desiderata to Francia.\"\n\nBut the pope didn't like this part of the plan. In 770 or 771, Pope Stephen III (r. 768-772) wrote to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman. It had come to his attention:\n\n> The daughter of Desiderius is to be joined in matrimony to one of you brothers, and if indeed this is so, then it is certainly an entry of the devil\u2014not a joining of matrimony but rather seeming a consort of gross iniquity, since we have condemned many, as the stories of holy scripture have taught us, for departing from the mandate of God and to have decayed into great dissolution through a wicked bond with an alien nation.\n\nWhoa. Why such ire? Well, an alliance between Charlemagne's family and the Lombards would seriously disrupt the balance of power in Italy. Every time the Lombards became to aggressive to the pope and his lands, the pope could call upon the Franks to hit them on their flank. But if the Lombards and Franks were allied by marriage, the pope was without a defender. As almost a side note, the pope notes that both brothers already had Frankish wives\u2014\"and certainly it is not permitted that you should dismiss these so that you can take other wives or mix in consanguinity with outside nations.\"\n\nThese sources leave historians with two problems: (1) Who was Desiderata supposed to marry? and (2) Did the marriage ever take place. For the first question, on the one hand, we know that Charlemagne was (or would at least later be) interested in having positive relations with the pope. On the other, the pope actually lavished further letters on Carloman, consoling his wife and offering to baptize her son. I think these facts suggest that Charlemagne was not actually the focus of the pope's concern, and that Carloman was actually the main person of interest in marriage negotiations with the Lombard family.\n\nFor the second question, the earliest report that a marriage actually occurred between Desiderata and a Frankish king is found in Einhard's *Life of Charlemagne*, written sometime after Charlemagne's death, perhaps ca. 817.

Einhard's list of Charlemagne's family, although it's the most complete, varies slightly from other sources. He seems to have had the best access to the royal archives, which he used to piece together Charlemagne's early years before Einhard came to the court and could count himself as an eyewitness to events. Nevertheless, Einhard wasn't terribly interested in Charlemagne's early years, and he gets some facts wrong in the early chapters. His supposed marriage to Desiderata could be another such case.

Charlemagne had several illegitimate children through these kinds of relationships, and once his son Louis the Pious took over the empire, he made sure that all his illegitimate half-siblings were handed over to the church, where a few of them became important abbots and nuns.\n\nLooking back at Pope Stephen's letter, he seems to have discouraged this kind of behavior on principle (it's not permitted to dismiss your wives) but he actually seems more concerned with the reasoning behind it (so that you can take other wives who will mix you up with a foreign people). To me, this sounds like a tacit acknowledgement that the church could not forbid divorce; that if the church wanted to have an influence over Frankish politics, it needed to accept that Frankish marriages were part of the political structures and were therefore much more fluid than a good bishop might like to see; and that every time a wife or consort was set aside, her children could be effectively conscripted into the church, strengthening ties between the royal family and ecclesiastical power.\n\n---\n\nFurther reading:\n\nRosamond McKitterick, *Charlemagne: The Formation of a European Identity* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008).\n\nJanet L.

The *Royal Frankish Annals*, which seem to have been first compiled in the Frankish court around 790, recorded that Charlemagne's mom went to Italy, and a slightly later chronicle (*Annales Mosellani*, ca. 797) report that she met with the Lombard king to mediate Lombard relations with the pope and \"led the daughter Desiderata to Francia.\"\n\nBut the pope didn't like this part of the plan. In 770 or 771, Pope Stephen III (r. 768-772) wrote to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman. It had come to his attention:\n\n> The daughter of Desiderius is to be joined in matrimony to one of you brothers, and if indeed this is so, then it is certainly an entry of the devil\u2014not a joining of matrimony but rather seeming a consort of gross iniquity, since we have condemned many, as the stories of holy scripture have taught us, for departing from the mandate of God and to have decayed into great dissolution through a wicked bond with an alien nation.\n\nWhoa. Why such ire? Well, an alliance between Charlemagne's family and the Lombards would seriously disrupt the balance of power in Italy. Every time the Lombards became to aggressive to the pope and his lands, the pope could call upon the Franks to hit them on their flank. But if the Lombards and Franks were allied by marriage, the pope was without a defender. As almost a side note, the pope notes that both brothers already had Frankish wives\u2014\"and certainly it is not permitted that you should dismiss these so that you can take other wives or mix in consanguinity with outside nations.\"\n\nThese sources leave historians with two problems: (1) Who was Desiderata supposed to marry? and (2) Did the marriage ever take place. For the first question, on the one hand, we know that Charlemagne was (or would at least later be) interested in having positive relations with the pope. On the other, the pope actually lavished further letters on Carloman, consoling his wife and offering to baptize her son. I think these facts suggest that Charlemagne was not actually the focus of the pope's concern, and that Carloman was actually the main person of interest in marriage negotiations with the Lombard family.\n\nFor the second question, the earliest report that a marriage actually occurred between Desiderata and a Frankish king is found in Einhard's *Life of Charlemagne*, written sometime after Charlemagne's death, perhaps ca. 817. In a summary chapter of Charlemagne's marriages, he includes \"the daughter of Desiderius\" in his list. There's good reason not to place too much trust in his list. Einhard's list of Charlemagne's family, although it's the most complete, varies slightly from other sources.

If you want to read about the Roman world and Roman society, rather than just Roman military campaigns with the necessary background information about society and whatnot supplied, Goldsworthy's not the place to go, although it's certainly a better introduction to the subject than Holland.

The early years focus on the study of what might be termed \"sample events and people\" - examples given are The Great Fire of London or the Wright Brothers and flight; these are supposed to be paired together so one part focuses on long ago and the other \"within living memory\" - so for example, study of the history of exploration by looking at Christopher Columbus and Neil Armstrong. It's only at about age 8 that the long trek from Stonehenge to Sarajevo actually begins.\n\nTypically a student who gives up the subject at 14 would have spent a lot of their time looking at:\n\n* Roman Britain\n\n* The Vikings\n\n* The Norman Conquest\n\n* The Tudors\n\n* The Industrial Revolution plus reforms and democratisation over the period 1815-1914\n\nAll this cues up a \"GCSE\" - the British national qualification studied by those aged 15-16 - in what is in about 95% of cases 20th Century World History. The GCSE is offered by several different exam boards, so the course is not absolutely uniform, but it is always split into 3 units so that students do 2 \"depth studies\", one on a British topic (typically \"How was British society changed,1890-1918?\" or \"How far did British society change, 1939\u20131975?\") and one on a world history topic, selected from a broader range of possibles (such as the Nazi state, or Communist China). They are also examined on one core element, which is international relations in either the inter-war period 1919-39, or the post war period 1945-2000.\n\nThe small minority whose schools opt for \"History A\" rather than \"History B\" (I've never found a school that offered a choice between these courses) take a less proscriptive, but perhaps more imaginative, course of study. For example the AQA exam board requires a choice between \"Medicine through time\" (meaning from Stone Age healing, via Galen, the Black Death, Snow, Pasteur and Fleming to the introduction of the National Health Service) or \"Media through time\", plus a depth study that could be The American West, Elizabethan England, Britain 1815-51 or Germany 1919-45, and a \"Historical Enquiry\" study that teaches basic historiography.\n\nAt Key Stage 5 (ages 17-18), called \"A-level\", a very wide range of papers is on offer, and recent reform has seen some imaginative changes that foreground world history to a greater extent - students now study one British, one European or American and additionally one world history paper (the latter being admittedly worth only 15% of the marks). The world history selection is quite exciting and includes topics such as \"Genghis Khan and the explosion from the Steppes, c.1167-1405, \"The rise of Islam c.550-750\" and \"African Kingdoms c.1400-1800\".  \n\nThe selections of British and European/American papers are typically very comprehensive and cover everything from Alfred the Great to Tony Blair, in the former case .... but in practice the decision on what to teach is taken by teachers and the combination of what they know, what they think their students will be interested in, and what will be taken seriously by parents means that only a few dozen students a year study papers such as \"The Reign of Justinian.\" The vast majority are funnelled towards a choice that will almost always feature a decision between the Tudors (\"Rebellion and Disorder Under the Tudors\" or \"Mid-Tudor Crises\" papers are typical) or 20th century history, and in bigger schools might add the Norman-Angevin and 19th century periods.\n\nFinally, A level students are also required to submit two 2,000 word depth studies, one a source criticism and the other a long essay on a specified topic, chosen from a list of 6-10 such topics. An example might be \"To what extent was the policy of Philip II of Spain restricted by royal finances?\" Students are expected to do their own reading to complete such essays and supply a bibliography - there's no text book at this stage.\n\nBy far the biggest change that has taken place in British school history education since I went through the system in the 1970s is a massively larger focus on teaching historical analysis and historiography. I wasn't let loose on a primary source till my third year at university. Nowadays source analysis is featured even in Key Stage 3, and it is examined at both GCSE and A level - a massive improvement, in my opinion. Gone are the broad, un-themed, chronological papers of yesteryear - my A-level consisted of one paper on European history 1600-1800 and one on British history over the same timeframe.\n\nAll of the above is based on the UK national curriculum, which sets out what should be studied and what learning outcomes are expected across the whole of the period from ages 5-18. (And I note in passing that while Britain is certainly not immune from political pressures to recast the study of history as a national epic of identity-forming and achievement that plugs into efforts to create \"citizens\", rather than prioritising independent, critical study, for the time being at least the curriculum stresses independent study and critical thinking.)\n\nThe over-arching goal is summarised as follows:\n\n>A high-quality history education will help pupils gain a coherent knowledge and understanding of Britain\u2019s past and that of the wider world. It should inspire pupils\u2019 curiosity to know more about the past. Teaching should equip pupils to ask perceptive questions, think critically, weigh evidence, sift arguments, and develop perspective and judgement. History helps pupils to understand the complexity of people\u2019s lives, the process of change, the diversity of societies and relationships between different groups, as well as their own identity and the challenges of their time.\n"], [3, "I'd also like to ask Americans what state they live and how far their high school US history class got before the end of the year.

The early years focus on the study of what might be termed \"sample events and people\" - examples given are The Great Fire of London or the Wright Brothers and flight; these are supposed to be paired together so one part focuses on long ago and the other \"within living memory\" - so for example, study of the history of exploration by looking at Christopher Columbus and Neil Armstrong. It's only at about age 8 that the long trek from Stonehenge to Sarajevo actually begins.\n\nTypically a student who gives up the subject at 14 would have spent a lot of their time looking at:\n\n* Roman Britain\n\n* The Vikings\n\n* The Norman Conquest\n\n* The Tudors\n\n* The Industrial Revolution plus reforms and democratisation over the period 1815-1914\n\nAll this cues up a \"GCSE\" - the British national qualification studied by those aged 15-16 - in what is in about 95% of cases 20th Century World History. The GCSE is offered by several different exam boards, so the course is not absolutely uniform, but it is always split into 3 units so that students do 2 \"depth studies\", one on a British topic (typically \"How was British society changed,1890-1918?\" or \"How far did British society change, 1939\u20131975?\") and one on a world history topic, selected from a broader range of possibles (such as the Nazi state, or Communist China). They are also examined on one core element, which is international relations in either the inter-war period 1919-39, or the post war period 1945-2000.\n\nThe small minority whose schools opt for \"History A\" rather than \"History B\" (I've never found a school that offered a choice between these courses) take a less proscriptive, but perhaps more imaginative, course of study. For example the AQA exam board requires a choice between \"Medicine through time\" (meaning from Stone Age healing, via Galen, the Black Death, Snow, Pasteur and Fleming to the introduction of the National Health Service) or \"Media through time\", plus a depth study that could be The American West, Elizabethan England, Britain 1815-51 or Germany 1919-45, and a \"Historical Enquiry\" study that teaches basic historiography.\n\nAt Key Stage 5 (ages 17-18), called \"A-level\", a very wide range of papers is on offer, and recent reform has seen some imaginative changes that foreground world history to a greater extent - students now study one British, one European or American and additionally one world history paper (the latter being admittedly worth only 15% of the marks). The world history selection is quite exciting and includes topics such as \"Genghis Khan and the explosion from the Steppes, c.1167-1405, \"The rise of Islam c.550-750\" and \"African Kingdoms c.1400-1800\".  \n\nThe selections of British and European/American papers are typically very comprehensive and cover everything from Alfred the Great to Tony Blair, in the former case .... but in practice the decision on what to teach is taken by teachers and the combination of what they know, what they think their students will be interested in, and what will be taken seriously by parents means that only a few dozen students a year study papers such as \"The Reign of Justinian.\" The vast majority are funnelled towards a choice that will almost always feature a decision between the Tudors (\"Rebellion and Disorder Under the Tudors\" or \"Mid-Tudor Crises\" papers are typical) or 20th century history, and in bigger schools might add the Norman-Angevin and 19th century periods.\n\nFinally, A level students are also required to submit two 2,000 word depth studies, one a source criticism and the other a long essay on a specified topic, chosen from a list of 6-10 such topics. An example might be \"To what extent was the policy of Philip II of Spain restricted by royal finances?\" Students are expected to do their own reading to complete such essays and supply a bibliography - there's no text book at this stage.\n\nBy far the biggest change that has taken place in British school history education since I went through the system in the 1970s is a massively larger focus on teaching historical analysis and historiography. I wasn't let loose on a primary source till my third year at university. Nowadays source analysis is featured even in Key Stage 3, and it is examined at both GCSE and A level - a massive improvement, in my opinion. Gone are the broad, un-themed, chronological papers of yesteryear - my A-level consisted of one paper on European history 1600-1800 and one on British history over the same timeframe.\n\nAll of the above is based on the UK national curriculum, which sets out what should be studied and what learning outcomes are expected across the whole of the period from ages 5-18. (And I note in passing that while Britain is certainly not immune from political pressures to recast the study of history as a national epic of identity-forming and achievement that plugs into efforts to create \"citizens\", rather than prioritising independent, critical study, for the time being at least the curriculum stresses independent study and critical thinking.)\n\nThe over-arching goal is summarised as follows:\n\n>A high-quality history education will help pupils gain a coherent knowledge and understanding of Britain\u2019s past and that of the wider world. It should inspire pupils\u2019 curiosity to know more about the past. Teaching should equip pupils to ask perceptive questions, think critically, weigh evidence, sift arguments, and develop perspective and judgement. History helps pupils to understand the complexity of people\u2019s lives, the process of change, the diversity of societies and relationships between different groups, as well as their own identity and the challenges of their time.\n", "id": "dapb2lk"}, {"comment": "this is an excellent summary.

It took silencing about 300 newspapers, locking up 14-30 thousand citizens who were against the war, the suspension of the Habeas Corpus, deportation of an elected Congressman.  \n* Continuing resistance to the conduct of the war. Later on there always was a lingering suspicion that the Army of the Potomac does not really want to fight the Army of Northern Virginia until the complete destruction, being full of conservative officers who looked for the negotiated settlement of the war. The most known of them were Major General George B. McClellan, former general in chief and commander of the Army of the Potomac and Major General George G. Meade commander of the Army of the Potomac. They were both suspected to be little less than traitors by the Republican Party politicians who were mainly radicals and therefor also strongly pro-war minded. Both were investigated by the United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War which were dominated by radical Republicans, who tried to remove them from command.\nFor example regarding why the Army of the Potomac did not try to finish off Lee's army after the battle of Antietam (Sept. 17, 1862) George S. Maharay (and I'm sure metric tonnes of other works mention it too) wrote in the The Ever-Changing Leaders and Organization of the Army of the Potomac p. 63:\n\u2019Major John Key, a member of Halleck's staff had an answer for the inaction on the eighteenth. Key was the brother of Colonel Key of McClellan's staff; the officer who had talked about settlement of the conflict with Confederate General Howell Cobb during the Peninsula Campaign. Major Key reported a conspiracy theory, one that Lincoln chose not to ignore. Major Key told the judge advocate of the War Deaprtment taht the pursuit and destruction of the Rebel army \"was not the game.\" He continued, \"the object [of the game] is that neither army shall get much advantage of the other, that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhauseted, when we will make a compromise and save slavery.\" Upon hearing this, Lincoln personally interviewed Major Key on the September 27. And when Major Key confirmed his remarks, Lincoln dismissed him from service, and said that he acted \"because I found it was staff talk and I wanted an example.\"'  \n* Military victory of the Confederacy. There was no hope at all for that but as many-many historias (like Gary Gallagher) have pointed out a draw would have been enough for the Confederacy. If they had managed only to exist on until they could have been disregarded no more, they would have won. Were there any chance of the draw? Grant wrote in his memoires that if the Confederacy had held out for another year the northern population would have probably abandoned the war effort and made peace. The margin for military errors were small to begin with and despite the Confederacy made heroic efforts to prop itself up for waging this terrible war, it proved to be insufficent. Were there any signs of the exhaustion of the Union? Yes, there were, the desertion of the soldiers, the population moving to Canada to escape the war, the growing dissatisfaction with the growing casualties. But it all was just not enough.  \n* Political fall of the hawkish factions. The election of 1864 looked very promising for the Democrats until August or September of 1864. The sacking of Lincoln was more or less sure because of the hugely demoralizing casualities coming from the Eastern Theater of the war. The Republican party did not want to nominate Lincoln at all; instead they tried to line up behind John C. Fr\u00e9mont as a radical candidate. Grant was considered for a while as nominee until he shut down the speculations first by supporting Lincoln then by gaining the epithet \u201ethe Butcher\u201d with his conduct of the war int he Overland Campaign. So the Lincoln-supporters were actually forced to create a National Union party ticket joined by some War Democrats. As the War Democrats supported Lincoln, the Democratic Party platform would neccessarily be a peace platform and nominated the still immensly popular McClellan. McClellan could not give a comprehensive explanation how can he still be pro-war if the party stands up for peace buti t all would not have been enough if William T. Sherman had not taken Atlanta in September and the radical Republicans had not abandoned Fr\u00e9mont in fear of McClellan\u2019s predictable win. Lincoln was so sure of his demise that  on August 23 he prepared the enigmatical cabinet memorandum: \u201eThis morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.\u201d see Allen Carl Guelzo\u2019s speech at the Sacred Trust Talks in 2014.  \n* Coup d\u2019\u00c9tat. We don\u2019t have too much about this possibility, but we know that McClellan vented out some frustration in his letters he wrote to her wife. One of them contains remarks about \u2019taking my boys to Washington to check on what is going on there\u2019. On another account he held conversations with three other generals of the Army of the Potomac at dinner, when he mentioned that some others encouraged him to take decisive action with the help of his loyal friends.

They were both suspected to be little less than traitors by the Republican Party politicians who were mainly radicals and therefor also strongly pro-war minded. Both were investigated by the United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War which were dominated by radical Republicans, who tried to remove them from command.\nFor example regarding why the Army of the Potomac did not try to finish off Lee's army after the battle of Antietam (Sept. 17, 1862) George S. Maharay (and I'm sure metric tonnes of other works mention it too) wrote in the The Ever-Changing Leaders and Organization of the Army of the Potomac p. 63:\n\u2019Major John Key, a member of Halleck's staff had an answer for the inaction on the eighteenth. Key was the brother of Colonel Key of McClellan's staff; the officer who had talked about settlement of the conflict with Confederate General Howell Cobb during the Peninsula Campaign. Major Key reported a conspiracy theory, one that Lincoln chose not to ignore. Major Key told the judge advocate of the War Deaprtment taht the pursuit and destruction of the Rebel army \"was not the game.\" He continued, \"the object [of the game] is that neither army shall get much advantage of the other, that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhauseted, when we will make a compromise and save slavery.\" Upon hearing this, Lincoln personally interviewed Major Key on the September 27. And when Major Key confirmed his remarks, Lincoln dismissed him from service, and said that he acted \"because I found it was staff talk and I wanted an example.\"'  \n* Military victory of the Confederacy. There was no hope at all for that but as many-many historias (like Gary Gallagher) have pointed out a draw would have been enough for the Confederacy. If they had managed only to exist on until they could have been disregarded no more, they would have won. Were there any chance of the draw? Grant wrote in his memoires that if the Confederacy had held out for another year the northern population would have probably abandoned the war effort and made peace. The margin for military errors were small to begin with and despite the Confederacy made heroic efforts to prop itself up for waging this terrible war, it proved to be insufficent. Were there any signs of the exhaustion of the Union? Yes, there were, the desertion of the soldiers, the population moving to Canada to escape the war, the growing dissatisfaction with the growing casualties. But it all was just not enough.  \n* Political fall of the hawkish factions. The election of 1864 looked very promising for the Democrats until August or September of 1864. The sacking of Lincoln was more or less sure because of the hugely demoralizing casualities coming from the Eastern Theater of the war. The Republican party did not want to nominate Lincoln at all; instead they tried to line up behind John C. Fr\u00e9mont as a radical candidate. Grant was considered for a while as nominee until he shut down the speculations first by supporting Lincoln then by gaining the epithet \u201ethe Butcher\u201d with his conduct of the war int he Overland Campaign. So the Lincoln-supporters were actually forced to create a National Union party ticket joined by some War Democrats. As the War Democrats supported Lincoln, the Democratic Party platform would neccessarily be a peace platform and nominated the still immensly popular McClellan. McClellan could not give a comprehensive explanation how can he still be pro-war if the party stands up for peace buti t all would not have been enough if William T. Sherman had not taken Atlanta in September and the radical Republicans had not abandoned Fr\u00e9mont in fear of McClellan\u2019s predictable win. Lincoln was so sure of his demise that  on August 23 he prepared the enigmatical cabinet memorandum: \u201eThis morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.\u201d see Allen Carl Guelzo\u2019s speech at the Sacred Trust Talks in 2014.  \n* Coup d\u2019\u00c9tat. We don\u2019t have too much about this possibility, but we know that McClellan vented out some frustration in his letters he wrote to her wife. One of them contains remarks about \u2019taking my boys to Washington to check on what is going on there\u2019. On another account he held conversations with three other generals of the Army of the Potomac at dinner, when he mentioned that some others encouraged him to take decisive action with the help of his loyal friends. That was after the Emancipation Proclamation was announced which made the conservative McClellan furious.

But, these acts became the first true rock acts as we consider them; And, this moves on down the line evolving with the British Invasion, then hard rock and finally alt rock. \n\nNow, when Elvis came along and made that split, he effectively alienated the entirety of the groups making what would be considered rock music, talking in comparison to his work. These groups, eventually formed the genres of Soul, disco, and R&B, which in reality are all rock music, just made in a different that evolved in another direction; like how we evolved from apes that still exist today. \n\n\nEdit: To actually to the point answer this; there were black rock acts (jimmy Hendrix, chuck berry), but the money and promotion was behind the white groups, so they would have done much better, much easier than black rock groups.

And it should be pointed out that rock and roll existed well before 1954-55 when Chess and Sun hit the mainstream, so these only pick up the story when rock and roll became a pop culture phenomenon. I don't know of any comprehensive texts that covers the period of 1945-55, when guitars went electric and records like Arthur 'Big Boy' Crudup's \"That's All Right (Mama)\"  were being released.\n\nThere is a series on DVD called \"The History of Rock & Roll\" that isn't all that good. There was another series that aired on PBS back in the late 1990s simply called \"[Rock & Roll](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291656/?ref_=tt_ov_inf)\" that was better but still wasn't all that great. Unfortunately, it was only ever released on VHS.\n\nThe BBC also put out a number of episodes of a show called \"Rock Family Trees\" that covers a lot of ground.

He was also one of the most staunch defenders of this show. His biography mentions that after the show first aired and press articles brought up the issue if it was ok to have a show set in a German camp, he toured several Veteran's associations to talk to WWII vets. By all accounts, most the response was overwhelmingly positive. In 1968 he said in an interview: \"The ex-POWs in Albuquerque, NM, have an association. They had a convention and invited me. A lot of POWs are hooked on Hogan's Heroes. They're our biggest rooters--along with New York Jewish delicatessen owners!\"\"\n\nThe other important defender of the show that convinced a lot of people that Hogan's Heroes didn't have some sort of malicious or bad intent was Robert Clary, who portrayed Loius LeBeau on the show. Clary was a Holocaust survivor. Born a French Jew, he was rounded up and deported by the Germans to Buchenwald where he was liberated while also losing several family members in Auschwitz. Also, on the shows cast was Werner Klemperer (Klink), who was the son of ~~Viktor Klemperer, a linguist and Jewish survivor of Nazi Germany~~ Otto Klemperer, a famous composer who fled Germany in 1935.

During WWII both Charlie Chaplin and Ernst Lubtisch had used this method of making ridicule of the Nazis while implying their brutality to great effect in films like the Great Dictator and To Be or Not to Be.

As Lisa M. Mundley discusses in her book *American Militarism and Anti-Militarism in Popular Media, 1945-1970*, 2012, Hogan's Heroes is a show that belongs into the category of the \"war as adventure\" genre. Hogan's tells the story of a communal effort to defeat an enemy that is bumbling at times but nonetheless dangerous (the Gestapo in the show is a moniker for the dangers of the Germans). It even went so far as to try introduce a Soviet POW but that proved not possible in the Cold War climate and the character disappeared again.\n\nHowever, what is important about the show and its telling of WWII as an adventure where sharp wit and intelligence can beat a bumbling but at times nonetheless dangerous enemy is that it hit a nerve with its portrayal of a group of allied people coming together to beat an evil enemy. An enemy that nonetheless can be understood and ridiculed. At the time, this was difficult to do with the North Vietnamese since they had a greater degree of \"otherness\" and because the war in Vietnam, unlike WWII, did not inspire the same feeling of fighting a \"good war\" in the public. While broad swaths would have seen it as justified maybe, there still was controversy around the war itself to a measure that was not associated with WWII.\n\nHogan's was only one product of that particular wave of entertainment.

Also just some context for [what Europe looked like](https://mapcollection.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/europeprewwi.jpg).\n\nThe Ottoman administrative divisions of Syria are confusing, [**this**](http://www.zum.de/whkmla/histatlas/arabworld/ottsyr19061914text.gif) is probably the best one I've come across. NB: basically the colors here represent top-level provinces/states/wilayets, while the letters show the sub-level districts. The exceptions are Jerusalem and Lebanon, which were top-level and separate. Also as is shown [on this map](https://sullydish.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/mapa_osmanian_empire_22_02.jpg),  the city of Beirut would have been part of the vilayet of Beirut despite being surrounded by the mutasarrifate of Lebanon.\n\nFor the Damascus Protocol, you can see the text of the Arab claim [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_Protocol#The_Text) which roughly corresponds to [this entire territory](https://wirajhanaeka.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/858b9-damascusprotocolmap.gif), this map includes the British caveats in the Hussein McMahon correspondences, though as I discuss even those are disputable.\n\nThe original Sykes-Picot map can be seen [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/MPK1-426_Sykes_Picot_Agreement_Map_signed_8_May_1916.jpg). The un-shaded A and B areas would be under each country's respective sphere of influence but would otherwise be nominally \"independent.\" You can also see Sykes and Picot's signatures in the bottom right.

He noted, for example, that it is at this time that senators regularly became or tried to become emperors; an indication not of apathy, but an active engagement in the political affairs of the time. Even before then, senators continued to receive important offices (prefects of the city, governor of North Africa etc), so it would be incorrect to underestimate their influence and hold on power.

(Cullen Murphy, *Are We Rome?*) And it should be noted that Scheidel's paper is about population levels in Italy as a whole, and has very little to say about the population of Rome itself.

(Seriously. The dude almost exclusively used books from the 50s and 60s, with a few outliers in the 30s and 80s. Everything he says was extremely outdated even in the 90s when he wrote it.)

The emperor Claudius was somewhat infamous for this, his general persona was that of a Republican magistrate and he was perhaps the only one of the emperors to really take his Republican offices seriously. He had a habit of spending all day on court cases, and was an extremely energetic censor. Ancient authors were somewhat divided on this: Suetonius generally notes with approval his administrative reforms in a single short section (14), and then goes on in great detail criticizing the particularities of his judgments. It is pretty funny too, by the way, particularly if you are familiar with the general literary culture of the time you can see how it becomes a parody of Claudius' pretensions.

The emperor Claudius was somewhat infamous for this, his general persona was that of a Republican magistrate and he was perhaps the only one of the emperors to really take his Republican offices seriously. He had a habit of spending all day on court cases, and was an extremely energetic censor. Ancient authors were somewhat divided on this: Suetonius generally notes with approval his administrative reforms in a single short section (14), and then goes on in great detail criticizing the particularities of his judgments.

The concept of gold as the sole or primary store of wealth is a fundamentally modern one. That's an idea based on monetary principles. Your wealth is money, and ancient people used gold for money, so ancient wealth is just lots of gold. This idea is based substantially on industrial era concepts of money, wealth, and economics. In the industrial era it's feasible to keep all your wealth in some form of exchange, such as dollars or gold, because of the existence of markets with plentiful production, so it's a relatively simple matter to procure anything you need by exchanging money for it (most of the time anyway). Need food? You can simply buy it as desired. Need housing? You can stay in a luxury hotel, or you can buy a house, land, etc. whenever you desire. Need to go somewhere? You can purchase a journey to anywhere on Earth most any time you want. Need entertainment? Also freely available. Cars. Clothes. Staff. Yachts. Horses. Guns. Furniture. There's a market for all of them, and they can be had as desired.\n\nBut older economies didn't work that way. They weren't built on mass production, ubiquitous global trade, and liquid markets. Imagine you are an emperor, king, or what-have-you with a mountain of gold in your treasury and then one day you run out of food in your palace. You may not be able to buy as much food as you need because it may not be available on the open market in sufficient quantities. You might have to go conquer someone else to take their food to avoid starving. Or less dramatically, imagine you wish to throw a party and you need a lot of wine. You can't simply go down to the wine shop and pick up enough wine for hundreds of guests on a moment's notice.\n\nAncient wealth was often in the form of goods (and staff). Storehouses filled with grain, honey, wine, pens filled with cows and pigs, and so forth. Buildings filled with servants (and/or slaves). Gold certainly played an important part in the wealth of ancient rulers, but it's important to understand that so much of ancient wealth was basically emulating the abundance and market availability we have today through elites controlling warehouses full of stuff ready at hand. This is one reason why palaces were so significant.

It was only for a period, in the South, that this was questioned, and this has way more to do with the economics of the time than anything relating to origins or genetic heritage.\n\nI should point out that the idea of a Han ethnicity is not actually, strictly speaking, an entirely modern construct. There is actually a good correlation between genetic descent and the groups who today self-identify as Han, including the Hakka. That said, it's a *very* broad category, and one which really only became as significant as it is due to it's contrast to the \"Other\", in the case of late Qing being the Manchus. Han is in this sense a construct in the way \"White\" is in the United States, where it came to it's modern meaning only after first serving the role as \"Us\" in contrast to whomever else was around, be it the Irish, the Chinese, or whoever else. Today some think of \"White\" as this clear-cut thing. Historically, the definition of who was included changed over time.\n\nAnd if we're going to look at groupings such as China's 56 ethnicities/nationalities, then the artificiality nature is all the more stark, especially with classifications such as *Hui* \u56de which previously just meant \"Muslim\" or \"Middle Easterner\" but in the mid-20th century became a concrete classification for Chinese-looking Muslims with a specific backstory, as such recognition became a useful thing for the aspiring government at the time. Even more starkly the *Gaoshan* \u9ad8\u5c71 ethnic grouping, which is actually a combination of highly disparate Austronesian groups, not even with all of them being Formosan. But in the PRC they are grouped into a single category.\n\nAnyway, back to the question at hand. First, it's important to understand that \"Han\" has always had a large number of various sub-ethnicities, though for most the distinctiveness has faded in recent decades. Previously, you would have Cantonese and Wu as comparable sub-groups. Hakka is such a subgroup, but in many ways still a distinct ethnicity within that. They differ from other Han groups in language, culture, dress, food and history \u2014 as do many others such as the Cantonese \u2014 but have two things going for the preservation of their identity. First, by working to preserve it, and second, by being so consistently marginalised in Chinese history. Had similar things happened around the Yangzte Delta, we might instead be asking about when the Wu came to be acknowledged as Han.\n\nThe question of the Han-ness of the Hakka people is a big one, and one that's caused no small amount of conflict, especially in the Late Qing. At that time, the efforts were to get people to learn about their native places as an effort to get them to see their place in the Great Qing and therefore feel more patriotic as a nation. This policy was known as \"from near to far\" (\u7531\u8fd1\u800c\u9060). It didn't work out well for the Qing court in the end. The idea, to teach history starting in the home with \"native-place histories\" (\u9109\u571f\u6559\u79d1\u66f8 and \u9109\u571f\u5fd7) and then spreading outward to the whole of the Empire, may have been well-intentioned and *was* ultimately good for getting local history down, but it turned into an opportunity for regional identity politics to become much bigger, as they were now being written about in the local histories being used for educating people.\n\nIn places like Guangdong, there were non-Hakka prople writing about Hakka as unwelcome outsiders who weren't Han. Instead the Hakka were grouped with various other not-so-well-liked groups (like the *She* \u7572 and *Dan* \u8711/\u6c34\u4e0a\u4eba and also Muslims), coming in, taking jobs, taking land, and diluting the language and culture. They were specifically designated along with the Hoklo and Dan as \"those coming from outside\" in some of these texts. This caused no amount of conflict between the Hakka and non-Hakka, and many Hakka writers/historians/etc began publishing their own accounts, saying that the Hakka were Han, and yes they came from the North but were still Han. \n\nThe Hakka and Cantonese were at odds throughout the 19th century, and these native place texts were really just the tail end of a half century of conflict, at times breaking out into wars.\n\nLater, in the 1930s, a scholar by the name of Lo, Hsiang-lin (\u7f85\u9999\u6797) wrote on the origins of the Hakka (\u5ba2\u5bb6\u6e90\u6d41\u8003), and while he wasn't the first, he is the most well known. By this time things had settled considerably, and in the 20th century the question of the Hakka being Han was, at least politically, a settled issue. There have been some DNA studies recently confirming this, because it's still a touchy enough subject that people feel the need to prove it with genetic testing. \n\nSo one might ask why the Hakka have been considered *not* Han by some peoeple. In the 1800s there was a series of conflicts known as the Hakka-Punti Clan Wars. Punti here is \u672c\u5730\u4eba, meaning local people, meaning Cantonese. This started in large part due to a complicated system of land ownership. One person was the owner of the land, and another was the owner of the surface soil. The land owner would have to pay the government taxes. The soil owner could keep their crops but then had to pay a tax to the land owner. In just about every case (actually every single case I've ever read about), it was the locals (Punti) who owned the land, since they'd come earlier, and the Hakka and another group known as the Pengmin would buy (if they could afford to) soil rights. The reason this was possible was because most of the land ownership was distributed generations earlier, and the owners rarely lived or farmed on what they owned. The Hakka/Pengmin/etc meanwhile needed land to farm, so the land owners were usually happy to sell off soil rights in order to make a quick buck.\n\nAdd to this that the 1800s were a horrible time for South China. You had famines (1810, 1811, 1846, 1849), piracy on the coast, and the first Opium War (1839-1842). The Punti-Hakka Clan Wars (1855 to 1867) \u2014 which were fought even on the Malay Peninsula, that's how strong the animosity was \u2014 were basically the result of the land ownership system creating great wealth for the Hakka at the cost of the Cantonese who saw the Hakka as outsiders. It was with *this* as the background that the issue of native-place schooling. Prior to this there wouldn't be much reason to consider the Hakka as not being Han. They came from the Central Plains. They spoke a Sinitic langauge very closely related to Cantonese. They looked Chinese. Sure there was some linguistic influence from elsewhere, but the same is true for the Cantonese. The point being that it wasn't about actually not being Han. Well it surely was for some people, but at least the foundational issues were not about ethnicity or religion or anything like that. They were about wealth.\n\nIt's at this same time we see the spread of things like secret societies and native-place associations or kinship associations. The situation in 19th century South China was so bad, all sorts of social systems came about to help mitigate the problems people faced. This also provided a good source of volunteers for things like the Taiping Civil War. It's basically impossible to talk about one thing happening in South China at the time without at least mentioning all the rest, given how interrelated it all is.\n\nAnyway, I hope this has answered your question. Feel free to ask follow ups, if you have them.\n\n**tl;dr:** The idea of Han-ness developed gradually over time. So did the notion of Hakkaness. There were some local conflicts in the 1800s and early 1900s that put these identities into conflict with one another, but mostly, outside of these regional contexts, it was never really a major question; the Hakka were already Han, to the extent that anyone was.\n\n**References:** (in English)\n\n* Campell, George (1912). \u201cOrigin and migration of the Hakkas\u201d.

First, it's important to understand that \"Han\" has always had a large number of various sub-ethnicities, though for most the distinctiveness has faded in recent decades. Previously, you would have Cantonese and Wu as comparable sub-groups. Hakka is such a subgroup, but in many ways still a distinct ethnicity within that. They differ from other Han groups in language, culture, dress, food and history \u2014 as do many others such as the Cantonese \u2014 but have two things going for the preservation of their identity. First, by working to preserve it, and second, by being so consistently marginalised in Chinese history. Had similar things happened around the Yangzte Delta, we might instead be asking about when the Wu came to be acknowledged as Han.\n\nThe question of the Han-ness of the Hakka people is a big one, and one that's caused no small amount of conflict, especially in the Late Qing. At that time, the efforts were to get people to learn about their native places as an effort to get them to see their place in the Great Qing and therefore feel more patriotic as a nation. This policy was known as \"from near to far\" (\u7531\u8fd1\u800c\u9060). It didn't work out well for the Qing court in the end. The idea, to teach history starting in the home with \"native-place histories\" (\u9109\u571f\u6559\u79d1\u66f8 and \u9109\u571f\u5fd7) and then spreading outward to the whole of the Empire, may have been well-intentioned and *was* ultimately good for getting local history down, but it turned into an opportunity for regional identity politics to become much bigger, as they were now being written about in the local histories being used for educating people.\n\nIn places like Guangdong, there were non-Hakka prople writing about Hakka as unwelcome outsiders who weren't Han. Instead the Hakka were grouped with various other not-so-well-liked groups (like the *She* \u7572 and *Dan* \u8711/\u6c34\u4e0a\u4eba and also Muslims), coming in, taking jobs, taking land, and diluting the language and culture. They were specifically designated along with the Hoklo and Dan as \"those coming from outside\" in some of these texts. This caused no amount of conflict between the Hakka and non-Hakka, and many Hakka writers/historians/etc began publishing their own accounts, saying that the Hakka were Han, and yes they came from the North but were still Han. \n\nThe Hakka and Cantonese were at odds throughout the 19th century, and these native place texts were really just the tail end of a half century of conflict, at times breaking out into wars.\n\nLater, in the 1930s, a scholar by the name of Lo, Hsiang-lin (\u7f85\u9999\u6797) wrote on the origins of the Hakka (\u5ba2\u5bb6\u6e90\u6d41\u8003), and while he wasn't the first, he is the most well known. By this time things had settled considerably, and in the 20th century the question of the Hakka being Han was, at least politically, a settled issue. There have been some DNA studies recently confirming this, because it's still a touchy enough subject that people feel the need to prove it with genetic testing. \n\nSo one might ask why the Hakka have been considered *not* Han by some peoeple. In the 1800s there was a series of conflicts known as the Hakka-Punti Clan Wars. Punti here is \u672c\u5730\u4eba, meaning local people, meaning Cantonese. This started in large part due to a complicated system of land ownership. One person was the owner of the land, and another was the owner of the surface soil. The land owner would have to pay the government taxes. The soil owner could keep their crops but then had to pay a tax to the land owner. In just about every case (actually every single case I've ever read about), it was the locals (Punti) who owned the land, since they'd come earlier, and the Hakka and another group known as the Pengmin would buy (if they could afford to) soil rights. The reason this was possible was because most of the land ownership was distributed generations earlier, and the owners rarely lived or farmed on what they owned. The Hakka/Pengmin/etc meanwhile needed land to farm, so the land owners were usually happy to sell off soil rights in order to make a quick buck.\n\nAdd to this that the 1800s were a horrible time for South China. You had famines (1810, 1811, 1846, 1849), piracy on the coast, and the first Opium War (1839-1842). The Punti-Hakka Clan Wars (1855 to 1867) \u2014 which were fought even on the Malay Peninsula, that's how strong the animosity was \u2014 were basically the result of the land ownership system creating great wealth for the Hakka at the cost of the Cantonese who saw the Hakka as outsiders. It was with *this* as the background that the issue of native-place schooling. Prior to this there wouldn't be much reason to consider the Hakka as not being Han. They came from the Central Plains. They spoke a Sinitic langauge very closely related to Cantonese. They looked Chinese. Sure there was some linguistic influence from elsewhere, but the same is true for the Cantonese. The point being that it wasn't about actually not being Han. Well it surely was for some people, but at least the foundational issues were not about ethnicity or religion or anything like that. They were about wealth.\n\nIt's at this same time we see the spread of things like secret societies and native-place associations or kinship associations. The situation in 19th century South China was so bad, all sorts of social systems came about to help mitigate the problems people faced. This also provided a good source of volunteers for things like the Taiping Civil War. It's basically impossible to talk about one thing happening in South China at the time without at least mentioning all the rest, given how interrelated it all is.\n\nAnyway, I hope this has answered your question. Feel free to ask follow ups, if you have them.\n\n**tl;dr:** The idea of Han-ness developed gradually over time. So did the notion of Hakkaness. There were some local conflicts in the 1800s and early 1900s that put these identities into conflict with one another, but mostly, outside of these regional contexts, it was never really a major question; the Hakka were already Han, to the extent that anyone was.\n\n**References:** (in English)\n\n* Campell, George (1912). \u201cOrigin and migration of the Hakkas\u201d.

Kalhu, known to readers of the Bible as Calah, is now called Nimrud; it was recently in the news when it was retaken from IS by Iraqi forces. Nineveh, by modern Mosul, was the capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\nXenophon's description of Kalhu is pretty spot on in terms of its size and the location of the ziggurat he mentions. However, his description of Nineveh isn't quite right. The circuit of the walls wasn't really as long as six parasangs (which in his account is more like 23km, or about 15 miles); it was actually only half that long. Also, the walls were probably nowhere near as tall as 100ft. They were, however, 50ft thick. His overstatement of their length might be the result of lack of time to explore the site. The [plan](http://www.history-book.net/maps/niniveh_01.jpg) of Nineveh is an irregular rectangle; if Xenophon marched along the east or west (long) side of the city, and assumed its plan was roughly square, he would have ended up with a hypothetical circuit wall double its actual length.\n\nIn the final years of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, both cities were besieged and captured by allied armies of Babylonians and Medes - Kalhu in 614 BC, and Nineveh two years later, in 612 BC. Both cities appear to have been violently sacked. The evidence from Nineveh is particularly gruesome: at one of the gates on the southwestern side of the city, skeletons of soldiers were found lying where they fell, mingled with the corpses of small children. Elsewhere in the town excavators found evidence of bodies that had been thrown into wells. The Assyrians retreated north and were briefly able to hold on to a remnant of their state after the sack of the capital, but their dominion was soon extinguished altogether. According to the traditions we have, the Medes took over control of the area, only to lose it again half a century later to the Persians.\n\nWhen Assyria fell, their entire bureaucracy and administrative culture completely disappeared from the extant record. They left no similar system in their wake. Their imperial structures and monuments had become useless, their artistic expressions of religious and imperial power meaningless. It seems likely that, without the presence of a large body of civil servants and soldiers running the largest empire in the known world, there was little in these cities to require or sustain a large population. And without a large population, how could a city the size of Nineveh be defended? Even if it wasn't quite as large as Xenophon claimed, 8 miles of wall and 15 gates is a lot of ground to cover.\n\nThe point is that these cities weren't valuable to the Assyrians for some independent reason. They were valuable to them because they formed the hub of their empire; with their empire gone, the cities lost their value. By consequence, when Nineveh and Kalhu were violently destroyed, no one made the effort to build them up again. Such reconstruction wouldn't have been just a one-time expense; the mud brick that was the typical construction material of ancient Mesopotamia naturally decays over time and requires constant maintenance. To keep the city and its defences intact would have required a vast investment. Apparently none of the powers that filled the vacuum after the fall of Assyria were willing to make that investment. We have no evidence for any major Median settlements; the Persians, once they took control, simply built their own brand-new capitals elsewhere.\n\nThe complete collapse of the Assyrian heartland is borne out by the fact that Xenophon recorded the wrong names for both of the cities he encountered. The origin of the names he gives them (Larisa and Mespila) is a mystery; the best modern historians can do is look for parallels between these names and words in Aramaic or other languages that may have been spoken in the region at the time Xenophon and the Ten Thousand passed by (in 401 BC). Either because he didn't speak to local inhabitants, or because the local population itself did not remember, Xenophon never discovered that the cities he passed were once the heart of a mighty empire, known to Archaic Greek poets as a wealthy power and employer of mercenaries. It's only in the Roman geographer Strabo that we find the name \"Ninos\" given to a city in old Assyria, showing that the site's dramatic history somehow survived.\n\nEven so, it should be said that Assyria did remain populated, insofar as it could sustain self-reliant communities of farmers. Xenophon's image of emptiness and desolation is exaggerated. There is some archaeological evidence for continued habitation in small parts of the former metropoleis of Assyria all the way down to the Parthian period, and some cities in the area were linked up to the Persian network of royal roads, showing they had at least some significance as waystations or local administrative centres. Indeed, in his description of Kalhu, Xenophon himself notes that some local people fled to the top of a crumbling ziggurat at the edge of the city when they saw the Greeks approaching, and a few days beyond Nineveh the Greek army encountered rural villages that contained \"an abundance of grain\" (*Anabasis* 3.4.18). Clearly, old Assyria was not entirely abandoned."], [100, "After the Romans left England and the urban economy collapsed, Roman Londinium remained abandoned for several hundred years.  Lundenwic, the Anglo-Saxon trading site was located on its outskirts, west of the old city and definitely outside the walls.\n\nAmong the reasons for why they didn't occupy this \"perfectly defensible\" site is that supposedly, the Anglo-Saxons didn't want to live in a place surrounded by walls and ruins, as it reminded them of a tomb (although I believe this reference is actually from Ammianus in the 4th century referring to European Saxons).  Certainly settlements were fortified with wooden palisade walls, but that was sufficient for them.  Keep in mind too, the clearance of stone ruins for inhabitance, is also a massive undertaking, as is evidenced by some of Theodoric's edicts telling the people of Rome in the 6th century they needed to clear the rubble for public safety.  \n\nThe site of Londinium was not re-occupied until the Viking attacks, when they had a definitive need for much sturdier fortifications, but how desperate must they have been to essentially move into a \"graveyard?\"\n\nTo take a modern analogy, would you rather build your own new house, or refurbish a falling apart one? (Rhetorical question)\n\nLong story short, I suspect the Anglo-Saxons, like the Persians, didn't see a need to reoccupy a site if it involved more work to inhabit it than it did to build another, newer place, especially if there's no symbolic need (especially if there's a symbolic detriment) for an older site.\n\n"]], [[{"comment": "The two ruined strongholds described by Xenophon (*Anabasis* 3.4.7-12), which he called Larisa and Mespila, have been identified beyond a doubt as the Assyrian cities of Kalhu and Nineveh.

The [plan](http://www.history-book.net/maps/niniveh_01.jpg) of Nineveh is an irregular rectangle; if Xenophon marched along the east or west (long) side of the city, and assumed its plan was roughly square, he would have ended up with a hypothetical circuit wall double its actual length.\n\nIn the final years of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, both cities were besieged and captured by allied armies of Babylonians and Medes - Kalhu in 614 BC, and Nineveh two years later, in 612 BC. Both cities appear to have been violently sacked. The evidence from Nineveh is particularly gruesome: at one of the gates on the southwestern side of the city, skeletons of soldiers were found lying where they fell, mingled with the corpses of small children. Elsewhere in the town excavators found evidence of bodies that had been thrown into wells. The Assyrians retreated north and were briefly able to hold on to a remnant of their state after the sack of the capital, but their dominion was soon extinguished altogether. According to the traditions we have, the Medes took over control of the area, only to lose it again half a century later to the Persians.\n\nWhen Assyria fell, their entire bureaucracy and administrative culture completely disappeared from the extant record. They left no similar system in their wake. Their imperial structures and monuments had become useless, their artistic expressions of religious and imperial power meaningless. It seems likely that, without the presence of a large body of civil servants and soldiers running the largest empire in the known world, there was little in these cities to require or sustain a large population. And without a large population, how could a city the size of Nineveh be defended? Even if it wasn't quite as large as Xenophon claimed, 8 miles of wall and 15 gates is a lot of ground to cover.\n\nThe point is that these cities weren't valuable to the Assyrians for some independent reason. They were valuable to them because they formed the hub of their empire; with their empire gone, the cities lost their value. By consequence, when Nineveh and Kalhu were violently destroyed, no one made the effort to build them up again. Such reconstruction wouldn't have been just a one-time expense; the mud brick that was the typical construction material of ancient Mesopotamia naturally decays over time and requires constant maintenance. To keep the city and its defences intact would have required a vast investment. Apparently none of the powers that filled the vacuum after the fall of Assyria were willing to make that investment. We have no evidence for any major Median settlements; the Persians, once they took control, simply built their own brand-new capitals elsewhere.\n\nThe complete collapse of the Assyrian heartland is borne out by the fact that Xenophon recorded the wrong names for both of the cities he encountered. The origin of the names he gives them (Larisa and Mespila) is a mystery; the best modern historians can do is look for parallels between these names and words in Aramaic or other languages that may have been spoken in the region at the time Xenophon and the Ten Thousand passed by (in 401 BC). Either because he didn't speak to local inhabitants, or because the local population itself did not remember, Xenophon never discovered that the cities he passed were once the heart of a mighty empire, known to Archaic Greek poets as a wealthy power and employer of mercenaries. It's only in the Roman geographer Strabo that we find the name \"Ninos\" given to a city in old Assyria, showing that the site's dramatic history somehow survived.\n\nEven so, it should be said that Assyria did remain populated, insofar as it could sustain self-reliant communities of farmers. Xenophon's image of emptiness and desolation is exaggerated. There is some archaeological evidence for continued habitation in small parts of the former metropoleis of Assyria all the way down to the Parthian period, and some cities in the area were linked up to the Persian network of royal roads, showing they had at least some significance as waystations or local administrative centres. Indeed, in his description of Kalhu, Xenophon himself notes that some local people fled to the top of a crumbling ziggurat at the edge of the city when they saw the Greeks approaching, and a few days beyond Nineveh the Greek army encountered rural villages that contained \"an abundance of grain\" (*Anabasis* 3.4.18).

Part of the problem is that scholars have not been able to reach an agreement about what he preached, especially before the papal censure in 1377. To give an example:\n\nSusan Brigden, a well renowned historian of London and the Reformation wrote \"Wyclif himself had believed in the Real Presence in the Eucharist, many of his later followers, ignoring or misunderstanding his subtleties, rejected the central mystery.\" (*New Worlds, Lost Worlds*, p. 87)\n\nRichard Rex writes that Wyclif denied \"the doctrine of transubstantiation...the body of Christ made really present under the outward appearance of bread whenever a priest consecrated bread with Christ's words.\" (*The Lollards*, p. 42)\n\nAnne Hudson, perhaps the leading authority on Lollardy, gives the middle of the road interpretation that Wyclif denied that \"that Christ is not in the sacrament of the altar\" but that \"Christ was really present in the consecrated elements.\" (*ODNB* John Wyclif, by Anne Hudson & Anthony Kenny). Hudson is correct to emphasize the subtle nature of Wyclif's view and explanation. Dropping the Aristotelian language and trying to smooth out the inconsistencies among his writings, Wyclif argued that the bread was still bread, but imbued with the spiritual being of Christ. Put another way, the bread was not visually just bread, it was actually bread, but it also was Christ. As Christ was both God and Man, so the bread was both Bread and Christ (Hudson, *Premature Reformation*, pp. 281-283). \n\nWyclif certainly did not make the arguments of later Lollards or the protestant reformers, denying Christ's presence in any form at the Eucharist. (A good example being the heresy proceedings in Kent in 1511-1512. One William Rich confessed that he had \"believed, thought, said, held, affirmed, and taught that...the sacrament at the alter is not the very body of Christ, but *only* material bread.\" Tanner, *Kent Heresy Proceedings, 1511-1512*, p. 28).\n\nSo, from the above information we have a good idea of what Wyclif probably believed and preached about the Eucharist between 1378 and 1382. Remember, when Wyclif was cited by the Pope in 1377, the main contentions were about Wyclif\u2019s arguments against papal authority and the ability of temporal lords to seize clerical wealth \u2013 these were not issues important to the common Londoner. However, claims made against the Eucharist were important to the common person because one of the centers of medieval life was Corpus Christi (both feast and mass). Wyclif\u2019s views on the Eucharist were initially for debate and discussion among the learned \u2013 not for common people. It was expected, and in all probability occurred that common people misunderstood Wyclif\u2019s message about the Eurcharist (Hudson, *Pre-Mature Reformation*). \n\nOn the subject of Chronicles, one of the main arguments that the people of London sympathized with Wyclif during the Peasant\u2019s Revolt, and in response attached the property of John of Gaunt. I gave a more substantial explanation of why the Londoners attacked John of Gaunt\u2019s property & references to the Chronicles [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5bw57u/why_did_the_londoners_in_the_great_rising_of_1381/). The shorter explanation is that the Londoners probably went after Gaunt because of his influence over the king in making unpopular decisions, not because he was part of the trial of Wyclif years before.\n\nEDIT: Forgot two of my sources on the significance of the Mass & Corpus Christi in medieval England - Rubin, *Corpus Christi: The Eucharist in Late Medieval Culture*, introduction; Bossy, \"The Mass as a Social Institution\" *Past & Present*, 1983, pp. 29-61)."]], [[{"comment": "It's difficult to tell what exactly the common Londoner would have thought of Wycliffe.
