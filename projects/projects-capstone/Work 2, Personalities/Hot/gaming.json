Also, his line \"Are you really going to go through with this?\" was strange and I couldn't put my finger on why it seemed a little bit off, almost ambiguous. One last thing though, is that I don't really imagine Ellie ever getting that emotional unless something very, very bad had happened. While it is possible that she formed similarly strong bonds with people after the events of TLOU Part 1, the only really strong relationship we know she has at this point is with Joel.

Old World Blues is still one of my favorite additions to Fallout.\n\nThen Skyrim comes around and you get a mediocre vampire story but with some alright factions and extensions to the vanilla game's vampirism. A return to Solstheim which was great but most of it centers around the whole Dragonborn thing which for me was something I actively tried to avoid after the first playthrough.

(Haven't cleared the game yet but I'm in Chapter 6 ATM)\n\n* Combat's rough and certain aspects of it needs some serious fine tuning but it works and can be fun as long as you're not fighting against anything that flies and spams status ailments every two seconds. (On the bright side, you could change accessories mid-battle)\n\n* Prompto's dumb as bricks. He uses a pistol, has some of the most miserable health and defense pool in the entire party and yet, he rushes into the face of death like those units you're supposed to rescue in SRPGs / TRPGs. Granted, he has the most powerful Link attacks in the party but blimey, he's also the first to perish in every difficult boss battle.\n\n* Quite a number of Link attacks have a tendency to miss and since it's real-time, the monsters moves around a lot. It can get mildly annoying when you're stuck with foes with a higher health pool since Link attacks are a reliable way to stack up some heavy damage.\n\n* Every summon is relevant in this game... on the flipside, they're all just equally OP so the only difference is visual in nature. (Then again, I only have access to some of them at this point of the story.)\n\n* Magic is fairly powerful but it's a consumable in XV and it's usage is narrowed down to a few spells and they're all offensive in nature. Stat buffing is now limited to food and item consumption. To be honest, you could easily clear most battles without using magic but it does make life easier.\n\n* Items allows you to cheese every battle in this game. As long as you're careful about it's use, you should have enough for every difficult optional encounter. It doesn't help when the party gains I-frames when using an item either - it's OP as hell. (Granted, items allows you to take on much higher level foes even on older FF games but not without a certain level of foresight. In XV, it only requires you to spam the crap out of it.)\n\n* Music's kinda meh for a FF game. Despite my angst against the XIII trilogy, it had decent music. XV's a little empty in that department.\n\n* Story's pretty disappointing so far and it's mildly humorous how Square attempts to appeal to nostalgia when XV had none of the charm that Sakaguchi's FF had. Making it open-world with a (weak) story revolving around crystals, royalty, four heroes, Cids and Highwinds doesn't automatically make it a FF game.\n\n* Characters are pretty much archetypes of anime pretty boys that are written to appeal to young women and honestly, the stale character development has offered no surprises thus far. Then again, I'm only in Chapter 6.\n\n* Quests and quick-travel were poorly designed. There is no way to take on multiple bounties at once (Which is annoying since you have to run back and fro repeatedly to complete them), missions that requires you to look for items in an area are a pain in the arse, 1/4 of gameplay time involves you watching a car driving through the countryside (It doesn't help when the characters are silent during the car trip) or the loading screen and quick-travel is only possible by car so a certain amount of manual movement is still required for the player to reach certain objectives even if they had visited the area before. (I had to take a trek up to a certain forest four to five times because of that.)\n\n* The fishing mini-game's pretty good and I really like the photography aspect of the game. It's pretty interesting to see how the characters' hobbies are integrated as actual gameplay mechanics.\n\n* Cities and locations are generally less diverse as opposed to older open-world FF games. They're not Bethesda's level of generic but they're not too memorable either. On the other hand, there *are* some pretty cool sights like the Meteor and it's actually possible to move from one location to the other without loading.... unless if you choose to quick travel.\n\n* Minimal glitches for an open-world game of it's scale. I only came across two game breaking bugs so far.

However, if a game is the third in a series and continues the story arc, I don't think it should be judged for accessibility to new players. People don't start off reading the third book in a series, or the final movie in a trilogy. I only saw the last Harry Potter film, and never read any of the books,  by your logic then, the film is quite bad because I had no idea what was happening or connecion to any of the characters. If a game is continuing a story arc, ot shouldn't have to pad itself to accomodate new players. Take Mass Effect, a person decides to play the third game and skip the first two, it's such a story heavy series that they'll be lost for large portions of it and not understand references to previous events or have connections to any of the charcters. Does that mean that the developers did a bad job?  No, they made the game because it's expected people have played the last two. They can play it sll they want, but a developer shouldn't have to go out of their way to make a game accessible. I think that your idea works in some instances, such as Mass Effect: Andromeda, where its a whole new story all together, but a game should not be judged on it's merits according to new players who have no experince with the game and decided to play the latest title", "id": "daqnhq3"}, {"comment": "Games are not books and movies, and share very little with those mediums. Any game can put a quick synopsis of the previous story into the opening without negatively affecting the rest of the game in any way.

I agree that gameplay should be judged in a vaccuum, but the accessibility of the story to newcomers to a game series needs to be on par.

It all depends on the dev, but a good guesstimate for running two cards in SLI is about +~80% performance.\n\nSLI used to work for up to 4 cards, and still does on older models, but the company who made it has restricted it to 2 cards for this release cycle, which makes sense. Few people ever use more than one card alone, nevermind running 4 high-end cards, and the performance benefits beyond 2 cards just is not worth it. Often it just makes games unplayable.\n\nConsoles cannot 'SLI' as the technology is exclusive to a specific brand of Graphics Card, with the main rival brand using the name Cross-Fire, or xfire. SLI is used interchangeably because marketing and it's shorter.\n\nSo, you ask, how can I link two consoles together to increase performance by ~80%? \n\nYou can't.\n\nLet's get this out of the way: in terms of raw processing power, consoles are FAR weaker than any PC you can build for above $300-$400+ (depending on where you buy, shipping etc). That is a fact.\n\nWhy don't consoles act as if they are so weak?\n\nO p t i m i s a t i o n .\n\nBecause there are currently like 3 variety of 'next gen' (hate that phrase) consoles (PS4, pro, Xbone) developers can put far more resources into making their game as smooth as possible for that given platform.\n\nAs for PC, well, we have a whole variety pf unique of systems. In order to make games playable on PC, instead of building games to specific hardware, developers on PC build to an API. Now, strictly speaking, consoles use an API as well, but it's a more 'snug' API, as it has like one job: MAKE XBONE PRODUCE GAME.\n\nSo PC api's have to cater to a wide variety of CPUs and GPUs in order to function on every system. This is why crappy console ports do not function at all well on PCs. They end up wasting the potential the PC had in it's beefed up hardware.\n\nSo, adding a 'console SLI' would more-or-less just make a developers life harder without providing tangible performance benefits.\n\nThe PS4 pro basically just adds another CPU which it uses in 'SLI' for the \"pro\" games, but again, despite the solid idea of \"it's a PS4 with EXTRA parts\", iirc there was a benchmark where the pro managed to perform worse than a normal PS4 in a non-pro game.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSLI is a PC term for using multiple GPUs.\n\nAdding SLI to consoles would split the playerbase (further) and make the devs life harder for little performance gain.\n\nHope I helped!", "id": "daqewc4"}, {"comment": "Just one note: I doubt optimization's a big factor in the current gen (if at all), esp. ever since AZDO OpenGL / Vulkan / DirectX 12 are a thing.\n\nFor this gen, it's probably more just using the right graphics settings (think changing ingame settings so that you have a 30FPS at 720p).\n\nA lower OS overhead in consoles doesn't exactly hurt either (e.g. Linux is typically faster that Windows on the same hardware [AMD being the exception, due to drivers &mdash; but shitty drivers are a non-issue in a Sony console], and FreeBSD &mdash; that the PS4 uses &mdash; has been tested to often perform even better than Linux for games).\n\nAll of this is a bit of a simplification still, but the point remains &mdash; I don't think optimization's that big of a factor, not anymore.

There is very often a way to avoid the same thing happening next time. Pay attention to the techniques that are getting you the further, and puzzle out how to improve. You can rarely trust your team as you're rarely playing with people you know, but you can still work with them (Spam the \"group up!\" button and wait at spawn to collect the team for a group attack) \n\nIf your team is really a problem, play a self healing character like Roadhog/Mei/Soldier/Lucio. Roadhog has a big health pool, Mei can set up walls and isolate/immobilize people 1 at a time, Soldier is really powerful at the moment, and Lucio is one of my favourites. If you get overwhelmed as Lucio you can boop people away and wall ride until  you're back up to health. Meanwhile if anybody's around you, they get a buff and your team manages to stay on the point much longer.\n\nPick you shots carefully. Spent an hour on the stupid training course. It's boring AF but it's important to get a feel for shooting with each weapon on the move without the chaos of a battle around you.\n\nPay attention to your team's balance, and fill whatever role is missing. Don't just ignore it because you're \"Better as DPS\" if your team doesn't have a tank, be a tank. A meh tank and a meh dps is still more effective in combat than a 2 great dps. Same goes with healers. The healer-tank combo is incredibly powerful.\n\n[This](https://www.furiouspaul.com/overwatch/) is like secret sauce if you want to step up your game and be aware of powerful techniques, character synergies, and who your character is best suited to face off against.\n\nA losing team is one that doesn't adapt its strategy to counter the enemy's. If you notice one particular hero of the enemies is just mowing down you team, figure out which hero you can switch to to most effectively single them out and beat them (this varies from hero to hero.) And give your team the chance they need to push back against the enemies they *can* defeat.

If they miss these opportunities because they are thinking about those shiny medals on the end of game screen, they're actually working hard to become objectively worse players within the framework of a team sport.\n\nI'm actually very disappointed in Blizzard for the way they implemented such a system. They created a game that hinges 95% upon a selfless commitment to team victory, and then implemented a reward mechanism that highly focuses players on abandoning team goals whenever an opportunity arises for self-aggrandizement.\n\nThey created a very competent and very compelling Skinner box that actively leads players to get worse at winning.

All of which can be either bought straight out or achieved with relatively low grind.\n\nAlso, 80 hours for a single prime piece is a gross exaggeration. While it is true that with RNG that is possible, before I worked for Digital Extremes (Warframe devs) I grinded out more than a few *complete* prime items (i.e.: multiple prime blueprints) with probably a total of 10-15 hours gameplay.\n\nEdit: sure, I'm biased because I've always been and always will be a fan, and having worked for Digital Extremes, but I assure you, the above is the truth.", "id": "daqenzt"}, {"comment": "You need to get off your high horse.

(The last time I checked, the only thing you can't earn by playing are certain, very few, prime \"accessories\", that include things like \"sugatras\", which are small bobbles that hang from your melee weapon.\n\nAnd even more special than the rare, or even unique TRULY free to play business model, are the devs, who believe me, are absolutely AMAZING at their jobs, and if it were even possible, even more amazing as people. They're so nice, so constantly concerned about what the players want, and expect and hope for, I'm not exaggerating when I say that working for them was not only one of the highlights of my life because it was like \"oh my God I'm working here?! holy shi*!\", but also because I've never met so many good, wholesome, honest people who were at the same time insanely talented and intelligent who were responsible for a game I love.\n\nI hope that helps clear up any negative impression regarding the explanation I gave.", "id": "dar2126"}, {"comment": "Well, assuming you already know about the whole swap from void keys to relics, which kind of alleviated some problems, as a long time player I got Valkyr prime the day she came out with about 4 hours of gameplay and no trading.", "id": "daqe20q"}, {"comment": "Nah. With a bit of persistence and effort, almost everything in the game can be attained without spending a single cent.\n\nThe only exceptions to this are Prime Access and Tennogen cosmetics. \n\nPrime Access gives you instant access to the brand new shinies, while also giving you some plat and cosmetics that are otherwise unobtainable (cosmetics in general do NOT affect stats or..anything really, except making you look pretty and win at Fashionframe - the true endgame). The Warframes and weapons are attainable in game the instant they're released though, so you can get them without spending real money.\n\nTennogen stuff is community created skins/cosmetics that are bought through Steam. Again, they don't affect anything except visually. They cost real money, but damn are there some good designs out there. ^\\(looking ^at ^you ^Nova ^Visage ^skin)\n\n**You can also trade in-game items to other players for the premium currency** (Platinum) to buy anything from the market or to buy other stuff off players. Not many games allow for this.\n\nFor example: Aside from supporting the game when it was released (basic Founder package), I had not spent a single cent until about 3-4 months ago when I bought the Nekros Prime accessories pack. I have made tens of thousands of plat in [the time that I've played](http://i.imgur.com/Nb5DIfT.jpg). More than 90% of which was from trading, not buying platinum.

But this year the competition is fierce: Dishonored 2, Gears of War 4, Battlefield 1, XCOM 2, Dark Souls 3, Uncharted 4, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Titanfall 2, Firewatch, Pokemon Sun&Moon, Fire Emblem: Fates, Darkest Dungeon, Forza Horizon 3, Watchdogs 2, Abzu, Stardew Valley, Oxenfree, Superhot, Civilization VI, That Dragon Cancer, Inside...

Not only are OW updates/patches frequent, they often drop *early*. That's fucking UNHEARD of. Some developers have announcements to annouce an announcement is coming about future updates (*cough* Bungie). With this team, they just come out when they're ready, often announced same day.  \n\nSeason 2 of competitive started 4 days early after they realized releasing it then would allow players to start during a long weekend - what other developer does this?\n\nIt's not even just a Blizzard thing, it's very specifically a Jeff Kaplan and his team thing. \n\nNo development team did more to earn that GOTY award this year, and if you're going to cite \"years of development\" working on story for something like UC4, the OW team had this in the stove for just as long if not longer prior to release - simply for different reasons."], [76, "But Titanfall 2's done the same PLUS they have 0 rng (loot boxes) PLUS they have an outstanding campaign...

I love the diversity in the game and love the art direction and it plays smooth when it isn't rubber-banding (on PC). But it doesn't really anything really new. Yes, it a new IP which is always a great thing, but that still doesn't make it any better. It is a good game, but my goodness, If I could on'y apply the word \"overhyped\" and \"overrated\" on one game, it would definitely be Overwatch without a doubt.

Any additional content that is core to the experience is FREE. all maps and operators are 100% free, with the only items requiring real money are some exclusive cosmetic items.\n\nalso, the developers have just announced a second year of content, which will still be free aside from some cosmetic items. oh and here's the best part, anything you want in game, you can either work for it, or buy outright. None of this stupid loot box crap where you either get lucky and get the item you want, or you wait until you get enough duplicates to buy what you want.\n\nAnd those 300+ cosmetic items, what does most of that consist of? sprays, voice lines, and some poses. they added a few skins with the summer and halloween events. not only were they put behind an RNG wall with their event loot boxes, but now if you want to get them you either have to wait until the even rolls around again, or you fork out the cash in HOPES that you get the skin you want.\n\nBlizzard made a highly polished game and i'm glad they're giving any additional content for free, but there ARE better games out there with developers doing the exact same thing that blizzard is doing (titanfall 2 will have no paid dlc, just cosmetic items as microtransactions, all multiplayer content for uncharted 4 is free, with the option to pay to get what you want immediately).\n\ni'm okay with overwatch winning GOTY. i play it and i have a lot of fun, but the maps and heroes don't have the same level of depth that games like rainbow six siege has, and it can get stale for me pretty quick.

Overwatch has multiplayer, yes, but it hardly feels like you've got an actual team if you're not partied up.  I hear the strategy is good in the higher echelons of ranked play, but \"best multiplayer\" should go to something where that's clear throughout the game.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but there are a lot better games out now imo. Doom should of got it for how well they did a reboot of a classic series. It's just spectacular. I've been playing doom since I was like 4 and it's like they captured the classical nature of it with upgraded technology. I can see your argument of it's new. But I personally feel like OW needs a lot more to be a game I'd play non stop. No side objectives, no character progression. It's like everything in a MOBA simplified down so anyone can play it and it takes no real learning. Like obviously there are little things to learn to do with each character but it feels like the ceiling is a lot lower coming in and at the top. Maybe I'm wrong though, as It just hasn't struck the right cord on me to hop on the OW 24/7 train. The constant fights with no momentum building or shifting just feels dull to me. Like why isn't there an Anubis boss or something in the map, the points get locked, and then you fight over the boss instead. It's way too linear.

There are a ton of points to make about Overwatch, but I think it still does not belong in a Game of the Year category, even in such a biased event as is The Game Awards.\n\nHad this game been released in 2014, for instance, which as a rather mediocre year for gaming with just a handful of games standing out from the pond, I wouldn't even blink -- Overwatch would be GoTY. But this year the competition is fierce: Dishonored 2, Gears of War 4, Battlefield 1, XCOM 2, Dark Souls 3, Uncharted 4, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, Titanfall 2, Firewatch, Pokemon Sun&Moon, Fire Emblem: Fates, Darkest Dungeon, Forza Horizon 3, Watchdogs 2, Abzu, Stardew Valley, Oxenfree, Superhot, Civilization VI, That Dragon Cancer, Inside...

This thread talks about why overwatch should've won but doesn't talk much about the game. He talks about support and development from blizzard. All the points made describe that blizzard is a good company and deserves recognition as well as to be a top selling game (which it is) but that recognition shouldn't be presented in the form of a GOTY award. Let's say I release a shit game but don't charge people for DLC and have a bunch of micro transactions as well as constantly push updates. It's still a shit game. The company should be recognized for doing what a company should do but that recognition should be GOTY. ", "id": "dar13ha"}, {"comment": "I think it beats out every one of those.  I don't disagree that the competition isn't fierce, nor do I disagree that calling the last 10 years of games all rehashes and cash grabs is a drastic overstatement.  Nor do I think it's fair to treat Blizzard as a benevolent god company - they have cashgrabs too.  Hearthstone is very cash grabby and Heroes certainly doesn't have one of the nicer methods of monetization of MOBAs.\n\nHowever, all of those things are aside of the main point.  Overwatch is absolutely still a better GOTY than all of those in my opinion.  It's not a blowout, it's definitely a competition and those games are all fine contenders to a greater or lesser degree.  \n\nOf all those games though, Overwatch sold more copies, has more people playing it, has more people watching it.  Which is not the sole metric of quality, but is worth considering why.   I'd also argue it has the most polish, the best balance, the most responsive developer and the most free content.  I've never spent a penny on Overwatch outside the $40, but there are options for if I wanted to - options that are entirely cosmetic which is also very important.   Above and beyond all that, the game also manages to bring together widely divergent skill levels - from people who have never played FPS, to people that have played and hated other FPS including a friend of mine who has eyesight so poor that he normally can't play them all the way to FPS veterans at the highest competitive level.  All in the same game.  That is an incredible accomplishment and is the real reason why Overwatch is so special.   Titanfall2 for example is a great FPS game that lots of FPS fans love.  How many non-FPS fans also play it?  Overwatch is a great FPS game that lots of FPS fans love AND many other non-FPS fans also love.  That is something special too.  Similar things go for the other games on the list.  How many non-Pokemon fans played Sun&Moon?  How many non-RPG fans loved Fire Emblem?  How many non Dark Souls fans did Dark Souls 3 pick up?\n\nNow these are all arguments you could dispute.  If another game was actually my favorite game, I would quite probably feel like it did things better than Overwatch.  However, I think Overwatch is objectively very much worthy of Game of the Year.

They are the reason servers are occupied for years and not months - and the reason why developers have an incentive to keep working on the game. The moment you start ignoring what the hardcore players want, you are signing the death warrant for your game.\n\n\nThis doesn't matter with stuff like COD/BF with another release around the corner, but it is crucial for a game like TF2 that is much more about building a community. I feel like Valve is making a similar mistake with CS:GO - ignoring long standing complaints from players in lieu of creating the next case.

Any additional content that is core to the experience is FREE. all maps and operators are 100% free, with the only items requiring real money are some exclusive cosmetic items.\n\nalso, the developers have just announced a second year of content, which will still be free aside from some cosmetic items. oh and here's the best part, anything you want in game, you can either work for it, or buy outright.
