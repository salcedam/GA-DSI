Money is more valuable if you have to work for it) might teach them the value of money if you use allowance in lieu of just buying them things when they ask for it. They want a new game or toy, or they want to go to the movies with friends? They have to use their allowance for it. (if you want to go a little more hardcore, then for a teenager you can give them a big \"allowance\", but they have to use that to buy certain necessities like clothes and shampoo and school supplies) This teaches them that money is finite, and they have to save if they want something more expensive that what their weekly allowance is. They'll also learn to be more careful about what they buy, since they won't want to spend their hard-earned, well-saved cash on something crappy or something they won't use much. Use this to teach them to think about their purchases in terms of time and work, not just a dollar amount. The toy doesn't cost $30, it costs two weeks worth of allowance, that's two weeks worth of chores. Is it worth that amount of work? Will you play with the toy enough to make it worth it?\n\nThe reason I recommend giving kids allowance is because it's a lot easier to save for the long term when you have consistency. When I was younger, I spent my birthday and Christmas money immediately because having money was so rare for me. I knew it would be another 6 months before I got that kind of money again, so I figured I better spend it on the items I want now, since saving up for anything more expensive (like a laptop or new game system) would have taken years anyway, and what kid has the patience for that? You know how a lot of poor people who end up with a little extra money (say, a tax return) end up blowing through it? Sure, some people are poor because they have bad money habits, but sometimes poverty CAUSES bad money habits. For many people, it creates the mentality of \"I have all of this money right now, and if I don't spend it now, it's just going to drain away on other purchases. I might as well get something nice while I have the chance\".\n\nYou could also try offering them \"interest\" if they choose to save money.

The literature others have linked matches up with what I've read. Biggest savings for the Nest comes from improving the schedule over what you would usually set on a typical programmable thermostat. If you could get an optimal schedule that matches precisely with how you use your home and it has the same temperature swing settings, then a programmable thermostat is probably identical. The extra savings for the Nest come from including your location info and an occupancy sensor to know when you're home, and for extra fan runtime when the ac system is running.\n\nI personally found that being able to remotely log in to my thermostat when I'm headed home after being out late and turn up the heat from its 55F \"away\" setting so things are nice and toasty before i get home has been a huge and unexpected bonus.\n\nSomething that others haven't mentioned is that some utility companies have special demand response programs you can sign up for with a wifi thermostat. They give you an incentive when you sign up, and they'll remotely change the setpoint so your ac doesn't run as much on really hot days while you are away from home. Also many more utility companies offer big rebates for this kind of unit- it was $100 back when i lived in MA.\n\nEdited to add: it's also possible to much more finely tune your schedule, particularly if it's complicated. My old 5+1+1 programmable thermostat didn't care whether it was Monday (get home at 5) or Thursday (get home at 7), and you could put in a maximum of four temperatures per day.

If my car died tomorrow, I would have spent about 250 a month on it total. That includes purchase price, insurance, and gas (not including the recent cross country move I made with it).

Hydrogen peroxide remains the bleaching agent that does the whitening.\n\nThe difference between home and professional teeth whitening is just the concentration. Home whitening products typically contain 3.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 10% carbamide peroxide which yields 3.5% hydrogen peroxide. Professional whitening can use 25-40% hydrogen peroxide. That's why home-use products require many uses to achieve the same whitening as one professional session, but they're safer and less likely to cause sensitivity at the same time.\n\nSo swish some hydrogen peroxide.

If you have a detached garage with a covered walkway to the house go in the garage and look up there is almost always an opening there, check where your power lines enter the home and have all tree branches trimmed off of the home, if it is brick be sure to make sure that your weep holes aren't overly large if they are going to your local hardware store or home depot/lowes and buy a roll of plaster mesh it looks like chicken wire but it has little squares you will need a pair of gloves and wire snips you can also do it to any opening on the home, it is very flexible. You can also you rat traps or glue boards the one thing that I will stress is on the rat traps don't immediately set it if you can get up in the attic and see the rats trails in the insulation set it there but don't engage it wait at least 3 days then set it the reason for this is that rats are curious and afraid so if you let them get used to it they will start crossing over it then you can set it and boom, the glue boards work good to especially at a garage door opening one on each side of the door.

I make the bread myself (not by hand, using a bread machine on a timer function so it's freshly baked when I wake up), and use whatever jam I get from the discount grocery. \n\n- Another cheap breakfast: Instant miso soup with a few pieces of seaweed in them, piping hot rice with an egg cracked on top of it and stirred up. Add some soy sauce and sriracha and done. \n\n- Lunch I really like toasty sandwiches. Whatever leftovers I have (chicken, pork, beef, anything really) shredded up and mixed with something green like spinach, cheese, and toasted up warm. \n\n- Leftover tacos or enchiladas is another lunch. Whatever meat or veggie-based meat-ish dish I made previously, I chop it up in the food processor really quick, fill tortillas with it, and dump some enchilada sauce on top and sprinkle some cheese on top and bake it covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for the last 10. \n\n- My basic dinner is stir-fry veggies, orange/sauceofsomesort chicken, and rice. A bit of rice wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and sugar makes the rice way more flavorful, and the rice cooker does the work for me. For the chicken I just use boneless chicken thighs, cut them up, lightly dust them in a fried chicken powder I get from the grocery store here, and cook them in a pan. Meanwhile, a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies defrosted in the microwave and set to dry on paper towels to soak up all the excess moisture. Toss the veggies in with the chicken. You can either buy a packet of pre-made sauce, but it's easy to take an orange and use the juice + zest and some of the peels themselves, soy sauce, a bit of hoisin and hot sauce, some sugar and salt and pepper, and add in a bit of arrowroot powder or cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up, and then toss it all in the sauce. You can make a similar sauce with lemons as well for lemon chicken. \n\n- Some sort of hearty soup like potato, broccoli and cheese soup will do the trick as well. A bit of butter, leeks, onions, garlic, carrots, cauliflower, and potatoes all boiled soft. Then puree it, add some steamed broccoli and any kind of cheese on top.

I make the bread myself (not by hand, using a bread machine on a timer function so it's freshly baked when I wake up), and use whatever jam I get from the discount grocery. \n\n- Another cheap breakfast: Instant miso soup with a few pieces of seaweed in them, piping hot rice with an egg cracked on top of it and stirred up. Add some soy sauce and sriracha and done. \n\n- Lunch I really like toasty sandwiches. Whatever leftovers I have (chicken, pork, beef, anything really) shredded up and mixed with something green like spinach, cheese, and toasted up warm. \n\n- Leftover tacos or enchiladas is another lunch. Whatever meat or veggie-based meat-ish dish I made previously, I chop it up in the food processor really quick, fill tortillas with it, and dump some enchilada sauce on top and sprinkle some cheese on top and bake it covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for the last 10. \n\n- My basic dinner is stir-fry veggies, orange/sauceofsomesort chicken, and rice. A bit of rice wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and sugar makes the rice way more flavorful, and the rice cooker does the work for me. For the chicken I just use boneless chicken thighs, cut them up, lightly dust them in a fried chicken powder I get from the grocery store here, and cook them in a pan. Meanwhile, a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies defrosted in the microwave and set to dry on paper towels to soak up all the excess moisture. Toss the veggies in with the chicken. You can either buy a packet of pre-made sauce, but it's easy to take an orange and use the juice + zest and some of the peels themselves, soy sauce, a bit of hoisin and hot sauce, some sugar and salt and pepper, and add in a bit of arrowroot powder or cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up, and then toss it all in the sauce. You can make a similar sauce with lemons as well for lemon chicken. \n\n- Some sort of hearty soup like potato, broccoli and cheese soup will do the trick as well. A bit of butter, leeks, onions, garlic, carrots, cauliflower, and potatoes all boiled soft. Then puree it, add some steamed broccoli and any kind of cheese on top.

What they can't sell, they'll donate for you (or you can pay for return shipping). \n- Say goodbyes, spend time, and share things by letting friends look through what I didn't need/wanted to give to them.\n- If there's a bag you want to bring, it should be filled with stuff.

Here is what I'm doing; you can get a hitch and small trailer for your car for a few hundred bucks.  Even small cars can typically tow a little bit, but check your owners manual or online to be sure.  [This](http://www.harborfreight.com/870-lb-capacity-40-in-x-49-in-utility-trailer-62646.html) 4 ft trailer is $180.  If you need more room than that you could get [this](http://www.harborfreight.com/1195-lb-capacity-48-in-x-96-in-heavy-duty-folding-trailer-62648.html) 8 ft one for $300.  Figure on $120 or so for a hitch for your car.  Grand total is $300-$420.  You can also get a roof rack for $80 or so for even more room.  Compare this to renting a car - I figure 3 day rental (2 days might be doable but tough if you include packing/unpacking) $150, +$100 for gas and maybe $50 for tolls (just guessing here).  That puts you at about $300 for the rental car.  Keep in mind you can't take turns driving so it will be a lot more work for both of you, plus you're going to have to rush to pack and unpack so you aren't paying extra for the rental, plus limited room for big stuff.  On top of that you spend all that money and you have nothing to show for it in the future.  If you buy a trailer and hitch you can keep it and use it in the future for hauling around other stuff.\n\nYou'll have much more room for furniture than a car would give you.  I assume you haven't started packing yet, once you do you'll realize how very limited your space is in a car.  Most furniture will not fit, at all.  If it does fit it will take up all the room and you can forget about anything else.  You can't fit a bed or mattress, etc.  Even a large tv won't fit in a car.  With a trailer you can actually take all that stuff with you which will save you money in the long run.  On top of that you'll now own the trailer for use in the future to get more stuff.  Let's say you did just go out there with two cars, how are you going to buy a bed?, what about a couch and stuff?  You're going to be paying hundreds of dollars to get that stuff delivered.

If you've questioned getting rid of something before, do it now.\n- If you're looking for extra cash upon arrival, checkout companies like thredup. They'll send you a bag to send items for sale. What they can't sell, they'll donate for you (or you can pay for return shipping). \n- Say goodbyes, spend time, and share things by letting friends look through what I didn't need/wanted to give to them.\n- If there's a bag you want to bring, it should be filled with stuff.

It adds up\n \nThis is because retailers have to pay fees to the credit card companies.  If you use a rewards credit card the difference is pretty minimal, maybe a few pennies per gallon, and not all stations do this anyway.  My advice is to use the Gasbuddy app.  You'll save a lot more money going to the cheaper gas stations than you will messing around with cash.  Usually the places along the highway are expensive, you can save significant money just going out of your way 5 minutes if you know where to go.  Also, keep your speed around 65 or so.  Speeding really eats up the gas on long trips.  Finally set your mapping app to avoid tolls and see how much time it adds to your trip.  Sometimes it only adds a few minutes but can save you $10-20 in tolls.\n \nAlso, food.  Bring a cooler with lots of snacks and drinks.  This will save you a bunch of money over the fast food places.", "id": "dajab37"}, {"comment": "Good stuff right here", "id": "daisuwl"}], [{"comment": "have you priced a one way car rental?

There is a subreddit for this, I will look which one. Things like beans and lentils are way cheaper than meat, so you might consider making a lot of vegetarian meals if you're not already doing that.

Just make sure to buy all your ingredients at Aldi, Liddl, Dirk van der Broek etc. Often you can buy a 5kg bag of potatoes which will last you a long time. \nI don't know how the rules of the voedselbank are, but you can try to see if they can help you.

Buy your meat in bulk (chicken and eggs are usually the cheapest ones) and use it as an accent to a meal vs the star of the show. For example.. chicken salad sandwiches can be less chicken and far more veggies with a few shreds of it in there. Cooked, shredded chicken freezes into individual servings quite well, and eggs are VERY versatile. Things like sloppy joes (I don't know if you eat those there? But they're basically a tomato sauce based messy sandwich on a bun) are typically all ground meat, but I've noticed no real flavor difference making an all vegetable version with chopped onion, celery, and mushroom. Black bean burgers, zucchini noodle spaghettis, they all have a lot of healthy bulk for your buck. \n\n- Get to know the staple cheap meals in your area. For us, it's spaghetti and soup.. you can always find stupid cheap ingredients for these meals. Whatever cheap down-on-your-luck meals are in your region, you can always rely on them. \n\n- Pick recipes with similar ingredient lists. A soup, a stir fry, and a baked oven dish can have very similar ingredients.. in contrast, picking recipes that have very different ingredients can really make the grocery bill go up. There are tricks to playing with everything.. have lentils? You can make a lentil based soup, lentil and bean salad side dishes, and you can even make gravy out of them so you don't have to buy a bunch of extra ingredients to make different things.  \n\n- Pick in season produce and sales. Often grocery stores will sell their 'ugly' food cheap.. an ugly carrot peeled is still a carrot. \n\n- Start some frugal habits.. instead of buying chicken stock and veggie stock, use the trimmings from the meals you prep (bones, the ends of celery and onion skins, etc.) and boil your own stock to use in dishes. Realize you can eat potato skins just the same as peeling them. Get comfortable with beans of all sorts and rice. Home-make your breads and biscuits and items that are actually very very cheap but come in convenience packages for more money. Typically frozen veggie medleys are very cheap as well, so if you want a recipe with more exotic produce like baby corn, red bell pepper, edamame, etc.. consider a frozen blend vs fresh. Buy your staples in bulk.. flour, butter, rice, beans.. they can all be purchased in bigger amounts and used throughout the month. \n\n- Pick recipes you actually like. People can suggest beans are cheap all day long, if your kid hate beans it does no good. Pick staples you like, and be okay with eating the leftovers of them.. because leftovers seriously save you time and money. I never really cook lunch anymore.. I usually just eat the double portion I cooked from dinner.. so breakfast and dinner are the only meals I 'cook'.. though even then I only cook once a week and meal prep everything, so really it's just double meals (lunch and dinner) + breakfast meals prepped. \n\n- Cooking for two can be just as expensive sometimes as cooking for 4 people. I think meal prep has really saved me money.. I cannot recommend it enough. Taking recipes built for 4 servings and turning them into two days worth of meals, pre-counted (to ensure I'm getting enough calories) and pre-made ready to heat and eat has turned my grocery bill into near nothing. I live in the states, but I only spend $200 a month on food American. \n\n- Be okay with pouncing on free food opportunities to eat new things. Tired of rice and beans? Or your leftover chicken that week? Is your work having a meeting where they serve any food? Or a house potluck party you can attend to eat some outstanding food? A friend having you over for dinner? .. Take those opportunities to really enjoy things you might not be able to afford right now. \n\n- Take very cheap items to potlucks and parties. Party food can really blow a budget.. but everyone knows I am the bread lady because bread is stupid cheap and everyone loves fresh made bread, so I always write on here that that's what I bring. For less than $1 I feed a crowd and they like the recipes I make. Pick some very very cheap staples and bring those. "], [9, "Hoi. \n\nStudent mother in the Netherlands here.

I think meal prep has really saved me money.. I cannot recommend it enough. Taking recipes built for 4 servings and turning them into two days worth of meals, pre-counted (to ensure I'm getting enough calories) and pre-made ready to heat and eat has turned my grocery bill into near nothing. I live in the states, but I only spend $200 a month on food American. \n\n- Be okay with pouncing on free food opportunities to eat new things. Tired of rice and beans? Or your leftover chicken that week? Is your work having a meeting where they serve any food? Or a house potluck party you can attend to eat some outstanding food? A friend having you over for dinner? .. Take those opportunities to really enjoy things you might not be able to afford right now. \n\n- Take very cheap items to potlucks and parties. Party food can really blow a budget.. but everyone knows I am the bread lady because bread is stupid cheap and everyone loves fresh made bread, so I always write on here that that's what I bring. For less than $1 I feed a crowd and they like the recipes I make. Pick some very very cheap staples and bring those. ", "id": "dal35zw"}, {"comment": "This is a great post.

Costco is a terrific bargain. Here's what I noticed\n\n* Costco has terrific values on some products. The specific products may shift from state to state (depending on competition) but typically I've found consistent benefits on gas (at least 20 cents cheaper per gallon), cheese, meat, alcohol, organic food. On these products alone, you can save your membership and more. Costco is often cheaper than hole-in-wall ethnic markets. I've also seen fantastic deals on clothing -- I got a soft shell jacket for $20 and the exact same jacket was selling at eddie bauer for $100. Food prepared on site like cakes, rotisserie chicken, etc are also much cheaper than local grocery stores\n* Costco is higher quality and if you buy stuff like EV olive oil and honey you can be sure you are getting an unadultered product. This is not true at many other stores like Walmart etc.\n* Costco doesn't have 20 different versions of a product so it saves you time from having to compare against all the options. No need for coupon clipping either or searching the flyers for the best deals\n* Costco margins are set by design low enough so that they make all their profit from the membership fees. This means if you see a new product, you can bet you are getting a fair price on it.\n* Costco has an excellent return policy. You can even return opened food if you don't like it\n* Sometimes a local grocery will have a special on produce that beats costco's price. But you have to spend time to monitor these local deals. Costco's deals are consistent which makes it easier to plan and saves time.\n* If you're not careful you can end up buying a lot of prepared food. While costco will have a good price on it, prepared food is always more costly than making from scratch.\n* Costco's are almost always located in suburbia. So you need to drive. \n* As DINKs we find that if you buy something like the broccoli or salad at costco, you have to eat it almost everyday or it will go bad before you use it all up. That's okay for us and we just rotate on a weekly basis (i.e. this week we get the bag of broccoli, next week we get the salad).\n\nThe only grocery store that I've seen which can beat costco is Grocery Outlet (gets overstock and stuff that's about to expire). But grocery outlet has no consistency in products it gets and still doesn't beat costco on items like cheese. GO also have very little in the way of fresh food.\n\nOur strategy now is to go to costco once a week (we have to drive) and just walk to grocery outlet / ethnic markets for everything else. Trader Joes is good as well but we don't live within walking distance to one anymore."], [1, "It's really not. My parents got a membership when we were kids thinking the same thing.

All half off our local grocery stores. There's also the rotisserie chicken, pumpkin pies and a few other things we buy very irregularly. We don't buy the cafeteria food anymore either.\n\nWe almost never buy household products there, prefer Walmart online or Target if needed quicker, and never any of the more expensive items, we don't even go down those aisles. I don't even buy gas there because of the lines, distance from our home, and I get Safeway gas rewards. \n\nIt comes down to a simple calculation, whether you think you can save $55 a year or $4.58 per month, weighing the parking and crowds of visiting on the weekend once a month or during holiday season, and whether the free food samples are worth anything."], [2, "I think it also depends on where you live.

The specific products may shift from state to state (depending on competition) but typically I've found consistent benefits on gas (at least 20 cents cheaper per gallon), cheese, meat, alcohol, organic food. On these products alone, you can save your membership and more. Costco is often cheaper than hole-in-wall ethnic markets. I've also seen fantastic deals on clothing -- I got a soft shell jacket for $20 and the exact same jacket was selling at eddie bauer for $100. Food prepared on site like cakes, rotisserie chicken, etc are also much cheaper than local grocery stores\n* Costco is higher quality and if you buy stuff like EV olive oil and honey you can be sure you are getting an unadultered product. This is not true at many other stores like Walmart etc.\n* Costco doesn't have 20 different versions of a product so it saves you time from having to compare against all the options. No need for coupon clipping either or searching the flyers for the best deals\n* Costco margins are set by design low enough so that they make all their profit from the membership fees. This means if you see a new product, you can bet you are getting a fair price on it.\n* Costco has an excellent return policy. You can even return opened food if you don't like it\n* Sometimes a local grocery will have a special on produce that beats costco's price. But you have to spend time to monitor these local deals. Costco's deals are consistent which makes it easier to plan and saves time.\n* If you're not careful you can end up buying a lot of prepared food. While costco will have a good price on it, prepared food is always more costly than making from scratch.\n* Costco's are almost always located in suburbia. So you need to drive. \n* As DINKs we find that if you buy something like the broccoli or salad at costco, you have to eat it almost everyday or it will go bad before you use it all up. That's okay for us and we just rotate on a weekly basis (i.e. this week we get the bag of broccoli, next week we get the salad).\n\nThe only grocery store that I've seen which can beat costco is Grocery Outlet (gets overstock and stuff that's about to expire). But grocery outlet has no consistency in products it gets and still doesn't beat costco on items like cheese. GO also have very little in the way of fresh food.\n\nOur strategy now is to go to costco once a week (we have to drive) and just walk to grocery outlet / ethnic markets for everything else. Trader Joes is good as well but we don't live within walking distance to one anymore.", "id": "darbd83"}], [{"comment": "It's really not.

Usually costs about $5. I love it but most people aren't excited when you roll up with the mixed bean salad. "], [2, "Things I typically bring: \n\n- Fresh baked bread. It costs me less than $1 to make, feeds a bunch, and I don't even make it myself I use the bread maker.. if I want it to look more hand made and won't be slicing it myself first I just use the dough setting and bake it myself. This is more often than not what I bring to almost anything.. mooost food events get fresh bread. It's just stupid cheap to make. I sort of made it a 'thing' to bring this, which has worked out well for me.. people knowing that's usually what I'll show up with makes the whole thing easier for me. \n\n- Cheese and cracker dish. Can't really go wrong with snacks, and crackers are fairly inexpensive and feed a crowd.. I just buy big blocks of whatever cheap cheese and chop them myself. Stick a bit of mustard in the middle and it's done in no time. \n\n- Up there with that is a fruit/veggie platter. A tub of yogurt serves as a quick no-work dip for the fruits, and veggies can get some sour cream + some spices mixed in.. and sometimes stores have very inexpensive pre-made dips too, or you can just go with a salad dressing in a container. Get whatever is cheap and in season, chop it up, and voila. Done. \n\n- A drink. Sometimes a nice homemade drink goes a long way, so whether it's alcoholic or not a homemade drink can really hit the spot. I'm pretty well known for making large pitchers of mocktails (non-alcoholic cocktails). You can usually get some fruit, club soda, and other fancy ingredients for about $5 total. \n\n- Pigs in a blanket... they have a ton of variations of these too, so even if you've got vegetarian friends the price doesn't increase that much for this dish. Can of crescent rolls + some hot dogs or veggie dogs, and you're already almost done. \n\n- A dip.

It costs me less than $1 to make, feeds a bunch, and I don't even make it myself I use the bread maker.. if I want it to look more hand made and won't be slicing it myself first I just use the dough setting and bake it myself. This is more often than not what I bring to almost anything.. mooost food events get fresh bread. It's just stupid cheap to make. I sort of made it a 'thing' to bring this, which has worked out well for me.. people knowing that's usually what I'll show up with makes the whole thing easier for me. \n\n- Cheese and cracker dish. Can't really go wrong with snacks, and crackers are fairly inexpensive and feed a crowd.. I just buy big blocks of whatever cheap cheese and chop them myself. Stick a bit of mustard in the middle and it's done in no time. \n\n- Up there with that is a fruit/veggie platter. A tub of yogurt serves as a quick no-work dip for the fruits, and veggies can get some sour cream + some spices mixed in.. and sometimes stores have very inexpensive pre-made dips too, or you can just go with a salad dressing in a container. Get whatever is cheap and in season, chop it up, and voila. Done. \n\n- A drink. Sometimes a nice homemade drink goes a long way, so whether it's alcoholic or not a homemade drink can really hit the spot. I'm pretty well known for making large pitchers of mocktails (non-alcoholic cocktails). You can usually get some fruit, club soda, and other fancy ingredients for about $5 total. \n\n- Pigs in a blanket... they have a ton of variations of these too, so even if you've got vegetarian friends the price doesn't increase that much for this dish. Can of crescent rolls + some hot dogs or veggie dogs, and you're already almost done. \n\n- A dip.

It's worth it. \n\n* If you have a \"specialized\" prescription, like progressive, you will pay extra.

Items you use go on sale on a fairly regular schedule.  So, keep an eye out on the price for a particular item every week, and when it reaches 40%+ off regular price, consider that a \"good sale.\"  So, as an example:  cereal is usually about $4 a box around here.  So, when I see a sale for 4/$10 (or 2 for $4, or similar), I know that's a \"good sale.\"  Use the Walmart app to figure out if something is a good price if you don't know it offhand already.\n\n2.  Use a coupon to buy that item when it is on sale.  Tons of couponing sites actually match up the coupons and sales for you, so all you have to do is either print the coupon or find the relevant insert and cut out the coupon.  A file cabinet/accordion file is useful for paper coupons.\n\n3.  Buy enough of the product when it's on sale (or on sale + coupon) to last you/your family until the next time the item goes on sale again.\n\n\nIt can get more complicated when you get into stacking different kinds of coupons/discounts, but the premise is still the same:  buy what you use when it goes on sale, and buy enough of it to last you until it goes on sale again.

So, keep an eye out on the price for a particular item every week, and when it reaches 40%+ off regular price, consider that a \"good sale.\"  So, as an example:  cereal is usually about $4 a box around here.  So, when I see a sale for 4/$10 (or 2 for $4, or similar), I know that's a \"good sale.\"  Use the Walmart app to figure out if something is a good price if you don't know it offhand already.\n\n2.  Use a coupon to buy that item when it is on sale.  Tons of couponing sites actually match up the coupons and sales for you, so all you have to do is either print the coupon or find the relevant insert and cut out the coupon.  A file cabinet/accordion file is useful for paper coupons.\n\n3.  Buy enough of the product when it's on sale (or on sale + coupon) to last you/your family until the next time the item goes on sale again.\n\n\nIt can get more complicated when you get into stacking different kinds of coupons/discounts, but the premise is still the same:  buy what you use when it goes on sale, and buy enough of it to last you until it goes on sale again.

I would say walmart is a good place to find some cheap pots and pans they have a home essentials line of stainless steel pots that are cheap. \n\nAlso don't buy anything thats not on sale and it should be a good sale.. \n\nIf you hit dollar general for a real small item like a box of cookies on tuseday they will give you a $5 off $25 coupon for friday or  sat and then you go buy your soap and tuna and whatever .. they have that almost every week you just have to buy one small thing during the week and its on your receipt.\n\nAlso if you can and you have a cash back credit card put everything you can on it Right now I have $100 on my cash back since about a year ago it will cover my christmas presents and something for me.. i don't have kids though so .. but I put everything I can on that card .. gas.. food.. even $5 at dollartree goes on the card but I pay it off the same day I get the bill in the mail.. You can put your utilities on your card and maybe your rent but call your card and ask if they give you cash back.. 1% on your rent and utilities will add up pretty good if you can.", "id": "dahact9"}], [{"comment": "Vaulted ceilings and ceiling to floor windows look awesome but you will waste so much money on heating and cooling.

If 99% of people only want your good for 5 years, you choose your design, materials and components to last for that length of time (to some statistical level of certainty).

My daughter, who was completely healthy her first year of life, was diagnosed with epilepsy this past year. We have fantastic health insurance and met our deductible within the first month of her illness so we're only paying 20 percent of her medical bills, and we're still out thousands this year. In fact, I have about $400 in ER bills on my table from November. (an ER visit when her fever hit 105 and she had a seizure even while medicated. Plus she's having another brain MRI in two weeks and the copay on that sucker is like $350) Additionally, infants go to the doctor monthly for shots and checkups, toddlers and children visit the doctor often for checkups, and kids STAY sick. Plus they are little patient zeroes that get you sick every time they have an -itis. In the last two months I've missed 6 days of work because of illnesses between my daughter and myself. My daughter now sees a team of specialists at a great hospital for her epilepsy...and each doctor on the team charges a separate bill. At this point I can't afford to even look at a doctor for myself,lol.\n\nFor diapers, 1-2K  for a child that can wear \"normal/cheap\" diapers is a good estimate. We cloth diapered (About $600) ours while I stayed home because her skin was so sensitive (chemical burns from disposable) but now that  she's in care I have to buy disposables- at about $50 a week or $2600 a year. Her sensitive butt also has to have sensitive wipes, so that's another $500-700 bucks.\n\n We adopted so I couldn't breastfeed (didn't have enough time to try hormone therapy) and our formula was about $36/week or $1800 that first year.\n Clothing is a joke, man. They outgrow EVERYTHING so fast! There were things that she only wore once or not at all, and when she hit a growth spurt at 13 months I literally bought her a new pair of shoes every two weeks. I don't even want to think about clothing and shoes expenses but I have spent at least $2500 a year because those tiny things are not cheap. \n\nToys and books are other big expenses for us, simply because my kid is very big on books and figures out toys so quickly. She's smart, and I'm constantly trying to keep her stimulated to encourage that. I bet we spend about 1K-2K a year or more on toys/books, and that's buying a lot of them second hand. \n\nWe also do activities now that she's two. We have memberships to the zoo, museums, local play centers, and she takes dance and gymnastics. She's begging to play basketball next year when she's 3 and old enough, so that will be another $40 a month plus expenses.\n\nI'd estimate that with all the expenses listed above plus our $12k a year in childcare, we probably spend around $22-$25k a year on one child. You don't have to do all of these things, but it's easy to spend $$$ when you have a kid because you want to give them every opportunity that you feasibly can. For us, it's even more so because our daughter was adopted after several pregnancy/infant losses; sometimes I feel that I spoil her extra for the ones that I lost, you know? Pregnancy/easy child birth isn't an option for a lot of people, so that is something that you also have to factor in when trying to prepare for having kids. We had no clue that we would have fertility problems so we didn't factor that in when we started saving for a baby and trying to conceive. It seems so easy, but child bearing doesn't always just happen naturally. Fertility treatments, medical interventions, pregnancy losses (Especially in states where they are considered abortions and not completely covered by insurances) and adoption (avg. private baby adoptions are $25k-$75k, even foster care adoptions are not completely free) all add up. When we started the journey we had $30k saved up, and that ran out before we even got to the adoption process! We had to put our daughter on credit card,lol. They're worth every single penny and then some, but kids can really drain your wallet. I'm sure that I missed expenses in my lists above- I didn't even go into baby gear (and mine had to be approved by DHS and the adoption agency as well!) or college funding.

Roughly $800 per month until she was old enough for preschool. Then $400 per month for preschool. Public school is far cheaper, but still it's $1500 for after school, and approx. $200ish per week while school is out.

"], [1, "My two kids go to a cheap daycare. It still costs more than our rent."], [1, "I have five young kids at home, one that has left home, and one on the way. Here's my take:\n\nClothes don't have to be expensive at all. _If_ you are lucky enough to have relatives with kids, you might be able to get tons of hand-me-downs. We are in that position; in fact we have a relative who runs clothing resale shops. She combs through the incoming stuff and once in a while brings us a trash bag of barely-used clothes. A lot of it we don't like, so we just pass that stuff on, but there's enough left to clothe everyone. In fact we just got rid of an outfit that has been handed down five times and the fabric was pretty much disintegrating (sadly). We got good use out of that outfit!\n\nFood can be a pain; my wife and I cook very frugally (bone broth, lots of things from scratch, buying in bulk, etc.) but a couple of the kids are very picky eaters. It's easy to say \"well, either the kid eats what is served or the kid doesn't eat\" but some kids (especially with autism or related sensory issues) may actually starve themselves and you might need to buy or make separate meals that child is willing to eat if you don't want the child to be actually malnourished.\n\nSomething that list doesn't include is wear and tear on your home. Very spirited kids who are super-active or love to figure out how things are put together will break every goddamn thing in your home. One of my kids tears off wallpaper, draws on every surface possible, crams things into heating vents, opens child-proof bottles, deliberately flooded the bathroom, knocked the blades off the ceiling fans... it's just... amazing. Little darling has done literally thousands and thousands of dollars worth of damage to our home. They don't teach you that in parent school. Others in the family -- never did anything like that. Siblings can be _extremely_ different.\n\nEntertainment expenses don't have to be that big but bored kids will make your life miserable. We try to teach them early on to use art supplies (we use a LOT of art supplies) and make things when they don't have chores or school work.\n\nThe biggest thing is that kids bring chaos, and chaos can be expensive.\n\nI am not really looking forward to the years when 3-4 of them are teenagers at once. We are actually working on a \"teenager food fund\" to cushion the shock of those years. We expect to have two full-sized freezers with a pig and a cow in them, pantry room filled with canned food, and I hope by then we will be growing all our own greens 8 months out of the year.\n\nOh yes... there also aren't that many cheap cars that will hold a family of 7-8 with multiple child car seats of different types.\n\nAnd... child car seats of different types.

We both brushed our teeth the same way and ate roughly the same food, so you can't blame him for not taking care of them properly.

My daughter, who was completely healthy her first year of life, was diagnosed with epilepsy this past year. We have fantastic health insurance and met our deductible within the first month of her illness so we're only paying 20 percent of her medical bills, and we're still out thousands this year. In fact, I have about $400 in ER bills on my table from November. (an ER visit when her fever hit 105 and she had a seizure even while medicated. Plus she's having another brain MRI in two weeks and the copay on that sucker is like $350) Additionally, infants go to the doctor monthly for shots and checkups, toddlers and children visit the doctor often for checkups, and kids STAY sick. Plus they are little patient zeroes that get you sick every time they have an -itis. In the last two months I've missed 6 days of work because of illnesses between my daughter and myself. My daughter now sees a team of specialists at a great hospital for her epilepsy...and each doctor on the team charges a separate bill. At this point I can't afford to even look at a doctor for myself,lol.\n\nFor diapers, 1-2K  for a child that can wear \"normal/cheap\" diapers is a good estimate. We cloth diapered (About $600) ours while I stayed home because her skin was so sensitive (chemical burns from disposable) but now that  she's in care I have to buy disposables- at about $50 a week or $2600 a year. Her sensitive butt also has to have sensitive wipes, so that's another $500-700 bucks.\n\n We adopted so I couldn't breastfeed (didn't have enough time to try hormone therapy) and our formula was about $36/week or $1800 that first year.\n Clothing is a joke, man. They outgrow EVERYTHING so fast! There were things that she only wore once or not at all, and when she hit a growth spurt at 13 months I literally bought her a new pair of shoes every two weeks. I don't even want to think about clothing and shoes expenses but I have spent at least $2500 a year because those tiny things are not cheap. \n\nToys and books are other big expenses for us, simply because my kid is very big on books and figures out toys so quickly. She's smart, and I'm constantly trying to keep her stimulated to encourage that. I bet we spend about 1K-2K a year or more on toys/books, and that's buying a lot of them second hand. \n\nWe also do activities now that she's two. We have memberships to the zoo, museums, local play centers, and she takes dance and gymnastics. She's begging to play basketball next year when she's 3 and old enough, so that will be another $40 a month plus expenses.\n\nI'd estimate that with all the expenses listed above plus our $12k a year in childcare, we probably spend around $22-$25k a year on one child. You don't have to do all of these things, but it's easy to spend $$$ when you have a kid because you want to give them every opportunity that you feasibly can. For us, it's even more so because our daughter was adopted after several pregnancy/infant losses; sometimes I feel that I spoil her extra for the ones that I lost, you know? Pregnancy/easy child birth isn't an option for a lot of people, so that is something that you also have to factor in when trying to prepare for having kids. We had no clue that we would have fertility problems so we didn't factor that in when we started saving for a baby and trying to conceive. It seems so easy, but child bearing doesn't always just happen naturally. Fertility treatments, medical interventions, pregnancy losses (Especially in states where they are considered abortions and not completely covered by insurances) and adoption (avg. private baby adoptions are $25k-$75k, even foster care adoptions are not completely free) all add up. When we started the journey we had $30k saved up, and that ran out before we even got to the adoption process! We had to put our daughter on credit card,lol. They're worth every single penny and then some, but kids can really drain your wallet. I'm sure that I missed expenses in my lists above- I didn't even go into baby gear (and mine had to be approved by DHS and the adoption agency as well!) or college funding.

Here's my take:\n\nClothes don't have to be expensive at all. _If_ you are lucky enough to have relatives with kids, you might be able to get tons of hand-me-downs. We are in that position; in fact we have a relative who runs clothing resale shops. She combs through the incoming stuff and once in a while brings us a trash bag of barely-used clothes. A lot of it we don't like, so we just pass that stuff on, but there's enough left to clothe everyone. In fact we just got rid of an outfit that has been handed down five times and the fabric was pretty much disintegrating (sadly). We got good use out of that outfit!\n\nFood can be a pain; my wife and I cook very frugally (bone broth, lots of things from scratch, buying in bulk, etc.) but a couple of the kids are very picky eaters. It's easy to say \"well, either the kid eats what is served or the kid doesn't eat\" but some kids (especially with autism or related sensory issues) may actually starve themselves and you might need to buy or make separate meals that child is willing to eat if you don't want the child to be actually malnourished.\n\nSomething that list doesn't include is wear and tear on your home. Very spirited kids who are super-active or love to figure out how things are put together will break every goddamn thing in your home. One of my kids tears off wallpaper, draws on every surface possible, crams things into heating vents, opens child-proof bottles, deliberately flooded the bathroom, knocked the blades off the ceiling fans... it's just... amazing. Little darling has done literally thousands and thousands of dollars worth of damage to our home. They don't teach you that in parent school. Others in the family -- never did anything like that. Siblings can be _extremely_ different.\n\nEntertainment expenses don't have to be that big but bored kids will make your life miserable. We try to teach them early on to use art supplies (we use a LOT of art supplies) and make things when they don't have chores or school work.\n\nThe biggest thing is that kids bring chaos, and chaos can be expensive.\n\nI am not really looking forward to the years when 3-4 of them are teenagers at once. We are actually working on a \"teenager food fund\" to cushion the shock of those years. We expect to have two full-sized freezers with a pig and a cow in them, pantry room filled with canned food, and I hope by then we will be growing all our own greens 8 months out of the year.\n\nOh yes... there also aren't that many cheap cars that will hold a family of 7-8 with multiple child car seats of different types.\n\nAnd... child car seats of different types.

If you like it, feel free to adopt it.\n\nMy mother's extended family is very close and friendly. We put up with each other a lot and we can be ourselves around each other. They used to, of course, all have Thanksgiving together. But as people grew up, got married, got older, died of old age, had children and in-laws etc. that began to change. People who used to share Thanksgiving now each had a little Thanksgiving of their own.\n\nMy mother has a theme for Thanksgiving Week. Monday you shop. Tuesday you clean. Wednesday you bake. You couldn't possibly make everything eaten on Thanksgiving, *on* Thanksgiving. You make the pies on Wednesday. That fills the house with wonderful smells associated with wonderful things you can't eat because They Are For Tomorrow. Tomorrow, though, when you're done with the turkey, you have trouble wanting pie...\n\nMy mother had a solution to all of this.\n\nPie Day.\n\nOn Wednesday, the day before Thanksgiving, all that extended family who has elsewhere to be *on* Thanksgiving bring their pies, and she makes her pies, and we all eat pie all day. We also share slices around, so that you might go there with a pumpkin pie and leave with half a pumpkin pie and a third of Aunt Cindy's cherry pie.\n\nThen the pie part of Thanksgiving is, basically, leftovers from Pie Day. There's always enough. And everyone gets to see each other.\n\nPie Day at my mother's house is basically open all day long. People who work show up after work. People who work odd shifts show up when they're awake. Homemakers come whenever they please, and nearby homemakers may come back whenever other people show up.\n\nMy sister-in-law surprised my mother one year with a gift of a custom t-shirt with a lattice-crust pie depicted on it and the text \"Semper Pie\".\n\nPie Day is a family tradition that hasn't even lasted for one generation yet, and it is as important to us as if we had been doing it for hundreds of years.", "id": "daqt5yk"}, {"comment": "I liked your correction, popular misconceptions annoy me too!\n\nThat sounds really great, food related traditions are the best.

It comes from the Jewish concept of the \u201cintegral age\u201d of the great Jewish prophets. This is the notion that the prophets of Israel died on the same dates as their birth or conception.\n\nTherefore, if Jesus died on March 25, being a great prophet, he was also conceived that day. This means he was born nine months later on December 25th. The pseudo-(John) Chrysostomic work De Solstitia et Aequinoctia Conceptionis et Nativitatis Nostri Jesu Christi et Iohannis Baptistae accepts the same calculation. St. Augustine mentions it as well. Also, there was a Jewish concept that the Messiah would be conceived around the time of Jewish Passover, and a March conception is certainly within the range of Jewish Passover.\n\nhttp://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/3512/the_roots_of_catholicism_pagan_or_jewish.aspx\n\nAt this point, we have to introduce a belief that seems to have been widespread in Judaism at the time of Christ, but which, as it is nowhere taught in the Bible, has completely fallen from the awareness of Christians. The idea is that of the \u201cintegral age\u201d of the great Jewish prophets: the idea that the prophets of Israel died on the same dates as their birth or conception.\n\nThis notion is a key factor in understanding how some early Christians came to believe that December 25th is the date of Christ\u2019s birth. The early Christians applied this idea to Jesus, so that March 25th and April 6th were not only the supposed dates of Christ\u2019s death, but of his conception or birth as well. There is some fleeting evidence that at least some first century and second century Christians thought of March 25th or April 6th as the date of Christ\u2019s birth, but rather quickly the assignment of March 25th as the date of Christ\u2019s conception prevailed.\n\nIt is to this day commemorated almost universally among Christians as the Feast of the Annunciation, when the Archangel Gabriel brought the good tidings of a savior to the Virgin Mary, upon whose acquiescence the Eternal Word of God (\u201cLight of Light, True God of True God, begotten of the Father before all ages\u201d) forthwith became incarnate in her womb. What is the length of pregnancy? Nine months. Add nine months to March 25th and you get December 25th; add it to April 6th and you get January 6th. December 25th is Christmas, and January 6th is Epiphany.\n....................\nFurther look into the term shows that it's part of Kabballah, rather than being strictly in the Old Testament Scriptures and further Jewish scriptures.", "id": "daqqh1z"}, {"comment": "My parents told me to my face that the ring I picked out and my fiance paid for wasn't a real engagement ring because it has an amethyst instead of a diamond.

The tires were 9 years old but were not mentioned as a direct cause of the crash. SPEED was. Let me guess...you are a shop OWNER, correct?\n\nOn November 30, 2013, at approximately 3:30 p.m. PST, Walker and Roger Rodas, 38, left an event for Walker's charity Reach Out Worldwide for victims of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda)[52] in Rodas's red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT. The car crashed into a concrete lamppost and two trees on Hercules Street, in a 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) speed zone near Kelly Johnson Parkway in Valencia, Santa Clarita, California, after which the vehicle burst into flames. The crash was caught on film by a security camera.[52][53][54][55][56] Authorities determined that Rodas was driving the car while Walker was the passenger.[57] The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department declared both victims dead at the scene.[54][58] Rodas died of multiple traumatic injuries while Walker died from the combined effects of traumatic and thermal trauma, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. Both of their bodies were burned beyond recognition.[57]\n\nThe curve where Walker and Rodas were killed is a popular spot for drifting cars.[59] The coroner's report stated that the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was traveling at a speed possibly as high as 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) before the crash. The coroner's report further stated that no alcohol or other drugs were found in the systems of either man.[60] Furthermore, it states that there were no hints of technical problems with the car and neither a damaged surface of the street nor parts on the street played a role in the crash.[61] Police investigated as to whether drag racing played a role but were unable to find evidence of a second car's involvement.[62] A piece of the car was stolen off the tow truck as the wreckage was towed away on a flatbed. Two men, Jameson Brooks Witty and Anthony Janow,[63] were arrested for grand theft.[64] Walker's autopsy showed \"scant soot\" in his trachea, leading investigators to believe he died before the car was engulfed in fire, where Rodas was killed on or shortly after impact by head, neck, and chest trauma.[63][65]\nGrave of Paul Walker at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills\n\nIn March 2014, further investigation revealed that the speed of the car was the main reason for the crash. The car was said to be traveling between 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) and 93 miles per hour (150 km/h) and had nine-year-old tires that were seldom driven on.[65]\n\nWith Furious 7 in the middle of filming at the time of Walker's death, Universal announced an indeterminate hiatus on the production, citing a desire to speak with his family before determining what to do with the film.[66]\n\nNumerous friends and movie stars posted tributes to Walker on social media.[67] His body was cremated and his ashes were buried in a non-denominational ceremony at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.[68]\n\nIn December 2014, Walker's father, Paul III, filed a lawsuit against Rodas's estate seeking the return of, or \"a proportionate share\" of revenue generated by a group of automobiles that were jointly owned by both Walker and Rodas.[69]\n\nIn September 2015, Walker's daughter Meadow filed a suit against Porsche for wrongful death of her father, claiming that the Porsche Carrera GT had numerous design defects including a history of instability, and that seat belt placement can cause harm upon impact.[70][71][72] Porsche's response denied any wrongdoing and blamed Walker himself, stating: \"The perils, risk, and danger were open and obvious and known to him, and he chose to conduct himself in a manner so as to expose himself to such perils, dangers, and risks, thus assuming all the risks involved in using the vehicle.\"[73] In April 2016, a U.S. District Court ruled in favor of Porsche in a separate lawsuit filed by Roger Rodas' widow, Kristine.[74] The ruling has no bearing on two other cases against Porsche which have been filed by Walker\u2019s father, who is also the executor of the actor\u2019s estate, and his daughter.

Kay had been invalided by a stroke 10 years earlier, which had paralyzed the left side of her body. Kay was also a smoker who smoked in bed, and kept her cigarettes, lighter and ash trays on a tray positioned on her right side, along with the controls for her hospital bed and electric blanket. At about 7 a.m., Kay awoke to pain on her left side and saw flames leaping out of the left side of the bed near her leg and hip. Kay, who was in her 70s, recuperated in the hospital for five months, but lost part of her left arm, as a result of her burns.\n\nFire department investigators determined that fire originated on the left side of the hospital bed, and narrowed the source of ignition to the blanket or a cigarette, but concluded that a burning cigarette was most likely the source of the fire.\n\nIn late June, however, a civil jury concluded that the blanket played a role in the fire, and in awarding Kay $2 million in compensatory damages, assigned one third of the blame to Sunbeam. In the second phase of the trial, the jury heard evidence of Sunbeam\u2019s $1.9 billion net worth, to determine punitive damages. George McLaughlin, who represented the Kays with co-counsel James Crispin, asked for $1 each for the 30 million blankets Sunbeam had sold. But before the jury could decide, Sunbeam and the Kays reached a confidential settlement.\n\nKay\u2019s blanket was supposed to be protected from ignition by a safety circuit known as Circuit 104, designed by Sunbeam in 2000 to replace a 1983 circuit design that had brought tens of thousands of fire complaints since its introduction. The old-style electric blanket relied on what is known as a positive temperature co-efficient (PTC) heating element, which was protected by a safety circuit known as Circuit 100.\n\n\u201cCircuit 104 is much better, but we\u2019re still getting about 5-10 percent of the number of fire claims \u2013 150 to 180 legitimate fire claims a year. The sales volume and the number of smokers haven\u2019t changed,\u201d said McLaughlin, of McDermott, Hansen & McLaughlin, LLP, of Denver, Colorado. \u201cCircuit 104, however, isn\u2019t perfect and fires do continue to happen. This is the first Circuit 104 case to go to a jury verdict, and Sunbeam lost \u2013 even though they assigned my client two-thirds of the blame. The jury believed that the product was defective. That was pretty significant.\u201d\n\nThe history of Sunbeam, electric blanket and fires is a long and checkered one. Even as Sunbeam sought a patent for this technology, the company acknowledged that the PTC design was prone to fires:  \u201cSince the heating wire used in heating pads and electric blankets is typically made very thin and flexible and is subjected to repeated flexing from use, conductor breaks in the heating wire are common. When a conductor break occurs . . . [this] can cause a fire.\u201d\n\nInitially, Sunbeam relied on a triode-based sensing circuit, called Circuit 100, to reduce the fire risk. But, Circuit 100 proved to be inadequate to preventing electrical fires. It did not provide short circuit protection for all of the PTC wiring within the blanket, and it did not provide open circuit protection in some circumstances \u2013 the safety circuit itself sometimes caught fire. A former Sunbeam engineer, William Rowe Jr., who eventually (and briefly) became a plaintiff\u2019s witness against Sunbeam warned the company in a September 20, 1983 memo that the safety circuit was not reliable enough, and that the company could expect about 500 blanket fires a year.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the company was actually receiving 1,500-1,800 fire complaints annually about electric blankets bearing the Circuit 100. The complaints ranged from pin-hole sized burns, to full scale fires resulting in deaths, injuries, and property damage.\n\nIn 1995, the CPSC opened an investigation into Sunbeam electric blankets. \nAnd in November of that year, Rowe\u2019s testimony helped persuade a jury to return a verdict against Sunbeam in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\n\nOklahoma, and awarded punitive and compensatory damages in a case in which a PTC electric blanket fire caused a death. Sunbeam sued Rowe on the eve of his testimony, but eventually settled the case, paying Rowe to be a consultant, effectively barring him from being an expert witness for other plaintiffs. (Rowe continued to be subpoenaed as a factual witness in Sunbeam electric blanket cases until his death a few years ago.)\n\nIn 1997, the CPSC asked Sunbeam to stop the sale of blankets using its old PTC technology and pressured the company to develop a safer design, develop a corrective action plan or recall the old blankets. Sunbeam eventually launched a newly designed safety circuit called the \u201ccore-yarn\u201d safety circuit or the Model 602. Sunbeam sold about 60,000 Model 602 electric blankets, but recalled them by June 1998, after this circuit also failed to prevent electric blanket fires.\n\nJuries continued to find against Sunbeam. In January 1999, Sacramento Superior Court jury returned a $6.2 million verdict in a Sunbeam PTC heating element electric blanket fire case. By April of that year, Sunbeam electric blankets were the subject of an expose on ABC 20/20. Under pressure from its industry-supported standards and certifying agency, Underwriters Laboratory, Sunbeam finally replaced the Circuit 100 with a new, safer Circuit 104 in 2000.\n\nDespite the jury verdicts, the bad press and pressure from the CPSC, Sunbeam, which sells about 3 million electric blankets annually, has never recalled any with a Circuit 100. Nor has it taken any steps to recall or redesign Circuit 104 in a way to prevent it from failing.\n\nIn a news article about the verdict, a lawyer for Sunbeam said that the company stands behind its product.\n\nMcLaughlin says he doesn\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to change until a jury trial goes to punitive damages.\n\n\u201cThat might get people\u2019s attention,\u201d he said.", "id": "dai18o8"}, {"comment": "I mean...I feel like I should say thank you, but I also feel worse now.

I have some experience with hot tubs and in that world there are two types of tubs; 110 V and 220 V.  Many people assume that the higher powered hot tubs will give them a higher electric bill.  In fact the opposite is true, higher powered tubs can save you a lot of money because you only turn them on when you actually use them.  See the lower powered tubs can take several hours to heat up so once people finally get them warm they don't want to shut them off, hey maybe I want to jump in the tub later, I don't want to have wait around hours for it to warm up again right?\n \nSo, let's compare this to the heater scenario.  Maybe your radiative wall heater takes 2 hours to get your room warm.  You've been sitting shivering waiting for it to finally warm up and now it's time for you to go to the store.  If you figure it's going to take you 3 hours to go to the store are you going to shut your heater off or leave it running?  Most people will just leave it running.  Do you really want to come home and have to sit there for hours again waiting for it to warm up?  No way.  The result is that with the lower power heater you tend to leave it running much longer, even when you're not at home, because it's such a pain waiting for it to warm up your place.  A heater that is ten times more powerful though might heat your room up in 15 minutes.  Whenever you're not home you can shut it off.  Because you use it much less your power bill is lower.  \n \nSource: Design engineer and general tinkerer.", "id": "dai6pvf"}, {"comment": "The issue with both of these is that what you're paying more to hear is the walls, not the air.

It doesn't cost any more electricity to run a device on AC power for one hour versus spending 15 minutes to charge a battery that you then use to power the device for an hour. (Actually, the battery is slightly less efficient because you lose some energy in the transfer and so on, but you get my point.)\n\nSo, if the oil heater periodically shuts off, either you are paying for it by using more electricity per unit time when its on (keep in mind that not all electrical devices draw the same amount of power when on), or if the two heater types draw the same wattage, it MUST follow that you are simply getting less heat out of the oil-based one because it isn't on as long.\n\nThat's not to say there aren't other advantages to the oil-based heating (more even spatial distribution of heat or whatever), some of which (like the spatial distribution) could make you FEEL warmer depending on how the room is arranged, and thus you might choose to use it in a way that requires less electricity. But in terms of pure heat generated... to quote Homer Simpson, \"In this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics!\" Since efficiency is defined by how much energy is lost to heat (as opposed to being used to move a motor or light a room or whatever), any halfway-decent heater will have an efficiency of (almost) zero.

But unless your room is 100% perfectly insulated, different heaters will still cost different amounts to run. \n\nThe rate of heat loss of a room increases exponentially with the difference between inside and outside - if your room is warmer, then you're losing more energy per second than if it was cooler.\n\nSo for a given target temperature, the most efficient option is a heater that puts out exactly the wattage needed to maintain the room at this temperature. Every degree above this means you're losing heat faster.\n\nA bar heater at exactly this wattage would be perfect. But since it's unlikely to be the case, you need a thermostat to turn it on and off to keep the room in a given range. This means that the bar heater is going to be heating the room higher than desired, then shutting off until it drops below, and repeating the cycle.\n\nAn oil heater also has a thermostat, but the oil acts as a buffer to radiate heat at a fairly constant rate during this on/off cycle - getting us much closer to the 'exact wattage' perfect heater, spending less time wasting heat above the desired temperature.\n\ntl;dr Bar heater spends more effort to heat the room above the desired temperature, which causes more heat loss to outside.
