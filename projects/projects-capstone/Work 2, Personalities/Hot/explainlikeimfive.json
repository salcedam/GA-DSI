The whole concept of the modern Internet is that it's divided between your computer requesting information (the client) and some other computer providing that information (the server).  That client/server relationship became how the Internet started working in the 80s (or so, there's room for debate).\n\nThe buzzword that is \"the cloud\" just means that either the  computational work or simple storage is being done elsewhere (i.e. on a server) that you can access from anywhere.  There's a further implication that you can access it from a wide variety of clients and the server-end (\"cloud\") will do the work of delivering it properly.\n\n"], [10, "So all the answers so far miss some key parts to the story. Why should you take my word for it? I'm a senior engineer with 20 years commercial experience, several of them in ISPs and Telcos, and I've been working a lot with cloud technologies for the last 6-7 years or so.\n\nTo make sense of the difference, let's go back in time and figure out what changes people made.\n\nThe very first computers were large and cumbersome. They lived in the place where they were built, and were used by the people who built them. This was the case in the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s it became possible for a computer to be built somewhere else and delivered to you. A large computer would need a specialised room, known as a \"machine room\" (although it was sometimes called a \"data centre\" to make the horrific costs more relatable at board level). A company buying a new computer would find some space in one of their buildings, raise the floor (so that power, cooling and other systems could go underneath the computer components), and the computer would be installed.\n\nIn the 1970s computers became smaller and so these machine rooms would house not one big computer, but perhaps several smaller ones - albeit quite large by today's standards.\n\nBy the 1980s computers got to a size where you could fit one on your desk. However, you'd want it to be able to talk to your company's bigger computer, or perhaps a computer in another town. Clients and servers had been around for some time, but now they became much more popular. Even smaller \"big\" computers were now put in machine rooms that were rebranded \"server rooms\" or retain the title \"data centre\".\n\nIn the 1990s, the Internet started to take off. Even before the web, small independent ISPs were popping up, each of them with very different kinds of server requirements. By now it was possible to take a standard PC, put the internals into a rack mount case, install a server operating system on it (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.), and put it in your ISPs machine room/data centre for a fixed monthly or yearly cost. This is called \"co-location\": you buy hardware, you go and install it in a data centre, and if it breaks, you need to buy replacement parts and go in and physically service it yourself.\n\nOne of my first jobs was looking after one of these sites, we'd have hundreds and hundreds of machines brought in by clients every year, and we'd rack them up, and plug them in - they'd have access to high-speed (for the time) Internet and power, and be in a climate-controlled room with good fire suppression. These rooms were not nice places to work quite often.\n\nAfter a while, somebody realised that people would want a server to host a website on, or run their own email server, but they didn't want to buy the equipment, or perhaps wanted to try it for a few months to see how well it worked before making an investment. That led to a lot of innovation.\n\nFirst, there were dedicated servers. These are machines you rented per month. You specified the OS, and it was \"your\" machine (you didn't share it with anybody else), and you could cancel with a months notice. You could install games servers, web servers, whatever you wanted on there. The main advantage is that if the hardware failed, it was your server provider's problem, not yours. You would know your system's specs, but you'd never see the server itself.\n\nAt the bottom end of the spectrum was application-focused shared servers. You'd pay \u00a35/month and get some space on your provider's server for a web site, or for email hosting for your own domain. One of the problems with this model is that if you're sharing a server with a \"noisy neighbour\", your website or email can slow down as well as theirs.\n\nNext came the idea of the virtual server. A virtual private server (VPS), looks to an engineer to be like a dedicated server, but it's actually an imaginary server running inside a real dedicated server. It's almost like a hybrid of the previous two approaches: you're sharing a server with other people (so it's super cheap), but you are able to install what you want inside this virtual server (so it's flexible), and if the server has a hardware problem, it's not your problem.\n\nAnd that's where we were for many, many years.\n\nA lot of effort went into making virtualisation really good. One company - VMWare - got to a point where I could take a virtual server on this physical machine in this data centre, and drag it over to a completely different machine in another part of the data centre, and it would carry on working without a reboot. Quite amazing, really.\n\nLots of companies though had a problem: how many servers to buy? If you imagine that for a few days a year - say Black Friday weekend - you are incredibly busy and need 100 servers, but the rest of the year you are very quiet and only need two, how many do you buy?\n\nWell, if you're co-locating, you buy 100 servers. You need to provision enough for peak load. That's quite wasteful. If you're on dedicated servers or VPS's, you might decide to rent 2 machines 12 months of the year, and then say in October rent 98 more and get them ready, and then in December cancel them - three months for a few days is still quite wasteful.\n\nWhat people wanted was a model where they could scale just in time for when they needed the capacity, and only pay for what they used. The day after Cyber Monday, ideally I don't want to still be paying for these servers any more.\n\nAmazon knew this more than anybody - because this is what they wanted. The problem is, at Amazon's scale, this stuff only make sense if they own their own data centre. They weren't just co-locating, they were going back to the 1960s model of building physical spaces they owned for this stuff. But if they could get other businesses to share these machines with them - perhaps using the exact same model that Amazon themselves would want - it could offset the costs, and indeed move the data centres from being cost centres to profit centres.\n\nAnd so we got to cloud computing. The key things that made cloud so radically different to what came before were:\n\n1. Pricing. No monthly or annual contracts. You paid _per hour_. You press a button, a dedicated or virtual server becomes available to you. You press another button, it goes. You pay for the time it was running rounded up to the nearest hour. That meant that you could pay for a few servers in the morning, but 50 servers in the evening (if that's what you wanted), and hundreds over the holidays. This was huge.\n2. Auto-scaling. Rather than having engineers decide to scale up/down, they produced software that would look at how busy your servers were and either add more if they were busy, or turn a few off if they were quiet. This combined with the pricing was radical.\n3. Immutable server images. This is a bit weird, but when I install a normal server, it holds data, and I can change that data and I take backups, and so on. With auto-scaling, I can't: the machine might get killed off in an hour. What does it mean to \"backup a server\" if the 5 servers I have running now are not the same servers I had running yesterday? \n\nThese combined, made a lot of people rethink systems administration and what it meant to \"run\" a web site or application. It has radically changed the industry and allowed for huge efficiency savings.\n\nInterestingly, that's meant that we're now in an era where Amazon themselves and others are building tools on top of all this that aren't just virtual servers by the hour, but more like applications. Want infinite storage capacity? Here's S3. Want to install a message queueing system but getting confused about RabbitMQ? Here's SNS and SQS. Fed up of having to run an email system? OK, here's SES. And on, and on, and on.\n\nSome companies think about how to solve a developer's life a little. Heroku for example provides an interface where the developer doesn't even have to think about servers quite so much. This is called PaaS or \"platform-as-a-service\". In this model, I don't even auto-scale server, I just deploy applications.\n\nOthers have gone another route: Docker is a good example of a technology that looks at how to have auto-scaling and immutable server images but based on your own hardware, or even on cloud hardware that you scale at a layer removed. Funky.\n\nAnd then there is serverless. Serverless - AWS Lambda and Goolge Function makes the world a strange place. No longer do we think in terms of applications or servers: we think about a single function in a piece of software and just give it to the cloud to run at infinite scale, paying every time it is invoked/called, so we don't even pay for the capacity of a server we don't need in a quiet period, and the \"auto-scaling\" is automatic and seamless and needs no management.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft were late getting to the party, but they're now gunning for it, and it's getting interesting.\n\nBack in the late 1990s I had my own server, onto which I would install various things. Cost me a fortune, and I only got to co-locate it free because I worked for an ISP - I wouldn't have been able to afford it otherwise. Today I just wrote an application in for Lambda that if it got 1,000,000 hits a month would cost me perhaps $4 to run it.\n\nAnd _that's_ the difference between a server and the cloud."], [1, "A good way to differentiate is: do you know where the server is and which server it physically is? Yes? Server. No? Cloud."], [3, "\"Who owns it\".\n\nIn a \"On Premise\" environment, you (the business/consumer) own the server.  It is on your property, and you pay for the care and feeding of it.\n\nIn a \"Cloud\" environment, you (the business/consumer) do NOT own the server.  The server is on someone else's property and is maintained and cared for by their team for you.  In fact you are probably just one of many people living on the same server."], [1, "The Cloud is a marketing term. However, the age of \"The Cloud\" was really defined by the availability for firms to rent out easily replaceable virtual servers and provide those servers \"As a Service\". \n\nUsually a company would rent a server and then have to manage the OS and what software it ran. Now, you can simple deploy your custom application onto the Cloud and the service provider takes care of maintaining the Operating System.

This model of programming splits the processes a program performs into \"objects\" which perform tasks from certain inputs and give certain outputs. By splitting it up this way a programmer doesn't need to know how every aspect of the program functions in order to work on it; each object is a sort of \"black box\" where what happens inside is a mystery. An example object might be a pricing module where it takes a list of product codes and returns a total price for the order.\n\nThere likely isn't very much different in that pricing module for object-oriented programming compared to just writing the item price lookup, bulk order discounts, etc. in traditional programming form. But by doing it with the object-oriented model you can easily have multiple programmers working on the same project without interfering with each other. Someone can write a module to generate a shipping route for all the items without ever knowing about what is going on within the pricing module.\n\nBringing this back to the Cloud, the term is more for talking about using decentralized remote servers as infrastructure rather than a local hardware solution.

I'm a senior engineer with 20 years commercial experience, several of them in ISPs and Telcos, and I've been working a lot with cloud technologies for the last 6-7 years or so.\n\nTo make sense of the difference, let's go back in time and figure out what changes people made.\n\nThe very first computers were large and cumbersome. They lived in the place where they were built, and were used by the people who built them. This was the case in the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s it became possible for a computer to be built somewhere else and delivered to you. A large computer would need a specialised room, known as a \"machine room\" (although it was sometimes called a \"data centre\" to make the horrific costs more relatable at board level). A company buying a new computer would find some space in one of their buildings, raise the floor (so that power, cooling and other systems could go underneath the computer components), and the computer would be installed.\n\nIn the 1970s computers became smaller and so these machine rooms would house not one big computer, but perhaps several smaller ones - albeit quite large by today's standards.\n\nBy the 1980s computers got to a size where you could fit one on your desk. However, you'd want it to be able to talk to your company's bigger computer, or perhaps a computer in another town. Clients and servers had been around for some time, but now they became much more popular. Even smaller \"big\" computers were now put in machine rooms that were rebranded \"server rooms\" or retain the title \"data centre\".\n\nIn the 1990s, the Internet started to take off. Even before the web, small independent ISPs were popping up, each of them with very different kinds of server requirements. By now it was possible to take a standard PC, put the internals into a rack mount case, install a server operating system on it (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.), and put it in your ISPs machine room/data centre for a fixed monthly or yearly cost. This is called \"co-location\": you buy hardware, you go and install it in a data centre, and if it breaks, you need to buy replacement parts and go in and physically service it yourself.\n\nOne of my first jobs was looking after one of these sites, we'd have hundreds and hundreds of machines brought in by clients every year, and we'd rack them up, and plug them in - they'd have access to high-speed (for the time) Internet and power, and be in a climate-controlled room with good fire suppression. These rooms were not nice places to work quite often.\n\nAfter a while, somebody realised that people would want a server to host a website on, or run their own email server, but they didn't want to buy the equipment, or perhaps wanted to try it for a few months to see how well it worked before making an investment. That led to a lot of innovation.\n\nFirst, there were dedicated servers. These are machines you rented per month. You specified the OS, and it was \"your\" machine (you didn't share it with anybody else), and you could cancel with a months notice. You could install games servers, web servers, whatever you wanted on there. The main advantage is that if the hardware failed, it was your server provider's problem, not yours. You would know your system's specs, but you'd never see the server itself.\n\nAt the bottom end of the spectrum was application-focused shared servers. You'd pay \u00a35/month and get some space on your provider's server for a web site, or for email hosting for your own domain. One of the problems with this model is that if you're sharing a server with a \"noisy neighbour\", your website or email can slow down as well as theirs.\n\nNext came the idea of the virtual server. A virtual private server (VPS), looks to an engineer to be like a dedicated server, but it's actually an imaginary server running inside a real dedicated server. It's almost like a hybrid of the previous two approaches: you're sharing a server with other people (so it's super cheap), but you are able to install what you want inside this virtual server (so it's flexible), and if the server has a hardware problem, it's not your problem.\n\nAnd that's where we were for many, many years.\n\nA lot of effort went into making virtualisation really good. One company - VMWare - got to a point where I could take a virtual server on this physical machine in this data centre, and drag it over to a completely different machine in another part of the data centre, and it would carry on working without a reboot. Quite amazing, really.\n\nLots of companies though had a problem: how many servers to buy? If you imagine that for a few days a year - say Black Friday weekend - you are incredibly busy and need 100 servers, but the rest of the year you are very quiet and only need two, how many do you buy?\n\nWell, if you're co-locating, you buy 100 servers. You need to provision enough for peak load. That's quite wasteful. If you're on dedicated servers or VPS's, you might decide to rent 2 machines 12 months of the year, and then say in October rent 98 more and get them ready, and then in December cancel them - three months for a few days is still quite wasteful.\n\nWhat people wanted was a model where they could scale just in time for when they needed the capacity, and only pay for what they used. The day after Cyber Monday, ideally I don't want to still be paying for these servers any more.\n\nAmazon knew this more than anybody - because this is what they wanted. The problem is, at Amazon's scale, this stuff only make sense if they own their own data centre. They weren't just co-locating, they were going back to the 1960s model of building physical spaces they owned for this stuff. But if they could get other businesses to share these machines with them - perhaps using the exact same model that Amazon themselves would want - it could offset the costs, and indeed move the data centres from being cost centres to profit centres.\n\nAnd so we got to cloud computing. The key things that made cloud so radically different to what came before were:\n\n1. Pricing. No monthly or annual contracts. You paid _per hour_. You press a button, a dedicated or virtual server becomes available to you. You press another button, it goes. You pay for the time it was running rounded up to the nearest hour. That meant that you could pay for a few servers in the morning, but 50 servers in the evening (if that's what you wanted), and hundreds over the holidays. This was huge.\n2. Auto-scaling. Rather than having engineers decide to scale up/down, they produced software that would look at how busy your servers were and either add more if they were busy, or turn a few off if they were quiet. This combined with the pricing was radical.\n3. Immutable server images. This is a bit weird, but when I install a normal server, it holds data, and I can change that data and I take backups, and so on. With auto-scaling, I can't: the machine might get killed off in an hour. What does it mean to \"backup a server\" if the 5 servers I have running now are not the same servers I had running yesterday? \n\nThese combined, made a lot of people rethink systems administration and what it meant to \"run\" a web site or application. It has radically changed the industry and allowed for huge efficiency savings.\n\nInterestingly, that's meant that we're now in an era where Amazon themselves and others are building tools on top of all this that aren't just virtual servers by the hour, but more like applications. Want infinite storage capacity? Here's S3. Want to install a message queueing system but getting confused about RabbitMQ? Here's SNS and SQS. Fed up of having to run an email system? OK, here's SES. And on, and on, and on.\n\nSome companies think about how to solve a developer's life a little. Heroku for example provides an interface where the developer doesn't even have to think about servers quite so much. This is called PaaS or \"platform-as-a-service\". In this model, I don't even auto-scale server, I just deploy applications.\n\nOthers have gone another route: Docker is a good example of a technology that looks at how to have auto-scaling and immutable server images but based on your own hardware, or even on cloud hardware that you scale at a layer removed. Funky.\n\nAnd then there is serverless. Serverless - AWS Lambda and Goolge Function makes the world a strange place. No longer do we think in terms of applications or servers: we think about a single function in a piece of software and just give it to the cloud to run at infinite scale, paying every time it is invoked/called, so we don't even pay for the capacity of a server we don't need in a quiet period, and the \"auto-scaling\" is automatic and seamless and needs no management.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft were late getting to the party, but they're now gunning for it, and it's getting interesting.\n\nBack in the late 1990s I had my own server, onto which I would install various things. Cost me a fortune, and I only got to co-locate it free because I worked for an ISP - I wouldn't have been able to afford it otherwise. Today I just wrote an application in for Lambda that if it got 1,000,000 hits a month would cost me perhaps $4 to run it.\n\nAnd _that's_ the difference between a server and the cloud.", "id": "daph7go"}], [{"comment": "A good way to differentiate is: do you know where the server is and which server it physically is?

But we can never know for sure."], [1866, "They very earliest humans may not have known, but they instinctively wanted to have sex anyway. It would have been pretty easy to figure out after that because only the people having sex had babies. The effects also aren't that delayed. A pregnant woman will miss her period, which would be pretty noticeable, especially after the second month. It's also possible that humans would have figured it out from watching animals for hunting and observing their mating cycles (or from domestication of animals, but that came later).\n\nHowever, the exact mechanism remained unknown for some time and there were all sorts of misunderstandings about reproduction in the ancient world. For example, the ancient Greeks thought all inherited traits came from the father and a lot of medieval Europeans believed that a woman had to orgasm to get pregnant, etc., but they all knew that sex lead to babies.\n\nEdit: I should say, there is no way to know for certain because we don't have records from that time. We can speculate based on some of the artifacts that exist and what humans would have been able to observe, but will never get beyond that without a time machine. As a result, I don't mean my answer to apply universally to all groups of humans. It's meant to explain how many groups could have figured it out from a number of ways. That's not to say every group did because, once again, we cannot know. It's pretty well accepted that people had made the connection for the most part at least 12,000 years ago, but it could have been far earlier.\n\nEdit 2: One problem with this question is what it means to \"know\" something. Some people today don't know that sex leads to pregnancy, but I wouldn't say modern people don't know that. It's very likely that there were quite a few people throughout time that thought sex didn't lead to pregnancy. It's also likely that some early humans suspected what was going on, but couldn't confirm it or weren't believed by others. And of course some groups of people figured it out before others. "], [1143, "I want to provide a counterpoint to a lot of the posts saying \"humans would *simply* observe it\" or \"women would just remember they had sex three months prior\". The \"pattern\" for pregnancy is an extremely difficult one to recognize and most humans would not casually observe this and it was most likely one or a few isolated discoveries then spread as knowledge. Most of the posters calling this 'simple observation' are not looking at this objectively due to their current knowledge and overestimating human pattern recognition over extended time. Let's look at what it would actually take to make this connection and why it's so hard:\n\n* First of all you have at most n=1 chance every 9 months to recognize let alone confirm this pattern in yourself. \n\n* Second, the cause (sex) happens many times more than the result in a semi-random pattern, so if anything the obvious \"pattern\" is sex = no result. \n\n* Third, the time gap of a few months makes it incredibly hard to make the connection, even harder if we're talking about pre-calendar civilization. Without looking or thinking of the date do you have any idea what you did 3 months ago? You're overestimating our ability to recognize patterns over time (without deliberate experimentation). For example, until the recent public education about Celiac's disease there have been thousands/millions of *modern* humans that live for years with this disease, a disease with severe symptoms that appear *within a day* of eating wheat, and could have been cured merely by recognizing a simple pattern. \n\n* Fourth, we have to acknowledge competing explanations. Supernatural explanations and other theories could further cloud pattern recognition. A simple illustration of this effect is millions believed masturbation caused sterility into the last century despite being easy to recognize this pattern is not true at all. Ubiquity of pregnancy lore in ancient civilizations would likely derail the pattern recognition process before it began for many. \n\nA few made this connection but my point is most humans miss obvious patterns with more than a couple hours' delay like this example. And when you multiply the time scale by 90x days *plus* obfuscate the pattern with a high pregnancy failure rate with sex (lots of sex with zero result) *plus* make this pattern only testable about once a year you have a near impossible pattern for any human to casually recognize. \n"], [2051, "Many probably didn't. I remember as an undergrad reading about a tribe of people that had an abnormal amount of albinism. It was especially peculiar because the tribe in question regarded albinism very negatively. You were a second-class citizen. So some anthropologists went to figure out how and why they had such a high rate.\n\nWell it turned out that when the men went off hunting, sometimes for days at a time, they left the albino men at home because they weren't really men. You can guess what happened from there. So the anthropologists asked them how babies were made. They were made, according to the tribe, when a woman goes down to the river fetch water. An ancestor spirit inhabits her belly and a child is born. The anthropologists, being bad anthropologists, told them how babies were really made. The tribespeople laughed at them, saying in effect \"We have sex all the time! There would be thousands of babies if what you're saying is true! No, it's ancestor ghosts.\" \n\nAnd thus many more albino children were born to that tribe.\n\nEdit: Since this thread is locked I can't respond to people. I honestly don't remember the source except that it was in one of my anthropology classes. This was ~2002. It's just something that stuck with me.

On a few Polynesian islands where some of the staple foods have a very mild contraceptive property, the link was never realized (this led them to be among the most sex-positive societies ever). I think they believed in reincarnation so they thought pregnancy occurred when a spirit of someone crawled into the woman and a body started developing. \n\nOn the other hand, there were some cultures that believed that once a woman was pregnant, every man who had sex with her contributed material to the baby and were therefore partially responsible for it."], [543, "Fun Fact, there are still tribes in New Guinea that don't believe that sex leads to pregnancy, and it leads itself to animal husbandry being the root of our understanding of sex = kids.  \n\nThe tribe tends to have very... open relationships as a result as sex is simply something that feels good and creates bonds.  They believe that pregnancy occurs when spirits from the forests find their way into the bodies of women around the time of their menstrual cycle.  \n\nThe reason it lends itself to animal husbandry being the link is that New Guinea tribes don't have any domesticated animals.

"], [44, "Wow, there are a lot of men in this thread. \n\nSpeaking from personal experience, this is how I'd explain it in the clearest terms possible: \n\nImagine you're a woman in an ancient society. Every month you have to deal with inconvenient, painful, and sometimes dangerous bleeding. You have sex, and then the bleeding stops for a couple months, and you start to notice changes. \n\nThe changes to a woman's pregnant body happen very quickly. When I was pregnant, I knew the first week, even before I took a test. Let's play the devil's advocate and say I knew what to look for. Still, I started feeling violently sick in the mornings the first week, which would also be incredibly inconvenient in an ancient society. Not long after, I had strange cravings for weird foods I wouldn't normally combine. I noticed body changes (tender, larger breasts) after only 2-3 weeks. And after a month I was exhausted all the time. \n\nIf this happened to one woman, in a tiny tribe, once every 3 years, then I can definitely understand how ancient people wouldn't put the puzzle together. But I imagine you're talking about a larger/more complicated society, like a tribe of nomads or even a small village.\n\nCombine that with an idea that perhaps ancient civilizations of that size had a patriarchal hierarchy, and women who were \"unmarried\" (whatever the marital custom might have been) rarely had babies.\n\nI imagine these ideas wouldn't be that hard to piece together seeing as the symptoms would make life very difficult in an ancient society, and pregnant women need more care to survive, even at the very beginning. Women talk to each other about their health, emotions, and sex lives in the modern day, and I imagine it was much the same in ancient times. I'm certain a village with 5-10 births a year would understand the causal relationship, maybe without a perfect understanding of the time frame, but causal nonetheless. "], [18, "The most plausible thing I ever read supposed that women most likely knew about the connection between sex and children before men. And maybe knew for a very long time, possibly only revealed to each other after a certain (old) age (think mid-wives).\n\nAt that point in our history we were almost certainly tribal. Children were viewed at that time as being members of the MOTHER's clan/tribe. Children came from a woman, the woman comes from a tribe... Not so much an issue for intra-tribal relations, but one of the ways we evolved into societies was by swapping women between tribes (for the purposes of creating a pact/peace between neighboring tribes). We can see evidence of this practice all throughout our history right up until today (royalty from different kingdoms marrying to benefit both, arranged marriages, etc). \n\nMen probably didn't sort it out for themselves until the domestication of animals, maybe sheep or some other animal which required all day tending. Even then it probably took a couple centuries of sitting around watching the animals before they put 2 and 2 together (just joking on that part!).\n\nOnce men did figure it out it most likely changed the entire dynamic of society. Once men realized they were the \"cause\" of pregnancy, they almost certainly took control of it. Think dominance over women and children, because now wives and children as viewed as property, i.e \"belonging\" to the man who impregnated the woman. Now not only did the children belong to the MAN's clan/tribe, but so did the woman he made pregnant. \n\nThis would around the time different cultures started practices such as locking wives in the home, covering women head to toe, and restricting their ability to be in public (so as not to temp other men from stealing what is theirs).\n\nWhat do y'all think?\n\nEdits: clarify some points, eliminate some cruft."], [45, "In \"The King Killer Chronicle\" series by Patrick Rothfuss, there is a matriarchal society of people that think women just make babies on their own.

This is the point you're looking for, as religion tended to slow down or at least organize sex to allow for more direct population control.\n\nConsequentially, today people are too uncomfortable talking about sex to teach it to their own children, so they have to attend special sex-ed classes to learn if they haven't already started watching porn on the internet.\n\n\n"], [8, "Interestingly, in Patrick Rothfuss' *Name of the Wind*, there is a society that considers itself to be much more advanced than the rest of the world.

Without the actual science to prove it, nor a general understanding of that science (most people know sex = babies, but not the minutiae of it) he's left with a series of fallacies trying to prove it. Sex leads to babies, but only sometimes. The baby will have traits from both its parents, but not always. A black and a white cat could have sex, and then a bunch of babies would come out as black, white, or both, except for when an orange one pops out.\n\nWithout quoting existing scientific research and trusting the outcome of those scientists, there's almost no way to prove pregnancy is caused by sex."], [27, "Babies come out of the vagina.

It's very likely that there were quite a few people throughout time that thought sex didn't lead to pregnancy.

The \"pattern\" for pregnancy is an extremely difficult one to recognize and most humans would not casually observe this and it was most likely one or a few isolated discoveries then spread as knowledge. Most of the posters calling this 'simple observation' are not looking at this objectively due to their current knowledge and overestimating human pattern recognition over extended time. Let's look at what it would actually take to make this connection and why it's so hard:\n\n* First of all you have at most n=1 chance every 9 months to recognize let alone confirm this pattern in yourself. \n\n* Second, the cause (sex) happens many times more than the result in a semi-random pattern, so if anything the obvious \"pattern\" is sex = no result. \n\n* Third, the time gap of a few months makes it incredibly hard to make the connection, even harder if we're talking about pre-calendar civilization. Without looking or thinking of the date do you have any idea what you did 3 months ago? You're overestimating our ability to recognize patterns over time (without deliberate experimentation). For example, until the recent public education about Celiac's disease there have been thousands/millions of *modern* humans that live for years with this disease, a disease with severe symptoms that appear *within a day* of eating wheat, and could have been cured merely by recognizing a simple pattern. \n\n* Fourth, we have to acknowledge competing explanations. Supernatural explanations and other theories could further cloud pattern recognition. A simple illustration of this effect is millions believed masturbation caused sterility into the last century despite being easy to recognize this pattern is not true at all. Ubiquity of pregnancy lore in ancient civilizations would likely derail the pattern recognition process before it began for many. \n\nA few made this connection but my point is most humans miss obvious patterns with more than a couple hours' delay like this example. And when you multiply the time scale by 90x days *plus* obfuscate the pattern with a high pregnancy failure rate with sex (lots of sex with zero result) *plus* make this pattern only testable about once a year you have a near impossible pattern for any human to casually recognize. \n", "id": "dao1zoc"}], [{"comment": "Many probably didn't.

Every month you have to deal with inconvenient, painful, and sometimes dangerous bleeding. You have sex, and then the bleeding stops for a couple months, and you start to notice changes. \n\nThe changes to a woman's pregnant body happen very quickly. When I was pregnant, I knew the first week, even before I took a test. Let's play the devil's advocate and say I knew what to look for. Still, I started feeling violently sick in the mornings the first week, which would also be incredibly inconvenient in an ancient society. Not long after, I had strange cravings for weird foods I wouldn't normally combine. I noticed body changes (tender, larger breasts) after only 2-3 weeks. And after a month I was exhausted all the time. \n\nIf this happened to one woman, in a tiny tribe, once every 3 years, then I can definitely understand how ancient people wouldn't put the puzzle together. But I imagine you're talking about a larger/more complicated society, like a tribe of nomads or even a small village.\n\nCombine that with an idea that perhaps ancient civilizations of that size had a patriarchal hierarchy, and women who were \"unmarried\" (whatever the marital custom might have been) rarely had babies.\n\nI imagine these ideas wouldn't be that hard to piece together seeing as the symptoms would make life very difficult in an ancient society, and pregnant women need more care to survive, even at the very beginning. Women talk to each other about their health, emotions, and sex lives in the modern day, and I imagine it was much the same in ancient times. I'm certain a village with 5-10 births a year would understand the causal relationship, maybe without a perfect understanding of the time frame, but causal nonetheless.

Children were viewed at that time as being members of the MOTHER's clan/tribe. Children came from a woman, the woman comes from a tribe... Not so much an issue for intra-tribal relations, but one of the ways we evolved into societies was by swapping women between tribes (for the purposes of creating a pact/peace between neighboring tribes). We can see evidence of this practice all throughout our history right up until today (royalty from different kingdoms marrying to benefit both, arranged marriages, etc). \n\nMen probably didn't sort it out for themselves until the domestication of animals, maybe sheep or some other animal which required all day tending. Even then it probably took a couple centuries of sitting around watching the animals before they put 2 and 2 together (just joking on that part!).\n\nOnce men did figure it out it most likely changed the entire dynamic of society. Once men realized they were the \"cause\" of pregnancy, they almost certainly took control of it.

The CPU is a collection of (small) electronics called transistors arranged in a way to form logical units, such as an \"adder\" or an \"inverter\" (which perform boolean logic, which is basically just true/false logic using voltage as true and no voltage as false), and \"state\" devices called registers. \n\nNaturally, in electrical engineering, the devices that hold electrical charge are called capacitors. Registers take it another step and have a self feeding loop with will keep their state \"stable\" as long as power is flowing. The reason we need a \"stable\" loop is because current flows in a circuit and it's not possible to check a \"state\" if we can't ensure that it will be the same value if we attempt to observe it (that is, we don't want to change the voltage just by connecting a measuring device, like a capacitor would behave.\n\nSo data physically looks like a bunch of tiny transistors in a collection arranged as \"registers\" with a self feeding voltage loop which will either have voltage or will not have voltage (*caveat at the bottom). How it physically downloads? It talks to its IO device (in this case some network device that is physically either a wire connected electrically to a router connected physically to infrastructure, or a radio).

The CPU is a collection of (small) electronics called transistors arranged in a way to form logical units, such as an \"adder\" or an \"inverter\" (which perform boolean logic, which is basically just true/false logic using voltage as true and no voltage as false), and \"state\" devices called registers. \n\nNaturally, in electrical engineering, the devices that hold electrical charge are called capacitors. Registers take it another step and have a self feeding loop with will keep their state \"stable\" as long as power is flowing. The reason we need a \"stable\" loop is because current flows in a circuit and it's not possible to check a \"state\" if we can't ensure that it will be the same value if we attempt to observe it (that is, we don't want to change the voltage just by connecting a measuring device, like a capacitor would behave.\n\nSo data physically looks like a bunch of tiny transistors in a collection arranged as \"registers\" with a self feeding voltage loop which will either have voltage or will not have voltage (*caveat at the bottom). How it physically downloads? It talks to its IO device (in this case some network device that is physically either a wire connected electrically to a router connected physically to infrastructure, or a radio). The IO device will send a request for data somewhere else and the data will be send back to the IO device, where the CPU will read it like any IO device like storage. \n\nOf course, there's a concept of serialization.

This I think a good place to start is \"where we were in 2007\" and \"how far we got. \n\nThe first days of the collapse would probably feel a lot like normal (similar how it was in 2007). There wouldn't necessarily be a 0-day where everything suddenly breaks out in fires and riots. People might still show up to work to clock in. Services would still be delivered. Utilities would remain up. \n\nThe first indicator would be with small businesses. They'd start realizing their revenue isn't enough to pay the bills and lay off some of their employees or order less inventory. When it got bad enough, they'd take a loan from the bank, hoping the business recovers soon. They haven't failed yet and some businesses might last a bit longer than others - some feel it sooner some later. The pre-stage wouldn't be felt all that hard, but would definitely be measurable. Think somewhere like Dunkin Donuts. Every morning a percentage of people stop in for their morning coffee before the beginning of their shifts. The location employs enough people to handle the morning rush. After the job loss begins, less and less regulars come in to locations like that - as they can't afford to. They don't have the disposable income to. Thus they make less money. Thus they begin lowering the number of employees on location. That would continue to trickle through the entire supply chain - less shipments from warehouses, less production demanded, etc., All of those jobs would be at risk. Now those employees join the pool of the unemployed small business employees. \n\nWe're still not to where 07-08 was. \n\nThe first stage would happen when banks are receiving a large number of small loan requests from small businesses. The most at-risk small businesses have burned through their reserves, cut to as few employees as they possibly can, and still need money to meet payroll. They'd take small loan after small loan to continue as long as they can. Each time, the interest rate goes up as they're more risky. Not only that, but the banks start to notice all of these requests coming in for \"payroll\", \"inventory\", etc., They might panic and have extreme sales just to try and break even and unload inventory - doing so would cut the profitability across the industry. It'd be a short-term bandaid that'll pay this months bills, but they wont be able to continue it for long. Meanwhile, those with money are burning through it.\n\nThe first round of failures would start. The most vulnerable would go first - like \"Party Perfect\" in the strip mall, \"Molly's Cupcake Emporium,\" \"Jimmy's Serbian Pub\" etc., From the banking side, they'd see all of those loans suddenly go to collections. They'd have the assets that the businesses owned - like inventory, buildings, cars, houses - etc., Those would start to be auctioned off/liquidated - hurting manufacturers/warehouses. After that you'd have less and less regulars at Dunkin - more layoffs. At the same time, your mortgages/car loans begin to fail. \n\nNow.. banks would be getting more and more loan requests - now from bigger businesses. Unfortunately, banks would have to get more picky-choosy with their loans. That means higher interest and more dilligence. The banks wont loan as loosely as they would prior. Previously, as Molly's Cupcake Emporium and home owners sent their monthly payment in, they'd use that money to loan to another business. That money no longer comes in. Not only that, but a hierarchy above would start failing - ie your Circuit Cities, Blockbusters, Hummer, Newsweek etc., \n\nThis is about where the 07/08 recession stopped crashing. Our government decided bail the banks out on condition that they loaned money affordably to smaller businesses. They gave \"incentives\" (a workaround word for tax cuts) for purchasing equipment to get the plants pumping out products. That resulted in locked-in business and eased fears. The biggest recipient being GM, who benefited from easier car loans, cash for clunkers, and a government buyout. \n\nHad that not happened, let's continue with our doom. The recession likely would have kept creeping up. Banks would have loaned only to those at the top of the top. Dunkin franchises in bad locations might begin being a candidate for closing their doors as well. Land lords probably wouldn't be receiving their payments - nor would banks for mortgages.\n\nThe court system would overflow with eviction notices. Odds are, they'd be so overflowed that they could process with a due process. Hell, the entire judicial system/government/local police would start running out of money (as less tax revenue is being made). At which point, our own government would depend on foreign loans to fund them. Seeing as the US is still one of the most innovative economies, I'd be surprised if we didn't find some stability - but *assuming we dont*. \n\nAt this point, grocery stores are probably more of a luxury. If we look at the USSR and the crash of the ruble, this is around where food lines began. People would wait in line for hours for loaves of bread. The USD would start being devalued - black markets would control food prices (Can be seen in Venezuela ATM). \n\nThe smaller police departments no longer receiving funding might start acting \"outside of the rules.\" They might become mercenaries - who knows. At this point, the government probably wouldn't maintain control in all major regions (I'd argue they'd have the tools to do-so - so this is unlikely.) At which point, based on other collapses, we'd probably shift to military control when the police forces no longer did their job. Likely this would be a result of rioting/civil unrest from people with guns defending their property. Or landlord evicting their tenants with hired former police. \n\nThe government would probably brand military control as a coup. As would people who didn't trust the military. Police would likely side with bureaucrats, as would \"patriotic loyalists\". There would be some struggle of power between government loyalists (remaining police forces) and the military. The military would probably win after some civil-war-esque skirmishes. Once again, I highly doubt we'd get to this unless some major aspects changed - vs what we saw in 2007-2008.\n\nGiven a few years or couple decades, we'd probably return to a pseudo democracy. It'd be more of a systemic crash in a scenario where \"if 07-08 got worse\" - IE the Soviet Unions collapse in 1991 which didn't get as bad as I described in most areas (less some satellite countries that went to shit). And yes they had a decade of shit, but 25 years later they're absolutely a world power again. \n\nIf you go the \"EMP STRIKE\" route, the major difference is that you wouldn't see a systemic financial collapse. It'd be more like supply runs IE Jimmy Carter gas shortage - except with food and such. It'd be like Hurricane Sandy's empty grocery stores. It'd be like Hurricane Katrinas lack of state government. It'd be like the LA Riots massive unrest. Then probably military rule. \n\nEDIT: Sure that's not all-inclusive and after 07-08 scenario it's mostly speculation/light observation of other periods of civil unrest. I commented on your post because my background is in Finance & accounting and thus feel I have a pretty good grasp of what happened around that time. If the collapse was bad enough (or in a more minor SE Asian/Eastern European country/South American country) I'd say the path up until military rule would be fairly accurate - including the worthlessness of currency + rise of the black market. Conceptualizing the US having a financial collapse that results in the USD being completely devalued is hard to consider primarily because it is so bound to the rest of the world and thus we probably have the highest chance of maintaining control.

They'd take small loan after small loan to continue as long as they can. Each time, the interest rate goes up as they're more risky. Not only that, but the banks start to notice all of these requests coming in for \"payroll\", \"inventory\", etc., They might panic and have extreme sales just to try and break even and unload inventory - doing so would cut the profitability across the industry. It'd be a short-term bandaid that'll pay this months bills, but they wont be able to continue it for long. Meanwhile, those with money are burning through it.\n\nThe first round of failures would start. The most vulnerable would go first - like \"Party Perfect\" in the strip mall, \"Molly's Cupcake Emporium,\" \"Jimmy's Serbian Pub\" etc., From the banking side, they'd see all of those loans suddenly go to collections. They'd have the assets that the businesses owned - like inventory, buildings, cars, houses - etc., Those would start to be auctioned off/liquidated - hurting manufacturers/warehouses. After that you'd have less and less regulars at Dunkin - more layoffs. At the same time, your mortgages/car loans begin to fail. \n\nNow.. banks would be getting more and more loan requests - now from bigger businesses. Unfortunately, banks would have to get more picky-choosy with their loans. That means higher interest and more dilligence. The banks wont loan as loosely as they would prior. Previously, as Molly's Cupcake Emporium and home owners sent their monthly payment in, they'd use that money to loan to another business. That money no longer comes in. Not only that, but a hierarchy above would start failing - ie your Circuit Cities, Blockbusters, Hummer, Newsweek etc., \n\nThis is about where the 07/08 recession stopped crashing. Our government decided bail the banks out on condition that they loaned money affordably to smaller businesses. They gave \"incentives\" (a workaround word for tax cuts) for purchasing equipment to get the plants pumping out products. That resulted in locked-in business and eased fears. The biggest recipient being GM, who benefited from easier car loans, cash for clunkers, and a government buyout. \n\nHad that not happened, let's continue with our doom. The recession likely would have kept creeping up. Banks would have loaned only to those at the top of the top. Dunkin franchises in bad locations might begin being a candidate for closing their doors as well. Land lords probably wouldn't be receiving their payments - nor would banks for mortgages.\n\nThe court system would overflow with eviction notices. Odds are, they'd be so overflowed that they could process with a due process. Hell, the entire judicial system/government/local police would start running out of money (as less tax revenue is being made). At which point, our own government would depend on foreign loans to fund them. Seeing as the US is still one of the most innovative economies, I'd be surprised if we didn't find some stability - but *assuming we dont*. \n\nAt this point, grocery stores are probably more of a luxury. If we look at the USSR and the crash of the ruble, this is around where food lines began. People would wait in line for hours for loaves of bread. The USD would start being devalued - black markets would control food prices (Can be seen in Venezuela ATM). \n\nThe smaller police departments no longer receiving funding might start acting \"outside of the rules.\" They might become mercenaries - who knows. At this point, the government probably wouldn't maintain control in all major regions (I'd argue they'd have the tools to do-so - so this is unlikely.) At which point, based on other collapses, we'd probably shift to military control when the police forces no longer did their job. Likely this would be a result of rioting/civil unrest from people with guns defending their property. Or landlord evicting their tenants with hired former police. \n\nThe government would probably brand military control as a coup. As would people who didn't trust the military. Police would likely side with bureaucrats, as would \"patriotic loyalists\". There would be some struggle of power between government loyalists (remaining police forces) and the military. The military would probably win after some civil-war-esque skirmishes. Once again, I highly doubt we'd get to this unless some major aspects changed - vs what we saw in 2007-2008.\n\nGiven a few years or couple decades, we'd probably return to a pseudo democracy. It'd be more of a systemic crash in a scenario where \"if 07-08 got worse\" - IE the Soviet Unions collapse in 1991 which didn't get as bad as I described in most areas (less some satellite countries that went to shit). And yes they had a decade of shit, but 25 years later they're absolutely a world power again. \n\nIf you go the \"EMP STRIKE\" route, the major difference is that you wouldn't see a systemic financial collapse. It'd be more like supply runs IE Jimmy Carter gas shortage - except with food and such. It'd be like Hurricane Sandy's empty grocery stores. It'd be like Hurricane Katrinas lack of state government. It'd be like the LA Riots massive unrest. Then probably military rule. \n\nEDIT: Sure that's not all-inclusive and after 07-08 scenario it's mostly speculation/light observation of other periods of civil unrest. I commented on your post because my background is in Finance & accounting and thus feel I have a pretty good grasp of what happened around that time. If the collapse was bad enough (or in a more minor SE Asian/Eastern European country/South American country) I'd say the path up until military rule would be fairly accurate - including the worthlessness of currency + rise of the black market. Conceptualizing the US having a financial collapse that results in the USD being completely devalued is hard to consider primarily because it is so bound to the rest of the world and thus we probably have the highest chance of maintaining control.

Truthfully, I don't recall a big \"shift\" - I knew it was one of the worst recessions fairly early on, but honestly things felt much like before. It just kind of gradually got a little shitter - but honestly, people seemed more grateful. Some people got hit harder than others and lost their houses - so I'm sure other people got hit a lot harder than my family did. \n\nI remember the shelves in stores seeming a bit emptier. I started working Seasonal at Target at the time and was surprised how the shelves were half empty at times. They didn't keep more than 1 of the 5 seasonal employees that year - usually they kept all of them.  Right out of college I worked there again - I remember the store seeming a lot \"fuller\" then. Like, we'd have the home/electronics areas stocked to the brim. During the recession, we had only a couple of each product. Not sure if that was due to that or what. \n\n>I understand it's like a worst of the worst case scenarios but I always hear this mention if complete financial collapse and was wondering what the actual ramifications of it would be\n\nKeep in mind, that's worst of the worst examples. Those would be the highlights - not the \"daily life.\" You'd have one riot here, one failing local government there. The human race is pretty persistent - at the end of the day when shit starts failing, the first thing people will do is try to get it back up when the dust clears. No one wants to fight a decade long civil war without commerce, currency, etc., So yes, it sounds bad, but it really isn't as bad as one might think. Plus, you'd be in it together - not alone.\n\nI think the most modern example of a superpower failing was the USSR in 1991. It might be worth researching that if you're interested. Most of it took place behind closed doors - when [the actual coup itself happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt), it was fairly quick and relatively peaceful. Within a week, Gorbachev had both resigned and the USSR dissolved. There was a brief military curfew, but nothing like internment camps like you see in a movies. Military rule is usually just a \"let's put the country in lockdown until we can figure out WTF to do\". The full effects played out over a decade, but it never reached \"post-apocalyptic movie\" style craziness. [Here's are some great visuals](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2255693/Last-pictures-life-iron-curtain-collapse-USSR.html) to put it into perspective.

I'll try to talk about the most common \"parasite\" rebuttal in attempting to say that viruses themselves are alive.\n\nWhen the idea of viruses not being alive is brought up the most common rebuttal is that other parasites, like malaria, also need a host of sorts. Even humans can\u2019t live without the earth, but we are still \u201calive\u201d. Without a host or a planet both will die, and the same can be said of a virus. And, if you are like most people and scientists, you will likely say that a virus and the discrete infectious particles that encode for more viral particles are one and the same. Not everyone thinks this way, but it is by far the most common perspective.\n\nWith that being said, take a human, a malaria cell, and a virus particle and stuff them into an impenetrable box. By cutting off their contact from all environmental forces, they will invariably die, if they ever were alive. However, what is important is what happens before they die and how this behavior might be different from before they are put into the box.\n\nThe human in a box is still alive the instant he is placed there. He might yell, scream, bang on the wall, and so on. For the time being he is alive until he runs out of air, or, if the box is big enough, dehydrates and dies. These are the obvious \"macro\" signs we associate with life. But that's not what we mean when we say that \"cells\" are alive or that \"viruses\" aren't.\n\nFor the malaria it is no longer in a red-blood cell. However the instant I place it in the box it can still process the energy stores it made--just like the human. It still undergoes metabolism, creating new proteins, breaking down others, synthesizing lipids for its cell membrane and intracellular compartments. It still unwinds the DNA it contains, transcribes a template, and uses that to make a protein. It might even divide, depending on the state it was when it went into the box. [Edit: These are the \"micro\" or most fundamental signs of life we can ascribe to a cell.] Eventually, though, it will die just like the human.\n\nIn both of the above cases the human and the malaria still exhibit behaviors classically associated with life even after being placed into the box. They both invariably die, but the point here is that there are two distinct times for these organisms qualitatively.\n\n\nFinally, we get to the virus. Before placed it in the box it was doing nothing--just sitting there, inert. Viruses do this until they bump into a cell or the cell bumps into them. Here in this box it will never come into contact with a cell. It sits there forever, inert, just as before with no reprieve. There is no energy production or energy manipulation. There is no protein synthesis. There is only the vibrating of its atoms and the random movement of its molecules in their aqueous environment inside the core. The virus remains like this until it eventually degrades, the same way ultrapasteurized milk degrades. Not degraded by life, but by the fundamental protein, lipid, and nucleic acid bonds eventually just...breaking. It is the same degradation a rock undergoes being exposed to flowing rapids for eons. It is the same degradation that causes pigment over time to bleach. Entropy wins, as usual, but there was never a fight along the way. There was never, at any point, something that for the time being still fought for order.\n\nIn essence, the virus was already dead. Or, better stated, never alive to begin with. Viruses are parasites to the limit such that they no longer can be thought of as living. Or, coming from the other direction, they are extremely complicated and selfish genetic elements.\n\nThey are \"shadows of life\" and most likely derived from a living organism or reductively evolved themselves.\n\nEdit: Check out [this video](http://naturedocumentaries.org/3972/hidden-life-cell-bbc/) that's very layman friendly. It's a BBQ documentary about an hour long that covers the lifecycle of Adenovirus, in this case the common cold. You can really see how ancient viruses are based on the many defense mechanisms our cells and bodies have gained to fight them off. At times it's a bit dramatic and not quite \"accurate\" with how things work on that level (e.g. with some personification), but on the whole it's very educational and can really help illustrate the point I was making above with a specific viral example. The typo stays.\n\nEdit: As I implied a bit in the beginning this is not the only view of viruses out there. If you're really curious you can check out [Dr. Forterre's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837877/) writing on the matter. In this case, the 'virus' is not the discrete particles outside of a cell but rather the infected cell itself. It's quite an interesting and unique idea and the article itself talks at great length about the many exceptions that biology offers up in general and also specifically those many viral exceptions and edge cases.\n\nEdit3: Alternatively, if you would like to really see what this metabolism is like and see what we truly mean by describing these \"micro\" signs of life, check out this 8 minute video [by Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBmLsPeuv6k) that centers on the cellular activity of a white blood cell leaving a vein to fight an infection. It requires dynamic response to a changing environment and can serve as a good contrasting element to what viruses are incapable of doing *on their own*.\n\n"], [293, "It is sort of on the edge of life and wether it is included or not depends on how we define life.\n\nIt show that our way of categorizing things like that does not always work for natural phenomena which often show a more gradual transition between one state and another rather than a simply yes/no thing.\n\nViruses are right there in between dead and alive. They can only really \"live\" with the help of host cells they infect, but with their help they can actually fulfill most of the criteria people use to measure if something is alive.\n\nOf course if you include viruses you only really transfer the problem of where to draw a line further out.\n\nYou have things like prions which are sort of like viruses only much more simply and much less alive. They don't even have any DNA/RNA. But it seems that they definitely can reproduce inside a host and research suggest that they can sort of mutate, evolve and adapt through natural selection.\n\nYou have to draw the line somewhere and no matter where you draw it, it will be imperfect because there will be things on both sides of the line that aren't too different from one another.\n\nDrawing the line to keep viruses on the dead side of the dead/alive divide makes sense. We just have to keep in mind that the whole are is rather fuzzy and that it is more of a gradual shift as you move across it."], [71, "It actually depends on the definition of life that is being considered. There are actually several.\n\nThe definition most often referenced (the \"biological definition of life\") requires an organism to be able to carry out metabolic processes on its own - that is, via its own cellular machinery - in order to be considered living.\n\nViruses cannot metabolize and reproduce on their own, and instead must rely on the cellular machinery of its host in order to carry out functions that other organisms can perform \"independently.\"\n\nI put that last term in quotes, because, like many things in biology, gray areas start to blur the lines between these neat little divisions we like to draw in nature. When we start to consider other obligate parasites, this definition becomes problematic, as they may be reduced to such a high degree (both in terms of cellular machinery/function and genome size/organization) that they too begin to push the boundary of what we consider to be living based on the classical definition(s)."], [75, "There is actually no agreed upon definition of life in Biology, see the [wikipage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Biology) for this. However, when people are talking about how a virus is not considered life, they usually come with their Biology textbook definition of life, which is sort of as followed; \n\nLife should contain at least most of the following characteristics; \n\n- homeostasis; [hard to ELI5] cells should be able to maintain a different environment than the outside environment \n- Organization; more or less that it should look like how we know life looks like, consisting of cell(s), DNA/RNA [a weak point to be honest]\n- Metabolism; produce energy for itself either by eating or sunlight and using this energy.\n- Growth; producing more energy than using it\n- Respons to stimuli; react to something, say a human to a red light\n- Reproduction; the ability to create 'children' or copies (as microbes do) \n\nIn general it is said that all these traits should be within the organism to be able to call it life. So because a virus does not have its own metabolism and it cannot reproduce without help of a host it is sometimes considered to be not life. Biologists are - I think - kind of split on the matter. Still Virology is a subject within Biology. Also this is not the only problem with the definition above. There are some people that argue that for example fire contains most of the traits above (except for the organization). So a relatively new idea is to go with a new definition of life; life is able to undergo evolution. \n\nNow in my opinion this is the strongest definition of life. Evolution is seen in everything that is living and not in lifeless objects. One of the consequences of this theory is that the virus would thus actually be considered life, since it is undergoing evolution. Again, there is no agreement between biologists, but I see this becoming the new definition in the future, since (again my opinion) there is not really any argument against it, other than being too familiar with the previous definition. \n\n**tl:dr** It depends on who you ask, some say a virus is not living because it does not reproduce and create its own energy, others would say a virus is life because it evolves. \n\n**edit** Woops, see it has gotten a bit more of attention than I thought and some people are upset by my 'amateur' answer. I wanted to put it simple since; ELI5. You can agree or dissagree with the evolution notion, this happens within the field of Biology as well. For disclaimers, I am not an evolutionary biologist, although I did follow a lot of courses within the subject. Nor am I a micro-biologist, (some courses). The growth thing; yes I understand the confusion, I should have put; use energy for production of biomass (or have a surplus of energy used for biomass production). Honest mistake, but I'll leave it. \n\nAs for the evolution part; yes I mean evolution by means of natural selection. Again it is ELI5 .. Sorry if you think I was misleading people, I am not. Sorry if it was not elaborate enough, but this is my response. If you want a more elaborate discussion maybe try askscience instead (because it is a really interesting discussion).

What you're taking from it is life, or its ability to animate from its virion state.\n\nEdit: the possessive its."]], [[{"comment": "You've gotten some good answers that address the point but some common rebuttals and misconceptions are being put forth. I'll try to talk about the most common \"parasite\" rebuttal in attempting to say that viruses themselves are alive.\n\nWhen the idea of viruses not being alive is brought up the most common rebuttal is that other parasites, like malaria, also need a host of sorts. Even humans can\u2019t live without the earth, but we are still \u201calive\u201d. Without a host or a planet both will die, and the same can be said of a virus. And, if you are like most people and scientists, you will likely say that a virus and the discrete infectious particles that encode for more viral particles are one and the same. Not everyone thinks this way, but it is by far the most common perspective.\n\nWith that being said, take a human, a malaria cell, and a virus particle and stuff them into an impenetrable box. By cutting off their contact from all environmental forces, they will invariably die, if they ever were alive. However, what is important is what happens before they die and how this behavior might be different from before they are put into the box.\n\nThe human in a box is still alive the instant he is placed there. He might yell, scream, bang on the wall, and so on. For the time being he is alive until he runs out of air, or, if the box is big enough, dehydrates and dies. These are the obvious \"macro\" signs we associate with life. But that's not what we mean when we say that \"cells\" are alive or that \"viruses\" aren't.\n\nFor the malaria it is no longer in a red-blood cell. However the instant I place it in the box it can still process the energy stores it made--just like the human. It still undergoes metabolism, creating new proteins, breaking down others, synthesizing lipids for its cell membrane and intracellular compartments. It still unwinds the DNA it contains, transcribes a template, and uses that to make a protein. It might even divide, depending on the state it was when it went into the box. [Edit: These are the \"micro\" or most fundamental signs of life we can ascribe to a cell.] Eventually, though, it will die just like the human.\n\nIn both of the above cases the human and the malaria still exhibit behaviors classically associated with life even after being placed into the box. They both invariably die, but the point here is that there are two distinct times for these organisms qualitatively.\n\n\nFinally, we get to the virus. Before placed it in the box it was doing nothing--just sitting there, inert. Viruses do this until they bump into a cell or the cell bumps into them. Here in this box it will never come into contact with a cell. It sits there forever, inert, just as before with no reprieve. There is no energy production or energy manipulation. There is no protein synthesis. There is only the vibrating of its atoms and the random movement of its molecules in their aqueous environment inside the core. The virus remains like this until it eventually degrades, the same way ultrapasteurized milk degrades. Not degraded by life, but by the fundamental protein, lipid, and nucleic acid bonds eventually just...breaking. It is the same degradation a rock undergoes being exposed to flowing rapids for eons. It is the same degradation that causes pigment over time to bleach. Entropy wins, as usual, but there was never a fight along the way. There was never, at any point, something that for the time being still fought for order.\n\nIn essence, the virus was already dead. Or, better stated, never alive to begin with. Viruses are parasites to the limit such that they no longer can be thought of as living. Or, coming from the other direction, they are extremely complicated and selfish genetic elements.\n\nThey are \"shadows of life\" and most likely derived from a living organism or reductively evolved themselves.\n\nEdit: Check out [this video](http://naturedocumentaries.org/3972/hidden-life-cell-bbc/) that's very layman friendly. It's a BBQ documentary about an hour long that covers the lifecycle of Adenovirus, in this case the common cold. You can really see how ancient viruses are based on the many defense mechanisms our cells and bodies have gained to fight them off. At times it's a bit dramatic and not quite \"accurate\" with how things work on that level (e.g. with some personification), but on the whole it's very educational and can really help illustrate the point I was making above with a specific viral example. The typo stays.\n\nEdit: As I implied a bit in the beginning this is not the only view of viruses out there. If you're really curious you can check out [Dr. Forterre's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837877/) writing on the matter. In this case, the 'virus' is not the discrete particles outside of a cell but rather the infected cell itself. It's quite an interesting and unique idea and the article itself talks at great length about the many exceptions that biology offers up in general and also specifically those many viral exceptions and edge cases.\n\nEdit3: Alternatively, if you would like to really see what this metabolism is like and see what we truly mean by describing these \"micro\" signs of life, check out this 8 minute video [by Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBmLsPeuv6k) that centers on the cellular activity of a white blood cell leaving a vein to fight an infection.

At the very base of the tree you have three types of (single celled) organisms; Bacteria, Archaea (together forming the Prokaryotes) and Eukaryotes.

So bacterial viruses cannot infect archaea or animals for instance, and vice versa. \n\nAs for their origin, viruses appear to be the replication mechanisms of cells that have somehow \"broken out\" of their original cells. Seeing as bacteria can exchange DNA amongst themselfs (without reproducing) or even take up DNA fragments floating around in their environment (a proces called lateral gene tranfer) it might not be hard to imagine still functional reproductive proteins from a dead cell being taken up \"hijacking\" the replication mechanisms of cells they come into contact with, eventually evolving into viruses.\n\nThis also explains the specificity of viruses, as viral proteins derived from bacteria are only compatible with the replication mechanisms of bacteria. The lack of viruses that can infect life forms across any of the three major branches may indicate that viruses have arisen after bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes split off from their common ancestor, so quite some time after the \"primordial soup\" state, although I can't remember much specifics about the time frame.\n\nFun fact: Out of the three major branches of the tree of life Archaea are the only ones that are never pathogenic (as far as we know now, but very little is known about Archaea).\n\nSource: Orians, G.

There were probably some form of viruses before cells were even a thing. But DNA-based viruses would probably not exist when life was still based on RNA. Viruses and 'classical life' most likely have a very long relationship with each other, and not a single event that separated them.\n\nLife is basically a very successful self-reproducing system. Sometime, it happen that a subset of that system is able to reproduce itself (and only himself, not the rest of the original system). It then begin to reproduce on its own, in the sense that it can reproduce itself many times while his host only does that once.\n\nThis kind of separation that is the birth of a virus probably happened many times. Retrovirus have information for RNA reverse transcriptase, the protein that converts the RNA information back into DNA. This whole protein doesn't make sense if the cells around the virus are not based on protein to function (as they were very early in life).\n\nAs an aside, the primordial soup is kind of a outdated view on early life.

I had a really interesting conversation with a redditor that knew much more than me about that, it was cool.\n\nThe primary question of scientists for the early days of life is how did we get to a working metabolic pathway. Today, all of life relies on enzymes to accelerate specifically certain reactions, in order to 'shape' molecules into a workable form. There is an assembly line to transform glucose into acetyl-CoA, that can be used for many purposes. But how did we get to this ?\n\nThe problem, compared to many classical questions in evolution, is that as long as the metabolic pathway isn't complete, it is completely useless. So there is no selective pressure, even quite the opposite, since wasting energy on an incomplete pathway accomplish nothing whatsoever.\n\nSo Horowitz proposed that early life evolved in a 'primordial soup', in which the complex molecules that are today associated with life. Meaning that the metabolic pathways evolved backward, working from already-built complex molecules and integrating less and less complex molecules with time. So the metabolic pathway is 'complete' from the very beginning, and it was just a question of integrating simpler molecules into it.\n\n*But* it raises the question of why the hell is there a soup of complex biomolecules coming from nowhere exactly ??! Without really explaining it, many told that early Earth was very hot, volcanic and energetic. That energy was enough to allow complex molecules to be created. That's why scientists have sought those molecules on asteroids, also. But in reality, there are many counter-arguments, like the fact that those molecules have a very short life-span, reaction time are *very slow* without enzymes, etc...\n\nMore and more, the dominant theory is shifting. The new idea is that early enzymes were not as selective as the one we now have. They were inefficient but could help several reactions. Like, an enzyme that can put a phosphor group on many kind of molecules instead of just one like today. And they progressively, through duplication and differentiation, became more and more selective (and faster with that).\n\nIt explains how selective pressure was able to take place, and it doesn't need complex molecules miraculously floating around despite their half-hour life expectancy. We can also trace back that process of \"duplication and differentiation\" of enzyme back in the tree of life quite a bit. Work has also been done on RNA-based enzymes before life came to adopt amino-acids as its favorite tool.\n\nIf you want something sexy to end this long comment filled with jargon, I can tell you that the *very tight* containment needed for those *slooooow* enzymes to create a proto-metabolism is thought to be micro-cracks in volcanic rocks. Proximity of volcano provides energy and somewhat complex molecules. The tiny cracks forces those molecules together and an collection of ribose folds in a way that favors the meeting of phosphor and ribose.

That fight against entropy is, I think, mostly what defines life as we think about it.

What does that mean in context of what you've said?\nThanks!", "id": "daqom5x"}, {"comment": "> what is the difference between what they call a \"live\" virus vs. one that is \"not live\"\n\nSo you can think of this as sort of like the difference between a \"live\" bomb and one that isn't.\n\nOur bodies recognize (by shape) particular features of pathogens. In the case of the flu (my favorite) you have the H and the N proteins that protrude from the virus particle. These, as the most prominent protrusions from the surface, are invariably the most commonly targeted parts of the virus by your immune system. They are also some of the most effective portions to target for a variety of reasons which aren't particularly relevant.\n\nWith that in mind, there are some complexities of the immune system at play here as well. Because we know which targets are effective and readily accepted by the body, we can simply grow up a lot of virus or even use recombinant cell lines that only produce the particular virus proteins in question. When we do this, we can avoid working with \"complete\" or \"live\" virus that is capable of infection. In this instance you can be given a \"subunit\" vaccine composed of only the H and N portions of the virus, incapable of replicating or causing you disease. You can however still have an immune response that itself can be quite severe, but you don't ever have the disease itself. There are downsides to this approach that are complex. One is that the subunit vaccine is injected into your muscle and gives rise to antibodies within your bloodstream but not your mucosal membranes which is what the flu would encounter first.\n\nBut, for several reasons it is still advantageous to use a \"live attenuated\" virus. This is a virus that has been chosen due to its closely related nature to a circulating virus and is then purposely made to be poor at replicating in a human host. For instance, this is the oral polio vaccine. You can grow the virus on monkey cells which are related but not identical to human cells. Eventually they become more adept at infecting monkey cells *but* this is at the expense of effective replication in human cells. The end result is a more \"authentic\" response to infection by your immune system that covers more bases, so to speak. There are downsides, such as the inability for immune compromised patients to receive such viruses and the potential for reversion mutations (very unlikely) in some unfortunate patients.", "id": "daqp9dg"}, {"comment": "Neat, thanks!", "id": "daqu31l"}, {"comment": "Thanks for this great explanation.

When we start to consider other obligate parasites, this definition becomes problematic, as they may be reduced to such a high degree (both in terms of cellular machinery/function and genome size/organization) that they too begin to push the boundary of what we consider to be living based on the classical definition(s).", "id": "daqajv4"}, {"comment": "I was under the impression that our cells derive their energy from a part of the cell that used to be another cell altogether and has now become symbiotically attached to it.

Besides, mitochondria don't produce all the energy of a cell, they're only responsible for the largest contribution. Cells can derive energy from nutrients without mitochondria, glycolysis (the first, most basic step in metabolism, when sugar is broken down) doesn't require them. Red blood cells contain no mitochondria, so they get all their energy from anaerobic glycolysis, in order to not use up the oxygen they transport themselves.", "id": "dar3wjh"}], [{"comment": "There is actually no agreed upon definition of life in Biology, see the [wikipage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life#Biology) for this. However, when people are talking about how a virus is not considered life, they usually come with their Biology textbook definition of life, which is sort of as followed; \n\nLife should contain at least most of the following characteristics; \n\n- homeostasis; [hard to ELI5] cells should be able to maintain a different environment than the outside environment \n- Organization; more or less that it should look like how we know life looks like, consisting of cell(s), DNA/RNA [a weak point to be honest]\n- Metabolism; produce energy for itself either by eating or sunlight and using this energy.\n- Growth; producing more energy than using it\n- Respons to stimuli; react to something, say a human to a red light\n- Reproduction; the ability to create 'children' or copies (as microbes do) \n\nIn general it is said that all these traits should be within the organism to be able to call it life. So because a virus does not have its own metabolism and it cannot reproduce without help of a host it is sometimes considered to be not life. Biologists are - I think - kind of split on the matter. Still Virology is a subject within Biology. Also this is not the only problem with the definition above. There are some people that argue that for example fire contains most of the traits above (except for the organization). So a relatively new idea is to go with a new definition of life; life is able to undergo evolution. \n\nNow in my opinion this is the strongest definition of life. Evolution is seen in everything that is living and not in lifeless objects. One of the consequences of this theory is that the virus would thus actually be considered life, since it is undergoing evolution. Again, there is no agreement between biologists, but I see this becoming the new definition in the future, since (again my opinion) there is not really any argument against it, other than being too familiar with the previous definition. \n\n**tl:dr** It depends on who you ask, some say a virus is not living because it does not reproduce and create its own energy, others would say a virus is life because it evolves. \n\n**edit** Woops, see it has gotten a bit more of attention than I thought and some people are upset by my 'amateur' answer. I wanted to put it simple since; ELI5. You can agree or dissagree with the evolution notion, this happens within the field of Biology as well. For disclaimers, I am not an evolutionary biologist, although I did follow a lot of courses within the subject. Nor am I a micro-biologist, (some courses). The growth thing; yes I understand the confusion, I should have put; use energy for production of biomass (or have a surplus of energy used for biomass production). Honest mistake, but I'll leave it. \n\nAs for the evolution part; yes I mean evolution by means of natural selection. Again it is ELI5 .. Sorry if you think I was misleading people, I am not.

Salt brings out deeper and more subtle flavors, and makes things taste more like they are, so to speak. It intensifies, mellows, and deepens other flavors, long before it makes food taste \"salty\". This is what distinguishes it from, say, basil or orange-peel, as a seasoning.\n\n- Black pepper is only slightly less unique and versatile. Also a preservative (although much less potent than salt), black pepper contains piperine, which is one of the few fat-soluble chemicals with a significant flavor effect, which means it can \"soak into\" food as most other spices cannot. Similar to salt, it can bring out a subtle depth, richness, and intensity of flavor without imposing its own.\n\n\nIn short, most spices and seasonings are kind of \"added flavors\".

So being punctual is not ingrained to the agricultural community, and eventually everyone. You can wear same kind of shirts any given time of the year, you can do any activities at any given time of the year (in regards of weather). \"There's always tomorrow\" is prevailing mindset.  \n\nIn Canada, spring is only 1 month long, 2 if lucky. If you miss planting your crops during that month, crops won't have enough time to grow before winter strikes. This mentality also carried to all aspect of life now. If you want to go to the beach, you have 2 months of summer (or 3 if lucky) to do it. If you want to go ski trip you have 2-3 months to do it. If you become complacent and miss it, you're screwed.

The most recent system is called [Pinyin,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) and can read some more about the history of other systems [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese)\n\nOne of the reasons that some of the letters in Pinyin don't line up exactly with their English equivalents is that some of the sounds in the Chinese language don't exist in English, so we have to choose something which is close but not perfect. For example there is something which sounds a bit like the *ts* at the end of the word \"cats\" which doesn't have a separate letter in English, but is represented by a C in Pinyin.\n\nAnother reason is that English isn't the only language which uses the Roman alphabet. While it might not make much sense for you as an English speaker for the letter X to make a *sh* sound, it makes perfect sense to Spanish or Portuguese speakers.\n\nBecause of this it's probably better to think of Pinyin as having its own pronunciation rules that are easier to make out in English, rather than as a direct conversion from Chinese to English.\n\n_____________________\n\nAs for Worcester, the town has been around for a very long time. So long in fact that we don't know exactly when it was first inhabited, or much about the [Weorgoran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weorgoran) - the people who first lived there and gave their name to the settlement of Weorgoran Ceaster. \n\nOver the years the town and the rest of the country were inhabited by different groups of people, and language and pronunciation of things gradually changed. In Worcester's case, the sound in the middle of the word ended up being left out when people said the word. This happens quite a lot, and not only to place names, in a process called [Syncope.][Syncope]\n[Syncope]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(phonology)\n\nSo in short, it's pronounced that way because people have been saying it like that for a while, and everyone has got used to it being pronounced that way."], [3, "It is not really spelled in English, it is transliterated into the Latin alphabet, which is usually used to write modern English and a large number of other languages.\n\nThis may sound pedantic, but understanding the distinction is part of the answer to your problem.\n\nYou may speak English or French or Mandarin as the spoken language.\n\nEnglish is written using Latin characters. Other European Languages like French or Spanish or Italian are written with the same characters (and sometimes some added characters like \u00f6\u00e1\u00f1\u00df etc).\n\nThe characters may be the same in English or Italian, but that doesn't mean that a native English speaker can read a foreign language that is written in the language even though it uses familiar letters.\n\nSo far so good. And I have probably not told you anything you didn't know before.\n\nNow here comes the interesting part if you give some random European a text written in the Latin alphabet and ask them to read it out loud they will (absent any other context) pronounce the words quite differently. For example the name of the capital of France is written as \"Paris\" in a number of different languages but it is slightly differently in French than in English for example.\n\nSo what you consider to be \"spelled in English\" is actually written using a character-set that English speakers have no monopoly on and that doesn't really have a common agreed upon pronunciation among the different groups that use it to write down their language.\n\nAsk a German how the letter \"A\" is pronounced and the will make a different sound then an Englishman.\n\nNow there are other languages that use different writing systems. For example the name of the president or Russia is written as \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d in the Russian alphabet using Cyrillic characters. This is usually transliterated as Vladimir Putin. Or at least for english speaker it is. In Germany where they pronounces Vs and Ws differently they use a slightly different transliteration system and the \u0412 becomes a W and the given name comes out as Wladmir and the French write his last name as Poutine for the same reason.\n\nThe English and the Germans and the French use different systems to transliterate Russian names.\n\nThis is mostly because there has been lots of contact among the cultures for a really long time and everyone developed their own system that fits their own pronunciation of the letters best.\n\nWith other languages contact was later and less often and so for example for Japanese everyone basically uses the same transliteration system (actually there are several and there a different variants of the Hepburn that is the standards) So the name comes out more or less the same in Latin characters no matter which country you are in.\n\nWith some names you get so many different transliteration systems being used. For example the former Lybain ruler Mummar Gaddaffi spelled his name in Arabic \u0645\u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0630\u0627\u0641\u064a but because no standardized system exist how to transliterate Arabic into Latin characters (or maybe to many standards exist) that can comes out as anything (List taken from the straight dope):\n\n>(1) Muammar Qaddafi, (2) Mo'ammar Gadhafi, (3) Muammar Kaddafi, (4) Muammar Qadhafi, (5) Moammar El Kadhafi, (6) Muammar Gadafi, (7) Mu'ammar al-Qadafi, (8) Moamer El Kazzafi, (9) Moamar al-Gaddafi, (10) Mu'ammar Al Qathafi, (11) Muammar Al Qathafi, (12) Mo'ammar el-Gadhafi, (13) Moamar El Kadhafi, (14) Muammar al-Qadhafi, (15) Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, (16) Mu'ammar Qadafi, (17) Moamar Gaddafi, (18) Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi, (19) Muammar Khaddafi, (20) Muammar al-Khaddafi, (21) Mu'amar al-Kadafi, (22) Muammar Ghaddafy, (23) Muammar Ghadafi, (24) Muammar Ghaddafi, (25) Muamar Kaddafi, (26) Muammar Quathafi, (27) Muammar Gheddafi, (28) Muamar Al-Kaddafi, (29) Moammar Khadafy, (30) Moammar Qudhafi, (31) Mu'ammar al-Qaddafi, (32) Mulazim Awwal Mu'ammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Qadhafi.\n\nThere is no correct way or maybe they all are sort of correct.\n\nWith transliterating Chinese there is a standard, because the PRC made on. It is called Pinyin it was developed by Chinese and replaced earlier standard like Wade-Giles which were created by foreigners. The switch from one system to another is how the Chinese Capital \u5317\u4eac turned from Peking into Beijing.\n\nThe way the sounds are transliterated is not specifically meant to imitate how an English speaker would write down what they hear but is a mixture from several different languages. The way the letter \"Q\" is pronounced perhaps comes the closest to the way an Albanian would do it. It is used to write down a sound that an English speaker would write down as \"ch\" rather than \"q\".\n\nSo that should answer you initial question about why Qing is pronounced more like Ching and the whole Peking and Beijing thing.\n\nBut it actually gets a bit more complicated than that, because Chinese is not really a single language. You have Languages like Mandarin (which is spoken in Beijing) and Cantonese (which is spoken in Hong Kong), the two are as different from one another as French and English are if not more so. However they can be written with the same Chinese characters.\n\nWhere a Frenchmen and an Englishmen writing down the the same idea in their own languages using the same script will arrive at different results, A Mandarin speaker and a Cantonese speaker may come out with the same writing, because Chinese writing does not primarily encode sound but ideas.\n\nThe name of the Chinese capital \u5317\u4eac says nothing about how it is supposed to be spelled it is just the two characters for \"North\" and \"Capital\" for \"Northern Capital\" and the city of \u5357\u4eac means \"Southern Capital\" is today called Nanjing and used to be called Nanking under the old transliteration system that rendered Beijing as Peking. You can see that the charcter for capital is the same in both.\n\nAnother well known city with that character in it is \u6771\u4eac it uses the characters for East and Capital again. What would you guess that is pronounced and transliterated in English? Something with jing/king at the end?\n\nYou would think so, but  actually that is not a Chinese city at all but the way Japanese write the name of their Capital Tokyo. They borrowed the Chinese characters for their writing system but the language is completely different. The word for capital that comes out as \"jing\" when spoken by Chinese in Beijing comes out as kyo when spoken by Japanese as part of the names of cities like Tokyo or Kyoto.\n\nThe way spoken words their meaning and the way they are written down relate to one another can be extremely complicated.\n\nWhen one only ever has one language and mostly spells words the way they are pronounced except odd ones like Worcester, you usually don't realize how many levels there may be between words meaning and the characters we use to write them down as, but it can get really, really complicated.\n\nIt doesn't help that languages constantly evolve and borrow from one another, making a real mess of things that should in theory be really easy."], [1, "Because they're not English words... English is already pretty lax on following rules for how words are pronounced - of course foreign words won't follow even those loose rules."], [4, "Languages based on Latin use the same alphabet and the same basic array of sounds. Others do not, and use entirely different sounds. Chinese dialects use a variety of sounds which simply do not exist in European dialects and cannot be spelled with the Roman alphabet. We assign letters to those sounds, but they aren't the same sounds those letters make in our languages.\n\nAs to 'cestor', it appears commonly throughout placenames in England and is always pronounced 'Ester'. Leicester is Lester, Gloucester is Gloster, and so on. There's no real reason for it other than Britons being lazy with pronunciation in the middle ages, the same reason we stopped pronouncing half the letters in knight.\n\nFree Bonus: You're actually living in the middle of a linguistic shift in how a word is pronounced, the cot/caught divide. Half of people you know and most people under 40 pronounce those two words identically. The other half and most people over 40 pronounce them distinctly. Languages shift subtly but inexorably, and Cester has undergone a dozen or so transformations to arrive at what we see today."], [3, "Two reasons:\n\n1) Chinese is really a large family of dialects held together by a common writing system. When the first Europeans came to China, they almost did business exclusively with people from the South and learned Southern Chinese names for things. So it would be like going to France and calling all of their cities by their Portuguese name.\n\n2) The most popular system for writing Chinese with the Latin alphabet was made by the Chinese and they didn't have as a goal trying to make a one to one match with English. "], [2, "The Chinese language simply has sounds that aren't present in English.   They came up with a system assigning Chinese sounds to specific letters of the Latin alphabet, and in some cases they just had to pick a best fit that wasn't quite right because there wasn't a perfect match available in English.  \n\n I had a four-week crash course in Mandarin.  No expert, but I had a *little* bit of formal instruction.\n\nWorcester's pronunciation just comes from a thousand years of people getting progressively sloppy with their pronunciation. Remember that British cities are centuries older than US cities. We haven't had nearly as much time for the language and pronunciations to evolve in the US.  British English was also influenced and altered by mass migrations from Germany and France over the past 1500 years."], [6, "Mainly because the pronunciations are somewhere between the multiple spellings. If you hear a native Chinese speaker say Beijing, you'll hear a subtle mixed 'p' / 'b' sound at the beginning, and a subtle mixed 'k' / 'j' sound at the second syllable.\n\nChinese isn't the only language to suffer this. For example, there are at least 112 ways to spell [Muammar Gaddafi's name](http://www.westword.com/news/top-112-spellings-of-moammar-gadhafi-or-gaddafi-or-qaddafi-or-kadafi-5875642)."], [1, "> Why is Qing pronounced Ching?\n\nWhy is \"cough\" pronounced /k\u0252f/ or /k\u0254f/?\n\n\"Peking\" is possibly how \u5317\u4eac was pronounced in Nanjing Mandarin when it was first romanised (written down in the Latin alphabet). In my experience, people who have learnt the word \"Peking\" pronounce it as [\u02c8pik\u026a\u014b], and not as \"Beijing\" \u2014 else that would be like memorising \"vin\" (French) but producing (orally) \"wine\".\n\nThe Mandarin pinyin system is actually quite regular, particularly when compared to just about the vast majority of English orthographies. What you mostly see though is Mandarin pinyin, which is just one of many languages written with Chinese characters. If you want to see one version of Cantonese romanisation, for example, look at the Hong Kong\u00a0MTR map, or most street names in Hong Kong. The sounds the romanisations represent are mostly nothing like how a Mandarin speaker would say the name \u2014\u00a0because they're different languages.\n\nAlso, if you look at romanised Chinese names, \"Ching\" actually occurs quite often, though I can't explain why \u2014\u00a0I can't say if it came about before or after Mandarin Pinyin, as it exists in its present standardised form."], [1, "[deleted]"]], [[{"comment": "There have been quite a few systems for representing Chinese in the alphabet which we use in English.

However they can be written with the same Chinese characters.\n\nWhere a Frenchmen and an Englishmen writing down the the same idea in their own languages using the same script will arrive at different results, A Mandarin speaker and a Cantonese speaker may come out with the same writing, because Chinese writing does not primarily encode sound but ideas.\n\nThe name of the Chinese capital \u5317\u4eac says nothing about how it is supposed to be spelled it is just the two characters for \"North\" and \"Capital\" for \"Northern Capital\" and the city of \u5357\u4eac means \"Southern Capital\" is today called Nanjing and used to be called Nanking under the old transliteration system that rendered Beijing as Peking. You can see that the charcter for capital is the same in both.\n\nAnother well known city with that character in it is \u6771\u4eac it uses the characters for East and Capital again. What would you guess that is pronounced and transliterated in English? Something with jing/king at the end?\n\nYou would think so, but  actually that is not a Chinese city at all but the way Japanese write the name of their Capital Tokyo. They borrowed the Chinese characters for their writing system but the language is completely different. The word for capital that comes out as \"jing\" when spoken by Chinese in Beijing comes out as kyo when spoken by Japanese as part of the names of cities like Tokyo or Kyoto.\n\nThe way spoken words their meaning and the way they are written down relate to one another can be extremely complicated.\n\nWhen one only ever has one language and mostly spells words the way they are pronounced except odd ones like Worcester, you usually don't realize how many levels there may be between words meaning and the characters we use to write them down as, but it can get really, really complicated.\n\nIt doesn't help that languages constantly evolve and borrow from one another, making a real mess of things that should in theory be really easy.", "id": "dar1kef"}], [{"comment": "Because they're not English words...

Others do not, and use entirely different sounds. Chinese dialects use a variety of sounds which simply do not exist in European dialects and cannot be spelled with the Roman alphabet. We assign letters to those sounds, but they aren't the same sounds those letters make in our languages.\n\nAs to 'cestor', it appears commonly throughout placenames in England and is always pronounced 'Ester'. Leicester is Lester, Gloucester is Gloster, and so on. There's no real reason for it other than Britons being lazy with pronunciation in the middle ages, the same reason we stopped pronouncing half the letters in knight.\n\nFree Bonus: You're actually living in the middle of a linguistic shift in how a word is pronounced, the cot/caught divide. Half of people you know and most people under 40 pronounce those two words identically. The other half and most people over 40 pronounce them distinctly. Languages shift subtly but inexorably, and Cester has undergone a dozen or so transformations to arrive at what we see today.", "id": "daqxv3s"}], [{"comment": "Two reasons:\n\n1) Chinese is really a large family of dialects held together by a common writing system. When the first Europeans came to China, they almost did business exclusively with people from the South and learned Southern Chinese names for things. So it would be like going to France and calling all of their cities by their Portuguese name.\n\n2) The most popular system for writing Chinese with the Latin alphabet was made by the Chinese and they didn't have as a goal trying to make a one to one match with English. ", "id": "daqxody"}], [{"comment": "The Chinese language simply has sounds that aren't present in English.   They came up with a system assigning Chinese sounds to specific letters of the Latin alphabet, and in some cases they just had to pick a best fit that wasn't quite right because there wasn't a perfect match available in English.  \n\n I had a four-week crash course in Mandarin.  No expert, but I had a *little* bit of formal instruction.\n\nWorcester's pronunciation just comes from a thousand years of people getting progressively sloppy with their pronunciation. Remember that British cities are centuries older than US cities. We haven't had nearly as much time for the language and pronunciations to evolve in the US.  British English was also influenced and altered by mass migrations from Germany and France over the past 1500 years.", "id": "daqy7eo"}], [{"comment": "Mainly because the pronunciations are somewhere between the multiple spellings. If you hear a native Chinese speaker say Beijing, you'll hear a subtle mixed 'p' / 'b' sound at the beginning, and a subtle mixed 'k' / 'j' sound at the second syllable.\n\nChinese isn't the only language to suffer this. For example, there are at least 112 ways to spell [Muammar Gaddafi's name](http://www.westword.com/news/top-112-spellings-of-moammar-gadhafi-or-gaddafi-or-qaddafi-or-kadafi-5875642).", "id": "daqwwbs"}], [{"comment": "> Why is Qing pronounced Ching?\n\nWhy is \"cough\" pronounced /k\u0252f/ or /k\u0254f/?\n\n\"Peking\" is possibly how \u5317\u4eac was pronounced in Nanjing Mandarin when it was first romanised (written down in the Latin alphabet). In my experience, people who have learnt the word \"Peking\" pronounce it as [\u02c8pik\u026a\u014b], and not as \"Beijing\" \u2014 else that would be like memorising \"vin\" (French) but producing (orally) \"wine\".\n\nThe Mandarin pinyin system is actually quite regular, particularly when compared to just about the vast majority of English orthographies. What you mostly see though is Mandarin pinyin, which is just one of many languages written with Chinese characters. If you want to see one version of Cantonese romanisation, for example, look at the Hong Kong\u00a0MTR map, or most street names in Hong Kong. The sounds the romanisations represent are mostly nothing like how a Mandarin speaker would say the name \u2014\u00a0because they're different languages.\n\nAlso, if you look at romanised Chinese names, \"Ching\" actually occurs quite often, though I can't explain why \u2014\u00a0I can't say if it came about before or after Mandarin Pinyin, as it exists in its present standardised form.", "id": "dar42b1"}], [{"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "daqw23i"}]]], "5gc5vv": ["ELI5: Why do women look different than men?", "2016-12-04 01:29:38", 16, "https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5gc5vv/eli5_why_do_women_look_different_than_men/", [[8, "No, not really.\n\nGenetic diversity is a big deal evolutionary-wise.

Labor force is defined as those with jobs or those who have looked for work within past 30 days.

There are also numbers that look at underemployment -- those who work part time but want full time.

Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached, have given a job-market related reason for not currently looking for work. Persons employed part time for economic reasons are those who want and are available for full-time work but have had to settle for a part-time schedule.\n\n---\n\nNow, the figure most commonly cited as the \u201cunemployment rate\u201d is U3. When the government or media says that the \u201cunemployment rate\u201d is 4.7%, they mean U3. Of course, the other figures aren't hidden away; the BLS reports them regularly, but you can't blame the popular media for picking the most prominent number to focus on.\n\nWhy U3? It generally corresponds to people's intuitions, without having to figure out who is a \u201cdiscouraged worker\u201d or \u201cmarginally attached\u201d. It can be computed easily and accurately. U3 is also compatible with the [International Labor Organization's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization) definition, which allows it to be compared across countries.\n\nAnyway, all the time you hear the claim that 1) the \u201creal\u201d unemployment rate is higher than the reported rate, and 2) this is a cover-up, and 3) we should be gravely concerned about the \u201ctrue\u201d rate. (1) is nonsense; there simply isn't one true measurement. There will always be other ways of measuring unemployment that are higher or lower. (2) is just politics; all of these rates are regularly released to anyone who cares to look, and choosing one standardized rate as a representative is only reasonable. (3) is generally illiterate. We're all used to hearing U3 figures, and we've calibrated our own expectations accordingly. When someone says that the \u201creal\u201d unemployment rate is, say, 9.3% ([U6, Nov 2016](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm)), that sounds high because we're comparing it to our expectations of U3. But, of course, you have to compare U6 to historical values of U6.\n\nA lot of the time the person who brings up the U6 rate wants you to instead compare it to U3 so that it seems like unemployment has increased \u2014 or, at least, not decreased as much as the government claims. There's nothing wrong with bringing in multiple measures of unemployment as long as everyone is clear on it and we're comparing apples to apples."], [2, "Less people on unemployment doesn't mean they all found work, for a lot of them it just means their unemployment benefits ran out"], [2, "Unemployment only takes into account of those without jobs who are *actively* looking for employment. It does not include people who are out of the job market by choice (seniors, students, stay at home parents), or people who have given up looking for work because they could not find any. It also gives the same weight to part-time jobs as it does full-time. \n\nThere's a few other, more telling statistics when it comes to a country's job market health. \n\nThe underemployment rate measures those who are currently working in *part time or temporary* employment situations, and would like to but cannot find *full time work*. Full time permanent jobs are preferred because of their stability and generally higher rate of pay and benefits. People in stable economic situations are more likely to spend (especially on big ticket items), or invest their savings. Because they have higher earning power, they generate more tax revenue. They're also less reliant on government subsidies.  A low number means more stability among workers, a high number means greater instability.\n\nThe second number is the labour participation rate. This is the percentage of the population as a whole who are *currently* working. Of course this number doesn't tell the whole picture, but you can weight it against other statistics to get a more accurate sense of the economy. Ideally, you want the LPR to be flat or growing. Meaning the economy is at least stable. A declining LPR can signal an uptick in retirement without workers to replace them, or a growing number of people who are unemployed or have given up looking for work. Since income tax still makes up a significant portion of government revenue, you want this rate kept high. \n\nThe third is youth unemployment. It measures people age 16-24 who are unemployed and *actively* looking for work. This number can be a warning sign for the future health of the economy. Youth need work to build skills and experience. If they cannot find it, career growth can stall or become delayed. They may also have less money to invest in things like higher education. \n\nIn the United States, the underemployment rate has been hovering between 10-14% this year though trends show a decline. The youth unemployment rate has been averaging about 10.5% and has been fairly flat over the last year. \n\nThe labour participation rate is 62.7%, which is the lowest it's been since the early 80's after peaking around 67% in the late 90's/early 2000's. The LPR remained fairly stable during the 90's and early 2000's, but saw a sharp declining trend starting with the Recession in 2008. It's only recently started to stabilize after reaching that 30 year low in 2015. \n\nAnother stat worth looking at is mean income. This is a good number to get a rough indication of quality of work. An increase in this number means an increase in better quality jobs, or an overall upward trend in wages.

You're right, those with fixed rate mortgages were largely unaffected by the housing market crash with the exception of loss of value. However, the housing market crash had other effects on the economy. The biggest problem comes from the the amount of bad loans that were written. People were getting loans for houses they couldn't afford and others were pulling money out of their homes by taking out 2nd mortgages on the increased value of their homes to buy stuff. Additionally, interest rates were pretty good, so a lot of people took out adjustable rate mortgages. \n\nSo the appeal of the mortgage backed securities is they've always been pretty  secure. Like you said, most people that buy a house want to just live there and pay back their loan; which makes them a pretty solid investment. Problem is, the banks were used to deriving additional debt off of these securities and many large retirement and other type funds were heavily invested into them and they had become riddled with bad debt (because it was being hidden, and purposely rated higher than it should have been). When the housing bubble popped, this happened in conjunction with, people started defaulting because they couldn't pay their mortgage or they just refused to pay for a house that was worth less than 60% of their mortgage. So these mbs started to become worthless causing sell off. In turn interest rates shot up driving more people with adjustable rate mortgages out of their homes leading to more defaulting and collapse.\n\nSo how does this translate to a recession? For starters, there's a lot of money, that was based off these securities, that was wiped away. Banks had a reliance on them, many retirement and other funds were largely invested in them. As a result, their disappearance collapsed banks, which were forced to be bailed out because banks are the ones that create or multiply money, they hold a majority of our money, and they provide a lot of jobs. No new homes were being built, so the construction industry pretty much disappeared, leaving many unemployed. Taking with it the industries that support construction and development. All in all leading to a surplus of labor and decrease in wages. People had less money to put back into the economy by buying new cars and other products thus leading to a recession. \n\nI know I missed a few things like money becoming harder to borrow and companies that operated with a lot of debt being forced to close down, but I think that pretty much covers the jist of it all. Also, the rest of the world invests a lot of money in the US economy because it's usually very stable, so when we collapse we take everyone down with us. "], [1, "Several different topics to unpack here. The first is the interest rate on your home. Typically, interest rates on homes are fixed rates, so they cannot be changed. However, variable rate and so called \"teaser rate\" mortgages became very popular before the last recession. In an effort to continue creating new mortgages, bank officers began offering these types of interest rates. \n\nThis is a double-edged sword of sorts. Variable interest rates are attractive to banks, because they allow for the investment to be adjusted and risk to be mitigated. More on this later. Teaser rates, a form of variable rates in which the interest rate starts off low, but then automatically increases down the road, are very attractive to less wealthy potential home buyers. They allow for low mortgage payments initially, and can be handled in the long term by refinancing after the homes value has risen.\n\nSo why would a bank want to raise interest rates on a mortgage. Interest on a loan is a way of quantifying how risky a loan is, and making up for it. Safe loans get low interest rates, while riskier loans get higher interest rates. A house is generally a pretty safe loan, so long as the house's value stays pretty close to the amount still owed on the loan. If the value increases, you refinance the house with a lower rate. If the value of the house falls, the bank wants a higher interest rate to compensate for the now much riskier loan.\n\nSo what caused the recession after housing prices fell? Too many home loans had teaser rates all set to \"expire\" around the same time, since so many of these loans had been signed so recently in the years before the crash. All of these teaser rates expiring led to people's payments doubling. Increasing a mortgage's interest rate by 2-3% has a massive effect on monthly payments. \n\nSo people began defaulting on their loans, which causes housing prices to begin to decline. This causes banks to take two actions. First, they begin increasing interest rates on the mortgages they could, while simultaneously slowing the number of new mortgages being offered. This one two punch leads to a lot of empty houses that can't be filled.

The classic example here is the stripper in New York that was able to buy 6 houses, and defaulted on all six simultaneously. \n\nWith a massive supply of vacant houses, and reduced demand for houses, the prices of all houses began to slide. After all, why buy a house from the family living there when the bank is auctioning off the house next door for pennies on the dollar.\n\nThese defaults and falling house prices make mortgage bundles a bad investment, causing the bank's to either eat the lost revenue or sell before things got worse. Wall Street begins losing money as everyone scrambles to slow their fall in the industry. This just drags everyone down, as so much of Wall Streets wealth was tied up in these mortgages and their derivatives.\n\nSo you've got a crisis on Main Street as people lose houses that were homes, retirement savings, or investments.

"]], [[{"comment": "So, I'm not 100% sure on it, but this is the way I understand it. You're right, those with fixed rate mortgages were largely unaffected by the housing market crash with the exception of loss of value. However, the housing market crash had other effects on the economy. The biggest problem comes from the the amount of bad loans that were written. People were getting loans for houses they couldn't afford and others were pulling money out of their homes by taking out 2nd mortgages on the increased value of their homes to buy stuff. Additionally, interest rates were pretty good, so a lot of people took out adjustable rate mortgages. \n\nSo the appeal of the mortgage backed securities is they've always been pretty  secure. Like you said, most people that buy a house want to just live there and pay back their loan; which makes them a pretty solid investment. Problem is, the banks were used to deriving additional debt off of these securities and many large retirement and other type funds were heavily invested into them and they had become riddled with bad debt (because it was being hidden, and purposely rated higher than it should have been). When the housing bubble popped, this happened in conjunction with, people started defaulting because they couldn't pay their mortgage or they just refused to pay for a house that was worth less than 60% of their mortgage. So these mbs started to become worthless causing sell off. In turn interest rates shot up driving more people with adjustable rate mortgages out of their homes leading to more defaulting and collapse.\n\nSo how does this translate to a recession? For starters, there's a lot of money, that was based off these securities, that was wiped away. Banks had a reliance on them, many retirement and other funds were largely invested in them. As a result, their disappearance collapsed banks, which were forced to be bailed out because banks are the ones that create or multiply money, they hold a majority of our money, and they provide a lot of jobs. No new homes were being built, so the construction industry pretty much disappeared, leaving many unemployed. Taking with it the industries that support construction and development. All in all leading to a surplus of labor and decrease in wages. People had less money to put back into the economy by buying new cars and other products thus leading to a recession. \n\nI know I missed a few things like money becoming harder to borrow and companies that operated with a lot of debt being forced to close down, but I think that pretty much covers the jist of it all. Also, the rest of the world invests a lot of money in the US economy because it's usually very stable, so when we collapse we take everyone down with us. ", "id": "daqsy92"}], [{"comment": "Several different topics to unpack here. The first is the interest rate on your home. Typically, interest rates on homes are fixed rates, so they cannot be changed. However, variable rate and so called \"teaser rate\" mortgages became very popular before the last recession. In an effort to continue creating new mortgages, bank officers began offering these types of interest rates. \n\nThis is a double-edged sword of sorts. Variable interest rates are attractive to banks, because they allow for the investment to be adjusted and risk to be mitigated. More on this later.

We've got knives and spears and things for that, and have for a _very_ long time.   \n\nFor humans, showing all the teeth doesn't mean showing off the weaponry, and that freed up the original smile to get exaggerated into a grin that wasn't considered threatening.", "id": "daqswu9"}], [{"comment": "Smiles likely evolved from fang flashing.

They may flash teeth, then hug.\n\nEvolutionarily speaking... humans evolved from something that was ape-like or what apes were during the time of our ancestors. We have to make assumptions about behaviors set against our understanding of those apes today that our ancestors could have been most like. It could be that we never did any fang flashing. Could be that we did it all the time. It could be that we are another chimp species. But showing teeth seems in higher order apes to be an appeasement strategy.

The IT industry knew this would be a problem, and spent billions to fix it.

In actuality, Y2K failures occurred over decades.  The first one was observed in the late 1960s with mortgage software.  I personally encountered my first one in 1995 with a tape archive software that had a 5 year retention period.  There wasn't this single big bang, but a series of problems that occurred over years.\n\nFinally, the dirty little secret about computers is that they fail.  A lot.  I've see it fail in hospitals, banks, airports, even nuclear power plants.  The industry is used to this, and has backup procedures to deal with these kinds of outages.  Y2K held the potential for a lot of failures at once, but there were still failures we were used to dealing with.\n\nThere seems to be this revisionist notion among younger people that Y2K was some sort of \"the sky is falling\" panic, much ado about nothing.

It's not like airplanes would fall from the sky or anything like that, but it could have been quite inconvenient.\n\nSince you ask what was the deal, I'll make the assumption you don't know what it was.\n\nThe way old (non-unix) operating systems worked as far as date/time is that the year in the date was a 2 digit number that they added \"19\" to the front of (this is rooted in the past where to save 2 bytes was meaningful).  So what would happen in a system like this is that the clock would go from 11:59:59 on Dec 31, 1999 to 12:00:00 Jan 1, 1900.  It wouldn't go to 2000, because it only knew to tick up from 99 to 00.\n\nBack to the original point, you could conceivably have important things like the stock market record information incorrectly, or something on a timer could potentially not work.\n\nIt was good to get it updated though.  Anyone with a 386 or 486 processor was upgraded to a pentium and that fixed the issue.  I had a sweet temp job in 1999 replacing PC's in big companies for the \"impending doom.\"\n\nLinux operating systems will have this same problem in 21 years.  They mark their time as a 32 bit number.  The number of seconds that have passed since January 1, 1970.

Y2K paid for my house.\n\nThe \"panic\" part was largely overblown, also, few people truly panicked.  But there were very legitimate concerns behind the panic.\n\nNothing serious happened on January 1st 2000, for three main reasons.\n\nFirst, people realized the issue ahead of time, and there was a massive, concerted effort to fix the problem.  The IT industry knew this would be a problem, and spent billions to fix it.  It is a rare example of humanity understanding and getting ahead of a problem before it became a problem (I'm looking at you, climate change).\n\nSecond, many people were under the impression that Y2K problems would emerge at the stroke of midnight on 1/1/2000.  In actuality, Y2K failures occurred over decades.  The first one was observed in the late 1960s with mortgage software.  I personally encountered my first one in 1995 with a tape archive software that had a 5 year retention period.  There wasn't this single big bang, but a series of problems that occurred over years.\n\nFinally, the dirty little secret about computers is that they fail.  A lot.  I've see it fail in hospitals, banks, airports, even nuclear power plants.  The industry is used to this, and has backup procedures to deal with these kinds of outages.  Y2K held the potential for a lot of failures at once, but there were still failures we were used to dealing with.\n\nThere seems to be this revisionist notion among younger people that Y2K was some sort of \"the sky is falling\" panic, much ado about nothing.  That, frankly, is an ignorant, borderline offensive misconception.

Very few facilities existed for unit testing so it was a risky proposition.\n\nHe tackled the problem in the late 80s.
