He had been involved in a war with Henry V the Holy Roman emperor, and even his predecessors had been at war with Henry's predecessors. Urban was losing and was being threatened, so he called the Crusades. This was an incredibly effective move, as most of Henry's supporters left him. Godfrey of Bouillon was one Henry's most fervent supporters and later became the knights of Jerusalem. \n\nSome argue that it was entirely due to Muslim aggression and that it was because of their violence that the Crusades happened. This is a pretty weak argument. There was no one unified Islamic force, as some like to claim. They were split into different kingdoms themselves and succession was often very messy. They didn't pose much of a threat to the byzantine empire, as they were too torn by internal conflicts. That did change though.\n\nThe byzantine emperor Alexius Comnenus did ask urban fir assistance, but this was several years before Urban called for  the Crusades. Alexius called for it as he had recently became emperor after overthrowing the previous emperor who overthrew the previous one. This infighting had severely weakened them. Ironically, it was not the Muslims who took advantage of this, but their own fellow Christians. Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemond of Taranto, later a crusader, actually invaded the byzantine empire and captured land. Bohemond even continued to attack Alexius after he became prince of Antioch. \n\nThe invasion by the Moors in Spain is often used as another reason as to why the Crusades were called. However, at when the Crusades were called, the Moors were being pushed back and their kingdom in Spain had recently been split up into smaller ones due to infighting. Moreover, if the Crusades happened due to Moorish actions in Spain, why wasn't the Crusade called to help them.\n\nThe argument used for this is that Jerusalem held greater importance and that Christians and Jews were being persecuted. It's important to note that they did have this harder than Muslims, but this was not unusual. The religion in power always had greater benefits. The Christians who were being attacked were being attacked by bandits which always a concern. There was nothing new in this. The argument that it happened to help the jews is the weakest one I've heard, as the peoples Crusade was responsible for the Rhineland massacre often called the first holocaust.\n\nTaking all this into account, we can see that it wasn't really due to Muslim aggression. There was no increase in aggression, everything was the same as it was been. People of all religions and cultures tried to fuck each other over to gain more power. This was the reason why the Crusades happened. Urban was screwed and so he called or and saved his skin.\n\n Religion was used as a political tool to further his own position. Bohemond did the same. He could advance no further in Italy, so looked to the middle east. Zengi did the same. He took advantage of the chaos to advance his own lands. His son Nur ad-Din did the same as did Saladin. It was less a war of religion and more of a war between various different people who wished to use religion as an excuse to advance their own position.

Turns out this is former Senator Bob Kruger of Texas (Democrat), who was also the US Ambassador to Burundi during the time of the Rwandan genocide (Burundi neighbours Rwanda). Apparently Bob is well known in Rwanda (sort of a celeb like Paul) and told me that he is actually still a very good friend of Paul R.'s from back in the day (as per the movie, Paul truly does have large government + money connections around the continent and probably world-wide). He goes on to tell me about Paul, the genocide while he was in Burundi, and various other political details like meeting with the Clintons (he verifies Bill is unbelievably charming). It turns out Bob stays at this B&B many, many times each year and teaches a course on \"Heroes in History\" at Texas Tech across the street.\n\nFinally, he says that he has a friend coming in to speak to his class tomorrow, named Paul Rusesabagina. To top it off, he would be staying at our B&B. That night I watched Hotel Rwanda another 2x and did some research so I'd be at least a bit more versed on the history at breakfast. \n\nThe next morning they were both there, shooting the shit - Paul was admittedly a bit quiet and serious but he spoke about the genocide and the hotel and all of this. He told me that Don Cheadle shadowed him for 3 straight months, learning his speech patterns and all of his mannerisms (it seriously paid off, I couldn't believe how similar they were).\n\nHere's a picture of us! It doesn't look like they enjoyed taking the photo. Oh well, the conversation was a lot of fun.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/cdqMLvu\n\nedit: I totally forgot, but Paul claimed the movie Hotel Rwanda is very, very accurate to actual events. It turns out that some of the big studios only wanted the movie if they could fuck with the storyline, and he refused until a studio agreed that it would be done as accurately as possible.

If you want to complain about anyone's Middle East strategies it should be hers, because they were a *fucking disaster*. To complain about Trump because he said he wanted peace, is *ludicrous*. \n\nSaddam: Was not genocidal, so this is a non-starter. We invaded Iraq on false pretenses. Our government lied to us and the world in order to do it. \n\nGaddafi: Was not genocidal.

Yeah, Libya post-Gaddafi is a real knee-slapper. Good one, Hillary.\n\nWe're so used to America invading sovereign countries that we think it's normal. It's not. Imagine what would run through your head if Russia's military decided to invade America uninvited and tried to overthrow our government. Would that be acceptable? No, I assume?

The short answer is yes and no. \n\nNo in the sense that they *were* being treated as second-class citizens to the Northerners ever since our independence from the Brits. How? Well, for starters, the central government (which, until today, has always been controlled by the Northerners. Khartoum, the capital city, is even located wayyy up there) of Sudan has always objectively neglected the south. Their infrastucture was always terrible, poor education levels, hardly got any share of the oil that they produced...e.t.c. This is what led to the formation of the SPLM, an armed separatist movement that sought to gain independence from us. Add to all that the religious tension created by the Brits when they were implementing their 'divide and conquer' strategy on their colonies. After independence, they just handed to the central government that large chunk of sub-saharan Africa, with a christian majority, poorly educated population and told us to deal with it as one last funk you before they left. Naturally, a civil war broke out immediately between that separatist movement and our government. Add to all that 'we' were very racist to them during their stay here. God, I miss them. I loved them so much. I'm currently in Khartoum and I can hear them (some of them stayed behind after their independence) singing gospel songs from a close by church.\n\nOn the other hand, they shouldn't have gained independence *that* fast. Simply because they weren't ready yet. As I've told you earlier, a large chunk of their population are uneducated, they have extreme tribal feuds. One of, if not the hardest in the world. Their two main tribes (Dinka and Nueur) hate each other to death. Literally. Kind of like that whole Hutu and Tutsi conflict. So, what does that mean? You guessed it. You can't hand over ALL of South Sudan to a leader belonging to one of these tribes, but  that's exaclty what happened. Thanks, Obama. Atleast when they were under the effective control of the Sudanese government, a tribe could sleep well at night knowing that their rival doesn't have access to more power than it.\n\nThe solution was to have large awareness campaigns throughout the South before their independence, for a safe transition of power. In addition to letting them pick their own head-of-state. A very *very* neutral person, with a shared lineage with more than one tribe.\n\nWhat am I doing here, analysing the nature of the armed conflict in the South, when even my side is going to shit. Any way, I hope they remain safe. I love them so much. I remember them from the pre-independence days. They were the sweetest people, and they deserve all the best. Most of their population only care about tending to their cows. Am fairly convinced that my government is playing a part in this, afterall, they are committing a genocide in many parts of the North. If I manage to over-throw my corrupt government when I graduate, I'll make sure to ask them to return to us. But I seriously doubt that, given all the suffering we've caused them over the years.

Primarily because adopting and using the technology that makes being in London unnecessary lags its availability.\n\nSecondary because, when companies do move out they find the staff don't - and then finding quality staff is much more difficult.\n\nPeople are dumb cunts on a very simplistic level they'll look at the salary and forget all the costs and downsides. i.e If London offered someone \u00a350k and it was \u00a325k somewhere else, many would think the \u00a350k was not just getting paid more, but it was twice as much.\n\nThey'll also think if they commute in from outside they are getting a London salary to spend outside London and be willing to put up with the pain of commuting to that end.\n\nAlthough, there is that thing where if you're based there or thereabouts there might be 50 jobs and outside you've got that one company that moved out. Lose that job and then what?\n\nAn example, I did contracts for computer programming, not in London but mostly around the M4 corridor, Reading, Slough etc. And there were tons. If one contract ended or I got bored then I'd walk into another 5 mins away in a couple of days. I originally lived in the Midlands and there was practically none - the odd contract popped up.\n\nStands to reason at the time I was based in the South East. If your company moved out they weren't going to get me. But, you know, quite a few saw contracts in London as worth more. I'd see permanent staff I worked along side, quit their job, get a contract, lease a sports car and started behaving like they were millionaires because they were earning \u00a325k a year one day and \u00a31.5-2k a week the next with their contract in the city. Because they didn't do the math.\n\nAt that point you're earning more for taking a shit at work than the minimum wage, so you don't baulk at a few quid for a parking space. This was one of the issues they had a few decades ago with parking tickets - people simply didn't care and would just park where they wanted to and paid them - they had to start clamping and towing to enforce parking.\n\nLastly people don't really give a shit about the poor.

Religion is fucking cancer and that goes especially for Islam, and anyone wants to wash over all the terrible shit it is responsible for in the name of tolerance should be ashamed of themselves. Fuck religious tolerance, humanism is more important and religion is nothing but an obstacle. Anyone that claims to fight for tolerance but has no issues with Islam of all things, one of the most conservative and intolerant ideologies on the planet, is nothing but a hypocrite. How pathetic that people have been brainwashed so badly with this PC bullshit that they have actually bought this idea that Islam is a mere victim of intolerance when really it has been one of the worst perpetrators for centuries. \n\nAnyone advocating for Islam is by association advocating AGAINST having a society that is more accepting towards the equal treatment of homosexuals and women. You literally cannot have it both ways with this sinister nonsense but it has tricked you into believing that you can. It really needs you to believe it's not as bad as it actually is to gain its intolerant foothold into liberal, progressive democratic societies, and it sadly seems to be succeeding all too easily.", "id": "daqi0t6"}, {"comment": "Within every religion, there is a constant tension between modernization - typically liberalization - and adherence to more conservative beliefs and behaviors.  \n\nBirth control, while considered by most secular people to be an important aspect of womens' health, has been fought tooth-and-nail for decades in countries where christianity is the dominant religion.  Many of the people who have fought most vigorously to move policy to support womens' health have also been Christian.\n\nThe issue with statements like the one you're making is that it pushes all Muslims, including those who would move their cultures to more secular policies, into a single group and then marginalizes them.   These are not religious matters.  These are cultural matters.\n\nIf you feel Islam is an intolerant religion, I really suggest you read the bible.  Good heavens, there are sections that are just page after page of God - the God of Jesus Christ - supposedly insisting that the Israelites slaughter town after town of \"others\".   It would be crazy, though, to suggest that all the Christians you know are intolerant, hate-based, zealots.  It would also be naive to think there aren't a great many Christians who fit that bill.\n\nWe should protect every woman, person, from persecution and oppression.

The new government, the Republic of China was founded under Sun Yat-sen and his Revolutionary Alliance (predecessor of Kuomingtang aka the Nationalist Party (KMT)) and sought to establish a constitutional democratic republic. However, in 1915, a warlord and politician who had aided Yat-sen, and had a pivotal role in forcing Emperor Pu Yi (the famous puppet emperor) to abdicate, Yuan Shikai, turned on the KMT and declared himself the new emperor. Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan and later founded the G/Kuomingtang (KMT/GMT). \n\nYuan Shikai meanwhile lost his power in 1916 due to widespread opposition and China devolved into a feudal state where territories were controlled by a mix of colonial powers and local Chinese warlords.\n\nOne year after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, Chiang Kai-shek took control of the KMT and began the Northern Expedition to subjugate the warlords and begin the goal of reunifying China as a one-party state and eventually succeeded doing so with notable exceptions such as Manchuria, which was occupied by the Japanese.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1921, the Communist Party of China (CCP) was founded as an insurgency chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao and began gaining power and influence among both the common people and within KMT's own ranks due to disillusionment with corruption, elitism, and brutality in the KMT bureaucracy, a trend that would continue to the end of the civil war and greatly empower the CCP. In addition, there was a perception that the KMT were more concerned with repelling the CCP than Japanese aggression. The often-referenced Long March occured around then, where the KMT began a huge military campaign against the CPC, forcing them to retreat to the mountain, and where less than 10% of the CCP army was cited to have survived.\n\nIn 1931, the Xi'an Incident occured, where the CPC convinces KMT official Zhang Xueliang to take Chiang Kai-Shek hostage and force him to agree with the CPC to initiate total war against the Japanese, independently and not without clashes in the process. The contribution of the KMT is considered notably higher than that of the CPC.\n\nIn 1945, the Japanese surrendered, marking the end of WWII in the Asia-Pacific Theater, and in 1946, a full civil war erupted between KMT and CCP. By 1949, the CCP had full control of the mainland and the KMT retreated to Formosa, now known as Taiwan, and established ROC there (and gave the natives the boot). At some point after modernization under a one-party system, the Republic of China (ROC) reformed into a democratic republic.\n\nFast forward, and you have the more pro-one china KMT party and pro-independence DPP.\n\nAnd that's the story of ROC in Taiwan and PRC in China (albeit less so) in the brief."], [321, "What's the harm in talking? Always good to talk to both your friends and enemies. "], [298, "As a Taiwanese I will explain the current situation to people who has little knowledge on us\n\nThe current Taiwan, which claims itself as the Republic of China (ROC), dates it s mindset way back to the Chinese civil war after the defeat of Japan, since the Chinese Communist Party defeated the KMT, which is the party backed by the US, which was beginning to imagine a redscare , thre party retreated to the Island, aiming to reclaim their legitimacy one day and treat the island as a temporal military base.\n\nHowever , as time goes by, the hype for Cold War died down and PRC kicked ROC out of the UN, the power balance became increasingly less favored to KMT and it became very apparent that it's basically impossible for Taiwan to change anything, their main political goal shift to economic and democratic reformation and building Taiwan as a soverign state which leads us into becoming one of the successful export oriented economy like Korea and Singapore and successfully transform from autocracy into democracy without civil war.\n\nBut instead of openly declared independence we choose to maintain an abstract relationship with mainland China, agreeing we are \"under one China, separate expression (\u4e00\u4e2d\u5404\u8868). That is because China has a strong belief that ethnicity and sovereignty are binded, Taiwan island is also in a position which blocks the naval expansion of China. By claiming we are still Chinese we claim a brothership with PRC and reduces the moral justification for them to carry out direct diplomatic punishment (e.g. military invasion). We're kind of like Finland and Soviet during the Cold War, only that Finland is more successful than us in dealing this.\n\nAnother reason is that the US also \"prefer\" we stay in status quo so that we don't disrupt their Pacific strategy. And made mundane promise that should we are invaded they will come and aid us or sell weapons to us since other nations are very unwilling to stick their dicks into such muddy condition, especially against China.\n\nBut it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain such status quo, not only because new born Taiwanese become less identified as Chinese, our dysfunctional democracy add up to this. We faced a similar position like the US which politicians say anything to win elections, so the major opposing party of KMT, which is DPP, created a paranoia that China is not to be trusted , leading to trade deals with them or industrial policies being halted or blocked in congress. Our stagnated economy and widen social class disparity then further fuel the populism, leading us to become more and more isolated and disadvantaged.\n\nTl;dr Taiwan and China are in a complicated relationship with the US in the party, we're supposed to improve the relationship with them but our democracy dragged us down"], [253, "Seriously, fuck China on this.

It doesn't truly capture the economic clout and might of China. That's something the USSR never really had, it was a hollow military power and one ultimately undone by it's lack of economic might. China is in many ways the exact opposite. A soon to be economic juggernaut unparalleled in human history (2050) that's a raising major world power. Currently in the global context China's might comes from it's economic influence not militarily. People of say Europe could care less about the Chinese military but do are impacted by it's economic largess. Also, keep in mind, the China of the future will be hell of a lot bigger than the China of today.\n\nPlus don't forgot if he did this as POTUS there will be consequences for the American business lobby. Expect random agriculture imports to be banned. The PRC doesn't answer to Chinese business lobby but the our government does answer to tour business lobby. Sheldon Adelestein the Vegas casino magnate that has tens of billions at stake in Macau is also the biggest donor to the Republican cause.\n\nUltimately our business lobby's greed and it's influence on power, our transparency, independent judiciary and checks and balances on government means you cant do to China what it can do to you. For example when US - China relations got rocky all the Walmarts in Chongqing got raided and shut down by the local government for \"mislabeling\" products. That wasn't coming from Beijing but merely the provincial government.\n\nAn example is Apple's CEO has the balls to basically say F U to Congress during a Senate hearing but they sucked the CCP dick by caving into Chinese pressure to redirect some of the profits their taking out of China back into it when they invested billions into Didi Chuxing.\n\nAlso, Hollywood doesn't answer to Congress but it answers to China. Most people have now noticed all the strange movie plots that involve China, Chinese product placements, Chinese actors with barely speaking roles. Which explains why Rogue One magically has not 1 but 2 Chinese actors. Our government doesn't have any creative control over Disneyland but China does. After much dick sucking Disneyland China became possible because Disney ceded all control to the provincial government. Disneyland Shanghai is the only one in the world where a local government has creative control over Disney.

The new government, the Republic of China was founded under Sun Yat-sen and his Revolutionary Alliance (predecessor of Kuomingtang aka the Nationalist Party (KMT)) and sought to establish a constitutional democratic republic. However, in 1915, a warlord and politician who had aided Yat-sen, and had a pivotal role in forcing Emperor Pu Yi (the famous puppet emperor) to abdicate, Yuan Shikai, turned on the KMT and declared himself the new emperor. Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan and later founded the G/Kuomingtang (KMT/GMT). \n\nYuan Shikai meanwhile lost his power in 1916 due to widespread opposition and China devolved into a feudal state where territories were controlled by a mix of colonial powers and local Chinese warlords.\n\nOne year after the death of Sun Yat-sen in 1925, Chiang Kai-shek took control of the KMT and began the Northern Expedition to subjugate the warlords and begin the goal of reunifying China as a one-party state and eventually succeeded doing so with notable exceptions such as Manchuria, which was occupied by the Japanese.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1921, the Communist Party of China (CCP) was founded as an insurgency chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao and began gaining power and influence among both the common people and within KMT's own ranks due to disillusionment with corruption, elitism, and brutality in the KMT bureaucracy, a trend that would continue to the end of the civil war and greatly empower the CCP. In addition, there was a perception that the KMT were more concerned with repelling the CCP than Japanese aggression. The often-referenced Long March occured around then, where the KMT began a huge military campaign against the CPC, forcing them to retreat to the mountain, and where less than 10% of the CCP army was cited to have survived.\n\nIn 1931, the Xi'an Incident occured, where the CPC convinces KMT official Zhang Xueliang to take Chiang Kai-Shek hostage and force him to agree with the CPC to initiate total war against the Japanese, independently and not without clashes in the process. The contribution of the KMT is considered notably higher than that of the CPC.\n\nIn 1945, the Japanese surrendered, marking the end of WWII in the Asia-Pacific Theater, and in 1946, a full civil war erupted between KMT and CCP. By 1949, the CCP had full control of the mainland and the KMT retreated to Formosa, now known as Taiwan, and established ROC there (and gave the natives the boot). At some point after modernization under a one-party system, the Republic of China (ROC) reformed into a democratic republic.\n\nFast forward, and you have the more pro-one china KMT party and pro-independence DPP.\n\nAnd that's the story of ROC in Taiwan and PRC in China (albeit less so) in the brief.", "id": "daqanvg"}], [{"comment": "What's the harm in talking?

By claiming we are still Chinese we claim a brothership with PRC and reduces the moral justification for them to carry out direct diplomatic punishment (e.g. military invasion). We're kind of like Finland and Soviet during the Cold War, only that Finland is more successful than us in dealing this.\n\nAnother reason is that the US also \"prefer\" we stay in status quo so that we don't disrupt their Pacific strategy. And made mundane promise that should we are invaded they will come and aid us or sell weapons to us since other nations are very unwilling to stick their dicks into such muddy condition, especially against China.\n\nBut it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain such status quo, not only because new born Taiwanese become less identified as Chinese, our dysfunctional democracy add up to this. We faced a similar position like the US which politicians say anything to win elections, so the major opposing party of KMT, which is DPP, created a paranoia that China is not to be trusted , leading to trade deals with them or industrial policies being halted or blocked in congress. Our stagnated economy and widen social class disparity then further fuel the populism, leading us to become more and more isolated and disadvantaged.\n\nTl;dr Taiwan and China are in a complicated relationship with the US in the party, we're supposed to improve the relationship with them but our democracy dragged us down", "id": "daqaijs"}, {"comment": "Our democracy is only 20 years old; it's relatively young but already recognised as one of the most successful democractic transitions in the world. \n\nI think you can ask anyone, Taiwanese or otherwise, that paranoia, or suspicion, of mainland Chinese is not a bad thing.

Southern conservatives generally seem to look down on service workers, because in their eyes the low wage unskilled workers are too lazy/dumb to get a \"real\" job and probably rely on \"government handouts.\" They do respect people who work with their hands and build/fix things, though, because of the whole Protestant work ethic thing. Factory workers, plumbers, electricians, construction contractors, landscapers, etc. It doesn't matter what their wages are, or to what extent those wages push them onto the welfare rolls, they're contributing to the world, and thus fall into the \"deserving\" category for whatever government benefits they may require to supplement their wages, stay healthy, and pay rent. If you're wearing overalls or an apron and look like you can lift a sledgehammer, you are held in high esteem by tea partiers. If, as such a person, you are also politically liberal and make your views known, they'll also be a lot less likely to dismiss you out of hand and tell you to stop reading the MSM. Home Depot and Lowes employees fall into this category because they prepare construction supplies, assist in landscape design, and know their way around a small engine. Well, some do anyway, most just stock shelves, but whether the employee actually works in any of the departments that do those things isn't particularly relevant, home improvement store uniform=respect.\n\nOf course, I don't believe any of that, I'm about as liberal as they come and personally believe that a business model that does not allow for paying employees enough to reasonably afford area food, rent, internet/phone, and transportation is an invalid business model that has no right to exist on my dime. Corporate welfare=bad, no exceptions. But the tea party hierarchy of deservedness is actually pretty interesting, it's not just white=good black=bad, or rich=good poor=bad, though plenty of racists and classists fly the gadsden flag and elect candidates to Congress. In their view, if you work a job that they perceive as an \"honest living,\" the government can help you along as much as necessary, because people like you are necessary to their romanticized vision of society, and must be kept around even if a living wage isn't possible.

How about owning up to the fact that unfettered, unregulated capitalism on the other end of the spectrum nearly led our economy and by extension the freaking global economy into the ditch (i.e. the Great Recession) during George W. Bush's second term? It was the conservatives in the age of Coolidge and Hoover who led the US economy into the ditch during the Great Depression, until the New Deal reforms of FDR put the nation onto the tracks of recovery. There's also a reason why George H. W. Bush only had one term in office and Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992: the economy was in a damn recession! Sound familiar? When Clinton left office in 2000 he handed over a budget surplus to the Bush administration, which, as conservative administrations always seem to do, wrecked the economy and provided us another lovely recession.\n\nIn my honest opinion the most optimal system is a mixed economy, one that is regulated fairly and also looks out for consumers. And for that matter, the Republican Party (i.e. the party of \"conservatives\") in the US isn't really for free markets. That's a bunch of horseshit. They're corporatists to the bone and do only the bidding of multinational corporations. Their best answer for keeping manufacturing jobs in the US is to severely lower the corporate taxes for those industries, which in turn means everyone else pays more taxes, because we're not about to privatize vital government services like infrastructure, maintaining the nation's highways and bridges, public schooling, fire and police departments, Medicare and social security for the elderly, etc. (although the Republicans might be dumb enough to shoot themselves in the foot on that last one and piss off their elderly voting base by scrapping FDR's legacy).

Nearly a hundred billion $ enter the country every years in exchange for the sales of Oil. Most of that money is stolen by corrupt officials in the Venezuela government (the entire chain of command is corrupt, from warehouse workers to dockers to ministries), resulting in none of that money reaching where it should. The top of the government being the most corrupt by far.\n\n- The internal currency, the bolivares i believe, is under their government's control. They're also obviously printing large amounts of it. Since internal spending is crashing however, that begets the question as to where is that money going to. The answer is also likely : Stolen by corrupt government officials.\n\n- The official exchange system (to trade $ and Bolivares) is also extremely corrupt and basically de facto steals 80+% of the money crossing it too.\n\nTherefore, if they fought corruption and put an end to the giant theft & general banditry, they might recover some modicum of control over their own economy and therefore country.\n\n> Who will drill for oil to become more poor?\n\n- The oil is pumped by VZ itself; henceforth they use no dollars for it. They don't rely on western companies anymore since basically 15 years.\n\n- A lot of VZ's reserves don't actually need digging. FFS a tar pit is litterally a lake of oil sitting in front of you that you can just put litterally in a barrel with a random bucket. You litterally cannot fail pumping it.\n\n- Most of it has actually incredible margins (80%+ even if we convert it all in the internal currency); but most of the money from the sale is, once again... you get it... stolen by third parties ! before reaching where it should.\n\n\nSo; the oil trade is actually bringing in plenty of money, but when you reach 99+% theft on your economy, it's just running into the ground to north korean levels. Even if you can find a litteral oil lake at your feet by walking 1km in a random direction in the jungle.", "id": "daqcsc1"}, {"comment": "there is no reason to drill in Venezuela anymore.

It is estimated there is upwards of 600\u00a0million\u00a0metric tones. ASU's school of earth and space exploration had a cubesat mission call Luna Hmap that will be measuring this more precisely.

With some well funded research this is not difficult to champion, but we would need facilities on the moon to do this\n\n**Asteroid Belt vs Moon Base**\nThe main advantage the Mon has is it's location. It is far enough away to be a challenge to reach but not so far that it's not protected by the Earth's magnetic field. One of the big challenges of a Mars mission is the environment between the planets. The lunar environment is subject to this for a few days of of every month as it dips out of earth's magnetic field. Now just strait going to the asteroid belt, this is just out of reach atm. We may be able to collect an asteroid or its resources but having a base 330,000,000 km away from earth isn't something we can do in part because of the same challenges keeping us from Mars.

As we start to capture asteroids and mine them a lunar orbit is the perfect place to do this. As we develop resource collection in space having an industrial hub for processing and storage off earth makes sense. We can further start manufacturing in space to reduce the cost of space structures. All in all a moon base is the future of industrialization of space. It will reduce the cost of launches and travel with lunar ice and the capture/process of ice asteroids. It will offer a hub to conduct critical research of space environment needed to continue pushing human civilization off earth.

Unfortunately, you have countries like China or entities like Elon Musk talking in grandiose terms about his plan for a moon or mars base but there are some gigantic factors inherit to such a plan that make it virtually impossible. It makes them all talk. \n\nI'm talking, of course, about radiation and the Sun. The sun could send off a solar flare, cooking the new mooninites in their suits (this actually [almost happened](http://www.sciencefocus.com/blog/how-apollo-astronauts-avoided-deadly-solar-flare) to the apollo astronauts). The radiation on the surface of mars is potentially lethal (though, there are some \"safer\" areas, protected by Mar's sporadic pockets of magnetism) but long term exposure is *certainly* lethal. People forget just how protected from the elements we are here on earth. The Moon and Mars are significantly less protected, or in many cases, not protected at all. It's one thing to do a single mission to and from those bodies, it's completely different to expect people to live there. \n\nThe amount of protection you need would require hundreds, if not thousands of space launches due to the weight. So that exponentially jacks up the price tag. Billions? No. That's how much it would cost for a single trip to mars. To build a small moon base, or a base on Mars we're talking **trillions**. It's simply cost prohibitive and that's why noone has done it yet and that's why this talk is extremely premature. It sounds like something that might be doable which is why it's so talked about on sites like reddit and in the news, but when you sit down and start figuring out the specifics, it immediately becomes apparent that you may as well start talking about building a warp drive or something equally as unlikely. \n\nI really hate to be cynical here as I'm normally a glass half full kind of guy, but I am also a realist. Dealing with the radiation was the biggest tell that the Mars One project was a scam -- they didn't have a plan for it.

Mars does have an atmosphere, extremely thin but thick enough that you have to deal with it when landing, and also thick enough for martian wind to kick up dust, speaking of which-\n\n2) Lunar and martian soil have different properties. As far as I know both pose problems when it comes to say, degrading fabric in space suits or causing issues if electronic cirtcuits are exposed to it, but there will likely be non-overlapping problems. \n\n3) Gravitational acceleration at the surface of the moon is 1.6m/s^2, while on mars it is 3.7m/s^2. This means that, given that the same materials will have vastly different weights, the most efficient use of materials from an engineering standpoint is going to be very different, and the presence of an atmosphere on mars also adds to this. Given how expensive it is to get a given quantity of material to the surface of both the moon and mars, this will matter a hell of a lot.\n\n4) The moon obviously has a very different length of 'day', but it's also a lot closer to the sun than mars is. This is yet another reason that the lack of atmosphere is important: each unit area on the moon is exposed to a much greater amount of solar radiation, and a much greater range of temperatures. This means that the materials used will have to have different tolerances when it comes to UV and thermal radiation, and the suits one would need to stay alive on the surface outside a habitat will have to have very different cooling capacities.\n\n5) Distance. In terms of logistical support, they have very little in common. It takes months to get a resupply craft to mars, but only a few days to get to the moon. Not only this, but the moon is essentially always the same distance from earth, but the distance to mars varies from 56 million km to 401 million km, and the average distance is 225 million km. This means that a moon colony can be resupplied or evacuated much more easily. On mars though, if you find yourself suddenly in need of resources, they're going to be a long way off. So long off that even sending messages back to earth will take anywhere from 4 minutes to 24 minutes, so skype calls are going to be off the table, while from the moon you could have a relatively normal, if somewhat annoying conversation.\n\nThere are many other differences between the two that make a colony on one not at all analogous to a colony to the other, but that's what I have for now.\n\nEdit: A word.", "id": "daqe8at"}, {"comment": "yes but, starting with the moon does offer insight into what needs to be considered when building a base.

When you're offered two choices and one is mental you choose the other.\n\nDisagree, personally I voted for AV not because I thought it a superior system (it gave the Labour party Harriet Harman FFS) but because I could see straight through what the government was doing and realised what the correct response was. \n\nBasically if you were in favour of electoral reform you had to view it as a step process. Give the bastards AV and watch them squeal. Within a few years they'll be offering us PR because they can't make AV work. If however you voted for FPTP despite wanting reform, then you've voted against yourself, and only have yourself to blame. The government were always going to interpret this as an endorsement for FPTP, and the whole debate will now be lost for about two generations at least. To think they were going to turn round and say 'OK, you rejected this idea, how about another one' were extremely naive. This was never going to happen\n\nThose people who fall into this category used to really annoy me actually, not least because they so often justified their decision by posturing about how smart they were in seeing through AV. \n\nAnyone can see the frailties in AV. It's not smart. It's bloody obvious. Precisely for this reason though we should have given it back to the political classes (whilst laughing at the same time) and say 'there you are, now make that work, and come back to me in a few years time after you realise you can't, and we'll talk again'.\n\nAnyone who therefore voted to reject AV and support FPTP played straight into George Osborne's hands. It's no wonder he was so smug in the aftermath. He'd put millions of people away. Hell, he probably thought he could win any referendum after this\n\nThe other thing to remember of course is that despite a temporary blip circa 2010, the natural alignment of the country was that rank and file Liberals (the voters rather than the elected party) tend to align more with Labour, and nationalist parties of Wales and Scotland than they do the Tories. Long term such an alliance under PR would make it very difficult for the conservatives and UKIP to form a government again.

I don't think that a return to 20th century Marxist classism is the answer considering its catastrophic track record, but the Left has to take off its blinders and take a more nuanced view of society.\n\nUnfortunately, both of the major political parties in the US are ruled by some combination of radical hardliners and Cold War fossils. Call out culture, combined with unprecedented levels of transparency, means that people must act in accordance to the fear and whims of whatever mob can shout the loudest and wield authority against those that displease them, which seems to favor extremist viewpoints across the political spectrum.\n\nTrump sucks, clearly, without a doubt, and is unlikely to help the people who voted for him, but Clinton was not a good candidate either. Clearly, because she didn't get elected, and quite honestly, it was more than a fair fight. Trump was the underdog in this battle, and he still won. One of the of repeated arguments I heard in favor of Clinton was \"Vote for her because she's better than Trump\", which is an incredibly weak argument. Trump is like, the worst guy, it is not exceptional to be better than Trump. Likewise, the Left is currently engaging in a lot of obstructionist sabre rattling, defending it with \"Well Republicans were obstructionist toward Obama.\" Since when did Republicans start setting the bar of ethical behavior for the Left!? The Left's engaged in a fantastic pissing match, and who cares if we end up with another 4 or 8 years of political gridlock? Great.\n\nIt's maddening to watch the Left do everything in its power to externalize blame over the election results. Could it have been that people didn't want to be ruled by us? Oh heavens no!

It's not the case at all.  They're sick of 'latte sipping elites' telling them what they're allowed to discuss and have legitimate fears off.  They're sick of the smug moral superiority that isn't always correct, but damn do they make it seem that way.  They're sick of being called racist, or sexist, or any number of things that they're not, because they don't align perfectly with certain beliefs people hold.\n\nIf you keep ignoring people's fears in the name of 'being morally correct' then they will no longer vote for you.

The Alliance (right/conservative/Cristian) won the election and ruled for 8 years. What they did was open the borders and tell people to \"open your hearts\", flooding the country with immigrants to get a cheap workforce and strain the social welfare. To compensate he decided to slash all welfare (and sick pay) while hiring out the immigrants as \"free Labour force so they get experience\" aka get modern slaves. \n\n\n\nThe left (Social Democrats) won the latest election and were faced with broken welfare, an economy in shambles and a rising unemployment rate. What they did was not raise the taxes, they decided to make it work despite the low taxation. They reinstated the welfare and has been improving on the economy by making sure people get related jobs (not fake ones), by making unemployed as well as immigrant work to get a  job or loose their welfare. Even enforce border controls and kick out those who don't need an asylum aka the economic immigrants. The result? \n\n\nThe lowest unemployment rate ever seen in the EU, doubly so among youths (from 20% to less then 5% in 2 years), BNP is high, export is strong, more slots at all universities for students, more money to teachers and schools, make sure decent cheap housing is built. However despite all that people still think the left is all about refugees and the right is all about the people, because either control the media (most big news papers and all alternative ones). Repeat a lie enough and eventually people will \"know\" it's true, even if the facts show the opposite. ", "id": "daqwvtk"}, {"comment": "However, it should be pointed out that the Alliance did change their standpoint early this year, and two of the smaller parties to the center are once again calling for the two to the right (moderates and christian democrats) to return to their former policy.\n\nThe left wing did not promise for the election to enforce these border controls, they were also strongly opposed to them. The only party that wanted them was the Sweden democrats (or the pariah party). What happened was that the refugee situation got worse, and due to changes in media reporting on the issue after the events both in Sweden and in Germany during New Years eve, it was finally \"socially acceptable\" and \"justifiable\" for the established parties to all together agree to **temporarily** implement the policy that the \"socially unacceptable\" Sweden democrats proposed, which was border controls.\n\nThe moderate party has recently stated that they were wrong previously in regards to migration policy*, and some of their representatives have stated that they wish that the current policy becomes the normal policy rather than a temporary solution, which is what had previously been agreed upon by the seven established parties. This means that some representatives of the moderate party have effectively changed the stance to the one that is held by the Sweden democrats. As for the Christian democrats, I have yet to see any stance from them (they are most likely staying quiet in order to save face, due to bad forecasts). The two smaller parties (edit: to the center) in the Alliance and the three established parties to the left (two of whom are currently ruling) have repeatedly stated that this is only a temporary solution.\n\nWe thus have a situation where the policy makers of Sweden went from being 87-13 against border controls, to being ~50-50 between temporary and permanent border controls, and all of this within the year of 2016.\n\n*Edit: My personal opinion is that this excuse is really lame. They have had 8 years to figure it out. When the same statement is made by the ruling parties I will find it equally lame. I am happy if I have graduated from University and moved abroad by 2018 so that I will not have to worry about that election.\n\nEdit 2: We know that a few people earn crazy amounts of money on the asylum industry, all payed for by the government. Specifically, this is the case when it comes to housing. For instance, Bert Karlsson, a Swedish businessman, owns a lot of property that he rents to the migration agency for refugees to use. While bribing politicians is illegal, it would not strike me as unexpected if it turns out property owners payed the media to be biased in favor of open borders and immigration. That would result in the media criticizing any party that goes against the established media, thus creating the situation during the 2014 election. When the events in Cologne, Germany during New Year's eve happened, it is likely that media took a gamble in reporting the events in order to once again go back to standard journalism agenda: Have the first scope on an event. This resulted in a lot of people investigating domestic events, and found that news had censored the events so as to not put refugee immigration into a negative light. Finally, journalist Sakine Madon has repeatedly for quite some time now reported on other journalists (claiming their rights to anonymity) admitting that their editorial boards are forcing them to either censor or not publish their articles in order to not promote other parties than the one that the newspaper is supporting. This leads us to the fact that since these events came into public knowledge, the parties seemingly had a lot more freedom to change their policies.

This joke ceases to be funny after hearing it all your life, and it's just borderline offensive at this point.

You apply them once a day and that's all there is to it.\n\nMarijuana does reduce interocular eye pressure. But in order for marijuana to be effective, you'd have to take it every 3-4 hours, to keep the reduced eye pressure. Obviously that's going to be a huge burden to keep up, not even Snoop Dogg smokes every 3-4 hours of his life. (And what happens when you're asleep?) Finally, smoking has many side effects that aren't good for your health, whereas the eye drops have just benign side effects like hair growth.

On helping Germans who are poor and struggling. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150427211644.htm\n\nIs an article saying that it is exaggerated. \n\nMaybe some of it is values, maybe Germany isn't supposed to be chalk full of people. Let's be honest the Economic policy of an always growing population is very dated and honestly bad. \n\nIf you take a population of Wolves on an island and see the population increase you will have a scarcity of resources. The same thing happens in human societies. Too many people in certain areas is a burden on resources.\n\n\nHere was a well written response describing German's Culture issues with it:\n\nGerman culture is not well situated for child-bearing.\n\nGermans, like the Danes, Icelanders, and Swedes postpone marriage until they are in their thirties. There really is a biological clock and it ticks for the Germans too. They just do not hear the ticking with any great urgency  Age at first marriage\nGermans are a nation of renters. Only 41% of all Germans own homes, second lowest only to Switzerland, and home ownership is often delayed well past child-bearing years  (Most Germans don\u2019t buy their homes, they rent. Here\u2019s why). That means that apartment dwellers who are faced with the prospect of more than one child are also faced with the need to upgrade to a larger living area. Renters tend to count their pennies as they are typically saving for that eventual home purchase. This does nothing to encourage couples to enter parenthood.\nGermany is a nation of perfectionists and perfectionists live in a world of high uncertainty avoidance  (Uncertainty Avoidance). That means that many Germans choose to avoid the high level of uncertainty and downright chaos that arrives with children. Germans are naturally comfortable with a structured existence; children are an interruption.\nGermany is an upper-class, economically-oriented nation and the usual trend is for such cultures to naturally gravitate towards lower fertility rates  (Fertility rate, total (births per woman)). The fact is that Germany's fertility rate of 1.4, though well below the replenishment rate of about 2.1, is not the lowest in the EU. In fact, countries like Greece, Portugal, and Spain rank below Germany. Outside of the former communist countries, very few countries are seeing any increases in fertility in this era of globalization.\n\nIn the end Germany has a fertility problem that importing people doesn't solve. Furthermore an ever increasing population isn't a good economic strategy nor is it good in the longterm.

That is what should happen as there are too many Humans on this earth and if the current number consumed as much resources as the Western World we would be in big trouble.

Just because a foreigner is rich and talented instead of poor doesn't necessarily mean they'll assimilate any better. Osama bin Laden was born to a billionaire and studied at a university.

Someone else will have those people working for them (we're not talking about creating humans, just moving them around), and generating GDP for them.

Psilocybin might save your life, and it may induce a panic attack that you spend years recovering from. For your average patient suffering from depression, it'll probably produce a powerful experience that doesn't create a lasting improvement in one's symptoms. It's worth noting that these were cancer patients, who we can assume were probably disproportionately experiencing depression as a result of their impending departure. Magic mushrooms might well be suited for a cohort of people whose depression's origin is primarily 'spiritual' in nature. \n\nBut depression is a catch-all word we use to describe a cluster of symptoms whose causes are systemic, opaque, and widely variable on a case-by-case basis. Zoloft and exercise in combination seem to be the best solution for me. Ayahuasca, psilocybin, ECT, Wellbutrin, parnate-- none of those helped in the slightest. But they've certainly helped (and hurt) other people.\n\nTo speak of a 'key', especially in regard to a crude pharmacological intervention, is clickbait nonsense.

After all, this is compound that most countries list as an illegal substance.\n \nMedical research thus far has showed that psilocybin is almost entirely harmless to the human body. The negative effects are short term, and psilocybin has not been found to produce any lasting (negative) effects on the brain. The only people who should be weary of using it are the ones suffering from severe mental disorders, or people on medication. Also, it is impossible to overdose on psilocybin. Furthermore, psilocybin causes no physical addiction. More so, after ingesting it once, you will develop a tolerance that will last for almost a week. In other words, the chances of anyone \"abusing\" this substance are extremely low.\n\nOn the other hand, using psilocybin is almost certain to provide you with a once in a lifetime experience.

During these times the Earth experienced biodiversity, forest coverage and rich ecosystems that surpass even the best wildlands around today.\n\nLife on Earth will be fine, it will adapt and evolve.\n\nHumanity will need to adapt to the changing situation. Climate change is natural. We need to switch to things that eliminate our contribution to climate change that has exacerbated the change.\n\nPersonally, I believe in the 'golden triangle of technology' that Humanity should be moving to. This includes nuclear power, as renewables arent good enough, especially on their own. Nuclear power could provide all the power we could ever need in small packages instead of having to use vast amounts of space to produce less energy than a single reactor can provide.\n\nWe also need to move to 'vertical farming' aka hydroponics, which would massively reduce the amount of land and water humanity uses for food production (hydroponics could provide several times the amount of food traditional farming does whilst using less than 1% of the water and land) and allow most of our current agricultural land to be rebuilt as habitat again. This would massively help species and plantlife and help scrub the atmosphere. The only land we'd have to use for agriculture then would be for animal farming for the meat and dairy industries. Freeing up the safe land currently used for crops would also mean predator species would have far more space to roam and would not come into conflict with farmers (the main source of endangerment for predator species).\n\nLastly, I'd say we would also need to become independent of natural water sources (with the exception being the oceans) through the use of desalination, water recycling/purification. This would allow the aquifers, rivers, lakes etc to recover, massively reduce (if not eliminate) human impact on freshwater ecosystems and would mean humans could have water supplies completely independent of natural events (exceptions being earthquakes, tsunamis and other things not climate related that could damage infrastructure).", "id": "daqmpa7"}, {"comment": "Found myself saying \"I agree so much with this\" more than a few times while reading your comment.

So why not start now and make the transition more peaceful?\n\nNobody can blame you if you start slowly. Cut beef from your diet first. Try to eat less pork.

Even if they didn't do that during the day, and only moved a street away, this would still cause major complaint problems with other buisnessses.   Then comes the fact that Homeless people aren't the best at tidying up a space after they've been there.

River North has tons of the top clubs/bars/hotels in Chicago. That all started to pop up after Cabrini-Green got knocked down. Weed Street is a bit further northwest but it has a bunch of clubs/bars that are starting to thrive now that the gangs are out. Neighborhoods like Old Town and Near North Side and New City are coming up. I worked in a few of the bars in River North/Mag Mile... absolute tons of homeless people. The magnificent mile has hundreds of them. Fact is, it's better to be there than standing outside some fucking Mariano's/Whole Foods on the North Side hoping for a few nice people. Nah, there is a ton of foot traffic downtown. You'll see entire homeless families if you barhop. They don't really effect business though. They are just there. I worked at the Board of Trade, so that's in the loop and it's the same thing. Sometimes I'd buy them some food & coffee in the morning. They didn't really detract from the businessmen on their way to trade futures though. They are just there.\n\n[This is a soup kitchen in a very nice neighborhood](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Catholic+Charities/@41.894839,-87.6328687,18.58z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x880e2cb33997308b:0xe73fcb3f755e5990!2sThe+Godfrey+Hotel+Chicago!8m2!3d41.894585!4d-87.631962!3m4!1s0x0:0xa71517c68a51cbae!8m2!3d41.8952002!4d-87.6323196) \n\nThere's a line that wraps around the block, every day from like.. 2-4. It doesn't drive out business. The area is thriving at the moment. So I mean... it's not unheard of.

Matter of fact, if you look at the front of the building it has one of those [Homeless Jesus Statues.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_Jesus)\n\nThe real thing that prohibited growth in that entire area is Cabrini-Green. Those project homes allowed gangs to fester and grow. Crime hurts business because why would your customers go to a risky neighborhood for fuckin... steak or whatever. I think those yuppie'd ass neighborhoods would eat this concept up.\n\nEdit: Oh, and as far as them not being tidy as an entire people... lol, uh, I worked some hours at a halfway home.

There are shelters and a daily soup kitchen nearby, so there's tons of homeless that walk around sort of like we're in a zombie apocalypse. I usually walk to a nearby Banh mi place or the grocery store for lunch, and I walk past one of the soup kitchens.

Vegans have come to find the unnecessary suffering, killing, and exploitation of animals as morally wrong. And yet we live in a society and in a world where we are constantly bombarded it. We see the ones we love most participate in an unethical and horrifying system, we see advertisements tout exploitation daily, and we must live with it while trying our damn hardest to try to reduce our own impact on immoral and environmentally destructive industries. What we get for it is often ridicule and exclusion. And then we are once again reminded of how ingrained cruelty is in our culture that not even our money is exempt.

We speak out against a system of cruelty and exploitation of those who cannot speak out themselves.\n\nConsider this--imagine you lived in the antebellum American South and you were against slavery.

I figure slavery is a safe bet, and it's apt in that many abolitionists were going against the societal norm.) So as this anti-slavery southerner, how do you approach this? You've come to find the practice unethical yet all of your friends and family see nothing wrong with it. Everywhere you turn there are people who own slaves as if there's nothing wrong with it. You do your best to avoid your own impact on slavery. You don't own slaves yourself, you try to buy from sources that don't use slaves when you can. But turns out it's so systemic, so ingrained, that even the money you use was produced using slave labor. This is wrong and unnecessary. And yet when you say something about it, you are met with hostility. \"There are more important things to care about,\" you're told, \"you're really going to get upset because some money contains a little slave labor, get over yourself.\"\n\n"], [29, "Once again, Britons protesting the important things...polymer bank notes.

I'm sure your friend would also sign a petition to end the use of tallow in solder as well, which means she isn't being hypocritical.\n\nAs to your waste argument - the vegan believes the animal's suffering is what should be considered.  Eliminating the use of tallow causes less need and use for animal products, which in turn causes less animals to be born into suffering.  Whatever percentage of tallow is purely byproduct of other industries is irrelevant.  This just means that, if people stopped eating meat and still needed tallow, animals would still be killed.

It's a financial benefit for the tallow producer, who is almost someone that's doing something vegans would oppose.

A better phrasing would be that their guilt was already established in their minds and now they were trying to get them to say something they could pin on them.\n\nThis is a problem with how we consume media - we trade on outrage so the outrageous idea that there was a network of paedophile MPs and upper class toffs will always be read and remembered.  The corrective headlines that it was all a bunch of nonsense never are.\n\nHere in the UK we've got a double edged sword at the moment.  Paedo panic infected the nation a decade ago and now runs rampant.  This is great because victims are getting heard and historical cases aren't getting swept away as they used to.  This is not so great though that with any panic of this kind comes irrationality and evidence becomes less important than smell.\n\nI believe that we as a nation are on the forefront of discovering how deep and widespread paedophilia is and others will have their own large scandals in years to come.

No?", "id": "darb7yr"}, {"comment": "> Hmmm... So, I don't claim expertise here, but my understanding is that there are arguments to be made here. For example, didn't the US economy basically recover from the Great Depression because of war spending in WWII\n\nYes, as was in lines with Keynes thinking in terms of economics. There is no doubt that WWII military spending was the most important part of bringing the US out of the great depression. Keynes thoughts were that massive government spending *during a depression* could (and obviously did) put a bottom on the free spiral of the market, and even revive the economy as a whole. That spending could have been anything from infrastructure to warfare. It just so happens that it's much easier to get a country to spend the gigantic amounts needed on war, rather than domestic spending.\n\n>  which then went on to become a permanent -- and expanded -- state of affairs?\n\nNope. During WWII, military spending by GDP was at an astounding [40%](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/spending_chart_1900_2020USp_XXs2li111mcn_30f_20th_Century_Defense_Spending). As you can tell by the graph, it drastically decreased after the war was over. While it did stay around 10% during the hottest years of the cold war, it was most certainly not maintained, nor expanded upon post war.\n\n> How much of the US economy is predicated on its military securing access to resources abroad, even if it is not itself directly military in nature?\n\nNow that's a tricky question. The Petrodollar is most assuredly predicated on US military power (in terms of agreements to protect Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations). That said, it's not like the US really uses Middle Eastern oil anymore, considering about [16%](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=727&t=6) of its oil from the Gulf countries. That's more about the ability to print money and spread the effects around the globe. \n\nIf you *really* wanted to get general, you could say that because the US Navy is responsible for open trade routes and free trade, any material the US imports is reliant on the military. Then again, you could literally say that *about any other nation on Earth that engages in world trade*. \n\n> How much of the US economy is based on tech discoveries funded by the military (say, things like the internet and GPS...)?\n\nThat's a good question, but rather contrary to the spirit of the question I was replying to originally, Yes, discoveries made via military research do effect everyday life, but that in no way means the US economy is reliant on war to function. \n\nThere's no real way to calculate these things, because once you start going down the road of \"if the military wasn't researching this, and the money was spent elsewhere, certainly private groups would have come across xy or z\". \n\n> but the effects of military spending have an impact on a lot of other aspects of the economy, I'd think. No?\n\nSure, but once again, now you're at the what if intersection. If that money wasn't spent on the military, it would have gone somewhere else. It might very well have gone into private research groups that would have made the same discoveries, or slightly different ones, at possibly a faster (or slower) pace. \n\nOnce we start talking about \"what ifs\" like that, we might as well also start writing our own alternate history novels, because that's basically what we're speculating on.\n\n", "id": "darbslr"}, {"comment": "Well we gotta make a distinction between the economy and the specific interests of the defence industry.

They contract these things out, paying some market-determined rate for the beans. It's not too hard to imagine how this could go under the radar without being deliberately pursued by the corporation.\n\nIn a similar vein, if Nestle is responsible, why aren't local cafes also complicit in the slavery process for serving coffee made from those beans? Or the person drinking the coffee?", "id": "daoxerv"}, {"comment": "Thank you for responding to such an intellectually weak comment from the OP. The \"evil corporation\" narrative is really very tunnel-visioned, and very tired. The supply chain in products like coffee, cacao, and sugar cane, (and basically anything major crop of this sort) is extremely complex and hard to follow. The whole chain is made up of cooperatives, subcontractors, contractors, subcontractors to subcontractors, autonomous professionals, owners, leasers, temporary professionals, and and number of labor arrangements. You even have people that need to eat and sleep somewhere, so they themselves engage in indentured slavery in exchange for work, and it never ever makes the books. Agricultural supply chains are a complete rabbit hole. It's not as simple as simply knowing that the exporter certifies slave-free labor. \n\nWe are talking about agricultural industries, usually in remote areas of countries and with little infrastructure at all. The nature of the crops -fluctuations, unforseeable conditions and circumstances, market fluctuations, bad crops, unfavourable weather conditions, and so on- determines the need for flexible labor, thus the complexity and all of these permutations in relationships. This is the nature of agricultural work the world over. This is why most labor codes (I personally work with 17 different countries) have specific legislation relating to agricultural workers, and generally allow greater precariousness in terms of stability of employment than in other industries. Demands need to be met in a variety of ways with a maximum of flexibility to even make the average, small-time farmer's operation viable. The problem of slavery and abusive conditions starts right with the grower. Tracing absolutely all of the ways they meet their demand is near impossible.\n\nThere are mechanisms in place where a product cannot transit through the country if child or slave labor was present in the supply chain at any point. Such legislation was enacted in the U.S. in October 2015. So, to this example, today Nestle, Hersheys and even artisan chocolate makers have to attest that their product was at no point produced by slave labor, in order for the raw or finished product to even enter the U.S. Other countries have similar conditions, so when the raw or completed product is imported, there is a necessary declaration that this has not occurred. Most companies -small and large- will go and inspect the growers themselves as due diligence, but as you can see from the complexity of the supply chain, this is near impossible to completely ensure. At best, you request this same declaration from your exporter, and they request it from their supplier, but the harvesting demands themselves are met in so many different ways, that it is really impossible for any company to know 100% where their supply has come from. \n\nSo, it is certainly not to Nestle or any other corporation's advantage to knowingly use product supplied by slave labor. Furthermore, such legislation is an impetus for these companies to send out inspectors to prove that due diligence on labor conditions has been done in the chain. Not doing so could cause massive supply problems. \n\nSource: I do labor inspections of coffee and cacao plantations in Latin America. I am not paid by corporations to do this; I am a labor lawyer and I do it of my own volition as a side project of mine. Even for me, where I have no vested interest in \"getting the attestation signed\", it is very difficult to trace where the labor ultimately comes from. All agriculture has a degree of informality that starts with the grower. ", "id": "dap3332"}, {"comment": "They aren't evil. I work for such a large corporation.

For the first time, a unified political coalition will challenge Yahya Jammeh, Gambia\u2019s longtime dictator, only months after the most vigorous protest movement in the country\u2019s recent history.\n> \n> The upcoming election could usher in a new period in Gambia\u2019s political development, which so far has been marked by two distinct phases. The first period began in 1965 with Gambian independence and ended in 1994 with the overthrow of Dawda Jawara, the country\u2019s first popularly elected president. Over those three decades, Gambia\u2019s economy performed relatively well compared to its counterparts in West Africa, ranking third overall in GDP per capita in 1994; the country also became a popular tourist destination, earning the moniker the \u201cSmiling Coast of Africa.\u201d Jawara was widely applauded for advancing human rights and for his bold attempts to improve Gambia\u2019s economy. Thanks in part to his government\u2019s record, in 1989, the newly created African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (ACHPR) chose to establish its secretariat in Banjul, Gambia\u2019s capital. \n> \n> In the early 1990s, Jawara began to face growing internal criticism and calls for change\u2014in particular, for failing to curb corruption and provide basic services. Throughout the early 1990s, civil society groups, university students, and working Gambians took to the streets to express their discontent. Yet Gambia was hardly an outlier in a region that was experiencing a host of post-colonial troubles. \n> \n> **Gambia\u2019s situation took a dramatic turn for the worse in July 1994, when Jammeh, then a 29-year-old junior military officer, seized power in a bloodless coup.** (He had recently returned from a military training course in the United States.) **Under Jammeh\u2019s rule, which marks the second period in Gambia\u2019s independent political history, the country has earned a reputation as a human rights pariah due to the rampant killings, disappearances, and torture of journalists, activists, and members of the political opposition.** Gambia is now the only country in West Africa with a per-capita GDP that is lower today than it was in 1994, and it has the region\u2019s second-lowest per-capita GDP in the region overall. It\u2019s no wonder that Gambia\u2019s most notable export is its own citizens. **This year, they made up the fourth-largest group of migrant and refugee arrivals to Italy, despite the fact that Gambia has one of the smallest populations in Africa.** Perhaps in an attempt to shield himself and his regime from potential prosecution for their myriad crimes, Jammeh recently withdrew Gambia from the International Criminal Court. (The chief prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, is a Gambian citizen and was once a legal adviser to Jammeh.) As for the ACHPR, African observers have called for its relocation to a country with a better human rights record.\n> \n> \n> **Since 1994, Jammeh has systematically deprived ordinary citizens of their rights to free speech and has verbally lashed out against most segments of society, threatening, for instance, to \u201cslit the throats\u201d of gay men living in the country and vowing to \u201cbury\u201d the political opposition \u201cnine feet deep.\u201d** But Gambians are not the only targets of Jammeh\u2019s unhinged ire: in May, for instance,  **he told U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and Amnesty International to \u201cgo to hell\u201d after Ban and Amnesty voiced their concerns about the death of Solo Sandeng, an opposition youth leader who was arrested, beaten, and reportedly tortured to death while in state custody.**\n> \n> In the run-up to the December 1 election, Jammeh and his inner circle have ratcheted up their incendiary rhetoric, which has at times amounted to hate speech and incitement to violence. **In June, Jammeh labeled the country\u2019s nearly one million ethnic Mandinka \u201cvermin\u201d and went on to exclaim: \u201cI will kill you like ants, and nothing will come out of it.\u201d Soon afterward, Gambia\u2019s top diplomat at the United Nations was caught on tape endorsing the shooting of peaceful protesters.** And in the second week of November, the government arrested and detained incommunicado three Gambian journalists (one has since been released). \n> \n> **In recent months, however, there have been signs that Gambia\u2019s climate of fear is beginning to dissipate. In April, Gambians took to the streets in the most sustained act of public defiance against Jammeh since he seized power over two decades ago.** The authorities suppressed the burgeoning civic movement with characteristic brutality, arresting more than 90 opposition activists and handing down three-year jail sentences to 30 people, including the president of Gambia\u2019s main opposition party. The crackdown led to the deaths, apparently by torture, of at least two opposition party supporters held in state custody.\n> \n> Instead of withdrawing into their corners, **in October, Gambia\u2019s opposition united behind a single presidential candidate**, a businessman and former London security guard named **Adama Barrow.** \n>\n>**The impressive union backing Barrow includes most of Gambia\u2019s main opposition parties and has drawn the support of Isatou Touray, a prominent human rights activist** who has been at the forefront of efforts to achieve social change in the country for several decades.\n\n\n"], [112, "I'm in Senegal,  which surrounds the Gambia.

(The chief prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, is a Gambian citizen and was once a legal adviser to Jammeh.) As for the ACHPR, African observers have called for its relocation to a country with a better human rights record.\n> \n> \n> **Since 1994, Jammeh has systematically deprived ordinary citizens of their rights to free speech and has verbally lashed out against most segments of society, threatening, for instance, to \u201cslit the throats\u201d of gay men living in the country and vowing to \u201cbury\u201d the political opposition \u201cnine feet deep.\u201d** But Gambians are not the only targets of Jammeh\u2019s unhinged ire: in May, for instance,  **he told U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and Amnesty International to \u201cgo to hell\u201d after Ban and Amnesty voiced their concerns about the death of Solo Sandeng, an opposition youth leader who was arrested, beaten, and reportedly tortured to death while in state custody.**\n> \n> In the run-up to the December 1 election, Jammeh and his inner circle have ratcheted up their incendiary rhetoric, which has at times amounted to hate speech and incitement to violence. **In June, Jammeh labeled the country\u2019s nearly one million ethnic Mandinka \u201cvermin\u201d and went on to exclaim: \u201cI will kill you like ants, and nothing will come out of it.\u201d Soon afterward, Gambia\u2019s top diplomat at the United Nations was caught on tape endorsing the shooting of peaceful protesters.** And in the second week of November, the government arrested and detained incommunicado three Gambian journalists (one has since been released). \n> \n> **In recent months, however, there have been signs that Gambia\u2019s climate of fear is beginning to dissipate. In April, Gambians took to the streets in the most sustained act of public defiance against Jammeh since he seized power over two decades ago.** The authorities suppressed the burgeoning civic movement with characteristic brutality, arresting more than 90 opposition activists and handing down three-year jail sentences to 30 people, including the president of Gambia\u2019s main opposition party. The crackdown led to the deaths, apparently by torture, of at least two opposition party supporters held in state custody.\n> \n> Instead of withdrawing into their corners, **in October, Gambia\u2019s opposition united behind a single presidential candidate**, a businessman and former London security guard named **Adama Barrow.** \n>\n>**The impressive union backing Barrow includes most of Gambia\u2019s main opposition parties and has drawn the support of Isatou Touray, a prominent human rights activist** who has been at the forefront of efforts to achieve social change in the country for several decades.\n\n\n", "id": "dap3cr5"}, {"comment": "I love how a mall cop will now be running Gambia.

Yeah corporate \"free trade\"\n\n* The news media revealed that Bill Gates (Microsoft), Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Marc Zuckerberg (Facebook), Inkvar Komprad (Ik\u00e9a) and dozens of european and american billionaires paid little to no taxes in the last 10 years in Luxembourg tax scandal. \"Billionaire philantropists\" my fucking arse.

Despite intense pressure to support him, Hollande said absolutely NOTHING. \n\nWe wanted change. We got a soft neo-liberal. \n\n**The major candidates lefts are the following :**\n\n* **Francois Fillon** Former Prime Minister and professional politician for over 40 years. He has done literally nothing else. Part of the French Establishment. He is a hardcore neoliberal who promised to reduce labor rights and cut social services. He is a also a catholic social conservative. He is accused of bribery for taking money for votes while he was an MP. He made over 1 million euros in this bribery scandal. Permanent member of the Bilderberg group.\n\n\n* **Manuel Valls** Prime Minister of Hollande. Member of the socialist party and calls himself socialist but is despised by labor unions. He supports reducing tax rates and reducing labor rights to economically compete in globalization (which he supports by wanting ever lower tariffs and more trade deals). Big Business likes him.  He defines himself as a member of the third way, he says he wants to be the French Tony Blair/Bill Clinton. Member of the Bilderberg group. He recently called Marine Lepen a dangerous racist until a hidden video of him was published where he said there was *\"too many arabs, too many noirs, not enough whities, we need more whities around here\"*. \n\n* **Jean Luc Melenchon** Former school teacher. Politician for the last 20 years. Hardcore leftist. Wants to get rid of money in politics and create stronger rights for workers. He wants a much stronger environemental laws. Says he wants to give Edward Snowden french citizenship. He opposes free circulation of capital within the EU without EU-wide labor laws and EU-wide taxrates. He will likely clash with Luxembourg/Ireland/Netherlands over what he calls corporate prostitution. He says Bernie Sanders should have won but the capitalist establishment rigged the DNC primary for Hillary Clinton. He clashed with the media and called the mainstream media \"fucking scum\". \n\n* **Emmanuel Macron** Former Hollande economy minister and Former Investment Banker for Rotshchild, a major bank owned by the french branch of the Rotshchild family. Has never been elected anywhere. Manuel Valls and himself hate each others. Member of the Bilderberg group. He wants to run on his own without a political party. He promised \"radical change\" but has no program yet.  \n  \n* **Marine Lepen** Nationalist. She grew up in the small provincial bourgeoisie. She is absolutely despised by the entire french establishment and a large part of the global etablishment. Her party has been growing ever year for the last 20 years.  She promises a strong welfare state. She opposes mass immigration. Just like Melenchon, she opposes free trade if it leads to a race to the bottom in labor rights and taxations of capitalists. She supports tariffs on countries without strong labor rights or strong environemental laws. She is ready for a showdown with the EU. Her party is accused of being funded by Vladimir Putin.

Leaving the EU is after all what they're about. In the general election they polled about 7%. In the last European election it rose to a new high watermark never before seen (27%) albeit on a much smaller turnout. Some of that would have been protesters and mischievous trollers. Note that both figures are lower than what the FN polls in France\n\nI'd imagine you can safely assume the hard core leavers are between 10% and 20%. \n\nWhen ever 'reform' is polled it is the option that consistently out scores the others. It's a pretty safe sentiment to endorse since its specifically nebulous. Lots of people can sign up to it without any fear as no one really knows what it means. Indeed, you can probably apply 'reform' to any part of the EU throughout its history and be reasonably safe in the knowledge that you'd carry support for the aspiration. \n\nThe other major issue with 'reform' however concerns that the people whose agreement would be needed to enact it (the commission) are uniquely placed to block it and arguably dispossesed of any incentive to engage in substantive reform other than tinkering around the fringes. This is the disconnect between the people of Europe and the Eurocrats in Brussels. The Irish, Danes, Dutch, and French have all rejected EU overtures on things like Lisbon or a constitution before when they've been put to a vote. \n\nA big chunk of the Brexit vote however would have been 'soft' leavers who have frankly given up any hope that the mandarins of the EU are capable of reform. If however they lose another major player (and the last Pew Research I saw gave the EU a higher unfavorable rating in France than it did the UK) then yes, the EU is in a serious existential crisis. This would likely force the commission into making substantive concessions to the reform agenda, which I think would be enough for the UK to legitimately say that what they've voted to leave, is no longer on the table, and they wish to reserve their position to see what a new look EU appears like\n\nI should say it needn't be confined to France though.
