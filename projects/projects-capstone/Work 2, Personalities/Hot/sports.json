So the deal they got in 2014 confuses me a bit. I think the league lacks rivalrys, parity, and I dont see a lot of stellar defense. \n\n Look you're clearly an NBA fan as your username and general attitude towards the topic points out. I'm not saying you cant be, what I am saying is the league can be uninteresting to many because of these things and its annoying from my perspective because I have played and loved basketball my whole life. Whenever I tune in me and many others are turned off by the NBA product.", "id": "dam8g9f"}, {"comment": "Thanks for expanding on your initial comment. But I have to say I agree with you on parity, don't agree on rivalries, and certainly don't agree on defense. In fact, the stats don't agree with you on defense, either: let's take the 1986-1987 season, considered part of the \"golden era\" for many NBA fans, especially Celtics fans like myself. Let's look at points per 100 possessions, which is a good indicator of how easily a team (or league) can score when they have the ball.\n\n* League average of points per 100 possessions in '86-'87: **108.3**\n* League average of points per 100 possessions in '15-'16: **106.4**\n\nSo, as you can see, teams were able to put more points on the board, despite the huge shift toward 3-point shooting in recent years (today, 28.5% of all shots attempted are 3 pointers; in '86-'87, it was 5.3%, and those 80's teams shot over 5% worse from 3 than they do today). So, despite most teams having explicitly adopted game plans meant to maximize points per possession, that number has gone *down* league-wide.\n\nI'd say the only real explanation for these statistics lie in the increased defensive efforts. If defense was *worse*, like you claim, then we should be seeing a huge uptick in points per 100 possessions, especially given the rules adopted since the 80's making it easier for players to score.\n\nAs far as ratings go, that one is interesting, because when you look at ratings for all games, you're right, they are going down. However, this doesn't take in to account services like League Pass, which I use exclusively to watch games, so the case may be that people just don't watch the NBA on TV as much anymore, but I'm not sure. I would assume, however, that the NBA made that TV deal using numbers that justified it, so who knows.", "id": "damgbcp"}]]], "5fl4rj": ["Former NFL Star Darren Sharper Sentenced To 20 Years For Serial Rape of Two Women", "2016-11-29 23:43:32", 14, "http://www.thescore.com/nfl/news/1169509", [[8, "Good, fuck that dude.

It upped TV viewing, therefore upped TV money the NFL received from broadcasters. Once the TV revenue became the main teat, the NFL had to make it even more \"TV ready\". So, this is a good thing for the majority. You can now be a fan of players and not a team. Or you can be a casual fan of a team, but really passionate about \"your\" players. It put more eyeballs on the tube. The NFL is what it is today because of TV. But, \"back in my day\" you got 3 or 4 games a week, a noticeably smaller amount of commercials, but fucking grisly collisions weekly. (like American History X teeth-on-the-curb cringe-worthy hits) Some ended careers, and this was a *routine* occurrence.  Now we have terms like \"non-contact injury\" (sorry Vikings) but that shit either a) never happened or b) was never reported on. \n\nSo I use the term fantasy football as an umbrella term for part of the impetus that propelled change. Much of it actually quite good! When I first started to play fantasy football, we had to wait for the Tuesday edition of USA today to reference final stats - and much of that was high level stats -- none of the stuff that is popularly tracked these days was included then. That sucked. I remember sitting at my desk at work double checking the stats and translating those stats to our leagues points instead of waiting on the commissioner to do it. Good times, man. Good times. \n\nSo our collective need for more and more coverage has driven more and more ad revenue for broadcasters, and the NFL charging more and more for the right to broadcast games. But the best talent cannot survive \"The Longest Yard\" type games every week. So the NFL had to make sure ratings stay up - simply good business savvy there. No hate. But to do that the best talent (the most popular FF players) *have* to stay on the field. The NFL has to make it safer. Still do. \n\nTo wrap up this rant, the very thing that makes football so enticing to us: its equivalency to Coliseum combatants, or Gladiators; is now regulated to the point to take the animal nature out of it. The primalcy. \n\nI could have blamed astro-turf. Its simply an umbrella statement or short-hand for what many already know. My glib way of stating it probably put you off of it. \n\nI commented in the past (and got down voted to oblivion) that if we wanted to make the game safer: eliminate hard helmets. Hard football helmets become weapons. So our mostly American Gladiators get sent off into \"battle\" with a weapon. Makes sense. BUT, one does not see the same incident rate in Rugby or ARF. Neither of which use hard shell helmets. \n\n**now GET OFF MY LAWN**   j/k\n\n*edit: to say, I hope that answers your question. thanks", "id": "damk56h"}, {"comment": "[Relevant Patrice O'neal bit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5jZQZ1GY7Q)", "id": "damkiyu"}, {"comment": "Well shit.\n\n I could have avoided all that typing and just posted a Patrice O'Neal clip.  huh, TIL.

He played the position of Safety, a position on the defensive side of the football.  Safeties, of which there are two in a standard defense, are half of what's called the \"defensive backfield.\"  The other half are two cornerbacks.  Cornerbacks are often gracile, leaping deer, whose job it is to break up a thrown pass or intercept it, and the safety is the moose whose job consists of making the receivers regret being born.\n\nSafeties are there for the sole purpose of making sure that plays don't go far - a safety valve, if you will.  When running backs get past the line of scrimmage and the linebacker, it's the safety whose job it is to hit them.  When a wide receiver catches a pass deep over the middle, it's the safety's job to hit him so hard he loses the football and/or the will to live.  When a tight end gets behind the linebackers and catches a pass, it's the safety's job to hit him, because he's the only member of the defensive backfield who's a similar size to the tight end.  When the defense wants to rush the quarterback with more than four players (called a \"blitz\") the safety is one of the guys who will be called on to de-bone the quarterback.\n\nOr at least, that's how it used to be.

I live in a small town. We only had one team for each age group. If we were lucky, we had more than 9 girls suited up for a game meaning we had a least one relief player. We played against other (bigger) cities. One town had 5 teams, the other one had 4 and the last one had 3. Their talent pool was way bigger than ours. \n\nOnly two girls on my team had played soccer before. I was the third best player because I was able to run the length of the field without having to stop to take my breath. I volunteered to be the goalie because no one wanted to and I got to wear the cool jersey AND gloves. I played half of the summer as goalie. I had a GAA of 24.00. We lost our worst game 72-0, because the jerk ref refused to stop the score. Yes, I only had 24.00 because most refs felt bad after a while and stopped the score. \n\nMy team hated me because I kept allowing goals. But one of my defence was afraid of the ball and refused to touch it and the other one was more interested in making bouquets and crowns of dandelions. Eventually the coach said that anyone that didn't score a goal or an assist in the previous game would be entered in a draft to be the goalie for the next game and I was permanently exempt because I did more than my fair share (or that I sucked too much but that he didn't say). He said he wanted everyone to know how hard is it to be a goalie. \n\nI became the permanent midfielder (thanks to my ability to run the field without collapsing). I made good friends with the two girls who played soccer before since we were the only ones in the team who were there to really play.\n\nWe did end up winning two games during the season. One game we won because the other team forgot which field we were playing at (they waited for us at their field). And the other game we won against the #1 team in the league which was kind of a miracle because we were only 9 girls that day meaning no relief, and we totally outscored them, a real square and honest win at their home field. Our coach was crying that day. 18 years later it's still one of my feel good memories. \n\nEdit : another fun story from my summer of playing soccer. Our U11 girl team was in the same predicament as us. There was a big regional U11 tournament coming and they didn't have enough registration to get in. Since it was only recreational, and our reputation was already pretty bad, the other U11 teams suggested that our U13 players be allowed to participate in the U11 tournament so we could have least have a team. So me and a bunch of teammates went on and played against girls at least two years younger than us. Thanks to us, our town's team manage to at least not get completely crushed but we didn't made it further than the qualification round. But us U13 girls had so much fun and we were so popular with the U11 girls the organizers ask if we wanted to play for other teams as well. So if the two teams agreed, we would split equally between both of them and play for them.

Now, in the Canadian game, if the ball misses the uprights, the defence (Toronto) *has* to grab the ball, otherwise they concede a point and in this case, they'd lose the game.\n\nNow, here is where the *Rouge* comes into play. Also known as the \"What the fuck, how can they do that?! That's not a thing, that's a dogshit rule!\" rule.\n\nA rouge is, when the ball misses the uprights, if it's still in the endzone and the offence gains possession, or if they take down the player on defence who catches it, it *still counts as one point.* Which is why #88 of the Argonauts hurriedly kicks it back out, because he knows he can't run it out with the Alouettes offence closing in. As luck would have it, he kicked it right back into the arms of Montreal's kicker, initiating a bizarre game of kick-back-and-forth. So he kicks it *BACK* into the endzone, where it lands at the feet of what appears to be an intoxicated penguin in a Toronto jersey, who flippers it right into the arms of the dogpile of Montreal players.\n\nThey regained possession inside the endzone, which resulted in a touchdown. Monteral Alouettes 37 -- Toronto Argonauts 30.\n\nYou'd think a game ending like this would prompt many fans to call for the abolition of the Rouge, and you'd be right. It was contested in 2005, but ultimately the rule was kept.

As in \"Ok he bet Max holloway but he will never defeat Poirier. Ok he beat Poirier and others but he hasn't a chance against Mandez. Ok he defeated Mandez but he'll never beat Aldo etc\". This is why he had so much drawing power, because people in the sport new he was the real deal, and others *hate* his personality and wanted to watch him lose. What makes McGregor special is that he did exactly what he said he would even though people that it was impossible, he still had to fight a ton of people to do it.\n\n> Dana what he's going to do\n\nAh this came about because after McGregor defeated Aldo, he wanted a shot at the lightweight champ at the time RDA. This was all fine, but then RDA dropped out last min. Technically, McGregor could have been champion of the LW division last year, the next fight after Aldo, but RDA dropped out. Nate Daiz took his place but couldn't drop the weight, so McGregor had to fight at 170. Because RDA dropped out, it means it wasn't a title fight, just a vanity fight. Then McGregor lost that fight, and the *expected* thing would to be then defend his title as FW as he is the champ of that division. McGregor refused to and demanded a rematch, and Dana White said \"ok\", and that was the Diaz Mcgregor 2 fight that McGregor won. This is why people say Dana does what McGregor wants, because that was an unusual circumstance that people expected Dana to say no too.

Moreso than the professional counterpart.  This is due to rivalries between specific schools forged over many years of hard fought games between highly competitive colleges.\n\nThe picture here shows a game from Michigan versus Ohio State, arguably the biggest and most famous rivalry in all of American sports, including professional sports.  Ohio State is a massive, massive school and their stadium can hold upwards of 110k people, and indeed set a record for it with this game.  Michigan is just behind OSU on the magnitude chart.  On top of that Michigan and Ohio State are both competing for 1 of 4 coveted spots in the College Football Playoffs.  Whoever wins probably gets in, as they are both ranked 3 and 4 out of all the teams in the FBS division of college football (128 total).  I mention this so you can get a picture of how important this game is to sports fans.\n\nAnyway, so the picture shows the Ohio State QB, J.T. Barrett, crossing the first down marker late in the game in order to keep Ohio State's hopes of winning the game alive.  It was fourth and short, which meant that had he not crossed the yellow line (superimposed on the TV broadcast, it's not actually there in real life) then Ohio State would have lost.  When J.T. Barrett was approaching the first down, he was hit by several Michigan players and pinwheeled across the first down marker.  In real time it looked as if he was blatantly short, but was called for a first down anyway.  When Michigan challenged the play, there wasn't enough evidence in stop footage and slow motion to overturn the call without a question of doubt, thus giving OSU the ball.

In CFL: 21.\n\nso ~14% of teams have been CL champs vs ~67% of NFL teams.\n\nTo me, that means there's more parity in NFL: a random team has a higher chance of winning it all. For CL it's the usual suspects year in year out.\n\nMy original point is that CL != NFL. The idea that they're the same because it's a group stage and tournament is simplistic to the point of misleading. The regular season is about 1/3 group stage (6 conference games out of 16 total). 10 games are played outside your conference. That's not a group stage. The tournament (playoffs) include a wild card game for each conference, and a bye for each conference's best record team. It's not home/away aggregate. Games are played every Sunday, in the only league that exists, not sporadically during play in other leagues/tournaments. Finally every \"group stage\" starts with the same 32 teams, not a shifting subset of high ranking teams from multiple leagues. \n\nNFL and EPL and CL are all different beasts. Relegation is great for EPL etc but it just wouldn't work in the USA for culture and logistical reasons. To be fair I'm skeptical of NCAA football (though I watch it and some times prefer it to NFL) and could see the merit of a lower league for development, but relegation is simply a nonstarter. If Dak Prescott was no good, the Cowboys (the most valuable team on Earth, $4.6B) would be under relegation threat.

It becomes hard to keep food down.\nAnd then, after taking a Norco, the chances of me vomiting increase because I won't have eaten that much. Many people will attest that if you haven't eaten much before taking a Norco, chances are you will throw it up. It's a side effect of many pain medications.\nThey also are very addictive and harmful to your liver if you use them too much, which happens more than you think it would.\nMarijuana is so amazing, in the sense that within minutes of just a few inhalations, I am no longer nauseous, I can actually keep food down, and nearly all of the pain from the migraine will have subsided. I can at that point actually function and go about my day.\nIf I don't take care of a migraine before it has been several hours, it can sometimes last me up to a week before I can even go back to work.\nSure it's fun to use it recreationally, but the main reason people like me like to keep some on hand, is so I don't have to worry about missing a week of work because I can't even fucking open my eyes without my head feeling like it's going to explode.\n\nMarijuana is a beautiful thing that allows me to lessen my suffering immensely.

Whether it be zipping by you at 120mph in the slow lane, or creeping along at 30mph in the fast lane, or perhaps a motorcyclist flying by at 90mph on the sidewalk (or the shoulder/flat tire lane), they've certainly got every aspect of bad driving covered. \n\nHowever, I'm sure LA isn't the only place with crazy drivers, but if you haven't seen it for yourself, it's hard to imagine how bad it can get. \n\nWith all of that said, I think it's pretty safe to say that NYC is probably the most dreaded place for anybody to have to drive.", "id": "dakc857"}, {"comment": "> With all of that said, I think it's pretty safe to say that NYC is probably the most dreaded place for anybody to have to drive.\n\nThis is why we have a subway system...", "id": "dakfbpg"}, {"comment": "There was a billboard in Milwaukee, I don't recall the product, but it's slogan was 'Faster than a car with Illinois plates!'.\n\nSource: me, delivering stuff from Chicago to Milwaukee in the early 90's", "id": "dakf2xd"}, {"comment": ">I find the idea that WI is hilly to be hilarious.   \n  \nSo you might say you find it...hill-arious....", "id": "dakbk80"}, {"comment": "It is certainly not \"mountainy\" (?) but areas are definitely hilly. \n\nDriftless area Wisconsin: http://blog.joewigdahl.com/wp-content/imagescaler/b4e90755602bf9bc54130fca1697c3bc.jpg\n\nEDIT: Remembered the word.

High school Football is on fridays, college on Saturdays, and pro on Sunday.) \n\nIt's a good time to watch college football cause the post season is starting up. Instead of a playoff or something, all the winning teams go to an invitational \"bowl game\". They'll start in mid december with some of the lesser games. The important ones are the \"New Year's Six\" (Rose Bowl, Peach Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl) These six will be the best of the best from various corners of the country.

High school Football is on fridays, college on Saturdays, and pro on Sunday.) \n\nIt's a good time to watch college football cause the post season is starting up. Instead of a playoff or something, all the winning teams go to an invitational \"bowl game\". They'll start in mid december with some of the lesser games. The important ones are the \"New Year's Six\" (Rose Bowl, Peach Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl) These six will be the best of the best from various corners of the country.

Under the premise that god created everything, and assuming that this same god is the perfect embodiment of good, it would not be possible for there to be evil if not for the fact that god was also encompassing of evil. The Hindu religion sums this up nicely with a concept of balance between the two in their deities.

Is it all from the league or do the team owners cough it up?\n\nUltimately, the money for professional sports is based on support from the fans. The main routes are merchandise, ticket sales and ad revenue from TV broadcasts. Most team owners treat their team as a business, and thus are trying to make a profit, however occasionally an owner is willing to take a financial loss in order to sink more money into his team above what he'd normally be able to afford based on fan support alone.\n\n> How do they decide the cap for each year? Why is there hard caps in some sports and soft in other?\n\nThe main goals of a salary cap is to maintain competitive balance between teams. A strictly enforced cap will force all owners to try to win with the same financial constraints applied. Uncapped leagues are sometimes preferred so that teams with greater fan support naturally get a competitive advantage that some see as deserved given the higher level of support. The difference between a hard and soft cap is in how strictly you want to punish teams for exceeding the limit. A hard cap is as it sounds, where you absolutely can't spend more than that amount, while a soft cap will allow teams to spend more money to build a better team but with gradually increasing penalties that will eventually encourage a halt to spending. In addition to a salary cap, some leagues will also have a salary floor which is the minimum amount a team is allowed to spend. This is to force teams to at least attempt to be competitive rather than having the owner pocket all of the fans money himself without spending any on trying to win.\n\n> Do soft caps have an eventual hard cap? What's the penalty for going over the hard cap?\n\nHard cap penalties are typically severe enough that a team exceeding a hard cap will end up worse off because of it. They include things like expensive fines, loss or suspension of players, even vacating wins in some of the worst cases of abuse. Soft caps include weaker penalties such that teams may be willing to go over the cap and eat the cost of a penalty. An example might be a smaller fine that's painful for the organization, but affordable if the team is willing to pay it. Another example is that teams going over a soft cap would have to pay extra money directly to the rest of the teams in the league so that now everyone has a little extra to spend. Soft caps can be tiered with gradually increasing penalties so that at some point you reach a hard cap.\n\n> In which sports do players get paid even after they retire? Why? \n\nThis comes down to individual contracts with players, and how the league calculates team payroll. In some cases, money for a contract is guaranteed so that the player still gets paid even if they have a career ending injury or a decline in skill forces them to retire. Some teams will extend the duration of a contract for more years than what they actually want the player so that the average cost per year goes down. If a player wants to make $20M for a 4 year contract but the team can't afford $5M per year, they may offer a deal like $16M for 4 years with an additional $2M per year for the next 3 years after that to make up the difference. The player makes more overall, but the team saves money up front. Since most salary caps are based on the salary per year, teams can use these kinds of contracts to shuffle money around between years to avoid going over the cap. Typically leagues will have rules in place restricting how far that shuffling can go. In hockey the NHL stepped in and voided a handful of contracts where teams were signing players to 12-16 year long deals with no intention of the player actually having such a long career. It was obvious in those cases that teams were just trying to spread money out to avoid going over the salary cap.\n\nEach league is different, and the rules governing money typically come down to what type of competition they want to promote (capped vs uncapped), but ultimately the source of all that money comes from the fans of the sport.
