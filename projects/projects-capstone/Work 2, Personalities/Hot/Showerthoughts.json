How to keep space suits *cool* is a major engineering challenge in space suit design.\n\nVacuum itself isn't a huge problem. Human skin is gas tight.

Combined with an air-tight helmet and breathing system the space activity suit can, in theory, keep an astronaut happy and healthy, and be far less bulky. They would remain cool by sweating directly in to the vacuum of space.

Have learned CPR myself. \n\nHaving said that, since I became disabled (wheelchair user), I've been shocked by how many members of the public see me doing something, wrongly conclude that I need help, then proceed to rush up to me, ask ''Do you need help with that?'', but then -without waiting for a reply-, start to ''help'' me, which usually involves shoving my wheelchair hard, as if I am a stuck elephant (I'm actually a small skinny guy in a super lightweight chair. You should hear them huffing and puffing, it's bizarre). \n\nThey frequently grab the wrong part of the wheelchair and nearly dump me out of it forwards or backwards. They roll my chair over bumps or kerbs without popping a little wheelie first, which again, risks dumping me onto the street. \n\nOne time they even managed to rip part of my wheelchair off (they just handed it back to me with a sheepish look on their face and ran off. I laugh about it now, but at the time it meant paying \u00a380 for a new part which took me ages to save up for). \n\nAnother time, I had parked my chair near a flight of stairs and was waiting for someone to arrive. Suddenly a group of men who did not seem to speak much English appeared by my side.\n\nWithout even saying a word to me, the four of them picked me and my wheelchair up, carried me up the stairs and then put me down again. They looked very pleased with themselves, and they had managed to not accidentally throw me out of my chair, so I just didn't have the heart to get mad at them and insist they take me down again. I just thanked them with gestures and they went on their way.\n\nOnce they were out of sight, I had to slip onto the dirty ground, and shuffle on my bum down the stairs, dragging my wheelchair down with me. It would make a good comedy skit, but, when you know how often Good Samaritans get things wrong in real life, it can actually be quite scary to have strangers rush up to you and virtually force their 'help' upon you. Especially when you are already quite sick, in pain and on your own.\n\nThese are just some examples of how well meaning people can actually be quite dangerous (or sometimes annoying, or funny and very kind but simultaneously frustrating or even scary).  I have no idea why, but the majority of these people think they know exactly -when- you need help, and exactly -how- to best give it. Trust me, most people don't. The vast majority of people make at least one big mistake, such as picking up a wheelchair by it's back wheels (which, unless the brakes are on and v strong, will result in it rotating about it's axel and dumping it's occupant out, and/or the wheelchair frame smacking the Good Samaritan very hard in the shins. Never pick up a wheelchair by the back wheels. Always go for the frame. Push handles are usually ok but not guaranteed!).\n\nPlease able bodied people, if the person is concious, take just a few seconds to ask if they do actually need help, and if so, -how- best to help?\n\nIt's great that a lot of people do want to help. Almost everyday I thank my lucky stars that I am disabled in a time and place where I can count on most people being kind enough to offer assistance when needed (or not being particularly kind but wanting to look good in front of their partner/mates).\n\nBUT....you guys really do need to stop and ask first! This is doubly important if you are a guy trying to impress a lady by helping out a 'poor' cripple you have stumbled across in the street. You don't want to mess up by grabbing the wrong part of a wheelchair and having it come off in your hand! I'm happy to help you look good (I know what's going on), but my minimum 'payment' is that you don't wind up dumping me on the dirty pavement, screw up my chair, or carry me somewhere that I didn't want to go to anyway.

If they can see that people didn't just stand around but got stuck in there and did -something-, -anything-, that offers a lot of comfort to most people. The person who performs CPR feels better too knowing that they at least tried to help fix things.\n\nThat's probably why people often say ''dont' just stand there....do -something-!''. We often feel better about bad situations if someone does -something-. Nevermind if that -something- is rarely sucessful. So long as they didn't just stand there, that's enough to make most of us feel a lot better. \n", "id": "dar1xc0"}, {"comment": "Most frequently it's both too soft and too fast. People tend to get into what I call the jack rabbit and just go super fast. Like they say when you learn CPR, 100 compressions/min, or the song/rhythm \"staying alive\" or even \"another one bites the dust\" depending on your mentality.   The reason for this is to allow for ventricular refill so your next compression actually pumps blood. If you go to fast you aren't allowing the heart to refill with blood and thus don't get any blood anywhere. \n\nAs for too soft, you need to go hard!  About 2 inches deep in the average person.  The rib cage and sternum are surprisingly springy, especially in young adults and babies. I often know I am doing proper compressions when I break the odd rib... especially in he elderly where I will often break several. Never worry about going too hard, if you care that much about bringing someone \"back\", then it would be better they have broken ribs that will heal as opposed to having died because of poor compressions. \n\nEven in the hospital where we pump patients full of meds to assist with blood pressure and heart rate amongst other things, I would say we are only about 30% successful (just a guess of codes I have been to, not a stat) and that's only to get them to the ICU where they are then put on a mechanical ventilator and given enough meds to kill an elephant. \n", "id": "dargcmx"}]]], "5gd1dq": ["If a furry went to a formal event they could just dress like a penguin.", "2016-12-04 04:34:51", 8, "https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/5gd1dq/if_a_furry_went_to_a_formal_event_they_could_just/", [[2, "Would a furry go to a formal event?"]], [[{"comment": "Would a furry go to a formal event?", "id": "dar9vkg"}, {"comment": "no", "id": "dari22v"}]]], "5gcqhi": ["The characters in Futurama constantly making references to 20th century culture would be like people today constantly making references to the 10th century", "2016-12-04 03:29:08", 120, "https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/5gcqhi/the_characters_in_futurama_constantly_making/", [[29, "Yah, but we don't have the preserved heads of people from the 10th century :)"], [11, "Well, they are generally thought of as freaks and nerds by the rest of society.
