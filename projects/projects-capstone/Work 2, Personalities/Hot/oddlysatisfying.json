It's not one or the other, that's not how gastronomy works. They're both. A pancake is a pancake and a member of the cr\u00eape family. But that's not what you said.

And the shelf is great, though I should have used a thicker metal, it flexes a little too much. Gonna epoxy some 0.042\" 90\u00b0 angle stringers under it to stiffen it up.\n\nVery interesting video, thanks for sharing, I'll be buying a few of the tools I saw on his rack! \n\nAs to his system, I see it working *incredibly* well in a home garage, or in a small, tight-knit shop like he runs. \n\nWorking in a shop with over a hundred mechanics working all shifts and days, it's not an option, I need to be able to fully lock up my tools. Not *entirely* because I don't trust my fellow mechanics, but also because as an aviation mechanic I am *required* to keep track of all my tools at all times. If someone \"borrows\" a tool while I'm on my weekend, and they end up leaving it in the plane, guess who is gonna be on the hook for that error? It would be entirely on me to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was absolutely not me that left *my* tool in the plane.\n\nBut to address the organizational side of the video, Adam hit the nail on the head at 1:10-1:23, I know what tools I need, I know how often I use which ones, and I am able to shadow the ones I need in a way that's convenient. So I've accomplished his goals via my own system.\n\nAnd 11:32-11:54, his main complaint with drawers seems to be a lack of organization, and the inability to see everything. Both of which are problems with drawers that can be fixed by applying your creative and logical mind to your drawer system in the same way that he's applied his mind to his shelf/hanger system.\n\nI am able to work incredibly quickly because I know exactly where everything is. This is my ratchet+accessories drawer, that's my pliers drawer, etc. And I'm also able to see everything at a glance and analyze what tool is best for the job, same as with his system. \n\nTL;DR: my system has the advantage of being lockable and, due to the yellow base layer, it makes it glaringly obvious when I'm missing a tool.\n\nHis system has the pro that it is *not possible* for you to get lazy and pile random shit into it, ruining your system and obscuring the underlying tools. \n\nIn short, whatever system you use, as long as you think ahead, and stay disciplined in the use of your system, it will work. The advantage of his system is that it forces you to use it correctly every time.\n\nSorry, that was really long. His system is interesting to me, and i love tools!

I liked the looks of yours, very clean and streamline, none of that ridiculous tactical stuff hanging off every surface of it. And I love that forward grip! Looks very comfortable, secure, and stable!\n\nAdam definitely moves faster than I do. His actions always look frantic and rushed to me. I work fast compared to many of my aviation coworkers, but I look slow and methodical next to Adam. I need to get it right, and get it right the first time, but this plane also has to be in the air by 0630, it's a balance.\n\nYeah, I cut the foam myself. You can find it online with a little difficulty, but my workplace also sells a special Skydrol (corrosive hydraulic fluid) resistant foam to us at a *very* reasonable price. A sharp utility or hobby blade cuts it like butter, and it melts nicely if you decide to cookie cutter something.\n\nI work on the Bombardier Q400, nothing exciting but it's a good job to get me experience in the industry!

A knife dulls because that V shape has been flattened out into a ) shape by cutting into things. You create that V shape by putting the knife on a stone at a angle then you use the abrasive stone to shave off the dull, bent over steel until you have created a V.\n\n\n1k, 2k, 5k, 8k and 12k is referring to the grit of the stone. In simple terms the lower the grit the faster it will remove metal, the faster it will make a V and the faster it will sharpen the knife. 1k is the lowest grit on this list and 12k is the highest on this list.\n Using only a low grit will result in a toothy or jagged edge that isn't very good for slicing things. Slowly working your way up to higher and higher grits will result in a very fine, polished edge that it great at slicing and is very sharp.\n\nWhen you sharpen a knife you want to start at a low grit stone so you can get it sharp quick but then you want to progressively sharpen on higher and higher grit stones so that you can refine the edge so that it is no longer toothy and jagged. The high grit stones don't really remove metal from the edge, they just refine and smooth out the toothy edge until it is fine and polished. This is why the guy in the video used several different types of stones, they were all different grits and he was slowing going up the grits so he made a sharp and fine edge.\n\nDisclaimer: This is **extremely** simplified and I had a ton of trouble writing this out without using jargon but the basic concepts are there. I also forgot to mention that a strop is extremely high grit and is used to polish a edge past what stones can give you.\n\n\nEDIT: I'm terrible at explaining things so if you're still confused check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVxKOET1nFA).

First, the fructose molecules that make up most of the honey don't exhibit the strong hydrogen-bonding behavior that creates water's extra strong surface tension. \n\nMore importantly, the viscosity of honey vastly overwhelms any effects of surface tension in this case. Water has a very low viscosity, relatively speaking, and there's just not enough of it to create the shear stresses necessary to cause a faucet stream to bend around your finger.

While the flow looks very similar to the air flow over the ping pong ball above (if one could see the air flow), the cause is not really the Coand\u0103 effect. Here, because it is a flow of water into air, there is little entrainment of the surrounding fluid (the air) into the jet (the stream of water).

It was so great that the winds carried it across other nations ... That amount of radioactive material was spread over a large area due to the blast, fallout and subsequent wind/weather patterns. There are areas that are still very radioactive, as well as some areas that are relatively safe. The problem is it's kind of like a shotgun pattern where the dangerous areas are right next to the safe ones. \n\nThe goal of the cap is to essentially stop the slow bleed of nuclear materials, or at least contain it so it's not harmful/spread by nature or fires.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/27/science/chernobyl-capping-a-catastrophe.html\n\n> While the number of radioactive particles released during the explosion and subsequent fire was enormous, they came from only about five tons of the reactor fuel. Close to 200 tons of fuel \u2014 uranium and its highly radioactive fission byproducts \u2014 remain in the bowels of the destroyed building.\n\n> At Three Mile Island, all the fuel remained inside the containment vessel, yet it took more than a decade to safely remove it, essentially by remote control. It will be a much more complex task to remove fuel and debris from Unit 4, which was ripped apart by the explosion and further destroyed by fire and by the efforts to fight it.\n\nThe goal is to prevent nature from continuing to be destroyed by the core. \n\nHere's a wiki about the exclusion zone (that's what they call the radioactive/off limits area): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Exclusion_Zone\n\nI tried finding a better source, but knew the radiation would be around for a few more hundred years to where it'd be unsafe to inhabit, but at least according to #12, the Exclusion Zone will remain dangerously radioactive / uninhabitable for another 300 years:\nhttp://mentalfloss.com/article/78779/12-facts-about-chernobyls-exclusion-zone-30-years-after-disaster\n\nOne of the bigger/more prominent concerns right now is wildfires. Recently this fear increased considerably because areas like the Red Forest (referenced in the Wiki above) is all dead material. The problem is that the radiation is so great that it has inhibited bacterial and fungal growth. This means the dead material from the original explosion/flora death has not decayed to any significant amount. If the Red Forest were to ignite, we'd again see another significant spread of highly radioactive material inside the smoke from the fire.
