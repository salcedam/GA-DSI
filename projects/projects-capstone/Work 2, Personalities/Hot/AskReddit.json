", "id": "daqvyxb"}, {"comment": "It was 96% last week, who the fucked upped this invented figure by another 1% ?\n\nI would also remind you that science is not a democracy. It is irrelevant whether 47% , 57%,67% or 97% of scientists say one thing is true what we need to look at is ALL the evidence both in support of the hypothesis and against the hypothesis. If there is any evidence against then surely this implies the hypothesis is incomplete and/or faulty.\n\nOne of the interesting things about the AGW theory is that the exact mechanism proposed to explain how it happens has changed over time. Now most of us are not scientists but we can understand some of the basics about the issue. Lets start off with the known history of variable climate on Earth before man's relatively recent high population and high energy consumption. I think we all know that the world has had periods of very variable temperature. I have a picture of people skating on the river Thames in London when it froze over for example. There is also core sample evidence of the MWP. So in light of this known history it must be obvious that simple measurement of small changes in temperature over a few years or decades will not be sufficient to prove AGW. So what will suffice as proof ? Are we going to measure concentrations of CO2 in the upper atmosphere ? Where is the *experimental* proof that a ppm change causes a change in heat balance ? What do satellite data tell us ? \n\nI know it is relatively easy and simple for the ordinary non-scientist to simply \"accept\" a majority of scientist are RIGHT but do you think that in the total history of mankind that this has always been the definition of TRUTH ? I suspect you might well find rather more than one example where the majority of scientists have been completely and utterly WRONG.

As with cigarettes, you can follow the money on the 3% to see why they're holding out.\n\nProgress means moving forward now, not endlessly questioning objective evidence to fit a subjective narrative.", "id": "daqxgnh"}, {"comment": "I have to repeat yet again that science is not a democracy. One needs to search for the truth. There is plenty to find relating to both sides of the argument on the internet. For example you will find some very interesting stuff on the fictional nature of this oft quoted 97%. So lets just take this 97% as potentially suspicious for a start and consider your comment about \"money\". To me it looks like the majority (AGW believers) have huge amount of funds to play with whereas the minority (AGW non-believers) are in most cases independent scientists with no axe to grind and in nobodies pocket.\nAnyway back to the search for truth. We need to look into this in more detail. Many of the studies supporting AGW have been criticised by the other side and I must say in most cases they seem to have valid points. We need more proper independent scientific thought on this in order to , shall we say, knock the heads of the 2 sides together and get more accurate ideas somewhat nearer the truth.\nLets just look at one example. Temperature measurement data of average earth temperature. AGW believers think the actual data shows the earth warming up. AGW non-believers say the results are skewed to show a larger increase than is correct because many of the thermometers are located in urban areas and therefore subject to the local heat from industry, central heating, etc. We wonder why on such a simple criticism it is not possible for the 2 sides to come together and decide this on the basis of proper scientific considerations. I think if I was plotting the average temperature of the school classroom my teacher would be right in querying my results if the bunsen burner was next to my thermometer. So we ask WHY does the IPCC and other pro-AGW bodies not accept a valid criticism and correct their data input.\n\nThere are many other similar examples. When you see one side of a debate which is supposed to be based on science not willing to correct or even respond to apparently valid criticism from the other side of the debate you are forced to consider why. Is it perhaps because if they do so then their whole theory begins to crumble ?\n\nSo in conclusion I say that the so called evidence is far from objective, the so called consensus is highly suspect (probably manipulated data or misinterpreted) and we need to have more discussion and more scientific work on this before we spend any more money and time on what might be an enormous mistake.     ", "id": "dar590u"}, {"comment": "http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/\n\nI disagree with your conclusion and your subjective observations.\n\nI further take issue with your using your subjective opinion about the 3% rather than following the money.

Irrespective of the percentages they cannot both be right. We need to find out which side is scientifically correct and you wont do that by simply looking at percentages of consensus. To find the truth in something scientific you need to have discussions, arguments, experiments, studies, data collection preferably by those with an independent outlook. This is now quite difficult with AGW as the pro-AGW side have a massive amount of governmental funding (I remember seeing one estimate in the trillions of $). In addition the subject has some of the attributes of a cult or religion and open debate is problematic sometimes.\nI tend to have a look at certain specific things like the accuracy of an IPCC computer model for example. The problem always seems to be that whatever specific thing you look at in detail on the AGW side there seems to be a perfectly valid criticism from the other side which has not been addressed.\n\nA quick trundle through the internet revealed (feel free to correct me if I am wrong) that the origin of this 97% consensus figure was from the esteemed ~~scientist~~ cartoonist, Mr. J. Cook and it looks like his [mathematical skills](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/09/03/cooks-97-consensus-disproven-by-a-new-paper-showing-major-math-errors/) were not as good as his artistic ones.", "id": "dar6go7"}, {"comment": "Actually, if you had read the link I just posted, 97.1% is the percentage of papers expressing an opinion on AGW that concur mankinds contribution is significant.

I was living with a mutual friend who took the plunge with me to go to grad school.\n\nIt was two weeks to the day of his move. He was celebrating getting his first big boy job out of college, while I was working hard to make a name for myself at the company I worked for. We were supposed to have date night, but the roommate invited himself before I got home from work and the boyfriend didn't object. I was tired. It was Friday after another grueling week since I had just been promoted. I told them to go and have boys night. I wasn't happy, he wasn't happy, and the roommate was oblivious to the entire situation.\n\nFor the two weeks my boyfriend was there he spent day and night with the roommate drinking and talking about whatever and playing video games while I worked. I'd get home and the boyfriend would be with the roommate and barely acknowledge my presence.\n\nThey go out and I send the boyfriend a text letting him know what was up because while at home the roommate wouldn't leave our side so we could discuss. Boyfriend gets pissed I didn't say anything before he left. He proceeds to get hammered along with the roommate. Story goes that on the walk home they decided they wanted to do the MDMA boyfriend brought from home. I didn't know he had it. Roommate was seeing a stripper he met one night during drunken escapes. She gets invited. I'm asleep in bed with our beautiful dog and have no idea this is happening. \n\nI wake up at about 2am to loud dubstep in my living room. Instantly I'm hit with sharp pains because I know my boyfriend so I know what he's up to. I walk to the living room and he's under his special blanket with the stripper. I grab my cigarettes and proceed to bolt. Roommate stops me and asks me to just smoke with him on the patio. I do. I tell him I know they're high and I know what is going on. He plays dumb. We finish and I return to my room and toss and turn. Hours later the boyfriend tried to join. I ask him calmly why he thinks that is appropriate for him to be getting into my bed after that display. He plays dumb.\n\nNow I let them play dumb because I want to play dumb. Two weeks is all it took for him to shatter my heart after 5 months long distance and 2 years of struggle before that.

When she's through I decided I needed to talk to him to compare stories. They match. He swears it was an inebriated mistake. Was sleeping with my friend at the beginning of our relationship for 3 months a mistake too?\n\nI tried for a year after. I went off the deep end.

She'd had an affair before, saying that she was lonely because they didn't go out much (remember, he was working his ass off... very long hours).  He forgave her and made an effort to work less/take her out to play pool/go dancing, etc.  He had to work Thanksgiving and for whatever reason, needed to swap out the car he was driving with the one that was sitting at home in the driveway.  It was late so he just went home and switched cars without bothering to wake her and the kids.  He only worked about a mile from the house and hadn't gotten very far when he hit a bump and felt something rolling in the trunk.  He pulled over into a parking lot to investigate, opened the trunk and lo & behold, curled up in a ball pretending to be asleep was the guy she'd had the affair with.  Tom couldn't believe his fucking eyes... he'd played pool with this guy on one of the nights he'd taken his wife out!  He closed the trunk and had in internal debate over whether to back into a telephone pole or perhaps drive the car into a lake.  Concluded that this dude wasn't worth going to prison for, opened the trunk and told him to get out.  Guy blearily got out and walked off.

When I was on my own and re-analysed the situation, I realised what he did, and decided that to prevent that kind of manipulation again, the next time I confronted him it would be with solid evidence. So I start putting out feelers among our mutual friends, and one day one of them contacts me and says he has a recording of him bragging about his sexcapades. His condition for passing it on to me was that my ex could never know how I got my info. By happy coincidence, this dear friend finally relinquishes the recording on my birthday, and I decide even though I can't use the recording to confront my ex directly, I cannot continue even one more day in this situation. So I call him (the bastard had not even phoned to wish me happy birthday by this point) and tell him I have irrefutable evidence that he has been cheating on me, and that if he wants to find out how I know, he has to give me the name of the girl he cheated on me with. He didn't know that I knew the girl's name already, so he ums and aahs for a while and finally confesses. But gives me a different girl's name and details about when it happened.

There was my ex-wife half naked and the French doors, leading to outside, were wide open.  \n\nI immediately started to interrogate her, asking her who is he, what's his name.  She wouldn't give it up.  I continued on  asking and probing, over and over. She finally gave me his first name and refused to give me his last name.  So I immediately got on the phone with a close work friend of hers and asked her friend if she knew his last name and what street did he live on.  After obtaining this information I looked up his information and got his home phone number.  \n\nI called the number and and told his wife, now ex-wife, what just happened. She said it couldn't be true.  I told her that if she wanted the license plate number from his car, I would give it to her.  At that time she finally realized that what I was saying was true and she asked for my phone number and said she would call me in the next day or two.  After I hung up the call, I gathered up his belongings, shoes and shirt, put them on top of his car, moved my car (I had him blocked in) and yelled out into the darkness of night and told him by name to \"get the f*ck out of here\".   About ten minutes later I heard his car start up and he left.  \n\n \n\n", "id": "dar4jrp"}, {"comment": "You left out the paragraph where you and his now ex had a revenge bang.\n\nBut seriously, that sucks.

I hope the assholes see this.\n\nHe had just moved 1300 miles to be with me in my hometown after a rough start and my large move back home. I was living with a mutual friend who took the plunge with me to go to grad school.\n\nIt was two weeks to the day of his move. He was celebrating getting his first big boy job out of college, while I was working hard to make a name for myself at the company I worked for. We were supposed to have date night, but the roommate invited himself before I got home from work and the boyfriend didn't object. I was tired. It was Friday after another grueling week since I had just been promoted. I told them to go and have boys night. I wasn't happy, he wasn't happy, and the roommate was oblivious to the entire situation.\n\nFor the two weeks my boyfriend was there he spent day and night with the roommate drinking and talking about whatever and playing video games while I worked. I'd get home and the boyfriend would be with the roommate and barely acknowledge my presence.\n\nThey go out and I send the boyfriend a text letting him know what was up because while at home the roommate wouldn't leave our side so we could discuss. Boyfriend gets pissed I didn't say anything before he left. He proceeds to get hammered along with the roommate. Story goes that on the walk home they decided they wanted to do the MDMA boyfriend brought from home. I didn't know he had it. Roommate was seeing a stripper he met one night during drunken escapes. She gets invited. I'm asleep in bed with our beautiful dog and have no idea this is happening. \n\nI wake up at about 2am to loud dubstep in my living room. Instantly I'm hit with sharp pains because I know my boyfriend so I know what he's up to. I walk to the living room and he's under his special blanket with the stripper. I grab my cigarettes and proceed to bolt. Roommate stops me and asks me to just smoke with him on the patio. I do. I tell him I know they're high and I know what is going on. He plays dumb. We finish and I return to my room and toss and turn. Hours later the boyfriend tried to join. I ask him calmly why he thinks that is appropriate for him to be getting into my bed after that display. He plays dumb.\n\nNow I let them play dumb because I want to play dumb. Two weeks is all it took for him to shatter my heart after 5 months long distance and 2 years of struggle before that. He promised with the change of scenery and not knowing anyone that he'd be loyal and dedicated. I was dumb to believe he would change the need for female attention just for the chance to be with me.\n\nA month goes by and I get a text from the stripper who is in the roommate's room while the roommate is at the bar with friends. Everyone has treated me like an outsider for the month. She wants to talk. She comes in and tells all. Boyfriend walks in during and very quickly leaves. When she's through I decided I needed to talk to him to compare stories. They match. He swears it was an inebriated mistake. Was sleeping with my friend at the beginning of our relationship for 3 months a mistake too?\n\nI tried for a year after. I went off the deep end. Now he's living in my hometown in our apartment with his new girlfriend who moved in the day I moved out. And the roommate has a kid with the stripper.

I never thought I would be defending high waisted jeans, of all things, but you know what, I actually really love the ones that I own. Number one: they're super comfy. They don't slip down like low rise jeans, and I don't have to worry about my asscrack playing peekaboo when I bend down (which is like half the reason guys hate them) The back pocket placement is also great - I can leave my phone in my back pocket and sit down without being bothered by it. That's why girls are wearing them more now - they're comfy af\n\nAlso, as many comments below point out, the high waist holds back that little pooch that many normal-sized women naturally get in their lower belly region aka no muffin top - the hips seem to taper more naturally into the waist\n\nHowever, I will say they're not for all body types and dressing styles. Paired with a crop top on a girl with an ass, they look great. Also, if you're short like me, high waists make your legs look longer. But if you don't have the ass for it, it won't flatter you\n\nEDIT 2: just pictures of people rocking high waisted jeans.

So I have essentially the same look with more comfort\n\nEDIT 4: In response to the multiple comments that the girls in the pictures are hot and therefore would look good in anything, yeah, I DID say it's not a look everyone can pull off. You need a good figure to make it look really good. My point with the pictures was just to prove that there ARE body types and figures that will look good in high waisted pants. Most people who wear high-waisted pants don't have that body shape, which is why so many people come away with the impression that no one can pull off a high waist, when the truth is you just need a specific figure (hourglass)\n\nBut you shouldn't feel like you have to have a perfect figure in order to wear a fucking comfy pair of pants. So what if you don't look like a fucking model in them. jfc high waisted pants are COMFORTABLE. You don't need a reason beyond that to wear them.\n\nEDIT 5: linking /u/sashafurgang's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5g6hrf/what_would_have_been_considered_uncool_15_years/daqjgg6/) because upon further reflection it's true. Also wanted to add that part of the reason the girls in the pics look hot is because they're specifically dressing to enhance their asse(t)s and hide their flaws. People are just looking at the finished product and assuming they would look good in anything because the high waisted jeans are helping them look better than how they otherwise would.

I never thought I would be defending high waisted jeans, of all things, but you know what, I actually really love the ones that I own. Number one: they're super comfy. They don't slip down like low rise jeans, and I don't have to worry about my asscrack playing peekaboo when I bend down (which is like half the reason guys hate them) The back pocket placement is also great - I can leave my phone in my back pocket and sit down without being bothered by it. That's why girls are wearing them more now - they're comfy af\n\nAlso, as many comments below point out, the high waist holds back that little pooch that many normal-sized women naturally get in their lower belly region aka no muffin top - the hips seem to taper more naturally into the waist\n\nHowever, I will say they're not for all body types and dressing styles. Paired with a crop top on a girl with an ass, they look great. Also, if you're short like me, high waists make your legs look longer. But if you don't have the ass for it, it won't flatter you\n\nEDIT 2: just pictures of people rocking high waisted jeans.

So I have essentially the same look with more comfort\n\nEDIT 4: In response to the multiple comments that the girls in the pictures are hot and therefore would look good in anything, yeah, I DID say it's not a look everyone can pull off. You need a good figure to make it look really good. My point with the pictures was just to prove that there ARE body types and figures that will look good in high waisted pants. Most people who wear high-waisted pants don't have that body shape, which is why so many people come away with the impression that no one can pull off a high waist, when the truth is you just need a specific figure (hourglass)\n\nBut you shouldn't feel like you have to have a perfect figure in order to wear a fucking comfy pair of pants. So what if you don't look like a fucking model in them. jfc high waisted pants are COMFORTABLE. You don't need a reason beyond that to wear them.\n\nEDIT 5: linking /u/sashafurgang's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5g6hrf/what_would_have_been_considered_uncool_15_years/daqjgg6/) because upon further reflection it's true. Also wanted to add that part of the reason the girls in the pics look hot is because they're specifically dressing to enhance their asse(t)s and hide their flaws. People are just looking at the finished product and assuming they would look good in anything because the high waisted jeans are helping them look better than how they otherwise would.

It also makes for a conversation piece when you have friends over and they want to pick out an album to play.

Her grandfather told me on his deathbed that he was glad that she found a man (I was seventeen at the time, but he told me that I carry a sense of confidence and dedication that only a man has) who was a hard working person and who genuinely cared for others. I had never called him anything other than Mr. Ex's grandfather, but he told me to call him Grandpa for the last week of his life. \n\nHer grandmother told her the day she met me to never let me go, and that she's never seen a deeper connection between to people in her life.... right in front of my GF's parents. \n\n\nLast one was from my ex and her friend. She had hurt her back badly in a soccer game right before we were set to spend two weeks together at her cottage. I cared for her the whole week; made food, carried her to the dock so she could put her toes in the water, applied icy hot to her back (Lenny face), and stroke her hair until she fell asleep, (the beds were singles so we couldn't fit together for the entire night) I slept in a chair next to her so I could get anything she needed quickly. About ten days into the trip her friend comes over to hang out with us, they were sitting together on the couch watching TV so I asked them if they wanted anything to eat, they said sure so I made them both a banana split with cherries, chocolate sauce, and a few crushed peanuts. As I'm walking down the hall towards the living room I hear them talking about me, my ex said \"he's taken care of me the entire trip\" \nFriend responds \"yeah but wouldn't anyone?\" \nEx \"no I mean he hasn't been upset in the slightest, I haven't told him that my back stopped hurting three days ago because I think he enjoys taking care of me more than I enjoy being taken care of\" \nFriend \"I think your blowing this out of proportion\" \nEx \"he bought me tampons last month when I said I needed to pick some up\" \nFriend \"... no way... you serious?\"\nEx \"yeah... he didn't even flinch when I mentioned it, I asked him if he was ok with that and he told me that it's a natural part of the human body\"\nFriend \"holy shit\"\nEx \"I think I want to marry him\" \nFriend \"simmer down there, it's too early to think like that\" \nBy this point I stop eavesdropping because the ice cream was melting, so I made a noise to let them know I was coming.

People go by themselves, find a few people they think are cool, and use their implants to strike up strong feelings. They have fun for the night, then immediately turn the feelings off when they go home.

It took another 2 hours before a boat got to us, thirsty, hungry, freezing, it would have been rough if we had tried to stay in the marsh overnight. \n\nIt turned out my wife had reported us missing, but she had no idea where we were in a large area.

Slipped, fell forward, put my arms out to catch myself like usual, landed weird and my shoulder ended up sticking up a good inch or so. Felt like I had gotten shot (or what I imaged being shot would feel like). Honestly never felt such pain in my life. Luckily I'm on the IM fields at school and they get a golf cart to take me to the trainers room. They tell me to lay down flat on my stomach on one of the tables, and let my left arm hang over the side. \n\n\nThis is all happening in slow motion to me, I can't even understand what they're saying because I'm using every fiber of my being to keep from crying out in pain. I'm holding my shoulder and I can feel the bone bulging out from the top of my shoulder. It's awful. \n\n\nI lay down on the table and hang my arm over the side. FUCK. THAT. Made the pain even worse. They keep telling me, \"relax. Relax.\" Yeah right, I'm basically hyperventilating. I manage to take a deep breath and just let it hang loose. Click. I felt the ball slide right into the socket. Sweet relief. I'm still in pain, but nothing like what it was before. \n\n\nI try letting it heal, and don't bother going to a specialist or getting an MRI or anything and a couple months go by. Well I end up busting ass on some stair and fuck it up again, luckily it went right back into place, but at that point I knew I had to get it checked out. Few more months later and it's mid-July and I'm getting surgery.\n\n\nSurgery itself isn't bad at all. They give you a nerve block that lasts the day, and it's arthroscopic so the cuts are tiny. However, the pain is seriously pretty bad during the first few weeks. Then it's another few weeks till you can get out of the sling. Then it's a couple months of physical therapy. All in all, it's about a 4-5 month recovery, for me anyways. \n\n\nWell, fast forward to the summer following my first surgery. My shoulder's feeling great, I'm going to the gym for the first time in my life. I'm feeling confident and healthy. And most of all, my left shoulder's finally getting back to normal. \"Don't hurt yourself,\" my mom would always say whenever we talked while I was at school. \"Yes ma'am,\" I'd always say. Ooops. \n\n\nIt's the middle of June and summer session for school's almost over. I decide to go long boarding on campus with a friend. And I'm sure you can guess what happens. It's the end of the night, and it's the last hill to bomb. It's one of the steeper hills on campus and it's definitely gnarly. Well my friend doesn't feel like hitting it, so he goes to grab the car. I've done it a thousand times before so I'm not worried at all. \n\n\nI hit the hill. I'm picking up speed and heading for the \"drop.\" I'm flying down it and I'm almost to the bottom when all of the sudden, this girl walks straight out in front of me and into the street. It's late now, like 12:30, and the girl's got her backpack on - must've been coming from the library. Well this numbskull's walking around at night, alone, with earphones in and must not have heard me coming. I pull a hard left and barely miss the girl. For a second, I thought I could manage it, but then I started wobbling. Not long after that I'm flying through the air, fast as hell. Conveniently, I land completely on my left shoulder, skidding across the pavement, cutting up my hip and knee pretty bad. \n\n\nAs soon as I hit the pavement with my shoulder, I knew what happened. The only difference this time was that my shoulder was dislocated in the other direction, and this time there was just an empty gap where my shoulder usually was. I immediately hop up, this girl looked at me get up and just kept on walking - I was flabbergasted. But I couldn't give two shits about anything expect my shoulder. This was worse than the first time. By far. I grab my board and start walking to where my friend said he would pick me up. I shit you not, I must've looked like the walking dead. I was shuffling, limping, hunching over, breathing heavy. Well I'm in so much pain that I start trying to push my shoulder back up into place by just grabbing my left arm with my right and jamming it up into the socket. No luck. And something I didn't know at the time was that I had actually fractured my shoulder as well when I hit the pavement.\n\nSo I was jamming my fractured and dislocated shoulder into the socket, trying to relieve the incredible pain. No luck. 15 minutes later (what felt like an eternity) and my friend finally finds me (when I didn't make it to the spot for a while, he started driving around looking for me). He drives me to the hospital \u2013 longest 15-minute drive of my life. \n\nI get to the emergency room and have to wait there 10 minutes before the nurses even check it out. They make me go through all the typical nonsense: \"what's your pain factor, on a scale of 1-10?\" and such. Well after *that*, I wait another 10-15 minutes to be seen by the doctor on staff. Well apparently this guy is a pro with shoulders, or that's what the nurses keep saying to make me feel better. \n\nWe get into a room and they make me take an x-ray before the doctor tries to help. After that, he starts asking about my pain factor and shit too. I'm trying to speed up the process, because I've been through this before and just want it to be over. He put my shoulder around his neck and squeezes the shit out of it while lifting up his body and basically tried to wrestle it back into place. NO DICE. But at least I'm in even more pain now. He goes for a second attempt, and this time he really wrestles the shit out of it, after a good 30 seconds of excruciating pain, it finally goes back up into the socket. Goddam. \n\nI get it x-rayed afterwards and they tell me it's also fractured. Great. Well it's the beginning of August, almost exactly a year after my first one, and I'm back at the same place getting the same surgery on the same shoulder by the same surgeon.

Slipped, fell forward, put my arms out to catch myself like usual, landed weird and my shoulder ended up sticking up a good inch or so. Felt like I had gotten shot (or what I imaged being shot would feel like). Honestly never felt such pain in my life. Luckily I'm on the IM fields at school and they get a golf cart to take me to the trainers room. They tell me to lay down flat on my stomach on one of the tables, and let my left arm hang over the side. \n\n\nThis is all happening in slow motion to me, I can't even understand what they're saying because I'm using every fiber of my being to keep from crying out in pain. I'm holding my shoulder and I can feel the bone bulging out from the top of my shoulder. It's awful. \n\n\nI lay down on the table and hang my arm over the side. FUCK. THAT. Made the pain even worse. They keep telling me, \"relax. Relax.\" Yeah right, I'm basically hyperventilating. I manage to take a deep breath and just let it hang loose. Click. I felt the ball slide right into the socket. Sweet relief. I'm still in pain, but nothing like what it was before. \n\n\nI try letting it heal, and don't bother going to a specialist or getting an MRI or anything and a couple months go by. Well I end up busting ass on some stair and fuck it up again, luckily it went right back into place, but at that point I knew I had to get it checked out. Few more months later and it's mid-July and I'm getting surgery.\n\n\nSurgery itself isn't bad at all. They give you a nerve block that lasts the day, and it's arthroscopic so the cuts are tiny. However, the pain is seriously pretty bad during the first few weeks. Then it's another few weeks till you can get out of the sling. Then it's a couple months of physical therapy. All in all, it's about a 4-5 month recovery, for me anyways. \n\n\nWell, fast forward to the summer following my first surgery. My shoulder's feeling great, I'm going to the gym for the first time in my life. I'm feeling confident and healthy. And most of all, my left shoulder's finally getting back to normal. \"Don't hurt yourself,\" my mom would always say whenever we talked while I was at school. \"Yes ma'am,\" I'd always say. Ooops. \n\n\nIt's the middle of June and summer session for school's almost over. I decide to go long boarding on campus with a friend. And I'm sure you can guess what happens. It's the end of the night, and it's the last hill to bomb. It's one of the steeper hills on campus and it's definitely gnarly. Well my friend doesn't feel like hitting it, so he goes to grab the car. I've done it a thousand times before so I'm not worried at all. \n\n\nI hit the hill. I'm picking up speed and heading for the \"drop.\" I'm flying down it and I'm almost to the bottom when all of the sudden, this girl walks straight out in front of me and into the street. It's late now, like 12:30, and the girl's got her backpack on - must've been coming from the library. Well this numbskull's walking around at night, alone, with earphones in and must not have heard me coming. I pull a hard left and barely miss the girl. For a second, I thought I could manage it, but then I started wobbling. Not long after that I'm flying through the air, fast as hell. Conveniently, I land completely on my left shoulder, skidding across the pavement, cutting up my hip and knee pretty bad. \n\n\nAs soon as I hit the pavement with my shoulder, I knew what happened. The only difference this time was that my shoulder was dislocated in the other direction, and this time there was just an empty gap where my shoulder usually was. I immediately hop up, this girl looked at me get up and just kept on walking - I was flabbergasted. But I couldn't give two shits about anything expect my shoulder. This was worse than the first time. By far. I grab my board and start walking to where my friend said he would pick me up. I shit you not, I must've looked like the walking dead. I was shuffling, limping, hunching over, breathing heavy. Well I'm in so much pain that I start trying to push my shoulder back up into place by just grabbing my left arm with my right and jamming it up into the socket. No luck. And something I didn't know at the time was that I had actually fractured my shoulder as well when I hit the pavement.\n\nSo I was jamming my fractured and dislocated shoulder into the socket, trying to relieve the incredible pain. No luck. 15 minutes later (what felt like an eternity) and my friend finally finds me (when I didn't make it to the spot for a while, he started driving around looking for me). He drives me to the hospital \u2013 longest 15-minute drive of my life. \n\nI get to the emergency room and have to wait there 10 minutes before the nurses even check it out. They make me go through all the typical nonsense: \"what's your pain factor, on a scale of 1-10?\" and such. Well after *that*, I wait another 10-15 minutes to be seen by the doctor on staff. Well apparently this guy is a pro with shoulders, or that's what the nurses keep saying to make me feel better. \n\nWe get into a room and they make me take an x-ray before the doctor tries to help. After that, he starts asking about my pain factor and shit too. I'm trying to speed up the process, because I've been through this before and just want it to be over. He put my shoulder around his neck and squeezes the shit out of it while lifting up his body and basically tried to wrestle it back into place. NO DICE. But at least I'm in even more pain now. He goes for a second attempt, and this time he really wrestles the shit out of it, after a good 30 seconds of excruciating pain, it finally goes back up into the socket. Goddam. \n\nI get it x-rayed afterwards and they tell me it's also fractured. Great. Well it's the beginning of August, almost exactly a year after my first one, and I'm back at the same place getting the same surgery on the same shoulder by the same surgeon. Recovery the second go around was a little slower, but by January my shoulder was feeling pretty secure.

For me, it's so painful, I'm basically flinching the whole time with my eyes closed and have to think of pleasant things so as to shut out the pain. Think about end result. The more pain there is, the more hairs that are being permanently zapped out of their sockets. Pain means something fruitful is happening.\n\nBefore you go, you have to shave everywhere the laser is gonna go. Laser doesn't take well to non-shaved hair.

If that's the best they've got on him, he's pure as the wind driven snow. Has there ever been an attorney general more racist and race-obsessed than Eric Holder? He refused to prosecute the Black Panther intimidation case, openly admitting he was dismissing it because they were black. You liberals need to understand that you can't win by calling every non-liberal a racist/bigot. People are smarter than that. Sessions is neither a racist nor a bigot, and outside of the progressive echo chamber no one thinks he is. In fact, the whole concept of racist/bigot has been so diluted. You're a racist if you believe in tax reform. You're a racist if you didn't vote for white Hillary Clinton. Somehow Clarence Thomas was racist against Obama even though Clarence Thomas is twice as black. It has lost all meaning. We are all individuals. The concept of race has become political, not based on skin color. In fact, somehow people are racist by proxy if another racist likes them. Trump gets dinged because the KKK likes him? He can't help that. Why wasn't Obama dinged when Farrakhan liked him? The double-standard on race has also diluted its meaning. Ten years ago, racism was a serious accusation.

Your average third grader isn't too bright and is small to boot. They still have baby fat for the most part. You can outreach them and hit harder as well, plus as an adult, you'll have more tolerance to pain and a more strategic manner of thinking.\n\nI'd find a long implement such as a broom, stick, halberd, etc, to enable me to make sweeping attacks at range. The next priority would be finding a defensible location. You want the fewest sides exposed as possible. In a pinch, a corner might work, but if you can find a ledge that the children can't climb up onto, you'll be free to rain death from above.  \n\nAs you destroy or critically wound their comrades, the remaining 3rd-graders will begin to lose morale and their attack strength will sputter off. Then you can swoop down from the ledge like Batman and finally culminate your annihilation.  \n\nEdit: obligatory gold editing ahoy. I am glad you all like this post enough to gild it, but more importantly, I hope you will take my tactical advice to heart such that when the inevitable third grader rebellion occurs, you shall know what must be done.  Total warfare; show no mercy!

Even without any real tactics. 3rd graders go down ridiculously easy and they deal almost no real damage. It's really about stamina, not getting beat up by kids. One tactic that might work is getting on a slide or something and resting on the top step while I kick them in the face as they try to climb up.

An easy are to take a short break and rest. \n\nWeapons would be difficult to find on a playground, so because of my height and the obvious danger of kicking, my best chance of taking kids out would be using environmental things. Monkey bars would be bitchin too, the only way to reach me would be to climb, and again with the strength advantage, I could toss them off easily without much energy while I basically sit and rest. I think I'd spend a lot of time on the slide shoving kids off until there were just SO many of them that they could push the slide over. Fortunately for me, that would take a lot of kids. So I'd basically have killed, maimed, or injured very, VERY many of them by tossing them off the highest point of the slide. \n\n\nSame event as above, but with no slides/jungle gyms/environmental things.

One of the most effective ways to do this is by paraphrasing what they say and repeating it back.\n\nWhen therapists used reflective listening, people were likely to disclose more emotion and have a much better therapeutic relationship with the therapist. This easily transfers over to talking to your friends.\n\nIf you listen to what they say, and rephrase it as a question to confirm that you understood it, they are going to be more comfortable talking with you. They are also going to have a better friendship with you and be more likely to listen to what you have to say, because you showed that you care about them.

Does it compare to the size of your computer? Trash bin? A fucking car? Next, What's the color of the cube? Now, if you shine a light to the cube, does all of the light pass through? Some light? Or none at all?? \n\nNext, a ladder appears by the cube, how is it positioned? Is it leaning on the cube? Is the cube sitting on it? Surprise me! \n\nNext, a horse appears. Tell me everything about the horse, what it looks like, what is it doing, and its personality.\n\n\nFinally, flowers would appear everywhere. How many are there? Where did it appear? How big is the flower?\n\nEND\n\nThe explanations: if i cant explain it immediately, send a pm\n\nThe Cube represents you.

If it is floating, then you're still not sure about it, but hey, you're willing to try something new. If neither, send me a pm and i'll tell you ;). Now, the size of the cube represents your ego. Bigger the cube means bigger ego or overconfident, smaller it is, the smaller you ego is. The color of the cube is your personality, red is violent, green is comfortable, blue is mellow. Neither, then send a pm. If the light passes through, then you can be emotionally be read. If none, then you're pretty hard to read but also hard for you to convey emotions deeply. \n\nThe Ladder represents family, if the ladder is leaning on the cube then you feel supported by your family. Side by side, then you are pretty tight with them. If the ladder is a bit far away then you are distanced from your family. \n\nThe Horse represents your ideal partner or your crush. What ever personality/looks then that is your answer, if not send a pm.\n\nLastly, the flowers represents your problems. How many and where(pops up by the cube, ladder, horse) then you have sa problem with that and how big it is then that is how much it is bothering you.\n\n\nNotes: if you ever use this, <b> BE RESPONSIBLE <b>.

Note that this might take a while so you better be charming(after doing this, you're going to be) and hope they pay attention very well (works best if they're a bit tipsy since drunks have their senses heightened and explains their answers vividly) and requires you to do a bit of adlib.\n\nHow to do it: i'll do it to you to first ;) and i'll explain it at the bottom of this wall of text.\n\nImagine you are in a desert, maybe a plain field like the windows xp background. You can only see the ground and the sky. Now a cube suddenly appears. Does it appear floating? Out of thin air? Or did it popped up on the ground? Or just tell me how. Next, how big is it? Does it compare to the size of your computer? Trash bin? A fucking car? Next, What's the color of the cube? Now, if you shine a light to the cube, does all of the light pass through? Some light? Or none at all?? \n\nNext, a ladder appears by the cube, how is it positioned? Is it leaning on the cube? Is the cube sitting on it? Surprise me! \n\nNext, a horse appears. Tell me everything about the horse, what it looks like, what is it doing, and its personality.\n\n\nFinally, flowers would appear everywhere. How many are there? Where did it appear? How big is the flower?\n\nEND\n\nThe explanations: if i cant explain it immediately, send a pm\n\nThe Cube represents you. So if it pops up on the ground, it means you are grounded by your decisions and your stance in life. If it is floating, then you're still not sure about it, but hey, you're willing to try something new. If neither, send me a pm and i'll tell you ;). Now, the size of the cube represents your ego. Bigger the cube means bigger ego or overconfident, smaller it is, the smaller you ego is. The color of the cube is your personality, red is violent, green is comfortable, blue is mellow. Neither, then send a pm. If the light passes through, then you can be emotionally be read. If none, then you're pretty hard to read but also hard for you to convey emotions deeply. \n\nThe Ladder represents family, if the ladder is leaning on the cube then you feel supported by your family. Side by side, then you are pretty tight with them. If the ladder is a bit far away then you are distanced from your family. \n\nThe Horse represents your ideal partner or your crush. What ever personality/looks then that is your answer, if not send a pm.\n\nLastly, the flowers represents your problems. How many and where(pops up by the cube, ladder, horse) then you have sa problem with that and how big it is then that is how much it is bothering you.\n\n\nNotes: if you ever use this, <b> BE RESPONSIBLE <b>. I had someone broke down in front of me after this and it wasn't pretty. And I got lazy to this part because it is actually hard to explain how.\n\nCube: adlib on the colours, there's a colour = personality bs in the internet, use that.\n\nLadder: adlib if cannot be explained (I had someone answer that the ladder is perpendicular to the cube, had a doozy on that one)\n\nHorse: adlib \n\nFlowers: adlib adlib adlib.\n\nFinal note: don't abuse, just use.

That's the population of California, and they think they're just gone,\u201d said Kennedy, an associate professor of political science, according to the [university website](http://news.ku.edu/2016/11/22/study-finds-chinas-missing-girls-theory-likely-far-overblown).\n\n>\u201cMost people are using a demographic explanation to say that abortion or infanticide are the reasons they don't show up in the census and that they don't exist. But **we find there is a political explanation**.\u201d\n\n>**Local officials, they argue, were complicit in the concealment to retain support from villagers, and maintain social stability.**\n\n>...\u201cThere is no coordination between cadres saying 'we're all in agreement,'\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cActually it's just very local. The people who are implementing these policies work for the government in a sense. They are officials, but they are also villagers, and they have to live in the village where they are implementing policies.\u201d\n\n>...The pair apparently stumbled on their theory when interviewing a villager in China\u2019s northern Shaanxi province in 1996. **The man had two daughters and a son and referred to the younger daughter as \u201cthe nonexistent one**.\u201d\n\n>Further excerpts from the [study](http://news.ku.edu/2016/11/22/study-finds-chinas-missing-girls-theory-likely-far-overblown):\n\n>>\"The researchers believe local government officials informally worked with farmers and acknowledged that they couldn't fully enforce the one-child policy. Instead they made **tacit agreements in allowing families to have extra children in exchange for social stability in their communities.

Many times one of the two of you will change, and the other person says \"Hey, this is not the person I married!\"  And the marriage fails.  \n\nAnother reason why you should not marry too young is because you're only young once.  Once you marry, all sorts of stuff changes.  Chances are, you'll be more limited once you're married.  You have more responsibility.  If you want to have tons of sex, your 20s is the time to do it, while you are not married.  If you want to drive a motorcycle to sturgis, do so at 20, when you are unmarried.  Once you have all the crazy adventure out of your system, THEN settle down.  They call it settling down for a reason.

If you had to stop to rigorously analyze every single one, you would never get anything done.

The majority of these I've read from various sources (books or the internet). Approach these with a healthy dose of skepticism because I haven't put all of these into practice myself:\nMake it a point to remember people's names, and drop it out loud to them in conversation. People love hearing their own names and it makes you more personable (bonus points if you actually are personable). The trick is to be mindful of the 3-second window upon hearing their name that you have to retain it. Make up an imaginary connection that links their name to your memory: the more bizarre the better because that way you'll remember it. For example if his name is Peter, imagine him decked out in a green feathered cap and tights like disney peter pan. The more you add to the fantasy like him prancing up trying to fly, the easier it is to recall it the next time you see him.\nIf you're trying to negotiate with someone, rather than constantly push forward your side, stop talking. People hate silence and will do what they can to fill it, and in doing so they can be more likely to sway towards your favour.\nThe Ben Franklin effect states that by asking someone to do a favour for you, it makes it more likely they'll do you another favour in the future than if it was you giving the initial favour. Sounds strange but it brings to mind the mindset behind the main character in the novel Choke.\nDerren Brown incorporates a facial tic of frequent tiny nods of the head while he talks to people.

It was somewhere around January, I asked out this hot ting. She wasn't too bright, but I wasn't looking for too much. The first class of the day was Chemistry, a subject I was none too fond of. I walked in a bit late,  and I saw her seat was across my assigned seat. We talk, I make some crass Chem humor which she giggles at. As we are the table is empty and hides our kegs pretty well, the conversation quickly turns sexual. She starts brushing her legs against mine (she's wearing a skirt, I'm wearing gym shorts) and looks me straight in my face with a the \"I could do anything now\" eyes. The chem teacher notices our intense gaze and asks me to stand up and explain the topic she was teaching. I waste a couple seconds with the \"Who? Me?\" so Johnny goes soft. I pretty much explain it and she sends me back. As I sit down the girl tells me to meet her in the gym bathrooms, and then she asks to go to the nurse. Now my dick is pulsating with anticipation. As class ends, I walk through the hallway leading to the gym and the (becomes relevant ate on) asking if he's seen my gf. Unwilling to delay my surprise, I tell him no.  As I enter the gym bathrooms, my balls are tingling like bells. I turn to the changing rooms and a hand suddenly pulls me into one of them. It's the girl, now with light pink lipstick and a black choker (god I love chokers). We start making out heavily, then she slowly bends down to her knees, all the while her eyes are locked to mine. I'm already solid. She slowly pulls down my shorts, then my boxers, and (don't judge me) nibbles on my chode. I can barely stand up. She starts rocking her head ever so slightly, while her sexy spit greases my cock to perfection. She starts amping it up, and then she does this amazing move. She actually sucks, like **sucks**, my dick so ,so hard, like you would after eating something sour. My nut-contractions are iminent. I ask her the customary  \"where do you want it?\" and she circles all over her face. I pull my dick out of her mouth and shoot my seed all over her forehead. I compliment her thoroughly, and then excuse myself (for a legit reason) as I have a very important class I'm missing. She understands, and I leave. Fast forward 2 hours and I find the girl is crying. Now I'm worried. I ask her what's  wrong and it turns out that her brother had wanted to tell her that her dog had died. I sigh in relief and try to offer some condolences. As I step out of the class, one of the counselors pulls up and she tells me that I shouldn't have made her cry. My face creases. She repeats the statement. \"What do you mean?\", I ask her. You forced her to...she pauses... **pleasure** you and  now she's crying. I looked at her for a couple of seconds, silent, to emphasize my innocence. \"I saw the white...on her sweater\" she says. I tell her my gf was crying because of the dog but she doesn't want to hear it. Since she saw cum on my gf's black sweater, she is convinced it is because I made her give me toppy. She calls my gf and asks her why she is crying. She says it's because of her dog. Now the counselor thinks I told my gf to tell her that excuse. Long story short, I tell her yes, giving head is the reason why my gf was crying because the counselor threatened to call our parents if I didn't admit to it. \n\nSkeeted on my bish 4head, some dropped on the top, got caught."]], [[{"comment": "When I almost got suspended for pointing a laser pointer at my friend in High School.

It was somewhere around January, I asked out this hot ting. She wasn't too bright, but I wasn't looking for too much. The first class of the day was Chemistry, a subject I was none too fond of. I walked in a bit late,  and I saw her seat was across my assigned seat. We talk, I make some crass Chem humor which she giggles at. As we are the table is empty and hides our kegs pretty well, the conversation quickly turns sexual. She starts brushing her legs against mine (she's wearing a skirt, I'm wearing gym shorts) and looks me straight in my face with a the \"I could do anything now\" eyes. The chem teacher notices our intense gaze and asks me to stand up and explain the topic she was teaching. I waste a couple seconds with the \"Who? Me?\" so Johnny goes soft. I pretty much explain it and she sends me back. As I sit down the girl tells me to meet her in the gym bathrooms, and then she asks to go to the nurse. Now my dick is pulsating with anticipation. As class ends, I walk through the hallway leading to the gym and the (becomes relevant ate on) asking if he's seen my gf. Unwilling to delay my surprise, I tell him no.  As I enter the gym bathrooms, my balls are tingling like bells. I turn to the changing rooms and a hand suddenly pulls me into one of them. It's the girl, now with light pink lipstick and a black choker (god I love chokers). We start making out heavily, then she slowly bends down to her knees, all the while her eyes are locked to mine. I'm already solid. She slowly pulls down my shorts, then my boxers, and (don't judge me) nibbles on my chode. I can barely stand up. She starts rocking her head ever so slightly, while her sexy spit greases my cock to perfection. She starts amping it up, and then she does this amazing move. She actually sucks, like **sucks**, my dick so ,so hard, like you would after eating something sour. My nut-contractions are iminent. I ask her the customary  \"where do you want it?\" and she circles all over her face. I pull my dick out of her mouth and shoot my seed all over her forehead. I compliment her thoroughly, and then excuse myself (for a legit reason) as I have a very important class I'm missing. She understands, and I leave. Fast forward 2 hours and I find the girl is crying. Now I'm worried. I ask her what's  wrong and it turns out that her brother had wanted to tell her that her dog had died. I sigh in relief and try to offer some condolences. As I step out of the class, one of the counselors pulls up and she tells me that I shouldn't have made her cry. My face creases. She repeats the statement. \"What do you mean?\", I ask her. You forced her to...she pauses... **pleasure** you and  now she's crying. I looked at her for a couple of seconds, silent, to emphasize my innocence. \"I saw the white...on her sweater\" she says. I tell her my gf was crying because of the dog but she doesn't want to hear it. Since she saw cum on my gf's black sweater, she is convinced it is because I made her give me toppy. She calls my gf and asks her why she is crying. She says it's because of her dog. Now the counselor thinks I told my gf to tell her that excuse. Long story short, I tell her yes, giving head is the reason why my gf was crying because the counselor threatened to call our parents if I didn't admit to it. \n\nSkeeted on my bish 4head, some dropped on the top, got caught.", "id": "daqyzob"}, {"comment": "I don't think your Novelty account is working out boss.", "id": "dar535f"}]]], "5gci6d": ["What do you think makes someone instantly more attractive?", "2016-12-04 02:40:47", 22, "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5gci6d/what_do_you_think_makes_someone_instantly_more/", [[27, "Kindness."], [26, "When you realise they are intelligent.

Nobody else was too seriously injured. Prying that infant from the arms of his mother is a moment seared into my brain forever. I can put corpses on gurneys all day long. Pick skull fragments out of a wall, or collect limbs from the side of a freeway no problem.

It just felt wrong on the most primal level for me.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the support. I'm definitely no hero, and I'm totally fine, believe me. I drink a lot, but only at soccer games.

I didn't know whose vehicle it was at the time and found out to my dismay a few days after. He was drunk and running from the Sharifs Deputies.

Once they and pulled him from the wreck it seems they had started saving his life right there on the pile of garbage. He was packed and shipped to a bigger metro hospital.

The crimes I've cleaned up are of the DUI/Reckless driving variety. I've cleaned up death and gore. Mostly you try not to think about it and load the vehicle without getting inside it. Sometimes you make dark jokes to lighten the humanity of what you see. It's not that you enjoy it. Rather, it'll sicken you to think about it. It's given me nightmares. It is grotesque work that would make the most jaded Live Leaks junkie puke in shame. \nI've seen vehicles torn in half, families carted away in meat wagons, and animals (including a moose) writhing with broken limbs (that one actually sucks a little more). \nA few years ago I had the unfortunate task of cleaning up a wreck, literally fishing it out of the trees, of a guy I had worked with at a different company a few years prior. I didn't know whose vehicle it was at the time and found out to my dismay a few days after. He was drunk and running from the Sharifs Deputies. He had gotten his pick up going fast enough down a curvy road the the deputies had backed off. (Police edition Tahoes move very quickly.) He lost it off a curve and it crashed into some trees and was stuck there on its side and upside down about ~4 feet off the ground. They used the jaws of life to cut open the cab of his truck and snip the mounts of his seat to pull him out of where the rear window / C pillar used to be. Only because he was 30 seconds ahead of the LEOs and 5 minutes from a hospital with a helipad did he survive that night. The thing about a roll over is that all of the junk that is in your cab, all of the shit that has rolled under your seats over the years, all the shit in your cubbies hits the ground and we have to clean it up. On flat pavement this goes pretty quickly with a shovel and trash bags. Because this incident was in the grass and brush we were picking it up by gloved hand. Because the guy lived on the side of a mountain he carried spare blankets, sleeping bag and pillows in his truck in case was was ever stranded. All of that soft stuff became body sized tampons soaked in blood. It was the single bloodiest accident I've ever had to clean. In the course of cleaning we found all of the packaging of the medical equipment from the rescue. Once they and pulled him from the wreck it seems they had started saving his life right there on the pile of garbage. He was packed and shipped to a bigger metro hospital. They had assumed he would not live to stand trial so they never took blood or breath samples for evidence of intoxication. Word began to circle that he was dead. We weren't friends but we were friendly. This was a guy I had known. We were in different departments but he had helped me closely a few times before. He was a [snowcat driver](/r/snowcats) and I was a snowcat mechanic. \nAfter a month in ICU he pulled through. Six months or so after the accident he stopped taking his blood thinners either because he couldn't afford them or blew the money elsewhere. His blood clotted. The clot freed and delivered a massive heart attack. He died, twice. \n\nThinking about it now, typing this out, I'm shaking and feeling sick. Wear your seatbelt and don't run from the cops.

I wanted their rights secured, but after reading into it found out it's FAR more grey than imagined. \n\nFact ONE - The pipeline actually doesn't even get within a mile of the Indian reservation. Hell, in order to protest, you have to LEAVE the reservation to go off of the tribal land. That's why the case was thrown out of court in the first place; because it would be the equivalent to trying to control your neighbors landscaping.

As in, they're not negotiating to have the pipeline moved now, they're negotiating for millions of dollars. The case for the injunction was on terms that the offered cash wasn't enough. \n\nTHREE - The piping used is nonleaded, safe and standard pipeline used throughout the US.

She would invite me over to her place all the time and we'd watch cartoons together throughout middleschool. She was always kinda flirty and super nice with me. So one day as I'm leaving her place I say \"hold on. I have a present for you\", pull her towards me and kiss her. She goes \"omg\" and in a panic I left. I run home and I get a text from her best friend asking wtf did I just do because the girl was crying and calling her. I honestly felt disgusting. Like I was a rapist. Never felt so terrible about something that I did. \n\nEventually things went back to normal but man. Shit was so awkward for a while. I apologized to her on a weekly basis once we were back on friendly terms. \n\nAs for the other girl I thought she liked me too. But what I saw as flirting was actually just pity. So when I asked her out she said yes. After a week of us \"dating\" I eventually found out she had said yes to me because she cares about my feelings and didn't want to say no. She's an amazingly nice girl and I still talk to her a lot. But damn. To this day nothing has felt worse when it came to a relationship than when I found out she was actually dating my best friend. But like I said she was a super nice girl so I never really felt resentment towards her. \n\nBut damn if these two experiences haven't stopped me from being super cautious with girls. I've probably ignored a shit load of girls flirting with me and categorized it as them being nice. \n\nUnless a girl straight up says \"I like you\" I will most likely never notice. \n\nSadbois:(", "id": "dapkkto"}], [{"comment": "Invited me over to watch a movie as the parents were out that night, I chose to go to my rec soccer game.

That said, divorce and the end of relationships isn't always a product of bitterness and resentment; people can like one another and acknowledge a lack of compatibility. Hell, my parents have been married three and four times each and get along well with their former spouses except for each other-- my mom and my stepdad groupon their season theatre passes with my mom's first husband and his wife. I'm still friendly with all but one of my exes (with good reason) and don't look back at my time with them as mistakes. And in terms of a Honeymoon stage, I've been with my fianc\u00e9 for almost five years and things are definitely way more romantic than they were when we started dating, largely because we've bonded over difficult circumstances (living in the developing world, dealing with war-torn societies, each of us has had a potentially life-threatening illness) and have supported one another's goals and priorities from the get-go.\n\nAnyway, I don't believe you have a doctorate in psychology (if you did, you'd understand the difference between you're and your and would have a basic understanding of dopamine/oxytocin/norepinephrine and their role in love and bonding). Your writing patterns mirror those of my older students who are about university age, so I'm going to assume you're a guy in your early twenties who is struggling socially and is trying to make sense of other people's perceived ease in that arena (it happens, I've been there, most people are there at some time or another). So here's a little advice: I know dating can appear difficult when you don't perceive yourself to be as socially adept as your peers, and it's easy to become frustrated and decide that you're somehow superior and that their success is short-lived and based on a stupidity that you don't believe yourself to possess, and it can be difficult to understand nuance when your experience is limited, as yours very clearly is. In these times, it's important to look into yourself rather than direct your bitterness outward. Instead of resenting women for not wanting to date you, try to focus on developing skills and hobbies that have a social component without fixating on trying to make a romantic/sexual connection at first. In developing your own character, you'll be a lot less unhappy and will become the kind of person people will want to be around (because even though you believe yourself to be more intelligent than those around you, people can smell bitterness on you and will want to steer clear). You're young, so good luck, you have time to improve your outlook. :)\n\nEdit: a word", "id": "dar9gb9"}], [{"comment": "The fist-bump we do when we encounter screaming and obnoxious children.

I decided to go dive the cave with my buddy, since we'd done it earlier that day when conditions were great. We didnt lay a line either (huge no-no) because there was a pipe along the floor of the cave, which we saw on our previous trip. We assumed this pipe began at the entrance and went straight back into the end of the cave (the owners installed it as a water vacuum to help clean the deepest parts of this cave). This day there had been a high volume of students diving the cavern (the large, open, beginning portion of the cave) which had churned up the silt till you could barely see. This is crucial, because the cavern portion is where you just \"swim towards sunlight\" on a normal dive. To add to our fuckup we dove in the evening, not realizing that the sun would have set when we were heading out. We began the dive confidently, trusting our misguided failsafe, and swam to the cavern. Both of us noticed how silty it now was, but figured \"hey, you can still see the surface\" thanks to the sun, and continue towards the cave. Once inside we swam down to the end of the cave (about 200' back), turned around, and began to exit. The closer we got to the exit, the worse the visibility got, and by the time we noticed the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" wasnt coming, the vis was barely two feet. Undeterred, we grabbed on to the pipe and followed, hand over hand, to where (we assumed) the pipe would breach the surface, crawling along foot by foot, holding on to a pvc pipe on the floor. This was the point we hit a wall. Literally. This pipe, which we had assumed led to the surface, instead made a bend to a shallower passage of the cave where it entered the ceiling and disappeared. In the terrible vis, we followed it into a passage we'd never seen before, in a part of the cave that was a complete dead end. Ill never forget the feeling of dread and panic that hit me, but the most memorable moment was making eye contact with my buddy as we both realized we were going to die. Most accidental deaths are instantaneous, but in cave diving you have the time to contemplate your fate as you watch your air pressure needle drop, and as panic started to set in, my air needle started moving towards zero. So we fought. Survival instinct set in, we refused to wait and drown, and instead started crawling, in near zero vis, over every part of that cave to find the exit. If you watch the video below, you'll notice there is a sign at the entrance warning people of the dangers of cave diving. It is ironic, but this sign saved our lives, as it's oriented to face the entrance, a fact my buddy remembered, and gave us a point to try and blindly shoot towards the pitch black surface.\n\nNo surprise, it worked- we lived. And, one month later I \"got back on the horse\"- got cave certified, called a lucky idiot by my cave instructor, and learned to never make the same mistake twice.\n\nA video (not me) of the dive site: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cOto7MC3TQg\n\nPic of me diving the cave a month later (trained and properly equipped this time): http://m.imgur.com/xFANhcG\n"], [15, "It's always scary when someone your diving with disappears for a few moments. \n\nWhen you're in a crowd it's easy to lose someone - imagine how weird it is to lose someone you were literally a meter behind when there's nothing else around you except a few coral bommys or whatever.\n\nI have also had a couple of occasions where I've gone for a dive and within 4 or 5 minutes of being underwater felt extremely nauseous and with a massive headache.

Noticed what I thought was a grey reef shark ~60'   below me which I'm perfectly comfortable around.  It started swimming upwards in circles towards me.  At first I thought, to myself, \"wow, that's a larger reef shark,\" but as it continued ascending to about 30' below me me I instantly recognized the rounded/flat snout and striped pattern on it's back.  My heart rate quickened and breathing increased as I realized it was a 12' tiger shark that was curious about me and continued ascending in a wide spiral at me.  I immediately attempted to hail my boat captain who was 150 yards off using the \"shark\" and \"come get me\" hand signals, but he thought I was just waving and having fun watching dolphins (that were no longer within my view).  In the back of my mind I thought, \"Worst case scenario, maybe the dolphins will come and save me.\"  As my boat captain was unresponsive, and level of risk as exaggerated in my mind (since I'd never seen a tiger shark IRL), I realized that I would have to swim to swim to the boat.  Swimming freestyle (with fins) I would take a few strokes and look down and back to keep my eyes on the shark.  After doing this 3 or 4 times, the shark had reached the surface and was swimming parallel with me towards the boat about 20' to my right. I even saw it's dorsal fin breach the water.  Then, as a result of the moderate chop and surface turbidity, I lost sight of the fish.  Not knowing where it was freaked me out even more now, and I broke into a full sprint towards the boat, no longer trying to keep my eyes peeled for it.

I decided to go dive the cave with my buddy, since we'd done it earlier that day when conditions were great. We didnt lay a line either (huge no-no) because there was a pipe along the floor of the cave, which we saw on our previous trip. We assumed this pipe began at the entrance and went straight back into the end of the cave (the owners installed it as a water vacuum to help clean the deepest parts of this cave). This day there had been a high volume of students diving the cavern (the large, open, beginning portion of the cave) which had churned up the silt till you could barely see. This is crucial, because the cavern portion is where you just \"swim towards sunlight\" on a normal dive. To add to our fuckup we dove in the evening, not realizing that the sun would have set when we were heading out. We began the dive confidently, trusting our misguided failsafe, and swam to the cavern. Both of us noticed how silty it now was, but figured \"hey, you can still see the surface\" thanks to the sun, and continue towards the cave. Once inside we swam down to the end of the cave (about 200' back), turned around, and began to exit. The closer we got to the exit, the worse the visibility got, and by the time we noticed the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" wasnt coming, the vis was barely two feet. Undeterred, we grabbed on to the pipe and followed, hand over hand, to where (we assumed) the pipe would breach the surface, crawling along foot by foot, holding on to a pvc pipe on the floor. This was the point we hit a wall. Literally. This pipe, which we had assumed led to the surface, instead made a bend to a shallower passage of the cave where it entered the ceiling and disappeared. In the terrible vis, we followed it into a passage we'd never seen before, in a part of the cave that was a complete dead end. Ill never forget the feeling of dread and panic that hit me, but the most memorable moment was making eye contact with my buddy as we both realized we were going to die. Most accidental deaths are instantaneous, but in cave diving you have the time to contemplate your fate as you watch your air pressure needle drop, and as panic started to set in, my air needle started moving towards zero. So we fought. Survival instinct set in, we refused to wait and drown, and instead started crawling, in near zero vis, over every part of that cave to find the exit. If you watch the video below, you'll notice there is a sign at the entrance warning people of the dangers of cave diving. It is ironic, but this sign saved our lives, as it's oriented to face the entrance, a fact my buddy remembered, and gave us a point to try and blindly shoot towards the pitch black surface.\n\nNo surprise, it worked- we lived.

Amazing.\n\nSlowly it feels like we have gone off course a bit, now there is just sand, no underwater features or reefs, so we all decide to surface. Our dive master looks around and loudly says 'thats not our boat is it?!' Pointing to a boat more than two miles out to sea. The water is pretty choppy and seeing our very experienced dive master sound increasingly worried was terrifying. \n\nI reckon we were bobbing around for five minutes or so before we realise our boat was less than 100 metres away disguised by the lights from the island. 10 out of 10 will night dive again!\n", "id": "dar8j6e"}], [{"comment": "Was diving once in ontario, not with a tank or anything just kinda hyper breathing to get myself to hold my breath longer, i came up underneath a dock.. dock spiders... fucking everywhere ... and i had to sit there until i oxygenated my ass properly before slowly dipping down and everytime id try opening my mouth to breath theyd try climbing in there", "id": "dar9fqk"}], [{"comment": "Panic attack on a night dive", "id": "dar6jpy"}], [{"comment": "Freediver here. We don't weight ourselves the same as SCUBA divers or even breath-hold spearfishers.\n\nSCUBA divers are always weighted so they are neutrally buoyant at their present depth, more or less.

Breath-hold spearfishers typically weight themselves so they are neutrally buoyant at or slightly below their operating depth, so they will tend to float.\n\nFreedivers weight themselves so they are neutrally buoyant at 10m or at one third of their operating depth, typically, but there are factors that can change that.\n\nSo for me, the scariest thing to happen underwater was one of my first dives, where I was below neutral buoyancy and I peeked over a edge to find that was that the bottom was over a mile down.

Im not talking on a lake with a hobie cat or sunfish. Im taking about sailing on the ocean in a real sailboat.\n\nIf not, take some classes. The American Sailing Association offers certification programs in all aspects of sailing, from day sailing to offshore bluewater sailing. \n\nThe certificate alone is just the door opener. You will still need experience and that takes time. Take a sailboat on a cruise. Go for a weeks vacation on a rental. Do some open water sailing in the caribbean and it will give you a small taste of what blue water sailing is like.\n\nThink you are ready for more? Partner up with a program like Sail OPO. They will take you on a sail from Newport to Bermuda or Bermuda to the Caribbean. 5-14 days on the open ocean. Nothing but you and some other folks on a boat with nothing but water all around.\n\nOnce experienced enough, do some boat relocations with OPO. They will hook you up with boats that need crew to be relocated all around the world.\n\nFinally ready to do an Atlantic Crossing? Join up with the ARC rally and sail from Spain to the Caribbean. 3-4 weeks crossing with other sailboats in the short window in November.\n\nThis is not something you are going to learn over night or reading a book.

They were only about two short blocks from one another, and due to that, I didn't take the move very seriously nor plan it out well.\n\nI rented a small truck from Uhaul to get most of the big furniture from the old place to the new over the weekend, but didn't finish getting all the smaller stuff. So over the course of the next couple days I was slowly moving a few small items and boxes from my old place to my new just by tossing them into the back of my car.\n\nOn the very last night that I had to get the remaining things out of my old place there remained two bookshelves and a bunch of hats. The bookshelves wouldn't fit into my car without disassembling them. They were easy enough to disassemble since they were from Ikea, but the last thing I wanted to do at the time was disassemble them, move them two blocks and reassemble them. However, they were also really light. They were made of aluminum and were less than 10 pounds each. So I decided I could just carry them to my new place. As for the hats, I had run out of boxes for such miscellaneous junk, but I figured, they were hats, I could wear them. So that evening, at around midnight, I carried two bookshelves, one on each shoulder, and about 10 hats stacked carefully on top of my head the two blocks from my old place to my new one. It was late and dark out, and I probably cut a pretty odd looking silhouette from a distance, what with two large objects on my shoulders and what probably would've looked like a very elongated head.\n\nWhile carrying the stuff to my new place, about a block ahead of me there was someone walking. I was walking right down the middle of the street. I saw them stop, look at me, and just turn around and start to walk the other way.\n\nAnyway, I always think of that incident whenever I hear the phrase \"wear many hats\".", "id": "dapi125"}, {"comment": "This is the most innocently hilarious thing I've read all day.", "id": "dapnols"}, {"comment": "Or that you're trying to become a clothing model.", "id": "dapexon"}], [{"comment": "Lack of safety regulations.

No one doubted me because I enjoy cycling and the place where I live has shitty traffic. No, I am not an asshole cyclist, I follow the rules. Bike lanes were installed a few years back, so thankfully I don't ride in traffic anymore. Before that I've been hit by a car, a van, a taxi and almost by bus. But those stories are for another time.\n\nAnyhow. The truth is that I tried to jump off a building. Not for fun. I wanted to kill myself. It was a long time ago. College freshman year. It was that time of the year when the summer warmth fades away and you feel the cold in the weather and sense something's wrong with your life. I had just broken up with my first real girlfriend. In retrospect, she was a crazy, manipluative psycho. No, not in that cute way people talk about their hated ex. She was a few years older than me and she was like... get-that-virgin-boy-drunk-and-rape-him, use-that-guilt-to-have-him-around, distance-him-from-his-friends-and-family, i-am-pregnant-lol-just-joking kind of crazy. Oh, you can't begin to imagine how much I loved her! My very special first! But the stories about her are for another time. \n\nI was at the peak of my depression. Not everything was about the girl though. I just didn't know what to do with my life. I was a very confused human being. Still am. It was night time when I took the stairs up to the rooftop of the building where I lived. At first, I went up there to breathe. I needed some fresh air. Gazed at the moon. It was meh. City lights caught my attention, for a while. Then, suddenly everything made perfect sense. I pushed myself up on the ledge of the building. I sat there with my feet dangling above the ground. Then I stood up. A step forward and it would be over. No more worries. It all made sense. I took the step. Left foot. Then, I died. Sorry, I lied. I didn't die. As soon my foot was hovering in the air, bewitched conscience that was my brain woke up. What the fuck was I doing! Survival instincts kicked in. My arms latched on to the edge of the building. If I let go, I fall. If I fall, I die. And I would be a terrible inconvenience for the street cleaners who usually come at dawn. Nobody likes to clean a red splat. That's an asshole move on my part. I didn't want that. I didn't want to die and be an asshole. This strange strain of logic helped me back on the roof. It didn't help much with my depression though. Or should I say it helped in a way that taught me I was not the suicide kind of depressed? It doesn't really matter because that incident didn't really cure my depression nor did I seek help after that. I lied to myself that I was okay. That I was not depressed anymore. I suffered and lived through it for nearly a decade until recently. Finally, I was able to change my mind. But the story is about my scar not my depression, so another time.\n\nWhen I was in the process of pulling myself up, the sharp edged ledge cut deep through my skin. It's kind of obvious if you consider the fact that I was pulling my entire body up. I bled out quite a lot. Stupid me didn't go to the hospital. The wound got infected, swollen, and left a relatively cute scar on my arm. Small enough to blame a mild traffic accident, big enough to remind me of the time I almost killed myself. Never told anyone the truth until now. You're my first!\n\np.s. Sorry for the lousy writing. Been awake for 2 days now. No filter. No decency.\n\ntl;dr : I tried jumping of a building to kill myself.

No one doubted me because I enjoy cycling and the place where I live has shitty traffic. No, I am not an asshole cyclist, I follow the rules. Bike lanes were installed a few years back, so thankfully I don't ride in traffic anymore. Before that I've been hit by a car, a van, a taxi and almost by bus. But those stories are for another time.\n\nAnyhow. The truth is that I tried to jump off a building. Not for fun. I wanted to kill myself. It was a long time ago. College freshman year. It was that time of the year when the summer warmth fades away and you feel the cold in the weather and sense something's wrong with your life. I had just broken up with my first real girlfriend. In retrospect, she was a crazy, manipluative psycho. No, not in that cute way people talk about their hated ex. She was a few years older than me and she was like... get-that-virgin-boy-drunk-and-rape-him, use-that-guilt-to-have-him-around, distance-him-from-his-friends-and-family, i-am-pregnant-lol-just-joking kind of crazy. Oh, you can't begin to imagine how much I loved her! My very special first! But the stories about her are for another time. \n\nI was at the peak of my depression. Not everything was about the girl though. I just didn't know what to do with my life. I was a very confused human being. Still am. It was night time when I took the stairs up to the rooftop of the building where I lived. At first, I went up there to breathe. I needed some fresh air. Gazed at the moon. It was meh. City lights caught my attention, for a while. Then, suddenly everything made perfect sense. I pushed myself up on the ledge of the building. I sat there with my feet dangling above the ground. Then I stood up. A step forward and it would be over. No more worries. It all made sense. I took the step. Left foot. Then, I died. Sorry, I lied. I didn't die. As soon my foot was hovering in the air, bewitched conscience that was my brain woke up. What the fuck was I doing! Survival instincts kicked in. My arms latched on to the edge of the building. If I let go, I fall. If I fall, I die. And I would be a terrible inconvenience for the street cleaners who usually come at dawn. Nobody likes to clean a red splat. That's an asshole move on my part. I didn't want that. I didn't want to die and be an asshole. This strange strain of logic helped me back on the roof. It didn't help much with my depression though. Or should I say it helped in a way that taught me I was not the suicide kind of depressed? It doesn't really matter because that incident didn't really cure my depression nor did I seek help after that. I lied to myself that I was okay. That I was not depressed anymore. I suffered and lived through it for nearly a decade until recently. Finally, I was able to change my mind. But the story is about my scar not my depression, so another time.\n\nWhen I was in the process of pulling myself up, the sharp edged ledge cut deep through my skin. It's kind of obvious if you consider the fact that I was pulling my entire body up. I bled out quite a lot. Stupid me didn't go to the hospital. The wound got infected, swollen, and left a relatively cute scar on my arm. Small enough to blame a mild traffic accident, big enough to remind me of the time I almost killed myself. Never told anyone the truth until now. You're my first!\n\np.s. Sorry for the lousy writing. Been awake for 2 days now. No filter. No decency.\n\ntl;dr : I tried jumping of a building to kill myself.

Some examples include:\n \n(DISCLAIMER: This is all based off of what I imagine would happen. I may be wrong about any of this being possible/effective.) \n\n- Telekinesis, basically. Use strong enough wind, and you're launching people/objects around with no problem. Plus, by using air resistance to your advantage, you should be able to slow down or stop just about any projectile. This bullet point alone counters most potential enemies.\n\n- Immunity to drowning and falling, because of simply taking air from the surface to you and through air resistance to gradually slow yourself down, respectively.\n\n- Changing the composition and temperature of the air. Most of the time, waterbenders can use ice and steam, so why wouldn't an airbender be able to cool nitrogen in the air around somebody and coat them in liquid nitrogen? Plus, you could just straight-up create a vacuum and suffocate somebody, or negate fire-based abilities. (Alternatively, you could allow the air to rush back into the vacuum, which would probably hurt.)\n\n- Sound wave manipulation.\n\n- A giant wind force field would be surprisingly effective. Very little would be able to break through it implying the wind is going fast enough. Plus, you could potentially force other people out of their impenetrable force fields, by moving all the air in the force field to one spot or just right out of it, forcing them to either drop the shield or suffocate.\n\n- Increased strength and speed. The wind would ALWAYS be blowing in a direction that would be good for you, potentially allowing you to run faster and punch harder.\n\n- You could instantly kill people from almost any distance in a variety of different ways. A sudden and very powerful gust of wind to break an enemy's bones, throwing them at a wall, throwing a wall at them, dousing them in liquid nitrogen, dousing them in liquid oxygen and then setting them on fire, burning them with plasma, snapping their neck, exploding their lungs, suffocating them, etc. \n\nAnd that's only a few of the things an airbender could theoretically do. The vast majority of enemies would be stopped by the wind force field or very large amounts of drag, while almost anybody that could kill you, you could kill first. Anything short of a reality/probability bender or MAYBE a timebender would be screwed.\n\n- Earthbenders would be easy to take out, implying you're above the ground. Just kick up the wind force field high enough, and the rocks will be deflected and/or destroyed before they reach you.\n\n- Waterbenders could be more tough, due to the ability to bloodbend and/or remove the body's moisture, but you could snap the neck or explode the head of them before they could do much to you, if all goes well. And if that won't work, simply throw them around so they can't focus on you, while also killing them through physical trauma. Nothing else in their arsenal would be dangerous, since a wind force field cancels out most water-based attacks. (You may want to remove the water vapor from the air, though)\n\n- Firebenders seem dangerous until you realize you could just remove the oxygen (or all the air) from an area and render them useless, since fire requires oxygen to burn. In the unlikely event that their fire continues burning for some reason, simply blast them with a powerful wind and hope that, even if it doesn't put out the fire, it will at least break a bone or two/throw the enemy into a wall.\n\n- Electricity manipulation could be stopped through insulation or otherwise redirecting the electricity via air. Probably.\n\n- Teleportation is pretty useless if someone can kill you regardless of where you are.\n\n- Mind reading is pretty useless if you could be killed practically instantly.\n\n- Timebending is the dangerous one. But, if you simply move all the oxygen to somewhere where the enemy can't reach it, they'll be screwed. Even if they were to stop time, from what I can tell people still need to breathe in stopped time. So they'd suffocate either way.

The sheer amount of things you could do with it would be insane. Some examples include:\n \n(DISCLAIMER: This is all based off of what I imagine would happen. I may be wrong about any of this being possible/effective.) \n\n- Telekinesis, basically. Use strong enough wind, and you're launching people/objects around with no problem. Plus, by using air resistance to your advantage, you should be able to slow down or stop just about any projectile. This bullet point alone counters most potential enemies.\n\n- Immunity to drowning and falling, because of simply taking air from the surface to you and through air resistance to gradually slow yourself down, respectively.\n\n- Changing the composition and temperature of the air. Most of the time, waterbenders can use ice and steam, so why wouldn't an airbender be able to cool nitrogen in the air around somebody and coat them in liquid nitrogen? Plus, you could just straight-up create a vacuum and suffocate somebody, or negate fire-based abilities. (Alternatively, you could allow the air to rush back into the vacuum, which would probably hurt.)\n\n- Sound wave manipulation.\n\n- A giant wind force field would be surprisingly effective. Very little would be able to break through it implying the wind is going fast enough. Plus, you could potentially force other people out of their impenetrable force fields, by moving all the air in the force field to one spot or just right out of it, forcing them to either drop the shield or suffocate.\n\n- Increased strength and speed. The wind would ALWAYS be blowing in a direction that would be good for you, potentially allowing you to run faster and punch harder.\n\n- You could instantly kill people from almost any distance in a variety of different ways. A sudden and very powerful gust of wind to break an enemy's bones, throwing them at a wall, throwing a wall at them, dousing them in liquid nitrogen, dousing them in liquid oxygen and then setting them on fire, burning them with plasma, snapping their neck, exploding their lungs, suffocating them, etc. \n\nAnd that's only a few of the things an airbender could theoretically do. The vast majority of enemies would be stopped by the wind force field or very large amounts of drag, while almost anybody that could kill you, you could kill first. Anything short of a reality/probability bender or MAYBE a timebender would be screwed.\n\n- Earthbenders would be easy to take out, implying you're above the ground. Just kick up the wind force field high enough, and the rocks will be deflected and/or destroyed before they reach you.\n\n- Waterbenders could be more tough, due to the ability to bloodbend and/or remove the body's moisture, but you could snap the neck or explode the head of them before they could do much to you, if all goes well. And if that won't work, simply throw them around so they can't focus on you, while also killing them through physical trauma. Nothing else in their arsenal would be dangerous, since a wind force field cancels out most water-based attacks. (You may want to remove the water vapor from the air, though)\n\n- Firebenders seem dangerous until you realize you could just remove the oxygen (or all the air) from an area and render them useless, since fire requires oxygen to burn. In the unlikely event that their fire continues burning for some reason, simply blast them with a powerful wind and hope that, even if it doesn't put out the fire, it will at least break a bone or two/throw the enemy into a wall.\n\n- Electricity manipulation could be stopped through insulation or otherwise redirecting the electricity via air. Probably.\n\n- Teleportation is pretty useless if someone can kill you regardless of where you are.\n\n- Mind reading is pretty useless if you could be killed practically instantly.\n\n- Timebending is the dangerous one. But, if you simply move all the oxygen to somewhere where the enemy can't reach it, they'll be screwed. Even if they were to stop time, from what I can tell people still need to breathe in stopped time. So they'd suffocate either way.

How would *you* react to that if someone did it to you? Would you still see them as being a likely source of unbiased information? Someone worth having a conversation with?\n\nSo here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to give you that freebie. I'm going to guess that you've had bad experiences before.

And when I'm on the clock, then yes, I will let you tell me for hours about how your life is the worst life ever and no-one else's could possibly compare.

Didn't have the exact same life experiences? Even if they have never actually said anything against what was originally brought up? Is that the direction this thread's going to go?\n\nAnd, well, if it does, it won't be the first I've seen do so. Or the thousandth, or even the ten thousandth.

I have a personal theory the \"alternate versions\" are actually the originals. Diary of a Dope Fiend, the Dope Hat remix from Smells Like Children also is better than the original. Additionally, the Slipknot remixes of The Fight Song and Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin-Geddon (Holy Wood and The High End of Low tracks respectively). \n\nThe Type O Remix of Rammstein's Mann Gegen Mann. There's a few, like the piano version of Mein Herz Brennt that are radically different and not so much better as entirely awesome alternate approaches to the material. \nAlso, the pomDeter mashup of Amerika with Manson's We're From America is heavenly. \n\nGuns By Computer, the first track off of Nine Inch Nails' Year Zero Remixed. My best friend loves the entire album but that's the only YZR track I think is an improvement. It's HYPERPOWER! with lyrics from Saul Williams. Despite the absolutely absurd number of NIN remixes I generally prefer the original tracks. Not really a remix but the live version of Hurt with David Bowie is INFUCKINGCREDIBLE. All songs improve with Bowie. I wish he did a studio version to make a mashup of it with Trent's and Johnny Cash's.", "id": "daquie1"}, {"comment": "> Not really a remix but the live version of Hurt with David Bowie is INFUCKINGCREDIBLE.
