What's the benefit of the thinnest laptop ever, touting the virtues of portability when EVERY single thing plugged into this will be an adapter? What are the virtues of that in terms of portability?\n\nI watched the event. At first I was skeptical about the touch bar. Seemed unnecessary given that it was replacing the F keys and I preferred the tactile keys for those functions. Why add two button presses where only one existed before? I was then convinced by the idea that the main keys (volume, brightness, etc.) will be on top and can be adjusted with a press/swipe. Ok. I'll buy that.\n\nBut, fuck. You've gone too far on ports, Apple. As I sit here, there are two adapters plugged into my laptop, plus a hard drive, plus an HDMI port used, and I used the SD card slot and the second USB port for adding content from my CF card to the HDD it was also plugged into. Not to mention a keyboard and mouse through Bluetooth. You've dropped this from six ports to four. And one of those four will be charging he laptop. Unless, of course, I get yet another adapter to allow a port to act as both port and charger. This is a pro computer, so you say. As such, this is not enough for the heavy users. We use direct connections. We connect to multiple monitors. We need extra HDD space to access files. Your choices make being effective at a job more difficult.\n\nModularity is fine, when it serves a genuine purpose. Saving 3mm is not one of those purposes. Telling me a laptop is 20% lighter at this point tells me you've got less batteries in there. They're the heaviest part of the computer. Even if the new ones are more efficient, I bet if there were the same volume in there as before, they would last longer.\n\nI've had your products for decades. I use them at work and the connectivity and continuity between them is still one of your greatest advantages.

Aside from your power adapter, USB C is nowhere near wide adoption. By the time they will be, someone will be looking for their next computer.

What's the benefit of the thinnest laptop ever, touting the virtues of portability when EVERY single thing plugged into this will be an adapter?

Seemed unnecessary given that it was replacing the F keys and I preferred the tactile keys for those functions. Why add two button presses where only one existed before? I was then convinced by the idea that the main keys (volume, brightness, etc.) will be on top and can be adjusted with a press/swipe. Ok. I'll buy that.\n\nBut, fuck. You've gone too far on ports, Apple. As I sit here, there are two adapters plugged into my laptop, plus a hard drive, plus an HDMI port used, and I used the SD card slot and the second USB port for adding content from my CF card to the HDD it was also plugged into. Not to mention a keyboard and mouse through Bluetooth. You've dropped this from six ports to four. And one of those four will be charging he laptop. Unless, of course, I get yet another adapter to allow a port to act as both port and charger. This is a pro computer, so you say. As such, this is not enough for the heavy users. We use direct connections. We connect to multiple monitors. We need extra HDD space to access files. Your choices make being effective at a job more difficult.\n\nModularity is fine, when it serves a genuine purpose. Saving 3mm is not one of those purposes. Telling me a laptop is 20% lighter at this point tells me you've got less batteries in there. They're the heaviest part of the computer.

I use them at work and the connectivity and continuity between them is still one of your greatest advantages.

Aside from your power adapter, USB C is nowhere near wide adoption. By the time they will be, someone will be looking for their next computer.

Most were HAM licensed and well enough educated to not be a total stooge. We *had* to be on it. And Once DJI removed the idiot filter, they came out in force and where we were doing great for years before, suddenly our community was under attack by media and PR, and it is because of DJI making super high powered things available RTF to anyone with money (you know the ones, that have more dollars than sense). Also the RTF crowd seems to feel a little extra special and entitled. \"Well I spent so and so $$ on this and it crashed during Return To home!\" Its always someones elses fault, or the machines. User error is rarely even a part of the thought process when almost always, they caused the crash by not flying the thing and relying on GPS to do their job for them. GPS signal drops randomlly at times, you need to be ready to fly hands on at a moments notice, and most have no idea how to take active control in the event of a gps commuication loss.

Something like a Nano QX or maybe a 180QX (both from Blade) these will teach you how to fly, deal with clumsy thumbs, learn orientation and if needed very basic repairs take a few minutes at most. After you have spent some time with it and can send it where you want, how you want, when you want without incident, than you can do the same with a big one, but big ones are dangerous, heavy, and crunch when crashed and gets expensive and time consuming real fast. Little ones bounce and you can fly right after, over and over.  Just learn the basics of flight before adding precious cargo and all these other bells and whistles.

For the company, they could split the same pie among 40 customers or 10.", "id": "d9wtbld"}, {"comment": "I'm not arguing about bandwidth (I actually specifically said I support different prices for speeds). I'm arguing against data caps. \n\nData is the electrons of the signal. The cost an ISP incurs to move one electron (essentially a bit) from a source to a destination is factually, literally, and exactly 0. It does not corrode their lines, it does not fatigue their hardware. It has absolutely zero effect on their system. \n\nNow, how many bits they can move at any given timespan is the bandwidth you were mentioning. And this unit of measurement actually does have limitations and costs associated with increasing the size. Which is why it makes sense to charge people for more or less access to this finite resource. \n\nBut *data* itself is not finite, and it costs nothing  to produce or transmit (once the hardware is in place). \n\nImagine if the current hardware on the Internet suddenly stopped and it was just two computers talking to each other across the country. All the switching hardware and transmission lines are still working at 100%, it's just that every other device has taken a break for some reason. \n\nThe cost to maintain the Internet as a whole *doesn't change*. \n\n99.999% of the traffic went away, and nothing would change in regards to ISP costs. \n\nSo, now let's have everyone get back online and now we all have data caps. Say I hit my data cap early in the cycle and get throttled in speed. But if I live in an area where the network isn't taxed (read: bandwidth is still largely unused) or at a time of day when few people are using the system (like 3am on Christmas), what is the physical, logical reason that I get throttled? A reason besides \"that's what you agreed to\". \n\nThere isn't one. \n\nNow, throttling me more so than others when the network *is* stressed, fine. But since we established that in all other situations (when the network is not stressed), my data traffic isn't costing anyone any money, time, or effort there is no reason to penalize me for data usage. \n\nAt best, data caps are a lazy way to get people to not stress the network infrastructure so that the company doesn't have to upgrade anything. The most likely situation is that data caps are just a cash grab to get free money from customers. The worst case is that it's a way for ISPs to actively hinder competition for services they offer (like Netflix and hulu). \n\n(That last bit is actually what Net Neutrality is all about.) \n\nDoes that make sense? I can come up with slightly different explanations and analogies to help round out the argument if you want, because sadly this is a complex enough topic that a single analogy can sometimes fall short or be confusing (like the traditional \"pipes and tubes\" analogy). \n\nEdit: minor formatting changes.

I was thinking this would be a great opportunity for me as I can use this to replace both my iMac and iPad.

So, it would be a bit of a plus in this regard.

You can still get updates by flashing them yourself, but you may not like doing that. The Pixel also has the best smartphone camera there is right now, and comes in two size options. The only downsides are the design and pricing. The OnePlus 3 (or 3T, now) is also an excellent choice, and IMO the best Android money can buy right now; however, you might find getting service for it more difficult, depending on where you live. It also is more open - you can freely unlock and root with no voiding of warranty, which basically guarantees unofficial software updates for the foreseeable future. That may not be of interest to you right now, but it may well be in a few years.\n\nThe Galaxy S7 is also a good choice: waterproof, looks amazing, great build, excellent camera, wireless charging, and can be found for a good price these days. However, once they decide to drop software support for it, you're screwed - no flashing on a recent Galaxy.\n\nIf you'd like something with less of a learning curve, check out a Huawei or Honor device - the interface is based on (*cough* ripped off from *cough*) iOS, and is quite similar in many regards. It also has far more features than any of the other devices I've mentioned, if that interests you. The Honor 8 is an excellent candidate, and IMO the most gorgeous phone available right now. Great hardware and camera as well, but is unfortunately in the same boat as the S7 when it comes to updates. It's aftermarket development scene *is* slowly picking up, though.\n\nNow, if all of that sounds like more than you really want to think about, and you just want a phone that'll work without you having to worry about its spec sheet, the iPhone 6S might indeed be a better choice. You won't be getting anything new hardware or feature wise, but it'll allow you to do everything you've already been doing just as well, if not better.

No. Most definitely not why I use Android. Hell, it's even a fairly popular opinion that the best platform on which to use Google services is iOS. I use Android because it allows me to treat my phone like the computer it is, and do stuff on it that I would do on my actual computer.

I can still install my apps, I have alternatives to almost every Google service, and battery life gets a bump. Of course, personally, I'm very invested in Google services, so I do need them, but Android is perfectly fine with or without it.

In other words, right now, if you are still considering apple, you're technologically blind.\n\nThat's mostly because Apple isn't really a tech company; they're an image company. So when talking to a tech-blind person who is buying an image, I have found that you have to paint the image as it really is. Really tech-backwards old people, cult-afficionados, and people who don't like having options.

But if you want more, figure that out and say so. \n\nBut even as a man who prides himself on knowing the ins and outs of the tech market there's more bands than ever before, many of the new brands have better phones than the long established brands, sometimes the specs aren't quite what they promise, theres a litany of new features and new perspectives on old features, all the reviewers have different priorities and biases...so well...I am telling you *from experience:* it will get very 'overwhelming' very quickly as you go down the rabbit hole.", "id": "daatbsl"}, {"comment": "When I say I've 'only ever had apple' it's not because I'm an apple fan girl. It's because I have had precisely two smartphones: the iPhone 4 and this 5s. Both were purchased at a time when Apple were still quite dominant and producing decent handsets. The very fact that I'm not leaping to buy an overpriced iPhone 7 should tell you that I'm not wed to Apple. It's also not unreasonable for me to consider the cheaper iPhone 6s in terms of ease of transition - I have plenty of apps I've paid for after all, and would lose those in moving to android. ****\n\nI have read countless reviews of the pixel, the new oneplus 3T and the s7. Perhaps I should have stated that explicitly in my post, apologies that I didn't. Those are the ones I'm weighing up against the 6S. \n\nI'm more than familiar with the galaxy series. For instance, my boyfriend has an S6 which I regularly use myself. I'm not going to get an s5 or 6 though, not when I can afford an S7 or Pixel, which will last much longer before becoming clunky and outdated.

While you're comparing the batteries of these phones, look specifically at talk time vs usage time as you seem to be looking more on the usage side. The Galaxy S7 camera's low light capabilities is amazing IMO. But I don't know what your priorities are, the unlimited photo/video storage on the Pixel is very attractive. I find that the Pixel out performs the GS7 on battery usage, unless I disable data (and use wifi), and then they are very similar. Strangely, I found that in airplane mode (with wifi on), my GS7 actually outlasted the Pixel. While these weren't scientific tests (just random usage), I personally believe, that the GS7 data & cellular connection use more power than the Pixel. And the Pixel wifi uses a tiny bit more power than the GS7. \n\n3T is awesome, but I've only played with one for about an hour. I liked the touch, the speed, etc. From what I've read, it's solid. If it comes down to saving a bit of money, I imagine the price difference is easily worth it. I think it's on par with the others in performance.

Compatibility with other systems gives you flexibility to add other categories of smart products but probably introduces some security issues. A product line with diversity allows you to expand more easily.\n\nTwo issues to think about that probably aren't in most guides are the issues of internet security and whether using particular smart devices will adversely affect you if your internet provider has a low data cap. Many recent news stories have focused on malware that uses \"the internet of things\" such as smart home devices for various internet attacks. Before investing in smart home devices and smart lighting, consider whether your modem, router, and security measures need updating or replacement. Look for devices from companies with a good record of pushing out quick updates. Look at where the devices are made as well.\n\nAs for data caps, you will need to determine if your provider has a cap and if so, what traffic is actually counting toward that cap.

Dan Goodin/YouTube\n\nA researcher has developed a gadget that is capable of hijacking most drones mid-flight \u2014 locking the owner out and giving the attacker complete control over the device.\n\nJonathan Andersson, a manager at Trend Micro's TippingPoint DVLab, showed off his findings at the PacSec Security conference on Wednesday, and talked to Ars Technica and The Register about his work.\n\nAndersson calls his gadget Icarus, and it isn't available to buy \u2014 but it's theoretically replicable by others. It has some pretty obvious benefits to law enforcement, and people trying to protect their property. Pesky drone flying around? Just hijack it and land it safely. But on the flipside, it could also be used for more nefarious purposes.\n\ndrone jansen cat orville\nYou could hijack this drone with Icarus, if you really wanted to. Cris Toala Olivares/Reuters\nThere are already jamming devices out there that block controlling radio signals, rendering a drone useless. But they don't give the attacker control like Icarus does. It works by exploiting DMSx, the radio signal protocol that most remote-controlled consumer drones on the market use \u2014 letting the hijacker take the reins.\n\n\"The shared secret ('secret' used loosely as it is not encrypted) exchanged is easily reconstructed long after the binding process is complete by observing the protocol and using a couple of brute-force techniques,\" Andersson told Ars Technica. \"Further, there is a timing attack vulnerability wherein I synchronize to the target radio's transmissions and transmit a malicious control packet ahead of the target, and the receiver accepts my control information and rejects the targets.\"\n\nConcerningly, it's not clear whether this is an issue that could ever be fixed or patched. \"My guess is that it will not be easy to completely remedy the situation ... The manufacturers and partners in the ecosystem sell standalone radio transmitters, models of all kinds, [and] transmitters that come with models and standalone receivers. Only a certain set of standalone transmitters have a firmware upgrade capability, though the fix is needed on the model/receiver side.\"\n\nAnd DSMx isn't just used in drones \u2014 meaning other radio-controlled products will also be vulnerable. \"It works against all DSMx based radio systems, which would include drones, airplanes, cars, boats, and so on,\" the researcher told The Register.\n"], [21, "Sammy Kamkar made tutorials on how to do this like a year ago.

The entire mfg_id is sent during binding so that the Rx can follow the same frequency sequence, but only the last two bytes of the mfg_id are sent during normal operation to identify the transmitter. So this device analyzes the sequence of frequencies hopped and brute forces the first two bytes until it finds a mfg_id that creates a matching frequency hopping sequence. Then there's a very weak \"encryption\" layer that does some weird bit manipulation stuff and then uses the mfg_id as the key."]], [[{"comment": "So he created a hack for one lightly protected protocol, which isn't really for security, but mostly to allow it to work at RC shows with many other radios around.

Dan Goodin/YouTube\n\nA researcher has developed a gadget that is capable of hijacking most drones mid-flight \u2014 locking the owner out and giving the attacker complete control over the device.\n\nJonathan Andersson, a manager at Trend Micro's TippingPoint DVLab, showed off his findings at the PacSec Security conference on Wednesday, and talked to Ars Technica and The Register about his work.\n\nAndersson calls his gadget Icarus, and it isn't available to buy \u2014 but it's theoretically replicable by others. It has some pretty obvious benefits to law enforcement, and people trying to protect their property. Pesky drone flying around? Just hijack it and land it safely. But on the flipside, it could also be used for more nefarious purposes.\n\ndrone jansen cat orville\nYou could hijack this drone with Icarus, if you really wanted to. Cris Toala Olivares/Reuters\nThere are already jamming devices out there that block controlling radio signals, rendering a drone useless. But they don't give the attacker control like Icarus does. It works by exploiting DMSx, the radio signal protocol that most remote-controlled consumer drones on the market use \u2014 letting the hijacker take the reins.\n\n\"The shared secret ('secret' used loosely as it is not encrypted) exchanged is easily reconstructed long after the binding process is complete by observing the protocol and using a couple of brute-force techniques,\" Andersson told Ars Technica. \"Further, there is a timing attack vulnerability wherein I synchronize to the target radio's transmissions and transmit a malicious control packet ahead of the target, and the receiver accepts my control information and rejects the targets.\"\n\nConcerningly, it's not clear whether this is an issue that could ever be fixed or patched. \"My guess is that it will not be easy to completely remedy the situation ... The manufacturers and partners in the ecosystem sell standalone radio transmitters, models of all kinds, [and] transmitters that come with models and standalone receivers. Only a certain set of standalone transmitters have a firmware upgrade capability, though the fix is needed on the model/receiver side.\"\n\nAnd DSMx isn't just used in drones \u2014 meaning other radio-controlled products will also be vulnerable. \"It works against all DSMx based radio systems, which would include drones, airplanes, cars, boats, and so on,\" the researcher told The Register.\n", "id": "d9cu00c"}, {"comment": "> nearly any drone\n\nNo, nearly any toy quadcopter.

The entire mfg_id is sent during binding so that the Rx can follow the same frequency sequence, but only the last two bytes of the mfg_id are sent during normal operation to identify the transmitter. So this device analyzes the sequence of frequencies hopped and brute forces the first two bytes until it finds a mfg_id that creates a matching frequency hopping sequence.

The answer is that, yes, they (Samsung) can just disconnect your phone from a mobile network. All manufacturers have that ability. However, you are only able to do this by actually modifying the core software of the phone which requires multiple steps so that once it gets to your device, all the proper entities have \"signed\" off of the software package. The device then checks the signatures and can install it. Some updates, like PRL and other basic network connectivity updates, are done automatically, others, like OS updates, have to be authorized by the user.  \n  \nThe update that would remove the functionality of the radios connecting to the network could be done one of two ways. 1) Via a software update to the core OS, which would be pushed out by samsung. They could disable the radios in the device, although this is dangerous considering that it may need to be used for emergency calls. I'm not in the software engineering department, but I'm willing to bet that they have a patch that would allow only emergency functionality via cellular radios (they employ some pretty brilliant people). 2) Via carrier blacklisting. This can be done via the IMEI on GSM standards (HSPA, and LTE networks), or ESN/MEID (CDMA, EVDO, LTE on a CDMA standard network) blacklisting. Whenever a device communicates with a network, it sends that identifying number that allows a carrier to identify and service its devices. If the carrier blacklisted the devices, then they would basically boot them off of the network with nothing more than updating a list on their end.  \n  \nAs for your cybersecurity concerns: for carrier blacklisting, I'm not familiar with security measures put in place on the process, but even then, breaching and implementing a block on a network will only allow you to block devices on that specific network all while subscribers still had access to emergency services. As for software disabling, the process is close to impossible to do and has multiple signatures on any major update to a device. The process is very secure start to end, and almost all major updates dealing with something like the radio chipset simply can't be installed without end user permissions. Is there a chance that someone could maliciously push out an update that targets qualcomm modems? Of course there is a *chance* but hey, you could also win the lottery!", "id": "d9lw48x"}, {"comment": "I guarantee they are using an ESN/IMEI blacklist at the carrier level rather than pushing a software update to nuke the modem firmware. Why?\n\n1. Basebands exist from previous OTAs and one can manually flash a baseband to replace the borked one and restore service.\n\n2. One could easily refuse the OTA.\n\n3. OTAs can't be pushed to users with 3rd party ROMs such as the popular CyanogenMod\n\n4. OTAs won't apply if the recovery partition has been replaced with a custom recovery.\n\n5. OTAs take time to download. Marking the IMEI/ESN as invalid/stolen takes place on the next re-auth.\n\n6. A borked baseband is much riskier. By law in a ton of countries a phone always has to be able to call emergency numbers such as 911, 999, 0118 999 881 99 9119 7253, etc. You'd need to ensure the baseband still allows connecting in these cases and there's a lot of global jurisdictions; it would be easy to mess up one of them.\n\n7.

This isn't an uncommon thing and if they didn't have this, how would the phones work in the first place with the carrier you are paying for service?\n\nEdit: Comma", "id": "d9m6sap"}, {"comment": "> This isn't an uncommon thing and if they didn't have this, how would the phones work in the first place with the carrier you are paying for service?\n\nIn most of the world (basically, not the US), we use SIM cards. Every SIM card contains the account-unique IMSI and also a SIM-unique ICCID.

(Maybe /r/sysadmin/, /r/virtualization/, or /r/programming?)\n\nOnce you have target performance/capabilities in mind, you can start looking for mini PCs with appropriate components or start planning to assemble one yourself. You might try browsing through previous mini PC discussions on /r/buildapc/ and other parts of reddit. If something sounds interesting do some research on the PC or the component (read/watch reviews, compare specs, check prices, etc.).\n\nYou could also try asking for help on /r/buildapc/. If you do make a post there, be sure to read the posting rules/guidelines in their sidebar first and provide details so that people can offer specific help. In any case, you're likely to find more helpful responses over there. \n\nI haven't put together a PC in a long time, which is why I'd suggest considering opinions other than my own. With that said, I have been looking around for a replacement for my computer recently and there are a few mini PCs that came to mind.\n\nHave you considered a [DeskMini 110](http://www.asrock.com/nettop/Intel/Deskmini%20110%20Series/#Specification)? This model (the non-W) has a HDMI port, an ethernet port, it lacks Wifi or BT capabilities (although a module can be installed), and you could use a 4 core, 8 thread 65W [i7-6700](http://ark.intel.com/products/88196/Intel-Core-i7-6700-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_00-GHz) (with compatible CPU cooler heights in the range of a standard box fan). There's also room for a m.2 SSD as well as 2 SSDs or HHDs under the motherboard. However with the DeskMini you're limited to 16 GB of RAM, the integrated graphics present on the CPU (HD 530, if you use the i7-6700), and 4 USB ports (1XC, 2x3.0, 1x2.0). The case also lacks dust filters or room for a case fan, which limits air circulation to the CPU cooler. While the DeskMini 110 fits your non-intrusive requirements (it's also physically quite small), it might be a little underpowered depending on what you have in mind.\n\nIf you'd like more RAM, but you're comfortable with integrated graphics, and you can live with Wifi/BT built in, there are products like the [Cubi 2 Plus](https://us.msi.com/Barebone/Cubi-2-Plus.html#hero-specification), [Cubi 2 vPro](https://us.msi.com/Barebone/Cubi-2-Plus-vPro.html#hero-specification), and comparable products from other manufacturers. However, these Cubi PCs can only use up to 35W processors, such as the [i7-6700T](http://ark.intel.com/products/88200/Intel-Core-i7-6700T-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-3_60-GHz), which has a lower base clock and turbo than what's compatible with a DeskMini 110.\n\nThe [Intel Skull Canyon NUC](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-kit-nuc6i7kyk-features-configurations.html) offers better graphics with CPU performance comparable to the Cubis (it uses the [i7-6770HQ](http://ark.intel.com/products/93341/Intel-Core-i7-6770HQ-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_50-GHz)). However, I've read from users that units can be hit or miss in terms of hardware issues. Some people have experienced major problems and others haven't.\n\nIf you need a more powerful graphics card and don't mind the PC taking up slightly more space, maybe check out some of the offerings from [ZOTAC](https://www.zotac.com/us/product/mini_pcs/zbox-e-series/all) or other manufacturers. I'm not interested in a ton of graphical power, so I haven't explored much of what's available in this category.\n\nIf you'll need things like ECC memory, a CPU with more than 4 cores/8 threads, or other features, you may want to explore workstation PCs (like the one in this article) or build your own computer.\n\nI've just started looking into the possibilities of using a 4 core/8 thread [Xeon E3-1270 v5](http://ark.intel.com/products/88174/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E3-1270-v5-8M-Cache-3_60-GHz) on a C236 Mini-ITX or Micro-ATX board. But so far it's seeming like it might be too restrictive for what I have in mind.\n\nIf you're interested in more cores and threads, you could use a X99 motherboard with a LGA 2011-v3 socket for a 6+ core CPU. There is a [X99 ITX motherboard](http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/X99E-ITXac/) as well as a number of [m-ATX options](http://pcpartpicker.com/products/motherboard/#c=101&f=7). You could potentially assemble a custom PC that fit your needs in a small ITX case, although you couldn't get it as small as the pre-built PCs offered by manufacturers.\n\nThere are probably many options I've forgotten or never heard about, so I'd suggest doing more research after you've determined more precisely what you'll need in a PC. And again, think about hitting up /r/buildapc/ and relevant subreddits for information and advice. Good luck.", "id": "da6u9or"}, {"comment": "THANK YOU!!!\n\nThis was quite informative. I have been looking for some time and recognize a few things you mentioned (NUC having varying degrees a quality, etc). I want to go fown the buildapc route so this is a good primer for me.\n", "id": "da75gaa"}, {"comment": "Aside from the partially pre-made options from manufacturers (where you add select components like RAM, storage, etc.), if you're planning on building your own you might want to check out the small cases that are available. When you have a case in mind you can start ruling out components based on their compatibility (or you can eliminate cases based on their restrictions and deficits).\n\nHere are a couple run downs from about 3 years ago: [a list on reddit of m-ITX and m-ATX cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1tvwqb/choosing_a_case_pt_4_small_form_factor_mitx_and/) and [a video comparing m-ITX cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4zBocfSH3g). However, a number of new products have come out since then.\n\nFor instance, If you want something very compact, there is the [NCASE M1](https://www.ncases.com), [Cougar QBX](http://cougargaming.com/products/cases/qbx/), or the [DAN Cases A4-SFX](https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php) (although this case is out of stock at the moment).\n\nIf you're looking for a slim case similar to a gaming console, there is the [Node 202](http://www.fractal-design.com/home/product/cases/node-series/node-202), the smallest [Raven cases](http://www.silverstonetek.com/raven/products/index.php?model=RVZ01&area=en), and others.\n\nIf you'd like more airflow and room for a larger CPU cooler, you might check out the toaster oven shaped cases such as the [Core 500](http://www.fractal-design.com/home/product/cases/core-series/core-500), [PC-Q10](http://www.lian-li.com/en/dt_portfolio/pc-q10/), [SG13](http://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=536&area=en), and others. These cases may be bigger than what you have in mind though; they're certainly bigger than the mini PCs I listed. Here are a couple video to give you an idea of how large the Core 500 is: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9B0TJJBJ2s) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QM1iKP8T7c).\n\nVCR-like cases: [GD09](http://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=488&area=en), [Node 605](http://www.fractal-design.com/home/product/cases/node-series/node-605), etc. At this point the PC is getting larger, but you'd be able to use a standard ATX motherboard (although with a CPU cooling height restriction).\n\nFor small cases in general, you may want to check out /r/sffpc/ and possibly /r/htpc/. But /r/buildapc will still probably have the most discussions on these topics.\n\nAnd if you're interested in something similar to a DeskMini 100, you could build your own equivalent with a Mini-STX motherboard and a case like the [VT01](http://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=708), although the CPU cooler height is very restrictive on this case. It may be worth waiting for other Mini-STX cases to come onto the market, especially since some of these motherboards have case fan headers ([an example](https://www.asus.com/Motherboards/H110S1/)).\n\nEDIT: In addition, here are a few small m-ATX cases: the [Raijintek Styx](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA66Z38G5981), the Thermaltake Urban [S1](http://www.thermaltake.com/Chassis/Micro_Case_/Urban/C_00002290/Urban_S1/Design.htm) (and [SD1](http://www.thermaltake.com/Chassis/Micro_Case_/Urban/C_00002291/Urban_SD1/Design.htm)), and the [Cooler Master N200](http://www.coolermaster.com/case/mini-tower/n200/). I looked around a bit before, but didn't really find an exceptional m-ATX case that was on the smaller side. With that said, there might be cases out there I don't know about.", "id": "da7i121"}], [{"comment": "Anyone who thinks that this can replace a Mac Mini, doe not understand why people buy the Mac Mini.

You'd also have to bring someone on premises for maintenance or repair, or else you'd want *even more* drones so that you could have some out of rotation for several days or weeks, being shipped back to a maintenance/repair facility.\n\nNow, what would be amazingly cool is if you could coordinate all of that automatically.  You could use some basic AI to coordinate a rotation and have the drones land on a charger when theyre out of power, and fly themselves to a repair facility as needed.  Then you'd only need to send someone on premises or arrange shipping in cases where the drone is so damaged that it can't make it to the repair facility.\n\nCreating an AI for that purpose may seem like overkill, but it's essentially the same thing Uber is going to want to do in a few years when they have a fleet of self-driving electric cars.  I'm sure they'll want to develop a system that can coordinate thousands of self-driving cars to maintain adequate coverage 24/7, while scheduling some to return so some kind of facility for recharge, maintenance, and repairs.  Plus, the government will be doing this with drones if they aren't already.  If someone develops an AI that coordinate this sort of thing effectively, then there will be many uses for it over the coming years.\n\nThere are also other issues like weather, but I can imagine how that would be handled.

I think I would rather have a MacBook Pro. The tablet is nice for taking notes, but way to large and awkward to use for watching video or browsing the web.

My Surface Pen has stopped working entirely, and I'm waiting for the Microsoft Store to open here in Nashville so I can get it repaired. My screen has a ton of dead pixels in the bottom left corner of the display. It doesn't come back to life sometimes because it tries to update itself when the lid is closed and fails, forcing you to power off the thing manually. The trackpad sucks, although the keyboard feels great. Finally, Windows doesn't do a good enough job at scaling applications to the high resolution display (if you have a 4k monitor on your PC, you know what I'm talking about) so everything is super tiny in apps like TeamSpeak3, GIMP, and and Calibre.

They're also simply testing the waters and seeing what works and what doesn't. It's a good marketing strategy and also a good way to not be forced to put together a large hardware supply chain without being sure what they and consumers really want out wearable cameras.

It's similar to what happened to the Wii \u2014 Nintendo's supply chain simply can't spin up fast enough when they need it to. There's is *very* little for Nintendo to gain from artificially restricting supply; they would love to take people's money as much as possible (and will likely lose some of that revenue because of delays getting new units to market). Nintendo is a black box when it comes to how exactly their supply chain works, but everything seems to point towards some sort failure to keep up with industry standards like just-in-time manufacturing and using smart analytics to predict and adjust to demand. My sense from people within Nintendo (on the U.S. side) is that they were simply caught wrongfooted, once again. \n\nSo Spectacles is absolutely a marketing gimmick, and Snap likely doesn't care that the aftermarket scalping of their product is booming \u2014 it's probably quite happy about it.

It's a good marketing strategy and also a good way to not be forced to put together a large hardware supply chain without being sure what they and consumers really want out wearable cameras. (FWIW, they're very neat and potentially revolutionary, but have some real issues with battery life and video management.)\n\n2. Nintendo, I think, simply has very real supply chain issues. It's similar to what happened to the Wii \u2014 Nintendo's supply chain simply can't spin up fast enough when they need it to. There's is *very* little for Nintendo to gain from artificially restricting supply; they would love to take people's money as much as possible (and will likely lose some of that revenue because of delays getting new units to market). Nintendo is a black box when it comes to how exactly their supply chain works, but everything seems to point towards some sort failure to keep up with industry standards like just-in-time manufacturing and using smart analytics to predict and adjust to demand. My sense from people within Nintendo (on the U.S. side) is that they were simply caught wrongfooted, once again. \n\nSo Spectacles is absolutely a marketing gimmick, and Snap likely doesn't care that the aftermarket scalping of their product is booming \u2014 it's probably quite happy about it.

The first way is to have machines with bespoke molds, and set the factory up so that the machines feed directly into each other, and the machines can make the parts with a minimum of human involvement (if any at all). The second way is to have machines with specialized surfaces that the operator can use to manipulate the metal - bend it, fold it, extrude it, grind it, buff it, whatever. He may have forms that he uses to check the piece, but ultimately it's his hands and mind that control the output.  The third way is to have a guy with an anvil and hammer standing next to a fire and banging away at the metal piece. \n\nThe third option is obviously not the case here. Pagani and Konigsegg can use the second option, as they make tens of cars per year. They don't need a production line; the car can sit in the same spot on the factory floor, and everyone moves around it.\n\nIf you produce a few hundred per year - which means at least one per work day - then you have some sort of assembly line process. The space needed for the small-scale ad-hoc building process is immense, as each car waits until pieces are ready for it; that could be an entire year's worth of cars all waiting on the factory floor while someone makes some component that they all need. I'm pretty sure that even McLaren doesn't do this for their higher-production road cars, though they may do it for a model that they sell maybe a few dozen of per year.\n\nThey may have an assembly line that depends more on human labor than machine labor, but I'm pretty sure it's still an assembly line process - it just uses human arms instead of robot arms. That's probably cheaper than the cost to setup robots for every step of production (it takes a LOT of robots).\n\nBut, the components are almost certainly made from molds, and the machines that make the components follow pre-set patterns. There's a big difference between having a machine laser-cut 100 pieces of steel in the same pattern versus having a human do it. And in almost all cases, you prefer to have the machine do it. The only reason to use human labor is if it's too expensive to set the machines up to do the task. And good machines can usually do it better than a good human.\n\n\"Hand made\" doesn't mean quality; it means that human arms were cheaper than robot arms. You can get a knockoff watch from China that was hand made - probably far more hand-made than the real watch which costs thousands of dollars - but the quality will be poor. For all the precise bits, you need a machine to do the work. And once you have that machine, further work is a lot cheaper. ", "id": "dad378p"}, {"comment": "This could be it.

I haven't used other attempts at this such as cyngwin, etc so I'm not sure on the quality of it compared to other terminal emulators.", "id": "d9j24k6"}, {"comment": "> Windows bash won't ever support anything outside of the CLI for some obvious reasons\n\nNot sure if you mean that in the sense that you haven't seen an explanation of why it is limited to the CLI or not.\n\nBash on Windows isn't just bash ported to Windows. It is the Ubuntu Linux bash binary running in a Linux ABI-compatible [subsystem](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Windows_2000_architecture.svg) that runs along-side the Win32 subsystem and on top of the NT kernel. It is turning into the new version of the POSIX subsystem that Services for Unix used to provide.\n\nMicrosoft does have some protections put into place that prevents cross-talk between subsystems. This is why the \"open .\" equivalent doesn't currently and may never work. It would require a Linux application to know that it is running in a Windows subsystem, break free of it, and talk to an application running in another subsystem. A close Linux equivalent would be an application running in a chroot or container talking to an application in another.\n\nFrom the point of view of an application running in the Linux subsystem, it is just running on the Linux kernel. There will be a lot of portions of the ABI it is missing or parts that behave in a way that is different than what is documented. Microsoft will eventually fix most of the bugs and it will get more reliable.\n\nMy initial thought about them creating the Linux subsystem was going to be for providing native support in Windows Server for Docker images. The current way that Docker images run on Windows is through the help of a Linux VM running in Hyper-V. Microsoft has been very pro-container lately and has put a lot of money into (and tried to buy) Docker.", "id": "d9j5djd"}, {"comment": "Works great as far as I can tell.

I've heard thirdhand that \nexisting drones already do this - you select a target and the drone\nwill track the blob of pixels using some form of machine vision.  So the drone both leads the target with the laser designator for the hellfire missile or bomb and continues to track as the target moves.\n\nSo if you pull the trigger and there's a half second of lag (what I have read is pretty common because satellite links are inherently laggy due to the speed of light to geosync), it's ok.  The drone will continue to track where the target moved over half a second and so the firing command will still engage the same target.  Unless it glitches out and the reticle jumps to something close by that looks very similar, but you can't drop a 250 lb bomb or a missile on someone without occasionally breaking a few eggs...\n\nThat's how infantry killbots would work as well.  They'd be semi-autonomous - probably able to open doors and walk up stairs and past obstacles using onboard intelligence.  The operator would probably control them by moving around a little \"pip\" representing the intended destination.  Then, when you choose to shoot someone, it's just a lock on aimbot.  A rectangle around each possible target, the operator chooses the rectangle using a select button, it changes from green to red (or some other color change), then the operator pulls the trigger.  \n\nThe robot would automatically choose center mass as the aimpoint, solve any ballistic corrections, move the servos on the mount the gun is on to aim at the right angle, and then fire at where the target has moved to.  Probably easier to kill someone remotely using a killbot than it would be to kill someone in an FPS game.\n\nOn the bright side, it would be entirely practical to take someone alive.  After all, if the robot is shot you can fix it, and it's probably armored.  So you could safely use less lethal ammo, since if the less lethal ammo fails to disable the target, no one on the friendly side loses their life.  Taser rounds, beanbags, CS spray, that sort of thing.\n\nAlso possible to shoot the gun out of someone's hand.  Again, the reason human military/police/SWAT don't try for this shot is they have a low probability of a hit, and if they miss and get shot by the bad guy, they might die.

However, the limiting factor in your system is almost certainly the GPU. Your CPU while several years old now probably isn't the bottleneck in your system, and while I would consider 8gb of ram a minimum these days, it certainly isn't too little and won't be a bottleneck for gaming. Most games barely use 2gb.\n\nYou're probably best off looking at pre-owned parts, probably 1-2 generations old. Try looking for components such as the GTX 770, GTX 780 or GTX 960 from Nvidia, or if you want something newer then look at the GTX 1050, GTX 1050Ti or GTX 1060. From AMD, the RX 460 would be a safe option as well. All of these cards are capable of playing even the latest titles at high settings, often above 60FPS. However, I advise you to do your own research and make a decision for yourself.\n\nAs far as a power supply goes, I wouldn't be able to say unless you knew the capacity of your current psu, and you knew what GPU you want to put in your system.\n\nAnother way to try and improve the performance of your machine would be to reformat your hard drive and reinstall windows, you likely received a 'restore disk' in the box you bought your computer in. Of course, ensure that you have backed up anything you want to keep before doing this, such as documents, photos etc, but once complete your machine will probably run smoother as any background junk/malware/viruses will have been removed. If you don't want to do this, at least go into your control panel and defragment your hard drive.

The fact that you're getting lots of lag with only 2gb of ram being used suggests that there's something running in the background that you're unaware of.\n\nOlder cards as I said above you're probably looking at a GTX 770/780/960.

If I had any knowledge on gadgets I'd help answer a few of these other questions, sorry!", "id": "d9q3z5b"}, {"comment": "First you need to decide on a few factors you might not have considered.\n\nDo you want a touch screen? Makes taking notes in lectures easier\n\nIf so, do you want a detachable/very flexible screen? makes using the touch screen much nicer.\n\nIf the answer to both of these is yes, then you'll be very limited performance wise. Probably at most to a Pentium system with 4-8gb of ram. It probably won't have a full HD screen either. \n\nIf the answer is no, then you have much more flexibility in choosing the specs of your system. \n\nProcessor wise, its very unlikely that you'll need anything more than an i3 or an i5. i7s are overkill for word processing and uni work, and any games you're playing will be gpu bound anyway.\n\nIts very unlikely that you'll find a laptop with a dedicated gpu at this budget, and if you do then make sure to google it and compare its performance to that of the internal gpus in other systems. You might find the performance difference is fairly negligible.\n\nRam - I personally have 8gb in my laptop that I use for my uni work. Ideally i'd like 16, but I often end up with dozens of chrome tabs open at once. So its up to you. If in doubt, 8gb will probably be fine. \n\nYou'll have to go out of your way to find full HD screens in this bracket, but they do exist. \n\nYou'll also want to seriously consider storage space in both options. Yes you may have found an amazing laptop with a detachable screen and good specs, but if it only has a 32gb hard drive, you're going to run out of space rather quickly, especially if you have a large music library. My laptop has a 1TB (1000GB) drive which is probably fine for most people. If you're like me and need more, you can always replace the drive yourself or buy an external drive.\n\nAs far as manufacturers go, both ASUS and Lenovo are fairly reputable manufacturers. However be aware that both of them fill their systems with bloatware, so if you went with them I would recommend spending a while when you first get it to remove such programs. My current laptop is a lenovo and I've had no real problems with it other than this. \n\nDell is a manufacturer that gets a lot of flak in my opinion. If you do your research and have realistic expectations of the performance of a machine, then Dells take a lot to beat. They also have a student discount scheme run through Unidays, extending your budget a little more, and as far as i'm aware bloatware is minimal on their systems.\n\nHP is also a pretty good manufacturer, although lots of their systems are lower end performance wise. They also sell lots of chromebooks so be careful that you choose one with the right operating system (probably windows 10). They also have a student discount scheme run through Unidays.\n\nTL;DR: Make sure you know what you want in your laptop, then go looking based on those decisions. ASUS and Lenovo are fairly good, check out Dell and HP especially with the student discount. \n\nEdit: a note on screen size. My laptop is a 15 inch model, complete with number pad. You'll be lucky to find a number pad on a smaller model. However, smaller screens make for lighter, more portable systems. Generally smaller laptops are also less powerful, but there are many exceptions to that rule including the Surface and Xps lineups. Its really up to you. If you feel portability is more important; go 13 inch.

", "id": "d9g45fq"}, {"comment": "Sorry but having worked for many big companies, banks and educational firms Macs make no sense financially, force steeper relearning curves for staffs because Apple keep changing their design and software philosophies all the time and has poor resale values.  In fact, if one did the calculation on upgrades over 10 years, they would have realised how incredibly expensive it would have been to upgrade Macs every year.  \n\nIt's why companies and businesses have universally opt for PCs/Windows due to better management of maintenance and upgrading costs.  So much easier and cost effective to upgrade processors and storage separately then upgrade complete systems.  That's how I help save numerous companies hundreds and thousands of dollars.\n\nHere's my analogy. Let's say with a budget of $20,000 you chose between 2 cars:\n\n* Car-A cost $17,990.  It is a popular brand, doesn't spend a lot on trying to look luxurious like Car-B but spends wisely on additional features like usb connectivity, better interior storage and unlimited mileage warranty.  The car is lighter and more economical and because it's so popular the brand has built its reputation over the years with proven reliability.  Aftermarket enhancement and performance puts this car to 500hp-800hp range, making many owners very happy in the long run and resale value has been good.\n\n* Car-B cost $19,900.  It is an expensive brand but has less features than Car-A.  It has a nice interior but parts are expensive, the car is heavy and less economical.  Engine has power but is completely maxed out on power with little room for modifications.  Resale value tends to drop like a rock after a year or two because the brand keeps replacing it every year. Recently, the reliability hasn't been too good either.\n\nFinally, both cars need to make a 1000km trip to the other side of the country.  Fortunately for Car-A with $2010 in change, it has no problems with funding for the trip and then some for roof racks, snow tires etc.\nUnfortunately for Car-B with just $100 in change, you have to take more out of your own pockets to fund the trip and if something goes wrong then you are fucked.\n\nCrystal clear for you?", "id": "d9gkblk"}, {"comment": "> \" In fact, if one did the calculation on upgrades over 10 years, they would have realised how incredibly expensive it would have been to upgrade Macs every year.\"\n\nThis is just flat out false. Theres no reason you have to \"upgrade Macs every year\". In the environment I work in, we have Macs that are pushing 10years old and still work perfectly fine.

Theres no reason you have to \"upgrade Macs every year\".\n\nLet's talk about my needs shall we?\n\nBack in 2002 I wanted a laptop with great battery life, good graphics, DVD writer, usb ports, SD card reader and wider screen. Macbook Pro at the time couldn't write to dual layer DVDs and the screen was a pathetic 1440x900.  I got an Epson with a 1680\u00d71050 screen, MobilityRadeon 9700, and 5 hours of battery life.  I could even swap out the DVD drive for another battery pack and extend the battery life to 9 hours.  This was 2002. The laptop lasted me for 5-6 years.  During that period Apple released nothing that I wanted that could replace it, absolutely nothing.\n\nThe next laptop was a Dell XPS with a WUXGA (1920x1200) screen and gaming.  Again Apple had nothing equivalent to it.  The Dell was also one of the highest rated laptop on http://www.notebookcheck.net/, personally it was my least favorite because my other laptops lasted longer, but the ability to play some of the best 3D games at the time on a laptop was unmatched by anything Apple could do.  \n\nTouchscreen laptops came out and naturally I wanted it too.  I bought an Acer back in 2010 and had never looked back.  I recently upgrade to a HP Spectre x360 and it is by far the best laptop I've ever owned.  Super bright 1080p LED touchscreen, plenty of power and an amazing all-day battery life.  It's also a foldable tablet (again technology that Apple has never heard of).\n\nPrior to 2010, Apple couldn't even build a laptop with a built-in SD card reader.\n\nPrior to 2013 Apple had yet to release anything close to a 1080p screen let alone WSXGA+ (1650x1050) or WUXGA (1920x1200).\n\nBy the time their ridiculous \"retina\" series came out in 2013 we were all already using touchscreen laptops and moving on.\n\nIt's 2016 and Apple still has not made a touchscreen laptop let alone a hybrid one like mine.\n\nThere had been 5 iterations of 15.4\" macbooks released between early 2008 to 2013, each costing anywhere from $2300 to $3000.  \n\n**That's $12500 to 15000** in total costs of upgrading to every macbook during that period and they still didn't have the features I needed. Since 2002 I only spent $2800 in total on laptops and got everything I wanted.  I'm a smart buyer, I can make my dollar buy more and last longer than whatever you spend on a Mac.

I explained how expensive Macs are for buying, maintaining and upgrading.  I also explained how my experience and IT expertise help save companies thousands of dollars every year because like I said, many many people want to see their dollar go further in products with technologies that can last longer.  This makes the macbook a bad option for many of them, which is...a lot of people out there.  Face it mate, Apple has been struggling with their PC and laptop lines for a long long time now, which is why they've been concentrating all their efforts on the iPhone to save them and even they are struggling there.  Recognise a common theme in both situation?\n\n> I've only spent around $1,500 on a 2007 Macbook Pro... which is still working to this very day.. and does everything I need. (and I'm not some pansy who does nothing with his computers. I've worked 20+ years in IT and I push my machines pretty hard.\n\nUnfortunately attention to detail may not be one of your best asset.  If you noticed, I bought different laptops for the different technologies that they offered.  If I didn't need touchscreen, gaming or a hybrid style laptop then I would still be using the same laptop from 2002.  Over the years I upgraded my requirements and so did my expectations.  Apple still fails to meet my expectations even today.\n\n> Then you need to realize that your experience is incredibly small/narrow. \n\nI guess you probably want to say that my experiences are \"narrow\", and that is your opinion.  I live in Asia, maybe Apple is not a big thing here but computing definitely is.\n\n> There are plenty of scientists, engineers, programmers and other STEM workers who swear by Macs and use them every day for significantly important things.\n\nI'm sure there are \"some\" people who use Macs and that's fine, but they're the exception not the norm.  I guess the best way to describe why people go for PC than Mac is because of the \"cost per performance\" ratio.  This performance ratio for PCs is so much more attractive than Macs, which makes PC so popular across multiple industries like graphics/3D (I use Unreal Engine and PC/Windows destroys the Mac), engineering and Cad/Cam, schooling, games design, simulations and so on.  \n\nAnd now that touchscreen has become a more acceptable interface on desktop/laptop computers, productivity and creativity can only get better.  Take a look at Microsoft Surface and the Pro.  If that is the sign of things to come then I'm excited because that's exactly the kind of impact I would expect technology to have on society by evolving and improving our lives.

Anything that is an open wound, or blister appearance. \n\n(TL:DR at end)\n\nLong story: the disease process can slowly cut off blood supply to your extremities through a couple of different mechanisms. Once this happens the nerves die, so you loose sensation. This happens in a \"sock and glove\" pattern. \n\nSo without nerves you can't feel your feet/hands. And you don't have blood supply, so any simple cuts or a stubbed toe, and your body can't heal it. \n\nThe loss of nerve supply also changes the structure of the foot, because the passive tension of the muscles is lost. So now the foot has a different shape, so instead of just the heel and toes taking the pressure, other structures are. But you can't feel this! \n\nAll of this leads to pressure sores. So something like a pebble in your shoe, or even just wearing shoes that don't fit result in a wound that is very hard to heal. If it gets infected, it will often lead to amputation. \n\nIt's  very important for diabetic patients with neuropathy to check their feet. We tell them to use a selfie stick  to take pics of the bottom of their feet to look for red spots or cuts. For those that don't have access to a selfie stick, we have them attach a mirror on the end of something like a broom or yard stick, or whatever they have so they check feet daily. \n\nTL:DR Diabetes restricts blood supply, which will damage nerves. Some people loose all sensation in their hands and feet. When they get a minor cut, they can't feel it and their body can't heal it.

That's what causes kidney failure, blindness, neuropathy, etc. We check these things for yearly but it's more to get a sense of how the disease is progressing. By the time you are getting ulcers, the damage is pretty far along and isn't reversible. The ulcers don't get infect because of neuropathy they get infected because the person doesn't have a good blood supply anymore to bring in white blood cells to fight. High blood sugars have also been shown to impair the function of white blood cells. \n\nWhat I was also saying in the original post is that the type of patient that needs amputations is pretty far along in the disease process and already isn't taking care of their disease. An expensive pair of socks which detects for heat changes isn't going to replace basic foot care. Especially when inflammation is a sign of a functioning immune system, which isn't true in someone nearing amputation stage of diabetes. These socks help catch ulcers early, but so do a cheap pair of brand new white socks. \n\nEdit: I'll also add that I treat all new devices with pessimism until they have data to back them up.

For example, consider Waze compared to a standalone GPS unit without data. Waze has always-up-to-date road data, and pretty good crowdsourced traffic/hazard information. It's able to change your route mid-trip if it finds a major traffic problem along the way. Traditional GPS units struggle with this, particularly \"up-to-date\" map data.

Or Audible, for e-books. And if you've got kids in the back seat there's Netflix, Hulu, etc. for video entertainment.

The family without a data connection's going to have to take each exit and hope.

For example:\n\n > OLED display\n\nThere's a surprising number of phones that still have standard LED displays which I don't like, and yet the ones that do have OLED have a bunch of other things that I don't care for.\n\n > Big battery\n\nI want a big battery (think Droid Turbo) which not a lot of phones nowadays even supply, good luck replacing them as well because a lot of them can't be removed without taking the whole phone apart.\n\n > Decent processor\n\nI'm perfectly content with the CPU in my galaxy s4, I don't really have a use for anything more powerful so money spent on the SoC would be sort of wasted on me and I'd prefer to use that money elsewhere.\n\n > Memory\n\nKind of the same point as the processor tbh, I don't need loads of RAM because I rarely multitask much, I think the most I've had open on my phone at one time is Reddit, a chrome tab, fb messenger, and gmail. Why get a phone with loads of memory when I could spent that elsewhere?\n\n > Radios\n\nI'm not sure exactly what radios you mean, things like GSM radio or whatever I don't care about because I don't listen to the radio. Phone antennae are necessary but I don't need extremely sensitive or powerful ones because I have decent signal where I live. Wifi is important but I don't need much passed wireless N because my home network doesn't support higher than that and I don't really need the extra speed.\n\n > Good camera\n\nI wouldn't say good camera, I want a capable rear camera. Nothing with a quadrillion pixels or optical zoom. Just flash and the ability to take a picture that is clear enough to see what's in it.\n\n > amp and high quality speakers\n\nThis is where I'd spend a lot of the money saved on the other components. As I said, I don't care about processing power or RAM, I will likely need a camera but anything more than a capable one is unnecessary.\n\n > Memory\n\nI don't really see the benefit of having a lot of memory built into the device, having an expandable storage slot means I can get lots of cheap storage for music. This is sorely lacking on a lot of phones nowadays which is a huge shame.\n\n > $2 front-facing camera\n\nI really don't think that's what it would be worth. For the sake of argument let's say it's $5 for the actual camera, there's going to be a mark-up from the manufacturer and R&D costs so it's unlikely to retail for that but the cost is irrelevant. I don't need one and I could put something that is more suitable for me in it's place, but I don't get that option with pre-built phones.\n\n > Bulky\n\nAs long as it's light enough for me to keep in my pocket and isn't larger than my pocket I don't really care. I'd trade slimness for a bigger battery any day.\n\n > Brittle\n\nThis point doesn't really make much sense, I'm normally very careful with my stuff so I don't really drop things much if at all. If I did drop it however, you said yourself that everything is enclosed in it's own casing so surely that would make for a less fragile phone? Granted a module might fall off if I dropped it but it wouldn't shatter into a million pieces and would more than likely still work afterwards. The screen might break but I could replace it with essentially no effort.\n\nMy point is that the modularity would let me make a phone that suits me perfectly rather than taking a compromise and going for the closest fit, at which point I would be spending money on (mostly) a more powerful SoC which I don't need, a rear camera that is far better than I will need, a front camera that I don't need at all, and other hardware that I don't really care about.

Just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that it's not any good.\n\nBut just because you put out so much misinformation, allow me to dispel it for everyone else.\n\nLinux actually has more hardware support than any other operating system. Period. In between the legacy devices that aren't even supported by their manufacturers anymore and all the non-Intel platforms that are currently made, the list is huge. Poor hardware support in Linux hasn't been the case in literally decades.\n\nI don't know what to tell you about power management. It does it just as well as any other commercially-supported operating system does. The fact that it is the cornerstone of the world's most prominent smartphone operating system should be a pretty big hint at how good it works. Once again, this seems to come from a decades-old complaint, when the developers were having difficulty working with Intel's ACPI. For reference, ACPI was released all the way back in 1996, and the era when Linux was having difficulty was also the era when the hardware manufacturers themselves had buggy ACPI implementations.\n\nI'll ignore the fact that you've got application support completely backwards (you don't build an OS to support an application, you build an application on top of an OS) for now. Mainstream applications now mean web apps; they are things like Facebook or Gmail, and they will work with every standards-compliant browser. The number one browser, with roughly 50% of web traffic, is Chrome, and that also works on Linux. Number two is Safari, which is built on a fork of KHTML, a rendering engine originally designed specifically to work on top of Linux.\n\nBeyond web apps, there is a huge trove of software that natively runs on Linux. Applications like Transmission and Sublime Text. Linux is where all the hot development is happening right now, to the point that Microsoft is actually supporting a Linux subsystem in Windows and has also ported a number of their enterprise software to run natively in Linux. Even long-running software that doesn't offer native support like Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office works in Linux thanks to Wine.\n\nIf you don't like the interface Linux offers, the good thing is that you have an absurd amount of choice. I mentioned Elementary OS earlier; they run a version of Gnome customized to work like MacOS. If you can't find something you like, then you've probably got a personal problem.

Living with Linux is hard work, takes commitment and perseverance. For the common mortal, who doesn't take anything from fiddling around with that many options, it looks like a mess. As nice and neatly wrapped friendly distros are, they feel crippled and unpolished. One of the examples I like to refer to are Windows assistants. People crap all over them but they get stuff sorted out *or* leads you to a dead end. Linux will lead you into thousands and thousands of forum threads on how to fix it a million ways, and it will at some point involve a command line. Another: you download an app on Windows or OS X and you get a file, EXE or APP/DMG, on Linux you have a bunch of package managers, each with a different file format, but people just want a file on which they click and it install the app, they don't want to have to choose or know which is the right one. Yes, the app stores, or whatever they're called, are a step in the right direction, but a lot of software, hell, most of the software is not in them, you will, at some point, have to deal with repositories and, even worse, dependencies. This is all pretty easy to grasp to someone interested, but to someone who just wants to write an essay or make a spreadsheet, it's too much work. Linux is all over the place while with Windows or OS X you have one place to turn to when you have a problem, not thousands. \n\nMost people hit a wall with Linux because you spend as much time working on it has you spend using it. And yes, Ubuntu, Elementary OS, Mint and the sort have been making *amazing* work to change that, Linux is not nearly as hard as when I ventured into it, but it still is.

Most people don't know shit about how laptops are actually made and engineered, or even the basic differences between mobile i7 chips.\n\n1. CPU: The Macbook Pro 15\" base model comes with an i7-6700HQ, which is a 4 core, 8 thread CPU. The Asus K501UW packs an i7-6500U, which is a 2 core, 4 thread CPU. Not only is there a 2 physical core, 4 virtual thread difference, the 6700HQ turbos up to 3.5GHz while the 6500U only turbos up to 3.1GHz. We can get even deeper and talk about cache sizes and shit but basically, these CPUs are not even in the same class. The HQ is a high end laptop CPU class and the U is the low power CPU class. The decked out Macbook Pro 15\" comes with an i7-6920HQ, which is the best laptop class CPU with a turbo up to 3.8GHz. The only laptops with a better CPU are the ones that come with a desktop CPU, and those will suck your battery faster than a thai hooker on coke, basically only usable when plugged into the power outlet. \n\n2. Touch pad: The Macbooks all have the best touchpads in the laptop market, hands down. There is no competition. Most low end laptops use plastic touchpads with 3rd party drivers, but even Windows laptops with glass trackpads and native Windows drivers don't compare. \n\n3. Battery life: Macbooks have some of the highest battery life in each of their respective classes, and for good reason. Not only does Apple spend A LOT of time carefully selecting each component to balance power and battery life, but they also optimize their software to take full advantage of their hardware. \n\n4. OS: OSX is easier to use, and visually attractive compared to Windows. There is seamless integration within the ecosystem, iPhone, Macbook, Apple Watch, iPad. Messages are synced between devices, you can copy and paste between devices, etc. \n\n5. Build Quality: You can't compare the build quality of a Macbook with ANY Windows laptop period. The machining is so incredibly precise and each product's chassis is almost entirely made out of high grade aluminum. Aluminum is not easy to work with, and it's not a cheap material either. The Razer Blade is probably the closest in terms of overall build quality, but even that doesn't hold a candle to the macbook chassis. I've owned several all aluminum chassis laptops from Razer and Asus (both of which are known for machining aluminum for their laptop chassis) and they're not as high quality as Macbooks. The way the Macbook lid and body perfectly line up, the perfect amount of tension in the Macbook hinge, it's unmatched. Plus, the Macbook holds up steadier in the test of time. \n\n6. Display: The display on the MBP 15\" is basically QHD, with best in class color accuracy and anti-glare coating. The K501UW has a matte FHD display. Matte screens are the cheap way to apply anti-glare properties to a display, it's much much harder to apply anti-glare properties to gloss displays. However, gloss displays have sharper and clearer quality and are easier to clean. \n\n7. Acoustics: The Macbooks all have best in class acoustics. This means that in respects to equivalent hardware and chassis size, the Macbooks will have the quietest operation. A Windows laptop with an i7-6700HQ, mid tier discrete graphics, and as thin as a MBP 15\" will be louder than a MBP. \n\n8. Trinkets: The MBP has an OLED touchbar, a best in class fingerprint reader, a better webcam, a force touch trackpad, and low profile butterfly keyboard. \n\nThe K501UW has a better GPU (better than the base MBP 15\" and equivalent to the top config MBP), but the MBP isn't designed for gaming. It's true that Macbooks are overpriced, even subtracting the R&D that goes into developing OSX and the laptop itself, but most people circlejerk and exaggerate just how overpriced it really is.

But does it have 3 times less cores? No. Also with the way people use their Macbook at this price range, those extra cores doesnt mean anything does it? What for, opening extra 100 tabs browser? Also the GPU in the Asus will surely help a lot more then those extra cores in multiple heavier applications except few apps. If you go to CPU Boss, the difference in multi cores performance is just 5.6 vs 5.3, and single core is just 7.1 vs 7.2.\n&nbsp;\n\n2. Complains about touch pad is so yesterday when the screen itself now is touch enabled. Also the day of cheap=shit has long gone. Some cheap touchpad also work pretty well. Maybe not as well, but not 3 times less well. The way Apple produced their laptop range all using the same components for years might even mean Apple's touchpad is actually cheaper to produce.\n&nbsp;\n\n3. Battery Life is subjective. Apple did it well for sure, but so does many other makers. The difference is other makers have it in all different range while Apple really commit to have all their laptops have good range, I give them that. But yeah, its up to you to research about the battery life first before making purchase.\n&nbsp;\n\n4. No point to argue about the OS. its already 2016. Nobody cares about OS. What you use inside it is what important. 'Seamless integration' can only be taken account when you use ALL their product. I bet if you buy everything ASUS made, you will have seamless integration too.\n&nbsp;\n5. Quality is also subjectives. There is no 'period'. Every people have different qualities their consider. Also saying no other windows laptop have greater quality is just plain ignorant.\n&nbsp;\n\n6. Display is also subjective. Many laptops have better display. Up for you to choose.\n&nbsp;\n\n7.

What you get with Apple product is a SAFE CHOICE. That is why it is popular. Even people with zero IT knowledge will be safe with Macbook. Because it caters to average acceptance of quality. But saying its high price is exaggeration is also incorrect. Also saying buying MBP make you immune from problem is also stupid. Its electronic. It might fail, or not. The spec will ALWAYS be out of date after a year. You may use the same Macbook for 10 years, but at the SAME COST, you can have an UPDATED specs of a Windows laptop every 3 or so years.

The tablet should have decent battery life (allowing for about 5 hours of note-taking), with a cross-platform software that can let me view/edit the notes offline on a Linux machine. OCR recognition would be a huge bonus.\n\nMy options are:\n\n1. Build my own desktop/get a good workstation/Linux-friendly laptop with great specs (i7, 16GB RAM) and load Linux on it. For a portable device, get a good Android tab, like one of the Galaxy Note, with an option to use any software I want for notes. \n\n2. Go for the Surface Pro. Install Linux on it (as the good folks over at [r/SurfaceLinux/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurfaceLinux/) have tried) and hope it is still as easy to use when using it as a tab. Downside is that it may not be as powerful a computer unless I go for the expensive Surface Book.\n\n3. Swallow it and switch to a Mac + iPad. This is the least preferred of my options since I have been dissuading my mother and sister for a while from buying Apple products because of their closed-market policies.

The tablet should have decent battery life (allowing for about 5 hours of note-taking), with a cross-platform software that can let me view/edit the notes offline on a Linux machine. OCR recognition would be a huge bonus.\n\nMy options are:\n\n1. Build my own desktop/get a good workstation/Linux-friendly laptop with great specs (i7, 16GB RAM) and load Linux on it. For a portable device, get a good Android tab, like one of the Galaxy Note, with an option to use any software I want for notes. \n\n2. Go for the Surface Pro. Install Linux on it (as the good folks over at [r/SurfaceLinux/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurfaceLinux/) have tried) and hope it is still as easy to use when using it as a tab. Downside is that it may not be as powerful a computer unless I go for the expensive Surface Book.\n\n3. Swallow it and switch to a Mac + iPad. This is the least preferred of my options since I have been dissuading my mother and sister for a while from buying Apple products because of their closed-market policies.

SCART was an early connection standard used mostly in Europe that was a bit like the bulky analog version of HDMI, carrying both sound and video on the same connector.  The important bit is that it supported multiple video connections, including one that gives you separate signals for Red, Green, and Blue.  Separate RGB gives you the absolute best video quality you can get on original hardware, so it's the best option if you're converting to anything else.  Most consoles from the Genesis/SNES era and up supported SCART with full RGB.  Grab an SCART hookup for your favorite console plus an SCART -> HDMI converter and you'll be getting the absolute best image quality you can out of your old game systems.  Plus, as a bonus, SCART accessories are ridiculously cheap, since they were overproduced.\n\n**TL;DR:** It's better to output to SCART RGB and use a separate SCART -> HDMI converter, which will give you phenomenal video quality and is pretty cheap to boot.", "id": "d9rxj9x"}, {"comment": "The port was the same as the Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 joystick port...not really proprietary.", "id": "d9rgt9q"}, {"comment": "The DE9 was also used on a bunch of lesser known consoles, too.", "id": "d9ruoua"}, {"comment": "The cost is NOT LOW in any way.

There, you have big options at the top to \"uninstall\" or \"force stop,\" but if you scroll down you also have a space that says \"notifications.\"  If you click that, you should now have a window that has an option to \"block all,\" \"treat as priority,\" and \"allow peeking.\" Choose \"Block All.\" That app should now not bother you. I say *Should* because some apps, that are \"ad supported\" throw out crazy methods to inject ads onto your device (methods that *should* have them removed from Google Play). \n\nDo you close your apps when you are done? The bottom middle circle is the 'home\" button, but that can still leave apps in memory.

My wife and I stopped in to a Microsoft store in our local mall before a movie the other day to try out Microsoft Surface Studio. The user experience was not good.\n\nOne of the features I was most interested in testing was the little puck shown in the video, which looked very cool. It didn't work well. The screen typically thought the puck was in a very different place onscreen, and clicking the puck didn't produce consistent results (it didn't produce a reliable click). I'd chalk this up to a bad system except my wife was experiencing the same thing on another unit. \n\nEven more fundamentally, the puck would not stay put on the screen even when it the Studio was reclined to its lowest level. It kept (very slowly) sliding down the screen. Even cleaning it didn't improve this. \n\nEven when it worked, the way the puck was used was mundane (everything I saw was essentially just a text-based popup menu). I'm sure that if I had configured the drawing app I was using in just the right way, I could have done something cool with it (changing the paint color dynamically as I was drawing, like in the video), but apparently Microsoft doesn't want to make that easy for customers to try.\n\nHaving said that, I give Microsoft kudos for actually trying to push desktop UI forward. The touchscreen / stylus worked well, and being able to slide the screen down makes the desktop touchscreen usable over long periods in a way that it otherwise wouldn't be. I think, however, Microsoft and the app developers haven't really figured out how to make this big touchscreen usable; standing so close to such a big screen, I found myself spending more time hunting for little icons spread around the periphery than I would on a laptop or tablet.\n\nIn another rev or two, and with better software, Studio may be both usable and cool. I agree with other sentiments here that Apple is dropping the ball on actually paying attention to desktop user experience. Although Apple also has a tendency toward \"perfection\", delaying the introduction of new hardware until they feel the user experience is just right, whereas Microsoft is more likely to rush new products out."], [6, "This looks to be a strong contender for studio based creative teams.

My wife and I stopped in to a Microsoft store in our local mall before a movie the other day to try out Microsoft Surface Studio. The user experience was not good.\n\nOne of the features I was most interested in testing was the little puck shown in the video, which looked very cool. It didn't work well. The screen typically thought the puck was in a very different place onscreen, and clicking the puck didn't produce consistent results (it didn't produce a reliable click). I'd chalk this up to a bad system except my wife was experiencing the same thing on another unit. \n\nEven more fundamentally, the puck would not stay put on the screen even when it the Studio was reclined to its lowest level. It kept (very slowly) sliding down the screen. Even cleaning it didn't improve this. \n\nEven when it worked, the way the puck was used was mundane (everything I saw was essentially just a text-based popup menu). I'm sure that if I had configured the drawing app I was using in just the right way, I could have done something cool with it (changing the paint color dynamically as I was drawing, like in the video), but apparently Microsoft doesn't want to make that easy for customers to try.\n\nHaving said that, I give Microsoft kudos for actually trying to push desktop UI forward. The touchscreen / stylus worked well, and being able to slide the screen down makes the desktop touchscreen usable over long periods in a way that it otherwise wouldn't be. I think, however, Microsoft and the app developers haven't really figured out how to make this big touchscreen usable; standing so close to such a big screen, I found myself spending more time hunting for little icons spread around the periphery than I would on a laptop or tablet.\n\nIn another rev or two, and with better software, Studio may be both usable and cool.

Two ports for all of that is too few, especially when the $1500 laptop doesn't come with adapters.\n* I can kinda understand Apple's reasoning behind the limited number of ports. When you're using the laptop away from your desk, it won't be plugged into anything--at most a flash drive and headphones. The idea is you only need one port to connect to a docking station when you're at your desk. But the thing is, Apple doesn't sell any docking stations. And they've already said they're discontinuing their Thunderbolt displays. \n* Again on the topic of expandability and ports, SD card slots are kinda necessary and are basically in a separate category than USB devices.\n* Only 16 GB RAM for the 15\" quad-core + dGPU version? 32 GB should be an option ...\n* Thinness isn't an excuse to cut on battery life!

The typical thin laptop is really lacking in ports, but even then it'll have at least two USB ports + power in + audio out + at least one video out + SD card slot. Two ports for all of that is too few, especially when the $1500 laptop doesn't come with adapters.\n* I can kinda understand Apple's reasoning behind the limited number of ports. When you're using the laptop away from your desk, it won't be plugged into anything--at most a flash drive and headphones. The idea is you only need one port to connect to a docking station when you're at your desk. But the thing is, Apple doesn't sell any docking stations. And they've already said they're discontinuing their Thunderbolt displays. \n* Again on the topic of expandability and ports, SD card slots are kinda necessary and are basically in a separate category than USB devices.\n* Only 16 GB RAM for the 15\" quad-core + dGPU version? 32 GB should be an option ...\n* Thinness isn't an excuse to cut on battery life! The 2015 13\" MBP has a 50% larger battery than the 2016 one.\n* I know this is a personal preference, but IMO if you're someone who types at around 120 WPM, the shallow keyboard just won't do. It should be fine for index-finger typists though.\n* Proprietary SSD? Seriously? At this point you're basically going out of your way to make sure people can't upgrade/repair their MacBooks.

Oh, and Apple offers great back to school discounts, and Dell only offered me a free mouse pad or something. So they were pretty neck and neck, but for my specific purposes, I thought the cheaper MacBook was better for me. I did think the XPS looked better though, I'm a fan of the black. \n\nAnd FYI, I do know Windows (and Linux) like the back of my hand. I even patented a Windows based system that integrates with the OS. If you knew anything about either OS, you'd know that while Windows still has a majority market share, in some industries, Mac has nearly 100%. For instance, graphic design and advertising are MAC dominated, while more traditional business professions and engineering is Windows. \n\nIn my opinion, the best thing about Apple is that everything in it (minus that base AMD processor) is designed and manufactured by Apple FOR that specific machine. Most Windows laptops are a conglomerate Frankenstein creation of Dell, Microsoft, AsRock, Asus, Kingston, WD, Intel, AMD, etc, and the independent parts are thrown together in an enclosure. If something isn't operating correctly in the MacBook, I know exactly who made it. If something goes wrong on the Windows laptop, the retailer will probably direct me trough 8 other channels before I find out what I need to know. Full disclosure, the XPS is 100% made through Dell, which is the reason it was my top contender against the MacBook. This was about a year and a half ago now, so since then the Microsoft SurfaceBook also came out, which is the same story (and I love that thing). \n\nBut that's another thing, desktops are way different than laptops (as I hope you'd know). I'd never buy an apple desktop because with that much space, I'm not worried about design, heat, and longevity. I'm only concerned with power. Like many of you, I've built my own desktop because I think that's the best overall route. Laptops... not so much. You know you say Apple is only for facebook, but apple doesn't make low end laptops. They may be overpriced, but they aren't low power. I can go to Walmart an buy a 300$ laptop right now. THATS a facebook machine in my opinion. Besides, what crazy software are you running that's SO much more intensive than facebook? Video editing? Engineer software?

However cocaine can be turned into a hydrochloride (neutral, a salt) in order to snort it. Moreover, there's cocaine sulfate, sometimes known as cat-piss coke, and also cocaine nitrate. The last three are made by reacting the free alkaloid/base with hydrochloric, sulfuric or nitric acid. The more popular Cocaine HCL can be 89-90% freebase cocaine, and the rest is the hydrochloride ions. Cat-piss coke is aprox 75% base and 25% sulfate ion. And the weakest, in terms of getting high is the Nitric salt, at approx 55% coca-base and 45% nitric ions.While uncut, pure cocaine nitrate salt has been responsible for people killing other people, as they didn't understand the chemistry!

Did a count ever get released?\n\nAnd I think the whole thing was exaggerated by the media.  \n\nCase and point: the man in FL that had a note 7 explode leading to his jeep catching fire, leading to the infamous picture that started this whole thing.  Well, turns out that guy had the Note 7: 1) plugged into a 3rd party, unapproved charger that was charging while his car was off, meaning no AC running, and 2) left it on his dash for hours in >150 degree heat (FL in summer + being enclosed in a not running car).  IMHO, those two factors, not the note 7 battery, were probably more likely to having caused it to catch fire.  I think the terms and conditions for the phone (i.e. battery) clearly state safe operating conditions, which do not include un-approved chargers or operating while in extreme temperatures.....but, the media picked up on it (it was the first note 7 exploding story) and sure enough another note 7 exploding story came about.... \n\nThe 2nd story was a woman in Brooklyn (i think) who's grandson (or son, I forget) had (paraphrasing) \"their note 7 explode while their grandson was playing a game, causing them to have to go to the hospital!\".  At face value, sounds terrible.  Well, turns out that it wasn't a note 7 at all, but the media had already picked up on it and the damage was done.  Soon there after, everybody and their mother was posting pictures of their note 7 damaged from fire (perhaps the majority were true, but I am positive many were simply to get social media attention for those people, just like the first two stories), the FAA banned the phone, the CSC recalled it, and done.\n\nNow, was there a problem with the note 7 battery leading it to be more susceptible to fail? perhaps, only a scientific analysis will lead to that conclusion.

No wireless charging in the new iphone, v20, moto z, HTC 10, Pixel or Nexus 6p. \n\n>or have one with a crap battery that runs out before the end of the day.\n\nSee there's another problem with your argument, usage is different for everyone. In my week with the S7 I wasn't impressed with the battery. It got me through the day on lighter usage, but if I wanted to do any gaming or generally just use my phone I had to charge before the day. You said yourself\n\n>that after taking it out for a full day to work, I can drop it on the charger, while I have a shower and get ready to go out, and it's usually nearly or fully charged before I go out for the night.\n\nI want a phone that I don't have to EVER think or worry about battery. I wanna be able to wake up with 100% play pokemonGO on my walk to work/school, little social media/texting thoughout the day, lots of bluetooth streaming and GPS always on (for google opinion surveys) and max brightness. What if I have an early morning and wanna go hangout with friends after work and don't get a chance to charge? I don't ever want to have low phone anxiety and have to curb my usage. I wanna use my phone however I want *all the time!*\n\nImo there is only one phone out right now that can do this.... The moto z play. Anywhere from 7-8 hours SOT of the most extreme usage to up to 16+ hours of more moderate usage, on wifi, not processor heavy. Throw the slim battery pack on and you have a phone that you could actually get 24 hours of SOT. Every other phone has \"crap battery\" in comparison. \n\nAlso, I don't want you to get the idea that I don't think wireless charging is convenient and I definitely want it to gain traction among other OEM's like I though it was about 2 years ago. Hopefully, with the new advancements that allow charging though metal it will be in more phones soon.

I think from empty, it would take only about 2hours, although I've never managed to get close to 0% remaining to try it.\n\nAnyway, my point is, I never find myself in a situation where current wireless charging capability fails to meet my needs.  The only thing I can envisage is if I forget to charge the thing overnight, and then come home from work with 2% charge before a night out, and I need to rapidly get that up close to full power.

Using the scale I posted above, find an image that should push the boundaries of the dynamic range; it must have something supremely bright, and also completely dark. A good test would be a snowy scene, or a bright white reflective car near an open shady barn or something. Repeat your experiment, and look at the highest and lowest zones. If the sensor is working, you should see more detail in those areas!

But even these don't factor in every possibility, nor do they always play to a processor's strengths. \n\nI guess trying to measure the performance of a CPU could in this respect be compared to trying to measure how talented a person is. A person could be a brilliant artist or an amazing athlete, yet have gotten poor grades at school and therefore be classed as inferior to those who didn't. Just because that person hasn't got 8A*s doesn't mean they are, in the end, any worse than anyone else. \n\nThis is the same with CPUs. Some have super high clock speeds, reaching over 4GHz during boost meaning it has really good single threaded performance, such as AMD's [FX-8370](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AMD-FD8370FRHKBOX-FX-8370-125W-CPU/dp/B00MUTWELC), which might make Intel's [Xeon E5-2697 v3](http://www.ebuyer.com/663263-intel-xeon-e5-2697-v3-2-60ghz-socket-lga2011-3-35mb-cache-retail-boxed-processor-bx80644e52697v3?mkwid=s_dc&pcrid=51482416739&pkw=&pmt=&gclid=Cj0KEQiA08rBBRDUn4qproqwzYMBEiQAqpznsyDmrVX2D9O_JtLMSEJ7L4Hxe7pAohdAwYRXtGkMR5caAqzX8P8HAQ) look pathetic at 2.6GHz. But the Intel processor has 28 threads, allowing it to calculate many more things at the same time, again making the AMD chip's 8 threads look rather puny in comparison.\n\nBoth of these factors make the CPU 'better', but any benchmark may put either processor out front as being 'the best' of the two, coming down to the specific computational tasks the benchmark involves. These aren't the only two factors of course, but they're the easiest to point out and explain. Some factors are much more 'fluffy' or 'subjective' and come down to decisions made during development, such as internal layouts or machine code syntax. \n\nAll this means sadly that, despite their flaws, the synthetic benchmarks are the best we can do, just like the exams that seem to rule our lives today.
