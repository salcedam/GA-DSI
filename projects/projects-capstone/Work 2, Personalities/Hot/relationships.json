I was neutral on her attendance. If she *had* been able to come, I wouldn't have minded having her, but I also had no particular desire to have her attend, since as mentioned, I barely know her.

On the one hand, someone might appreciate being thought of, even if definitely not coming, but on the other hand, I didn't want it to seem insulting in some way to invite her knowing she couldn't and wouldn't come.  \nSo I left it up to my Dad.

Because otherwise you could have awkward and resentful interactions between any and all family members for years due to this.\n\nSo, TLDR, you can choose not to invite relatives, but you have to make up for it with sincere (or sincere-sounding) apologies ahead of time or you'll be planting the seeds for drama for years to come.", "id": "darn5bo"}], [{"comment": "My brother and his wife sent me an invitation to his wedding in australia.

I would pretty advise that if you two are making decisions like this (not inviting certain relatives) then you are better off not accepting financial help from anyone so you can have the wedding that you so desire.\n\nSide Note: My husband was of the school of thought that he wasn't sure if he wanted to invite certain people because he did not think they would attend due to distance and finances. I told him that is not a reason to not send invites to friends/family. We sent invites to everyone we wanted to celebrate with. He had friends/family from the west coast (US) come to our wedding on the east coat and he's super excited that he invited them. And we actually received a wedding gift from a couple who could/did not attend the wedding celebration. We also didn't invite our mothers because we are do not have relationships with either of them and did not want them there. The morale of my story: You do what you want and how you want, especially if you're paying and you know you'll have a better time without certain people in attendance. \n\nEDIT: Did not realize how long. We just had our celebration not that long ago and I didn't invite more than half of my immediate family. They were not missed. We had more than enough friends/family who attended and had a blast!

I mean, you choose in the end.\n\n Especially for a small wedding, that kind of means explicitly narrowing your invitations to only big invites and the people you are closest to.  Them having a genetic relation doesn't necessarily justify an invite, and it's unreasonable to pressure you, if your parents are threatening.

If the only aunts and uncles you wish to exclude are the ones you think won't come - not people you actively don't want to have attend for some reason, inviting them even just as a show of care would be a pretty easy way to satisfy the etiquette without any real impact on your wedding, so I'd suggest it might be worth it.  \n\nIt sounds to me like they're looking at the standard etiquette rules and are concerned that you might offend people by not following them, and they want to prevent that, not that they're trying to impose their will.  \n\n-----\n\nPersonally, I have a very small family. I had one uncle and one aunt I knew would come to my wedding, and one aunt I knew absolutely would not.

I was neutral on her attendance. If she *had* been able to come, I wouldn't have minded having her, but I also had no particular desire to have her attend, since as mentioned, I barely know her.   So it was a question of sending her an invitation or not.   On the one hand, someone might appreciate being thought of, even if definitely not coming, but on the other hand, I didn't want it to seem insulting in some way to invite her knowing she couldn't and wouldn't come.  \nSo I left it up to my Dad.

She has commented about your ages so she clearly recognises this, and all you will do by putting that out there is pushing her towards that shitty decision it seems like neither of you want. \n\nI'd strongly advise to keep this up. Keep hanging out, keep having fun. But keep your mouth shut. Don't reveal your hand. Don't blow this with unnecessary honesty. Remember, you're not being *dis*honest, you're just choosing what to share and what not to share. There is nothing wrong with that. \n\nPeople love to talk about 'feelings' and 'honesty' and 'oppenness' and I agree, but that doesn't mean it's appropriate *all the time*.

This much, is obvious. What is not obvious, however, is the reason why she feels awkward. I can only think of a couple reason as to why she would feel this way.\n\n\nReason one: She has low self confidence, and doesn't really know how to deal with her emotions. Whether it's being busy and overwhelmed or not knowing how to gracefully receive a compliment. As a result of this she feels awkward and stupid and doesn't know what to say, hence the texting issue and being weirdly mad on the first date. \n\nReason two: She doesn't like you. This reason, is, I think the least likely. The mere fact that she even agreed to a second date is a positive sign, even if she did have to push it back. Life happens sometimes. \n\n\nIn my personal opinion, it sounds to me like this girl has a hard time dealing with her emotions, having self confidence, and has a fear of dating in general. \n\n\nMy personal recommendation to you would be to ask her out, and be blunt. You could say something to the effect of,\n\n\"Hey, (insert girl's name)! I would like to take you out on a date this Friday, if you're free. If you're not free that night I'd be willing to work around your schedule, but I don't want you to feel obligated to go out with me if you don't want to.

What is not obvious, however, is the reason why she feels awkward. I can only think of a couple reason as to why she would feel this way.\n\n\nReason one: She has low self confidence, and doesn't really know how to deal with her emotions. Whether it's being busy and overwhelmed or not knowing how to gracefully receive a compliment. As a result of this she feels awkward and stupid and doesn't know what to say, hence the texting issue and being weirdly mad on the first date. \n\nReason two: She doesn't like you. This reason, is, I think the least likely. The mere fact that she even agreed to a second date is a positive sign, even if she did have to push it back. Life happens sometimes. \n\n\nIn my personal opinion, it sounds to me like this girl has a hard time dealing with her emotions, having self confidence, and has a fear of dating in general. \n\n\nMy personal recommendation to you would be to ask her out, and be blunt. You could say something to the effect of,\n\n\"Hey, (insert girl's name)! I would like to take you out on a date this Friday, if you're free. If you're not free that night I'd be willing to work around your schedule, but I don't want you to feel obligated to go out with me if you don't want to.

I get that guys can have friends of the opposite gender, but something is just super off about making friends with girls at a party where everyone was drunk and someone flashed you. I also support your girlfriend's statement that you should have left. It doesn't matter that you didn't instigate it - if you are in a committed relationship and a situation turns sexual, even in the slightest, you need to get the fuck out of there. Don't give yourself another chance to accidentally see something. \n\nKnowing that you have contacts on your Snapchat from random girls, and that you took the phone, opened Snapchat, and gave it back - yes, that is extremely shady. Even if you didn't intend for it to look that way, that's how it would look for most people in your gf's position. \n\nThat being said, you two need to learn healthier communication. First of all, both the calling of the ex and the girl flashing you have already been hashed out and resolved. Do not bring them back up in any future fights. Ask her not to bring it up again either, and explain why. The past is meant to be left in the past. No one can be scrutinized for every mistake they have made. You either forgive and move on, or you break up. You two chose to forgive and move on, so do it. \n\nYour girlfriend might be partially insecure about her ex - but you also need to look at things from her POV. If she went to parties, got hammered, got guys' contacts, and then had some dude flash her, you would probably not be very happy. It's not all on her ex. The things you are doing look shady, even if they aren't actually. You need to decide some kind of resolution for this together, because telling her to just be trusting and forget the ex is obviously not working. Maybe she could come with you to parties (I don't know you guys' situation, so if that isn't possible, you need to come up with something else ASAP). Perhaps you need to promise that you will not collect numbers. Maybe you need to promise to leave if another situation ever turns sexual, even if it is not you fault that it turned that way. \n\nYou two need to learn the really important things to get mad over and what to let go of - I don't know if the joke thing or something similar is a regular occurrence, but getting mad over a joke is too much.

Not exactly the same, but similar enough. Always broke, always making shitty choices, always coming to me to bail her out (which I did, because she had kids, what kind of monster would let her kids go hungry, right? Even though she always had money for weed...) And then she'd take my money, and go right back to making shitty choices. The day I tried to set a teensy-weensy boundary, and tell her that I could no longer give her money, all hell broke loose, and she called me every name in the book, and guilt-tripped the shit out of me for being soooo cruel to her poor kids (Because of course it was my fault she spent all her money on weed and cigarettes and her kids had no shoes.)\n\nHere's what I learned. No matter how nice you are, no matter how kind you are, no matter how gently you phrase things, no matter how much you love Pam and express it and are good to her - it does not matter. Pam is not in a headspace to take responsibility for herself and her actions - no matter WHAT you do or don't do - it is ALL YOUR FAULT. So if you pull away from her (and you have to), Pam will throw a tantrum, and she will pull MAJOR guilt trips. How can you do this to her? How can you do this to her babies? They are STARVING, and you are abandoning them! If they starve to death, it's YOUR fault! All she needs is a friend, and you are turning your back on her, like a monster! All she's ever given you is love, and this is how you repay her? Or - my favorite - \"If the situation were reversed, I'd be there for YOU. I'd support YOU. I'd loan money to YOU.\" <--- This is always said by people who will never, ever be in a position to support me or lend money to me, so of COURSE they can promise it! \n\nYou have to break free, and NOT WORRY about what she says or thinks of you, because believe me, she will say and think the worst, no matter what. Whether you scream a string of insults at her and try to set her on fire, or whether you say \"Pam, I love you dearly, and I think the world of you,\" and then try to set one tiny boundary from there- it doesn't matter, the result will be the same. Pam will go absolutely apeshit, call you every name in the book, pull INSANE guilt trips, make you think that you are literally pulling food from her children's mouths, and make YOU responsible for her shitty life, her tears, her failures, global warming, whatever. It will be ALL YOUR FAULT. \n\nBut you have to cut her out of your life. She is nothing but bad news. \n\nAlso, remember this - by keeping her in your life, you are being NICE, but you're not being KIND. If I have an important work presentation to do and I have on a terrible dress, and I say \"How do I look?\" The NICE thing to say is \"Oh, you look good in anything.\" The KIND thing to do is say \"Hm, what else do you have in your closet?\" Even though it might hurt my feelings. \n\nBy being nice to her, and letting her in, and giving her food, and letting her vent, you are not allowing her to learn the hard life lessons that she may need to learn. Maybe the only way she'll get out of this relationship is to fall so hard that she finally realizes she has to get OUT. Or maybe once she is no longer enjoying all of the attention she gets from venting to you, she'll be faced with the cold loneliness of reality, and she will make the changes she needs to make to get out. She will never change if you keep  allowing her to come to you. \n\nSo the KIND thing to do is cut her out. \n\nI might just flat-out tell her. \n\n\"Pam, right now, I am dealing with my own issues, and I really need to take a break. I can't hang out or talk on the phone. I'd appreciate it if you respected my boundaries.\" \n\nOR\n\n\"Pam, this is all too much for me. I'd like to ask you not to come by or call me anymore. I understand you're in a bad spot but you're going to have to deal with this on you're own. I won't be answering my phone or opening my door to you.\" \n\nAnd that's that.

Always broke, always making shitty choices, always coming to me to bail her out (which I did, because she had kids, what kind of monster would let her kids go hungry, right? Even though she always had money for weed...) And then she'd take my money, and go right back to making shitty choices. The day I tried to set a teensy-weensy boundary, and tell her that I could no longer give her money, all hell broke loose, and she called me every name in the book, and guilt-tripped the shit out of me for being soooo cruel to her poor kids (Because of course it was my fault she spent all her money on weed and cigarettes and her kids had no shoes.)\n\nHere's what I learned. No matter how nice you are, no matter how kind you are, no matter how gently you phrase things, no matter how much you love Pam and express it and are good to her - it does not matter. Pam is not in a headspace to take responsibility for herself and her actions - no matter WHAT you do or don't do - it is ALL YOUR FAULT. So if you pull away from her (and you have to), Pam will throw a tantrum, and she will pull MAJOR guilt trips. How can you do this to her? How can you do this to her babies? They are STARVING, and you are abandoning them! If they starve to death, it's YOUR fault! All she needs is a friend, and you are turning your back on her, like a monster! All she's ever given you is love, and this is how you repay her? Or - my favorite - \"If the situation were reversed, I'd be there for YOU. I'd support YOU. I'd loan money to YOU.\" <--- This is always said by people who will never, ever be in a position to support me or lend money to me, so of COURSE they can promise it! \n\nYou have to break free, and NOT WORRY about what she says or thinks of you, because believe me, she will say and think the worst, no matter what. Whether you scream a string of insults at her and try to set her on fire, or whether you say \"Pam, I love you dearly, and I think the world of you,\" and then try to set one tiny boundary from there- it doesn't matter, the result will be the same. Pam will go absolutely apeshit, call you every name in the book, pull INSANE guilt trips, make you think that you are literally pulling food from her children's mouths, and make YOU responsible for her shitty life, her tears, her failures, global warming, whatever. It will be ALL YOUR FAULT. \n\nBut you have to cut her out of your life. She is nothing but bad news. \n\nAlso, remember this - by keeping her in your life, you are being NICE, but you're not being KIND. If I have an important work presentation to do and I have on a terrible dress, and I say \"How do I look?\" The NICE thing to say is \"Oh, you look good in anything.\" The KIND thing to do is say \"Hm, what else do you have in your closet?\" Even though it might hurt my feelings. \n\nBy being nice to her, and letting her in, and giving her food, and letting her vent, you are not allowing her to learn the hard life lessons that she may need to learn. Maybe the only way she'll get out of this relationship is to fall so hard that she finally realizes she has to get OUT. Or maybe once she is no longer enjoying all of the attention she gets from venting to you, she'll be faced with the cold loneliness of reality, and she will make the changes she needs to make to get out. She will never change if you keep  allowing her to come to you. \n\nSo the KIND thing to do is cut her out. \n\nI might just flat-out tell her. \n\n\"Pam, right now, I am dealing with my own issues, and I really need to take a break. I can't hang out or talk on the phone. I'd appreciate it if you respected my boundaries.\" \n\nOR\n\n\"Pam, this is all too much for me. I'd like to ask you not to come by or call me anymore. I understand you're in a bad spot but you're going to have to deal with this on you're own. I won't be answering my phone or opening my door to you.\" \n\nAnd that's that. Block her calls, and don't answer the door. IF you do, and it's her, close the door in her face.

I am a strong, intelligent and decisive person, and I was in the same situation at around your age. It doesn't reflect on me in a macro sense, and it shouldn't reflect on you, either. Think of the scenario with the frog in the pot of boiling water - the frog would leap out immediately if you just tossed it into a boiling pot, but if you gradually turn up the heat, the frog doesn't percieve the change until it is already cooking in its own skin.

Instead, let the default be \"I trust myself and my instincts.\" If you make mistakes other bad decisions along the way, you will have to bear the consequences and learn from them. However, those consequences and lessons are more valuable and easier to bear in the long run than a lifetime of doubting yourself. Trust.

Firstly I appreciate all the feedback. \n\nA few points I think were missed and important for context:\n\n 1) This does not happen every time she is not horny. For the majority of the time, when she or I are not horny we both simply snuggle and go to sleep.\n2) 6 such incidents of what she's described has happened over our year plus of being together. \n3) Yes at those moments I'm asking her to 'rally' but I'm not expecting sex or full on freakiness. At least I'm looking for her to breath in my ear while I masturbate. \n\nI acknowledge that I am putting her out by asking her to help me at these random times. I acknowledge that she feels pressured or obligated to help me. I agree if this was a common occurrence or if every time she wasn't horny I acted this way that it would be borderline, if not, abusive. \n\nWhat I mean by 'rally' during these, to-date, 6 moments, is that I really need some type of engagement to get off. I can't express why or explain the odd feeling but it seems necessary at the time; it's almost like a desire to be validated or assured she's there. I'm not looking for sex or to fuck her face. I'm fine with her snuggling up and simply breathing in my ear while I jack off. \n\nThis is where we come to a head, she feels I'm ignoring her feelings of being pressured etc. Where to me this is a very random occurrence but when it does happen I really need some type of support and feel rejected and hurt that she would feel I'm pressuring her. She knows I'm a good person, that I love and care for her more than anyone I ever have before, support her 100% in every aspect of life plus any of her wishes, aspirations, dreams, goals, wants or desires. This is not a common occurrence and 99% of the time if she is not horny it's no problem and we go to sleep. For that 1% of these times when I ask for help and she rejects it and it becomes a problem, I admit I am feeling needy, down, or lacking confidence and I'm not proud of that but her rejecting me and playing the 'I'm forcing her' card when she knows I'm not that type of person at all, frustrates me and leaves me feeling hurt. \n\nWe have open communication and talk about everything.

Firstly I appreciate all the feedback. \n\nA few points I think were missed and important for context:\n\n 1) This does not happen every time she is not horny. For the majority of the time, when she or I are not horny we both simply snuggle and go to sleep.\n2) 6 such incidents of what she's described has happened over our year plus of being together. \n3) Yes at those moments I'm asking her to 'rally' but I'm not expecting sex or full on freakiness. At least I'm looking for her to breath in my ear while I masturbate. \n\nI acknowledge that I am putting her out by asking her to help me at these random times. I acknowledge that she feels pressured or obligated to help me. I agree if this was a common occurrence or if every time she wasn't horny I acted this way that it would be borderline, if not, abusive. \n\nWhat I mean by 'rally' during these, to-date, 6 moments, is that I really need some type of engagement to get off. I can't express why or explain the odd feeling but it seems necessary at the time; it's almost like a desire to be validated or assured she's there. I'm not looking for sex or to fuck her face. I'm fine with her snuggling up and simply breathing in my ear while I jack off. \n\nThis is where we come to a head, she feels I'm ignoring her feelings of being pressured etc. Where to me this is a very random occurrence but when it does happen I really need some type of support and feel rejected and hurt that she would feel I'm pressuring her. She knows I'm a good person, that I love and care for her more than anyone I ever have before, support her 100% in every aspect of life plus any of her wishes, aspirations, dreams, goals, wants or desires. This is not a common occurrence and 99% of the time if she is not horny it's no problem and we go to sleep. For that 1% of these times when I ask for help and she rejects it and it becomes a problem, I admit I am feeling needy, down, or lacking confidence and I'm not proud of that but her rejecting me and playing the 'I'm forcing her' card when she knows I'm not that type of person at all, frustrates me and leaves me feeling hurt. \n\nWe have open communication and talk about everything.

Out of maybe a dozen or so girls I have been with, this was the most passionate relationship I have ever been in. She meant the world to me. I thought I meant the world to her as well. I was the first person who is not a professional psychiatrist that she told the truth about her father too...\n\nShe had issues with her sexuality, because she was molested and raped by her father for the majority of her life. These type of things also leave the victims with a high sex drive. She told me that she was bisexual, but she had never acted upon it because she was just coming to terms with her childhood and trying to heal.\n\nShe wanted to experiment, at least that's what her lie was... We had a monogamous relationship beyond a doubt. Despite the fact that I'm a bit of an awkward social outcast, she was jealous that there were pretty girls in my university program with me. They might has well have been invisible to me, I only had eyes for her.\n\nShe wasn't stupid, so I know that she knew what I meant when I gave her permission to experiment sexually with women, but I warned her that the moment it became more than that, the moment it became romantic, we would have to sit down and have a talk. Obviously she would have to at that point choose between me and the other person, but I never said that to her, I loved her too much to actually tell her that she might end up getting such an ultimatum.\n\nThere were two girls that she was into near the end of our relationship. The first one I knew a lot about, she actually would come over and hang out with us in my apartment before this whole experimentation thing started. I never liked this girl, she treated me like crap whenever she came over... In my own home! This girl turned my ex-girlfriend down, and the day that this happened my ex-girlfriend was so upset she reminded me of a young child experiencing being turned down by their very first crush. Nothing like someone in a loving relationship being given permission to learn more about them self. It made me feel worthless, it made me feel like a shitty consolation prize.\n\nThe second girl that she pursued, my ex-girlfriend kept everything about one a secret. One night she told me she was going to be out late drinking, but that I would see her when she was done for the night. It got extremely late, more than two hours past last call. At first I worried about her safety, I was worried that something happened to her on her way home! But then it dawned on me... She probably fell asleep in someone else's loving embrace... I did not get angry, I was sad, I was devastated, I was heartbroken... Obviously because of what happened with the first girl, I knew where this was going...\n\nAll I said was that it occurred to me that she maybe fell asleep in someone else's arms, I told her that I just wanted her to come home because at that moment I didn't feel like she actually loved me. She got very angry and cold... Every single word that she said to me broke my heart even further... I couldn't even face her... I never saw her face ever again. She came and got her belongings. Months went by, I knew that I loved her... That my love was real, so after a while I thought maybe things cooled down. I tried to reach out to her. She had blocked me, but I left her voicemail a few times a week, telling her how my life was going... Because you know, if she actually cared about me, she might want to know...\n\nShe must have felt guilty, somewhere inside herself... Because eventually she responded. She did not take any responsibility for anything, she didn't really even want to discuss it. She just said that we were both too immature, and that maybe one day when we were more mature we could be friends again... all that rightful anger I could have felt eventually creep up on me, I put her in her place. I felt bad even though truth to everything I said, I may be sent her one or two emails since... But I will never send her another for the rest of my life. It is sad writing that, but I know it's for the best.\n\nI don't know about her (actually I do, but I don't need to call her immature, her actions speak more than loud enough), but I consider myself to be a very mature person. I have almost always felt this way. The exception being when I was younger,  I was a very annoying kid , it was the only way I could get attention. It's almost like I'm cursed... during one Christmas my parents and my sister and my brother-in-law all decided on a movie to go see without my input whatsoever while I was in the washroom. When I got back they were talking about show times and I had asked 3 times what movie we were going to see, looking from person to person seeing if anyone would listen to me... I eventually had to raise my voice and practically yellow the question at them. When I was in public and high school I always felt more comfortable with friends in the grade above me. My parents were also very immature, and still are.\n\n**Some people just aren't good people. I am sorry that you fell in love with someone like this. She is not worthy of your love, someday you will realize that. But... Until then, I am so sorry for you, you are the victim yet you are the one who is going to be suffering...

I can empathize, albeit only a tiny fraction in comparison.\n\nI dated a girl for 9 months. Out of maybe a dozen or so girls I have been with, this was the most passionate relationship I have ever been in. She meant the world to me. I thought I meant the world to her as well. I was the first person who is not a professional psychiatrist that she told the truth about her father too...\n\nShe had issues with her sexuality, because she was molested and raped by her father for the majority of her life. These type of things also leave the victims with a high sex drive. She told me that she was bisexual, but she had never acted upon it because she was just coming to terms with her childhood and trying to heal.\n\nShe wanted to experiment, at least that's what her lie was... We had a monogamous relationship beyond a doubt. Despite the fact that I'm a bit of an awkward social outcast, she was jealous that there were pretty girls in my university program with me. They might has well have been invisible to me, I only had eyes for her.\n\nShe wasn't stupid, so I know that she knew what I meant when I gave her permission to experiment sexually with women, but I warned her that the moment it became more than that, the moment it became romantic, we would have to sit down and have a talk. Obviously she would have to at that point choose between me and the other person, but I never said that to her, I loved her too much to actually tell her that she might end up getting such an ultimatum.\n\nThere were two girls that she was into near the end of our relationship. The first one I knew a lot about, she actually would come over and hang out with us in my apartment before this whole experimentation thing started. I never liked this girl, she treated me like crap whenever she came over... In my own home! This girl turned my ex-girlfriend down, and the day that this happened my ex-girlfriend was so upset she reminded me of a young child experiencing being turned down by their very first crush. Nothing like someone in a loving relationship being given permission to learn more about them self. It made me feel worthless, it made me feel like a shitty consolation prize.\n\nThe second girl that she pursued, my ex-girlfriend kept everything about one a secret. One night she told me she was going to be out late drinking, but that I would see her when she was done for the night. It got extremely late, more than two hours past last call. At first I worried about her safety, I was worried that something happened to her on her way home! But then it dawned on me... She probably fell asleep in someone else's loving embrace... I did not get angry, I was sad, I was devastated, I was heartbroken... Obviously because of what happened with the first girl, I knew where this was going...\n\nAll I said was that it occurred to me that she maybe fell asleep in someone else's arms, I told her that I just wanted her to come home because at that moment I didn't feel like she actually loved me. She got very angry and cold... Every single word that she said to me broke my heart even further... I couldn't even face her... I never saw her face ever again. She came and got her belongings. Months went by, I knew that I loved her... That my love was real, so after a while I thought maybe things cooled down. I tried to reach out to her. She had blocked me, but I left her voicemail a few times a week, telling her how my life was going... Because you know, if she actually cared about me, she might want to know...\n\nShe must have felt guilty, somewhere inside herself... Because eventually she responded. She did not take any responsibility for anything, she didn't really even want to discuss it. She just said that we were both too immature, and that maybe one day when we were more mature we could be friends again... all that rightful anger I could have felt eventually creep up on me, I put her in her place. I felt bad even though truth to everything I said, I may be sent her one or two emails since... But I will never send her another for the rest of my life. It is sad writing that, but I know it's for the best.\n\nI don't know about her (actually I do, but I don't need to call her immature, her actions speak more than loud enough), but I consider myself to be a very mature person. I have almost always felt this way. The exception being when I was younger,  I was a very annoying kid , it was the only way I could get attention. It's almost like I'm cursed... during one Christmas my parents and my sister and my brother-in-law all decided on a movie to go see without my input whatsoever while I was in the washroom. When I got back they were talking about show times and I had asked 3 times what movie we were going to see, looking from person to person seeing if anyone would listen to me... I eventually had to raise my voice and practically yellow the question at them. When I was in public and high school I always felt more comfortable with friends in the grade above me. My parents were also very immature, and still are.\n\n**Some people just aren't good people. I am sorry that you fell in love with someone like this. She is not worthy of your love, someday you will realize that. But... Until then, I am so sorry for you, you are the victim yet you are the one who is going to be suffering...

Tell him that you love him so much. Ask him if he has any questions. Answer them as best you can. Do not be afraid to cry as it will show him it's ok to be upset. He may cry when you do- just hug him and remind him that you love him and everything is going to be OK. \n\nThen take his mind off it as best you can. Go and get ice cream or go to the park or something, and tell him that if he ever wants to talk about his dad, he can. \n\nOver the coming days/weeks he may well express confusion of his dad not returning. That's normal and there's not much you can do except gently reminding him that his daddy is not going to come home, but you're going to look after him just like daddy used to, and that if he's sad it's ok to cry. He may be very sad OR he may surprise you by taking it very well, and it may be a long time before he truly realises what death means and becomes upset. There's no real way to tell how he's going to react.\n\nDo look into getting him into grief counselling, as that's important.

Tell him that he's moved on to a better place and is gonna be looking down at him from there so that the child has hope and isn't gonna be overtaken by the grief of loss that he has endured.

I'll dive right in. 6 months or so ago I became friends with Jessica (name changed). I was a regular at the art studio she managed and when I applied for an opening there and got the job, we became fast friends. I've worked there ever since and we often work long shifts alone together. We get along very well and it's always fun; we listen to music, we paint, we have a groovy time always. I consider her to be very close to me now and she feels the same.\n\n A month or so ago, I moved into the unit next door to Jessica when my lease was up so now we're neighbors as well as coworkers and friends. Our place is a bit of a hippie commune. My house shares a wall with one of her walls, and we tend the communal garden together too. But moving on, here's what happened tonight:\n Jessica and I worked from 12-6. Her car is broken down, so we left work together and headed to a local venue to see some live music before heading home. We ended up drinking a little too much there, stopped at a local brewery after the show, and got even more drunk. At this point we had met up with some guys we know, one of which was in the band playing earlier.\n\n I think it's important to mention that I'm in a long distance, committed relationship and will be moving almost across country to be with my boyfriend early next year. However, Jessica is the opposite. She plays the field on tinder, sleeps around, and was definitely working her magic at the brewery tonight. At one point I went off in a corner to text my boyfriend while I watched Jessica alternative between a few men who I knew she'd be choosing from when deciding who to bring home. \n\n Here's where shit hits the fan. Jessica, two men, and I, start a game of corn-hole. The next thing I know, I'm falling violently to the ground completely out of nowhere. Jessica had pushed me straight to the ground, completely out of nowhere. One second she was happy and tipsy, the next moment she was competing for blood and decided to shove me into the ground and I have no idea why. My phone screen is shattered, my knees are bloody, and my hands are skinned from catching myself. After she pushed me, I walked out and got to my car and left. What do, Reddit?

You said you drank too much at the local venue and went to the brewery. It doesn't sound like you walked but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

Especially when it comes out of the blue, and you have nothing leading up to the shove or after the shove that suggests her motivation?(You've said that she might've thought that you were interfering with the two guys, but you seem to be assigning motivation after the matter.) I'd talk to her, and decide whether to give her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThird, if you think that it is her fault - stay away from her. You don't need that sort of crap. Decide whether you want to pursue the cost of the phone screen. You do live near each other and work together for long hours. It might be worth it in the long run to let this slide.\n\nFinally, and most importantly - don't get in your car if you've been drinking. "], [17, "Did you get in that car drunk OP?

However, Jessica is the opposite. She plays the field on tinder, sleeps around, and was definitely working her magic at the brewery tonight. At one point I went off in a corner to text my boyfriend while I watched Jessica alternative between a few men who I knew she'd be choosing from when deciding who to bring home. \n\n Here's where shit hits the fan. Jessica, two men, and I, start a game of corn-hole. The next thing I know, I'm falling violently to the ground completely out of nowhere. Jessica had pushed me straight to the ground, completely out of nowhere. One second she was happy and tipsy, the next moment she was competing for blood and decided to shove me into the ground and I have no idea why. My phone screen is shattered, my knees are bloody, and my hands are skinned from catching myself. After she pushed me, I walked out and got to my car and left. What do, Reddit? How do I handle this sort of thing in a relatively new friendship? Should I at least get her to pay for my phone screen? Should I just accept that she was drunk and thought I somehow was fucking up her ability to get laid?

You said you drank too much at the local venue and went to the brewery. It doesn't sound like you walked but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.

I'd talk to her, and decide whether to give her the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThird, if you think that it is her fault - stay away from her. You don't need that sort of crap. Decide whether you want to pursue the cost of the phone screen. You do live near each other and work together for long hours.

It's enough of a hassle to transfer and a short enough time that I'd probably only ask once--either ask for enough to cover the week and tell them you'll leave anything that's left over, or save receipts and ask for reimbursement at the end.

If the OP refused to feed the children because they only left her $50, that'd be nonproductive, harmful passive-aggression.\n\nSometimes, and this is hard for me personally because it feels manipulative and deceitful, you need to grease the skids a little bit and dance around issues when you're dealing with someone who is lacking social graces of their own.

Then Dec 1st came and went and I still hadn't budged. But I was running out of excuses. Finally, she came to me open-hearted and told me how much it would mean to her if we got one. Asshole that I am, I stood by my \"no.\" But she had touched me, and I thought and thought about it. And I went out-- alone, and without her knowledge-- and bought a table top, artificial tree. And a set of lights for it. I spent maybe $25 total. And it had to take up most of our dining table. I had it up and lit as a surprise when she came home from work.

I'm really sorry."], [1, "So my aunt has dementia and so does my boyfriends grandmother. Hers is more the \"mean\" kind. She was diagnosed last year and it got worse really quickly, it was really hard to watch. Anyone here telling you that your grandmother's behavior is just because she's a mean person is totally wrong and clearly doesn't understand much about the disease. She may not have been the nicest person to begin with but dementia can make even the nicest people say they meanest things, its a common side effect in the progression of the disease. All the stuff she's saying to you and doing to you is the disease talking. I know it's hard but you have to keep telling yourself that and try not to take it personally. My BFs grandmother lashed out more at his brother than him, and the home care nurses. She went from being a sweet old lady to trying to attack a nurse with a kitchen knife in under a year. The thing is though was that she was still extremely lucid about a lot of things. She could carry on conversations and remember a lot of things, she recognized everybody, but she still had all these delusions about things that she thought were happening. She eventually progressed to  visual and auditory hallucinations. Some days were better than others. But there were days where she was just mean and angry. My BF just had to keep telling himself that his grandmother was gone. That she wasn't the same person anymore. I'm sorry you're going through this. Dementia is so hard on the families of people who have it, sometimes worse for them than for the people affected. Unfortunately it's only going to get worse. I think you will have to work towards accepting that the grandmother you knew is gone. Its ok to be sad about it, its ok to mourn the loss, grieving is healthy. There is no use trying to reason with her or explain things to her, she doesn't have the capacity to understand or change her mind anymore and it will only make you more upset. That is the hardest thing about dealing with this, it makes you feel powerless. I think going forward you will have to decide if quantity of time with her is more important than quality of time. What i mean by that is that it might be better for you if you don't spend much time with her, that way your good memories of her won't be tarnished by they way she is now. I know it has been a lot easier for my BF now that is grandmother has moved out of state with his uncle (her son). He misses her and still loves her very much, but seeing her so mean and angry and saying crazy things all the time was really hard on him emotionally and mentally. Even now i can tell when he's talked to her on the phone because it just makes him sad the whole day. It might help you to do some research online, there are a lot of forums and support groups for family members of people with dementia, it might help you to talk to people who are going trough the same thing. There might even be a subreddit but I'm not sure. As long as she's getting the care she needs from others, you have to take into account your own emotional well being. If being around her and receiving abuse from her is too hard, thats ok. And it's ok to limit contact with her to give yourself some relief, it's not selfish. Again I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. It's such a terrible disease, but you're not alone.

Even though I loved her very much, she was a manipulative, petty, self-centered person her whole life. She was either being the sweetest person alive, or absolutely vicious. When her dementia began to really set in, she turned all her vitriol on my family, but offered nothing but praise to my cousins and uncle.\n\nAt first, I tried to fight it. I would try to reason with her. I would point out the flaws in her logic, convinced that if I could just prove that she was being irrational, she would stop with all the anger and hatred. What would start out as us pleasantly going for breakfast would end with me in tears, desperately trying to defend myself and my mother from bizarre accusations and fabricated slights. The most frustrating thing was **she didn't display a lot of other symptoms** - since she wasn't calling people by her childhood neighbor's name or wondering across town with no shoes, it took time for any of us to really understand what was happening, and accept that she was no longer as cognitively capable as she once was.\n\nEventually I realized that this was a futile effort. Trying to argue only made it worse, because **dementia is not something you can reason with**.

Tell her you love her, and let it be. (I used to intentionally call when I knew my grandma wouldn't be able to answer so I could just leave her a nice voicemail). Instead of arguing, save yourself the frustration and politely disengage, because even when you're right, you cannot win. **It's better to have small, positive memories, than drawn-out, painful ones.** Remember that her criticisms are coming from someone unable to accurately process her surroundings - don't let your self-worth be collateral damage to this awful disease.\n\nI am so sorry this is happening to you, OP.

Hers is more the \"mean\" kind. She was diagnosed last year and it got worse really quickly, it was really hard to watch. Anyone here telling you that your grandmother's behavior is just because she's a mean person is totally wrong and clearly doesn't understand much about the disease. She may not have been the nicest person to begin with but dementia can make even the nicest people say they meanest things, its a common side effect in the progression of the disease. All the stuff she's saying to you and doing to you is the disease talking. I know it's hard but you have to keep telling yourself that and try not to take it personally. My BFs grandmother lashed out more at his brother than him, and the home care nurses. She went from being a sweet old lady to trying to attack a nurse with a kitchen knife in under a year. The thing is though was that she was still extremely lucid about a lot of things. She could carry on conversations and remember a lot of things, she recognized everybody, but she still had all these delusions about things that she thought were happening. She eventually progressed to  visual and auditory hallucinations. Some days were better than others. But there were days where she was just mean and angry. My BF just had to keep telling himself that his grandmother was gone. That she wasn't the same person anymore. I'm sorry you're going through this. Dementia is so hard on the families of people who have it, sometimes worse for them than for the people affected. Unfortunately it's only going to get worse. I think you will have to work towards accepting that the grandmother you knew is gone. Its ok to be sad about it, its ok to mourn the loss, grieving is healthy. There is no use trying to reason with her or explain things to her, she doesn't have the capacity to understand or change her mind anymore and it will only make you more upset. That is the hardest thing about dealing with this, it makes you feel powerless. I think going forward you will have to decide if quantity of time with her is more important than quality of time. What i mean by that is that it might be better for you if you don't spend much time with her, that way your good memories of her won't be tarnished by they way she is now. I know it has been a lot easier for my BF now that is grandmother has moved out of state with his uncle (her son). He misses her and still loves her very much, but seeing her so mean and angry and saying crazy things all the time was really hard on him emotionally and mentally. Even now i can tell when he's talked to her on the phone because it just makes him sad the whole day. It might help you to do some research online, there are a lot of forums and support groups for family members of people with dementia, it might help you to talk to people who are going trough the same thing. There might even be a subreddit but I'm not sure. As long as she's getting the care she needs from others, you have to take into account your own emotional well being. If being around her and receiving abuse from her is too hard, thats ok. And it's ok to limit contact with her to give yourself some relief, it's not selfish. Again I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. It's such a terrible disease, but you're not alone.

If you still dealing with financial problems, better you don't have any kids then. Every aspect of life would be difficult and complicated if you insist on having them. Let alone fact that you prefer to not have children at all, it may be chore for you to raise a kid if you aren't ready to have he/she in the first place. Don't forget that that dickhead wouldn't be much help and he certainly isn't someone to rely on. Being father is much more than just petty insecurity and video games. I'm sure every kids out there don't want their father cheats on their mom either. Huhh, I tell you something, friend. He's not the one for you. And about your parents, I suggest you to not tell them about your pregnancy. It would makes things harder if they already know, though. It's almost a dead end for you, but really you still have choice even its consequences will follow just after. Think and consider carefully about this matter. The world isn't going to over and you can make yourself a better life. It's your life to live and it's your choice to make. Make yourself happy in this short period life. Break up with him first then have the abortion, it's the best thing that I can come out with. He's not a keeper. Dump him. It will be a good start. Goodluck with the abortion (in case you are really going to do it). I'm sure there are many lovely and kind ladies who will share their stories with you. I wish an eternal happiness for your life.

From your description  boyfriend it seems as though he is not a person that you have enough respect for to have him be the father. If you continue with the pregnancy it sounds like he will either continue to be manipulative or possibly even emotionally abusive if you allow him to take part. So you have to decide if you do want him to be the father (which regardless means you are tied to him for he rest of your life), if you want to raise a child in your current financial and career place as a single mother, or if you feel it would be better for the child to not be burdened with this. It is your choice how you want your life to go, but from what you said if I felt the same pressures my instincts tell me I would dump this asshole, and terminate the pregnancy or place the child up for adoption. I don't see any reason for this man to be a part of a child's life at the moment. It seems as though he wants it because it ties you two together and maybe he thinks it will fix things.

GUY lobs this grenade at you.\n\nThe cynical side of me says that this isn't an honest baring of his soul to you so much as it is emotional brinksmanship. Essentially he's packed together this really complicated ball of feelings, ideas and suggestions and is hurling it at you in the hopes that you'll catch it without time to pick it all apart. Then once you've caught it, you're swept right back into the fast moving current of this relationship so you're never going to spend time picking at all the things you've just subconciously accepted into the foundations of your relationship.\n\nWhat makes me lean this way?\n\n1. At the very least his cheating with prostitutes reveals that he is able to compartmentalize and rationalize his behavior to justify what he wants. After all, he told you that at the time he was cheating with prostitutes he still wanted to salvage his marriage (which is a little like someone telling you they don't want to burn their house down while they set fire to their couch).\n\n2. Everything you know about his relationship with his wife is filtered through him and he is the hero of his own story. I'm also just naturally wary of anyone that just says \"my ex was crazy\" even if they do couch it in terms of vague mental illness.\n\n3. The potential for \"love bombing\" (as you said, you feel like you might be getting very close so very quickly, and that can be a tactic that shitty people use to get you invested while you're still in a haze)\n\nThat all might be way off base, but at the very least he should be able to respect the fact that you might want to slow things down so you can sort your feels.", "id": "dar5o0f"}, {"comment": "Thank you for your reply. It's really helpful.\n\nHis divorce date is actually quite soon. I'm a child of divorce so I realize that the emotional connection is often gone long before the actual separation, and that divorce precedings take a fair while (a year in this case).

Even when they are sober, if they are not in therapy, they are often very difficult people to have relationships with because the root of alcoholism is a mental illness characterized by exaggerated selfishness and stubbornness, and is often accompanied by a worldview of perpetual victimhood and self pity (which is what leads to self medication through drinking). \n\nAlcoholics can be some of the most mindbendingly toxic and abusive people you'll ever meet -- loving and warm one minute, cruel and twisted the next. Deciet, a lack of self control, gaslighting, stonewalling, verbal and emotional abuse, manipulation, nonsensical arguments, unreliability, financial instability, and impulsiveness are just some of the most common things you may deal with when in a relationship with an alcoholic. \n\nDrunk driving where someone gets killed or injured, physical abuse, sexual assault, theft, fraud, property damage, major organ failure, and suicide are the end result for alcoholics who don't receive and continue treatment. \n\nThere's no pill to fix it and weekly therapy won't be enough. Alcholics have to develop daily systems to counter their addictions, they have to unlearn many habits, they have to isolate themselves from social situations that include alcohol, they have SO MUCH work to do, not unlike someone who has an autoimmune disorder and has to change everything about the way they live and monitor their lives in order to survive. \n\nAlcoholism isn't the kind of illness you overlook when dating.

It's a terrible terrible disease that can only be treated once the person who has it decides they have a problem (which isn't a decision that many alcoholics come to easily). \n\nOnce they decide they need treatment, they require a ton of medical care, therapy, and social support (often in the form of step groups or group therapy). Even when they are sober, if they are not in therapy, they are often very difficult people to have relationships with because the root of alcoholism is a mental illness characterized by exaggerated selfishness and stubbornness, and is often accompanied by a worldview of perpetual victimhood and self pity (which is what leads to self medication through drinking). \n\nAlcoholics can be some of the most mindbendingly toxic and abusive people you'll ever meet -- loving and warm one minute, cruel and twisted the next. Deciet, a lack of self control, gaslighting, stonewalling, verbal and emotional abuse, manipulation, nonsensical arguments, unreliability, financial instability, and impulsiveness are just some of the most common things you may deal with when in a relationship with an alcoholic. \n\nDrunk driving where someone gets killed or injured, physical abuse, sexual assault, theft, fraud, property damage, major organ failure, and suicide are the end result for alcoholics who don't receive and continue treatment. \n\nThere's no pill to fix it and weekly therapy won't be enough. Alcholics have to develop daily systems to counter their addictions, they have to unlearn many habits, they have to isolate themselves from social situations that include alcohol, they have SO MUCH work to do, not unlike someone who has an autoimmune disorder and has to change everything about the way they live and monitor their lives in order to survive. \n\nAlcoholism isn't the kind of illness you overlook when dating.

You say you receive little aid for college because your parents make too much money. I'm guessing you are in the US, because health insurance in most other civilized places is automatic and through the state. Go to the school counseling service, whatever it is, explain this, then hand them a print out of this post to read. It is possible to have yourself declared \"independent\" for FAFSA purposes on the grounds that having to contact your parents for any reason, including getting tax info, is detrimental to your health. You have documentation that these people abused you so badly that you had a stress-induced psychotic break. Trust me, you qualify."], [7, "Good grief yes this relationship is abusive.  Since you're financially independent I suggest cutting ties.  Drain the joint account in one fell swoop - close it if they let you, if not leave whatever sum in there that won't result in fees or penalties - and open your own account.\n\nStep two:  make very clear to dad that if she wants to speak to you, it's on your terms now.  Which means you pick the therapist and place.  Let the rest of your family know that you love them and if they want to continue to have a relationship with you, you'd like that.  She can't stop your family from seeing you if they want.\n\nYou're 20 years old and a legal adult. She has zero control over you unless you let yourself be manipulated by her.   It sounds as if you have a good head on your shoulders.  You don't need a manipulative, controlling narcissist in your life.  In the long term you'll be happier without her. "], [4, "Hi OP, I'm also trans. This is what I would recommend you do (a lot of it is stuff other posters have said).\n\nOne, get a new account at a different bank, and get all of your money into that account ASAP. Get your direct deposit switched over too if your employers do that. Sometimes direct deposit takes a couple cycles to switch over, so plan accordingly. Close out the account with your stepmom on it, if you can. If nothing else, get yourself taken off the account. Change your passwords to everything from a different device that your parents don't have access to, like a school computer or something.\n\nTwo, if you're in the US, look into your state's Medicaid. It's income-based only and being on your parent's insurance shouldn't disqualify you. Medicaid in my state covers my hormones as well. Not sure on surgeries, and it's still tricky to find good docs who take Medicaid, but it's definitely worth exploring.\n\nThree, do what you need to do in order to protect yourself. This might mean going super-low-contact with your dad for awhile, because he may well snitch to your stepmom. YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE SHIT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE TRANS.\n\nFour, you have to realize that you cannot control her actions. You cannot make her stop being shitty and abusive. Neither can you make your dad stop enabling her. You can only control how you move forward, and the only way to do that is to set boundaries and stick to them. Change your phone number if you have to. (Speaking of phones, if you haven't already, get your own plan. Virgin Mobile's is $35 for the cheapest one and I still get some reception out in the sticks. My phone itself was $100.)\n\nHonestly, I and ~~most~~ all of my trans friends have had to go through this process in some form or another.

He has no idea where I am right now.\n\nYou can take this a couple ways. What I did was to say \"you know what, you burned me too many times, I will never be able to trust you again, I'm done.\" In other words, I shut the door on reconciliation with my family. What a friend of mine did was \"if you decide to stop being shitty, then we can have a relationship, but if not, then bye.\" They've left the door open on reconciliation and it's up to their family to get it together.\n\nDepending on where you are, there may be an LGBT couchsurfing group of some sort near you on facebook or somesuch. I think there's also at least one site dedicated to couchsurfing.\n\nYou may also want to look into getting an order of no-contact against your stepmom.

I'm guessing you are in the US, because health insurance in most other civilized places is automatic and through the state. Go to the school counseling service, whatever it is, explain this, then hand them a print out of this post to read. It is possible to have yourself declared \"independent\" for FAFSA purposes on the grounds that having to contact your parents for any reason, including getting tax info, is detrimental to your health.

Which means you pick the therapist and place.  Let the rest of your family know that you love them and if they want to continue to have a relationship with you, you'd like that.  She can't stop your family from seeing you if they want.\n\nYou're 20 years old and a legal adult. She has zero control over you unless you let yourself be manipulated by her.   It sounds as if you have a good head on your shoulders.  You don't need a manipulative, controlling narcissist in your life.  In the long term you'll be happier without her. ", "id": "daqr1ll"}], [{"comment": "Hi OP, I'm also trans. This is what I would recommend you do (a lot of it is stuff other posters have said).\n\nOne, get a new account at a different bank, and get all of your money into that account ASAP. Get your direct deposit switched over too if your employers do that. Sometimes direct deposit takes a couple cycles to switch over, so plan accordingly. Close out the account with your stepmom on it, if you can. If nothing else, get yourself taken off the account. Change your passwords to everything from a different device that your parents don't have access to, like a school computer or something.\n\nTwo, if you're in the US, look into your state's Medicaid. It's income-based only and being on your parent's insurance shouldn't disqualify you. Medicaid in my state covers my hormones as well. Not sure on surgeries, and it's still tricky to find good docs who take Medicaid, but it's definitely worth exploring.\n\nThree, do what you need to do in order to protect yourself. This might mean going super-low-contact with your dad for awhile, because he may well snitch to your stepmom. YOU DO NOT DESERVE TO BE TREATED LIKE SHIT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE TRANS.\n\nFour, you have to realize that you cannot control her actions. You cannot make her stop being shitty and abusive. Neither can you make your dad stop enabling her. You can only control how you move forward, and the only way to do that is to set boundaries and stick to them. Change your phone number if you have to. (Speaking of phones, if you haven't already, get your own plan. Virgin Mobile's is $35 for the cheapest one and I still get some reception out in the sticks. My phone itself was $100.)\n\nHonestly, I and ~~most~~ all of my trans friends have had to go through this process in some form or another.

He has no idea where I am right now.\n\nYou can take this a couple ways. What I did was to say \"you know what, you burned me too many times, I will never be able to trust you again, I'm done.\" In other words, I shut the door on reconciliation with my family. What a friend of mine did was \"if you decide to stop being shitty, then we can have a relationship, but if not, then bye.\" They've left the door open on reconciliation and it's up to their family to get it together.\n\nDepending on where you are, there may be an LGBT couchsurfing group of some sort near you on facebook or somesuch. I think there's also at least one site dedicated to couchsurfing.\n\nYou may also want to look into getting an order of no-contact against your stepmom.

Those are the big tasks out the way. \n\nTidying. Drives me nuts. I like things in their place, my SO and our teenager...not so much. Wet towels dumped in corners, clothes on the floor, shoes discarded wherever, paperwork on tables, dirty plates on sides, no beds made, WHY GOD WHY. Every morning I get up and tidy the Teenagers room. Takes me 5 minutes if I do it each morning, or 5 hours if I leave it a week or two. Best to keep on top of that shit. Literally every single morning is the same routine- get up, switch off lights she's left on, tidy her room, pick up in the bathroom, clean the kitchen after she's obliterated it 'making breakfast,' and then make my bed. \n\nThe key to this is: pick your battles. Which hill are you going to die on? Is tidying for 15 minutes each morning worth it to stop your sanity from crumbling? I decided for me personally, it was worth it- I'd rather 15 minutes than hours of bitter arguments. I contain the mess from the start, like isolating water on a sinking ship. I wash up every single time something is used so there is never any build up. I literally wash up as I cook, I never walk away from the sink if there's so much as a spoon in there. I long ago accepted that no one else is going to do it, so I'd rather wash it up now than face a pile which takes an hour later on. If there's something on the coffee table I will deal with it immediately. If there's something on the floor I pick it up and put it away. Stray paperwork goes straight in the bin...if they can't be bothered to file it, it's obviously not that important. Believe me, they soon learnt that lesson. \n\nIt's about compromising. I've accepted that my standard of living is different and more anal than my savages, I MEAN FAMILY, so it's my responsibility to keep it to that standard. I can't expect them to be anal any more than they can expect me to be not-anal. Different horses for different courses. \n\nAlso....I've taken to throwing crap into a pile in the utility cupboard. If they haven't noticed it's missing in 3 months, it goes to the bin. You wouldn't believe how much I get rid of that they never mention again. Obviously nothing that I know is sentimental or super important (unless it's paperwork which goes straight in the bin, sorry not sorry, learn how to file you savages), but anything else...well, it's free game. Sometimes they'll ask for something and I'll fish it out, but that's incredibly rare. 9.5/10 it's never mentioned or noticed. \n\nHope you can find a happy compromise OP! \n\nETA: It took me literally years to get to this point. Cleaning strikes (ending up with a house that was verging on being condemned as a biohazard), walking out and staying at a hotel, screaming fights, it was a war zone. One day it just clicked; I love my family more than I hate the mess. Have I built a rod for my own back? Maybe...but I would rather enjoy my family and live harmoniously than battle with them over chores every second of the day.

Those are the big tasks out the way. \n\nTidying. Drives me nuts. I like things in their place, my SO and our teenager...not so much. Wet towels dumped in corners, clothes on the floor, shoes discarded wherever, paperwork on tables, dirty plates on sides, no beds made, WHY GOD WHY. Every morning I get up and tidy the Teenagers room. Takes me 5 minutes if I do it each morning, or 5 hours if I leave it a week or two. Best to keep on top of that shit. Literally every single morning is the same routine- get up, switch off lights she's left on, tidy her room, pick up in the bathroom, clean the kitchen after she's obliterated it 'making breakfast,' and then make my bed. \n\nThe key to this is: pick your battles. Which hill are you going to die on? Is tidying for 15 minutes each morning worth it to stop your sanity from crumbling? I decided for me personally, it was worth it- I'd rather 15 minutes than hours of bitter arguments. I contain the mess from the start, like isolating water on a sinking ship. I wash up every single time something is used so there is never any build up. I literally wash up as I cook, I never walk away from the sink if there's so much as a spoon in there. I long ago accepted that no one else is going to do it, so I'd rather wash it up now than face a pile which takes an hour later on. If there's something on the coffee table I will deal with it immediately. If there's something on the floor I pick it up and put it away. Stray paperwork goes straight in the bin...if they can't be bothered to file it, it's obviously not that important. Believe me, they soon learnt that lesson. \n\nIt's about compromising. I've accepted that my standard of living is different and more anal than my savages, I MEAN FAMILY, so it's my responsibility to keep it to that standard. I can't expect them to be anal any more than they can expect me to be not-anal. Different horses for different courses. \n\nAlso....I've taken to throwing crap into a pile in the utility cupboard. If they haven't noticed it's missing in 3 months, it goes to the bin. You wouldn't believe how much I get rid of that they never mention again. Obviously nothing that I know is sentimental or super important (unless it's paperwork which goes straight in the bin, sorry not sorry, learn how to file you savages), but anything else...well, it's free game. Sometimes they'll ask for something and I'll fish it out, but that's incredibly rare. 9.5/10 it's never mentioned or noticed. \n\nHope you can find a happy compromise OP! \n\nETA: It took me literally years to get to this point. Cleaning strikes (ending up with a house that was verging on being condemned as a biohazard), walking out and staying at a hotel, screaming fights, it was a war zone. One day it just clicked; I love my family more than I hate the mess. Have I built a rod for my own back? Maybe...but I would rather enjoy my family and live harmoniously than battle with them over chores every second of the day. Life is too short for that kind of resentment; they are such wonderful people in so many ways that focusing on mess was distracting from the love we share as a unit.", "id": "dar8sa2"}]]], "5ge9gq": ["Need help with SO", "2016-12-04 09:44:41", 1, "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ge9gq/need_help_with_so/", [[2, "The first relationship is always the hardest to end, for one.

Let me say i really can't stand these stupid hollywood cliches. There is not \"one person only for us\". If it was, then it would have been his first wife. Sometime, there is one person for a few years, and then another one for the next few years.

First, there's no reason he couldn't have her if he *really* wanted to and she reciprocates. He might cheat with her or if she leaves her husband, he could leave you to be with her. Also, he could fall in love with someone new and leave you in a few years, who knows... \n\nMy point is that you shouldn't feel safe that he's not going anywhere just because he can't have her since she's currently married and there isn't anyone else right now. It's much easier to leave a second marriage/partnership than the first one after you've done it before, especially when you don't have kids together and got together later in life.

Tell her how much your friend has been talking about her and how you feel like you already know so much about her. I would suggest maybe asking her out for a girls night to a restaurant.  Don't use any inside jokes around her and don't get handsy with your friend. Include her into every interaction you have with his family if she is around. After awile she should see you as just as Mich of a friend as you are to her boyfriend. "], [366, "It's really sweet of you to think of this! We see so much conflict on this sub between girlfriends/wives and their SO's female friends, so I'm glad you're trying to make sure you don't inadvertently set that off at all. Based on the threads we see from the girlfriend's perspective, here's what I'd recommend:\n\n-Give her as much attention as you do him. I'm sure you want to catch up with him, but make sure to spend some time getting to know her, and speaking to them as a couple. When congratulating her or talking about their relationship, keep it focused on *her* and *them* (\"I'm so glad John found someone who makes him so happy\"/\"I've been looking forward to meeting you, John's been telling everyone how funny/smart/awesome you are\") rather than on *him* (\"John's such a catch/you're a lucky girl!\").\n\n-As others have said, keep \"good old days\" talk and inside jokes to an absolute minimum. On the same track, try to tone down the \"part of the family\" vibes. This is *her* chance to become part of the family--and, hopefully, she'll become more of a part of the family than you are.\n\n-If they do speak Spanish with each other in public, I'd make sure she knows early on that you understand it, so she doesn't find out later and feel like you've been eavesdropping. \n\n-Be careful about friendly behavior that could be read as flirting. You mentioned how you \"kick his ass\" at video games--don't talk like that in front of her. Be careful about playful teasing like that--it can really easily sound flirtatious, even if it's innocent.\n\n-Be sure to pay attention to and interact with your husband at group gatherings. She's much less likely to be suspicious of you if she meets you and your husband as a unit; you'll be \"her fiance's couple friends\" and not \"her fiance's close female friend, oh and her husband, too.\"\n\n-I understand wanting to come across as supportive, but I wouldn't bring up politics unless she does. Especially if your intention is to show that you're a \"friend to minorities\"; while well-intentioned, it's really easy for that to come off poorly."], [121, "I only have advice for the language portion of it. When you meet her, talking about how you know a little Spanish and would love it if she'd be willing to practice with you sometime so you can improve. It's a good way to let her know that you could understand what she or your friend are saying, without it feeling like an intentional disclosure (so it doesn't feel like you're warning her that you'll understand it). Plus, it opens the two of you up to a bonding activity, which is always nice. "], [55, "You're overthinking some of this, though your intentions are clearly good! My main advice would be to take it slow, and play it by ear. For example: start out as friendly-and-polite on initial meetings, and then be your rowdier self in more casual circumstances, but tone it back down again if she seems uncomfortable. Be explicitly welcoming, but maybe don't bring up heavy political issues unless the conversation trends that way, and watch for signs of discomfort. Note at some point early on that you don't speak Spanish as well as you understand it, but would like to get better.\n\nThere are lots of little ways to make someone comfortable, but it's not a detailed list of those that'll help you: it'll be paying attention to seeing if she seems uncomfortable, being generally friendly and polite, and keeping lines of communication open. Make sure your friend knows that you'd like to know if you're overstepping some boundaries, so that he can discreetly communicate issues to you if any come up and his fiance isn't comfortable talking to you directly yet.\n\nBut overall? Relax. Deep breaths. Keep up the bit where you don't spend private time with your friend, given her issues. Make some allowances for her being young and nervous about coming into a more established social circle. It'll probably be fine."], [31, "I went through this a few years ago, not with a best friend of mine, but an old friend. He and I had both moved to a new country and reconnected due to that. Now his girlfriend and I are super close friends (I was one of her bridesmaids at their wedding) and he and my boyfriend get along very well also!\n\nThe way I handled it was when I first saw them (we met up at a pub) I gave my friend a hug, and then his girlfriend a hug and made a point of telling her how glad I was to finally get to meet her. We stuck to topics that related to everyone (the move, how we were getting on in the new country, things we found difficult etc) and I purposely focused most of my attention on my friend's girlfriend. The conversation naturally broke off into groups, where I ended up chatting quite a bit with the girlfriend and at the end of the evening I extended an invitation for them to come over another day to visit again - to the girlfriend. I made a point of telling her how much I enjoyed getting to know her, and how I was really looking forward to seeing them again.\n\nSo long story short: focus most of your attention on the girlfriend. I agree with others - no inside jokes, at least not on the first meeting. Once you get to know each other she'll be more comfortable joining in on those moments (for instance an inside joke between my friend and I was that he \"owns\" my left boob and I his right knee. One day he made a comment about this in front of wife BUT after she and I had established ourselves as friends. She responded that if that was the case she claimed my right boob. If that conversation had happened earlier it would have been really awkward for everyone but because we were friends it was an inside joke that she's now become a part of.)\n\nDon't worry to much about it, just keep your focus on her and making sure she feels included!"], [19, "Lets be honest you care more about her being ok with your friendship than her liking you. So you want the first meeting to not seem a threat to them.\n\nI would say have your friend and husband to run off to do whatever they enjoy and leave you 2 together to bond. That would make it feel more like he is a family friend and less like your friend."], [52, "The thing is, that you're not his best friend anymore. You don't get the bigger share of his time, of the connection, of his secrets. It's her now.\n\nSo my biggest tip is not to refer to yourself as his best friend.

"], [3, "I don't have much advice as to how to put her at ease and all that, but I did want to warn you about something. You said you don't know whether she knows about your sexual past with her fiance.....be VERY careful there. If she doesn't know about that then she could get very upset both at you and her fiance for keeping her in the dark this long, particularly if she startd to see you as a friend as well.

That will probably go a long way. Also, you shd divulge that you speak some Spanish; you don't want to come off as deceptive.

Being that she was really immature it turns out that she could not handle us being friends. He told me one day that she said to him \"I'm intimidated by her\" those words exactly. She couldn't handle the fact that I'd known him for so long. She is Hispanic with very old school way of thinking. Long story short...\nThey dated for a few weeks before she got pregnant, I offered all my old baby stuff to them.

Haha. \n\nSo, hey- you wanna be a role model. That's awesome. Actually, at a younger age, I met the ex-FWB of my boyfriend... He was trying to play us both off each other because he was insecure, so I had to seek her out on my own. \n\nHer face went gray with fear, and I kept my cool-- but only because I had four pages of possible ways to say \"I want to understand you better because I think I'm not getting the full context of the situation\" that maybe didn't sound so nerdy!!\n\nTurns out she and I had a lot of miscommunication to bridge, but she's still one of my favorite people, years later. (That BF and I though? Ugh, no mas, thank goodness.) \n\nMaybe that context was the key to that. You need to become a more complex picture than just \"the female friend my BF used to get off with.\" Luckily, you are, of course!\n\nSo the first time you meet* her should be a big family event- where you bring your husband and kids, so she gets the full context about what kind of person you are. *Welcome to our family, too, Fiancee!*\n\nThe key is to present it all truthfully, without excluding her. A common mistake is being so eager to present this picture that you forget that, in a thirteen-year friendship, a lot of that excludes her. That tends to come off as \"I know So much of him and you dont, neener neener.\" So try to remember that she sees a different side to him, and she might want to share that, too.\n\nAnd the minority thing... As a white lady myself, I'm not too qualified to tell you what's going to help her feel better. But I am used to The Language Reveal, since I speak 3 and really wouldn't want to make someone uncomfortable in that \"how long have you been standing there?\" kind of way. Maybe if she says something in Spanish, you can mention something like, \"Friendo told me you speak Spanish... It sounds beautiful. I was so excited to hear that because I learned a bit, too!\" Then follow up with a question about her life- or, in my case, I'm an language education wonk, so I'd probably go off on a tether about the benefit of bilingual schooling and she would be so bored with me she wouldn't be jealous but mystified as to why anyone would spend time with me, haha. I'm sure that you can think of something more interesting. \n\nThen, maybe if you click, spend some time getting to know each other, just you two. If it's not a natural step though, don't push it- that comes off as suspicious. In that case, hey, maybe trust takes time, but if your friendship with her fiance lasted this long, don't get impatient-- it's going nowhere.

I'm half hispanic, and was raised within a heavily hispanic community, and this young lady just sounds a lot like myself and many of the women I grew up around. \n\n>*She's from a Central American country and by the tone of her Facebook messages, I can tell she's a little bit frightened and angry (understandably) about how certain people in our country are treating our Latino neighbors. I live in a redneck state where everybody flies Confederate flags even though we were never part of the South, but I want to show her I can be a good advocate for minorities.\n\nWear a safety pin! Be warm and welcoming. Hispanic families are incredibly warm and friendly, we treat friends like family and family's SO's are also counted as family. Dont be afraid to give her a hug when you meet her (guaranteed shes used to it!) and when she leaves. If somebody says something that could be perceived as offensive, speak up. If she seems uncomfortable, invite her for a moment of girl time. Dont just show yourself as an advocate, but as a friend and a safe person. \n\n>*She speaks Spanish and my friend has learned her language. I understand Spanish really well from working in kitchens my whole life, and I can speak it a little. Do I need to disclose this info? I kind of thought it would be cool to figure out how she was feeling about me and shift my behavior accordingly, but I don't want to be sneaky.\n\nThis... this is where it gets tricky. Language is fascinating to me and i could discuss it forever. Im gonna say wait for the right time. I have too many examples to share but the point is that unless it is part of discussion, you are asked, or spoken of rudely in another language, it is unnecessary to put that information out there.\n\nBottom line advice: be yourself, but leave some extra space to show respect for your friend's relationship. Treat her just as warmly as you do your friend. Go into it like youre gonna get a new sister. Really, this guy is your bro, his fiance is gonna be your girl. Arrange a double date. Invite them to your home. Be genuine and get to know her. Find something to bond over. Give them (her) a gift! It can be as simple as a bottle of wine (or a case of beer, depending on your style i guess) or a homemade treat. Dont sweat all of this too much, once she gets to know you im sure she will love you.

I'm sure you want to catch up with him, but make sure to spend some time getting to know her, and speaking to them as a couple. When congratulating her or talking about their relationship, keep it focused on *her* and *them* (\"I'm so glad John found someone who makes him so happy\"/\"I've been looking forward to meeting you, John's been telling everyone how funny/smart/awesome you are\") rather than on *him* (\"John's such a catch/you're a lucky girl!\").\n\n-As others have said, keep \"good old days\" talk and inside jokes to an absolute minimum. On the same track, try to tone down the \"part of the family\" vibes. This is *her* chance to become part of the family--and, hopefully, she'll become more of a part of the family than you are.\n\n-If they do speak Spanish with each other in public, I'd make sure she knows early on that you understand it, so she doesn't find out later and feel like you've been eavesdropping. \n\n-Be careful about friendly behavior that could be read as flirting. You mentioned how you \"kick his ass\" at video games--don't talk like that in front of her. Be careful about playful teasing like that--it can really easily sound flirtatious, even if it's innocent.\n\n-Be sure to pay attention to and interact with your husband at group gatherings. She's much less likely to be suspicious of you if she meets you and your husband as a unit; you'll be \"her fiance's couple friends\" and not \"her fiance's close female friend, oh and her husband, too.\"\n\n-I understand wanting to come across as supportive, but I wouldn't bring up politics unless she does.

He was trying to play us both off each other because he was insecure, so I had to seek her out on my own. \n\nHer face went gray with fear, and I kept my cool-- but only because I had four pages of possible ways to say \"I want to understand you better because I think I'm not getting the full context of the situation\" that maybe didn't sound so nerdy!!\n\nTurns out she and I had a lot of miscommunication to bridge, but she's still one of my favorite people, years later.

I'm not sure if this was because of me or not.

I'm half hispanic, and was raised within a heavily hispanic community, and this young lady just sounds a lot like myself and many of the women I grew up around. \n\n>*She's from a Central American country and by the tone of her Facebook messages, I can tell she's a little bit frightened and angry (understandably) about how certain people in our country are treating our Latino neighbors. I live in a redneck state where everybody flies Confederate flags even though we were never part of the South, but I want to show her I can be a good advocate for minorities.\n\nWear a safety pin! Be warm and welcoming. Hispanic families are incredibly warm and friendly, we treat friends like family and family's SO's are also counted as family. Dont be afraid to give her a hug when you meet her (guaranteed shes used to it!) and when she leaves. If somebody says something that could be perceived as offensive, speak up. If she seems uncomfortable, invite her for a moment of girl time. Dont just show yourself as an advocate, but as a friend and a safe person. \n\n>*She speaks Spanish and my friend has learned her language.

I kind of thought it would be cool to figure out how she was feeling about me and shift my behavior accordingly, but I don't want to be sneaky.\n\nThis... this is where it gets tricky. Language is fascinating to me and i could discuss it forever. Im gonna say wait for the right time. I have too many examples to share but the point is that unless it is part of discussion, you are asked, or spoken of rudely in another language, it is unnecessary to put that information out there.\n\nBottom line advice: be yourself, but leave some extra space to show respect for your friend's relationship. Treat her just as warmly as you do your friend. Go into it like youre gonna get a new sister. Really, this guy is your bro, his fiance is gonna be your girl. Arrange a double date. Invite them to your home. Be genuine and get to know her. Find something to bond over. Give them (her) a gift! It can be as simple as a bottle of wine (or a case of beer, depending on your style i guess) or a homemade treat. Dont sweat all of this too much, once she gets to know you im sure she will love you.

If he had really been trying to apologize, he would have understood the severity of his actions and not pushed you into making an apology. An apology is supposed to be for **your** comfort, not to ease his guilty conscience. \n\nIt's up to you whether you believe that guy or not.

Maybe you can test the waters a bit - next time you two are hanging out together, bring up your brother and his steroids and see if he asks to hook him up and then casually mention that you don't do that. See if he tries to push you into doing it or gets mad when you refuse. \n\nIf you don't want to do that and you have a gut feeling they were right, you should trust that and start ghosting Brad.

While I appreciated the sentiment, I felt terrible that people working underneath me were essentially forced to buy presents *that I couldn't have afforded* for me, when I knew that they were making considerably less than I was. Some of the gifts were pretty extravagant, and one of the employees felt the need to apologize as I was opening her gift because she \"couldn't spend much\". (It was a $15 gift card to a favorite restaurant... I was thrilled to receive it, and touched that she'd been paying attention when I'd mentioned liking the place. I hate that she was made to feel uncomfortable about the gift.) \n\nFor the boss' birthday, I had to buy a pricey (for me) ticket to the event we were taking him to and help comp the cost of his ticket. I assumed that was the gift... but when I showed up to the party, everybody else had brought *additional* gifts! (Apparently, this was protocol.) I was the only one that didn't have a present for him, and it was super awkward.\n\nGifts aside, said office ended up being a poorly managed cesspit of dysfunction, and I did not last long.\n\nCount me in on the \"gifts shouldn't flow upward\" bandwagon... and on considering baking if you're not able to extricate yourself from the gift exchange.

That it goes against your principals to be so wasteful.\n\nBut for you, I recommend something similar to FuddyMoosh. Because you've already told people you can't afford to participate, I would double down with something to the affect that you have a limited holiday budget and that you choose to donate that money to your preferred charities rather than exchange gifts. And if they continue to pressure you, you can say something to the affect that...wow, you'd rather I buy you another coffee mug than help provide medical care to the children of Aleppo. Okay. Wow. Then just walk away.\n\nFinally, if you're having trouble buying food, it's okay to go to a food bank even if you're not eligible for food stamps. Maybe especially if you're not eligible. That's what they're there for. I've been giving monthly to Feeding America for years now because I'm incredibly fortunate and people such as yourself should absolutely be able to pay your bills and be able to eat. So think about going. And it 10 years when you're going well financially, think about giving back then. Pay it forward (although I'm not a fan of the movie I do think those of us who are fortunate should try to share rather than try to obtain more stuff).\n\nTry to have a happy holiday and good luck on finding the job that makes you happy.", "id": "dar2vpb"}], [{"comment": "Do not JADE.

He may also be considering the fact that talking to you about it will revive your insecurities and will hurt you, and that's probably the last thing he wants to do, or deal with.\n\nGrief is a funny thing in that it can be all encompassing.

You're here to listen.\n\nAnd that if he doesn't want that, if he doesn't want to talk to you, that's OK, but he needs to speak with someone.

People are being super harsh with you because they're misreading your post, I think. Sorry about that.\n\nWhat I'm getting here is not so much that you're being ignored, but that you're being shut out. I can tell from your responses that you think your insecurities are the *cause* of that shutout (whereas most people seem to think that you're explaining them as a *reason* for why he needs to open up to you/stop grieving).\n\nThing is, I think you're right but not in the way you're expecting.\n\nSo, grief does terrible things to people. He may be a private griever, he may also (as other posters mentioned) be suffering from shock (that could have been me, etc). He may also be considering the fact that talking to you about it will revive your insecurities and will hurt you, and that's probably the last thing he wants to do, or deal with.\n\nGrief is a funny thing in that it can be all encompassing. He may have shut you out of his grief, for the reasons explained above, but because it's so present in his life right now, and because he's holding it in, he's shut you out of everything, and you have an emotionally checked out partner.\n\nThere's not much to do except sit down and talk with him. Explain to him that you understand if he would prefer to keep his grief private. However, you are his partner and it is your job to help him if he is in pain. Tell him that your insecurities don't matter; if he's holding back because of them, he really shouldn't. They are your cross to bear, not his, and no matter what, you're there for him and that this isn't about you, it's about his ex-wife and him and his loss. You're here to listen.\n\nAnd that if he doesn't want that, if he doesn't want to talk to you, that's OK, but he needs to speak with someone. Tell him that he's been checked out emotionally for a month and that his disengagement and distance is unhealthy, and that you're worried about him. Ask him if he's willing to do a couple of sessions with a grief therapist, to untangle the grief \"knot\", to process the loss.\n\nDO NOT tell him he needs to heal, or feel better. Pain demands to be felt, and can seem like the only tribute we can give to the dead we have loved. Simply, there are several ways to grieve, but they can be healthy, or unhealthy, and it seems like he's going with option 2.\n\nGood luck.

People grieve differently, and for him it might be just shutting out the world and feeling too numb to really even process or properly react to what's \"outside\" his grief bubble. I think that's why you're getting flak from some commenters here, because to them it does sound like you're saying he should stop grieving due to this. I know you're not, but if isolating is your boyfriend's way of grieving, wanting him to connect with you essentially does come off as wanting him to be done with it already.\n\nHe could very likely be some version of this the entire time he grieves, and as frustrating and helpless as it must feel to watch, there just isn't a magic way to make him open up to you in order to grieve. \n\nAt best, all you can do is make sure he's aware that grief counseling could help him process some of this, and do some of the leg work in identifying potential resources, but you CANNOT pressure him or force him to do it. All you can do is be there for him, be his rock. If that's too difficult for you after a certain amount of time, which is understandable, you need to think about at that point perhaps separating, at least temporarily.\n\nI'll also gently ask this--you said in another comment your boyfriend divorced with her because she didn't want children and he did. Had you and he discussed marriage yet ever, or a timeline to having children together, since that's clearly important to him? If you hadn't in over four years, then I'm sorry to say, he might have been in a different place than you in the relationship, and that could actually be where your continuous feelings of insecurity were coming from--because maybe you were picking up on that?
