How much did all the welding gear cost you?", "id": "daiyvyi"}, {"comment": "I took a stick welding class this summer at the local community college. It was good to learn the basics of welding (speed control, heat control, puddle control which are all really the same thing) and to be able to watch the instructor weld, and I got tons of practice time. I wanted to learn TIG though, so I bought a multiprocess stick/TIG welder (an Everlast 160STH) and watched a bunch of videos from weldingtipsandtricks on youtube.\n\nWelding gear cost? All in... I don't want to talk about it. The biggest single layout was for the machine itself at about $400. But that also comes with a decent stinger, work clamp, TIG torch, and regulator. \n\nNext most expensive would be the bottle of argon. I ended up purchasing an 80cf bottle for about $250 out the door. You can lease a bottle for less up-front costs, though. And obviously, with stick, there's no need for gas at all, just electrodes.\n\nNext would probably be PPE. I got a passive welding helmet with a nice gold lens for about $40.  You can get an auto-darkening helmet for that money, but some people have issues with flickering on those. Gloves are essential, especially for stick: $20-$40. Safety glasses are probably a good idea, especially for stick: $10. Face shield for grinding/cutting, I got a nicer one for about $20.\n\nThen there's consumables. For stick, it's pretty much just the electrodes. You'll also need wire brushes for cleaning slag. For TIG, you'll need tungsten ($20-$30 for a set of 10). Collets, cups, etc. (you can just buy a kit to start off and replace pieces as needed) $20-$40. A flap wheel for grinding mill scale off mild steel, and  hiding your shame.\n\nI happened to have an angle grinder already, but I also bought a bench grinder to use for sharpening tungsten (amongst other things). If you use a bench grinder, just make sure you dedicate a wheel to only Tungsten. If you're stick welding, you'll want a chipping hammer, $10-$20, and you'll want to keep it sharp.\n\nSo depending on the process you want to learn, and what you already have on hand, you could probably get up and running for between $500 and $1000.", "id": "daj14y0"}, {"comment": "Thank you!!

Nubuck is the top split which has been sanded to make it look and feel like suede.

That wall really needed something to anchor it, the fireplace on it's own looked just kind of...there.  This now gives it some attention and purpose.  \n\nI was going to suggest that you consider moving the couch and chairs around so [the couch was parallel to the fireplace with the chairs flanking.](http://thesweetestdigs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DSC_14771.jpg) This would open up the room to the kitchen and make it feel like a bigger space instead of having the couch be such a barrier.  But then I just read that you are putting in a piano, so that might not work?\n\nI'd also consider a bigger rug. [ Rugs define the perimeter of a room, so a smaller rug makes it feel like the room is smaller and a larger one opens it up.](https://blog.wmaproperty.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/rug-size-1-1024x340.png)  I will say that I tend to go with the \"good size\" from that example, but you can see how just changing the rug makes the same furniture distance look completely different. \n\nThe rug thing isn't pressing, but if you do ever decide to get a new one I would go bigger.  \n\nGreat job!

I love the finishes and all of the trim work, there are some really nice details in this space.  \n\nFirst: what feeling do want to when you are in this room?  Calm/relaxed/happy/energetic/creative/comfortable, etc.  Right now I would say your space is calm, happy, elegant.  \n\nI think Jute always works.  It's on the bland side, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It still defines the room, makes it feel a bit cozier, but is simple and clean.  \n\nA simple plain jute rug would definitely work, it would make it feel more casual.  If you want to keep the understated elegant feeling, consider a nature fiber rug with a slight pattern.  [This white pattern](http://rk.pbimgs.com/pbimgs/rk/images/dp/wcm/201641/0075/jute-lattice-rug-flax-ivory-c.jpg) would match the white trim, match the patterned patterns on the pillows, while still [still looking neutral and simple](http://rk.pbimgs.com/pbimgs/rk/images/dp/wcm/201638/0004/jute-lattice-rug-flax-ivory-c.jpg).  Or something with just a [subtle texture](http://garnethill.scene7.com/is/image/garnethill/40354_alt5?$zv_main$).  \n\nJute can go into \"beachy\" territory.  If that's not what you want, but you like the neutral, a [geometric pattern in neutrals](http://ab.weimgs.com/weimgs/ab/images/wcm/products/201641/0002/marquis-wool-rug-natural-o.jpg) will be a bit more modern, and bit more \"city\".\n\nDon't go neutral just because you are too scared to pick anything crazier.  Go with neutral because you want a calm and soothing room that is simple.  If you want more energy, more liveliness look at color and patterns.  That room can handle a patterned rug without it taking over.  \n\n[Bring in some of the yellows](http://ab.weimgs.com/weimgs/ab/images/wcm/products/201639/0090/blur-ikat-rug-citron-c.jpg) for cheeriness.

Don't be afraid of pattern, after you put the couches and the ottoman on top of the rug you don't see much of it so it won't be as in your face and you may think.  \n\nUltimately decide the feeling you want.  Then google image search grey living room tan couch, or camel couch, and look at which rooms you guys like the best. Then really look at what rug they have (neutral, colorful, etc) and you might be surprised but what you actually like when you see it in a full room.  Add in your adjective of choice (happy grey and tan living room, calm grey blue and yellow living room) and start looking at what draws your eye.

Use the 20% off coupon they constantly have and it's about the same price as the others.  I just made a slight modification on the water spout of the saw.  I used some lawn irrigation elbows and a splitter along with some plastic tubing for fridges to make it so it sprays water on each side of the blade instead of head-on like the original design has.  Works great.  I don't get wet at all, it's easy to see the cut marks, crosscuts are a breeze, it has less blade wobble than the other brands(almost none), etc.  Very pleased with it.", "id": "dacoa9s"}, {"comment": "Thanks, good input!", "id": "dacotcr"}, {"comment": "I rented a really nice wet saw for a tiling job, but the next time I tiled I just freehanded the cuts with my grinder with a 4\" diamond blade.

Then I prefer to use a cementitious leveling compound that is troweled on with a smooth edge trowel or drywall knife to fill low spots. To me, self-levelers only make sense on very large areas. The surface doesn't have to be slate flat and smooth. Absolutely nothing can telegraph through your stone. But one or two high spots can leave you with a crack. If you think of your stone as being brittle as a saltine you won't go wrong. As for stiffening up your framing and subfloor, it sounds like such a small area that overkill might not be uncalled for. Sistering in additional joists, adding cross bracing, and even replacing a small section of subfloor with thicker material would all help. A lot really depends on what is already there. Older homes may have diagonally laid tongue and groove or shiplap for subflooring. This stuff moves quite a lot. On the other hand, older homes often feature full dimensional oversized floor joists that are very resistant to deflection. Newer homes are often built to meet codes and seldom beyond. That can mean platform systems with relatively lightweight joists or trusses that permit a lot of movement but also featuring superior connections between components. If access to the underside is easy, then I'd recommend overkill. If access to the underside involves destroying finished spaces or (egad!) entering a confined crawlspace, I'd focus instead on what you can accomplish from above, with particular attention to the subfloor surface material.

There'll be maybe 3-6\" of cable in the finished notch depending on how thick your walls are. In this case, the easiest thing to do will be go and get a foot-long file or rasp from your local home improvement store and cut the notch with it. If that fails, place a strip of masking tape on either side of where you want the notch and then just dremel between the lines. If you want a deep notch, take a drill bit the width that you want the final notch, and wrap tape around it so that only the length of bit equal to the desired depth of notch is exposed. Then drill a series of holes as close together as you can along the notch, and dremel out the remaining wood. \n\n2) The cable is running from one side of the door to the other, within the same room. In this scenario, maybe 3' of cable is in the notch, depending on how wide the actual door is. The absolute easiest way to mount a cable this way is to go get some clear command hooks or just nail/tack the cable onto the top of the frame, as it'll be pretty much invisible because it's up so high. If you really want a notch, the easiest thing to do will be to just remove the entire top board of the decorative frame around the door, then sand away the wood where your cable will sit, then put it back.

Cut them short enough to where the don't interfere with the lip the slat's sit on. \n\nPredrill both pieces (it'll split the ply if you don't) while clamped and glued (doesn't have to be dry, you can do it immediately after running your glue bead. Don't be stingy with your bead. The wood around it will break before the glue gives) so you don't go off your mark while drilling. Use 1-1/4\" wood or drywall screws (coarse thread.) \n\nPick a drill bit size that when held over the screw is just barely larger than the shaft but still gives plenty for the thread to grab. Take off the clamps, the screws will hold them together fine. \n\nCut some ply to fit the cavity and lay it over the new slats. If you use more than one piece make sure the joints are on a slat and fasten them with 3/4\" fine thread wood or drywall screws. \n\nThe T's distribute the load and prevent flexing in the slat's and the ply will distribute the weight even further.

The other side still had the glossy finish and was not sticky. So we got the picture printed on a big sheet of paper like I said, and we laid it face down. Then we peeled of one side of the contact paper and pressed it (sticky side down) to the back of sheet. Once we had covered the entire pattern (feel free to cut the sheets in half, triangles, etc) we peeled off the other side of protective covering from the contact paper. Please note it's pretty important to not have extra space between sheets of contact paper, it'll mess up the stencil.

So the extra moisture from the air forms as droplets of water on the cold surface AKA condensation.\n\nSo if you manage to create a situation where warm air from the inside of the house cannot pass the plywood and hit the cold glass surface, no remarkable condensation should occur.   \nBasically if the outside temperature and the temperature between the glass and plywood is the same, no condensation should occur, except maybe on the inside surface of the plywood. Optimally you should drill the plywood on in a driest and coldest enviroment as possible to prevent initial build up of moisture between the glass and plywood\n\nOfcourse things are not always as simple as simple physics. But in the worst case you have the option to drill a hole in the plywood to let the condensated water flow inside the house."], [1, "You have to prevent warm, humid air from the inside from hitting the cold surface. That's basically what you need to do.\n\nWood will let water vapor through. So even if you achieve a tight seal of the board with the glas, which you absolutely must, it is possible that enough moisture gets through the wood itself to build up behind it. Simply because the glas is absolutely air tight, but the wood isn't. When it comes to insulating, the least permeable layers always need to be on the warm side and the most permeable layers have to be on the cold side.\n\nIn your situation, with the glas outside you break that rule. Because wood is far more permeable than glas. So you have to add a layer that is as unpermeable to water vapor as glas. Thats your solution.\n\nWhat I would do in your situation: Make sure the side of the wood that is touching the glas is completely sealed shut. Like glue, full area, some vapor retarder with an SD of 100 or so onto it. Then fix the wood to the glas so that absolutely no new air can come between the glas and the wood. Since the backside of the wood will be tight now, new moisture will not be able to get in between through the wood itself.\n\nOr I would get a piece of PUR insulation with aluminum layer on it. Maybe 10 or 20mm thick. Then I would glue that onto the window and the board onto the PUR insulation. The insulation of that will be mindblowing compared to a single pane glas...\n\nAlso, last but not least. If you don't need to be able to open the window I'd actually consider replacing the whole thing just with 6/6mm double pane glas. These are really not too expensive to buy. I just bought some for around 50E a square meter. You can get them from ebay and stuff...\n\nAlso, I just did a big write up on energy efficiency of houses and there is a lot of theory in it about insulation, which als might answer some questions. http://www.jumble.blue/en/how-to-build-or-renovate-a-house-that-produces-its-own-energy/"], [0, "If you board up the window the condensation has no where to go.

So the extra moisture from the air forms as droplets of water on the cold surface AKA condensation.\n\nSo if you manage to create a situation where warm air from the inside of the house cannot pass the plywood and hit the cold glass surface, no remarkable condensation should occur.   \nBasically if the outside temperature and the temperature between the glass and plywood is the same, no condensation should occur, except maybe on the inside surface of the plywood. Optimally you should drill the plywood on in a driest and coldest enviroment as possible to prevent initial build up of moisture between the glass and plywood\n\nOfcourse things are not always as simple as simple physics. But in the worst case you have the option to drill a hole in the plywood to let the condensated water flow inside the house.", "id": "danoet3"}], [{"comment": "You have to prevent warm, humid air from the inside from hitting the cold surface. That's basically what you need to do.\n\nWood will let water vapor through. So even if you achieve a tight seal of the board with the glas, which you absolutely must, it is possible that enough moisture gets through the wood itself to build up behind it. Simply because the glas is absolutely air tight, but the wood isn't. When it comes to insulating, the least permeable layers always need to be on the warm side and the most permeable layers have to be on the cold side.\n\nIn your situation, with the glas outside you break that rule. Because wood is far more permeable than glas. So you have to add a layer that is as unpermeable to water vapor as glas. Thats your solution.\n\nWhat I would do in your situation: Make sure the side of the wood that is touching the glas is completely sealed shut. Like glue, full area, some vapor retarder with an SD of 100 or so onto it. Then fix the wood to the glas so that absolutely no new air can come between the glas and the wood. Since the backside of the wood will be tight now, new moisture will not be able to get in between through the wood itself.\n\nOr I would get a piece of PUR insulation with aluminum layer on it. Maybe 10 or 20mm thick. Then I would glue that onto the window and the board onto the PUR insulation. The insulation of that will be mindblowing compared to a single pane glas...\n\nAlso, last but not least. If you don't need to be able to open the window I'd actually consider replacing the whole thing just with 6/6mm double pane glas. These are really not too expensive to buy. I just bought some for around 50E a square meter. You can get them from ebay and stuff...\n\nAlso, I just did a big write up on energy efficiency of houses and there is a lot of theory in it about insulation, which als might answer some questions. http://www.jumble.blue/en/how-to-build-or-renovate-a-house-that-produces-its-own-energy/", "id": "dao7ybd"}], [{"comment": "If you board up the window the condensation has no where to go.

If you want help with the temperature and can't put in a new double paned window, you can put in a plexiglass window in a channel so you can remove it for cleaning.

I've seen a few restoration projects for this same model. ", "id": "dajs752"}, {"comment": "Well for me it's a few reasons. They have a (well deserved) good reputation for being solid, reliable, good-cooking grills. \n\nCompared to how most new grills are made (flimsy thin stainless steel), the cast aluminum tub and lid sides mean much higher longevity, and it holds the heat better. \n\nThe weak point of these grills is the frame. You see lots of them with rusted out caster feet, and that's the only issue. Other than that, they are practically bulletproof. \n\nThe biggest draw, though, is repairability. They made the Genesis with roughly the same parts for over 10 years. Then they made the Spirit grills with most of the same grates, burners, and ignition system for another few years. I think the Spirit 3-burner grill still uses the same size grates and warming racks. And parts for these grills are still available, and inexpensive. \n\nThe grates for my Char-Broil would have been $70 to replace. They would have been the same trash that fell apart after 18 months. What's worse, each model of Kenmore/Char-Broil grill has slightly different cooking area dimensions, meaning you're stuck with the choice of one type of grate for your grill.\n\nI picked up a set of Weber grates for $40, but in the same size, I had the choice of channel-formed porcelain coated steel, channel-formed stainless, stainless steel rod, or porcelain coated cast iron. \n\nEach burner (there were four) of my Char-Broil was $20, and each one had an ignitor instead of a crossover system. Each electrode was $5, making the cost for replacing the burners and ignition $100. A set of three stainless steel burners and crossover tube from Weber is $45, and the ignitor is $10, making it roughly half.

", "id": "dae260a"}, {"comment": "\"...the carpet is coming out anyway...\"\n\nSo you (or the next guy) will have to decide between doing another job incorrectly by leaving the carpet under the cabinets and ending the floor where you should have ended the carpet, or pulling out your cabinets that are otherwise very nice and redoing the job correctly. \n\nYou also have cabinets resting on that carpet which is not the proper way to install the cabinets, and confirms that you didn't actually shim them square and level. Then you have no intention of ever replacing that carpet, but plan on living there a long time... Sounds like bad planning and I sure hope you don't have pets or young kids in there ever... and that mid-pile brown carpet never goes out of style (a little late on that already to be honest). If it were tile or hardwood you could maybe get away with this because new flooring can be laid on top and you could have shimmed on it, but not carpet.\n\nLastly, cutting that section of carpet out and doing it right would have added about 15 minutes of work to the job and the only cost would be a small piece of trim along the bottom and maybe a tack strip if you want to be thorough. Just accept that you screwed up and take note of it for next time. \n\nLike I said, not the end of the world.

The decor suggests you are in law enforcement. Since you mentioned you you have a 20 month old and a brand new baby, i have definitely have some questions. \n\n1.  How did you pitch this idea to your partner?  This is no small job- this is a lot of time, energy, trips to HD, loud noises, you being in out in the garage for long stretches of time, construction debris, (and possibly even a trip or 2 to the urgent care for accidents).  To really add to the difficulty level, it even sounds like this project is to specifically benefit you, rather than either of those babies (nursery stuff), or her (built-in closet).  Please share your secrets, i think we could all stand to learn something from you.\n\n2.  From what I understand, babies don't sleep much, which means you, in turn, don't sleep much. Since you didnt mention anyone helping, this was a lot of work for one sleep deprived person to accomplish. Was there a legal, \"supplement,\" you were taking during this project that gave you the energy and ability to concentrate to not cut your fingers off, and not fuck up the measurements and other details? Again, please share!\n\nFinally, i must say once again that your project looks great and you are lucky to have such a cool space for an office and i hope you enjoy it.  Congratulations on your newest baby! \n", "id": "dae23jz"}, {"comment": "Thanks!  The cabinets fit almost perfect and there are so many configurations out there pre-fab is easier, faster, cheaper, and just more convenient.  You are correct in your observations, I am in LE.\n\n1-My wife hates it when I start doing these projects.  But, I'm doing it for the betterment of the home.  Most times I just start doing it without telling her and then it's too late.  Better to ask forgiveness than permission right?  Plus, I did both nurseries the way she wanted.  My daughter got board and batten walls and my son just got a distressed plank wall so she still wins.  I have an airless nail gun (Ryobi) that I love.  No air tank running making noise all the time.  Adding those french doors helped bc I could shut them to help dampen the sound as well.  I work 12 hour shifts and am off 50% of the time.  I also work overnight.  So, when I'm off work I still stay up super late to keep my body on schedule.  She was pregnant during this job so we only had one baby to contend with, who is an absolute dream.  My angel.  I usually put her to bed around 10 and she sleeps until 10-11 in the morning.  How awesome is that?  Once the baby is down and the wife is either watching TV or has gone to bed and I have the rest of the night to myself to work. I normally try to make all my cuts at the same time so the saw is not running constantly.  I probably have a better chance of pissing off the neighbors than waking up the family.  Also, this project benefitted all of us as we all gained a ton of storage in the cabinets.  The office is generally her area.  I just like making the house looks nice.  So far, fingers crossed, I've never had an accident or gotten hurt doing these projects.  I repeat in my head \"fingers, fingers, fingers\" when making my cuts just to be sure.\n\n2-As mentioned, my daughter is a rockstar.  No supplements needed.  My body has gotten used to shift work from almost 20 years of doing this.  I've been in LE for almost 17 and prior to that I worked shift work in a hospital for several years so it's nothing new to me.  I actually prefer anything other than a standard \"day\" shift.  I used to drink Monster drinks at times but that was just because I liked them, not because I needed them.

If you have a milling machine, I feel like with the right fixture you could machine the exterior character surfaces and grooves much easier than drilling so many holes. This raises the question though, how to cut the interior grooves for customizing the code? Machining the outside of a tube is much easier than the inside, but why do you really need to machine the inside of the tube? My suggestion would be to reverse your scheme for indexing the character ring and keyway ring, so that your inner ring has a exterior groove for each letter, and the outer character ring has a single interior groove... \n\n\nThe goal with all of this is to allow you to machine many rings at once, limited only by the travel of your milling machine table. Using a ball end mill, you could replace your 720 holes with 66 (?) passes along the length of your tubes(outer character ring tube + inner keyway tube).

Use a slow setting epoxy (8-12 hr version works great) and overfill the void a little bit, so that once you overfill,  if there are any bubbles that you miss, they will rise to the overfill section and you won't have any voids on what will eventually be the surface of your table.

It was a two story unit and top and bottom units were connected.  Several times when I forced a clog down it just wound up clogging downstairs.

That particular urethane was beautiful because of its chemistry, which happened to have some cruel toxicity.\n\nHe did a beautiful job protecting his project.\n\nVinyl doesn't match the toxicity of uncured urethane, and we can safely use urethane.

Here's a link to a fairly technical but very informative article: https://buildingscience.com/documents/digests/bsd-106-understanding-vapor-barriers  Without knowing all the details, it is very unlikely that you would want *no* vapor retarder/barrier on the interior of your walls. But it is also unlikely that you would want a fully impermeable membrane like plastic sheeting. If the rest of your home features craft faced batts then restoring the craft faced membrane is probably best. Also please be advised that new retrofit windows are a *frequent* source of moisture problems in exterior wall framing. Aside from the enormous care needed in building an effective flashing system to protect the wall cavity, over extension of adhesive flashing membranes onto the exterior sheathing can trap moisture and prevent effective drying.

WDYT?", "id": "daqmqvy"}, {"comment": "You know, most of the criticism I've read about collar ties and the information on rafters doesn't apply to a pyramid roof. With a pyramid roof structure like you are showing in that first picture the extra support generally looks like that. I'll link to a few others. One thing to keep in mind is the lap decking you put up (with framing nails) is giving you some support between the rafters from the down and out tensions from the roof. You are a little more flat so I don't know if that works for or against you or doesn't matter. Obviously for a snow load it doesn't.\n\nhttp://www.contractortalk.com/attachments/f11/11138d1218565219-framing-modified-pyramid-roof-without-trusses-shed1.jpg\n\nhttp://hammerandhand.com/images/page-content/Field-notes/yamhill-vineyard-rafters-15.jpg\n\nhttp://www.contractortalk.com/attachments/f3/316618d1466441860-hip-roof-without-ceiling-joists-1466441858763.jpg\n\nhttp://www.theclassicarchives.com/images/articles/free-gazebo-plans-03.jpg \n\nOn a regular roof with no rafter ties a collar tie doesn't provide any beneficial support and may even create greater outward forces on walls. It provides support for a inadequate roof ridge.\n\n\n*Interestingly, this collapsed gazebo in Pelham is lacking a unified top plate and the modular design seems structurally inadequate, probably over-relying on fasteners. But you can see it pushed out (the sides of the structure) in the last photograph. It's a much larger roof than what you have though.\n\nhttp://www.pelhamplus.com/top_news/collection_9580ab9c-9e5f-11e3-9ed9-0017a43b2370.html\n\nhttp://www.pelhamplus.com/top_news/collection_db370b88-db98-11e3-9ad9-0017a43b2370.html\n\nhttp://www.pelhamplus.com/top_news/collection_9580ab9c-9e5f-11e3-9ed9-0017a43b2370.html\n\nhttp://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/pelhamplus.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/a2/8a2f0c52-9e5f-11e3-afad-0017a43b2370/530d03e4dca54.image.jpg?resize=760%2C506\n\n\nBut your easiest bet is a couple rafter ties a little bit above the top plate (otherwise you have to make a beam out of three pieces of wood to get it to sit exactly on the plate) . Use two ledgerlok screws to attach to the rafter. You can cut a piece of wood for the rafter tie to sit on that rests on the plate and either attach it permanently or remove after the ties are secure. You can put additional lighting on the ties as well, just resting on top.\n\nOr...if you have structure there under the deck in the middle put a somewhat temporary vertical support in the winter under the king post and remove in spring-fall. The only thing that might not work is the fasteners into your mini-kingpost would be put under some strain if the snow load was very demanding and the kingpost itself depending on how swiss-cheesed it is with the fasteners.\n\nAnd...one last thing. You could do metal tie rods in lieu of the traditional wooden rafter tie. They are a little expensive and you can over-tighten and cause problems but you'd be able to criss-cross you structure without splicing or cutting a beam and not overloading your ceiling visuals.\n\nhttp://www.portlandbolt.com/products/rods/tie-rods/\n\nhttps://st.hzcdn.com/fimgs/d501f8e1009d3bdf_1961-w500-h400-b0-p0--farmhouse-living-room.jpg\n\n", "id": "daquzf3"}, {"comment": "I really don't think any amount of snow cover is going to affect this beam.

Will probably bury 6\"-1' deep.* Not so good. Most code is (I believe) at least 6\" for RMC/IMC metal conduit and 24\" for flexible or PVC. RMC is definitely better and isn't going to rust as fast as IMC tends to. I'd go 12\" with either of the metal conduits even if you don't need to. You should be using UF/THHN (Underground Feeder), not Romex. The bends aren't a problem, but save yourself some headache and run the cables through the conduit before burying it. My personal opinion would be to run 3 cables and not two. Since this will be an office, if you decide to have things like a laser printer/computers/various other things, you might not want to run your lighting off the same circuit. My suggestion would be: 1 circuit for heater/ac, 1 circuit GFCI circuit for indoor lighting, outdoor lighting and an outdoor plug (because you never know when you might need an outdoor plug), 1 circuit for your interior plugs Edit: Just make sure you run 20a breakers. And keep in mind, most AC units have a start amperage higher than their rated amperage.\n* *Will be running coax and a cat 6 cable in the same size conduit as the electrical (but will be a separate conduit)* Sounds good. Leave a good pull rope in it in case you ever want to run a phone line. Here it is okay to skimp and go with PVC instead of rigid metal. You might want to look at bundled cable that has cat6+rg6 in one since it might save you a little money that buying each (or maybe not). Definitely go with quad-shielded RG6 and shielded cat6 since you'll only be a few inches away from electrical. Even in a metal pipe, the EMI can be detected feet away. (How else would those detectors work!)\n* *the shed is lifted about a foot off the ground (plenty of airflow) so I'm not sure if a vapor barrier is necessary.* Man -- that's a hard one. Unfortunately, there are constantly mixed opinions on this subject. My opinion is, since you're going to be heating/cooling it, treat it like a house. But, the R13 rolls you linked have a built in vapor barrier (\"facing\"). The problem is that you're in a mixed climate -- mixed-humid to hot-humid -- which is obvious by the fact that you need both heating and cooling, so mixed-humid is probably the best descriptor. In mixed environments, it's almost always better to avoid vapor barriers and go for the ability to dry which means unfaced insulation. You also want to keep the heaviest moisture out, which means a drainage plane that is vapor-permeable on the exterior. If you've got plywood sheathing underneath the siding on the shed, you're probably good (at least the plywood would rot before the framing does and you won't leak a bunch of water into your insulation). If not, a house wrap is a good option. In the end, it will be a long time before you know if you made the right decision.\n* *I plan on using plywood and staining/adding polyurethane coat* Should be fine, but you might want to consider a treated subfloor below your finished \"flooring\". Basically, 1/2\" treated plywood underneath your 1/2\" plywood. Lay the top plywood at right angles to the bottom plywood which will help with the movement. You might even consider an underlayment between the two layers.\n\nJust my thoughts, hope it helps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"], [1, "You might be in the narrow strip that has almost equal amounts of heating and cooling and doesn't need a vapor barrier. https://www.nachi.org/vapor-barriers.htm"], [1, "You're not supposed to bury romex.

In the end, it will be a long time before you know if you made the right decision.\n* *I plan on using plywood and staining/adding polyurethane coat* Should be fine, but you might want to consider a treated subfloor below your finished \"flooring\". Basically, 1/2\" treated plywood underneath your 1/2\" plywood. Lay the top plywood at right angles to the bottom plywood which will help with the movement. You might even consider an underlayment between the two layers.\n\nJust my thoughts, hope it helps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "danvv7j"}, {"comment": "> Most code is (I believe) at least 6\" for RMC/IMC metal conduit and 24\" for flexible or PVC. RMC is definitely better and isn't going to rust as fast as IMC tends to. I'd go 12\" with either of the metal conduits even if you don't need to. You should be using UF/THHN (Underground Feeder), not Romex. The bends aren't a problem, but save yourself some headache and run the cables through the conduit before burying it. My personal opinion would be to run 3 cables and not two. Since this will be an office, if you decide to have things like a laser printer/computers/various other things, you might not want to run your lighting off the same circuit. My suggestion would be: 1 circuit for heater/ac, 1 circuit GFCI circuit for indoor lighting, outdoor lighting and an outdoor plug (because you never know when you might need an outdoor plug), 1 circuit for your interior plugs Edit: Just make sure you run 20a breakers. And keep in mind, most AC units have a start amperage higher than their rated amperage.\n\nthanks a ton for these pointers. I'm going to try and dig deep enough to handle the PVC conduit because I want to avoid any rust issues with the metal conduit. I'm definitely going add an outdoor gvci outlet as well because you never know (I should have listed that in the OP). Because of that I may consider running a third circuit as well. If anything I'll leave a good pull rope in both of the conduits for anything in the future I might need. \n\n> Man -- that's a hard one. Unfortunately, there are constantly mixed opinions on this subject. My opinion is, since you're going to be heating/cooling it, treat it like a house. But, the R13 rolls you linked have a built in vapor barrier (\"facing\")\n\nI agree it's a hard decision and I haven't found anything 100% convincing one way or another. I think I may just go without it and roll the dice, but be absolutely sure not to use the insulation I linked with the built in barrier as that may just make the issue worse to be honest.\n\n\n> Should be fine, but you might want to consider a treated subfloor below your finished \"flooring\".

Either a) you didn't sand well enough and the old finish is preventing the stain from absorbing (or old stain is seeping out) if you actually used stain, b) you stained with that stain/polyurethane mix and put on too thick of a coat, causing the orange peel effect.\n\nIf its the first, you need to sand it down again until you have good grain. That only works if it is a solid wood bookshelf and not veneer -- easy enough to tell by flipping it upside down and looking for the partical board/OSB that they never cover on the bottom.\n\nIf you used the polystain, /u/distantreplay has the right idea. Lightly sand, clean, reapply with thin even coats.\n\nIf you used a normal (real) stain, and didn't wipe it clean, you've got dried stain. Use a bit of lacquer thinner on a rag to clean it up (and be careful with the used rags because they CAN spontaneously combust -- let them dry completely outside and not in a pile before discarding).", "id": "danzrn7"}, {"comment": "It's a stain.

Top coat: use a very high quality brush made for your finish, brush in one direction only, continuously maintaining a wet edge. Brush from dry into wet edge, feathering and lifting the  brush gently as you finish each brush stroke. Before you start make a plan intended to allow you to maintain a wet working edge. Break the application down logically to avoid ever working back into a tacky surface. If already did these things and you used waterborne stains/finish here's what may be happening: waterborne materials are absorbed into wood fibers and the fibers swell raising \"hairs\" along the grain pattern. The trick is to sand these off very lightly with very fine grain paper and use a waterborne sanding sealer before applying finish. In this case, your first coats of finish will act as sealer.

It would be trivial for that lamp to fall off a table, tug on the cord, and cause the wires to pull loose from the wire nuts and touch each other.  Notice too that all xmas lights you can buy today have fuses inside the plug he cut off.  So, there's that, too.\n\nYou can solder them, and then cover with a heat shrink tubing.  That'd be safer.  But, you'd also want one of those things that holds a power cord in a hole, the name of which I can't recall at the moment.\n\nFinally, one other way to do it is to run the switch cord all the way into the lamp socket, and also run the xmas light cord into the socket, and connect the wires on the screws in the lamp socket.  That way you'd never see the splice at all.\n", "id": "damq39u"}, {"comment": "That would be the correct answer.\n\nSolder is always safer, no risk of getting loose wires.
