So it's just a bunch of particles floating around not really doing anything and not interacting with one another; there is no random motion at all. The distribution of galaxies across the universe is almost always modeled as a dust, as you know. The stress-energy tensor for a (massive) dust is T^(ab) = \u03f1u^(a)u^(b), where \u03f1 is the mass density and u^(a) is the 4-velocity of the fluid.\n\nFor massless particles, this at once doesn't make much sense. For one, massless particles don't have a 4-velocity. Second, a perfect fluid is defined as an inviscid fluid with no heat conduction *in its instantaneous co-moving rest frame*, and such frames don't exist for massless particles. The only way to really generalize the expression T^(ab) = \u03f1u^(a)u^(b) to massless particles is T^(ab) = p^(a)p^(b)/p^(0). (For massive particles, this reduces to mu^(a)u^(b), so there's still the issue of dividing by a volume to get a sort-of momentum or energy density, hence the introduction of delta functions, and hence all the problems.) So in analogy, I've seen most people just call such an object a \"null dust\", and the only reasonable physical interpretation of it is as a homogeneous collection of non-interacting, massless particles, or just simply massless radiation.

The innate are, to use a video game analogy, all the non-specific \"passive\" defenses of the body.  For example, inflammation, skin, and enzymes designed to digest viral-specific dsRNA are all innate portions of the immune system.  Like passive systems in video games, the innate system is designed to slow down pathogens until the active system comes into play.\n\nThe active system is the hunter-killer of the immune system.  Immune cells are basically split into 3 important types: killer T cells, helper T cells, and B cells.  Killer T cells recognize cells that are infected with viruses and destroy them.  Helper T cells bind to \"trash collector\" cells that go aroud digesting cellular debris.  B cells are recruited by helper T cells to produce antibodies that bind to the recognized pathogens and act as \"kill me now\" flags.\n\nThe one flaw of the active system is that since each killer and helper T cells are specific to only one pathogen, it can take a very long time for a specific T cell to be able to detect and recognize the pathogen and create an immune response.\n\nPeople with stronger immune systems may have more immune cells, systems able to better move immune cells around, or may be just lucky (since the protein on T cells that recognize pathogens is randomly generated).\n\nThis is a ridiculouslu simplified version.  There are dozens of other nuances and steps in the immune system."], [119, "People here are giving vague overviews because immunology is complicated, so I'll just add a concrete example of something that is measurable that can result in better or worse immunity. And this is the MHC repertoire that you have, which is genetically encoded. MHCs are the molecules that present fragments of proteins (for example, from viruses infecting your cells) from cells in your body to immune cells for recognition. These vary widely from human to human, and you can have up to 6 different types for MHC class I, for example. Having a more diverse set of MHC molecules allows for presentation of a wider range of peptide fragments and therefore better immunity. This has been studied fairly extensively and is termed the \"MHC heterozygote advantage.\""], [44, "It's true that people have different efficiencies in their immune systems, but when people talk about this stuff, it probably more accurately reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how the immune system works. When I hear this kind of thing, what I hear are comments like \"I got sick 6 times this year, therefore I must have a weak immune system.\"\n\nIn reality, this person got sick 6 times because they were EXPOSED 6 times to 6 different strains of a virus. Their immune system works just fine so they recovered normally each time. \n\nSometimes I think that laypeople expect their immune system to destroy every virus they are exposed to before it causes symptoms, but that's just not how it works. "], [21, "This is a broad question with a lot of different answers. I'll offer one perspective.\n\nYour immune system can be broken up into two categories: adaptive and innate. Adaptive immunity is something that has to be primed. Its specific. The body is trained to identify (via antigens) and destroy (via antibodies) something very specific. This is what happens when you get vaccinated - you are showing your body what to destroy.\n\nThere's also the innate immune system, which identifies more general signs of an infection via multiple mechanisms.\n\nSo a \"good\" immune system can be a number of things. The body has to balance in how sensitive to bad stuff it is. If its too gung-ho, you run the risk of developing autoimmune diseases (ex - diabetes type 1, celiac disease etc). If it is too conservative, you run the risk of being prone to infection.\n\nHaving a good immune system could be interpreted as having a sensitive, but not too sensitive immune system.\n\nAnother factor could be how many antigens you have been exposed to via your adaptive immune system. Playing in dirt as a kid means you were exposed to lots of stuff, and thus you could have antibodies for more pathogens than a normal person.\n\nAlso, breastfeeding infants allows infants to use antibodies from the mother, meaning while breastfeeding the infant has antibodies for what the mother has been exposed to.\n\nImmunology is a really complicated subject, and this is just a oversimplified and overly short list.  "], [18, "Alright, this answer is stupid complex, and can go on for days. There are whole semesters devoted to the understanding of the human immune system, and disciplines in how it works, and those disciplines have sub specialties. This is a deep deep DEEP rabbit hole one can fall down, but also awesomely fascinating. My background. A year of microbiology and bacteriology, and a year of anatomy and physiology, and I am a nursing student.  My understanding of it scratches the surface, but I hope it can help answer your question. To quote Carl Sagan, \" If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\" \n\nThe name of the game in immunology is for the body to fight off infection before it gets out of control. The bad stuff out there is bad because of many different reasons, bad stuff like HIV, Ebola, Plague, TB, Smallpox, C.Diff just to name a few all kill us, some fast, some slow, and are difficult to treat, or cure, or prevent, for more reasons than I can even tell you.\n\nOn the basic level, we have two main branches of our immune system: Innate and Adaptive. Calling them branches is doing a disservice, it's more like the top of a cascade web. Part of the team is the innate, the other part is the adaptive, and they work together for the bad stuff. \n\nThe innate, or basic immune system is just that, not descriptive, and works right away when exposed. This system is HUGE! So many parts to it, I will try and touch on a few. \n\nWe'll use dendritic cells, they are commonly found in your skin layers deeper than the outer layer of skin, the water repelling one. When they see a pathogen, they will commonly take it up, put it into a sac, and put lysing agents into it to break down the cell, these can be many things, but it's not important what they are, just that they break down the cell. These cells are special, they have a part called an \"Antigen Presenting Complex\", or APC (Sometimes APC is also used for antigen presenting cell, but its essentially the same thing). The APC is important, because it is a special Major histocompatibility complex or MHC. Every cell in your entire body has a MHC class 1 cell, or MHC-1 (except for red blood cells, its why RBC can be infused easily, but a kidney cant just be tossed in anyone without compatibility). Those special cells with the APC have MHC-2. You can think of MHC as flag holders. MHC hold your own cells. Your identifier. MHC-2 is like holding a flag and saying \"These guys are invaders, let's kill them!\"\n\nOk, so we have the difference between, MHC 1 and 2. This is very important. With your innate immune systems, it sees bacteria easily as foreign invaders and can easily keep up with a lot of infections, and eats them as they go. Your main eating cell, a neutrophil eats everything as they go, but do not have an APC. They are also the main makeup of pus for instance. \n\nWell let's say the infection is a bit faster than the innate immune system in its killing. So that same dendritic cell, still working like it does, takes a part of the bacteria it just took in, and puts its in its MHC 2 spot. It then ventures to the lymphatic vessels, looking for help. Now the MHC-2 is very specific. When you are young, your immune system is still building, making a ton of different cells, with slight variabilities. Flags was a bit too generous they are more like keys. So your dendritic cell in essence is taking its key and trying to unlock every lock it sees, until eureka, it finds one. This lock is typically a helper T cell. The helper T cell is activated by a chemical signaling released when it pairs with that APC, no pairing, no chemical signaling. \n\nOnce activated the helper T cells whip into action. They start coding cytotoxic or \"killer\" T cells for their activated antigen. (For this I will write them as Tc-cells, and helper T cells as Th-cells). So with Tc-Cells being activated, Th-Cells also start dividing and activating B-Cells. \n\nB-Cells turn into plasma cells and start releasing different antibodies to help the innate immune system do its job. On the basic level your adaptive immune system is activated. This system is not fast though, at all. On first exposure to a new pathogen it can take on average 10-14 days to activate. On secondary exposures it can activate faster because while those Th-Cells divide to make new Th-Cells to activate more stuff, they also make T-memory cells. Essentially putting more locks out there to be unlocked by a key, and takes anywhere from 12-72 hours to hit its peak. \n\nSo what does this adaptive immune system do? Well to understand that fully, you need to understand a few things first about MHC 1. Ok so like I said, nearly every cell in your body has MHC 1. What is it? Its like a flag, but a barcode. That barcode is essentially a piece of your DNA, that says \"I am self, do not kill\" when read. If the cell is infected with a virus, it instead puts a piece of this virus in that MHC 1 complex, and when it is read, is flagged to be killed. You can feel this happening for instance, when you have a sore throat from the flu, its the cell death. \n\nOk, so what next? So I kinda scratched the surface of innate immunity. There are lots of ways this is done, but on a basic basic basic level, innate immune system destroys invading pathogens by either eating them or causing them by way of something called the \"Complement system\" that involves many proteins that bind together and punch holes in the cell and destroy it. Plasma cells assist in this, a lot, making the innate systems job easier. Plasma cells are like mortar fire in war, they don't directly kill things, but release antibodies known as immunoglobulins, there are many kinds, but they break down to major types. IgG, IgE, IgA, IgM, and IgD. Each plasma cell releases antibodies specific to its coding for that pathogen. For the most part, they are Y shaped, or combinations of Y shapes. They two top tips of Y are specific binding, the single tale usually is not. So what do these antibodies do? Well a lot of things. They congregate pathogens so phagocytic cells can take a \"bigger bite\" IE work efficiently. Those non specific also are markers to make it easier for phagocytic cells to \"see\". They also can activate the complement pathway. \n\n----------------------\n\nOKAY! So we have set the universe up on a basic basic basic level. So maybe I can kind of answer your question. Based on what you have said, all those are theories, and possibilities. Genetic diversity is wildly large. We can look to other creatures for some insite. Alligators for instance have amazingly strong innate immune systems. Think about it, they live in a swamp filled with all kinds of pathogens, and haven't died out from their own plague, getting scrapes, cuts, and all kinds of things that compromise their barriers. They also have other parts of their innate immune system that makes it work better. Penicillin is from a fungus that produces a beta-lactam ring that comprises bacterial cell wall synthesis. Descendants of black plague survivors have an immunity to HIV, because of a mutation where HIV binds to. Sickle cell disease offers resistance to malaria, if you know anyone with it, when they get sick they can have a sickle cell crisis from it. Ebola is so dangerous because it spreads fast because it suppresses part of our immune system in synthesis, its not ebola that kills you, its your immune system trying to keep up that kills you.

Newborns don't have many of the specific immunities form the T cell pathway, due to not having an immune system, and thus get their antibodies from a mother's breast milk, who was likely exposed to the pathogen as well and is fighting it off unnoticed. \n\nGood lord that got long, and I hoped I answered your question somewhat. It is wildly complex."], [11, "Here is an example of a \"bad\" immune system that I have personal experience with.  \n\nMy wife unfortunately has Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID).  She is deficiency in all three major types of immumoglobulins: immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) while others have a shortage of just IgG and IgA. The diagnosis is made by finding that functional antibodies are very low or absent.\n\nCommon Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID) is a type of primary immunodeficiency, which is defined as an immune system dysfunction typically caused by a mutation in a gene or genes. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes more than 180 primary immunodeficiencies ranging from relatively common to quite rare.\n\nCVID is one of the most prevalent of the symptomatic primary immunodeficiencies and manifests a wide variability of symptoms and range of severity. It is considered a diverse group of diseases of unknown cause (etiology) as many different immune system defects have been found to lead this syndrome. CVID is characterized by a low level of specific proteins (antibodies, also called immunoglobulins) in the fluid portion of the blood which results in a decreased ability to fight invading microorganisms, toxins, or other foreign substances. These immunoglobulins are produced by specialized white blood cells (B cells) as they mature into plasma cells.\n\nThe cause of CVID is unknown in at least 90% of cases, and a genetic cause has been identified in less than 10%. Sporadic cases, with no apparent history of the disorder in their family is the commonest form and may be caused by a complex interaction of environmental and genetic components (multifactorial inheritance), but genes that are involved in the development and function of B cells are believed to be the primary cause.\n\nDue to my wife's inability to make he own anti-bodies she has to be infused monthly with all three major types of immumoglobulins: immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM).  \n\nFor more information go to: https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/common-variable-immune-deficiency/\n\nHopefully this a welcome addition to the discussion.\n\nRegards\n"], [5, "Good is very subjective-the properties which allow for superior reaction to pathogens is also probably not great for you in the long run, causing inflamation, oxidative damage, and occasionally self antigen recognition. Then there is the issue of immune longevity, as once we reach adulthood, our thymus (organ responsible for training our adaptive immunity) slowly atrophies. In old age, you might want the ability to fight pneumonia or a tumor. Tune the violin too loose, nothing happens, too tight, and you snap. Sometimes, less is more."], [4, "From a strictly scientific standpoint there is no such thing. Host-pathogen interactions are really complex and there isn't one \"it\" factor that makes for a good vs bad immune system. So the answer to all your questions, is a very unsatisfying, sometimes. But I'll go into more detail. \n\nEarly detection is important and the earlier the body detects a pathogen the earlier it can respond, this is why we get vaccines. However, early detection of a pathogen doesn't mean we won't get sick. And depending on our immune history, different exposures may or not make us sick. Then of course there are examples where immune system activation is a bad thing, e.g. allergic reactions, different auto-immune diseases. \n\nAnecdotally we can all think of people who are sick all the time, and there are those who rarely get sick. The simplified answer to this is that the immune system is part of your body, if you take care of your body (eating right, exercise, being outside, not smoking) you are going to be healthly and as a result so will your immune system. Of course more complex factors are also involved (e.g. genetics, epigenetics, the microbiome, immune history, etc.) \n\ntl;dr host-pathogen interactions are a shit-show, but healthy people generally have good immune systems "], [3, "I would really like to understand this, since I believe I have a better than average immune system.. bad food won't faze me, people could be coughing their guts out at the office (both around me and in the building, thank you closed air conditioning), everyone at home could be sick together, yet I never get sick! I am yet to understand this and I'd love to know why it happens. I haven't been to a doctor in years.\n\nAt the other end of this story is the bit where until I was like 10 I used to be super weak/sick and my parents were always shuttling me from one doctor to another for a myriad of illnesses. Then suddenly my immune system did an about turn!"], [3, "I would say having a \"good\" immune system would mean having a robust enough system to fight off invaders, but simultaneously having a system that can turn \"off\" effectively. More immune cells is not necessarily a good thing. In fact, a huge amount of disease processes are caused by an overreaction of the immune system and too many WBCs.\n\nAnother important characteristic of a \"good\" immune system (beyond regulation) is genetic. We have certain genes known as HLA genes that encode for receptors that recognize foreign invaders (through a biochemical \"fitting\" process). Having higher diversity in these genes allows you to find the right match sooner and mount a more rapid immune response.\n\nInterestingly the two concepts are related. There are certain HLA genes that predispose individuals to immune dysregulation and autoimmune disease (e.g. HLA-B27 for ankylosing spondylitis)."], [3, "Most people are talking about their passive immune system if they never get sick. But part of that can be exposure. Part of it can just be keeping clean like regularly washing your hands. And part of it can be keeping fit, because your lymphatics that pump all the garbage to be broken down are not pumping, then the infection will just grow there. \n\nIf you get sick but get over it quickly, your immune system can remember. And if it sees something it remembers it can fix you up in days verses weeks. Having this memory comes from exposure. There is a theory that babies stick everything in their mouth to get a good exposure for later in life. So maybe a good immune system comes from drinking out of the toilet as a child.

You can have a mutation in a protein that essentially makes you immune to HIV. Does that mean you have a better immune system? Not necessarily. You might be more susceptible to something else. Barring some mutation, to say that someone has a better immune system or not is a pretty BS answer. One example that does work and has been suggested in how diverse your Majorhistocompatibility complex (MHC) repertoire is. There are some genetic differences that make your immune system more \"active\" but that also increases the chance of autoimmunity....\n\n\nSo basically to answer your question...

The immune system is actually over 2 dozen different body cells that behave in certain ways, each with their own specific jobs. I found [this video](https://youtu.be/zQGOcOUBi6s) particularly helpful in understanding just how complex the immune system is, and how your body fights infections.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation I also found the [Crash Course videos on the immune system very educational (#45 to #47 on the playlist).](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOAKed_MxxWBNaPno5h3Zs8)"], [2, "T-cells aren't specific and B-cells don't need T-cells for anything. T-cells act innately, through molecular signals called cytokines that recruit other innate immune lymphocytes to the area where the pathogen is such as macrophages or neutrophils that can engulf the foreign pathogen or release toxic granules that destroy the pathogen. If it is a viral or bacterial pathogen it recruits immune cells that will kill the infected \"self\" cell eliminating any chance of that infected cell from spreading. Every cell has generic receptors(major histocompatibility complex-MHCs) that present pieces of a pathogen from inside the cell (class I MHCs) special immune cells like dendritic cells that hangout between tissues have both class I and class II MHCs, class II MHCs present pieces of a pathogen from the extracellular environment. These pieces of pathogen on these special complex bind to T-cells receptors, but the pathogen isn't specific to the T-cells it binds, in fact MHCs cells present your own fragments of cellular proteins constantly as a way of telling your immune system that everything is all good in this cell/this area. \n\nB-cells are part of the adaptive immune system. They have immunoglobulins that only recognize and activate the immune specific pathogens. You could go your whole life with the immunoglobulins necessary to fight a parasitic pathogen but if you never get the parisite the B-cells making those specific immunoglobulins will never be activated to become \"adaptive\". What we mean by that is once activated, that B-cells will secrete free floating immunoglobulins called antibodies and that specific B-cell with specific capability to fight that pathogen will replicate a lot making memory B cells that, given the opportunity to encounter the same pathogen later on in life will be able to respond much more quickly and efficiently. That's how it is adaptive. \n\nIt should be mentioned that T-cells and B-cells are constantly working on different pathways and sometimes in concert but recruit and utilize many of the same immune cells just by different means and for different end goals. T-cells are first responders, B-cells because they are a little \"smarter\" and unique have a slower reaction time but have a sustained effect. \n\nA good immune system is one that can distinguish between self and nonself (determined in immature T-cell lymphocytes in the bone marrow and lymph vessels through negative and positive selection-which is more of a theory) by killing off t-cells that bind too well to self or by not killing off t-cells that don't bind well to self(+/-)\n\nMutations in the gene regions that code for antibodies is also a way the immune system could be limited, but at the same role that is somewhat how antibodies are able to have such a massive(3.0x108) diversity, it could even be more than that I don't remember entirely.  \n\nSo much more has to do with it and all parts of the immune system work I'm conjunction so it's hard to tell. This is a huge area of research that has blown up in the last decade because of our ability to more easily manipulate genes and cells lines, so we are now starting to be able to fight things like Cancer by pulling T-cells out enhancing them and reapplying them to a patient specific tumor. \n"], [2, "-walk 3-4 miles minimum every day (park in the back of the parking lot even when its cold)\n-take a multi-vitamin every day\n-don't over-wash your hands, nor your childrens (germs can be good, especially later in life)\n-take extra vitamin C, always\n\ni dunno if this actually works but I haven't been sick in over 10 years & I just visited the hospital today due to a bike injury: perfect blood pressure & cholesterol even though chipotle is a weekly visit.\n\nwalk more - its fun & you get to know your neighbors & local businesses."], [-3, "This gets complicated and can cover a whole range of things.

Like passive systems in video games, the innate system is designed to slow down pathogens until the active system comes into play.\n\nThe active system is the hunter-killer of the immune system.  Immune cells are basically split into 3 important types: killer T cells, helper T cells, and B cells.  Killer T cells recognize cells that are infected with viruses and destroy them.  Helper T cells bind to \"trash collector\" cells that go aroud digesting cellular debris.  B cells are recruited by helper T cells to produce antibodies that bind to the recognized pathogens and act as \"kill me now\" flags.\n\nThe one flaw of the active system is that since each killer and helper T cells are specific to only one pathogen, it can take a very long time for a specific T cell to be able to detect and recognize the pathogen and create an immune response.\n\nPeople with stronger immune systems may have more immune cells, systems able to better move immune cells around, or may be just lucky (since the protein on T cells that recognize pathogens is randomly generated).\n\nThis is a ridiculouslu simplified version.

", "id": "daqg4uo"}, {"comment": "This is a very simple answer to a complicated question, but I'll do my best. \n\nProteins are generated from nucleic acids. In order for a protein to be functional, the nucleic acids have to code for amino acids that a) line up to make a full length protein and b) fold up correctly through electrostatic interactions. \n\nImmune cells start as undifferentiated, pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow. As they begin to develop, they receive signals from the body to differentiate. This means that they start expressing a specific set of genes, aka nucleic acid sequences. The sequences code for proteins called antibodies, which have a specific Y shape. \n\nHere's the real nitty gritty of your question: each antibody is generated by an event called differential splicing. All the immunity genes for antibodies come in chunks of sequences, which make up individual parts of the Y shape antibody, known as the heavy chain and the light chain. If you combine the chunks of sequences differently, you get a variety of antibody structures, with characteristic light and heavy chains. This is a random event (the order of the chunks, and which ones), hence the randomly generated antibody. \n\nNow, each cell starts out expressing a certain type of antibody, called IgG. This is characterized by heavy and light chains, which again, correspond to certain sequences within immunity gene clusters. \n\nSo now you have a bunch of cells with their own IgG antibody, ready for action. However, before they're let loose in the body, they have to be tested to make sure they function correctly. \n\nA side note about antibodies: proteins bind to each other through electrostatic interactions. Antibodies bind other proteins by their light chains, or the v-shaped part of the Y (the heavy chain is attached to the immune cell). Now, in order for the light chains to bind something (i.e. a pathogen, but more on that later) the electrostatic interactions have to be favorable. In other words, the shape of the light chain defines whether it can bind anything, also known as specificity, or recognition. \n\nBack to your question. Since each antibody is randomly generated, there's no guarantee that the antibody will bind anything, but it's still important to screen them because it might happen that one of the arrangements binds a protein that *your* cells express. This would basically tell the immune system that *your* cells are a pathogen, and need to be destroyed. This is the crux of autoimmune disorders- when your immune system can't differentiate between your own cells and foreign cells, and starts attacking your own body, aka bad news bears. \n\nSo moving forward, you have your cells and they've been screened for cross reactivity with your own cells and they passed. They're then released into the blood stream to hunt down pathogens. Some cells may never encounter something that their antibodies recognize. But, if a cell does encounter its pathogen (recognition), then, oversimply stated, it tells the rest of the immune system that it's found a bug, and 'rallies the troops.'\n\nThis is where the process gets truly complicated. Immune cells basically talk to each other and the cell that recognized the pathogen is told to start proliferating, making more cells that have the same antibody. During each subsequent round of division, the antibody changes a little bit (this is called class switching, where IgG switches to other types, like IgM, etc...those details aren't important though). \n\nSo as the antibody changes incrementally, it might produce versions that lose their ability to recognize the pathogen. However, a small amount are produced that do a *better* job binding the pathogen. They then talk to the immune system, and proliferate, and the cycle repeats. \n\nThis whole process takes several days, and is the basis for immune system memory; once a cell that recognizes a pathogen is generated, it and its progeny can circulate in the blood stream for years. So when your vaccinated, it's basically a doctor introducing a tiny, harmless part of a pathogen into the body so that your immune system can generate these cells before you're ever exposed to the real thing. That way, when you do become infected, your immune response is highly specific and very, very fast compared to if your immune system had never seen it before. \n\nSo in the context of the thread here, a 'good' immune system has the widest variety of immune genes, which can produce the widest variety of antibodies, which gives the immune system the best chance of recognizing pathogens and destroying them before they destroy you. And you get your variety of immune system genes from your parents. So if your parents' genes differ a lot from each other, then you're going to have a larger variety, as their offspring receiving genes from both of them.\n\nI would link to some cool papers about mate selection being influenced by how different your partners' immune gene are from yours, but I'm on mobile. You could google it though, search for MHC and a study about women smelling mens' tshirts and rating how attractive they found the smell, it's a well known study. \n\nHope that clarifies some questions in this thread.

The body does this as a way to account for any antigen that could be present in the body, and when an antigen binds to a TCR, it induces replication and differentiation of T-cells and B-cells, effectively inducing our adaptive immune response and immune memory. \n\nAs far as the autoimmune disease part goes, T-cells normally cannot bind directly to an antigen. Instead, complexes called APCs (antigen presenting complexes) digest a pathogen then present (through surface expression) an antigen to T-cells. When an APC is presenting an antigen, it is referred to as a Major Histocompatibility Complex (or MHC), and MHCs are characterized as either Class I or Class 2 based on the cell surface markers it expresses. Additionally, MHCs can present antigens classified as either \"self\" or \"non-self\", and that distinction is key preventing autoimmune attack.

If one type of cytotoxic T-cell (CD8+ T-killer cell) recognizes a foreign antigen on a MHC multimer present on the cell surface of the infected cell, it will divide clonally to produce more of the same type of T-Cell that recognizes the specific antigen as well as a line of T-Cells that divide at a background rate that serve as your immunological memory (your body will be ready next time it finds the same antigen, and will produce even more T-Cells in response to a second time recognizing the specific antigen).

I'll offer one perspective.\n\nYour immune system can be broken up into two categories: adaptive and innate. Adaptive immunity is something that has to be primed. Its specific. The body is trained to identify (via antigens) and destroy (via antibodies) something very specific. This is what happens when you get vaccinated - you are showing your body what to destroy.\n\nThere's also the innate immune system, which identifies more general signs of an infection via multiple mechanisms.\n\nSo a \"good\" immune system can be a number of things. The body has to balance in how sensitive to bad stuff it is. If its too gung-ho, you run the risk of developing autoimmune diseases (ex - diabetes type 1, celiac disease etc). If it is too conservative, you run the risk of being prone to infection.\n\nHaving a good immune system could be interpreted as having a sensitive, but not too sensitive immune system.\n\nAnother factor could be how many antigens you have been exposed to via your adaptive immune system. Playing in dirt as a kid means you were exposed to lots of stuff, and thus you could have antibodies for more pathogens than a normal person.\n\nAlso, breastfeeding infants allows infants to use antibodies from the mother, meaning while breastfeeding the infant has antibodies for what the mother has been exposed to.\n\nImmunology is a really complicated subject, and this is just a oversimplified and overly short list.  ", "id": "dapd5yt"}], [{"comment": "Alright, this answer is stupid complex, and can go on for days. There are whole semesters devoted to the understanding of the human immune system, and disciplines in how it works, and those disciplines have sub specialties. This is a deep deep DEEP rabbit hole one can fall down, but also awesomely fascinating. My background. A year of microbiology and bacteriology, and a year of anatomy and physiology, and I am a nursing student.  My understanding of it scratches the surface, but I hope it can help answer your question. To quote Carl Sagan, \" If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\" \n\nThe name of the game in immunology is for the body to fight off infection before it gets out of control. The bad stuff out there is bad because of many different reasons, bad stuff like HIV, Ebola, Plague, TB, Smallpox, C.Diff just to name a few all kill us, some fast, some slow, and are difficult to treat, or cure, or prevent, for more reasons than I can even tell you.\n\nOn the basic level, we have two main branches of our immune system: Innate and Adaptive. Calling them branches is doing a disservice, it's more like the top of a cascade web. Part of the team is the innate, the other part is the adaptive, and they work together for the bad stuff. \n\nThe innate, or basic immune system is just that, not descriptive, and works right away when exposed. This system is HUGE! So many parts to it, I will try and touch on a few. \n\nWe'll use dendritic cells, they are commonly found in your skin layers deeper than the outer layer of skin, the water repelling one. When they see a pathogen, they will commonly take it up, put it into a sac, and put lysing agents into it to break down the cell, these can be many things, but it's not important what they are, just that they break down the cell. These cells are special, they have a part called an \"Antigen Presenting Complex\", or APC (Sometimes APC is also used for antigen presenting cell, but its essentially the same thing). The APC is important, because it is a special Major histocompatibility complex or MHC. Every cell in your entire body has a MHC class 1 cell, or MHC-1 (except for red blood cells, its why RBC can be infused easily, but a kidney cant just be tossed in anyone without compatibility). Those special cells with the APC have MHC-2. You can think of MHC as flag holders. MHC hold your own cells. Your identifier. MHC-2 is like holding a flag and saying \"These guys are invaders, let's kill them!\"\n\nOk, so we have the difference between, MHC 1 and 2. This is very important. With your innate immune systems, it sees bacteria easily as foreign invaders and can easily keep up with a lot of infections, and eats them as they go. Your main eating cell, a neutrophil eats everything as they go, but do not have an APC. They are also the main makeup of pus for instance. \n\nWell let's say the infection is a bit faster than the innate immune system in its killing. So that same dendritic cell, still working like it does, takes a part of the bacteria it just took in, and puts its in its MHC 2 spot. It then ventures to the lymphatic vessels, looking for help. Now the MHC-2 is very specific. When you are young, your immune system is still building, making a ton of different cells, with slight variabilities. Flags was a bit too generous they are more like keys. So your dendritic cell in essence is taking its key and trying to unlock every lock it sees, until eureka, it finds one. This lock is typically a helper T cell. The helper T cell is activated by a chemical signaling released when it pairs with that APC, no pairing, no chemical signaling. \n\nOnce activated the helper T cells whip into action. They start coding cytotoxic or \"killer\" T cells for their activated antigen. (For this I will write them as Tc-cells, and helper T cells as Th-cells). So with Tc-Cells being activated, Th-Cells also start dividing and activating B-Cells. \n\nB-Cells turn into plasma cells and start releasing different antibodies to help the innate immune system do its job. On the basic level your adaptive immune system is activated. This system is not fast though, at all. On first exposure to a new pathogen it can take on average 10-14 days to activate. On secondary exposures it can activate faster because while those Th-Cells divide to make new Th-Cells to activate more stuff, they also make T-memory cells. Essentially putting more locks out there to be unlocked by a key, and takes anywhere from 12-72 hours to hit its peak. \n\nSo what does this adaptive immune system do? Well to understand that fully, you need to understand a few things first about MHC 1. Ok so like I said, nearly every cell in your body has MHC 1. What is it? Its like a flag, but a barcode. That barcode is essentially a piece of your DNA, that says \"I am self, do not kill\" when read. If the cell is infected with a virus, it instead puts a piece of this virus in that MHC 1 complex, and when it is read, is flagged to be killed. You can feel this happening for instance, when you have a sore throat from the flu, its the cell death. \n\nOk, so what next? So I kinda scratched the surface of innate immunity. There are lots of ways this is done, but on a basic basic basic level, innate immune system destroys invading pathogens by either eating them or causing them by way of something called the \"Complement system\" that involves many proteins that bind together and punch holes in the cell and destroy it. Plasma cells assist in this, a lot, making the innate systems job easier. Plasma cells are like mortar fire in war, they don't directly kill things, but release antibodies known as immunoglobulins, there are many kinds, but they break down to major types. IgG, IgE, IgA, IgM, and IgD. Each plasma cell releases antibodies specific to its coding for that pathogen. For the most part, they are Y shaped, or combinations of Y shapes. They two top tips of Y are specific binding, the single tale usually is not. So what do these antibodies do? Well a lot of things. They congregate pathogens so phagocytic cells can take a \"bigger bite\" IE work efficiently. Those non specific also are markers to make it easier for phagocytic cells to \"see\". They also can activate the complement pathway. \n\n----------------------\n\nOKAY! So we have set the universe up on a basic basic basic level. So maybe I can kind of answer your question. Based on what you have said, all those are theories, and possibilities. Genetic diversity is wildly large. We can look to other creatures for some insite. Alligators for instance have amazingly strong innate immune systems. Think about it, they live in a swamp filled with all kinds of pathogens, and haven't died out from their own plague, getting scrapes, cuts, and all kinds of things that compromise their barriers. They also have other parts of their innate immune system that makes it work better. Penicillin is from a fungus that produces a beta-lactam ring that comprises bacterial cell wall synthesis. Descendants of black plague survivors have an immunity to HIV, because of a mutation where HIV binds to. Sickle cell disease offers resistance to malaria, if you know anyone with it, when they get sick they can have a sickle cell crisis from it. Ebola is so dangerous because it spreads fast because it suppresses part of our immune system in synthesis, its not ebola that kills you, its your immune system trying to keep up that kills you. Hepatitis B, your immune system is responsible for the liver damage. Autoimmune diseases can come after an infection that had a pathogen present similar to some of your cells. Newborns don't have many of the specific immunities form the T cell pathway, due to not having an immune system, and thus get their antibodies from a mother's breast milk, who was likely exposed to the pathogen as well and is fighting it off unnoticed. \n\nGood lord that got long, and I hoped I answered your question somewhat.

It is considered a diverse group of diseases of unknown cause (etiology) as many different immune system defects have been found to lead this syndrome.

These immunoglobulins are produced by specialized white blood cells (B cells) as they mature into plasma cells.\n\nThe cause of CVID is unknown in at least 90% of cases, and a genetic cause has been identified in less than 10%.

If it is a viral or bacterial pathogen it recruits immune cells that will kill the infected \"self\" cell eliminating any chance of that infected cell from spreading. Every cell has generic receptors(major histocompatibility complex-MHCs) that present pieces of a pathogen from inside the cell (class I MHCs) special immune cells like dendritic cells that hangout between tissues have both class I and class II MHCs, class II MHCs present pieces of a pathogen from the extracellular environment.

They have immunoglobulins that only recognize and activate the immune specific pathogens. You could go your whole life with the immunoglobulins necessary to fight a parasitic pathogen but if you never get the parisite the B-cells making those specific immunoglobulins will never be activated to become \"adaptive\". What we mean by that is once activated, that B-cells will secrete free floating immunoglobulins called antibodies and that specific B-cell with specific capability to fight that pathogen will replicate a lot making memory B cells that, given the opportunity to encounter the same pathogen later on in life will be able to respond much more quickly and efficiently. That's how it is adaptive. \n\nIt should be mentioned that T-cells and B-cells are constantly working on different pathways and sometimes in concert but recruit and utilize many of the same immune cells just by different means and for different end goals.

The surviving antibodies remain largely dormant until needed in T helper and B helper cells.\n\nBut this is only a single component of the \"immune system\". Firstly it's important to understand that you have two \"immune\" systems - innate immunity and acquired immunity. Both of these systems are made up themselves of a number of components. The innate immune system for example can utilise specialised cells called antigen presenting cells (which includes a whole host of subtypes). These cells quickly rush to an injury site and when encountering a foreign invader signal to the body to send reinforcements. These reinforcements can be antibodies or other cells in your innate immune system. There is also a secondary system called the \"complement system\", which triggers the production of something called the \"membrane attack complex\" (C5bC6C7C8[pC9]) that can literally punch holes in invading bacteria. These measures are all temporary and cause inflammation, but the purpose is to hold off the attackers as long as possible until the antibody portion of the immune system can arrive.\n\nThe difference in \"good\" or \"bad\" immune systems can stem from a number of factors, from slow response to pathogens in the innate stage - letting the invader really take hold and making it much harder to fight, to poor antibody specificity - perhaps from detrimental mutations to the heavy chain part of the antibody.", "id": "dapf0ci"}, {"comment": "This post is full of misinformation.

To expand a bit: one of the reasons aerodynamics is hard is because air is compressible - as pressure rises, density increases. On the other hand, water is considered incompressible - the density barely changes with pressure. We usually consider air to be incompressible at Mach numbers below 0.3 (where the change in density is less than ~5%) - so the low speed air coming in and out of your desktop behaves more like an incompressible fluid such as water.

With a desk fan, efficiency is secondary to raw airflow, and a fat blade has more area than a slender one with the same radius.

Before you do this measurement, the state of the electron is definitely \"spin pointing up.\" Then the electron's spin does not *have* a well-defined value along the left-right direction - the \"spin pointing up\" wave function is a superposition of \"spin left\" and \"spin right.\"\n\nWhen you measure its spin along the left-right axis (e.g. using a magnetic field designed to make the electron go in one direction or another based on its spin), it chooses either left or right at random, and then its wave function is \"definitely left\" or \"definitely right.\"\n\n\"Observing reality fundamentally changes it\" is a fluffy statement that isn't useful for anything.

When you measure the angular momentum along an arbitrarily-selected axis (denoted the z-axis), you will *never* in any measurement find that the full angular momentum of the electron is along that axis.  Rather, you will find that the component along the z-axis is either +1/2 or -1/2 (units of \u0127).  This means that the \"true\" spin vector (if there was such a thing) has been constrained by your measurement to be on one circular band of the sphere, but you don't know at which point on the circle the true spin vector points.  You might naively assume that you simply got unlucky and didn't choose the right axis along which to measure your angular momentum, but one of the quirks of quantum mechanics is that you're guaranteed to get such a result no matter what axis you choose, and you can't \"nail down\" the \"true\" angular momentum any better than you've already done (measuring along the y-axis to further constrain from a circle down to two points actually invalidates your original z-axis measurement, so repeating the z-axis measurement now is equally likely to result in +1/2 or -1/2).", "id": "daoryco"}, {"comment": "This is a good explanation and I should have said something about it.

That type of fusion requires much greater temperatures than simple hydrogen fusion (which is already high) but the output is 3 Alpha particles (helium nuclei). Hydrogen fusion produces a lot of neutrons, so the only way to extract  energy is to convert it to heat. So you need to go from flying neutrons to heat, use the heat for a boiler, and use the steam to run a turbine. Boron-hydrogen fusion products are charged particles so it's possible to directly harvest the energy, since moving charged particles can induce a current in a wire which is a lot more efficient.\n\nAdditionally, the neutrons produced by hydrogen fusion cause the inside of the confinement container to become radioactive, but boron-hydrogdn fusion produces so few neutrons that it's not an issue."], [2, "We fuse heavier nuclides all the time for experiments. But this is not useful for power generation, if that's what you're getting at."], [1, "First off, how does fusion work?\n\nYou take two nuclei and you place them close enough to each other, then the attraction of the strong nuclear force takes over and the nuclei fuse into one. As long as the nuclei you start with have less nuclear binding energy per nucleon than the final nucleus, you'll release energy in the reaction and it'll happen spontaneously.\n\nSo if fusion is so simple in principle why isn't it actually that simple? The main problem is that there's no way to just grab an atomic nucleus and move it about willy-nilly. The nucleus is much smaller than even single atoms, so it's not controllable directly. Worse, all stable atomic nuclei are positively electrically charged. Which means that they repel each other. And because nuclei are so small, the force of electrostatic repulsion when two nuclei are very near each other is enormous. This prevents nuclei from coming near each other normally. Which, on balance, is actually a good thing, because it means that fusion doesn't happen spontaneously all the time, otherwise the entire universe would just be one big neutron star which would have collapsed into a black hole before anything more interesting could happen.\n\nSo, how do we solve this problem? One way to do it is to accelerate nuclei towards each other. As the nuclei approach each other the electrostatic repulsion will cause them to slow down, but if they are going fast enough to start with they will still collide, and fuse. And this does indeed work, but it's not exactly practical. The amount of energy it takes to accelerate a single nucleus in a particle accelerator is a lot, vastly in excess of the amount of energy released by any fusion reactions. It's also not a viable energy source, because the rate of fusion reactions is fairly small.\n\nBut, if you can get a large number of nuclei all going at high speeds while being contained in a small space (at high density) then you would naturally get some of the nuclei hitting each other head on at some rate, causing fusion. The faster the particles and the higher the density the more likely such collisions would be, and the higher the fusion rate. There's a name for the property of a collection of particles bouncing around at high speeds: temperature. The conditions we need for fusion reactions to proceed at a high rate is a high temperature plasma constrained to be under high pressure. This is thermonuclear fusion. Of which there are several notable examples. Inside the cores of stars thermonuclear fusion happens because gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula creates heat, and the weight of the star under its own gravity keeps the core under high pressure and at a high density. Inside thermonuclear bombs where a fusion fuel capsule is compressed by the force of a fission bomb, creating fusion conditions momentarily under \"inertial\" confinement (the inertia of the implosion of the fusion fuel maintains fusion conditions long enough for a meaningful amount of fusion energy to be released). Or inside experiments using either inertial or magnetic confinement.\n\nYou can, of course, use higher atomic number elements in fusion, but remember the core problem of fusion, the electrostatic repulsion of the nuclei. The higher the atomic number the more charged the nucleus is, which correspondingly increases the force of repulsion. Fusing, say, Carbon together (atomic number 6) means overcoming a force of electrostatic repulsion that is *36* times stronger than that between Hydrogen nuclei. Which means you need to crank the nuclei speeds *way* up, corresponding to much higher temperature levels.\n\nAchieving much higher temperatures in fusion reactors is very, very difficult. It means you have to dump even more energy into the heating processes, which makes it even more difficult to attain any positive balance of energy production. Worse, in things like magnetic confinement fusion as you increase temperature the confinement becomes even more difficult. To attain the temperatures needed for fusing elements other than Hydrogen you need larger reactors with much stronger magnets, by significant factors, not just percentages. Fusing Deuterium and Helium-3 is nearly 4x as difficult as fusing Deuterium-Tritium. Proton-Boron-11 fusion, an enormously promising reaction due to the fact that it's very aneutronic, is roughly 10x as difficult.\n\nWe do want to be able to build fusion reactors that fuse other elements, but it's a more difficult problem than fusing Deuterium and Tritium, by a huge margin. There's no sensible way to acquire the technology for fusing other elements beyond simply building D-T fusion reactors and going on from there.\n\n**tl;dr**: higher atomic numbers means higher temperatures and much greater difficulty in attaining fusion conditions. We can't even build D-T fusion reactors that produce power yet, reactors that would fuse other elements would be even more difficult to build."]], [[{"comment": "It would be worse.

The binding energy of a nucleus is basically the amount of potential energy held in the bound-state the nucleus forms.  Put another way, it's the amount of energy you'd need to give it to break it apart.  In this way it's kind of like a negative/lack of energy in the sense that if something has initially zero energy, and then enters a state of binding energy 1 eV, then it must also acquire 1 eV of kinetic energy (so that 1 eV kinetic + (-1) eV potential = 0 energy, which is what it started with).  So if a system moves to a state with a higher binding energy that means it's given energy to motion and has gotten itself deeper into a \"potential energy hole\".  What that graph shows is binding energy PER nucleon, so the total amount divided by the number of nucleons (protons or neutrons) there are.\n\nSo consider a fusion reaction like (n means neutrons, p means protons):\n\nD (Deuterium = 1n + 1p) + He^3 (2p + 1n) -> He^4 (2n + 2p) + H^1 (1p)   \n\nso you have a total of 2n + 3p = 5 nucleons going in and 2n + 3p = 5 nucleons going out.  So where's the energy for fusion?  Well the binding energy per Nucleon of D is (I'm just eye balling from the graph I sent) 1 MeV, He^3 is 2.5 MeV, He^4 is 7 MeV and H^1 is 0 MeV (there's only one thing, it's just a proton, there is nothing bound).  So we have\n\nbinding energy PER nucleon x number of nucleons.  So we have going in:\n\n1 MeV x (1n + 1p = 2) + 2.5 MeV x (2p + 1n = 3) = 9.5 MeV of \"in the hole\" energy, assuming the reactants start at rest.\n\n7 MeV x (2n + 2p = 4) + 0 (1p) = 28 MeV of \"in the hole\" energy in what you end up with.  The difference is then about 18.5 MeV which is kinetic energy you get out.  That kinetic energy, which is heat, can drive a steam engine or what have you.\n\n\nWhich, btw, I just eye-balled values there, but looking the reaction up:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneutronic_fusion#Candidate_reactions\n\nThe real values is 18.3 MeV so... like... really close!

In other words, it's complicated.\n\nIf you have the complex plane, that is, all real and imaginary numbers, then you can have the exponential function e^(z), where z is any complex number. In particular, e^(ix) is equal to cos(x)+isin(x), hence e^(ipi)=-1. If we try to define a logarithm in the normal way, we run into problems. The normal way to define log(x) is that y=log(x) is the number so that e^(y)=x. The problem is that  e^(ix)=e^(ix+2ipi), so if we have log(z)=ix, then we should also have log(z)=ix+2ipi. For instance, e^(ipi)=-1, but also e^(3ipi)=-1, so the log should be both ipi and 3ipi. Obviously this can't happen.\n\nWhat is happening here? Well, the numbers e^(ix) give the unit circle that lies inside the complex plane, the point cos(x)+isin(x) in the complex plane is the same as the point (cos(x),sin(x)) on the Cartesian coordinate grid, which is a point on the unit circle. So increasing x makes you circle around the origin by an angle x. If you go to the angle x, and then go around a whole time, then you'll end up at the same spot. Trying to take a logarithm is then trying to ask what angle a point on the unit circle is. This might seem obvious at first, just don't go around multiple times, but there are situations where we my view an angle as 3pi/2 and another where we view is at -pi/2. So it is unclear what value a logarithm should have because each point on the unit circle will have a multiple different angles to give the logarithm.\n\nWe can fix this though. The issue happens because we are allowed to go around the circle a whole turn, so let's not let that happen. If we 1.) Fix a starting point, like log(1)=0, and 2.) Don't allow ourselves to go around a whole circle, then there will be no issue. To do this, we choose a ray pointing out of the origin, out towards infinity and we say that we cannot pass this line. We then say that the value of log(z) is whatever value it should be as long as we keep track of log(z) by originating at a fixed starting point and then making a path to z without crossing this ray.\n\nFor instance, we can choose this ray to be the ray that points straight down, and we can have our starting point be log(1)=0. If we then rotate around the unit circle, we'll get log(e^(ix))=ix, as long as -pi/2<x<3pi/2. In this case, log(-1)=ipi. We're also free to start with log(1)=2ipi, in which case log(-1)=3ipi. Changing the starting point and changing the line that we shall not pass gives different logarithm function that all serve the same purpose. Of course, if you're not working with complex numbers, then negative logarithms mean nothing. And when you do work with complex numbers, you have to be careful how you work with logarithms.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can get around this issue of having this line of no passing and starting points by moving from the complex plane to a different object. You place the positive part of the real axis where it usually would be, but instead of extending it to the complex plane by just rotating it through angles, as we rotate, we also lift. [Like a spiral staircase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_logarithm#/media/File:Riemann_surface_log.svg). By the time we've gone around one whole circle, instead of winding up where we began, which would be the case if we stayed in the plane, we're actually pointing in the same direction, but a floor above where we started. We can continue rotating, in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions to get an object that is an infinite spiral. A point on this spiral will be determined by how far it is from the origin, what direction it is pointing in *and* what floor it is on. Or, by the complex number it lives over and the floor it is on. If we're pointing along the negative direction, on the first floor and are a distance 1 away from the origin, then we're at -1 and on the first floor. Since this if the first floor, the logarithm is just ipi. If we go to the second floor, by spiraling around once more, then we're still at -1 but a floor above. The logarithm of this point is then 3ipi. On this infinite spiral, the logarithms are all nicely defined, it's just a little unclear what the logarithm of a number is because you need to also specify which floor it is on. So log(-1,1st floor)=ipi, log(-1,2ndfloor)=3ipi, log(1,5th floor)=8ipi etc.\n\nThere are related issues when talking about square roots and cube roots, etc. These all have new, different surfaces that classify them, like this staircase does for logarithms.

We can continue rotating, in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions to get an object that is an infinite spiral. A point on this spiral will be determined by how far it is from the origin, what direction it is pointing in *and* what floor it is on. Or, by the complex number it lives over and the floor it is on. If we're pointing along the negative direction, on the first floor and are a distance 1 away from the origin, then we're at -1 and on the first floor. Since this if the first floor, the logarithm is just ipi. If we go to the second floor, by spiraling around once more, then we're still at -1 but a floor above. The logarithm of this point is then 3ipi. On this infinite spiral, the logarithms are all nicely defined, it's just a little unclear what the logarithm of a number is because you need to also specify which floor it is on. So log(-1,1st floor)=ipi, log(-1,2ndfloor)=3ipi, log(1,5th floor)=8ipi etc.\n\nThere are related issues when talking about square roots and cube roots, etc. These all have new, different surfaces that classify them, like this staircase does for logarithms. These objects are called [Riemann Surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_surface), and they're super important for everything. \n\n", "id": "daq6s9o"}], [{"comment": "Gonna leave this here\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_identity\n\nYou cannot take the negative log of a negative number and end up with a REAL number mentioned by u/functor7.

Figuring out how and why a DNA-binding protein binds to a particular sequence is a shit-ton of work for any one particular protein. For example, [here's](http://i.imgur.com/ooRDLt7.png) a diagram of a protein (actually two of the same protein binding as a pair). In the top panel, see that ribbon that's inserted into the groove of DNA? The arrangement of that ribbon, and the individual amino acids of that ribbon, specify the sequence that it can interact with (see in bold at the top). [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/OiJodaR.png) an image that shows the individual protein-amino-acid-to-DNA-base interactions. \n\nBefore the discovery of the CRISPR protein Cas9, If you wanted to customize a DNA-binding protein sequence preference, you had to figure out what specific amino acid changes you wanted to make, which is a tall order. Mutating even one amino acid affects not only that sites interaction with DNA but also affects the next amino acid over, which affects the next one, and then also the amino acids that are close in 3D space, and on and on. \n\nEven finding proteins that were amenable to mutation in their DNA-binding regions was tricky. ZFNs and TALENs are just the most successful examples of modifying a DNA-binding protein to suit a particular sequence. And all this doesn't even get into the problems of preventing off-target binding, which can cause a problem with classic DNA-binding proteins that bind relatively short sequences and, since they have to parse large possibility spaces in a genome, physically [interact](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/10/3040.short) even with DNA of non-preferred sequence. \n\nWith Cas9 all that shit goes out the window. Since Cas9 binds to DNA using an *RNA* intermediary that immediately solves the problem of customization, since custom RNA is easily designed based on simple base pairing rules. And, synthesizing custom RNA costs pocket change and gets cheaper every day. Off-target binding is still an issue worth keeping in mind, but it gets easier to avoid all the time, especially with tools like [nickase Cas9](https://www.addgene.org/crispr/nick/).

Usually ordinary atomic forces, chemical and electromagnetic forces we're pretty familiar with, prevent stuff from occupying the same space.  But get enough mass together and electron repulsion doesn't matter any more and you can start forcing nuclei together, causing fusion and creating a star.\n\nIn a star the heat generated by fusion creates pressure.  In addition to simple thermal pressure, fusion also creates radiation and so outward pushing radiation pressure.  Fusion generated outward pressure is the main thing balancing stars.  This outward pressure from pressure counteracts the inward pressure of gravity.  These two sources of pressure counteract each other and the star maintains an approximate shape.  The smallest star, a [red dwarf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-VPyLaJFM), constantly cycles its supply of hydrogen and helium and doesn't have the layered internal structure predicted in most stars.  \nConsider a pot of boiling water, as water at the bottom heats it rises, then cools and falls back down.  In the red dwarf something similar happens, except that the source of heat is the gas undergoing fusion at the star's center.  Heat causes the gas to expand, move away from the center and carry its heat toward the surface.  This constant cycling creates enough fluid pressure that the inward pressure of gravity cannot compress the star any more.\n\nIf that pressure is no longer enough the star begins to collapse in on itself.  The next source of pressure that can hold it up is its electron degeneracy pressure.  This is a sort of fancy term that simply means that Fermions (like electrons) don't particularly like to be in the same place.  We've long past exceeded their electrical repulsion, this is caused by the Pauli exclusion principle.  Two electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state, so they cannot be compressed any more.  This creates an extremely dense object known as a [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf).\n\nToo much mass, however, and even this pressure is overcome and the star collapses into a [neutron star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik).  Eventually electrons and protons are forced together forming neutrons, and the only thing holding it up is the fundamental nuclear forces.  The entire mass of the star is compressed into an unbelievably dense piece of material, which functions a lot like a star-sized atom.  Except this atom is held together entirely by gravity, rather than the strong force.\n\nAdd yet more mass and there's nothing left to hold it up.  Gravity demands everything fall in, so fall in everything does.  Nuclear forces can't prevent all the stuff in a star from deciding to all occupy the same approximate point.

This implies that the Schwarzschild radius is a function of the mass not of the density meaning the black hole might have just compressed all the mass infinitely far inside it and the outside would not have changed. \n\nAnother more speculative thought is that with the infinite space curvature of a black hole the notion of distance must take on a different meaning as you can have an infinite distance between two points along a straight path between them. This implies that the density in and inside the the frame of the black hole could be infinitely small at any or most points as there is infinite distances along which matter could be distributed. \n\nTotally unfounded but kinda cool: The internal \"volume\" of a black hole might behave similar to a universe with one less spatial dimension meaning again no force would be required to keep it from shrinking and from a inside subjective perspective space would actually appear to be expanding/inflating as the hole formed and grew.  If the formation of a black hole behaves this way the spatial extent of the \"new\" space would expand(inflation) rapidly during its initial formation, as its Schwarzschild radius goes from the size of less than an atom to the size which results from consuming all very nearby matter nearly instantaneously. After which it would grow more slowly over time. This in turn looks alot like inflation following the big bang which is of course the point.  If I understood things the spatiotemporal axis would be permuted but from the inside this would not be understandable. \n\n\n", "id": "dapdhpf"}, {"comment": "> infinite space curvature of a black hole the notion of distance must take on a different meaning as you can have an infinite distance between two points along a straight path between them.\n\nThe only place you can theoretically have infinite curvature is at the singularity - which is a point - so it makes no sense to speak of infinite distances.

But yes, our sun, and all stars, are in a state of equilibrium with gravity pulling mass in and fusion heating the interior causing both gas and radiation pressure out.

If we keep things simple, there are only three things that can happen:\n\n1. Things are at equilibrium\n\n2. Outward pressure exceeds inward pressure\n\n3. Inward pressure exceeds outward pressure\n\nIf outward pressure exceeds inward pressure (and nothing changes) than everything just blows away.  If inward pressure exceeds outward pressure (and again, nothing changes), then you get a black hole.  So if you observe a star for any length of time and its still there, then it must be in some kind of equilibrium.  \n\nThere is yet another possibility: things can fluctuate.  Stars do this all the time.  Over time, the available hydrogen for fusion runs so low that the star cannot maintain the outward pressure and starts to collapse.  However, the added pressure changes things up so that other elements can start to undergo fusion.  The star actually expands in size, before even these elements are no longer enough.  But when this fusion starts to wane and the star begins to collapse, the pressure increases even more putting yet more elements into play.\n\nThe star can keep on bouncing like this until it's mostly iron in the core.  At that point, fusion is no longer an option and the star will meet its final fate, depending on its mass.\n\nIt's worth noting that equilibrium is a very slippery notion when it comes to stars.  Even our sun is changing ever so slightly, getting just a little bit bigger and just a little bit hotter.

As the star heats up, the particles have greater velocity, so there's a greater pressure present and the stars expands.

All matter wants to continue compressing indefinitely, but various other effects prevent it from doing so.  Usually ordinary atomic forces, chemical and electromagnetic forces we're pretty familiar with, prevent stuff from occupying the same space.  But get enough mass together and electron repulsion doesn't matter any more and you can start forcing nuclei together, causing fusion and creating a star.\n\nIn a star the heat generated by fusion creates pressure.  In addition to simple thermal pressure, fusion also creates radiation and so outward pushing radiation pressure.  Fusion generated outward pressure is the main thing balancing stars.  This outward pressure from pressure counteracts the inward pressure of gravity.  These two sources of pressure counteract each other and the star maintains an approximate shape.  The smallest star, a [red dwarf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-VPyLaJFM), constantly cycles its supply of hydrogen and helium and doesn't have the layered internal structure predicted in most stars.  \nConsider a pot of boiling water, as water at the bottom heats it rises, then cools and falls back down.  In the red dwarf something similar happens, except that the source of heat is the gas undergoing fusion at the star's center.  Heat causes the gas to expand, move away from the center and carry its heat toward the surface.  This constant cycling creates enough fluid pressure that the inward pressure of gravity cannot compress the star any more.\n\nIf that pressure is no longer enough the star begins to collapse in on itself.  The next source of pressure that can hold it up is its electron degeneracy pressure.  This is a sort of fancy term that simply means that Fermions (like electrons) don't particularly like to be in the same place.  We've long past exceeded their electrical repulsion, this is caused by the Pauli exclusion principle.  Two electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state, so they cannot be compressed any more.  This creates an extremely dense object known as a [white dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf).\n\nToo much mass, however, and even this pressure is overcome and the star collapses into a [neutron star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW3aV7U-aik).  Eventually electrons and protons are forced together forming neutrons, and the only thing holding it up is the fundamental nuclear forces.  The entire mass of the star is compressed into an unbelievably dense piece of material, which functions a lot like a star-sized atom.  Except this atom is held together entirely by gravity, rather than the strong force.\n\nAdd yet more mass and there's nothing left to hold it up.  Gravity demands everything fall in, so fall in everything does.  Nuclear forces can't prevent all the stuff in a star from deciding to all occupy the same approximate point.

But the key principle of aircraft is this: at low AoAs, not only does the wing push downward on the air below it like a fan blade, it also *pulls* downward on the air above it.  You get a whole lot of lift, even though your drag is very low.  So your smaller, lighter motor gets almost as much lift as the bigger, heavier one, and your aircraft is thus strong and light enough to lift itself off the ground.", "id": "damp5al"}, {"comment": "So if I change the blades of a table fan, will it fly?", "id": "damq7np"}, {"comment": "that would depend on its fan's thrust to fan weight ratio.

However let's say for a momment that it were higher and you want to lift your table. With that imaginary fan you can fly 3kg(the fan's weight) + 1 extra kg which is the load that it can carry which will make that ratio reaching 1.

Pseudorandom numbers work perfectly well in any application I've encountered.\n\nMy understanding is that there are essentially 3 kinds of randomness:  pseudorandomness, true randomness, and statistical randomness; the latter is purely a statement about the properties of datasets and not about whether nature has truly random aspects or not.  Both well-made pseudorandom generators and true randomness can/will yield datasets that are (measurably) statistically random -- so in that sense they are fully equivalent, no doubt why pseudorandom number generators are used just fine in so many applications. :)\n\nI believe that the matter of whether nature has true randomness as a feature underlying it is still an unsettled question dependent on which interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, though it is universally agreed upon that many uncontrollable aspects of nature when measured yield statistically random datasets, including e.g. radioactive decay, and various examples of symmetry breaking in physical systems.\n\nDue to the physical design of most pseudorandom generators, there's no such artificial generator that is perfect in the sense that its design cannot under any situations be exploited to controllably produce datasets that are not statistically random.  For example most pseudorandom number generators used in ordinary computer applications are seeded by the clock time and/or other sources of information entropy like user input, network input, etc.  All of these variables can in principle be controlled to make the generator produce the same dataset over and over, or produce specific numbers, etc.\n\nSo we have invented devices that use the chaos that seems inherent in nature to provide an unlimited source of entropy for a pseudorandom number generator.  One popular example is [random.org](https://www.random.org/) which generates statistically random numbers from atmospheric noise.  I've heard of other ones that do it from things like the static signals of radio antennae, a proposed one for being based on the measured position of an electron in a hydrogen atom, and such.  Since these natural effects are already statistically random and there is no known way to control such small-scale chaotic or quantum effects even in principle, if these effects *aren't* truly random then at least they cannot be exploited by a malicious actor and can be better-relied on for the most mission-critical applications (e.g. certain defense-, communication- and banking-related applications where exploits could have potentially grave consequences for many people).\n\nHope you find that interesting!", "id": "daq041p"}, {"comment": "Entropy is a measurement of how random data is (in the computer world; I'm not discussing thermodynamics here :).

As an example, you can use your near-true-random data to continually reseed a pseudo random number generator, giving you a \"slow\" pool of highly random bits and a \"fast\" pool of pseudo-random bits that are *almost* true random because the seed is changed so often and the seed is random.

Huge fan of your work (loved the Obama interview, and your channel generally)\n\nBasically - the **short answer** is it the charge will eventually get to the ground, but bolts can only be a certain size, and will have a certain direction.\n\nThe **longer answer** I've broken into parts:\n\n a) What are the bolts? The bolts are caused due to something called air discharge. The Tesla coil is acting like a capacitor that is discharging.\n\nb) Why do the bolts go in a certain direction? The coil has a point sticking out of it (which is shaped like the end of a pin, but acts like end of a gun), and this causes charge to build up and current to come out of this point. Like charges repel and the most stable surfaces for charge build up are things like domes that are nice and smooth and allow like charges to spread out. The pointy end causes electric current to go out at that end and crucially with a *certain direction*, roughly along with the line of the point. With the gun this is *parallel to* the ground rather than at it, so it will start off going in this direction\n\nc) Why is the bolt of a certain length? Electricity can only travel over air a certain distance with given conditions, and this is known as the \"spark gap\". Paschen's law gives the conditions for current to flow in air, and essentially with the condition described with a Tesla Coil the greater the voltage the greater the distance. But crucially this distance is *limited*, it is not infinite, and so there is a limit to how far the current can go as a bolt.\n\nd) What happens to the electrons then? The electric current appears to have a definite length, but we may naturally ask what happens to the electrons. The electrons don't disappear, but they do interact with gases in the air. They likely ionize atoms in air positively by knocking off electrons or they get captured by atoms forming negative ions. These ionized atoms will continue to obey the same laws of EM the rest of the universe does, and will be attracted to like charges, and some, in fact probably the majority would end up in the ground.\n\nSo one could argue that the current *does* eventually meet the ground.\n\nHope this is useful, and I'm sure people will correct errors of mine. \n\nIf this is helpful, I have a small request.\n", "id": "danx95s"}, {"comment": "Does ionization have to occur in order for the electrons to flow?\n\nYes that was helpful, but I will manage your expectations by saying I probably cannot agree to your request for several reasons.

My apologies.", "id": "danxjc2"}, {"comment": ">Does ionization have to occur in order for the electrons to flow?\n\nYes and no. Electrons can flow in a vacuum - for example the solar wind consists partly of electrons (among many other charged particles). \n\nBut for a *lighting-style bolt* of the type under discussion here, then yes we do need to have ionization. This is because ionization creates a small plasma which allows charge to move more freely  - it is more conductive - and thus it allows more electrons to flow. And it is the electron flow through the ionized plasma that creates the light. There's further discussion of air ionization [here](http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/natural-disasters/lightning2.htm).\n\nMy request was literally going to be to say \"Hey to Mike\" and any other people who helped answer questions at the end of your next video.

It would probably just melt a part of the coil even if you made one specifically for vacuum.\n\nHowever there is something similar to what you're asking about- an electron gun.  The most important part of an electron gun is something you've almost certainly seen every day of your life- an incandescent lightbulb.  Its necessary to heat up electrons to a very high temperature to be able to peel them off anything.  They need to be bouncing around as far as possible from the atoms they belong to.  Right next to the filament there is a series of metal plates charged to very high positive voltages, each with a hole in the middle.  Every once in a while, an electron will be sucked off the filament, and juuust miss each of the plates, shooting out through the holes in each of them.  It's a one in ten thousand kinda thing.\n\nThe electrons from an electron gun are usually a few kV, thousands of volts, but can be several tens of kV.

It was great to watch how much fun you were having during that video.\n\nOn the safety bit, part of the reason the answers vary so much are because each answer depends on a lot of things.

The level of resistance offered to the current path with unbroken skin is much higher than if you have an open wound where it starts to drop to basically the same level of resistance that water would offer.  And when dealing with super high voltage, as it is ionizing things near its path, the resistance also changes.

For instance, your skin is acting as a resistor to keep the current low, but the high voltages could ionize the air around the path enough to find a cut or abrasion that offers very low resistance to another fork of energy and now the current is suddenly magnitudes higher.  If you watch super high speed footage of lightning you can see it is branching and looking for the lowest resistance path to ground and when it finally connects is when you get the large flash and boom.\n\nIn this case your demonstrator had current limiters installed that keep things very low so as not to worry.

The branches happen because there isn't enough charge separation along the current branch for it to keep up current flow so it finds another path of ionization to flow current along.  The branches are \"random\" in as much as we cannot predict how the ionization will occur, but it is much more likely to happen at some areas such as points on conductors (lightning rods).\n\nThat's my attempt at explaining it somewhat coherently.  Hopefully some other folks will chime in to clarify or correct me as needed.  The best way I find to explain it is to think of lightning branches and look at high speed footage of lightning strikes.

You only need to halve the speed of a sound 10 times to push the highest discernible frequency (20kHz for someone with excellent hearing) to below the lowest discernible frequency (20Hz). \n\nThe how: For the sound of this video I cross-synthesized ice cracks with recordings of actual electricity using the (very very expensive :P) FLUX cross-synthesis plugin from a French company called IRCAM.

What TCP does is continually try to send more data. When the maximum is reached and the network is full a loss event will occur. When it does TCP will cut the amount of data it is trying to send, typically it will cut down to nothing and increase exponentially, or it will cut in half and increase linearly. This will continually happen and so the speed will always fluctuate."], [781, "There are many factors that come into play in internet connections, almost too many. The fact is, we have been studying the internet as long as it existed, and there are multiple papers published every year on traffic statistics, models, case studies on specific use cases, new protocols and protocol enhancements, census data, performance analyses, client characteristics, etc. Since our networks constantly change, their behaviour also does so. Characteristics of traffic of DSL users today may not be the same in 5-10 years, and has changed a lot in the last 10-15.\n\nGiven the question is so broad, there is a lot of things to be said, so I'll stick with the most well-established ones.\n\n1. Typical DSL clients' web traffic has a few interesting characteristics:\n * your upstream bandwidth limits your downstream throughput [Charzinski, 2000](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/45bb/4eda79f40960749ba4dd7386ffa661de965f.pdf)\n * for some ISPs, there is an observed drop in performance early in the morning and late in the evening, performance variability increases for _all_ ISPs during peak hours [Sundaresan et al, 2011](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2011/papers/sigcomm/p134.pdf)\n * the _last-mile latency_ and jitter are lower than upstream, and losses are usually bursty - if you lose one packet, it's more likely you'll lose the next one, too\n * excessive buffering tends to increase latency, just like insufficient buffering, but tends to increase jitter, contrary to insufficient buffering (a phenomenon aka \"bufferbloat\")\n * there is no single best ISP for everyone\n\n2. The principal someone behind the \"randomness\", or to put it differently the exhibited negative impact, is _self-similarity_. Self-similarity is the property of a time series (in this case) to exhibit the same characteristics in varying scales. As a result, these series exhibit bursty behaviour at a wide variety of scale. Surprisingly, this was shown for Ethernet as far back as 1995 by [Leland et al](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-leland.pdf), and [Crovella & Bestavros](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~crovella/paper-archive/self-sim/journal-version.pdf) showed its adverse effects on HTTP traffic.\n\nI will stop here, as I realise I've spent about an hour trying to summarise this stuff in my head and only typed a handful about it, and I've left out huge amounts of literature on wireless & mobile networks, medium differences, caching, and network churn. If you have any specific questions ask away and I'll do my best to answer or at least point you to relevant literature."], [243, "[removed]"], [101, "There are going to be many factors involved. The main ones are going to be the medium the signal is travelling through, the route and network congestion.\nSay you want to watch a Youtube video and the video wont load fast enough. Lets first assume your internet bandwidth is more than capable of handling the data. \nThe location of that video could be  on the other side of the world. When a request comes from your computer to view that video it starts a complicated series of events. ***Very simplified version - An electrical signal from router to the ISP, the ISP to their other routers, those routers to other ISP routers, then to undersea cables, then to international ISP, then through their network, then through to other networks they have data agreements with then finally to the server that is hosting the video. And thats just to start the process. To watch the entire Youtube video this process must take place in a back and forth motion at the speed of light until the data has been received. \nThe cable you just used to watch that video could be 1000's of miles long. It could pass through Turkey who currently has a fibre break and are re-routing the traffic causing congestion. It could may have rained somewhere along those 1000's of miles and caused one of the pits to fill with water (a pit is a junction where the street cables meet), there could be a ship's anchor that has just cut the undersea cable, there could be a foreign submarine tapping that undersea cable causing the electrical signal to weaken etc. etc. etc. As you could imagine there virtually an unlimited number of things that can go wrong. Another big one which doesnt get much mention is human error. A lot of slowness of your internet could be caused by somebody within your ISP pressing the wrong button on the keyboard. Oops somebody within your ISP just tried to migrate a bunch of services to a shinny new piece of hardware and it didnt work out. Trust me, that happens all the time.\n"], [50, "I think you mean rates, not speeds. The speed is the near the speed of light, but a rate is the quantity of data you can receive or send over a specific time period. \n\nIn order for data to travel over the internet it needs to be broken up into predictable chunks, and labeled for delivery. This is a poor analogy, but think of the previous sentence like this: \n\n[In order] - 1/15 destination reddit.com\n\n[ for dat] - 2/15 destination reddit.com\n\n[a to tra] - 3/15 destination reddit.com\n\n[vel over] - 4/15 destination reddit.com\n\n[ the inte] - 5/15  destination reddit.com\n\n[rnet it ] - 6/15  destination reddit.com\n\n... and so on.\n\nAll those packages have the same destination address, but the internet doesn't care which delivery company you use to get them there, which map service they use to look up the reddit.com address, or which roads the trucks that take them there use. Much like any delivery service, there are a lot of variables in how things get done. \n\nIs there a speed limit in Omaha?  - This would be analogous to throttling or 'rate' limiting. \n\nIs there a traffic jam near Chicago?  - This could be a distributed denial of service attack forcing our driver to drive all the way down to Texas to avoid it because nothing is going through Chicago? \n\nAre the roads just crappy in Pennsylvania? Yes they are. This could cause your driver to need to driver slower than previously anticipated. \n\nDid the driver lose his map?  (bad DNS service) - He might need to spend way longer trying to find out where he is going than you anticipated. \n\nAnd then, once the package get's all the way to your building, maybe the mail room sucks and the delivery guy sits in line for half an hour waiting for someone to sign that they got it (server issues). \n\nLet's say FedEx doesn't deliver to Miami, so it passes one or all of the packages off to another delivery service for delivery. It doesn't have control over how they work, so it could be better or worse service, but at least the package gets there. \n\nI *think* what you're asking is why would internet have *consistently* slower rates for all sites and services when plugged into ethernet, and your answer in that case would almost always be this last one. Your local provider is over capacity or just sucks. \n\nHowever, that answer varies if you're talking about a single website, or single computer experiencing this on your local network, or any number of other variables."], [15, "this is a good starting point: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion\n\ncongestion is probably the leading cause of the 'randomness' of network speeds. others have brought it up but didn't really explain it too well.\n\nnetwork hardware has limitations just like any other hardware; there's only a certain amount of traffic it can handle.\n\nthink of it like a funnel. you are capable of producing liquid at a rate of a liter per second. the funnel may be able to handle 10 liters per second. if you're the only one using it, sweet, everything works great. but then 10 other people also start using the funnel at a liter per second. now the funnel is trying to handle 11 liters per second and things start backing up.\n\nthis is the basic idea behind distributed denial of service attacks. you have a bunch of connections that can produce liquid at a certain rate and you get enough of them to send everything at a single funnel until it gets backed up and eventually fails."], [8, "On the ISP side, utilization rates are making a comeback.

I work in management for a cable company. It doesn't happen too often (maybe once every couple of months), but when it does....it's catastrophic. "], [7, "Congestion!!!!\n\nISPs over subscribe customers to any particular pipe all the time. \n\nlets say your apt building has 40 apartments and the handoff to your apartment building is only a 1 gig port. Your ISP wants to charge insane amounts of money to customers so they are willing to offer you bandwidth speeds that are so great that you likely will never hit the max thresh hold. So you pay $100+ for 100Mbs and boast to your friends about the alpha speeds you're getting. But realistically you wont even come close to using even 1/3 of the bandwidth at a given time. You're only 1 apartment out of the 40 in your building. Others are doing the same thing. Some are getting 75Mbs, some 50 or 25Mbs. Maybe that 1000Mbs port is maxed out at 20 apartments but when all 20 are using the internet during peak usage times, the collective nternet usage of all 20 customers  on the 1Gig/1000Mbs port is only 30-50%. Isp's could at this point drop another access port at your building to provide bandwidth for the remaining 20 apartments who still are with out internet or they could just see that the existing sold out circuit of 1000Mbs has never passed 50% utilization mark. So they end up selling the already sold bandwidth to the rest of building. It's only when everyone is on at the same time and they are accessing bandwidth heavy content is when that 1000Mbs pipe starts to get congested. \n\nLook at it this way... Suppose the entrance to your apartment building has a  a door that can allow 10 people to walk through it when standing shoulder to shoulder. But at most only 3-4 people ever walk out together, now imagine 40 people wanting to walk out of the building at the same time. The bottleneck of 10 people will keep everyone from walking out at the same time. This is what congestion is. Some people will get out ok, others will have to wait a few seconds before they can get out and even when they succeed to get out, they'd be squeezed in with others trying to pass through that door thus slowing them down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "], [4, "For a really technical explanation:\n\n* [The Chaotic Nature of TCP Congestion Control](http://rubinet.ece.ucdavis.edu/people/chuah/classes/eec274/eec274-w13/refs/00VB-chaoticTCP.pdf)\n* [On the Self-Similar Nature of Ethernet Traffic](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-leland.pdf)"], [4, "Nobody really answered OP's question, just a lot of responses about ISPs, congestion, QoS, etc. \n\n\nLet's say we have an internet of two computers, connected by Ethernet through a router or switch, and they communicate with each other and nothing else.

There are issues that occur with large scale networks just like any other large network. They are all predictable and explainable, but not random."], [3, "Depending on what you use, it's a combination of all of the following, to a more or lesser degree:\n\n* All data transmission, on its lowest level, is subject to a degree of random noise and related degradation. The world is analog. Most transmission schemes use retransmission of data and alterating the data rate in-the-fly to keep the link stable under varying noise conditions.\n\n* A lot of communication protocols have inherent randomness (e.g. to prevent collisions when 2 users are on the same channel) and/or speed fluctuation (TCP sliding window etc...)\n\n* As soon as multiple users share one medium/datapipe, it needs to be multiplexed. This multiplexing is always rather coarse (never 1 bit at a time, usually 1 packet (64bytes-1500bytes) at a time.\n\n*  Both client and server perform most tasks sequentially. This is related to the aforementioned multiplexing, but on a system level. For example if your Ethernet controller tells your CPU \"feed me data\", it might respond immediately, or take a little longer because the CPU was doing some other high prior task."], [3, "Because the whole system that gets data from your computer to a server and back again is so complex, there are many many opportunities for small things to affect your speed in unpredictable ways. Alone, most of these things are not random (an exception would be a cosmic ray hitting a router and causing it to drop one of your packets!) but the outcome is chaos.\n\nAlong the perhaps a dozen links between you and a website, there might be one which is experiencing abnormally high load due to maintenance running on one of the routers which consumes a lot of its processing power. This will cause it to drop some of your packets, which means your connection gets slower. This is not random; the maintenance may even have been planned, but you can't see it happening and it is compounded by a thousand other effects like weather, physical damage, heat, normal load from other users and so on. To the end user, it looks random.\n\nHowever, a good-quality internet connection should not look *that* random, because generally most places that experience these variations have more capacity than your link between your computer and your ISP. That means that if a single routing point is facing abnormally high load, it will only reduce your speed by a tiny amount. If your speed varies hugely, it means something is wrong."], [3, "One good way to prevent this randomness in your home network is QoS, or Quality of Service. It's a method where the router/switch you're using will limit the speed to something just below your maximum capabilities so that there's more room for TCP overhead (the metadata of the actual transmission). This way everything gets a steady stable speed and there's room for the network to keep communicating with each other over the data streams.\n"], [2, "Internet speeds are random because of the structure of the internet. When you connect to something on the internet it could be millions of miles away. Your information must travel through hundreds of different routers/switches/Internet service providers (ISP). If any one of these ISPs have any sort of congestion then your overall speed is affected. Just like how traveling during the Holidays has a higher chance of taking longer because of the amount of traffic, the internet works the same way. During times where more people are using the internet, the higher the chance for some slow downs to occur.\n\nThere are also additional factors such as the technology your local ISP is using. I can go more in-depth of the impacts of your local ISP if anyone would like me to.\n"], [2, "I currently work at a major Internet providers call center!

When it's 5 pm and everyone is online, your connection suffers. It is highly dependant on whether or not the whole neighborhood is online. \nIf you're running your Internet through a DSL service, then you have a direct line, and no one else has access, because you've got your own separate connection. If you have a DSL service, and are still getting inconsistent speed, then you're dealing with a technical issue, like the top comment mentioned. It's due to the fact that it's not having a constant stream of data coming to you at once. Most companies, if not all, have very little effect on this, and it's mostly due to the infrastructure used. \n\nSource: Work for a major Internet provider. "], [3, "Number one reason is peak period load. Basically the more people using the Internet at one point in time in one area means it will be bogged down in that area. Most people do similar things at similar times therfore it bogs down the local infrastructure. There are many other factors but this is literally 95% of the reason. Sure packet loss and large outages account for some rerouting issues, but it is mostly just over use of local infrastructure.\n\nFor example when you look at your contract for your cable Internet you will see \"speeds up to to 100mps!!!!\". In the fine print it will say \"speeds of 5mbps guaranteed.... shhhhhh\". This is because you may have one local blade servicing 200 homes with a max of 5000mps. For the most part you will be able to serve all the homes 100mps, but at 7pm when every home has 3+ people streaming video, playing games, and downloading files you will start to see bottlenecks."], [3, "An internet connection isn't just your connection.  Sure you have a pipe to your ISP's neighborhood box, but from there everyone on the ISP uses the same \"pipe\" to connect out to the world. And then it flows out on even more shared \"pipes\"  to it's intended destination and then when communication is sent back it flows back on shared pipes once again.   \n\nThe internet uses something called \"packet switching\"  where all the links/lines (copper, fiber, RF, etc.) are always on and data from all sources and destinations are broken up into pieces (packets and frames) and sent in pieces shuffled together almost like playing cards to share these links.  The system was invented to replace the circuit based phone system during the cold war in an effort to ensure command and control of military/government assets.  If parts of the phone/communication system were to be destroyed.   Phone, fax, and etc. connections were built as a electrical circuit. When the pentagon keep an open circuit to a command center in another region of the country, if a city/exchange it passes through got nuked the circuit would be b roken and it could take minutes or hours to rebuild the circuit around the damage to restore communication.   If you can break down the communication into digital packets and send it out on a packet switched network, the switching and routing protocols automatically find routes for the data if the previous best path becomes unavailable.  Ensuring messages could reach their destinations.\n\nAs this government network evolved (arpanet/csnet/nsfnet) it became evident that it could be opened to the general public, Al Gore wrote the [High Performance Computing Act of 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_Computing_Act_of_1991) creating the public internet we have today. Now instead of ensuring nuclear missiles can be launched after an attack, it is used to view porn and order pizza.  Periods of high traffic can be predicted as humans are creatures of habit.

Download speeds are uneven?), there are several possible reasons:\n\n* Not every server has the total available resources for you at anytime, which means that they may not be able to serve you at your full last mile speed, for example, if a site has a lots of visitors, the resources (bandwidth, CPU, memory and so on), may be at capacity, thus it appears slow to you.    \nThe same can be said when you're downloading something from a server which has a lot of usage. \n\n* There may be congestion on the network (from the server to you, at any point, including your ISP/lastmile network), so packets take longer to reach the you or are lost in transit, so they either retransmission is needed, congestion control kicks in (part of TCP) \n\n* Your computer may be overwhelmed, so it reduces the window size (flow control). \n\n* Traffic Shaping policies by the part of your ISP. \n\n"], [2, "All the other answers are correct, but here's the simplest way it can be put: Upstream traffic!

Some people have already described some issues with tcp.\n\nI'll go a little more low level here. \n\nSo you have the operating system kernel (think of this as a piece of software which allows all of the components of your computer to communicate).\n\nThere's also CPU cache, think of this as extremely fast memory that is very limited (high end cpus these days will only have about 40mb). To give you a sense of, it will take 1 clock cycle to access something in level 1 cache whereas it could take up to 100 clock cycles to access something in main memory. \n\nIf you're running a basic setup, your system is likely experiencing a context switch on each packet received. This is basically when your CPU switches between two process, it will move the existing state from cache over to main and then fetch the state from the other process in main, then store in cache. This may also happen as a result of another process that needs to do something on that same core. \n\nThe kernel will also move around your process across different cores depending on what it sees fit. Further, if you are on a multi-socket (more than 1 CPU) machine - the kernel may move across physical cpus. All of this will create overhead. \n\nYou may also be running a blocking process, this is when everything is halted until some event happens (packet receive in this case). \n\nAgain assuming a basic setup, whenever a packet hits your network card, the packet is copied by your kernel and then put into main memory.\n\nSome things you can do to increase speed and reduce \"randomness\":\n\nRun a non-blocking process, pin the process to a specific core, give the process higher priority, move different flows to specific cores/queues, use zero copy if your card supports it. \n\nWith all of that you can probably take the standard deviation of your latency into single digit microseconds."], [2, "The simpler answer has to do with traffic.  Not unlike automobile traffic, some routes to/from certain places (websites) have more or less traffic but only a finite amount of bandwidth to provide it over.

If i'm typing in an SSH connection then there's some randomness from the rate at which I type.\n\nThirdly, there's latencies that come in from the network itself - the ethernet switch is not perfect and if it's busy there will be increased latency (yes, even on switches - if there's 1 CPU handling the switching of frames, that CPU has nondeterministic responses because we don't know ahead of time what inputs it's going to get).\n\nThis is all before you even hit your router and the internet - to get to the internet there's the transmission medium connecting your home or workplace to your ISP and random stray EM fields that may make packet retransmissions required or that may temporarily lower the bandwidth available depending on the type of link.\n\nOnce inside your ISP network, we have all the same issues as your LAN but multiplied due to the 1000s of extra users so there's even more randomness introduced here.\n\nThen there's an element of randomness introduced at each router hop to the destination because of other traffic and then at the destination itself the server may be busy or less busy from moment to moment as well as the server's network.\n\nOn the way back to you, packets from the server may take totally different routes depending on the hops inbetween your ISP and the server's ISP and all the same randomness comes into play again.\n\nPut simply: every step of the process has some element of randomness and it all adds up so that moment to moment your throughput as seen at the application layer will always have some variance. The more steps involved, the greater the variance.\n\nTo some degree, QoS implementations can reduce this variance - but it's physically impossible to eliminate it completely. Even factors like the physical movement of harddrive heads and random stray EM fields effect the overall data rates."], [2, "It all depends on which side youre seeing the bottleneck, unfotunately now days there are so many variables in determining internet speed that it makes it very hard to find out.\n\nFrom the source you have the actual file you are accessing - Is it hosted on a link faster than you can consume? And what is the latency from you to this node? Then you have links and routing, how does your client get to the destination? do you have to traverse the pacific ocean to get this file? Then you have ISP issues, there are usually many ISP's involved here, there is sometimes a wholesale ISP then the retail ISP, so the problem could be anywhere with those guys.....THEN they have to get the data from the ISP to your phone/fibre/coax point in your house....what step downs and media converters are required here? Are you on DSL with a max of 20mbps? if so, all of the ISP infrastructure would have to be PERFECT and lossless to get you that speed, as well as you being close to the telco exchange.\n\nTHEN last of all, a huge number of people have wireless in their homes, wireless, bar none, is the lossiest way of transmitting lots of data, it will increase latency to the destination by at least a few ms.... \n\nSo after saying all that, the reason for random speeds even over ethernet could be any number of the things i mentioned earlier, all it takes is one of those things to not work well and bam... slow speed."], [2, "There are little trolls that carry your internet through those pipes they put in the ground.

Note that this is not Speedtest.net, this is something else, which actually measures congestion/bufferbloat. Prevent congestion and bufferbloat by enabling a Smart Queuing algorithm such as FQ-CoDel on your network middleboxes. CoDel is available in most Linux aftermarket router firmware distros such as DD-WRT and OpenWrt, but it probably isn't enabled by default. Enable ECN on your middleboxes and endpoints to help deal with congestion without having to actually drop packets. Employ Google's BBR (their new TCP congestion control algorithm) on all your TCP endpoints.\n\n**Long answer:**\n\nWhen RAM became cheap, switch and router manufacturers thought they wanted to never drop a packet even during congestion, so they added more buffering (queueing). But if you buffer a bunch of frames and your queue never drains, all your queue does is add latency (lag) to the connection. This sucks for live two-way A/V, gaming, etc.  This added lag caused by huge buffer queues that never drain is a bug known as \"bufferbloat\".\n\nSo you really want to allow TCP's Congestion Control algorithms to work, so that the TCP senders back off when there's congestion, so that the congestion goes away. Most TCP congestion control algorithms look for dropped frames as a sign of congestion. So you really do want to drop frames when there's congestion, rather than add too much latency. You just want to be really smart about when to drop frames and which ones to drop. The worst approach is the traditional naive approach known as \"FIFO with tail drop\". Later came the \"Automatic Queue Management\" algorithms like RED, WRED, and BLUE, but they weren't smart enough about latency, and have too many knobs to adjust. The newest generation of network scheduling algorithms that are bufferbloat-aware call themselves \"Smart Queueing\" algorithms. The most notable of which is \"FQ-CoDel\" (Flow Queue Controlled Delay).\n\nOnce you've got a Smart Queueing algorithm such as CoDel enabled on your network middleboxes (switches, routers, APs, gateways, modems, DSLAMs, CMTSes, etc.), if you'd really rather not drop packets but still allow TCP to know about congestion so its congestion control algorithms can work, then you could enable Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) on your middleboxes and endpoints. ECN is a way for middleboxes to signal congestion to endpoints without dropping packets.\n\nBecause folks creating TCP endpoints are tired of waiting for all the middleboxes to deploy bufferbloat-aware Smart Queueing algorithms like CoDel, they're taking matters into their own hands and creating a new generation of congestion control algorithms that measure latency increases (bufferbloat) and use that as a sign of congestion. Basically, they try to maximize throughput while simultaneously minimizing latency. Google's BBR and MIT's Sprout are examples of this kind of work. So deploy BBR on all your endpoints while you're at it.", "id": "dak7hlb"}, {"comment": "I don't know who you are, but because of you I no longer need to track reddit. :) The only thing wrong with your summary above is that you often need to take control of the buffering on your smart queue device first via a shaper like htb.

The clients' TCP stack detects packet loss and backs off (the window size) exponentially; this causes under-utilisation of the link(s). TCP's behaviour is to reach maximum utilisation by constantly increasing the window size. Because all clients exhibit the same behaviour, the results of this process on traffic are amplified by the number of clients. Therefore we have a large number of clients competing for the link in a uniform way, constantly trying to increase their utilisation by sending more segments to our router.

The algorithm was not designed to run on switch backplanes with the massive input queues that we see today.  From the wikipedia article on buffer bloat:\n\n> Packets are queued within a network buffer before being transmitted; in problematic situations, packets are dropped only if the buffer is full. On older routers, buffers were fairly small so they filled quickly and therefore packets began to drop shortly after the link became saturated, so the TCP protocol could adjust and the issue would not become apparent. On newer routers, buffers have become large enough to hold several megabytes of data, which translates to time amounts in seconds required for emptying the buffers. This causes the TCP algorithm that shares bandwidth on a link to react very slowly as its behavior depends on actually having packets dropped when the transmission channel becomes saturated.", "id": "dajelde"}, {"comment": "And with the more secure stuff, encryption handshaking and resyncing once disconnected complicates things as well.", "id": "daj9mid"}, {"comment": "Why would any of that mess up from a dropped packet or two?", "id": "dajh7dh"}, {"comment": "Detecting congestion earlier than at packet loss is theoretically a much better solution.

We explain to him: \"You know that TCP only scales back when packets are dropped?\". \"Sure, but some other router will drop the packets, we can't do it, we're getting devastated in reviews.\"\n\nAnd that's how the bufferbloat arms race goes on. No router wants to be the one to drop packets because people on the internet can only think one thought at a time and only measure one measure at a time.\n\nPacket drop is *ESSENTIAL* for TCP to function correctly (mostly because there are firewalls out there that destroy TCP packets with the ECN option despite having 15 years to learn about it and currently ECN is still disabled on everything by default (except maybe iOS who said a year ago they would enable ECN by default)). Today, you end up with routers that have their buffers filled with resends of the same packets over and over and over again just because there was a hiccup somewhere on the network for a millisecond and that filled up everyones semi-infinite buffers. Buffers that only exist because \"some other router will drop the packets\".\n\nWant to increase the throughput of your network? Shrink the buffers everywhere so that you end up at a healthy small packet loss rate. Then you'll be going at pretty much full speed all the time and you'll have sub-millisecond latencies for pretty much all signalling you need.

The fact is, we have been studying the internet as long as it existed, and there are multiple papers published every year on traffic statistics, models, case studies on specific use cases, new protocols and protocol enhancements, census data, performance analyses, client characteristics, etc. Since our networks constantly change, their behaviour also does so. Characteristics of traffic of DSL users today may not be the same in 5-10 years, and has changed a lot in the last 10-15.\n\nGiven the question is so broad, there is a lot of things to be said, so I'll stick with the most well-established ones.\n\n1. Typical DSL clients' web traffic has a few interesting characteristics:\n * your upstream bandwidth limits your downstream throughput [Charzinski, 2000](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/45bb/4eda79f40960749ba4dd7386ffa661de965f.pdf)\n * for some ISPs, there is an observed drop in performance early in the morning and late in the evening, performance variability increases for _all_ ISPs during peak hours [Sundaresan et al, 2011](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2011/papers/sigcomm/p134.pdf)\n * the _last-mile latency_ and jitter are lower than upstream, and losses are usually bursty - if you lose one packet, it's more likely you'll lose the next one, too\n * excessive buffering tends to increase latency, just like insufficient buffering, but tends to increase jitter, contrary to insufficient buffering (a phenomenon aka \"bufferbloat\")\n * there is no single best ISP for everyone\n\n2. The principal someone behind the \"randomness\", or to put it differently the exhibited negative impact, is _self-similarity_. Self-similarity is the property of a time series (in this case) to exhibit the same characteristics in varying scales. As a result, these series exhibit bursty behaviour at a wide variety of scale. Surprisingly, this was shown for Ethernet as far back as 1995 by [Leland et al](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/archive/1995/jan95/ccr-9501-leland.pdf), and [Crovella & Bestavros](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~crovella/paper-archive/self-sim/journal-version.pdf) showed its adverse effects on HTTP traffic.\n\nI will stop here, as I realise I've spent about an hour trying to summarise this stuff in my head and only typed a handful about it, and I've left out huge amounts of literature on wireless & mobile networks, medium differences, caching, and network churn.

To further the purpose of the question of OP of what causes random internet speeds, your connection goes through many routers to reach its destination. If one link in the chain is weak or broken it will cause slowdowns.\n\nFor example, if I go from northern NJ, to googles DNS server, I have to traverse through 11 different routers to get there. First I go out through my firewall, traverse 4 routers in my ISP, then out to another service which connects the ISPs together, go through 4 more routers, then to the ISP that services googles datacenter, another 3 routers, then we finally reach googles dns server.\n\nThat is the best case scenario, the optimal route for me to take to get maximum speed and the lowest latency. If any of those 11 devices I have to go through are at maximum capacity, or having errors, my connection will be slowed. In a worse scenario, if any of those devices are offline or unreachable I would have to route around that device, which could take much longer depending on where the failure is. If your connection has to be routed around a problem device, it will usually mean everyone else does too, which no only increases the trip time but increases the traffic on the devices handling all the new requests. Its like a detour on the road, it slows down normal traffic on the detour because of the sudden influx of cars going around a problem.\n\nI once was connecting from NY to VA, normally it would be fine to play a game on that VA server but one of the major nodes was down on the normal route.

To give you a sense of, it will take 1 clock cycle to access something in level 1 cache whereas it could take up to 100 clock cycles to access something in main memory. \n\nIf you're running a basic setup, your system is likely experiencing a context switch on each packet received. This is basically when your CPU switches between two process, it will move the existing state from cache over to main and then fetch the state from the other process in main, then store in cache. This may also happen as a result of another process that needs to do something on that same core. \n\nThe kernel will also move around your process across different cores depending on what it sees fit. Further, if you are on a multi-socket (more than 1 CPU) machine - the kernel may move across physical cpus. All of this will create overhead. \n\nYou may also be running a blocking process, this is when everything is halted until some event happens (packet receive in this case). \n\nAgain assuming a basic setup, whenever a packet hits your network card, the packet is copied by your kernel and then put into main memory.\n\nSome things you can do to increase speed and reduce \"randomness\":\n\nRun a non-blocking process, pin the process to a specific core, give the process higher priority, move different flows to specific cores/queues, use zero copy if your card supports it. \n\nWith all of that you can probably take the standard deviation of your latency into single digit microseconds.", "id": "dajmjk8"}], [{"comment": "The simpler answer has to do with traffic.

If i'm typing in an SSH connection then there's some randomness from the rate at which I type.\n\nThirdly, there's latencies that come in from the network itself - the ethernet switch is not perfect and if it's busy there will be increased latency (yes, even on switches - if there's 1 CPU handling the switching of frames, that CPU has nondeterministic responses because we don't know ahead of time what inputs it's going to get).\n\nThis is all before you even hit your router and the internet - to get to the internet there's the transmission medium connecting your home or workplace to your ISP and random stray EM fields that may make packet retransmissions required or that may temporarily lower the bandwidth available depending on the type of link.\n\nOnce inside your ISP network, we have all the same issues as your LAN but multiplied due to the 1000s of extra users so there's even more randomness introduced here.\n\nThen there's an element of randomness introduced at each router hop to the destination because of other traffic and then at the destination itself the server may be busy or less busy from moment to moment as well as the server's network.\n\nOn the way back to you, packets from the server may take totally different routes depending on the hops inbetween your ISP and the server's ISP and all the same randomness comes into play again.\n\nPut simply: every step of the process has some element of randomness and it all adds up so that moment to moment your throughput as seen at the application layer will always have some variance.

Coli cells are able to move up gradients of attractant and down gradients of repellant. E. coli moves in biased random walks through the use of flagella which are capable of turning in two directions, clockwise and counterclockwise. When the flagella are all spinning the same way, the cell moves in a straight line called a \"run\". When one or more of the flagella start to spin the opposite direction, the cell turns around randomly, a process called a \"tumble\", until the flagella start spinning together again and another run starts. These runs and tumbles make up the random walk. The bias comes from the cell signaling pathways that control the direction of rotation of the flagella. When the cell is moving toward a food source, or away from something harmful, the length of the runs is increased and the frequency of tumbling is decreased. To put it briefly, the direction of rotation of the flagellar motor is controlled by the phosphorylation of certain internal molecules, which is controlled by cell surface receptors which bind to external molecules. There are also some feedback loops that allow these signalling pathways to be robust.

For T cells, activation by a professional antigen-presenting cell (APC) by presentation of antigenic peptide in conjunction with an appropriate MHC molecule, as well as costimulatory ligands that stimulate receptors other than the T cell receptor, is more important than cytokine or chemokine signaling in mounting a response; chemokines can be thought of as communicating information about where a threat is and cytokines can be thought of as additional information that tunes the specificity of the response, mainly by dictating the differentiation program of a naive T cell. \n\nIf the threat is a worm, naive CD4+ T cells presented with helminth-derived antigen (that their T cell receptor can recognize) in conjunction with MHC II molecules and the costimulatory ligand B7 will initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the translocation of the transcription factors GATA-3 and STAT6 into the nucleus, where they transcribe, among other things, genes encoding the cytokines IL-13, IL-4, and IL-5, which orchestrate the responses of other immune players that can fight worms (like eosinophils). IL-13 promotes [class-switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_class_switching) in B cells so that they make IgE antibodies, activates basophils, and promotes epithelial cell turnover in the intestine (shedding epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces so that helminths that are attached to them are expelled). It also promotes mucin secretion by goblet cells -- a strategy sometimes referred to as \"weep and sweep\". IL-4 promotes class-switching as well but also blocks IFN-\u03b3 receptors. Altogether, this is called a Th2 biased response (IFN-\u03b3 promotes a Th1 response, which is ineffective against worms but excellent for killing intracellular bacteria and protozoa).\n\nOne fascinating aspect of our co-evolution with worms is that many species make immune modulating chemicals to inhibit Th2 responses and thereby tolerize the host to their presence. Some of these secretory products promote T cell differentiation into T regulatory cells (Tregs), which moderate immune responses. For this reason, many of these products are being investigated for therapeutic potential to treat Crohn's disease, IBD, and other conditions.

"], [7, "Great answer from crnaruka who hit the major points.\n\n\nOne more thing to add about the cost:  A large fraction of the cost of a solar cell is now the \"balance of systems\" costs.  This includes the glass for encapsulating the cell, the metal supports for the panel, the installation costs of the panel, and the supporting circuitry to convert the electricity to the proper type and voltage.\n\n\nThese costs are fairly similar for each technology and are roughly proportional to the cell area.  Therefore, increases in efficiency (more power per area) decreases how much you need to spend on these balance of systems costs.\n\nAnother way to think about this is an example called the \"free wafer\" problem, which goes:\n\n\nIf someone gave you a functioning solar cell device for free, how efficient would it need to be to be cheaper than current solar costs if you still needed to pay all of the balance of systems costs?\n\n\nThe answer depends on your assumptions, but the number I have heard is ~12% efficiency.

Perovskite solar cells can reach these efficiencies, but they have incredibly poor stability as of now."], [2, "Really nice discussion!\nThere was the point of cost and that they are cheap or often proclaimed to be cheap in front of the public or the investors.

There is no magic behind.\nThe cost comes with the material, which often cost up to 2500$/gr for the best performing ones. The problem is, you can't buy some in large-scale! You might not need much (some hundred nm thickness), but just to start up a roll-to-roll machine requires some hundred milliliter with several grams of material in it.\nThe barrier foil and glue are also very(!) expensive and are actually the real cost driver for large-area OPVs.\n\nThe only available commercial OPVs are from www.Heliatek.com and www.Solarte.de (belectric OPV, former Konarka), but they only to business-to-business, so you can't find out the price (even asking them reveals no info) Demo installations exist, look good, but only they know how expensive they are.

Organic solar cells are very lightweight, cheap, semi-transparent ,and flexible. The main applications we intended for portable power (can bring solar cells on trip without extra weight and setup), BIPV (building-integrated photovoltaics) for tinted windows that generate electricity, and for long travels without access to electricity so you can generate enough to power a cell phone. Other benefits include low cost of production, ability to retrofit ink printing equipment for production, ability to charge in less intense sunlight (like indoors), and the ultra portability reduces the weight load of soldiers that carry heavy battery packs.\n\nHigh efficiency rigid solar panels will have better efficiency, but start-up costs of a silicon PV system is much higher than for organic solar cells, and they cannot be moves to a new location easily. \n\nSo these solar cells are for different applications than normal rooftop or utility power generation. Portable, cheap, flexible, versatile. A different niche of the market for solar power.", "id": "dajdrwo"}, {"comment": "This is a good start, but I'll elaborate on a few key missing details. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are supposed to be cheaper if you solution process them in a roll-to-roll process. Imagine an inkjet printer or slot-die coater printing on flexible plastic substrates. To install them, you just roll them out. Silicon PV requires heavy framing, which drives up the install cost (something like 80% install cost vs 20% module cost). OPVs could in principle be put down with a staple gun. In addition, you could do this on a curved surface. Furthermore, OPVs are semitransparent and can be used as window coatings in high-rise office buildings, increasing the potential surfaces to harvest energy.\n\nHowever, all the best lab devices in that chart linked above are made on a spin-coater. This is because lab-sized devices are small and for reasons relating to the morphology of the light-absorbing layer, the films need to dry very quickly and spin-coating is one of the fastest drying solution deposition methods. Going from spin-coater to roll-to-roll process is a major hurdle due to the drying time issue. Some of the best large-area devices made on a printer only get ~ 3% power conversion efficiency.\n\nStability is still a big issue. The best OPVs, even when encapsulated only last a few months. For any building application you need 10-15 years lifetime. There are organics that are photostable over decades. But not all materials in an OPV device are. There are also many interfaces in a solar cell, in addition to the nanoscale morphology in OPVs that can change over time.  \n\nThe materials cost issue is a strange one. The highest performing OPVs use complicated polymers that currently cost ~ $1000/g. They are not industrial-scale friendly. That being said, the active layer of OPVs is ~ 100 nm, so each square meter would only have 1 mg ($1) of material. There are many OPV materials that cost ~ $1/g, but get half the efficiency (at 1/1000th the price!). Silicon is expensive because it needs to very pure (99.999% pure). Si PV also has much thicker active layers (~ 200-500 um). Taking into account the density, you need about 1000x more Si than organic by weight. \n\nThe bottom line is OPVs is not a mature technology and will probably need 5 more years of development before all these issues are worked out.", "id": "dajf3st"}, {"comment": "They said it would take 2 years back in 2008 so I wouldn't hold my breath. The barrier layer of the plastic-encased OPV cells needs significant improvement before the cells can be more durable.

There is no magic behind.\nThe cost comes with the material, which often cost up to 2500$/gr for the best performing ones. The problem is, you can't buy some in large-scale! You might not need much (some hundred nm thickness), but just to start up a roll-to-roll machine requires some hundred milliliter with several grams of material in it.\nThe barrier foil and glue are also very(!) expensive and are actually the real cost driver for large-area OPVs.\n\nThe only available commercial OPVs are from www.Heliatek.com and www.Solarte.de (belectric OPV, former Konarka), but they only to business-to-business, so you can't find out the price (even asking them reveals no info) Demo installations exist, look good, but only they know how expensive they are.

The first is the chance of failure during launch.  Unlike most other forms of transport, when a rocket fails, the results are usually catastrophic.  The possibility of scattering nuclear waste across the landscape is just too risky.\n\nThe other one is mass.  Nuclear fuel, and by virtue, nuclear waste, is generally very *heavy*.  The amount of fuel used in reactors is generally classified, but the estimated amount of waste generated by a typical power plant is 20 metric tons per year [1].  Power plants are typically refueled every 18 to 24 months [2].  This means we're looking at a 30 to 40 ton bare payload.  We're already in super-heavy launch vehicle territory, and we haven't even added the actual vehicle that would carry the waste.\n\nHowever, this would only launch the waste to LEO.  This is very dangerous, because the orbit will likely eventually degrade, and the waste will one day fall back to Earth in some random location along its orbital plane.  Not good.\n\nSo we need to launch into an escape velocity.  This requires much more dV, and thus a much larger rocket.\n\nYou could, of course, break up the spent fuel between multiple launches, but this means you're spending more time handling nuclear waste.\n\nAnd *none* of this takes into account the order of magnitude more non-fuel nuclear waste generated.  We still have to take care of *that* waste.\n\nFinally, that nuclear waste might not be worth anything today, but it's entirely possible that it could be reprocessed into usable fuel and other useful products.  This is especially true of the waste being generated right now.  We almost certainly won't be able to dig up and launch long-since buried waste, so we'll only be launching the most potentially useful waste into space.\n\n* [1] http://www.nei.org/Knowledge-Center/Nuclear-Statistics/On-Site-Storage-of-Nuclear-Waste\n* [2] http://neinuclearnotes.blogspot.com/2012/05/what-happens-during-refueling-outage.html\n "], [3, "Cost is the big factor.

RP1/Lox (used in the first stage of Saturn V and in most Russian launchers) releases a lot of CO*_2_* contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Solid fuels like APCP (used in first stage boosters) emit not only CO*_2_* but also hydrogen chloride, which may produce hydrochloric acid when in contact with humidity in the air. Liquid hydrogen/oxygen (normally used in upper stages) releases just water vapor, but it requires energy to be produced - if it's nuclear it's fine, but if it's obtained from fossil fuels then it's also emitting greenhouse gases indirectly.\n\nSo in the end you're changing one type of pollution for another type.\n\nLaunch failures have already been mentioned, but I'd like to add that [there are regulations in place](http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r068.htm), and the payload has to be prepared to fall into any area, even under water, and be prepared to receive water leaking in.

The first is the chance of failure during launch.  Unlike most other forms of transport, when a rocket fails, the results are usually catastrophic.  The possibility of scattering nuclear waste across the landscape is just too risky.\n\nThe other one is mass.  Nuclear fuel, and by virtue, nuclear waste, is generally very *heavy*.  The amount of fuel used in reactors is generally classified, but the estimated amount of waste generated by a typical power plant is 20 metric tons per year [1].  Power plants are typically refueled every 18 to 24 months [2].  This means we're looking at a 30 to 40 ton bare payload.  We're already in super-heavy launch vehicle territory, and we haven't even added the actual vehicle that would carry the waste.\n\nHowever, this would only launch the waste to LEO.  This is very dangerous, because the orbit will likely eventually degrade, and the waste will one day fall back to Earth in some random location along its orbital plane.  Not good.\n\nSo we need to launch into an escape velocity.  This requires much more dV, and thus a much larger rocket.\n\nYou could, of course, break up the spent fuel between multiple launches, but this means you're spending more time handling nuclear waste.\n\nAnd *none* of this takes into account the order of magnitude more non-fuel nuclear waste generated.  We still have to take care of *that* waste.\n\nFinally, that nuclear waste might not be worth anything today, but it's entirely possible that it could be reprocessed into usable fuel and other useful products.  This is especially true of the waste being generated right now.  We almost certainly won't be able to dig up and launch long-since buried waste, so we'll only be launching the most potentially useful waste into space.\n\n* [1] http://www.nei.org/Knowledge-Center/Nuclear-Statistics/On-Site-Storage-of-Nuclear-Waste\n* [2] http://neinuclearnotes.blogspot.com/2012/05/what-happens-during-refueling-outage.html\n ", "id": "dapp3ft"}], [{"comment": "Cost is the big factor.

RP1/Lox (used in the first stage of Saturn V and in most Russian launchers) releases a lot of CO*_2_* contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Solid fuels like APCP (used in first stage boosters) emit not only CO*_2_* but also hydrogen chloride, which may produce hydrochloric acid when in contact with humidity in the air.

Flat implies curvature of exactly 0, so curvature of 0.0000001 is still positively curved, close to flat, but not flat. And that curvature changes over time. The fact that we see it close to flat now doesn't mean that it had to be close to flat in the past; it had to be incredibly close to flat. Also remember that a flat Universe implies that the density of the Universe must equal the critical density. But why? Why should the Universe have exactly that density? Let's think of this from a mass perspective and not a density perspective just for argument's sake; it's not quite right but is just to give a sense of the scale. The Universe has about 10^53 kg of ordinary matter. 1 part in 10^62 means that the Universe has exactly the \"critical mass\" to within 1 nanogram. That just seems really specific and there's not really a good reason why the Universe would have to have mass equal to the \"critical mass\", or again, more appropriately, density equal to the critical density.\n\nAs to your second points, the CMB does have variations at about the 1 part in 10^5 level, it's just that those variations are statistically similar for all directions across the sky (isotropy). Homogeneous and istropic means statistically similar, not the same everywhere, otherwise we'd have issues with the fact that we're on a planet, which has fairly high density compared to the rest of the Universe. Those two conditions hold at around the ~100 megaparsec level (Universe is about 14 gigaparsecs in size). At that level of variations though, if you work it back, that still implies that the Universe had to be really similar in temperature everywhere, even in regions not in causal contact with one another. So let's say inflation didn't happen. Somehow, quantum fluctuations created some variations in the temperature at the very early Universe. The Universe expanded and so the regions of those temperature differences grew in size. If that kept going, we would expect to see great variations in the CMB temperature. But we don't, they're really tiny today, 1 part in 10^5 like I said. So, if you work backwards, then you'd have to have the quantum fluctuation variations having to be really really small but still non-zero. Fine-tuned incredibly closely to zero but still not quite there.\n\nInflation solves both problems. The Universe could have started however it wanted but then it would have smoothed out in temperature and flattened out in curvature.

It's talking about *snails* which are a significant part of the diets of many sea birds. Their transport need not have been accidental at all, they could have been deliberately carried as food. It's hard to generalize from snails to \"eggs accidentally sticking to the feet of wading birds\". One wonders that if this is a common occurrence, how come nobody has demonstrated it happening today when we have such a profusion of sea birds and water bodies and aquatic life ready to be accidentally transported.\n\nAnother problem people raise with this scenario is \"but what about the amniotic egg?\" Doesn't evolution tell us that the big step that enabled life to leave the sea for good some 300-odd million years ago was the development of the amniotic egg?

Isn't that why *amniota* is the base clade for all of us reptiles, birds and mammals, assorted chordates that left the sea?\n\nSo how would this work with fish eggs? Could a fish egg, lacking a shell or amniotic membrane even survive a trip of thousands of miles through the air, stuck to a bird's feet? Wouldn't it just dry out and die?\n\nAgain, I agree that the bird's feet hypothesis seems quite reasonable on the face of it, but I haven't come across any convincing evidence that it really happens.

Since this is caused by expansion of the space in between, the bodies aren't moving faster than light and thus there is no violation of the speed of causality.\n\nLastly, your original question is a big question in astrophysics.  The question basically goes: we observe that the universe is homogeneous.  In order for this to happen, at some point in time the universe must have all been in thermal equilibrium.  However straight expansion is too fast to allow thermal equilibrium before parts of the universe are too far apart to communicate.  The leading hypothesis is called inflation.  Basically, very early on, the universe expanded slower than now and came to equilibrium.  Then there was a period of inflation where the universe expanded extremely rapidly.

The better name is speed of causality.  It is the speed at which everything in the universe moves through spacetime and thus the speed at which objects can interact.  Photons, being massless, have no component of velocity in the time direction (the why here is a whole other rabbit hole) and thus move at c in the spacial dimensions.  Just because you can't move through spacetime faster than c doesn't mean that empty spacetime can't change size.  It expands uniformly which inevitably means two distant areas will increase in distance faster than c.  The way to interpret this is that you are moving apart so fast enough that it is not possible to be causally linked.  An analogy is with supersonic flow.  If we are moving apart from each other faster than the speed of sound, no matter what you do, no noise you make will ever make it to me.\n\nAs a sidebar, expansion falls out of relativity and occurs in the more or less vacuum of intergalactic space.  However, there is too much mass density within a galaxy and thus expansion does not occur (the why here is what I don't really understand).  So in a local region, expansion is not affecting relative distances.\n\nThe first way I thought I understood was that it did expand within a galaxy, but gravity pulls you back in faster.  This is NOT the case.  The mass density prevents expansion due the laws of nature as expressed in the governing relativity equation.

But that is how I wrote it. So, well, poo. \n\n## Discussion about the problem\n\nFirst and foremost, your question actually has no definitive answer. It is much too complex to say \"Oh 3.1 times faster,\" and have it be true. Still, it does provide an avenue to talk *about* some really cool and fascinating research that is currently going on information theory revolving around distributed function computations. \n\nSo, we can not really increase bandwidth without adding extra communication links. Our current system is already extremely efficient in terms of rate and bandwidth trade off for point to point links. There are some protocols which could theoretically increase the overall amount of information that can flow through a network, such as [network coding](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs783/2007fa/papers/acly.pdf) (or for a [less technical source](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2342846/data-breach/how-mit-and-caltech-s-coding-breakthrough-could-accelerate-mobile-network-speeds.html) ), but this is really tangential to what I wanted to discuss.\n\n\nInstead, in the information theoretic literature, there has been some really exciting work recently dealing with **distributed functional computations.** Now what is oh so cool about this is that it can basically be seen as a variant of a [Slepian-Wolf coding problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slepian%E2%80%93Wolf_coding) if the answer is required to be precise, or alternatively a [Wyner-Ziv coding problem](http://web.stanford.edu/~bgirod/pdfs/AaronDCC03.pdf) if lossy answers are allowed.\n\nAlthough, I do not believe networks exhibit source channel separation, coding for practical cases would be insane. Source channel separation is a nice feature in point to point communications where we can preform the channel coding and source-coding separately. In the name of practice, we will take the rate penalty so that we can actually implement. The upshot of this means that we can view the problem, in some vague sense, as you have above. We have a certain number of users, if we can calculate the data rates they would need, then we can determine the amount of bandwidth the system would need as a whole.\n\n## Discussion about distributed function computation and compression\n\nSo distributed function computation can be viewed as a method of compressing an item and sending the relevant information. Take for example a video game. Your character is going through perhaps dodging for it's life because you burned through all your estus. \n\nFrom frame to frame of this sequence, the picture will not be significantly changing.

So, well, poo. \n\n## Discussion about the problem\n\nFirst and foremost, your question actually has no definitive answer. It is much too complex to say \"Oh 3.1 times faster,\" and have it be true. Still, it does provide an avenue to talk *about* some really cool and fascinating research that is currently going on information theory revolving around distributed function computations. \n\nSo, we can not really increase bandwidth without adding extra communication links. Our current system is already extremely efficient in terms of rate and bandwidth trade off for point to point links. There are some protocols which could theoretically increase the overall amount of information that can flow through a network, such as [network coding](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs783/2007fa/papers/acly.pdf) (or for a [less technical source](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2342846/data-breach/how-mit-and-caltech-s-coding-breakthrough-could-accelerate-mobile-network-speeds.html) ), but this is really tangential to what I wanted to discuss.\n\n\nInstead, in the information theoretic literature, there has been some really exciting work recently dealing with **distributed functional computations.** Now what is oh so cool about this is that it can basically be seen as a variant of a [Slepian-Wolf coding problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slepian%E2%80%93Wolf_coding) if the answer is required to be precise, or alternatively a [Wyner-Ziv coding problem](http://web.stanford.edu/~bgirod/pdfs/AaronDCC03.pdf) if lossy answers are allowed.\n\nAlthough, I do not believe networks exhibit source channel separation, coding for practical cases would be insane. Source channel separation is a nice feature in point to point communications where we can preform the channel coding and source-coding separately. In the name of practice, we will take the rate penalty so that we can actually implement. The upshot of this means that we can view the problem, in some vague sense, as you have above. We have a certain number of users, if we can calculate the data rates they would need, then we can determine the amount of bandwidth the system would need as a whole.\n\n## Discussion about distributed function computation and compression\n\nSo distributed function computation can be viewed as a method of compressing an item and sending the relevant information. Take for example a video game. Your character is going through perhaps dodging for it's life because you burned through all your estus. \n\nFrom frame to frame of this sequence, the picture will not be significantly changing. In that sense, we can use our current frame as an estimate of the next frame to come. Thus the offsite computation, only needs to compute the difference between our estimate and the actual value, and then send us that information.\n\nWe can now begin to discuss limits of this for very simple problems. So we will let X represent the information the offsite computation has to send, Y be our own estimate, and Z = g(X,Y) be the truth value, and Z' be what we actually estimate (Z' does not need to equal Z if we accept some loss of information, think lossy compression). In this simple case, the amount of information that needs to be sent is lower bounded by\n\n    min I(X;U|Y)\n\nwhere the min is over all joint probability distributions of X and U, such that g(U,Y) is sufficiently close to g(X,Y), also I(X;U|Y) is the [mutual information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) of random variables X and U, conditioned on Y.

A Keq >> 1 would then indicate a favorable reaction whereas a Keq << 1 would indicate no reaction.", "id": "danxitp"}, {"comment": "My knowledge about physical chemistry is really limited, since I really struggle to understand the concepts. I am still studying and that in Germany so I don't understand all ur terminology (equilibrium being on if it).

E.g normal oxygen would be really happy to react with everything on earth, in this reactions of course energy would be released, thus the compound would be on a lower energy level. But oxygen is paramagnetic and mostly everything else on earth diamagnetic, thus no reaction happens at normal temperature because some thermodynamic law ( or something like that) says the spins are not allowed to change in a reaction. \n\nSo what I want to say is that you can determine based on thermodynamics if a reaction would happen at which circumstances.

Chlorine is one of the most electronegative elements and it's really \"unhappy\" that it has to share 3 electrons with fluorine, the most electronegative element.

There are canals on Mars deeper by magnitudes than the Grand Canyon, the largest unsubmerged canyon on Earth.  You can use this as evidence that Mars had an atmosphere and rain necessary to create constant water flows.  Other geographic evidence shows it possible that it had seas and oceans.  The erosion and oxidation evidence there was at one time alot of water and it existed for a long time.

If things played out similar to Earth then the equivalent of animals and plants would have been a long way off when Mars \"went bad\".\n\nHowever, the fact that multicellular animal life did not appear on Earth until ~600Ma ago does not preclude finding macroscopic fossils of other things much earlier.  There are plenty of macrofossils in the deep Precambrian on Earth going back billions of years.  You mention \"algae sheets\" (I assume you mean metaphyte algae like \"seaweed\"), but even single-celled organisms can produce macrofossils.  [Stromatolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromatolite) and microbial mat structures can be quite large -- tens of cm to even metres scale.  Stromatolites are found on Earth as far back as 3.5Ga, so it is conceivable that similar structures could be found in similar-aged rocks on Mars.  Furthermore, on Earth, that 3.5Ga limit is more a factor of not having older rocks in decent enough shape to tell if such structures were present (e.g., metamorphic rocks that are too deformed and heated to preserve fossils).  There is isotopic evidence that life went back even further, to about 3.8Ga, but at that point the preservation potential for even isotopic signatures drops to almost nothing.  The first half billion years on Earth (the Hadean Eon) could have had life, for example, but if so it would be regularly pummelled by gigantic impacts and few rocks of any type exist from that era on Earth, let alone ones that could preserve fossils even if life happened to be there.  Earth just doesn't have a good fossil record for its first billion years or so.  It's too geologically active.\n\nThe current rovers are well equipped to spot structures at the scale of stromatolite or microbial mat fossils if they did occur on Mars.  Unfortunately, they haven't found anything convincing.  There are beautiful sedimentary structures in the right sort of deposits to see signs of life like that (e.g., finely laminated lake deposits in Gale Crater), but they are disappointingly barren looking.  There's one paper claiming to have found microbial mat structures in the Curiosity imagery, but it is not accepted by most other scientists familiar with the subject.", "id": "dakzcdi"}, {"comment": "> Stromatolites are found on Earth as far back as 3.5Ga, so it is conceivable that similar structures could be found in similar-aged rocks on Mars\n\nStromatolites were my immediate response, glad someone has posted it.

I didn't think of metazoan trace fossils also being an option.  Those are also present in the Precambrian, though they only go back about as far as metazoan body fossils do.  They animals have to be a decent size to start affecting sediments enough to see them, and that may be a limitation both in terms of what we can see of the first multicellular animals on Earth and hypothetically on Mars.  Smaller nematodes merely fit between the sediment grains or disturb laminations at such a small scale they would be hard to reliably recognize versus other (non-biological) processes.  Same for any other multicellular but tiny creatures like water bears (tardigrades) and many others.  So, maybe you could have metazoans going back further, but the record of them would still be pretty cryptic until they got bigger.\n\nStromatolites or microbial mats are still the best bet for something macroscopic because they go back billions of years on Earth and are expected to be present from very early in the history of life.", "id": "dal5cgp"}, {"comment": "How do we even get fossils of single-celled organisms?", "id": "dal31xo"}, {"comment": "As mentioned in another post, stromatolites and microbial mats are macroscopic sedimentary structures that are formed by communities of single-celled organisms.  It's an oversimplication, but basically the stickiness of the mat of algae and bacteria growing on the sea, lake, or hotspring floor causes sediment to build up in structures that are distinctive compared to non-biological processes.  The activities of the community also change the local chemisty, which can cause precipitation of minerals around them.\n\nSecondly, if you have exceptional preservation it is possible to preserve the shape of microscopic cellular-scale details too.  Usually it is only the cell walls that are preserved, usually by precipitation of minerals around the cells concurrently with them being alive or slightly after death.  Chert (microcrystalline quartz) is a particularly common way to do it.  The Gunflint Chert is a famous example with all sorts of algal-bacterial filaments and cells caught in the midst of dividing.  [Here's a fairly general account with some pictures](http://historyoftheearthcalendar.blogspot.ca/2014/01/january-18-gunflint-chert.html).  [Here's a more technical paper by Schopf](http://www.cornellcollege.edu/geology/courses/greenstein/paleo/schopf_07.pdf) [PDF].  There's a long history of trying to distinguish microfossils from the products of non-biogenic processes in the Precambrian, and paleontologists sometimes get it wrong, but even so there are many confident examples and we can see it happening today at sites such as hotsprings.\n\nIf you want to dig into the older story on Earth, which is likely to be the one relevant to Mars, I recommend this whole book on Precambrian fossils by Schopf: Schopf, J.W. 1999.  [Cradle of Life: The Discovery of Earth's Earliest Fossils](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6542.html).  Princeton University Press.\n\nFinally, there are some single-celled creatures that create mineralized shells or that produce durable, acid-resistant organic-walled structures.  Several types of single-celled creatures do this, although most of them are eukaryotes and therefore found younger in Earth history.  Many of them are found as plankton in the oceans.  For example, [foraminifera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraminifera) make calcite/limestone tests (shells) or stick together mineral grains, [diatoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatom) make silica frustules, many [dinoflagellates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinoflagellate) make organic-walled cysts, [acritarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acritarch) are organic-walled cysts and many are probably planktonic algae.  There are also [conodonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conodont) which are tiny, phosphatic teeth [edit: but conodonts are multicellar microfossils -- got carried away].\n\nThe organic-walled ones (types of [palynomorphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palynology)) are pretty amazing.  The organic material won't dissolve in concentrated HCl or HF acids, so you just use those acids to dissolve away the minerals in the rock.\n\nIf you are interested in more information about these, look up the general subject of microfossils.

Its just not massive enough to have a very high escape velocity, which means it's relatively easy for most atmospheric molecules to eventually get moving fast enough to leave the planet entirely.\n\nAfter all, consider Venus: it has no intrinsic magnetosphere, yet it maintains an atmosphere 92x thicker than Earth's.", "id": "dalg2d2"}], [{"comment": "Sometimes it helps to step out to the farthest level to appreciate exactly how life functions.  So we have a planet that has had a mostly stable biosphere for billions of years.

All this being said there were 5 catastrophic events that caused massive die offs in the fossil record and lead to the rise of the survivors becoming diversified in earth's biospheres.  The background radiation level being what it is determines the mutation rate in the population and earth happens to fall into the happy band where mutation happens but not so wildly as to cause a species to become non-viable.  This as it turns out is very important for evolution, to little mutation and nothing happens, too much and nothing works.  Additionally the Moon, it is without a doubt been a critical factor for the evolution of life on this planet as it has influenced so much of life on the planet but interestingly enough been a buffer against meteorites and comets.  Finally earth's magnetosphere is one of the most crucial components of our planet, without it our atmosphere would've been scoured of hydrogen long ago, as is the sun will eventually win that battle in about a billion years.  \nSo Mars...had almost none of that, multiple impact events and was tectonically dead for most of its major planetary features like Olympus Mons, meaning isolated water on Mars.  It lost its core heat fast and only boasted a small magnetosphere.

(non-scientific) Because it's in a less-known journal and a single-authored paper, which makes it a bit odd for such an important discovery.  It is unlikely something this important would go to Astrobiology rather than, say, Nature or Science IF it could get past the review stage in either of the latter journals, suggesting that it either didn't get submitted there (odd) or couldn't get past review in those or in other better-known journals that would allow a longer paper;\n\n2. (scientific) As near as I can tell, all the structures compared to microbial mat structures are related to differential erosion of the rocks on Mars by the current conditions rather than structures contained within the ancient sediment layers themselves.  They are weathering features.  And I don't mean weathering of possible ancient microbial mat features embedded in the rocks to re-expose them.  I mean just plain old weathering that produces interesting textures of its own in wind-blown, dry conditions.  The comparison sketches look superficially similar, but they are comparing apples and oranges throughout.  For example, the supposed \"roll-up\" structures in Fig. 4 are completely unconvincing as something ancient within the rock rather than merely the way the outcrop has weathered.  They don't look like a sedimentary layer that has been folded over, which is the defining feature of genuine \"roll-up\" structures on Earth, well illustrated in the other half of the figure.\n\nWeathering features have to be discerned before you can interpret any ancient structures.  Post-depositional diagenetic features like veins also have to be recognized before interpreting depositional features (this applies to Fig. 6).  To put it bluntly, the author has not successfully done that, and I don't understand why such seemingly fundamental flaws are in there.\n\nAs you can see, both of these are my own opinion rather than something I can document, because I've seen nothing formal in print that I could cite.

There are canals on Mars deeper by magnitudes than the Grand Canyon, the largest unsubmerged canyon on Earth.  You can use this as evidence that Mars had an atmosphere and rain necessary to create constant water flows.  Other geographic evidence shows it possible that it had seas and oceans.  The erosion and oxidation evidence there was at one time alot of water and it existed for a long time.  For this to have occurred, it needed to have been much warmer so there must have been at one point alot more tectonic movement and geothermal energy or possibly the planet was significantly closer to the sun than it currently is.

For example, [this chart](http://i.imgur.com/GbkLZKQ.jpg) shows the different kinds of snowflakes that will form under different conditions. You can clearly see many of these shapes in [this series real images](http://i.imgur.com/CVnnAUU.jpg) taken at high magnification. Now it is true that most of the flakes on both sets of images consist of flat and highly branched structures. The reason for this typical shape is due to 1) the hexagonal crystal structure of ice and 2) the rate at which different facets grow as the flake is forming. \n\nLet's look at this process in more detail. Snowflake formation begins with the growth of a small hexagonal base, [as shown here](http://i.imgur.com/dcOAyDs.jpg). The reason for this hexagonal shape is due to the crystalline network that ice likes to take under conditions we are used to. What happens next is a mixture of atmospheric conditions and random chance. There are three main processes that will determine the final shape of the flake:^(1)\n\n1. **Faceting:** Different parts of a snowflake will naturally show edges with the same symmetry as the crystal structure of the ice.\n\n2. **Branching:** As the crystal grows, some faces can start to grow faster than others. As they grow, each bit of the crystal will develop its own facets. This process can then repeat again and again creating the fractal-like shape we associate with snowflakes.\n\n3. **Sharpening:** As snowflakes grow, their edges tend to become thinner. Again, this has to do with the fact that the edges tend to grow more quickly than the interior so that the flake tends to taper off. \n  \nAs the chart in the first paragraph implies, atmospheric conditions will have a big effect in shaping these processes. As a result, at a given temperature and humidity, certain structures will tend to dominate. However, the exact details of how each flake will form also depends very strongly on the *exact* conditions it experiences. The problem is that the system is chaotic. In other words, even small differences in the initial shape of the flake or the layers of air it tumbled through can have a big effect on its final shape. No wonder then that it is basically impossible to find two snowflakes that look exactly the same!\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1. Kenneth G.

This prism grows as more ice molecules stick to its faces. It turns out that under conditions found in common snowstorms, some facets in XY plane tend to grow much faster than the facets along the main axis of the crystal. As a result, snowflakes usually end up looking like flat pancakes with many finger-like branches. "], [80, "This has to do with the nature of ice crystals. The H20 molecule aligns with other H20 molecules forming sheets of hexagons. The sheets tend to build on each other, making them thicker, but the initial structure is 2D.\n"], [48, "To add on a little bit to what u/crnaruka said, the growth of snowflakes originally starts with a small hexagonal ice crystal or ice nuclei. \n\nThe best ice nuclei (IN) are ones that are in a very similar [geometry](http://openscience.org/~chrisfen/Pages/Research/iceImages/ice1h/1h001.png) to of [Ice Ih](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/725px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png) which forms in our atmosphere. The best IN that we use in cloud seeding is Silver Iodide. Other good IN that are found in the atmosphere are Kaolinite, bacteria, and many others. Ice can grow off of IN in three ways:\n\n1. Deposition onto the IN directly (water vapor freezing onto the crystal)\n2. Condensation on to the IN and then freezing.\n3. Immersion of the IN into a water droplet and then reaching the temperature in which freezing will occur.\n4. Contact of an IN with a supercooled water droplet\n\nAnyway, once this seed crystal is established, an ice crystal can continue to grow through diffusional growth or by riming.\nRiming will create [graupel \\(which look like dip n dots\\) or hail](http://www.wmdt.com/image/view/-/39154854/medRes/1/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/hdusxfz/-/GraupelvHail-jpg.jpg) if the collection of supercooled water is high enough.\n\nHowever we care about growth of ice crystals, which is through diffusional growth. If the seed crystal is in a supersaturated environment the growth will be dominated by deposition. However, as soon as water vapor deposits onto ice, a large amount of latent heat is released due to the phase change. This heat will affect the supersaturation around that area, limiting the growth. So there is a balance between the diffusion of vapor toward the crystal and the diffusion of heat away from the crystal. \n\nThe \"desired\" growth rate depends primarily on the potential gradient around the ice crystal. This potential is not electric, but rather tied to the diffusion. If there is some curvature (which happens at 6 points around the hexagon seed crystal) it will enhance the growth rate locally by curving the potential lines and [depositing water vapor there](http://cdn.iopscience.com/images/0034-4885/68/4/R03/Full/rpp131559fig09.jpg) due to the Mullins-Sekerka instability.\n\nFinally, there's still a lot we don't know, but as computing advances are being made, out ability to model this type of behavior is becoming more realistic. [This paper](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/static/research/infovault/gravner/Phy_Rev_E-79-2009.pdf) from 2009 had incredible results, given some of the pretty hefty assumptions they made."], [4, "My big \"why?\" is why is it such a convenient size that we can see them by eye?

There are three main processes that will determine the final shape of the flake:^(1)\n\n1. **Faceting:** Different parts of a snowflake will naturally show edges with the same symmetry as the crystal structure of the ice.\n\n2. **Branching:** As the crystal grows, some faces can start to grow faster than others. As they grow, each bit of the crystal will develop its own facets. This process can then repeat again and again creating the fractal-like shape we associate with snowflakes.\n\n3. **Sharpening:** As snowflakes grow, their edges tend to become thinner. Again, this has to do with the fact that the edges tend to grow more quickly than the interior so that the flake tends to taper off. \n  \nAs the chart in the first paragraph implies, atmospheric conditions will have a big effect in shaping these processes. As a result, at a given temperature and humidity, certain structures will tend to dominate. However, the exact details of how each flake will form also depends very strongly on the *exact* conditions it experiences. The problem is that the system is chaotic. In other words, even small differences in the initial shape of the flake or the layers of air it tumbled through can have a big effect on its final shape. No wonder then that it is basically impossible to find two snowflakes that look exactly the same!\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1. Kenneth G.

This prism grows as more ice molecules stick to its faces. It turns out that under conditions found in common snowstorms, some facets in XY plane tend to grow much faster than the facets along the main axis of the crystal. As a result, snowflakes usually end up looking like flat pancakes with many finger-like branches.

And how can you tell visually?", "id": "daqzboq"}, {"comment": "Dry snow is typically the powdery snow, what we as ski and snowboarders live for. It's not as packable (as in making snowballs) but it's very fluffy, light and easily wind blown. When we ride on it it's like riding on a big fluffy cloud.\n\nWet snow. If you've ever made a snowman or a snowball that's the wetter snow. It's much easier to pack down. It also sticks to stuff like a shovel or snowboard more.\n\nThere's also artificial/man made snow, which many ski resorts use when the weather isn't dumping snow as much we'd hope. \n\nThis [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_snow) has some good information too.", "id": "dar1dd1"}, {"comment": "Dry snow can be packed too, but it requires more pressure and/or time to do so than wet snow, because... well, let me try to explain.\n\nPacking of snow happens when the ice crystals in it form connections with each other and create a somewhat interlocked shape. This requires the crystals to become in contact with enough other crystals for the connections to become strong enough to not break apart at the slightest stress.\n\nSnow is a mixture of ice crystals (of varying sizes and shapes), air, and water.\n\nThe amount of water mixed in with the snow depends mostly on temperature, but also humidity. When temperatures are over +0\u00b0C, the ice is melting, and the ice crystals are first covered in thin layer of liquid water. What happens next depends on humidity - if the air is dry, the water almost immediately vapourizes, which gives an appearance of the snow disappearing into air. If the air is humid - or temperature is high enough to melt the snow more rapidly than the water can vapourize - then the snow melts into a puddle, *or* the amount of liquid water in the snow can increase. This creates the so called \"wet snow\" here.\n\nDry snow means the snow is cold and/or the air is humid, so there is no significant build-up of liquid water in the mixture, but instead there can be a varying amount of air in the mixture. The more air there is, the looser the snow is - the less connected the individual crystals are. Powder snow has almost no water, and a lot of air, which is why it's so floofy, freely-moving, and easily thrown into air.\n\n\n\"Wet\" snow is easy and fast to pack because it has little air in it (it's dense), and the conditions are suitable for the ice crystals to stick to each other easily due to the thin layer of water coating them - there's no air to block the crystals from touching each other on many places, and the water layer causes them to connect readily with each other. However if there's too much water in the mixture, you end up with slush that doesn't hold together all that well...\n\nBut dry snow crystals can also get connected to each other, it just takes more time and effort depending on the temperature. Since increasing pressure reduces melting point, the easiest thing you can do to pack dry ice is to apply pressure to it. This means the ice crystals have more pressure on their connecting surfaces, which causes small amount of ice to melt and then re-freeze. You can even do this by repeatedly squeezing dry snow, and it will eventually form something resembling a snowball (though it will be more fragile than a \"wet\" snowball).\n\nBut the easiest way to pack dry snow is to just make a big pile of it and then let it set. The pile will basically harden into its shape, and it will be solid enough that you can hollow it out to make a temporary shelter.\n\nThis also happens naturally: Powder snow only really exists immediately after a cold-weather snowfall, when the snow doesn't immediately get packed as it falls to the ground. So there's a difference between dry snow types, too...\n\nThen there's stuff like what happens when the surface of the snow cover gets melted in the spring sun and then hardens during night-time to form a tough cover on top of the snow - sometimes durable enough to allow walking on it with no skis or snowshoes... and how humidity and temperature interact with sublimation and deposition of ice on top of existing snow (bigger ice crystals behave a lot differently than smaller, more powdery crystals)...\n\nAnd of course then there's what happens to snow as it falls on top of a glacier - as it piles up ever higher and higher, it goes through several different allotropes of snow, until it turns into solid ice, and then the ice itself can experience phase transitions between different crystal configurations depending on the pressure...", "id": "dar9qzi"}, {"comment": "As a Canadian, I feel like I can answer this question. Wet snow is snow which has much more water in it, it's heavier and sticks together. It tends to fall when the weather is mild (as in a couple degrees below freezing). Dry snow is basically piled snowflakes with little water content (except for the ice of course). It's fluffy, a lot lighter doesn't stick to itself so it is horrible for making snowmen and snowballs out of. Wind blowing on dry snow makes for blizzard conditions.

[Someone below posted a pretty good image demonstrating why, but maybe consider this one instead](https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/Graphics-Geol/ROCKMIN/ATOM-STRUCT/IceItop.gif).

A hex of water with 2 branching hydrogens  has 3 O atoms, and only -2 charge, while 3 O atoms requires 3x H2O molecules with total -3 charge. -2 is better potential energy usage than -3, and so it is favored.

The best IN that we use in cloud seeding is Silver Iodide. Other good IN that are found in the atmosphere are Kaolinite, bacteria, and many others. Ice can grow off of IN in three ways:\n\n1. Deposition onto the IN directly (water vapor freezing onto the crystal)\n2. Condensation on to the IN and then freezing.\n3. Immersion of the IN into a water droplet and then reaching the temperature in which freezing will occur.\n4. Contact of an IN with a supercooled water droplet\n\nAnyway, once this seed crystal is established, an ice crystal can continue to grow through diffusional growth or by riming.\nRiming will create [graupel \\(which look like dip n dots\\) or hail](http://www.wmdt.com/image/view/-/39154854/medRes/1/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/hdusxfz/-/GraupelvHail-jpg.jpg) if the collection of supercooled water is high enough.\n\nHowever we care about growth of ice crystals, which is through diffusional growth. If the seed crystal is in a supersaturated environment the growth will be dominated by deposition. However, as soon as water vapor deposits onto ice, a large amount of latent heat is released due to the phase change. This heat will affect the supersaturation around that area, limiting the growth. So there is a balance between the diffusion of vapor toward the crystal and the diffusion of heat away from the crystal. \n\nThe \"desired\" growth rate depends primarily on the potential gradient around the ice crystal. This potential is not electric, but rather tied to the diffusion. If there is some curvature (which happens at 6 points around the hexagon seed crystal) it will enhance the growth rate locally by curving the potential lines and [depositing water vapor there](http://cdn.iopscience.com/images/0034-4885/68/4/R03/Full/rpp131559fig09.jpg) due to the Mullins-Sekerka instability.\n\nFinally, there's still a lot we don't know, but as computing advances are being made, out ability to model this type of behavior is becoming more realistic.

Some of those reactions produce different elements as an end result. Some of them produce neutrons, protons, and deuterons as a byproduct, which can react with other nuclei to produce elements that have an odd number of protons (either through, say, proton/deuteron capture, or successive neutron capture (the s-process) coupled with beta decay, or a combination of both processes).\n\nAdditionally, there are processes which occur during the explosion of supernovae such as fast neutron capture (the r-process), neutrino spallation, photo-disintegration, as well as fusion (the shock front of the supernova explosion will experience conditions of extreme temperature and pressure, even if only temporarily) all of which can create new elements.

Just like a single vector can be described as a sum of orthogonal vectors pointing in the x, y, and z directions. But if we rotate our axes we could also describe the same vector as being purely in the x direction. Or think of polarized photons - a photon polarized at +45 degrees can be described as a combination of 0 degrees and +90 degrees polarization states added together in phase, or we can pick basis states that lie at +45 and -45 degrees, and describe the same polarization as purely in the +45 degree state. \n\nThe other issue is whether a particle can be in two places at the same time, and that requires you to pick a specific interpretation of what the equations of quantum mechanics actually mean. There are currently multiple interpretations that we can't distinguish between with experiments, and we may not ever be able to distinguish between them, so there isn't a single answer here. In the double slit experiment, you can define one state that purely goes through slit 1 and another state that purely goes through slit 2. When we know a single electron enters the apparatus, we then describe it as being in a superposition of those two states, and the wave function extends over both.

For Tononi this is a pragmatic question since his work addresses a very real problem:\n\npeople waking up in the middle of surgery and suffering immensely and being unable to communicate their pain.\n\nPart of the reason this can happen is that there is (currently) no perfectly objective \"consciousness meter\". We have intuitions that tell us a chair is not conscious, and a 3-year old child probably is, but no objective way of measuring it.\n\nSo, consciousness is that state of mind that is (for lack of a better word) capable of *being* or *experiencing* things.\n\nThe ability to then reflect back and know that you are *a being* and *experiencing things* might be some kind of metacognitive thing on top of consciousness.

There are two which need to be distinguished here:\n\n* The gamma doesn't necessarily deposit the exact photopeak mean energy. This could be in part due to attenuation, like you said.\n\n* Energy deposition, signal generation, and subsequent processing and readout of the electrical signal are stochastic processes, which introduce some variance in the actual recorded value.\n\nYou touched on the first, but I think you may have been overlooking the second.\n\nThe fact is that even if you could somehow eliminate all attenuation of the gamma, and somehow force it to deposit its full energy into the photopeak, you'd still get some Gaussian-esque spread in your energy spectrum because your detector and electronics are not perfect.\n\nIn this way, it makes perfect sense for fluctuations *above* or *below* the mean to occur. Whereas in the other bullet point, if the gamma loses energy before undergoing the photoelectric effect, you'd only see fluctuations *below* the expected photopeak energy.\n\nFurthermore, I should point out that individual gamma rays don't lose energy as a gradual attenuation. The total gamma intensity is attenuated exponentially when they are incident on some material. But each individual gamma ray loses energy \"catastrophically\".\n\nThis is in contrast with heavy charged particles, which lose energy quasi-continuously as they simultaneously interact with many surrounding atoms.\n\n\"Catastrophic\" interactions, which are what happens with high energy photons and neutrons, are the opposite of that. A gamma ray moves through the material completely undisturbed, until some particular point when it interacts (assuming it does at all). At that point, it potentially loses a significant amount of energy, and potentially changes direction radically. Whereas a heavy charged fragment would lose energy continuously and barrel through matter with its energy and direction essentially unchanged by each of the thousands of collisions it undergoes."], [3, "This is because it is counting photons. Look at the whole process:\n\nFirst a gamma ray enters the scintillator, and creates scintillation photons in the material.

There are two which need to be distinguished here:\n\n* The gamma doesn't necessarily deposit the exact photopeak mean energy. This could be in part due to attenuation, like you said.\n\n* Energy deposition, signal generation, and subsequent processing and readout of the electrical signal are stochastic processes, which introduce some variance in the actual recorded value.\n\nYou touched on the first, but I think you may have been overlooking the second.\n\nThe fact is that even if you could somehow eliminate all attenuation of the gamma, and somehow force it to deposit its full energy into the photopeak, you'd still get some Gaussian-esque spread in your energy spectrum because your detector and electronics are not perfect.\n\nIn this way, it makes perfect sense for fluctuations *above* or *below* the mean to occur. Whereas in the other bullet point, if the gamma loses energy before undergoing the photoelectric effect, you'd only see fluctuations *below* the expected photopeak energy.\n\nFurthermore, I should point out that individual gamma rays don't lose energy as a gradual attenuation. The total gamma intensity is attenuated exponentially when they are incident on some material. But each individual gamma ray loses energy \"catastrophically\".\n\nThis is in contrast with heavy charged particles, which lose energy quasi-continuously as they simultaneously interact with many surrounding atoms.\n\n\"Catastrophic\" interactions, which are what happens with high energy photons and neutrons, are the opposite of that. A gamma ray moves through the material completely undisturbed, until some particular point when it interacts (assuming it does at all). At that point, it potentially loses a significant amount of energy, and potentially changes direction radically. Whereas a heavy charged fragment would lose energy continuously and barrel through matter with its energy and direction essentially unchanged by each of the thousands of collisions it undergoes.", "id": "dal46mh"}, {"comment": "Thank you for this great explanation.

For example, a cluster of asteroids carrying a static charge might get flung into interstellar space, leaving behind the solar system with a net electric charge.\n\nAs far as fluctuations in the quantum vacuum giving rise to a net charge, there's no evidence for that which I'm aware of. If vacuum fluctuations were to give rise to charged particles, they do so pairwise, which means you won't see particles with a positive charge being generated spontaneously without their corresponding negative particle. This has to do with [conservation of charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_conservation), which in turn ties into conservation of energy. Every place in the universe has some electric field (however weak), so if you spontaneously generate a positively charged particle all by itself, there is a corresponding amount of work that needs to be done to put it into the surrounding electric field. This would mean that energy (the work done to insert the new charged particle into the universe) would be created, which isn't allowed. I don't think I have done the best job in the world explaining, but the short answer is that net charges can't be created by vacuum fluctuations. If particle pairs are being generated in the solar system, they're going to be very close together and won't be escaping each other, so the whole system remains neutral.", "id": "damayxo"}]]], "5gadti": ["What is the exact reason to why tokamaks doesn't generate energy?", "2016-12-03 19:46:42", 13, "https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5gadti/what_is_the_exact_reason_to_why_tokamaks_doesnt/", [[11, "First the tokamak is actually really good confinement concept.

In particular it can be noted that the process of computing the derived key from a fingerprint is repeatable (that is, a user with the fingerprint and access to the key derivation function, including the saved salt, can derive the same key) but not reversible (a user with access only to the derived key and the key derivation function, including salt, cannot recover the fingerprint).  This kind of one-way function behavior implies a loss of information, which in turn can be understood as a reduction of entropy.

One trivial way you could enable either/or unlocking is to simply store a copy of the fingerprint image (or whatever derived quantity you use as encryption key) in the secure repository encrypted with the PIN, and store a copy of the PIN (or whatever derived quantity you use as encryption key) in the secure repository encrypted with the fingerprint image.

Encryption of the actual main data on disk would not be any more challenging (since you'd simply be picking one of the two keys and using that as the disk encryption key).

Unfortunately it's a bit technical to describe an experiment that shows the difference, as the simplest experiment where you just take two entangled states, measure each one, and compare the results looks the same whether you think about entangled states or definite but unknown states. The most famous experiment involves measuring \"Bell's Inequality\". In that experiment you measure the probabilistic correlation between the result of measuring the first particle along one polarization axis, and the other particle along a different polarization axis.

For isotopes with short half lives, only a very small amount is required to make something dangerously radioactive.", "id": "dap8z8n"}], [{"comment": "This happens because of [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay)\n\nThere are a few types of radioactive decay and all of them end up emitting some various forms of subatomic particles that as stated, can be absorbed, thus changing the energy in the systems they're affecting.  The types of affects can range from ionization (from addition or reduction of electrons and even photons) to destabilization of the atomic nuclei.  Point is, they're adding energy to other systems from the decay that they're undergoing and that energy has to be transferred somewhere according to thermodynamics.", "id": "danoizi"}], [{"comment": "Neutrons. Neutrons, being neutral, can penetrate even solid matter to some distance, though not terribly far. A neutron hitting a nucleus can potentially bind to that nucleus, transforming it to a different isotope. For example, Carbon-12 would become Carbon-13. If a radioactive substance or process emits neutrons, then it can transmute elements in its surroundings in this way.\n\nSome of these transmutations aren't terribly dangerous long-term. Oxygen can absorb a neutron to become O-16, which then emits a proton to decay into Nitrogen-16, and then beta decays back into Oxygen-16.\n\nBut sometimes this can create dangerous radio-isotopes. Naturally occurring Cobalt is Co-59, absorbing a neutron turns it into the extremely hazardous Cobalt-60, with a half-life of only 5 years. Such a short half-life means that the decay rate is very high, which means that the amount of radiation given off is very high. Chromium-51 (half-life of 28 days) is also problematic. You generally need to avoid using Cobalt and Chromium in steels used in construction of fission reactors, or be prepared to live with the consequences of heavily radioactive materials.", "id": "daope3a"}]]], "5g8ezt": ["Do power companies take advantage of lightning?
