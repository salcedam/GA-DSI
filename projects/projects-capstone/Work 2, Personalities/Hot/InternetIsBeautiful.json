It's not going to improve your day, or make you think anything other than \"I want my 3 minutes back.\" I just wanna talk, that's all.\n\nBefore I lived under [Aurora Urbanis](https://coolmedium.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/light-pollution.jpg), I was just on the edge of being able to see Aurora Borealis on a clear winter night. I used apps on my phone to notify me of such events. I also experimented with trying to photograph the streak of light from a passing satellite or two, to no effect. I found that I expended way more energy on the dashboard method than I did with apps/notifications. I spent measurable money on the electricity bill just to keep a dashboard running. As was mentioned in  a post up the chain, that's not how we're supposed to do it. Since then, I've thrown out every other \"dashboard\" on every machine I use, except the actual dashboard in my car.\n\nDashboards are only useful if someone needs to frequently refer to a dataset that changes in ways that affect their decision making. Tracking of space stuff isn't something that some bum in Minnesota has much use for, but if you're stuck in Yellowknife and make a few bucks on the side to take pretty pictures or experiment with lazorbeams, totes cool. \n\nNow, we just need to reform the dashboard setup of cars to fix a few antiquated problems, we'd be all set. I recommend we start by removing the dropdown rearview mirror on the windshield. That thing just makes us stressed about the traffic behind us. Next, we should add a text-based alert system instead of a check-engine light. NVM, just turn the damned thing into H+.\n\nOk, I'm done.

There it would merge and move again through the Native Lands. \n\nThe CSA looked asked for permission to move before doing so. Despite the fact that the Native Lands had agreed to a temporary occupation, the Midwest Alliance was uneasy with the idea.

This lead to retaliation from the MWA.\n\nKentucky fell first, and quickly. Unable to move their armies quickly enough to that area, the MWA decided to divert their forces back towards Ohio; knowing that if lost they could potentially lost large control over Lake Erie - a central trading connection. CSA spies fed misinformation advising that a naval assault was planned on the city of Detroit, in preparation the MWA moved its Erie force to protect the city. By the time that the MWA figured out that only a quarter of the fleet was being dispatched, it was too late - the Battle of Sandusky had begun. Heavy naval bombardment and a large push from the east resulted in total collapse of Ohio - the MWA now unable to stop the flow of enemy forces coming in. \n\nFor a year afterwards regular skirmishes would occur at the section of Toledo and the Michigan-Ohio border.

I love the simplistic design of the app but since you're the designer I was wondering if I'm understanding it correctly.\n\nFrom what I gather with Delay, Feedback and Scuzz all turned to 0 the instrument is essentially a single oscillator synthesizer. On the track pad, horizontal moment controls pitch and vertical movement gives control over a filter (low pass?). The options in the top are between the most common wave forms, sine, square, triangle and saw. When you play the instrument the animation is a visualization of the wave form being produced by the oscillator.\n\nIf that's all correct then the great thing for me is the visualization of the wave form. Especially if you start in the lower lefthand with a low pitch filtering out the higher frequencies and then moving to the right and seeing that waveform break apart and then reform, but as perfect fractions of the original waveform. I've seen this reproduced with a keyboard and a waveform visualizer but this is way more organic and hands on. What would be cool would be a fretboard feature of sorts (I know this goes against the idea of the theremin concept) that had scales or even hertz so that you could see how those waveforms broke down in a measurable way.\n\nI hope this made sense, I only sorta understand this stuff.

I love the simplistic design of the app but since you're the designer I was wondering if I'm understanding it correctly.\n\nFrom what I gather with Delay, Feedback and Scuzz all turned to 0 the instrument is essentially a single oscillator synthesizer. On the track pad, horizontal moment controls pitch and vertical movement gives control over a filter (low pass?). The options in the top are between the most common wave forms, sine, square, triangle and saw.

Especially if you start in the lower lefthand with a low pitch filtering out the higher frequencies and then moving to the right and seeing that waveform break apart and then reform, but as perfect fractions of the original waveform. I've seen this reproduced with a keyboard and a waveform visualizer but this is way more organic and hands on. What would be cool would be a fretboard feature of sorts (I know this goes against the idea of the theremin concept) that had scales or even hertz so that you could see how those waveforms broke down in a measurable way.\n\nI hope this made sense, I only sorta understand this stuff.

Is there an EILI5 for synths?", "id": "d2v2gwc"}, {"comment": "On Youtube there are a few \"synthesis explained\" videos if you're interested, but I'll give it a go:\n\nAn *oscillator* creates sound by generating harmonics based on its shape.  A sine wave creates a single harmonic at whatever frequency it oscillates at, so for example 440 Hz is an \"A\" on the piano.  Other waveforms (square, saw, etc) generate different sets of harmonics which are multiples of the fundamental frequency, just with different volumes (amplitudes).  Higher harmonics stacked together give sounds their 'buzz', or what is referred to often as their \"top-end\".  The effect is that a saw wave and a sine wave at the same frequency sound like the same pitch, but one is much buzzier than the other.\n\nWhen you drag on this synth, the left-to-right position controls the frequency of the oscillator, or how low- or high-pitched the note will be.  You see this visually in the repetition of the shape.  Near the left side you get a few peaks/valleys, and if you sweep to the right you will see more being added and squeezed into the same area, indicating a *higher frequency* being played.\n\nThe up and down direction controls the *low pass filter*.   What this means is that after the oscillator has generate the harmonics, we can choose to turn some of them off above a certain point.  If you choose a saw wave, and click on one spot low on the region and slowly drag up (without moving left or right) you will hear the same note start 'smooth' and get 'buzzy', as you allow those higher harmonics through the filter.\n\nDelay adds an 'echo' of the sound, which drops off according to the Feedback option.  So a small delay time makes rapid echoes and a long delay time spaces them out.  A low feedback means the delayed portion falls of quickly, and a high feedback means the \"delay gets delayed\" and it will echo for a longer time.\n\nScuzz I believe is some form of distortion, which essentially causes parts of the signal (the different harmonics, which are initially at different volume levels) to get boosted in volume.  It makes things sound 'gritty' for the most part.\n\nNot a true ELI5 but I hope it was a digestible summary for you!", "id": "d2v359j"}, {"comment": "Ok now someone ELI5...", "id": "d2v3efz"}, {"comment": "The different shapes make a different type of sound = markers versus pens versus paintbrushes.\n\nLeft and right make the note go lower or higher = changing colour of paint.\n\nUp and down makes the note get thinner or fuzzier = adding/removing water to thin it out or thicken it up.\n\nDelay and feedback control the echo = tapping the brush as you paint.\n\nScuzz makes it fuzzy = using a paper towel to smoosh what you're painting.", "id": "d2v3ne6"}, {"comment": "That was a perfect ELI5!", "id": "d2v47b1"}, {"comment": "Now I'm starting to get it.

The main note is loudest (highest amplitude) but there's \"harmonics\" all around it that make a guitar sound like a guitar.\n\nFor this instrument, only one \"pure\" wave is formed and controlled. Instead of physically changing how something vibrates to alter the sound, the wave itself can be changed before the instrument sends an audio signal out.\n\n>On the track pad, horizontal moment controls pitch and vertical movement gives control over a filter (low pass?). \n\nPitch (or frequency) can be changed by moving horizontally, and moving vertically will filter out specific sections of the wave. \n\n>The options in the top are between the most common wave forms, sine, square, triangle and saw.

Let's forget about this GCHQ project for a second.\n\nThere are many free and open-source software which are distributed as pre-compiled binaries and most of the users don't compile them themselves because that would take hours. For example, binary versions of [Firefox](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/www-client/firefox-bin) and [LibreOffice](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/app-office/libreoffice-bin) are present in Gentoo, a distribution that encourages users to compile and build everything themselves.

Even though I trust Mozilla and The Document Foundation, I don't think it's improbable that a malicious developer could upload malicious binaries of an open-source project.\n\n\nThe recent Dirty CoW exploit present in the Linux kernel had been there for about 9 years IIRC. Even though it may not have been put there deliberately but for 9 years, someone could get root access to your GNU/Linux computer without your consent and you can get root access to someone's Android phone in the years to come because their kernel won't be patched.

Why do you think that a serious bug such as this had been present in it for 9 years?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere's a difference between using open-source code from someone you can trust and from someone you can't. I trust Mozilla not to insert backdoors deliberately into Firefox but I don't trust Microsoft AT ALL. This means that if I was forced to use their open-source Chakra JS engine, I'd have to carefully monitor every line of code that they had, have, or will commit in their repositories.

Lastly, Tonal Harmony is the least-liked book among actual music theorists. To be clear, I said actual music theorists, not people who teach music theory classes but aren't actual theorists.

Try and get the 5-6 it recommends, but if you get slapped in the brain with insomnia, you might have to wake up a bit earlier than what you have your alarm set for to try and hit that in between sleep cycle stage.\n\nFor example, say you wanted to wake up tomorrow at 8am. Insomnia kicks in and you're detailing everything you've done in your life up to this point and still wondering why you are who you are. The best thing to do at this point is try and best gauge what time you are feasibly going to fall asleep and alter you're wake up time from there. Like I said, waking up between the cycles is important. You finally get groggy, and it's 4:20(blazeit)am. You are only going to get two full sleep cycles regardless of your wake up time at this point. From there though, waking up at 8am will be during a sleep cycle, thus making you feel unrested. Your new wake up time is now 7:20am, between sleep cycles and making you feel as fresh as possible. Falling asleep right away will give your brain the immediate shut down it needs instead of fighting to stay awake. Waking up a bit earlier will also give you're brain extra time to get itself going and its probably going to need it since you deprived it.\n\nThat is my interpretation of it anyway.

For example take Prosperity Dumpling that closed last year. It was a local favorite where you could get 5 wok-fried pork & chive dumplings for $1. It's all served out of an open kitchen where the guy cooks up large batches in 2 huge cast iron woks. Meanwhile he has a whole team of women behind him and even in the alley out back making the dumplings by hand.

There are certain things -- the geography and location of the Summer Islands, the placement of Qarth and the Jade Gates, everything east of Slaver's Bay and the Dothraki Sea... that you would have no way of knowing.\n\n>Of course having now finished the map I discover there is to be a Map of Ice and Fire book published later this year which will no doubt contain an official world map.

(Not a true world map, of course. If my world contains analogues of the Americas, Australia, Antarctica, and the like, the people of the Seven Kingdoms are unaware of them, so it did not seem right for the readers to know more than the characters.\n\n>I appreciate you don't have time for more than a cursory look over this and it won't match the real maps you're working on but I thought you might get a kick out of seeing it all the same.\n\n>I did.

Let me explain how I feel about this.\n\nEMDR is a very valid therapeutic tool used for those suffering from symptoms related to PTSD, anxiety and depression - repressed thoughts, traumatizing events, etc. Traditionally, the therapist talks with his client until the client brings up a memory that evokes these negative feelings. AS SOON as the client makes note of their traumatic feelings, the therapist engages them in EMDR - in my experience, he moved his finger left to right, instructing me to follow his finger as I think back and try to get an image in my head of what had occurred in my life to cause the trauma, and to face the traumatic triggers head on.\n\nIt is a **very intense and emotional experience** that can be life-changing. I would only ever send this tool to somebody who has been taught how to properly and effectively use EMDR, but even then, I would approach it with caution and only if somebody is in a crisis.\n\nDoes that mean this tool should be removed? **No.** Of course it shouldn't. It's a simple code that moves a square left to right. That's all it is, if you look at it. It would be but a shitty screensaver if it weren't for the EMDR information tacked onto the page before it.\n\nThe site is a tool. It's not a bad tool, nor is it the most effective tool in treating anxiety, depression or PTSD, but I don't think that's what OP is going for. This is not a replacement for therapy.

EMDR is a fast and effective way to resolve PTSD as well as other problems like self esteem issues, depression or anxiety.  I am concerned about this tool preventing people from getting the treatment they need.  I truly wish that EMDR could be effective in a self help application.  And for some people it can reduce upset temporarily. But EMDR is not designed to just decrase upset but to eliminate patterns of upset.  What I mean is that its not just a coping skill meant to reduce an episode but to remove the cause of upsets so that you no longer have episodes of anxiety, depression or PTSD.  For some people, who had younger or more sustained difficulty at young ages, this tool will actually escalate upset and they will not be able to reduce that upset without the help of a trained therapist.  So that is a second concern.  \n\nEMDR treatment  is only effective when the client is assisted to set up for the treatment by isolating what is at the root of the symptoms, triggering it just so and then continuing to process while receiving bilateral stimulation.  I know the technique very well but would not be able to do it on myself alone.  Triggering that level of intensity in feelings stops the person from being able to observe themselves and guide themselves through the process.  Trying to do this n your own at best will offer temporary relief, but at worst could retraumatize the user and result in weeks of escalated symptoms.  For many people it will do no good at all because they don't have any idea how to set up properly for it.  \n\nIt is not good for your daughter for you to be this over connected with your daughter, and it could be at some point she will be angry with you for your need to be with her.

She might wear earbuds and listen to music or a video game while you do the work you need to do.  Because EMDR is so rapid and effective therapy could be very brief-maybe even less than 10 sessions depending on your childhood experiences/mental health. You can look for trained EMDR therapists on Psychology today's directory.  Just make sure that the therapist uses the technique with most of their patients.  lots of people advertise EMDR training but never figured out how to really do it and only use it with the simplest cases.  \n\nTo the creators of the tool.

And worst still lots of people will gain no benefit at all and think EMDR is crap. It sounds like you are doing self tapping to manage your symptoms.  Self tapping is when you are triggered tapping back and forth on your knees or in your case moving your eyes back and forth till the feeling goes down.  Its very important that people not try to tap to 0.  You will never get there.

Let me explain how I feel about this.\n\nEMDR is a very valid therapeutic tool used for those suffering from symptoms related to PTSD, anxiety and depression - repressed thoughts, traumatizing events, etc. Traditionally, the therapist talks with his client until the client brings up a memory that evokes these negative feelings. AS SOON as the client makes note of their traumatic feelings, the therapist engages them in EMDR - in my experience, he moved his finger left to right, instructing me to follow his finger as I think back and try to get an image in my head of what had occurred in my life to cause the trauma, and to face the traumatic triggers head on.\n\nIt is a **very intense and emotional experience** that can be life-changing. I would only ever send this tool to somebody who has been taught how to properly and effectively use EMDR, but even then, I would approach it with caution and only if somebody is in a crisis.\n\nDoes that mean this tool should be removed? **No.** Of course it shouldn't. It's a simple code that moves a square left to right. That's all it is, if you look at it. It would be but a shitty screensaver if it weren't for the EMDR information tacked onto the page before it.\n\nThe site is a tool. It's not a bad tool, nor is it the most effective tool in treating anxiety, depression or PTSD, but I don't think that's what OP is going for. This is not a replacement for therapy.

A key part of the therapy was the guidance of the therapist who, after each period of alternating stimulation (in my case, her hand was waved from side to side for my eyes to track while my head remained stationary) she would ask me what came to mind and where my thoughts went, then she would point out the key thoughts / memories to focus on during the next wave of alternation.\n\nWithout the guidance of the therapist, I would have surely dismissed EMDR as ineffective nonsense.

Sure, you can definitely get jams just by people driving like asshats, but in major cities it is not caused by not leaving a gigantic gap so that you \"eat the wave\", nor is it caused by \"cheaters\" (WTF is a cheater?!).\n\nMost traffic jams are caused by insufficient road capacity. If you try to jam more cars on the road than the road was designed for, traffic *will* move slower to accommodate that. It has to. You still have entrance and exit ramps, you still have people merging across the highway to get on and off, there *will* be ripples and there *will* be a reduction in speed. If you hold open an artificially large gap, there are no cars on that pavement for a period of time, and you have artificially, temporarily, reduced the capacity of the road.\n\nWhen it comes to merges, there's really no such thing as a \"cheater\". The proper way to merge is to go to the end of the lane, and zipper. One car from the ending lane, one car from the through lane, and back and forth. Cars that hold up traffic to force merging before the lane actually ends, if you truly think about it, *force* the merge point to be earlier. Then in order to avoid \"cheating\" you must merge even *earlier*.  Fewer lanes means less capacity and less capacity means slower speeds when the highway is already at or over capacity. Period.\n\nI see this every day on my drive to and from work. There's some big truck clogging up the left lane going 60 in a 65, just because the lane next to him is going 58 MPH.

I'm proof of it, I caught up to him! And magically he finds the accelerator when I try to use a break in traffic in the middle lane to pass. It's jerks like these that make overcapacity highways and jams worse than they have to be. Highway patrol doesn't care.

But driving up to speed *when there is no traffic* will help prevent it in the first place. Driving faster means less time on the road. Less time on the road means less cars on the road on average. *But*, more importantly, we just need *smarter* drivers who don't break every 10 seconds, enter the highway at 30mph, know how to merge/zipper/yield...", "id": "d3uiaae"}, {"comment": "The effect I am talking about can be demonstrated in the simulator by turning up the \"comf deceleration\" parameter. People rush ahead just to come to a complete stop, instead of approaching traffic at a cautious speed. \n\nLooking ahead and anticipating any kind of change, actually, can reduce the need to stop. Unexpected lane closure, accidents, debris, all can cause people to stop abruptly.\n\nEDIT: But I can see what you mean about the need to accelerate once traffic has cleared. Unfortunately the cost of accelerating prematurely is perpetuation of the jam. Sometimes you think the jam has cleared but there is more around the corner. I think a simple digital HUD and warning system would vastly improve driving conditions, without the need for full automation.

And the next pack has the same thing. And so on and so forth. If those people would obey the \"Slower traffic keep right\" signs, this type of artificial traffic jam wouldn't exist.\n\nThen there's also the case when lanes end, and there's little you can do when the 4 lane highway was at capacity and now drops to 3 lanes. You simply can't fit a whole extra lane of cars into one fewer and expect traffic to continue at speed. In this situation, no amount of tricks will prevent or resolve the traffic jam.

We thought it was a cool way of intuitively exploring watersheds and we are excited by how many of you share our enthusiasm!\n\n**Why we made the app**\nThe idea for this started off as a conversation that we had with a client who wanted precipitation data for the full area that drained into a location of interest. We solved that problem for that one location, but were interested in doing this generally for the entire US since it seemed like a fun and interesting problem. Mark flat out ran with it.\n\nWhat started as a question of hydrologic interconnectedness soon turned into algorithmic network traversal to trace any arbitrary series of sub-watersheds from end to end using the [US Geological Survey's Watershed Boundary Dataset]( http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html) soon turned into figuring out how to work around data issues soon turned into figuring out how we could show the 100,000+ boundary polygons in a web browser without your browser crashing, etc. It's been a journey that Mark himself can tell you [much more eloquently than I can (and with supporting visuals!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieGFbsFkIFE#t=6h24m18s).\n\n**Hug of Death**\nAs some discussion in here speculates, the app indeed got a lot more attention than we were expecting. We shared it with some friends and family over the past few weeks and it got maybe 50 views *total*. Then Mark showed it at !!Con in New York this past Saturday (the YouTube link above is his talk) and it hit 450 views on Saturday alone. On Sunday, views reached just shy of 61,000. For those of you who are hip to AWS, the polygon set (about 45mb) was being served from a t2.micro along with the app code. By Sunday evening, the t2.micro outgoing bandwidth had capped, so that night we moved the polygon set over to CloudFront. In the next 12 hours, that 45mb polygon set - that is only used when you use the app on a desktop - had accounted for almost a half terabyte of data transfer out. We went ahead and moved all remaining static assets into a combination of CloudFront and S3 and rewrote parts of the app to be more scalable. [This](http://i.imgur.com/SCaPS.gif) is a pretty accurate representation of us on Sunday night.\n \ntl;dr We expected a few hundred people to use the app when a few hundred thousand showed up. We've reengineered how we made it so that hopefully you won't see the delays that were happening during the period between the start of the Hug of Death and when we made it more scalable.\n\n**What's next**\nWe're planning to write up a blog post that will go into some of the cool things we've seen using it, some detail about the processing making this required, and some of the challenges we faced with translating the dataset to a web context (and the resulting strangeness that can sometimes occur). We are working on other similarly interesting projects that will be posted on [our website](http://fernleafinteractive.com) soon if you want to check back in with us there.

If you have a topographic map, you can follow contours uphill from the point of interest (e.g. River mouth) until you reach a point where it starts going downhill again and add a dot. You keep doing this until you've worked yourself ask the way around and can play \"connect the dots.\" You'll have a watershed.  It's also super annoying.\n\n\nIn GIS (fancy computer mapping) you generally use a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). A DEM is an image where each pixel represents an area on the ground (commonly a 10m area). The difference between a DEM and an aerial image is that instead of representing light reflectance, the brightness of the pixels represent elevation.\n\nSo you take the DEMs in the area you're interested in, and you process the shit out of them. The first thing you do is fill \"holes\" in the dataset where everything drains to a central point (think retention ponds). These holes will eventually be filled in a flood of big enough proportions, so you fill them in digitally.\n\nYou also calculate each pixel's Aspect. That is, you compare each pixel to the surrounding 8 pixels at figure out which is lowest. That gives you a direction of flow for each pixel.\n\nHere's where it starts getting awesome.\n\nYou then calculate accumulation. You sum up the cumulative number of pixels that drain to every pixel.  Since it's cumulative, if you have pixel that's being drained to by 4 pixels, and it drains to a fifth, that fifth pixel will receive the total value of all pixels draining to it and all the pixels draining to those pixels.\n\nIf you run an accumulation process, the visual output is a map rivers and streams. It's pretty awesome.\n\nA watershed is then calculated by simply running the accumulation process in reverse. It consists of every pixel used for the accumulation value for whichever pixel you're interested in as the zero point for the watershed.\n\nThe whole process generally takes a few minutes if you've built a proper model.  If you're really interested, I can make a video of how it's done from start to finish.", "id": "d2y0sqs"}, {"comment": "Yes please!", "id": "d2y9yti"}, {"comment": "What about The Great Basin?

We thought it was a cool way of intuitively exploring watersheds and we are excited by how many of you share our enthusiasm!\n\n**Why we made the app**\nThe idea for this started off as a conversation that we had with a client who wanted precipitation data for the full area that drained into a location of interest. We solved that problem for that one location, but were interested in doing this generally for the entire US since it seemed like a fun and interesting problem. Mark flat out ran with it.\n\nWhat started as a question of hydrologic interconnectedness soon turned into algorithmic network traversal to trace any arbitrary series of sub-watersheds from end to end using the [US Geological Survey's Watershed Boundary Dataset]( http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html) soon turned into figuring out how to work around data issues soon turned into figuring out how we could show the 100,000+ boundary polygons in a web browser without your browser crashing, etc. It's been a journey that Mark himself can tell you [much more eloquently than I can (and with supporting visuals!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieGFbsFkIFE#t=6h24m18s).\n\n**Hug of Death**\nAs some discussion in here speculates, the app indeed got a lot more attention than we were expecting. We shared it with some friends and family over the past few weeks and it got maybe 50 views *total*. Then Mark showed it at !!Con in New York this past Saturday (the YouTube link above is his talk) and it hit 450 views on Saturday alone. On Sunday, views reached just shy of 61,000. For those of you who are hip to AWS, the polygon set (about 45mb) was being served from a t2.micro along with the app code. By Sunday evening, the t2.micro outgoing bandwidth had capped, so that night we moved the polygon set over to CloudFront. In the next 12 hours, that 45mb polygon set - that is only used when you use the app on a desktop - had accounted for almost a half terabyte of data transfer out. We went ahead and moved all remaining static assets into a combination of CloudFront and S3 and rewrote parts of the app to be more scalable. [This](http://i.imgur.com/SCaPS.gif) is a pretty accurate representation of us on Sunday night.\n \ntl;dr We expected a few hundred people to use the app when a few hundred thousand showed up. We've reengineered how we made it so that hopefully you won't see the delays that were happening during the period between the start of the Hug of Death and when we made it more scalable.\n\n**What's next**\nWe're planning to write up a blog post that will go into some of the cool things we've seen using it, some detail about the processing making this required, and some of the challenges we faced with translating the dataset to a web context (and the resulting strangeness that can sometimes occur). We are working on other similarly interesting projects that will be posted on [our website](http://fernleafinteractive.com) soon if you want to check back in with us there.

Link flair is used by moderators for many different things, such as content filters, title clarifications, \"humorous\" commentary, or as in this case, GIANT BOLD WARNINGS. Moderators cannot change titles, so they use link flair. In this case, the link flair we picked recommends you check the comment section of this post because there may be something important in there. Like a comment. An important comment that you should see.  \n  \n* **NSFW**: most of you pervs are probably familiar with this tag. It means, \"not safe for work.\" When something on the internet is not safe for a workplace, it's either porn, looks like porn, or it will make IT mad at you. In this case, IT may get mad at you, so....we marked it as not safe for work.  \n  \n* **ruin:** *noun*  ru\u00b7in \\\u02c8r\u00fc-\u0259n, -\u02ccin; \u02c8r\u00fcn\\  1: a state of complete destruction; 2: a state of being ruined; 3: the remaining pieces of something that was destroyed; 4: the state of having lost money, social status, etc. **this word is in the title of the post TWICE**  \n  \n* **illegal** *adjective*  il\u00b7le\u00b7gal \\(\u02cc)i(l)-\u02c8l\u0113-g\u0259l\\ 1: not allowed by the law: not legal; 2: not allowed by the rules in a game; **internet searches are not illegal. if you are not a terrorist, then you have no reason to worry about one Google search about ISIS.

BUT, then they have to *inadvertently* click the search button on the site, AND *inadvertently* sit there, mouth agape, synapses locked up, staring dead-eyed at the screen as the automated searches get more and more provocative.  \n  \nNow, that doesn't sound like it could be that common, for people to *inadvertently* go through all those steps, right? I also believe that if you were smart enough to find reddit, make an account, click \"Yes, I am over 18\" in order to see NSFW links, and browse the front page instead of just /r/braveryjerk or whatever other dumbass sub mouthbreathers are into these days, then you're smart enough to see, read, comprehend, and act in accordance with the various warnings we gave (delineated above, in the terms and definitions section).  \n  \n\nSo where does that leave us?

This site will for real fuck up your Google search history with tons of searches, some of them are distasteful or might get you on a list somewhere.  \n  \nThe site functions as advertised. There's a NSFW tag, a flair, and now this comment to warn you. Proceed at your own risk etc.   \n  \n____  \n  \n#**EDIT FOR REAL TALK YO**  \n  \n____  \n  \nFirstly, please join me in wishing /u/NorseFenrir a happy birthday! He's very near and dear to many of our hearts, and we wish him all the best on the anniversary of his parents realizing the full consequences of unprotected sex.  \n  \nWith that out of the way, I'd like to address a number of your replies all at once here, so we can have one big fat examination of personal responsibility in the context of reddit (and other parts of the internet, for those who have not fully converted yet).    \n  \nI think it'd be prudent to start with a few definitions and the meanings of a few key phrases in this situation:  \n  \n* **SEE COMMENTS**: this is what we call a \"link flair\". Link flair is used by moderators for many different things, such as content filters, title clarifications, \"humorous\" commentary, or as in this case, GIANT BOLD WARNINGS. Moderators cannot change titles, so they use link flair. In this case, the link flair we picked recommends you check the comment section of this post because there may be something important in there. Like a comment. An important comment that you should see.  \n  \n* **NSFW**: most of you pervs are probably familiar with this tag. It means, \"not safe for work.\" When something on the internet is not safe for a workplace, it's either porn, looks like porn, or it will make IT mad at you. In this case, IT may get mad at you, so....we marked it as not safe for work.  \n  \n* **ruin:** *noun*  ru\u00b7in \\\u02c8r\u00fc-\u0259n, -\u02ccin; \u02c8r\u00fcn\\  1: a state of complete destruction; 2: a state of being ruined; 3: the remaining pieces of something that was destroyed; 4: the state of having lost money, social status, etc. **this word is in the title of the post TWICE**  \n  \n* **illegal** *adjective*  il\u00b7le\u00b7gal \\(\u02cc)i(l)-\u02c8l\u0113-g\u0259l\\ 1: not allowed by the law: not legal; 2: not allowed by the rules in a game; **internet searches are not illegal. if you are not a terrorist, then you have no reason to worry about one Google search about ISIS. I promise. You can trust me. I'm a lawyer.**  \n  \nAlright, so that part's done. Many of you are of the opinion that it is irresponsible for us, as the moderators of /r/InternetIsBeautiful, to keep this link visible on our subreddit and, by way of its popularity, /r/all. While we appreciate and acknowledge your opinion on the matter, we respectfully disagree with it. We've taken adequate steps to warn redditors that this link might be something you shouldn't just blindly click. Maybe like read the comments or something.  \n  \nYes, this is a default subscription when you create a reddit account; yes, that means that we must consider that many people who might see this link are not the most experienced internet users; yes, that also means that there are people, many of them I'm sure, who may inadvertently click this link. BUT, then they have to *inadvertently* click the search button on the site, AND *inadvertently* sit there, mouth agape, synapses locked up, staring dead-eyed at the screen as the automated searches get more and more provocative.  \n  \nNow, that doesn't sound like it could be that common, for people to *inadvertently* go through all those steps, right? I also believe that if you were smart enough to find reddit, make an account, click \"Yes, I am over 18\" in order to see NSFW links, and browse the front page instead of just /r/braveryjerk or whatever other dumbass sub mouthbreathers are into these days, then you're smart enough to see, read, comprehend, and act in accordance with the various warnings we gave (delineated above, in the terms and definitions section).  \n  \n\nSo where does that leave us? Well, we're gonna leave this post up. You're gonna leave mean comments after you skim this really long edit, I'm going to ignore them or give a token response, and then by the time America wakes up tomorrow morning we'll have all forgotten about this whole thing.  \n  \nI promise the NSA is not going to black bag you in your sleep (unless you are a terrorist). I promise the police are not calling a judge off his poker game tonight to obtain an emergency search warrant for your apartment (unless you are a terrorist or a criminal). I promise this will all be okay, /r/InternetIsBeautiful will go back to being the mousey cousin of the default subreddits by tomorrow afternoon. And I promise you'll go back to seeing a bunch of weird shit from /r/The_Donald or unfunny metajokes from /r/HighQualityGifs on the front page in no time.  \n  \nIf you would like to discuss any of this, or like fantasy football advice, beer, music, dank memes, Ron Paul, science shit, etc., you're always welcome to [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FInternetIsBeautiful).

I look now at what I wrote below and think \"chill out bro\". I am passionate about cellular automata you see :P\n\nOLD STUFF: \"the original\" is a strange thing to say, depending on your view of mathematics.\n\nIf G is a group and A is a finite set equipped with the discrete topology, then we can give the set A^G (all set functions from G to A) the product topology. We can then define a left-action of G on A^G by\n\ngx(h) = x(g^(-1)h)\n\nwhere x is in A^G and g,h in G.\n\nCall a function f:A^G -> A^G G-equivariant if it commutes with the action defined above, i.e. if for all g in G and x in A^G we have \n\ngf(x) = f(gx).\n\nThen cellular automata can be defined as exactly the continuous G-equivariant maps from A^G to itself. Phrased this way, I would say \"original\" doesn't mean much.\n\nTo put it more plainly, the most obvious cellular automaton is the one which does nothing, the identity map A^G ->A^G which takes x to itself.

It's clear that you lack rigour. Classic failure of character.  \n\nI'm sure you know how a smoke detector/alarm works, right? If you do, skip the next paragraph.  \n\nIf you don't, they're a basic type of what is known as a beta attenuation detector. In simple terms the operating principle is that the decay of radioactive nuclides produces a stream of particles that passes through an air gap. Normally, in the absence of particulate matter in the air, you get very little attenuation (absorption) of the beam, and the detector signal remains constant. When there's smoke in the air, smoke particles absorb some of these particles and the resulting drop in signal intensity is what triggers the smoke alarm. (Actually, the way such smoke detectors work is more complicated and very different [search up am-241 smoke detector], but this simplified&modified explanation is more than enough as context.)  \n\nLet's take a look at the \"radiation source\". It contains an amount of radioactive substance. When an atom of this radioactive substance undergoes what is known as radioactive decay, two things happen. One, it emits a single beta particle. (Actually more things happen [nuclear state transitions, neutrino emission, etc], but these aren't very relevant to our discussion, nor will you understand them anyway) Two, the radioactive atom decays into another one. This means that as time goes on, there is less and less of that particular radioactive isotope left over, and your smoke detector will eventually need replacement. We can ask the following question: how long before I have no more of that particular type of atom?  \n\nLet's take for example 14C. 14C has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. For reasons beyond both the scope of this discussion and you, 14C is not stable - it undergoes radioactive decay. It emits a beta particle, and turns into 14N (7 protons, 7 neutrons). Again this means that with each beta particle emitted, there is one less atom of 14C. 14C has a well known half-life of around 6000 years (iirc, go search if you're interested). The half-life, put simply, is the time period after which you will only be left with half of what you originally had.  \n\nSo what happens when you're down to the last atom of 14C? After one half-life, will you be left with half of an atom of 14C? That's not possible.  \n\nSo when will this atom of 14C decay?  \n\nNobody can predict this. It is completely random. Not random as in \"i threw a dice, which side will end up facing upwads?\" random. You don't know which side of a dice will end up facing upwards because of a lack of information - had you known the velocity, position, forces, bulk moduli, coefficients of friction, <...> of the dice and the table it's being thrown onto, you'd be able to predict with great accuracy the outcome of the dice roll. But as for when a single atom of 14C (or any radionuclide for that matter) will decay? Even with perfect information (knowing the wavefunction describing that system of 6 protons, 8 neutrons, and 6 electrons, and hence every relevant eigenvalue/eigenvector of the wavefunction), you would still be unable to predict when an atom of 14C would decay.", "id": "d9i73i1"}, {"comment": "Huh.

Learning C++ properly also requires learning how a lot of the things it does work under the hood.  I'd strongly recommend looking up proper reference material on this.  \n\nIf you can stand his writing, Stroustrup's book on it (he's the creator of the language) teaches not only the language and how it actually functions, but it also is a great perspective on the design philosophy. It's hilariously arrogant in its presentation, but it's probably the best way to get a foundation in the language.  \n\nHonestly though, I'd take a further step back and start with C.  I think the best way to really understand C++ properly is to start with that as a foundation.  Again, the creator of C has a fantastic book on it that lacks the arrogance of Stroustrup's book, which I think is the best way to learn C. \n\nFor a TL:DR as to why I recommend this, it basically comes down to properly handling memory management, jumps, function overhead, and object handling (specifically when to use and not to use inheritance in C++).  If you are ever writing code in C or C++, it should be important enough to do it right; else you shouldn't bother putting up with the frustration of dealing with code on that low of a level.  By jumping to these languages, you are going beyond the level of achieving functionality and looking for true speed you don't get from relying on the free convenience of higher-level languages.  \n\nSure, you can write code in C/C++ without learning this stuff, but there's no point if you don't also have the knowledge critical to making good design and implementation decisions.  \n\nHope that makes sense.

Well, it sounds like there is a mismatch between how we describe our disgust, and how intense that disgust actually is:\n\n>Political ideologies summarize dimensions of life that define how a person organizes their public and private behavior, including their attitudes associated with sex, family, education, and personal autonomy [ 1, 2 ]. Despite the abstract nature of such sensibilities, fundamental features of political ideology have been found to be deeply connected to basic biological mechanisms [ 3\u20137 ] that may serve to defend against environmental challenges like contamination and physical threat [ 8\u201312 ]. These results invite the provocative claim that neural responses to nonpolitical stimuli (like contaminated food or physical threats) should be highly predictive of abstract political opinions (like attitudes toward gun control and abortion) [ 13 ]. We applied a machine-learning method to fMRI data to test the hypotheses that brain responses to emotionally evocative images predict individual scores on a standard political ideology assay. **Disgusting images, especially those related to animal-reminder disgust (e.g., mutilated body), generate neural responses that are highly predictive of political orientation even though these neural predictors do not agree with participants\u2019 conscious rating of the stimuli.** Images from other affective categories do not support such predictions. Remarkably, brain responses to a single disgusting stimulus were sufficient to make accurate predictions about an individual subject\u2019s political ideology. These results provide strong support for the idea that fundamental neural processing differences that emerge under the challenge of emotionally evocative stimuli may serve to structure political beliefs in ways formerly unappreciated.\n\nBasically, my \"moderate disgust\" may be as intense are your \"slight disgust.\" That least that is how I interpret it.\n\nSome random thoughts:\n\nMight this relate to the idea of \"urban liberals?\" Rats and the smell of urine and garbage are often city conditions.\n\nFood has a lot of cultural baggage. \"How do *those* people eat *that*??\" could be said by a Euro American looking at Chinese food, or a person from one pizza region looking at another region's style of pizza. At least in the USA, I think younger people have had more exposure to and are maybe more open to eating strange foods or food outside their culture.\n\nExposure to lab science, science education, or medical could influence some of this stuff. I know that cold viruses can survive outside the body long enough for the cook in the kitchen to maybe infect me. I've touched dead humans and dead animals. I work with insects and find maggots interesting, not gross.\n\nAlso... are conservative ladies the ones pissing on women's toilet seats because they have to hover?"], [74, "So apparently I'm 74% Republican because I don't like seeing dead bodies and intestines and eating soup stirred by \"clean\" flyswatters and walking through graveyards and think that ketchup on vanilla ice cream is extremely disgusting...shitty questionairre"], [71, "80% democrat --> completely Libertarian \n\nNo one ever considers the third party.

Well, it sounds like there is a mismatch between how we describe our disgust, and how intense that disgust actually is:\n\n>Political ideologies summarize dimensions of life that define how a person organizes their public and private behavior, including their attitudes associated with sex, family, education, and personal autonomy [ 1, 2 ]. Despite the abstract nature of such sensibilities, fundamental features of political ideology have been found to be deeply connected to basic biological mechanisms [ 3\u20137 ] that may serve to defend against environmental challenges like contamination and physical threat [ 8\u201312 ]. These results invite the provocative claim that neural responses to nonpolitical stimuli (like contaminated food or physical threats) should be highly predictive of abstract political opinions (like attitudes toward gun control and abortion) [ 13 ]. We applied a machine-learning method to fMRI data to test the hypotheses that brain responses to emotionally evocative images predict individual scores on a standard political ideology assay. **Disgusting images, especially those related to animal-reminder disgust (e.g., mutilated body), generate neural responses that are highly predictive of political orientation even though these neural predictors do not agree with participants\u2019 conscious rating of the stimuli.** Images from other affective categories do not support such predictions. Remarkably, brain responses to a single disgusting stimulus were sufficient to make accurate predictions about an individual subject\u2019s political ideology. These results provide strong support for the idea that fundamental neural processing differences that emerge under the challenge of emotionally evocative stimuli may serve to structure political beliefs in ways formerly unappreciated.\n\nBasically, my \"moderate disgust\" may be as intense are your \"slight disgust.\" That least that is how I interpret it.\n\nSome random thoughts:\n\nMight this relate to the idea of \"urban liberals?\" Rats and the smell of urine and garbage are often city conditions.\n\nFood has a lot of cultural baggage. \"How do *those* people eat *that*??\" could be said by a Euro American looking at Chinese food, or a person from one pizza region looking at another region's style of pizza. At least in the USA, I think younger people have had more exposure to and are maybe more open to eating strange foods or food outside their culture.\n\nExposure to lab science, science education, or medical could influence some of this stuff. I know that cold viruses can survive outside the body long enough for the cook in the kitchen to maybe infect me. I've touched dead humans and dead animals.

A second awesome addition would be a very simple land/water map with a slightly larger board.

Right now, the color channels are identical processes so you're basically running the same evolution three times or, put another way, you're creating randomness by generating three random numbers instead of just one.

I was thinking that a red species and a blue species wouldn't combine to make purple, one would outcompete the other. The only reason I think that is because I'm used to standard Earth biology but there's no reason a simulation of evolution needs to be earthly!\n\nSo scrap all those thoughts and start with the first two ideas. Since the whole point of a simulation is for us to actually see and comprehend the results, color and competition can remain arbitrary but visible.\n\nYour current simulation acts like a dice roll. You pick up all the dice, roll them, and put them out wherever they land. Your survivors never overlap with breeders given the population size you're using, which is a kind of useless factor overall (it's like counting non-voters in an election).\n\nInstead of that, I'd try to find a way to breed each individual square by averaging out nearby squares. This would still end up with the same results overall, with the ultimate balance relying on the amount of chaos in your equations, but it would allow for further development of the board itself.\n\nThe first simple influencer, as I mentioned, would be basic land and impassable water squares. These would slow the rate of evolution by forcing a longer path (or no path) between one square of the board to any other.\n\nTaking that idea further, you could add a very basic and random erosion process which drops one square into the sea and raises another out somewhere else. This would slowly bring isolated colonies into contact and create bleed between them.\n\nAnother simple step, without altering your extremely simple evolution equation, would be to create a randomly occurring natural disaster that temporarily destroys and blackens land squares, creating isolated species that evolve separately until squares become passable again.\n\nOverall, mutating basic terrain might be more fun to watch.\n\nThat still leaves a few imperfections to the simple simulation of life. The first of these is that any species can breed with any other. Perhaps you might establish a breeding gap such that the chance of breeding decreases as the difference in genes between squares increases. When two isolated colonies come into contact, they might remain almost entirely homogeneous for a longer period of time (which makes the evolution more visually apparent at the pace of the simulation).\n\nAnother absence is the lack of branching once the board assumes the same color and the strange cycling of colors that constantly carries on. Maybe the land itself could be given pockets of increased vegetation near the coastlines which would grow in and out of the continent, bringing species in and out of contact with each other for period of time.

However, there are a few that are genetically different from the rest due to mutations, and they are not killed by the antibiotic.\n4. Those few remaining bacteria reproduce like crazy.\n5. You now have a ton of bacteria which are mostly immune to the antibiotic.\n\nSecondly, I'm not trying to say that camouflage is necessary for every kind of animal. It is useful for many predatory or prey animals, but not always necessary.\n\nThirdly, pandas are dying out because they can't adapt to human activity fast enough. Genetic mutation happens all the time, but evolution in large animals has a hard time adjusting to conditions that change too rapidly. A single species going extinct does *NOT* disprove evolution in any way.\n\nFourthly, I'm not saying every evolutionary change takes billions of years. I meant that very dramatic evolutionary changes take a long time, and you wouldn't see it happening in real time.\n\nFifth, I did *NOT* say there were infinite colors of moths. That is a preposterous scenario! The moths would also *not* need to consciously \"decide\" to blend in. Those specific moths were likely similarly colored to the tree, and the ones who sat on trees with similar coloration would be the most likely to survive. This would cause the moths to evolve a tendency to sit on materials with similar coloration, because the ones who do don't get eaten as often. Additionally, moths who had more speckled coloration would additionally survive more often, because they blend in with the trees even better.\n\nNot to mention, those moths evolved in an area with many birch trees. There were likely fewer maple and walnut trees. But the other tree species are irrelevant, because the moths have an ecological niche that they adapted to. It would make no sense to move to other trees, because they are camouflaged to the birch trees so well, unlike the other trees.\n\nThe other insects in that area survived, because they had other ways to avoid being eaten. Not EVERY organism that isn't camouflaged is going to be eaten. My simulation is oversimplified. Camouflage is not *needed*, but it helped the moths reproduce more successfully.\n\nSixth, this \"picasso\" scenario is a preposterous strawman. If you just dump a few thousand moths into a room with some paintings, and add in predators to eat them, they'll almost certainly die out. Individual organisms do not evolve, populations do. It doesn't matter how short a moth's lifespan is. If there was a large environment full of moths, and you gradually introduced paintings over an extended timespan, it's possible for them to eventually camouflage with the paintings. Evolution does NOT take place with a single generation. Just look at how many generations it takes for my simulated organisms to evolve, even with a very high mutation rate!\n\nSeventh, the utilization of technology doesn't in any way disprove evolution. Other animal species don't wear clothing, primarily because they tend not to stray far from their native habitats. Humans are native to the plains of Africa, but we travel around the world. We evolved for a warm, tropical climate, which is why we have little insulating fur on our bodies. (A popular theory about it is that human hunters would be able to chase prey for extended durations, until the animal passed out from heat exhaustion due to having fur. This is a technique employed by some African tribes today.) Human technology like clothing, tools, vehicles, agriculture, etc. are all products of some of our best adaptations: Our brains, which allow us to invent/create, our hands, which let us manipulate objects easily, and our tribal tendencies, which allow us to work together as a species and spread across the world.\n\nA squirrel has to do *lots* of things to survive.

Humans didn't evolve for that kind of environment, but can still thrive (like the Native Americans). If you take some random guy who grew up in NYC and throw him in a forest, of *course* he'll have a hard time, because he's used to living in a city and working together with other humans to benefit everyone.\n\nSo much for your bullshit strawman arguments and \"intelligent design\"\n\n", "id": "d62sgxg"}, {"comment": "> I believe that God created us by writing instructions on/ in dna\n\nThat was your queue to stop arguing.", "id": "d62ub0f"}, {"comment": ">chimp human abominations crawling out of the sea\n\n>People fight this for some bizarre reason and start making up ridiculous and implausible theories of monkey men and ape descendents and sea slugs crawling out of the ocean and mutating into humans.\n\nYou have proven that you really have no idea how evolution works.

This average occurs both towards and away from your target I assume. This also gives us a value of 5.325 points of change per channel exclusively for mutated individuals (and 0 for the healthy ones).\n\n> The board is 40x40 organisms in size, meaning there are a total of 1,600 organisms in play. Removing the 30 best organisms leaves 1570 organisms on the chopping block. 20% of those adds 314 survivors per generation. **Every generation of 1,600 organisms is made up of 314 \"survivors\" and 1,286 \"newborns\".**\n\nSince I suck at math, I can only walk myself through a general observable prediction of how much can change in a given iteration. Also, for simplicity, I'm going to skip out on individual alleles and pretend each organism has a single value or gene (it's three simultaneous and identical simulations really).\n\n> First off, I picture \"fitness\" as the average of a range. Oddly enough, this creates two different scenarios which, while following the same rules, don't really work well in my words. In the first situation, the entire board is random and there are 15 breeders taken from above your target and 15 from below. At a glance these would almost immediately average out to your exact target (-50 and +50 average to zero). Fortunately for the simulation, a second scenario kicks in before that can happen (I'm making this up as I go). Because only 30 breeders are chosen, the chances that the fittest individuals will be split evenly above and below the line are exceedingly small. Every single generation that does not split evenly tilts more and more towards either the high average or the low average.\n\n> You can see this second scenario playing out if you run the steps one at a time. Over the first few steps the entire board divides between two random contrasting colors (mine went purple and green) representing the above average (+50) and the below average (-50). By generation 8, there were only a few green dots left. By generation 13, there were none.\n\n> This whole situation is simplified nicely by the absolute command which turns -50 into +50 (I only just remembered it was there, so this comment is for my benefit). What's more, it means that we can adjust the target to represent zero for any situation.\n\n> * 1,286 organisms will be randomly dispersed between the best and worst values of the 30 breeders (average breeder fitness).\n> * 314 organisms will be randomly dispersed between the previous best and worst values of the last generation.\n> * 158.4 organisms will mutate by 1 - 10 points. (127.314 will be newborn, 31.086 will be survivors).\n> * 1.6 organisms will mutate by 1 - 75 points. (1.286 will be newborn, 0.314 will be survivors).\n\n> We will assume that the target is zero, the fitness of the breeders is 50, and the fitness of the previous generation is (arbitrarily) 60.\n\n> To orient the problem, **if there were no mutations** the average fitness of the new generation would be (1286x50 + 314x60) / 1600 = **51.96**. This value represents the next generation's survivors. What I can't account for is the best values within that average which are carried forward by the breeders.\n\n> **No mutations**: ((1,286 healthy newborns) x (breeder fitness)) + ((314 healthy survivors) x (old generation fitness)) / 1,600 total organisms **=** new generation fitness.\n\nThe affect of mutations and the value of breeders is something that requires a bit more math than I have at my command. What I can point out as evident is the affect of constant numbers in an equation like this.\n\n> * The first constant number is **the population size** (1600). If there were 50 billion organisms, random chance would produce at least 30 nearly perfect individuals. If, instead, there were only 50 organisms, random chance would spread out the 30 best over most of the available range. If there were 31 individuals, you would only be scrapping the absolute worst organism each time, doing very little for evolution of the group. **Higher total population decreases the distance between breeder fitness and causes their average fitness to approach it's maximum gain per generation.**\n> * The second constant is **the number of survivors** (314). Adjusting these produces similar results. Survivors act as anchors, stealing space from the newborn population. It's important to remember that not every generation improves upon conditions, meaning that holding onto survivors would be beneficial if something went wrong. **The more survivors there are, the more the average fitness of the generation approaches that of the previous generation.**\n> * The third constant is **the number of breeders** (30). This number is interesting because, if the \"best\" was calculated subjectively, we would end up with two competing effects. An ideal evolution would take the absolute best individual and exclusively breed it. In the real world, where we can't calculate the \"best\" (if there was a margin of error in the calculation), you could end up breeding a monster across the entire population by mistake (a broken ant queen destroys the colony). With humans, almost every single individual is a potential breeder meaning that almost no values are pruned from the herd at all. In pure mathematics, though, **the fewer breeders involved, the more optimized and less diverse the next generation's newborns will be.**\n> * Two last constants are **the ratio of the mutations** (10%) and **the degree of mutation** (5.325). Mutations essentially stretch the maximum and minimum values of every single group in each generation and to increase overlap between survivors and newborns. A perfect newborn based on the best breeders could become even more perfect if it mutated in the right direction. The worst survivor, as well, could become even worse with a mutation in the right direction. Mutation is a lot like a second pass at random breeding except that it's constant values (which are independent of the current fitness) ensure that it's pace is also constant. **Mutations are more effective as the pace of breeding declines.**\n\n**So to summarize**: increasing population size increases the rate of progress; increasing the ratio of survivors slows the rate of progress; increasing the number of breeders slows the rate of progress; and increasing the ratio and degree of mutation replaces random breeding with constant mutation.\n\nBeyond that, I know that you can break down and predict the number of mutated and healthy individuals within each major group (newborns, survivors, breeders) but you'll never be able to properly account for randomness without using an unpredictable random function.\n\nI also tested 0,0,0 as a target and it was several times faster due to clamping negative values. The lowest it got was 2.95 before going up or down by about 50 points.\n\nI tried it with 128,128,128 for a slightly less generations and the lowest it got was 10.76 before bobbing between 50 and 100.

How many people are there in your family? What kind of lifestyle do you lead? What kinds of housing do you need? What limitations do you have on things like crime, pollution, personal freedoms, and quality of life? All of these inputs are used to generate custom budgets, built for you on the fly, for 600 cities around the world. The cities that don't match your parameters for filters like crime are tossed out, so you're only presented with the cities that you'd like. You can browse the site in a bunch of common currencies, and you can select almost any country as your passport country so that when you look at a city, you see what kind of visa you\u2019ll need to arrange for, too. \n \nOne interesting experiment is an attempt to quantify and filter on racial discrimination based on survey responses from the World Values Survey. This same approach was used by some Swedish economists in 2013, but I re-did some of the same work and corrected some of the data errors in the source data that caused them some headaches in the media.\n\nThe site\u2019s primary data sources are Numbeo, UN reports, Wikipedia, Freedom House, the World Bank, and the World Values Survey. About 5% of the cities have original editorial articles, and that number is going up as I have time to write new ones.\n\nAll of the data is updated automatically as often as appropriate-- the cost of live, currency exchange rates, and quality of life are updated nightly. Some other info, like population or human rights, is updated on a monthly or annual basis (if it's based on an annual report). The budgets are all editable on a line-item level and downloadable from the Budgets tab of each city as a CSV for later editing.\n\nThe goal of the site is to help students, retirees, workers, and anyone else wanting to go live abroad long term find the right place at the right price for them, and to arm them with the best and most up to date knowledge I can.\n\nSomeday soon, you\u2019ll be able to create an account and save your edits to the budgets so that you can use your own line item budget in the search and when sharing with others.

How many people are there in your family? What kind of lifestyle do you lead? What kinds of housing do you need? What limitations do you have on things like crime, pollution, personal freedoms, and quality of life? All of these inputs are used to generate custom budgets, built for you on the fly, for 600 cities around the world. The cities that don't match your parameters for filters like crime are tossed out, so you're only presented with the cities that you'd like. You can browse the site in a bunch of common currencies, and you can select almost any country as your passport country so that when you look at a city, you see what kind of visa you\u2019ll need to arrange for, too. \n \nOne interesting experiment is an attempt to quantify and filter on racial discrimination based on survey responses from the World Values Survey. This same approach was used by some Swedish economists in 2013, but I re-did some of the same work and corrected some of the data errors in the source data that caused them some headaches in the media.\n\nThe site\u2019s primary data sources are Numbeo, UN reports, Wikipedia, Freedom House, the World Bank, and the World Values Survey. About 5% of the cities have original editorial articles, and that number is going up as I have time to write new ones.\n\nAll of the data is updated automatically as often as appropriate-- the cost of live, currency exchange rates, and quality of life are updated nightly. Some other info, like population or human rights, is updated on a monthly or annual basis (if it's based on an annual report). The budgets are all editable on a line-item level and downloadable from the Budgets tab of each city as a CSV for later editing.\n\nThe goal of the site is to help students, retirees, workers, and anyone else wanting to go live abroad long term find the right place at the right price for them, and to arm them with the best and most up to date knowledge I can.\n\nSomeday soon, you\u2019ll be able to create an account and save your edits to the budgets so that you can use your own line item budget in the search and when sharing with others. You\u2019ll also be able to save your favorites, and get in touch with other aspiring expats in cities that interest you.\n\nPlease enjoy, and feedback is always welcome!", "id": "d8ooae4"}, {"comment": "Either 1 or 3 bedroom apartments.

When we are stopped at an intersection, and a large truck next to us begins to move forward, the illusion is created visually, that we are moving backwards, even tho our inner ears report no movement. Fixing on a stationary landmark, such as a tree, street light post, or building at once dispels this movement illusion.\n\nWhen stopped at a rail station, if another train comes in going in the opposite direction for a short time we might feel as if we are moving ahead, if eyes are fixed on that train. If it stops, and then moves on, once again we feel as if we are moving. But fixing on the stationary train platform exposes, dispels and very likely comparison corrects that impression of movement.  For each illusion of any these sorts there is at least one comparison correction, or more, which efficiently corrects the illusion.\n\nSimply lay a clear plastic ruler on the surface of the screen while this illusion is in play and at once the illusions are mostly corrected!!!\n\nThe basis of this illusion, which is massively seen in the OP's URL, which is very lovely BTW, shows many instances of it. As a square column moves up, the ones next to it appear to move downwards.\n\nThe upshot of all of this illusion is a general principle, that of the comparison process. Our perceptions, senses, Compare events perceived to each other to establish what's going on with events around us. Thus, if fixing on a moving vehicle next to us, we are given the illusion of motion forwards or backwards, or as in the OP's grand illusion, that some columns are moving up and some down, relative, i. e. comparatively to those around them. This is the source of the illusion, the comparison process.\n\nTo whit:\n\nhttps://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2014/03/06/opticalsensory-illusions-creativity-the-comp/\n\nAn even grander demo is that given by doing this. Most all sensation is related to a set standard. and if that standard is compared to another percept, it will note the changes by comparison accordingly.\n\nSuppose we take 3 pans of water. The middle is about 72 degrees. The right pan is 100 degrees, and thus pretty hot, relatively to our skin. The left pan is 40 degrees, compared to a standard thermometer for measurement comparison.\n\nNow, comes the fun part. Put a right hand in the hot water pan. and the left hand into the left cool water pan. Then wait a few minutes until the skin of each hand is warmed, or cooled to a sort of equilibrium. \n\nNow comes the VERY interesting part, showing the comparison process workings of our senses. Remove the hand from the cold water, and put it into the middle pan. It will feel warm, in fact rather warm, almost at once. Then remove the left hand and put the right hand into the middle water pan. It will feel COLD!!!!\n\nSo what is the middle pan, hot or cold? It's neither, because our skin receptors respond to changes in temps, and report that as warm, warmer, warmest, or cool, cooler, or coolest. They have NO absolute temp setting, just the temp of the surfaces  just under the outer layer of our skins where the temp sensing nerves are. Our senses work RELATIVE to fixed standards, which can be temporary.\n\nThose adjectives TELL us the story. The first adjectival form is the base form. The Warmest adjectival form is the superlative. But the Warm-ER and Cool-ER form is the Comparative form!! Those terms are in fact, most all comparative forms, and massively so, as we can see by reviewing how many 1000's of base forms, -er forms, and -st superlative forms can be created and used every day. Thus our language reflects how our perceptions work, by nothing less than a comparison processing of information.\n\nThis can be easily generalized as well. How this works is basically illustrated by this article.\n\nhttps://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2014/07/02/the-relativity-of-the-cortex-the-mindbrain-interface/\n\nJust HOW most all of our brain/mind higher functions work is expressed by this article, which extends Einstein's epistemology of relativity to how our brains work, largely when processing information. Comparison process.\n\nThe above illusion shows us a massive instance of comparison processing of movement via vision. Tracking any event also involves comparing that event over time, such as a bird or plane flying in the sky, or a car or person moving down a road. The eyes and visual cortex compare at ca. 200 msec. intervals and then create the apparent motion of those events. The above lovely illusion is also  massive instances of localized tracking by comparison, which creates the illusion optical there.\n\nWhat a delliciously lovely demonstration of one of the most importance processes going on in our brains! And that of most other animals as well, who use similar methods to process events, as we do:  the Comparison Process.  In this we are united with most all other life.\n\nComparison process also generates most all of our information, data and knowledge, too. It's the origin of most all of out knowledge. It's a universal, real and powerful model for understanding, working all the time in most all of our cortical sites of our brains.\n\n"], [2, "That's not an optical illusion.

When we are stopped at an intersection, and a large truck next to us begins to move forward, the illusion is created visually, that we are moving backwards, even tho our inner ears report no movement. Fixing on a stationary landmark, such as a tree, street light post, or building at once dispels this movement illusion.\n\nWhen stopped at a rail station, if another train comes in going in the opposite direction for a short time we might feel as if we are moving ahead, if eyes are fixed on that train. If it stops, and then moves on, once again we feel as if we are moving. But fixing on the stationary train platform exposes, dispels and very likely comparison corrects that impression of movement.  For each illusion of any these sorts there is at least one comparison correction, or more, which efficiently corrects the illusion.\n\nSimply lay a clear plastic ruler on the surface of the screen while this illusion is in play and at once the illusions are mostly corrected!!!\n\nThe basis of this illusion, which is massively seen in the OP's URL, which is very lovely BTW, shows many instances of it. As a square column moves up, the ones next to it appear to move downwards.\n\nThe upshot of all of this illusion is a general principle, that of the comparison process. Our perceptions, senses, Compare events perceived to each other to establish what's going on with events around us. Thus, if fixing on a moving vehicle next to us, we are given the illusion of motion forwards or backwards, or as in the OP's grand illusion, that some columns are moving up and some down, relative, i. e. comparatively to those around them. This is the source of the illusion, the comparison process.\n\nTo whit:\n\nhttps://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2014/03/06/opticalsensory-illusions-creativity-the-comp/\n\nAn even grander demo is that given by doing this. Most all sensation is related to a set standard. and if that standard is compared to another percept, it will note the changes by comparison accordingly.\n\nSuppose we take 3 pans of water. The middle is about 72 degrees. The right pan is 100 degrees, and thus pretty hot, relatively to our skin. The left pan is 40 degrees, compared to a standard thermometer for measurement comparison.\n\nNow, comes the fun part. Put a right hand in the hot water pan. and the left hand into the left cool water pan. Then wait a few minutes until the skin of each hand is warmed, or cooled to a sort of equilibrium. \n\nNow comes the VERY interesting part, showing the comparison process workings of our senses. Remove the hand from the cold water, and put it into the middle pan. It will feel warm, in fact rather warm, almost at once. Then remove the left hand and put the right hand into the middle water pan. It will feel COLD!!!!\n\nSo what is the middle pan, hot or cold? It's neither, because our skin receptors respond to changes in temps, and report that as warm, warmer, warmest, or cool, cooler, or coolest. They have NO absolute temp setting, just the temp of the surfaces  just under the outer layer of our skins where the temp sensing nerves are. Our senses work RELATIVE to fixed standards, which can be temporary.\n\nThose adjectives TELL us the story. The first adjectival form is the base form. The Warmest adjectival form is the superlative. But the Warm-ER and Cool-ER form is the Comparative form!! Those terms are in fact, most all comparative forms, and massively so, as we can see by reviewing how many 1000's of base forms, -er forms, and -st superlative forms can be created and used every day. Thus our language reflects how our perceptions work, by nothing less than a comparison processing of information.\n\nThis can be easily generalized as well. How this works is basically illustrated by this article.\n\nhttps://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2014/07/02/the-relativity-of-the-cortex-the-mindbrain-interface/\n\nJust HOW most all of our brain/mind higher functions work is expressed by this article, which extends Einstein's epistemology of relativity to how our brains work, largely when processing information. Comparison process.\n\nThe above illusion shows us a massive instance of comparison processing of movement via vision. Tracking any event also involves comparing that event over time, such as a bird or plane flying in the sky, or a car or person moving down a road. The eyes and visual cortex compare at ca. 200 msec. intervals and then create the apparent motion of those events. The above lovely illusion is also  massive instances of localized tracking by comparison, which creates the illusion optical there.\n\nWhat a delliciously lovely demonstration of one of the most importance processes going on in our brains! And that of most other animals as well, who use similar methods to process events, as we do:  the Comparison Process.  In this we are united with most all other life.\n\nComparison process also generates most all of our information, data and knowledge, too. It's the origin of most all of out knowledge. It's a universal, real and powerful model for understanding, working all the time in most all of our cortical sites of our brains.\n\n", "id": "d80buuf"}], [{"comment": "That's not an optical illusion.

It sucks to invest your data into a site for personalization and then have the rug pulled out from under you. \n\nWhile NextQueue is our app, MediaHound is our company. We built our platform \"The Entertainment Graph\" with an API that works across any app and environment, so our plan and hope is to be more like a facebook login but for media sites. \n\nIt's bold, obviously, but we think the biggest problem with entertainment apps is that it requires you to invest so much in one and then if it goes under or gets bought, or you just find a new UI you like, you lose all your data. This way you can jump from service to service, or use multiple services at the same time but share your likes and dislikes across them. \n\nSo as an example some day you might log into your cable box, a new video service, or even a social platform with your MediaHound login and get a personalized experience there, without them having to learn all about your likes and dislikes again. \n\nI hope that explains! Running a business is tough and obviously we need to make money to keep the product live (we aren't currently monetizing anything), but we think this is a good plan that lets us provide a service for both the users and our partners that is mutually beneficial, rather than just selling ads til we get big enough to sell out.", "id": "d84bcke"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the thorough reply, definitely checking it out.

So I've always postulated (of course from a layman's position with no real info or research, just a thought) that cracking the code of these animal's language would involve the thought that their world is less linear than ours.  So where human language is linear from left to right spatially and in also thought (in terms of the sequence on how we process words and language) theirs would be more of a 3D representation of thought and language.  I mean an animal that exists its entire life in motion and never staying still EVER (water) and living in a world that is up down back forth depth shallow...the processing language would have to mirror that experience or existence. If you see \"Arrival\", the movie kinda touches on this idea as the main character tries to decipher alien language and realizes that a big part of it would be understanding that their understanding of time was different from human, which led to the structure of their language...time was represented different for them.  I think for marine mammals the equivalent would their understanding of movement and space.  This MUST affect how they perceive communications and messages.

Everyone is so focused on finding intelligent life in the universe but we have it right here on Earth. Deciphering the language of dolphins (and evidence suggests they do indeed have complex language) would greatly change our perception on life and open up the possibility of communicating with extraterrestrial life as well. Cetaceans understand the spatial environment better than any creature. A being such as dolphins who can 3D map their environment through sound would logically be able to communicate with 3D pictures. That creates a huge language barrier for communication with humans. Comparing us, humans see like dolphins hear. Good space perception and poor time discrimination. Therefore, our language consisting of  chains of syllables is difficult for cetaceans to grasp. The key here is finding a middle ground 'language' that both parties can understand fairly well.\n\nWhew, quite a speech.

So the whales communicated by singing and depending on what the general mood was currently or something they were focused on would be like the chorus in a song and any other information would be in separate stanzas, but also relate back. It's a really neat idea for different forms of communication.\n\nThe story takes place on another planet that's mostly ocean and this guy brought a couple whale friends with him so he could research the speech of this other intelligent deep water \"whale\" species native to this other planet and the story is about his frustration in cracking the code with these new whales whose speech is influenced by the total darkness they live in and lack of interaction because they exist entirely at depths most creatures can't survive in.\n\nI have it in a sci-fi magazine sitting around somewhere.

Each mode has a specific pattern of different chord qualities (e.g. ionian is I=major, ii=minor, iii= minor etc.).  Now, modal mixture is when you mix the patterns of each mode together.. In other words, you could have I-ii from ionian, iv from aeolian, bii from phrygian, V from ionian.. etc.  This is where you end up with really interesting sounding chord progressions.  Plus, due to the fact that all of the modes are the same, just starting on different notes (calling a different note I, in the same collection of notes), there's almost no point in having a modes option.  They will all tend to sound like they are ionian.  For instance, make a chord progression in the \"lydian\" mode, and tell me it doesn't sound like the V chord is the I (in other words, the \"main\" chord... should sound like home).\n\nCool app, But a few tweaks would be nice.

An arpeggio is basically playing the single notes that make up a chord in succession. For instance the C Major scale has no sharps or flats so it is C D E F G A B C. An arpeggio in the C Major will play all chords where a note in C Major is used as the root, and then typically the rest of the notes that make up the chord. So if you make the arpeggio play in C Major you get C (The Root), E (the third note), and G (the Fifth note) and  then those notes will repeat at different octaves. Next this will play the next chord arpeggio which it seems to jump around a bit. Meaning it doesn't just play an arpeggio for C and then D, and the E. It also doesn't play the root third fifth arpeggios in order, it seems to jump a bit through the C major Scale. So it may play arpeggios for the following in order C, E, B, A, G , D etc...\n\nLike I said before I'm pretty much a novice at music theory, but I believe this is basically what's going on. \n\n*EDIT* As someone explained below the chord progression is decided by the roman numerals at the top of the page.

A `V` in C major is different than a `V` in D minor. Each interval has a triad you can play with it as the root. for a C major triad, you would have `C E G`. D minor triad is `D F A`. \n\nThe \"chord progression\" section allows you to select which interval you want to arpeggiate the triad of for each step. In the case of C major/ionian that would be:\n\n\n- I: `CEG` C major\n- II (ii): `DFA` D minor\n- III (iii): `EGB` E minor\n- IV: `FAC` F major\n- V: `GBD` G major\n- VI (vi): `ACE` A minor\n- VII (vii\u00b0): `BDF` B diminished\n\nA very popular progression in a major scale would be `I V VI III`.\n\nThe arpeggio style at the bottom is just the pattern for the order that notes in the current triad are played starting at 0.

It turns out every one of those noises has a fundamental frequency, how fast the air wiggles. A lower frequency sounds, well, lower, and a higher frequency we discern as a higher tone. Two different instrument playing at the same might sound very different, but they will still appear to us as the same note. This difference is called timbre, and it's how you can differentiate between flute and cellos playing the same note. This allows very different instruments to play harmoniously together.\n\nAt the highest level, this spectrum is divided into octaves. An octave is an interval between a note and another at double the frequency. This is the most basic subdivision in music. Notes that differ a number of octaves (i.e. where the frequencies are related to each other by a power of two) get the same name: a piano and a violin might both play a C, but one a lot lower than the other. Why do we do this? Well because they sound harmoniously together, as even the most tone-deaf person can hear.\n\nThe octave itself is subdivided in 12 notes, which we've named A A# B C C# D D# E F F# G G#. These are the most basic notes in western music, and they correspond to the white and black keys on the piano. You can see that after every 12 keys, the pattern repeats. Why 12? It's complicated and has a long history, but the gist is that it sounds the best. The most pleasing intervals are well represented by the 12 key system, in a way they wouldn't with more or less keys (although people do try).\n\nFrom these 12 notes scales are formed. A scale is a collection of notes that, well..., sound good together. This program only has heptatonic diatonic scales, called modes. Heptatonic means each scale has 7 notes, and practically all western music is built on this. Diatonic is related to the order of the intervals between notes. For example, the C major scale is just the notes without sharp signs starting at C: C D E F G A B. Each scale is begat from a root note. There's also a major scale rooted in D: D E F# G A B C#. The scales are defined by patterns of which notes to skip. The major scale is W W H W W W H, where W means \"take a note and skip one\" and H means \"take a note\".  The other modes have other patterns of taking and skipping notes.\n\nFor each of those seven notes there's a bunch of chords. The chords used here are simple: starting from a note, take three notes, each time skipping one in the scale we're using. So in our simple C major scale (CDEFGAB), the V chord (V = five, so on the fifth note) would be G (skip A) B (loop around, skip C) D, so GBD. This pattern can be repeated, going up an octave (6 notes: GBDGBD). An arpeggio (Italian for 'broken') is simply playing those notes one for one, instead of all together.\n\nWhat defines a song is mostly the chord progression. The composer picks a mode, picks a root note, and then chooses 8 (or more or less) chords from the key defined by that root note. There are some rules for what chords to pick of course, but it's still an art. In a real song, on this chord the rest is built, there can be all kinds of deviations from this structure of course, all sorts of ornamentations, but often you'll still be able to recognize the chords in that order.\n\nIf you want to hear a song you definitely ought to recognize, set the root note to D, the mode to Major, 4 arpeggio steps (3210), and the chord progression: I V vi iii IV I IV V \n\n", "id": "d53bf5s"}, {"comment": "Thank you so much for putting the time into writing this, I've learned a whole lot.", "id": "d53v7md"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d53m456"}, {"comment": "Modes (the vaguely Italian words) dictate which notes are allowed in the key, and the Roman numerals are the universal representations of the chords.

When you press down several piano keys (notes) at the same time, they make up something called a chord. Each combination of notes create a particular chord. By the same token, if you've ever seen a guitarist strum up and down instead of picking individual strings, he/she is playing a chord. Different chords have different qualities such as sounding happy (major chords) or sad (minor chords) or jazzy (7th chords).\n\nArpeggiating a chord is a process where, instead of playing all the notes that make up a particular chord at the same time, you play them all individually in a certain pattern and at a certain speed. For example you could play a C major chord from the lowest note to the highest (C, E, then G), vice versa (G, E, then C) or really any pattern you can think of.\n\n", "id": "d53a2v1"}, {"comment": "A chord is when you play a few notes together. Most pop songs have 3 or more chords changing between each other throughout, and they help create the mood of the song. Eg, major chords generally sound happier, and minor chords sounds more sad.

Then, right when they say \"friend\" it goes major. It continues in major until they say \"silence\". \n\nThere are many more types of chords than just major and minor, but those are the ones you will recognize most easily. The chord type is determined by how the notes are spread out from a given \"base\" or \"key\". Eg, you can have a major chord based on any key on a piano. It will evoke the same \"feeling\" but in a higher or lower pitch. \n\nAn arpeggio is when you play the notes of a chord separately, in sequence.  This is often used in the study of music, whether to understand the chords, or to improve dexterity in different keys. Arpeggios can also be heard in music pieces.\n\nThis app plays arpeggios for chords based on any key you choose. The numbers in the \"chord progression\" area tell the program which note of the given scale/key (think do re mi fa so..) to start the apreggio on.  \n\nIt's not really useful for making music.

If I'm in c major (the white keys on the piano, from the note c to the next c above it), my \"home base\" chord is C Major. This is known as the \"tonic\". Most songs you hear will start and end on the tonic chord, else the tune feels unresolved (which is sometimes desirable).\n\nThe notes in a c major triad (don't worry about that term- just think \"chord\") are C, E, and G. Just skip every other note from C and ta-da! You have some form of a C major chord. \n\nAn *arpeggio* is the playing of the notes in a chord separately. So instead of hitting C, E and G at the same time (which can sound clunky or boxy), each note is played separately. You are still playing the same notes, but now you are playing them one at a time. It might help to think of it as the difference between hitting all of the strings on a guitar at the same time (strumming) and picking only one string at a time. \n\nI wouldn't be too concerned with the direction of the arpeggio. That isn't really how we think about it, but I really like the way he did it for this app. Think of it this way- you can start on the C and go up to G (in any order), or you can start on the G and go down to C. Those are the two most basic arpeggiated movements, but you have probably already figured out that you can do many more than these two combos.\n\nCool app. I'd suggest trying I V vi IV, though. There are a billion songs based on some variation of that progression. Don't ask me why, because that's a much, much longer explanation :)\n\nSource: Summa Cum Laude, Berklee College of Music\n\nEdit: Bonus fun fact.

Each mode has a specific pattern of different chord qualities (e.g. ionian is I=major, ii=minor, iii= minor etc.).  Now, modal mixture is when you mix the patterns of each mode together.. In other words, you could have I-ii from ionian, iv from aeolian, bii from phrygian, V from ionian.. etc.  This is where you end up with really interesting sounding chord progressions.  Plus, due to the fact that all of the modes are the same, just starting on different notes (calling a different note I, in the same collection of notes), there's almost no point in having a modes option.  They will all tend to sound like they are ionian.  For instance, make a chord progression in the \"lydian\" mode, and tell me it doesn't sound like the V chord is the I (in other words, the \"main\" chord... should sound like home).\n\nCool app, But a few tweaks would be nice.  Also, I would like it if the capitalization of the roman numerals corresponded correctly to the chord quality (I admit that is music theory nazi-ish, but this will drive anyone well versed in music insane.)\n\nEDIT: corrected some careless mistakes.  derp.", "id": "d53dd42"}, {"comment": "ha! dont feel bad. that was incredibly valid and valuable feedback.\n\ni will say that your definition of an \"interesting progression\" is undoubtedly more sophisticated than my own, but is equally as subjective.

You can write in other modes, but it needs a melody to lead it (and I could see someone playing a melody over this app to do exactly that).\n\nAlso, in Lydian, it should be V that sounds like the tonic to you. iv is a diminished triad. It's Mixolydian where IV will sound like a tonic.", "id": "d53hs85"}, {"comment": "> As someone well-versed in theory, it doesn't drive me insane, and I think your post is needlessly pedantic for an app like this.\n\nI was thinking the same thing and wondering what motivated the kind of comment he posted.

We take this for granted on a day to day basis, but it's something you have to think about when you want to display virtual environments that don't actually exist. \n\nMore or less, there's a lot of linear algebra and geometry. Without going into too much detail, there are mathematical tools to transform coordinates in 3d space to coordinates in 2d space based on what perspective you want. You can think of the choosing the perspective like choosing a camera lens. Different lenses will bend light differently, so it follows choosing different lenses will change how things look in 2d. In summary, if you've got a bunch of 3d coordinates, the position of your camera, and a lens, you can do the math to transform that all into a 2d picture. You can take my word for it that this part of the process is pretty standard and not too difficult.\n\nBack to the topic at hand.. \n\nWhat they've done is come up with a method to guess the position of the camera and kind of lens (\"full perspective camera\") and the 3d coordinates of the head (\"3d head model\") from a 2d picture.

Anyway, the end goal is to modify the 2d picture so that it  *looks* like a change happened in the 3d environment. How do they do that?\n\nWell, it's pretty easy now that they've guessed the position of the camera, the lens, and the 3d head model from the original 2d photo. All they have to do is transform head and the camera position in the 3d environment and then use the aforementioned standard techniques to turn it back into a 2d image.

Instead, he suggested it was an oblate spheroid\u2014a sphere that is squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator.

He postulated that the earth was slightly bulged at the equator (which is actually different than the shape of a lemon, if we are being nitpicky). Then the earth was later found to have an average difference of about 13 miles in radius, when you compare a point at a pole to a point at the equator.\n\nThe radius of the earth is about 3950 miles.  So that 13 mile discrepancy amounts to a 0.3% deviation from being a perfect sphere.  This would barely be noticeable if you had a model of the earth shrunk down to something that could fit in your hand.  It is so close to a sphere that you might not know the difference.  You definitely would not look at it and say, \"wow the earth is shaped like a lemon\". \n\nWhy the hell are we still talking about this?  Everyone knows the earth is not perfectly spherical.

Because the new things are shrinking fast enough, the sum of an infinite number of things is still a finite number. \n\nA lot of people find this unintuitive, but I think zeno's paradox is a perfect example, since we all know perfectly well that you can, in fact, reach a destination.\n\nFor another example, any repeating decimal, like 1/3=0.333... could be thought of as a convergent sequence, with each of the infinite digits being another little thing we're adding (this time one little piece is ten times smaller than the previous).", "id": "dag49zn"}, {"comment": "Because he got it backwards.

Some theories do have space be fundamentally discrete. No, I wouldn't really say that's what the Planck length is about.\n\nIf the world is continuous, then Zeno's paradox is actually worth talking about. My best explanation is, you take take an infinite number of steps, but you don't have to travel an infinite distance to do so. Similarly, you don't have to take an infinite time to do so. So Zeno's paradox doesn't show that they'd never get there (take forever), it shows only that you can go back and point to an infinite number of events happening in the process, if you like.\n\nThe math that describes this stuff is calculus.

Are they colony/colonizer? At war? Trade partners? Ethnic groups within a nation? Different socioeconomic classes? How common is bilingualism? \n* Whose variety is most prestigious?

And whether or not you pick up any words from them is not based on chance. It depends on whether you find that word useful or not (do I already have a word for it? do I associate the word with high status or a particular group I want to be part of? are any teachers telling me that this new word is from the devil? etc). \n\nAnd the way in which you change the sound of the word or not to suite your own purposes is also not random.

This doesn't even get close enough to accuracy to even be called a simulation.\n\nIf you think that the phonological changes languages experience during language contact consist of \"change a vowel,\" \"change a consonant,\" and \"combine words,\" then you really need to take courses on phonetics, phonology, morphophonology, and historical linguistics. This just covering the *sounds* of language change, but you'll get a small taste of the kinds of grammatical changes and loaning that can occur in the historical linguistics course.\n\nJust off the top of my head as a phonetician, phonetically this \"simulation\" has a couple of very clear problems- first, the vowel and consonant changes are random. In real life, what change would occur during a vowel or consonant shift is based on the surrounding phonological environment. For example, let's say we have a hypothetical word [sifra]. If you told anyone with a linguistics background to make their best guess on an obvious sound change that might happen, they would tell you that the [s] will likely become [\u0283], the English <sh> sound. This is because it is followed by a high front vowel [i] which often leads to palatalization of the preceding consonant.\n\nOther sound changes that this \"simulation\" doesn't account for: metathesis (jokingly referred to as methatesis in linguistics circles), the many kinds of assimilation including but not limited to palatalization and velarization, lenition, fortition, elision, epenthesis, gemination, and rhotacism. Plus a ton of other phonetic things we don't have time to talk about, like vowel harmony.\n\nThat's just on the phonetics side.

Britain was an island that was incredibly prone to being attacked by other forces during most of its history, and this is a huge factor in how it is spoken today. Take the Norman invasion of England, for example. The Normans spoke what was an archaic version of modern day French, and the English at the time would be more accurately referred to as being Anglo-Saxon. When the Normans invaded, they brought their language with them. This caused a sort of odd blending of the languages, into the aptly named Anglo-Norman (which is a lot closer to what we speak today than French or Anglo-Saxon are). Part of this is because the proletariat did not pick up on the whole business of speaking French- if you weren't in contact with the Normans, why would you need to? The ones who were- the gentry and nobles in the land. They, in contrast, often used Norman words to describe things, and this is seen most prominently in English in how we refer to meat. The people who were eating it, and having it prepared, used the Norman term- boef- to refer to what is now known as beef. Those who were farming the animal, however, used the Anglo-Saxon term- cu- or, more accurately nowadays, cow. This is why you get a disparity between what you call an animal and what you call the meat it produces in very few languages, but it's prominent in English. This is also why certain things, like turkey, native to North America and discovered far after the British had established themselves as a power that did not quite enjoy the whole being invaded thing, use the same name for the animal and the meat. \n\nUnless the simulation had the capacity to account for incredibly minute variables like that, and had some way to account for the fact that this blending of languages doesn't always happen (and linguists don't have a clear answer of why it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't), it'd be hard to make a truly accurate language evolution simulator.

For example, syllables ending in a fricative like -s or -h often have a falling tone, while syllables that end in a glottal stop may get a rising tone.  This can even happen in nontonal languages like English.  If the -h, -s, or glottal stop then disappear, the tone change can still be present.  This is what happened in Chinese, plus syllables that ended with neither took a middle tone (and syllables that ended in -p -t -k did other things).  While English has a two-way contrast between p/b, t/d, and k/g (each is pronounced at the same place in the mouth; while details are extremely complicated, roughly the first of each pair is aspirated and the second is voiced), Middle Chinese had a three-way contrast, with a plain set as well that was neither voiced or aspirated.  Voiced sounds naturally tend to lower tone in following vowels, and so when Middle Chinese voiced sounds merged into the other two series, syllables that once had a voiced consonant still kept their lower tone, doubling the three tones to six.

I see this shape kinda looks like this other shape I saw earlier, and this one too has a line on the right, and this one has a line on the right too. It seems that everytime I see a line on the right I also see a line on the left. The lines are kinda jaggedy here but they're similar to that last picture I saw.\"\n\nThey start to spot patterns (see a similar shape many times), like us. In this case, the network is guessing what number you wrote in the black box on the top left after 'learning'/'training' (seeing 1, 2, 3, 4... in many different variations - like different handwriting). \n\nWhen you write \"4\" the network guesses \"I'm pretty (97%) sure dis is a four so I will put the 4 light on, but I'm 3% sure it's a 2 so I'll put that on a little bit too.\"", "id": "d77u6wg"}, {"comment": "Hmm, ok.

", "id": "d77yiqt"}, {"comment": "The neurons in an artificial neural network are analogous to the idea of neurons in a brain in that they take in an input, perform some operation on it and use that operation to decide what the output should be.  \n\nTake the example of the numbers in the OP's link which are stored as an image, the input might be some number that decribes the colour of each pixel and where it is in the image. These numbers are combined in a *weighted sum*, that is they are multiplied by some number, called a *weight*, to make them bigger or smaller depending on how important each type of input is and are then added together. The output from the neuron is then produced based on some *activation function* which is just a fancy term for an object that decides what to do with the input.  \nA neural network will learn by taking an input and trying to figure out what the input is. It is then told what the right answer is and strengthens the weights that would make it get the correct answer in that situation and weaken the weights which gave it the wrong answer.\n\nDepending on the network, the neurons can be connected in different ways. My knowledge of this has been self-taught so the type I'm most familiar with is the [multilayer backpropagation model](http://cse22-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/exp4/images/structure.png) which has a series of neurons in layers. Each neuron in each layer is attached to all of the neurons in the layers either side of it.\nOther types of network exists, such as the [Hopfield model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network) or the [Boltzmann Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_machine).", "id": "d783u41"}, {"comment": "OK, your second paragraph there, I think, is vaguely what I was imagining regarding an algorithm that updates itself. So one individual neuron can be fed an image (or whatever) and return some conclusion about it.

This probably isn't exactly correct, but this example is good enough to get the point across:\nImagine that we're training a network to decide whether or not a number is a seven or not. Well if we had a single neuron we might find that it looks to see if that number has a straight line in it. Great! The numbers 0,2,3,5,6,8 and 9 all have curved lines! But we forget that the number 1 also has only straight lines. So while we've reduced the set of possible numbers that our number could be, we haven't enabled our network to figure out whether a number with only straight lines is a 1 or a 7. We add more neurons to figure out the subtle differences that separate the numbers 1 and 7 and other numbers. Most of the time we don't actually know how these neurons identify numbers but this is an idea of how one network might work.\n\nAll of the neurons in the entire network will make decisions based on the outputs of the neurons in the layer previous. At the very end the layers update their weights going *backwards* one at a time, each layer's update contributing to the next layer's update.  The last layer will update it's weights first, then the second last layer and so on.

It got every single digit I tried as the first guess on my first try. It very clearly works, and likely people finding \"mistakes\" probably don't know how Neural Networks are constructed or how they work.\n\nThings to watch out for: It seems pretty clear this was trained on centered images. I suspect it actually may have been trained on text-to-image output of typed text for each number, rather than human drawn numbers with a key (which is how it should be trained train to recognize hand-drawn numbers). In addition it only has two layers, so small deviations away from what the training set looks like will cause it to be wildly wrong. \n\nThis doesn't mean the Neural Network is broken, wrong, or shitty. It means one of two things*:\n\n * Either the creator trained it with the wrong data set for what it was to be used for, meaning using it for handwriting recognition is using the wrong tool for the job, like using hammer to fasten a screw;\n\n * Or people are using it wrong, as it was never meant (trained for) handwriting recognition anyway, like asking why your car can't fly.\n\nIn any case, the end result is that inputting a number too far to any side will cause it to fail spectacularly. In particular, putting a 0 too high/low seems to make it recognize that as one of the two loops in 8 and output an 8. In addition, it seems to be trying to recognize the digital version of 4, with the triangle at top. In putting the 4 with two prongs at the top seems to cause lots of misreads.\n\nAvoid those pitfalls and you'll see it works almost all the time.\n\n*It could also mean a third thing, that the phenomena trying to be modeled is too complex to be captured by just two layers, but I don't think that is case here.", "id": "d77yupv"}], [{"comment": "My CPU is a neural net processor; a learning computer.", "id": "d77yvsf"}], [{"comment": "I drew a dick 8/10 would draw again", "id": "d781hfm"}], [{"comment": "I read every comment on this thread and I still don't know what this does or what I'm supposed to do", "id": "d78c4cx"}], [{"comment": "It is super slow on my phone.

For ubiquity, standard and\nreadily accessible technologies are used to implement the service\nand to enable communication over diverse networks. Based on\nquantitative evaluation, the service has been found to meet its\nperformance requirements. For small groups of co-located\nlisteners, latency between the broadcaster and listeners falls under\nthe threshold that can be perceived by humans, and playback\nappears synchronised. For groups of remote listeners, the\narchitecture introduces little latency, but individual groups\ncontinue to enjoy synchronised playback. The service maintains\nsufficiently high quality audio in all cases, as dictated by its\noperating context.", "id": "d7q811a"}, {"comment": "> the need to scale to accommodate increasing numbers of users\n\nThis is when I realised how this would help at parties.\n\n", "id": "d7qbx6o"}, {"comment": "Exactly :) We found that audio quality deteriorates above around 10 connections for performance mode, but in scalability mode, the audio quality is maintained for up to 100 connections (probably more but that was the limit of our evaluation).", "id": "d7qc4bs"}, {"comment": "Great to know and thanks again!", "id": "d7qccqz"}, {"comment": "I seem to understand that point of the audio stream is one-> many with low latency.\n\nDo you share wifi slots or did you keep the point to point standard protocol?\n\nWhat are advantages and disadvantages of this system respective to DAB+?\n\nHow do you \"keep it on the clock?\" \n\nThank you", "id": "d7qez0a"}, {"comment": "What do you mean by \"with no hardware requirements\"?", "id": "d7qebjo"}, {"comment": "We simply mean no specialised hardware like speakers, amplifiers, microphones, power supplies etc. used in traditional public address systems/home theatre systems/lecturing systems.

A couple points of constructive criticism though:\n\n1) Your graph is unweighted, so Dijkstra's is really just a BFS and could be omitted. I'm not sure what the \"weight\" option in your config does, but if it applies weight to all edges, then it's still unweighted. If you want to add the concept of weight, you'd have to allow the user to draw some sort of feature that slows you down, but doesn't block you (like a wall).

This is much better than the other post today that failed to illustrate at all what A* actually does, and also used it on a maze which doesn't make much sense (something a newbie can visually verify for themselves with your page, by watching A* perform worse than BFS in a maze). A couple points of constructive criticism though:\n\n1) Your graph is unweighted, so Dijkstra's is really just a BFS and could be omitted. I'm not sure what the \"weight\" option in your config does, but if it applies weight to all edges, then it's still unweighted. If you want to add the concept of weight, you'd have to allow the user to draw some sort of feature that slows you down, but doesn't block you (like a wall). Call it a tar pit. :-) Having this actually be weighted would also do a much better job illustrating the strengths of the other A* variants.\n\n2) Your IDA* implementation crashes my browser immediately for something as simple as a vertical line drawn between the points (Chrome skyrockets to 2GB+ memory usage). IDA* has a better worst-case space complexity than A*, and the same worst-case time complexity. Which means (since your A* implementation does not crash for similar inputs) that something is wrong with your IDA* code.

This very early image recorded on 3 March 2016, takes us over the River Nile and Delta and the surrounding desert areas of northeast Africa and parts of the Middle East.\n\n>Very distinct is Egypt, a country connecting northeast Africa with the Middle East, home to millennia-old monuments still sitting along the lush Nile valley.\n\n>In the centre of the image, capital city Cairo with the Nile snaking northwards is clearly visible, along with the Red Sea just further east. Also evident are the islands of Cyprus further north in the Mediterranean Sea and parts of Crete on the very left.\n\n>One of the suite of sophisticated instruments that will measure Earth\u2019s oceans, land, ice and atmosphere, Sentinel-3\u2019s Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer \\(SLSTR\\) measures the energy radiating from Earth\u2019s surface in nine spectral bands, including visible and infrared.\n\n>The instrument improves on the capabilities of the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer carried by the Envisat satellite of 2002\u201312, including a wider swath of 1400 km, new channels and a partly higher spatial resolution.\n\n>Combining radiometer and colour data helps us to understand the state of vegetation better.\n\n>Launched last 16 February, Sentinel-3 will systematically measure Earth\u2019s oceans, land, ice and atmosphere to monitor and understand large-scale global dynamics. It will provide essential information in near-real time for ocean and weather forecasting, among other major applications.\n\n>Over land, this innovative mission will provide a bigger picture by monitoring wildfires, mapping the way land is used, providing indices of vegetation state and measuring the height of rivers and lakes, complementing the high-resolution measurements of its sister mission, Sentinel-2.", "id": "d2kpkun"}, {"comment": "Ye quicke browned foxe jumpes over ye lazy hound", "id": "d2kn5pp"}, {"comment": "*Ye olde", "id": "d2l2yps"}, {"comment": "*\u00dee olde", "id": "d2l96nn"}, {"comment": "THe Q\u00fcICK BRowN F0X JUMPeS oVER THe LAzy DoG .", "id": "d2kszsv"}, {"comment": ">More Y's", "id": "d2koj81"}, {"comment": "\"... lazy fox\"*", "id": "d2kkft7"}, {"comment": "quick river?", "id": "d2rkqd9"}], [{"comment": "Doesn't work on android :/", "id": "d2khwck"}, {"comment": "didnt work on my pc either. i had to load the site again for it to start, and even then it skipped the first few letters. \n", "id": "d2kumqe"}, {"comment": "Yep, not working on FF on Win10 for me.", "id": "d2l3dev"}, {"comment": "I use RiF and it works for me.", "id": "d2kkbrg"}, {"comment": "Neither Android 6.0's Chrome, Firefox or RIF embedded browser worked for me.", "id": "d2kla2u"}, {"comment": "It works for me on Rif android 6.0", "id": "d2kmf1v"}, {"comment": "6.0 RiF, not working.

I have been meditating on my emotions and I realized that I feel angry and fearful a lot of the time even when I am hardly aware of it, the way I react is from the family of anger and fear.

Just high enough where I can pass as neurotypical most of the time. The English language alone can be convoluted; many words having multiple meanings when used in conjunction with other words.\n\nWhat doesn't translate is my inability to read physical cues such as discomfort or agitation. Words only mean so much when you can't pick up the underlying \"feel\" of the person saying them. For example, \"That's nice\" can be used as a phrase for trying to end a conversation or encouraging the conversation to continue.\n\nA book I'd recommend, if you get the chance, is [The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome by Tony Attwood](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Aspergers-Syndrome/dp/1843106698). It's helped me to cultivate a deeper understanding of how I work along with finally giving me a bit of closure as to why I process things the way I do.\n\nThe best analogy I can come up with, at the moment, is handing someone a hammer and telling them to \"go hammer\".

I have a really hard time recovering from a social faux pas correctly, and usually just end up making the situation worse. I end up being really careful and conservative in conversations now just to avoid it.

Everything else we feel is based on those 4 human emotions. If you feel argumentative you are angry even if it's only a tiny tiny bit. That is why they are BASIC. I have been meditating on my emotions and I realized that I feel angry and fearful a lot of the time even when I am hardly aware of it, the way I react is from the family of anger and fear. But remember, this Tone analyzer can not analyze YOUR emotions, it can only analyze from a certain perspective what others might typically respond to what you say (they might not even realize their response it might be a tiny tiny tiny amount.)

So if you forget one rule, or if the circumstances slightly change, you won't know what to do. \n\nOf course it doesn't really matter that much if you won't use math in your job or college, but it would still make things simpler if you understood it at a deeper level.\n\nI'll go through a few of the rules and explain the underlying reasons just to explain \"what is even meant by that\"\n\n\n1. distributivity. Nothing to say here as far as I know. You can prove it if you like, but there really isn't a deeper level to it.\n\n2. When you multiply two fractions, the denominators multiply with each other and the numerators multiply with each other, separately. Since a is just a/1, you multiply the top part by a and the bottom by 1. Going deeper, this stems from the elementary property of **associativity** (of multiplication). Written differently, a\\*(b/c) = (a\\*b)/c. When you think about it, if you reduce the size of something then increase it, it's the same as if you first increase it and then reduce it. The *net change* is the same.\n\n3. For the same reasons, (a/b)/c = (a/c)/b. What you're actually doing is dividing a by both b and c, so you have a/b AND a/c. You can write this as a/b \\* 1/c. Once again you multiply the tops with the tops and bottoms with bottoms, you get (a\\*1)/(b\\*c) = a/(bc). In other words, *one fourth of one half is one eighth.* \n\n4. Same situation, but now you can extrapolate a more general rule from these 2. Whatever the numerator is divided by, the denominator can be multiplied by and vice versa. This is simply because fractions are just division, and division is the opposite of multiplication. So **whenever you divide something you are *dividing by*, you're essentially multiplying your original thing!**.\n\n5. How many eighths do you have in one whole? Eight eighths, and you can group those eighths however you like. So one whole can be 2/8 + 5/8 + 1/8 or if you prefer (1+2+5)/8. In other words 5/8 is the same as two eighths and three eighths. (2+3)/8 = 2/8 + 3/8 = 5/8. As long as fractions have the same denominators (*they are divided/divisible by the same number*), you can combine or separate their numerators.\n\n6. Since **subtraction is just addition** with negative numbers, the exact same rule must apply.\n\n7. Clearly, the negative of (a - b) = -1\\*(a - b) = [-a -(-b)]. Since the negative of a negative is positive, it's (-a+b) or (b-a). So, to summarize -(a-b) = (b-a). Simple. If you make the top (or just one) part of a fraction negative, the whole fraction turns negative. If you however make the bottom part negative too, you once again turned the whole thing positive (2 negatives make a positive). So, take (a-b)/(c-d), make both of them negative -(a-b)/[-(c-d), clearly you still have the same fraction. Write it differently: (b-a)/(d-c) and you get this \"rule\". As you can see it's no rule at all, it's literally just a specific case of the fact that **two negatives make a positive**.\n\n8. How does this differ from rule 6?

The problem is that for real numbers, it is easy to make the convention that the sqrt function represent the positive root. However, any nonzero complex number has two square roots, and we cannot assign \"positiveness\" or \"negativeness\" to all the complex numbers. For instance, both 3-i and -3+i are square roots of 8-6i. Which one should be chosen as the \"correct\" output of the square root function on complex numbers?

If we consider the complex numbers as points on a plane this restriction means all the numbers we are considering are on the unit circle. We can assign each of these points a unique angle 0<=theta<2Pi in radians by considering the point in polar coordinates.\n\nNow this means x = cos(theta) and y = sin(theta). Here is where the usefulness of the complex numbers comes in. It turns out that because of [Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_identity) that if we have complex numbers z_1 and z_2 with angles theta_1 and theta_2 that the angle of z_1 * z_2 is theta_1 + theta_2.\n\nNow say I have two fixed complex numbers a+bi and c+di with angles theta and phi respectively. Then (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (ad+bc)i. Now since the real and imaginary components of the complex numbers a,b,c, and d can be expressed as cos and sin of theta and phi. We also know that the product adds the angles so this means that cos(theta + phi) = ac-bd and sin(theta + phi) = ad+bc. \n\nMaking the appropriate substitutions for a,b,c, and d in their trig forms and you've recovered the addition identities. Substitute -1(c+di) for c+di to get the difference identities. Set theta = phi to get the double angle identities.

You can also get fairly close with the satellite hybrid, showing major roads and a bit of fuzzy detail of structures below, but you can make out groups of homes, major stores, factories, and the like. If you want to, you can even approximate how far away a strike is by timing the difference between flash and thunder, while taking into account your current location in relation to the strike on the map. If you time enough of them, you can get a fairly good approximation of how big the storm is, where its core is.\n\nI definitely have a much better appreciation and understanding of weather, and it really gives a sense of how intense the storms are. You should have seen the map light up when Texas got its record rainfall and severe flooding, there were regions entirely covered with strikes, represented by bolt icons.
