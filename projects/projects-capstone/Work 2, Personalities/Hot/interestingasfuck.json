Nothing like having a sharp knife when you're preparing food...", "id": "dao8wri"}, {"comment": "Here, I've kept this piece of advice from a Reddit post in 2011 (this isn't from me):\n\n\n\"Never, ever use those sharpeners you run the knife blade through. I have worked in too many restaurants that use those in the kitchen and their chef's knives are fucking concave and unable to properly chop. Those sharpeners ruin knives.\n\nEnd of rant.\n\nBasics\n\nSo here's the story on sharpening. Like any art form, there are a number of perfectly acceptable ways to arrive at pretty much the same end result: a sharp(er) edged piece of metal.\n\nYou could get really, really technical and buy a knife sharpening jig so you end up with the exact right edge angle every time, or you could throw all that out the window and adjust the angle at which you grind base upon nothing but the sound of the edge sliding across your stone.\n\nWhile I'm sure spending a shit ton of money on a fancy stone and a collection of gadgets will provide you with a sharp knife, I approached knife sharpening with two tools. A synthetic sharpening stone with a coarse side and a fine side, and a dull,but high quality hatchet I got for x-mas two years ago.\n\nBlade Angle\n\nI read a short online about how different blade angles were useful for different things. My understanding is that obtuse angled blade aren't as useful for slicing things because they're thicker, but their great for blunt force splitting on mauls, because they exert lateral force as well as cutting force to help split through wood or bone. Plus they're more durable because the supporting metal is thicker closer to the edge than on a blade with an acute edge angle.\n\nA blade with an acute edge angle can be made sharper as far as I understand, and sharper blades are good for slicing, naturally. However, since at the absolute edge of that blade, the metal is microns thick, and as such is very delicate and will dull quickly because of use as well as oxidation.\n\nSo, bearing this in mind I decided to eyeball a 45 degree edge angle, knowing full well that if I didn't end up grinding it at 45 degrees exactly, I would still have a sharp blade and it would still work. You should bear this in mind too.\n\nSharpening Style\n\nSome people like to scrape the entire length of the blade across the stone in one motion, some people like to sharpen one part of the blade at a time, some people like to use small circles, and some people like to tapdance. I recommend using all of these methods, but only when appropriate (and never combine sharpening knives with tapdancing.)\n\nDifferent knives need different kinds of sharpening. I could try to dictate every thought I have about a knife as I'm sharpening it here, but I think it would be best to give you a small idea and let you develop your own methods that work for you.\n\nI size up a blade and try to see how much work I'm going to need to do. Does it have big nicks in it? If I want to get them out I'm pretty much going to have to put a brand new edge on the blade rather than sharpening the one that exists.\n\nDoes the edge have any flattened spots? Hold the (clean/dry) knife with the edge facing up in a well lit room or under a light. Does the edge of the knife reflect any light? A properly sharpened knife reflects no light (as does a properly sharpened assassin,) but nicks and flat spots will glint in the light as you shift the blade under the light. These are the spots you'll be watching for signs of improvement as you sharpen.\n\nChoose your angle and grinding style and start working the blade across the stone. Remember, this is steel we're talking about and you can apply a good amount of force to make sure you feel grinding happening. *Also a note to remember, the combination of dull knives and excessive force is bad for your health, as documented across many publications. Be careful. *\n\nRandom Yet Useful Notes\n\nI also recommend practicing by sharpening a shitty knife (or someone elses nice knife) before you sharpen your own.\n\nAs you get more familiar with how sharpening a knife feels, you'll feel a difference in how the grinding feels as you get closer to sharp.\n\nIf you're simply sharpening a knife with a decent edge already, it's probably best just to try to match the edge that already exists. If you slowly change your grinding angle from shallow to steep, you should be able to feel the transition from when your grinding on the shoulder of the edge to where you're actually grinding the razor edge itself. Ride this line.\n\nStart with the coarsest stone you think you need and gradually work your way up to a finer stone (otherwise just use whatever stone you've got, it'll still get plenty sharp.)\n\nRemember to switch back and forth and sharpen both sides of the blade. Every time you sharpen one side of the blade, you create little ribbons of metal still attached to the razor edge that fold over to the other side, switching back and forth helps to cut this stuff off, so does using a strop when your done. Wiki it. I like to do something like this: 5 strokes on side A, 5 on side B, 3 on side A, 3 on side B, 1 on A, 1 on B, 1 on A, 1 on B. Until I feel done.\n\nI test my knives by scratching my thumb pad across the grain of the blade (not along it!) It feels really scratchy when it's razor sharp and not as scratchy when it still needs work.\n\nConclusion\n\nJust start doing it, you'll be good at it in no time. Most of these skills can be extrapolated to work for other tools like carving tools and shovel edges.\n\nA note about tool storage and blade care. As I said before, a sharp knife is incredibly thin on the edge and is susceptible to damage if used for anything but cutting properly. Don't run your knives through the dishwasher, don't throw them in the sink with the other dishes, and don't put them on the metal dish rack. Don't keep them in a drawer all together to bang against each other and get dull. Think about everything that blade touches and how that affects the edge. Don't store your shovels with the tip down (or on concrete! Heavens!) Take care of your blade and it will stay sharp for a long time.\n\nBonus tip for those of you who read this entire post: Examine the bottom of your ceramic coffee mug. Does it have a ring on the bottom of un-glazed ceramic? Does the texture of that ceramic remind you of how your sharpening stone feels? Bingo, if used properly, you can easily keep sharpen a knife in any kitchen that has coffee mugs in it. You're set for life.\n\nP.S.

You're required to drug test your horse and have it examined before each show, horse trailers and general horse transport is very expensive, and saddlery/tack is ever in need a of replacing preparing and upkeep. \n\nIn addition horses are pretty prone to injury, I've never heard of a riding horse that wasn't lame or in some way injured at some point and vets are extremely pricey and they know their generally wealthy clientele will pay handsomely for those services. Throw in the cost of Farrier visits, vaccines, coggins tests, blood line information/ancestry services,  Deworming, and you've racked up quite a bill that you'll have to pay regularly every couple months or years depending on how often you'll need them, Farriers and Deworming for instance are every two months.\n\nAlso, owning a field for them to graze in is not suitable for competition riding practice; an extremely level, well groomed, usually large arena is necessary to train in, fields have irregularities which can trip the horse and boom they're injured again. \n\nIn the winter you've got to use an indoor arena and you've definitely either got to pay for use of another riding barn's or build your own. I won't count rider injuries those aren't crazy common.\n\nThis does all depend on whether or not you ride English or Western and the quality of the horse demanded. I can grab a shit horse somewhere for next to nothing but I highly doubt it'll be a jumper, and it's probably barely trained in either style enough to compete.

First the TENS unit will randomly decide to malfunction. You got to troubleshoot the damn thing. \n\n2. Secondly, the sticky electrode pads are expensive and insurance regularly denies them. Of course the de-sticky themselves after two uses, so you got to make them work with drops of water or that alcohol hand sanitizer stuff placed on the sticky side (yes, the manufacturer allegedly recommends this!!) *then* tape the things in place and hope they work *and* don't come loose when the activated limb is moving. If it's the forearm, they will come loose. Be careful removing the old shitty tape, you can easily rip the electrode and then the client can't have TENS unit therapy because the insurance denied any new pads.\n\n3. Thirdly, the plug-in ends of the electrode pads will decide to stop working. So they'll be plugged in. There will be four. You have to figure out which one is not working and fix it somehow. Good luck. Generally your paralyzed patient can't help you here, their body sensation is jacked up.\n\n4. The strength settings of the TENS unit. How strong the shocks are to those taped-on non-sticky electrodes covered with alcohol sanitizer or water? The client will demand it be stronger or weaker current and change their mind every day. This makes sense given how non-sticky the shitty electrode pads are. Now the therapist/doctor will demand a *different* setting and some throw fits if client wants it different. Personally I go by what the client tells me, but not (much) over what the doc recommends, and put the dials back to prescribed charge when therapy is done.

Just going to use this number for reference. I'm just talking gamma radiation since its all that's really applicable here.\n\nSeems not bad, except if the radiation levels are high enough right now to fry circuits before even getting close, then the radiation levels would be extreme at close range.\n\nRadiation (gamma) follows the inverse square law in that, if you half the distance to a source, you quadruple the radiation dose rate. \n\nSo, if you're at the distance where you're in your maximum working fields for use of a camera, to half the distance to your source, you'd need to add about 0.6 inches of lead (two half value layers). And then another 0.6 inches to half that again. Etc. \n\nWith lead being so heavy, all this shielding significantly hinders your robot's ability to function. Also, any cracks or breaks in the shielding (think joints for moving parts) mean the full dose rate is hitting the exposed parts.\n\nNot saying there's not a potential solution with mirrors and telescopy or something and there are probably smart people working on something, but it's likely not a simple solution.

What you are actually seeing is the sonar relief of undersea mountains and valleys.  The MOR are zones of expansion and new tectonic plate creation.  These ridges are believed to overlay vast rising plumes of mantle moving in convective cells.  As you move away from the MOR, the plate gets colder, older and denser.  The plate contracts a bit and their is differential expansion pressure away from the MOR.  Parallel to the MOR are under sea uplift zones and mountain ranges, probably something like fold and thrust formations.  These are eroding features, while the smoother areas are slightly deeper and are able to function as depositional zones.  Cell theory is that there is a push and pull phenomenon.  Push from the cell pushing the central MOR up, dragging it along below, the plate sliding downhill towards its denser end, and finally being dragged under by the far portion being subducted back into the mantle where it comes up against another plate.\n\nOne thing you'll notice that is rather interesting is that western North America actually seems to have slid over the northern portion of the Pacific MOR.

Shirts underneath are put on, and every panel is raised, gets painted on, lowers, they all spin to the next location, raised, pained, and so on.

Shirts of whatever design was needed printed for hours at the rate of about one every second, while everyone kept an eye out for errors.\n\n It blows your mind when you see how fast people who work there can see the shirt, check it for quality (including a loose thread that got painted over), take it off, lay it flat on the oven, turn around, and keep up at a consistent pace.

Commercial manuals have 4-10+ pallets to load shirts and 4-12+ mounts for screens on independently spinning wheels. Meaning we print 4-12 shirts at a time and can mount up to 12 colors at once. On a manual the imprint process would look like the gif, with an operator pulling or pushing a squeegee. But he would spin the shirt under a dryer and print that same color on every shirt before moving to the next color. On our 6 Shirt press that would be 4 rotations for a total of 24 imprints on 6 shirts. We average a steady 7 seconds per imprint so around 2m50s per 6 shirts or 30 seconds a shirt. Assuming the stars align and we don't slow down, 120 shirts would take 1 hour (after setup). On our automatic, the loading and unloading falls on the operator, but the printing is done by the machine. All 4 colors print simultaneously, the limit being a flash dryer or the operators ability to load and unload. Typically we average 8-9 seconds per Shirt on our auto. This job with no slowdowns or re inking of the screens would take 16 minutes for 120 pieces on the auto.

Everything before and after is a set up to distract you from the fact that when the cut happens, he is the only person in the frame, and camera has been set on a tripod, there is some post-camera shake added to the frame to hide that. \n\nI guess I'm just tired of him not innovating. I see a video of his like this pop up every few months, hope to see something new, and by the end of the first viewing I know what he did, because he's done it in dozens of videos before.

Nowadays when we hone a knife on a sharpening steel, we are both aligning the edge and, when we use an abrasive (diamond/ceramic) steel, removing burrs from the edge. In short, while it's not technically incorrect to call it \"a hone\", it's weird. ", "id": "dams2mj"}, {"comment": "No, all knives use a very similar high carbon steel unless its surgical grade or a custom. The problem is that instead of being forged like a good w\u00fcsthof or shun set, they're stamped. While you are correct about them being softer it's not the material choice, it's the fabrication method. ", "id": "damhw4f"}, {"comment": "> all knives use a very similar high carbon steel unless its surgical grade or a custom.\n\nThis isn't true, or at least it's very misleading.  Pretty much all kitchen knives will use some variant of stainless steel (although some are still making carbon steel blades), but they vary considerably even when manufactured in a similar manner.\n\nW\u00fcsthof uses medium carbon stainless (~ 0.5% carbon), whereas Japanese makers tend to use higher carbon stainless, around 1%.  They also use steels with different additives.  \n\nCheap knives will probably be made  from 440 stainless, which is really high in Chrome and therefore very resistant to corrosion, with medium carbon so they are easy to sharpen, but with none of the fancy additives.  They will probably be heat treated to around 55-56 Rockwell.  They won't have either the toughness or hardness of the fancier steels, although 440C is still a pretty good steel.\n\nW\u00fcsthof uses X50CrMo14 which adds Manganese and Vanadium for hardness & wear resistance.  Still a medium carbon steel though, so you're still only hardening to around 56-57 Rockwell.  It will be a tougher knife than a 440 blade, but still easy to sharpen.  They'll never be quite as sharp as a Shun, but you can abuse them quite a bit and a bit of quick sharpening will have them right back in the game.\n\nShun uses a lot of VG10, which adds Cobalt and is also a much higher carbon steel at 1%.  This will heat-treat to 60-61 Rockwell, significantly harder than 440 or X50CrMo14.  The downside is that the edge can chip much more easily, rather than rolling as a 440 or X50CrMo14 blade would.  You can't give these blades much abuse at all, but they'll be very *very* sharp.", "id": "damnmga"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the correction, I was not aware of that.", "id": "damjdtn"}, {"comment": "And most chefs sharpen every day because of how much they actually use their knives during service, especially when they're given knives instead of expected to have their own set.
