But there are a few more stories from the same book. Here is my personal favorite:\n\n> An extreme example was found in a military project that involved not only programming but creation of a worldwide communication network. The programming project itself consisted of about 75 first-level people organized into twelve teams, with the twelve team leaders organized into three groups and the three group leaders reporting to one programming project manager. Within the company doing the programming, there were also projects to design and build the central computers and special hardware, so these three project managers were organized into a team under a single company project manager. The company project manager participated in a management team consisting of the project managers from the other companies and headed by an overall project manager.  \nEach month, by the requirements of the contract, a progress report had to be submitted to the government. Naturally, since this was an expensive project, the report had to be printed in an impressive full-color format. This meant that the final copy for the report had to be in the hands of the printer twelve days before the report deadline - the tenth of the month following the month of the report. Thus, for example, the September report had to be in the hands of the printer by September 28th - and possibly earlier if this fell on a weekend.  \nIn order for the overall project manager to have time to review and amend the report, he had to have each company report five working days before the printer's deadline. Allowing for mailing, this meant that the September company report would have to be finished by, say, the 20th. In this particular company, the company manager needed four working days for review of his three project managers' reports. Thus, the report of the programming project had to be in by about the 15th.  \nWorking backwards like this, we eventually reach the individual programming team, whose report had to be made about four days before the end of the month preceding the month of the report. Therefore, what the individual team was reporting was not progress for the month, but a prediction for the coming month. What came out the other end, however, was labeled as progress reporting, and nobody seemed to worry about the difference.  \nSo far, none of this is particularly psychological, except for two minor factors - the willingness of people to believe something that cannot possibly be what it pretends to be and the interesting relationship between the amount of time needed for reviewing reports, the level of the reviewer, and the amount of work actually contributed. The \"higher\" the reviewer, the longer he insisted he must have the reports and the less he actually did with them. Not that nothing was done - quite the contrary. At each stage of the consolidation, a certain smoothing-out was made, regardless of the content of the report.  \nThe reasoning at each stage went something like this. If a subgroup reported an abnormally high amount of progress, the reviewer would shave the amount a trifle under the assumption that it wouldn't hurt to hold a little in reserve in case their luck changed next month. If, on the other hand, little progress was reported, the reviewer would step it up by a point or two - not wanting to call attention to any weakness and resolving to look into the trouble if things persisted. Similarly, if the list of specific problems was too long, he shortened it a bit, leaving out the least important. If it was too short, he amplified some problem or other into two separate problems.  \nThe net result of six or seven stages of such filtering was a report that monthly presented a consistent forward progress, a few areas  slightly behind or slightly ahead, a few problems solved from last month, a few new problems, and a few problems still open. There was, in short, no measurable relationship between what had been reported at the bottom and what came out the top.  \nOf course, what went in the bottom was only a prediction of progress anyway, so perhaps it didn't matter what was done to it on the way up. In fact, when one of the team leaders in the programming project happened to get hold of a final report, he saw what had happened to his information and decided not to waste his time trying to be accurate. From that point on, instead of bothering his programmers with requests for progress predictions, he just made up a set of nice looking figures in five minutes and passed it on up the line. Within a few months, the same practice had spread to the other programming teams. And so, progress reporting went on with a minimum disturbance, or relation, to actual progress.", "id": "dap8mty"}, {"comment": "Just wow, now I want this book\nEdit: Gerald M.

After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself.\nBeing the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, \"Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?\"\nAnd keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel.\nSo I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, \"Uh... No thanks, I'm good.\"\n\"Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.\"\nSo a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, \"Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.\"\nSo I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, \"OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.\"\nSo I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.\nA couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, \"Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?\" Luckily, she says, \"Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't miss it.\"\nSo I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled \"Video Games.\" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, \"Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?\" and she responds with, \"No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it.\" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.\nSo I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.\nSo a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, \"Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me.\"\nI tell her, \"Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great.\" She says, \"Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow\nSo next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, \"Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again.\"\n\"Wait, what? Why not? What happened?\"\n\"Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.\"\n\"I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person\"\n\"She told me, and I quote, that she is going to fucking murder me.\"\n\"I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.\"\nI go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.\nSo day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.\nThen I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, \"She's dead, you're next.\" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.\nNow I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, \"She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next.\" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, \"She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next.\" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE.\nAnd it answers the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?"], [13, "7 8 9"], [5, "Because you touch yourself at night"], [5, "Or because Seven ate Nine :)"], [3, "Tim Cook's asshole just clenched."], [4, "It's okay OP, iPhone it in sometimes too..."], [3, "wat"], [3, "Because 7 beat Ohio State."], [2, "O damn"], [1, "How did 10 die?\nIt was in the middle of 9/11"], [1, "Because 7 is bigger, damnit!\n\n*10* is afraid of 7 because 7 8 9."], [1, "Six doesn't have room to spread rumors about seven like this, rumor has it 6 and 9 do pretty nasty stuff together"], [1, "6 always want to be with 9.

After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself.\nBeing the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, \"Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?\"\nAnd keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel.\nSo I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, \"Uh... No thanks, I'm good.\"\n\"Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.\"\nSo a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, \"Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.\"\nSo I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, \"OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.\"\nSo I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.\nA couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, \"Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?\" Luckily, she says, \"Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't miss it.\"\nSo I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled \"Video Games.\" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, \"Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?\" and she responds with, \"No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it.\" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.\nSo I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.\nSo a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, \"Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me.\"\nI tell her, \"Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great.\" She says, \"Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow\nSo next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, \"Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again.\"\n\"Wait, what? Why not? What happened?\"\n\"Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.\"\n\"I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person\"\n\"She told me, and I quote, that she is going to fucking murder me.\"\n\"I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.\"\nI go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.\nSo day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.\nThen I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, \"She's dead, you're next.\" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.\nNow I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, \"She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next.\" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, \"She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next.\" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE.\nAnd it answers the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?", "id": "darebm5"}, {"comment": "TAKE COVER!
