Yeah, the KKK exists, but that's not the main complaint of movements like BLM. They mainly oppose institutional racism that is deeply ingrained into the fabric of our society. The caricature of the left is arguably a better example of the subtle racism that \"alt-left\" movements are ostensibly targeting, and seem to be the main complaint from \"alt-right\" communities who complain about apologists and thought-police."], [2, "...that's not what racism means tho..."], [2, "This is simply not what people on the Left do. It's not a problem on the Left. Individuals may fail at Liberalism, may misunderstand it, or may be bigoted. But the very clearly-stated, obvious, and reasonable ideas behind the points in the comic (this is to say the ideas that provoke response by the artist) are just that. There is no equivalence between Right wing on these issues and Left. It's facile.\n\nSince I'm commenting, I might as well provide details. I'm happy to talk about these points. Maybe some of the information is helpful to people who have the mistaken idea that the points in the comic are accurate.\n\nIncidentally, if one has a grievance about an issue it's best if they bring it up with the person with whom they have the grievance. They must first find a person who has said something that aggrieves them, they must feel comfortable talking with that person, the other person must be able to talk about it, then there must be a thorough conversation. This is simply talking! If a black person says, \"White cops are racist,\" and it makes one think they are saying something inaccurate, talk to the person about it. \"Why do you say that? It sounds racist to me.\"\n\n...\n\nPanel 1. It's not racist to date someone of a particular ethnicity to show that one is liberal. It's posing. People may do this. Probably not many. \n\nPanel 2a. This is not what Affirmative Action is doing. Affirmative Action makes up for past racism by preferring an ethnicity that has been discriminated against over an equally-qualified, non-discriminated-against ethnicity. The idea is to get under-represented people into a position so that future hiring can be non-discriminatory, despite the possibility of preferring one's own ethnic group or culture.\n\nNumbers don't have to be perfect, but the idea is there. Some organizations may take this too far. It's not racism, it's a mistake.\n\nb. No one thinks these things: \n\n-- i. \"I must hire an exact ratio.\" (If this happens it's not racism, it's implementing a theory in practice.)\n   \n-- ii. \"A non-diverse group can't function.\" \n\nPanel 3a. No one thinks it's OK for Muslims to rape and murder.\n  \nb. No one thinks Muslims don't know any better (because they are inferior, ignorant, or any other reason).\n \nc. \"America made you do it\": Actions by America may cause people to dislike America and become violent against it. That is true. Many do not think that violence is justified by other negative action. The idea is to stop America from doing negative things. It's not to allow others to do negative things to America. Some people may think America's bad actions justify violence. However, this is not racism, this is a philosophical perspective.\n\nd. \"Your brown skin makes you peaceful and innocent\":\n    \n-- i. Thinking someone is better because of their ethnicity *is* racist. I'm sure some people think that. Probably not very many.\n    \n-- ii. Romanticizing ethnicities and cultures is not racist, it's romanticizing. It's an inaccurate view of something. It may ignore faults; it may idealize aspects; it may imagine aspects. This is not healthy. People do this.\n\nPanel 4. I don't know what the door is implying.\n\nPanel 5. \"You're fuckin' white!\": There are some people who are racist against whites. Nothing to do with \"Left Wing.\" There is a subtle caveat here with the fact of past racism. Is it racist to hate a racist? Yes. Hating whites for white racism is racism. But, having negative feelings towards racists is correct! At some point these negative feelings are not just negative feelings and are actually prejudice against a person for their ethnicity. Finding which it is is the goal here. \n\n...\n\nThere you go, my feedback. It is amazing how many ideas an artist can include in their art. But to resolve the issue one has to discuss the ideas.\n\nBy the way, the internet is not the place to learn this stuff. The place to learn this is school (for one). A teacher whom one knows and respects and who has made a name for themselves as competent, is someone whom one can trust far more easily than some stranger on the internet. Also, I'm no expert on this, so my understandings will not be perfect. Teachers *can* be experts on these topics. If you have a question, ask a teacher!\n\nA good teacher will accept even the most offensive-seeming question. For example: Are whites better than blacks in some areas? Only a bad teacher would consider an earnest question like that (and that is about as controversial as it gets) to be out of line. School is where we learn things. School is where ask these questions. Actual questions we have should be asked or else we secretly hold the questions. We may decide to answer them ourselves and may make mistakes."], [1, "Different people, different views. Let's take it as it is.

That may have been a deliberate confusion intended as part of the 'joke', but comes off as jarringly inconsistent, since the 'left' and 'right' labels, the respective exaggerated attitudes and conventionally associated colors are in the 'correct' place. Reversing the orientation on its own seems poorly done, and not entirely thought out (or worse accidental), muddying any desired effect.  It's reminiscent of [a recent post of an old horseshoe theory comic, maybe a similarly poor attempt at political satire](https://www.reddit.com/r/PropagandaPosters/comments/5dzlij/middle_of_the_road_church_of_the_subgenius_1983/), where the left and the right are also purported to 'meet'.  There it's in the degree of their fanaticism, while here it's in the similarity of their extremes.  It's rather telling that you can have *two* 'horseshoe' theory comics, going along entirely different axes with incompatible premises.  Which are we meant to believe? That they're similarly fanatical with diametrically opposed views, or with similar views but diametrically opposed fanaticism?  Do we selfishly just pick which ever is most conveniently in any given situation, luxuriating blissfully in ignorance of the inconsistency?  \n\nIn both, the right wing caricatures are almost not stereotypes, but uncomfortably close to nearly common and dangerously realistic, while the left wing caricatures are virtually all ludicrously unrealistic, maybe next to impossible to find, which suggests how far right the spectrum was or is being pushed.  Maybe one shouldn't underestimate left wing fools, but there just don't seem to be many and not like how this comic portrays them.  \n\nWho dates anyone because they want to appear 'progressive'?  Why would they care what anyone or society 'thinks'?  Who cares more about their publicly identifiable political affiliations when dating than their private sexual preferences, and what would you call that mental illness? Seriously, has any company manager *ever* spouted idiocy about 'reeses pieces' and 'muh racism' and argued that religiously, racially, ethnically or sexually homogeneous companies don't function? At the very least that's historically naive and would be some novel economic theory!  Who on the left condones murder and rape, infantilizes and conflates 'brown skin' with 'muslim'?  It's doubtful anyone on the left could even be offended by these, they so widely miss the target, even if you're somewhat sympathetic to the last two panels, and the notions that affirmative action is often just ill considered reactionary counter racism, and that obsession with racial purity and cultural dominance (e.g segretation and KKK) isn't categorically different from monomania over purported oppression of not being in the positions perceived as having the greatest privilege (e.g. safes spaces and BLM.  Just one interpretation of the last two panels).\n\n'Normal' the status quo is already incredibly systematically, institutionally, politically, socially and economically racist, while both comics only focus on individually ridiculous motives.  If this is meant to be satire too, it even utterly misses the mark even in that respect.  You can believe a guy would hate blacks if he keeps getting mugged by them, or a woman hating white men, if they keep getting promoted over her for example, but that's not so much funny 'ha-ha' as funny 'turn your stomach' feeling.  \n\n<added> Also all the 'lefties' have glasses and all the 'righties' don't.

So it goes in the left column because Westerners read left to right (and most of the world if I'm not mistaken). This then naturally leads the reader to assume the middle panel would be the \"neutral\" party in terms of how the message is being displayed. The right column or \"Last\" column is then naturally the \"punchline\", as it appears the artist wants us to see how the Horseshoe analogy fits in with the extremists on both sides of the fence.

Many of the institutions that we rely on like applying for loans, getting health insurance, going to school, seeking therapy and medicine, were all created with the white citizen in mind, even if they weren't trying to single out other races. Black people have a hard time getting loans not because bankers are overtly racist, they have a hard time because they have little collateral, and if they default, they are less likely than a white person to have a safety net like family members with jobs and money like white people do.

It's not a problem on the Left. Individuals may fail at Liberalism, may misunderstand it, or may be bigoted. But the very clearly-stated, obvious, and reasonable ideas behind the points in the comic (this is to say the ideas that provoke response by the artist) are just that. There is no equivalence between Right wing on these issues and Left. It's facile.\n\nSince I'm commenting, I might as well provide details. I'm happy to talk about these points. Maybe some of the information is helpful to people who have the mistaken idea that the points in the comic are accurate.\n\nIncidentally, if one has a grievance about an issue it's best if they bring it up with the person with whom they have the grievance. They must first find a person who has said something that aggrieves them, they must feel comfortable talking with that person, the other person must be able to talk about it, then there must be a thorough conversation. This is simply talking! If a black person says, \"White cops are racist,\" and it makes one think they are saying something inaccurate, talk to the person about it. \"Why do you say that? It sounds racist to me.\"\n\n...\n\nPanel 1. It's not racist to date someone of a particular ethnicity to show that one is liberal. It's posing. People may do this. Probably not many. \n\nPanel 2a. This is not what Affirmative Action is doing. Affirmative Action makes up for past racism by preferring an ethnicity that has been discriminated against over an equally-qualified, non-discriminated-against ethnicity. The idea is to get under-represented people into a position so that future hiring can be non-discriminatory, despite the possibility of preferring one's own ethnic group or culture.\n\nNumbers don't have to be perfect, but the idea is there. Some organizations may take this too far. It's not racism, it's a mistake.\n\nb. No one thinks these things: \n\n-- i. \"I must hire an exact ratio.\" (If this happens it's not racism, it's implementing a theory in practice.)\n   \n-- ii. \"A non-diverse group can't function.\" \n\nPanel 3a. No one thinks it's OK for Muslims to rape and murder.\n  \nb. No one thinks Muslims don't know any better (because they are inferior, ignorant, or any other reason).\n \nc. \"America made you do it\": Actions by America may cause people to dislike America and become violent against it. That is true. Many do not think that violence is justified by other negative action. The idea is to stop America from doing negative things. It's not to allow others to do negative things to America. Some people may think America's bad actions justify violence. However, this is not racism, this is a philosophical perspective.\n\nd. \"Your brown skin makes you peaceful and innocent\":\n    \n-- i. Thinking someone is better because of their ethnicity *is* racist. I'm sure some people think that. Probably not very many.\n    \n-- ii. Romanticizing ethnicities and cultures is not racist, it's romanticizing. It's an inaccurate view of something. It may ignore faults; it may idealize aspects; it may imagine aspects. This is not healthy. People do this.\n\nPanel 4. I don't know what the door is implying.\n\nPanel 5. \"You're fuckin' white!\": There are some people who are racist against whites. Nothing to do with \"Left Wing.\" There is a subtle caveat here with the fact of past racism. Is it racist to hate a racist? Yes. Hating whites for white racism is racism. But, having negative feelings towards racists is correct! At some point these negative feelings are not just negative feelings and are actually prejudice against a person for their ethnicity. Finding which it is is the goal here. \n\n...\n\nThere you go, my feedback. It is amazing how many ideas an artist can include in their art. But to resolve the issue one has to discuss the ideas.\n\nBy the way, the internet is not the place to learn this stuff. The place to learn this is school (for one). A teacher whom one knows and respects and who has made a name for themselves as competent, is someone whom one can trust far more easily than some stranger on the internet. Also, I'm no expert on this, so my understandings will not be perfect. Teachers *can* be experts on these topics. If you have a question, ask a teacher!\n\nA good teacher will accept even the most offensive-seeming question. For example: Are whites better than blacks in some areas? Only a bad teacher would consider an earnest question like that (and that is about as controversial as it gets) to be out of line. School is where we learn things. School is where ask these questions. Actual questions we have should be asked or else we secretly hold the questions.

I didn't even realize he was trying to block the text until I read the comments; I thought he was just mirroring his doppelganger because... reasons? \n\nAnd then there's the dead space around the last three panels. Like, the artist didn't want to give away the joke, but also didn't want to draw any extra. \n\nThe artwork itself is great, but all in all, not a good comic.

Basically that there are no \"rules\" to making art because there are no \"rules\" on how to feel about art. While from a universal perspective this is ultimately true, unfortunately those who tend to support this view are often simply uneducated about art and art-making. The best argument I've seen against this thinking is from the Introduction chapter of Story by Robert McKee:\n\n\"*Story is about principles, not rules. A rule says, \"You must do it this way.\" A principle says, \"This works... and has through all remembered time.\" The difference is crucial. Your work needn't be modeled after the \"well-made\" play; rather, it must be well made within the principles that shape our art. Anxious, inexperienced writers obey rules. Rebellious, unschooled writers break rules. Artists master the form.*\"\n\nUltimately art is all about communication, and communication requires a link between intent and understanding. Sure, everything is subjective, but inherently artistic intent limits the scope of that subjectivity. There are correct interpretations, and incorrect interpretations, with the exception of if the intent itself is to have the work open to interpretation. This work however, does not fall into that camp.\n\nIn the chapter he goes on to expand on the issue, each section headlined with the following:\n\n*-Story is about eternal, universal forms, not formulas.*\n\n-*Story is about archetypes, not stereotypes.*\n\n-*Story is about thoroughness, not shortcuts.*\n\n-*Story is about the realities, not the mysteries of writing.*\n\n-*Story is about mastering the art, not second-guessing the marketplace.*\n\n-*Story is about respect, not disdain, for the audience.*\n\n-*Story is about originality, not duplication.*\n\nWhile this book is a staple of education in screenwriting, these principles truly speak to art-making in general, and their understanding should be better disseminated among the general audience at large.\n\nFind the rest of the chapter [here](http://www.slideshare.net/Recursosparaquadrinistas/robert-mc-keestory)", "id": "damabtr"}, {"comment": "I, and obviously many other, understood the message of the comic perfectly.
