Your SO is their own person and they are working to develop their own wonderful human connections. I have been jealous many times before of my boyfriend's female friends, but I have found that interacting with them and getting to know them has helped ease some of my irrationality. My boyfriend is attractive, kind, and funny. I recognize these attractive qualities bring other attractive, kind, and funny people near him, male or female (hopefully myself included). \n\nI have shifted my perspective from feeling insecure and jealous watching him interact with his female friends to trusting him and working to develop my own positive human interactions. It feels much more healthy to recognize that each person in life is trying to live a happy, positive life. \n\nAlso, it's attractive to others (friends or SO's) when you're confident, positive, and one of the happiest in the room. Try to focus on your own human interactions and not worry so much about how your SO looks/reacts talking to someone else. You're robbing yourself of developing your own positive connection with someone else.

"], [15, "Whatever you do, ultimately you have to attack the problem at its source and not cover it up with band-aids.\n\nJealousy stems from both scarcity and insecurity.\n\nMost of the time I find jealousy comes from insecurity or not a sufficient level of self esteem. Everytime you aren't with your partner, those thoughts creep up because you don't feel valuable enoguh and may be worried she is 'looking for better'.  Compare that to a person who does know what he brings to the table and knows he is a great person. That aura exudes.

I am doing better now so I often buy things for free for my friends, take people to dinners, etc. Complete mindset change when you move away from scarcity.\n\nFor partners, it is a little different. Scarcity in 'relationships' is more just the idea of you dont feel like you can find another person 'like her' despite there being more than a billion options. When you stop talking to other people, when you don't really have a way to meet new people, you fall into scarcity.

But, what causes that insecurity can be any number of reasons, and how it impedes you can result in various circumstances.\n\nI have had that issue for a lot of my relationships. I had to see a therapist for years because I didn't want to feel as I had been. At its core, my jealousy was driven by an abusive past, which I never dealt with. How it manifested was terrible. Everyone was out to get me. I always put distance in my relationships so I would be indifferent rather than jealous - a poor strategy for happiness. And I ended up objectifying people, rather than seeing them for who they are and embracing, or rejecting, their character. Mostly with women in romantic relationships. \n\n I've gotten to a place where I can see someone for who they are and love them or not love them for it. The result is no jealousy, and feeling secure enough that if a girl cheats on me, fuck it. Just another opportunity for me to find a better one, or the right one, for me. Because really, anything else is noise and a distraction in my life. A girl who cheats... that's on her and really has nothing to do with me. It would be her problem. So I'd say bye bye, and move on with MY life. How? Realizing that the relationships I have with anyone do not define who I am. I define me with self respect and the things I enjoy.

Also if you have low self confidence you have more invested in the relationship and more to lose if you brake up because your relationship is a big part of your self worth.  This makes you constantly scared and worried.\n\nLow self confidence can also make you feel like the relationship is not balanced, and that you care more about them than they care about you. In your mind you think that the emotional hold you have over them is not enough to put them off cheating if they meet someone else who they're attracted to. \n\nI think the best way to combat jealously is to first talk to your partner \nand get a reminder from them about how much they really do care about you. Then focus on things that will raise your self confidence. Try new things, go to the gym, challenge yourself,spend time with friends, or maybe meditate. Once you have good self confidence it's hard to get jealous cos you realize they're lucky to have you too and they would have to be stupid to cheat.

I had to see a therapist for years because I didn't want to feel as I had been. At its core, my jealousy was driven by an abusive past, which I never dealt with. How it manifested was terrible. Everyone was out to get me. I always put distance in my relationships so I would be indifferent rather than jealous - a poor strategy for happiness.

The result is no jealousy, and feeling secure enough that if a girl cheats on me, fuck it. Just another opportunity for me to find a better one, or the right one, for me.

That's generally a sign of something more than misplaced jealousy.\n\nIn order to get an honest response however, you have to provide an honest dialectic to begin with. Don't be whiny and don't be aggressive, just be legit, be straight, *\"I've noticed you spending a lot of time with XXXX and I find myself feeling a bit uncomfortable at times with it. I'm not trying to have any impact on what you do, but maybe you could tell me a bit more about that relationship, or we could spend some time together with them so I can get a better feel for them and relax a bit.\"*\n\nThe major other thing to check yourself with is the connection of your jealousy to the situation. Are you specifically jealous of a person? Or are you jealous of every good looking possibility that communicates with your partner. **If you're finding yourself to be jealous about a lot of different people, then either your partner is a giant flirt trying to make you jealous, or you have some major insecurities that need dealing with on your own...** ***(DO NOT TALK TO YOUR PARTNER ABOUT THIS).*** If you are struggling with insecurities, the best thing you can do is analyze why, question your positives, your negatives, what causes you to feel inadequate. Ask yourself why your partner is with you in the first place and maybe talk to some good friends honestly to get a better feel.\n\nIt's important to understand where your Jealousy comes from before addressing it - Inadequate behavior from your Partner?

It was sudden and unexpected, and as I was close with her as well, I offered her a place to stay as I knew she had nowhere to go, and her life was in ruins, also we were close as well due to the fact the 3 of us did alot together.  Over the next couple of months we hecame intimate.  At first things were good.  As time peogressed, I started to feel like I couldnt breath and felt like i couldnt keep my head above water.    Too much to explain and not relevant. I was afraid to talk to her about certain things and she did what a lot of women do, imo, and tried to send signals to which i did not pick up.  Mind you, I am still grieving heavily at the time.  Long story short is that she left me for another dude, and I mean one night slept at my house, next night, had moved on.  Absolutely crushed me even more than I already was from best friends death.\nNow going back to how my friend and I had met her, she was a newly married unhappy girl, who left her husband for my buddy, and then when he left, used me, and lept to another guy, and has since moved to another guy.  I was stupid not to realize who she was in the first place, and especially having intimate knowledge of who she was from my friend confiding in me about her.  However, when we were together, I never in a million years would have thought she would have left me, especially after I wasted my savings taking care of her and giving her a place to stay, food to eat, and show my love by doing all those things, but i think she just really wanted to know that someone else was going to marry and take care of her, of which i was in no place to do considering how soon it was after my friend passed before she told me she was falling in love with me.  I treated her like him, cuz I knew he would never take advantage of someone, and I also would never have expected her to do this as I could never be that cold hearted, but the truth is, there are people out there that are fucking broken, have shitty examples in life,  or have been taught that other shit is whats important in life.\nSo just look at SO character, history, morals, ethics, and above all, if you can't speak to SO about the things that are bothering you, then it is no good anyway.  And if SO blows your concerns off thats no good either.\nMy buddy and I, were just friends, although if he pissed me off and I was not being available or short with him, he would call me on it immediately, and I would do the same with him.  Its hard for people to understand how two hetrosexual men could be such close great friends, but there is great comfort knowing that there is literally someone out there that has your back through anything, who would die for you and someone that you would do the same for as well.

It might be after affects of the divorce coming up and biting you in the butt, or something else that had occurred in that time. \n\nDepression isn't known to start *right after* something major in your life happens. It usually starts with you being sad/upset about something, and then it goes away. It gives you time to rebuild your life and move on. Then after it builds up for months, or even years, it hits you hard. \n\nSame thing happened when my ex boyfriend and I broke up after being together for 6 years.

I sat down a created a list of what I was actually doing and using right now. I asked my 29 year old self what my three goals were for the next 5 years. I considered my strengths and weaknesses and plotted my new course for life. I plotted my course for my new or ongoing destinations and I got rid of everything else.

Separated almost two months now.  Wife and I are maybe a month or so away from filing divorce papers.\n\nI'm a very 'easy going guy'.  The downside of this is that I have a great idea, and sometimes that's enough - I don't pursue it.  My wife was the driven one.  I need to replace that.  Here are some of the things that I'm planning as I start my new life, and plan to be *awesome*, and not turn into a neckbeard version of myself.\n\n1.  Take care of yourself.  Even on a weekend when you may not see anybody.  Get up, shower, shave, every morning.  Go to bed early enough to get enough sleep.  I have to fight this anyways.  It will be hard.  I will do it anyways.\n\n2.  Shake up your routine.  For the first month, every routine item you can identify - do something different.  You go to the same coffee place every day?  Find a new one.  And a new drink, too.  Maybe one with less sugar.  Take a new route to work.  And a third route home.\n\n3.  Physical exercise is a must.  Walk, jog, ride a bike.  On your way back home, remind yourself that this is something important that you have accomplished.\n\n4.  You might need some hobbies.  I am musician, I sing in a group weekly.  I picked up two more.  One is a little bit physical, and gets me out of the house during the daytime.  I'm a math geek, so the other is some very particular statistical research that I've been thinking about for years, and never pursued.\n\n5.  Oh, yeah.  If you live pretty much anywhere in the US or Europe (just a guess!) then it's almost Winter.  Get out of your house while it's light out.  You are descended from ancient peoples who literally worshipped the sun.  Sunlight is powerful, and can change your body chemistry for the better.  Wear sunscreen, especially if you are a pasty white guy like me.\n\n> Lost, adrift, no direction in life despite having what's typically considered a successful life\n\nNo. 6:  Maybe one of those hobbies should be some sort of volunteering.  Something that gives back to the community.  If you want, I can poke your Reddit past for ideas, but you might have something in mind just from me saying this.  If you used to be religious, you might consider getting back there again.\n\n> Missing physical intimacy\n\nNo. 7:  Don't be afraid of giving and accepting hugs.  I am an introverted, reserved, person.  My friends and co-workers have noticed my being huggy.  It's OK.\n\nNo. 8:  I've been meditating for at least 10-15 minutes each day for a year or more, to help with the tension in my marriage.  I can't recommend it enough.

Be more social? Read more? Workout more? What do you WANT? \n\nThen, make very specific plans to reach these goals.

What I later realized is that I was not doing or looking for anything that made me feel fulfilled. Work probably will not make you fulfilled - you need to find something that is yours.\n\nFWIW, personally no medication made me feel better. Instead, I started to be very disciplined in my approach to each day. I made myself get up and dress nice every morning - it's so small but it gave me more confidence and  I felt better.

I'm dealing with that stuff now and have been for the past year, but with me it was the product of heavy psychedelic drug use. Usually it occurs after stressful events in one's life. With kids it's witnessing murder/death/being molested, with adults it could be the loss of a very important person or some PTSD-inflicting event, and finally drug related. \nJudging by you having your life all together and living the \"success\" as defined by Western society, you might be feeling the way you do because your life might not be fulfilling to you on an intrinsic level. You see, as many people there are, as many definitions of success there are. What you have achieved might be the Westerner's dream, but not yours personally. I can't speak much on that regard since nothing much is said about your personal life in the post, but whenever something like an existential crisis happens it comes from the inside and to deal with it one must realize and overcome the senselessness and futility of one's existence. Go out, take a long walk in the evening w/o any electronic gadgets on you. Enjoy the fresh cold winter air, devote a bit of time for yourself. Accept it, you're nearing 30 and life is going to fly by chasing one dream after another.

Only like that can you make sense of everyday life and get the motivation to care and be involved. Once you're done having your time go and get engaged with others.

It's normal and natural to be processing that at times and in ways that don't seem immediately obvious. \n\nA lack of community/social support is correlated to higher rates of depression, loneliness (obviously) and various other things, as well as earlier mortality. \n\nI never realized how important a social support network was until the past year or two. I don't know what your situation is - it sounds like you have a mother you can talk to, which is awesome! However, also having a solid network of friends and community around you who you can be vulnerable and open around is really valuable. I think in a lot of typical western-culture situations, the only people we feel comfortable being close and vulnerable with are our romantic partners, and if we lose that, then life can get very lonely very quickly. And long distance relationships are great, but lack the very human connection of touch. Humans need that shit.

I think it can be perceived as harder once you're a bit older, but the life truth is there are tons of friendly people out there of all ages who are also lonely and want friends. Meetup.com, if you live in a city, is a good place to find friendly groups of all ages also into your interests. \n\nIf you don't already, I'd recommend doing what everyone else here has said - get outside and exercise! Take vitamin D if you're in a northern winter climate currently. Try cutting back on drinking/smoking/substance use if you do those things. Try meditation. Go out and make friends.  But you don't have to start everything, all at once. Pick the one that seems easiest and add it to your life. Then add another. Then another. \n\nAlso, seeing a therapist is probably a good idea. They're not just for people who are suffering intense mental health issues. They'll help you work through your thoughts and facilitate your progress through the \"doldrums\" as you call them far more than a Reddit thread ever will. Be choosy, though.

Separated almost two months now.  Wife and I are maybe a month or so away from filing divorce papers.\n\nI'm a very 'easy going guy'.  The downside of this is that I have a great idea, and sometimes that's enough - I don't pursue it.  My wife was the driven one.  I need to replace that.  Here are some of the things that I'm planning as I start my new life, and plan to be *awesome*, and not turn into a neckbeard version of myself.\n\n1.  Take care of yourself.  Even on a weekend when you may not see anybody.  Get up, shower, shave, every morning.  Go to bed early enough to get enough sleep.  I have to fight this anyways.  It will be hard.  I will do it anyways.\n\n2.  Shake up your routine.  For the first month, every routine item you can identify - do something different.  You go to the same coffee place every day?  Find a new one.  And a new drink, too.  Maybe one with less sugar.  Take a new route to work.  And a third route home.\n\n3.  Physical exercise is a must.  Walk, jog, ride a bike.  On your way back home, remind yourself that this is something important that you have accomplished.\n\n4.  You might need some hobbies.  I am musician, I sing in a group weekly.  I picked up two more.  One is a little bit physical, and gets me out of the house during the daytime.  I'm a math geek, so the other is some very particular statistical research that I've been thinking about for years, and never pursued.\n\n5.  Oh, yeah.  If you live pretty much anywhere in the US or Europe (just a guess!) then it's almost Winter.  Get out of your house while it's light out.  You are descended from ancient peoples who literally worshipped the sun.  Sunlight is powerful, and can change your body chemistry for the better.  Wear sunscreen, especially if you are a pasty white guy like me.\n\n> Lost, adrift, no direction in life despite having what's typically considered a successful life\n\nNo. 6:  Maybe one of those hobbies should be some sort of volunteering.  Something that gives back to the community.  If you want, I can poke your Reddit past for ideas, but you might have something in mind just from me saying this.  If you used to be religious, you might consider getting back there again.\n\n> Missing physical intimacy\n\nNo. 7:  Don't be afraid of giving and accepting hugs.  I am an introverted, reserved, person.  My friends and co-workers have noticed my being huggy.  It's OK.\n\nNo. 8:  I've been meditating for at least 10-15 minutes each day for a year or more, to help with the tension in my marriage.  I can't recommend it enough.  Feelings rise, you feel them, then you release them.  It's a way to help reset your mind.

Seeing a professional will help if you are suffering from depression. \n\nGenerally, I find tips like  'just get over that life is meaningless' or 'just be happy with yourself' as unhelpful and ineffective. \n\nThe first step will be deciding what you want your life to be like - want to paint? Be more social? Read more? Workout more? What do you WANT? \n\nThen, make very specific plans to reach these goals. I.e. instead of saying ' I'm going to work out more,' say ' I'm going to run for 30 min every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the next month.' (or something along these lines). The more specific your plan the better. \n\nBeing able to check off the steps in your plan can make you feel more fulfilled and you'll be working towards what you want. \n\nNot sure what you want? Try signing up for various classes - cooking classes, painting, motorcycle license, etc. Trying new things is always exciting and hopefully it's something that helps you meet more people. Commit to every class you sign up for - be disciplined in attending - and if you don't like it then drop the hobby and move on. \n\nI thought my quarter life crises was about discovering the existential meaning(less) of life. What I later realized is that I was not doing or looking for anything that made me feel fulfilled. Work probably will not make you fulfilled - you need to find something that is yours.\n\nFWIW, personally no medication made me feel better. Instead, I started to be very disciplined in my approach to each day. I made myself get up and dress nice every morning - it's so small but it gave me more confidence and  I felt better.

I'm dealing with that stuff now and have been for the past year, but with me it was the product of heavy psychedelic drug use. Usually it occurs after stressful events in one's life. With kids it's witnessing murder/death/being molested, with adults it could be the loss of a very important person or some PTSD-inflicting event, and finally drug related. \nJudging by you having your life all together and living the \"success\" as defined by Western society, you might be feeling the way you do because your life might not be fulfilling to you on an intrinsic level. You see, as many people there are, as many definitions of success there are. What you have achieved might be the Westerner's dream, but not yours personally. I can't speak much on that regard since nothing much is said about your personal life in the post, but whenever something like an existential crisis happens it comes from the inside and to deal with it one must realize and overcome the senselessness and futility of one's existence.

It's normal and natural to be processing that at times and in ways that don't seem immediately obvious. \n\nA lack of community/social support is correlated to higher rates of depression, loneliness (obviously) and various other things, as well as earlier mortality. \n\nI never realized how important a social support network was until the past year or two. I don't know what your situation is - it sounds like you have a mother you can talk to, which is awesome! However, also having a solid network of friends and community around you who you can be vulnerable and open around is really valuable. I think in a lot of typical western-culture situations, the only people we feel comfortable being close and vulnerable with are our romantic partners, and if we lose that, then life can get very lonely very quickly. And long distance relationships are great, but lack the very human connection of touch. Humans need that shit. I don't even mean romantic connection, necessarily, but just like, physical contact and touch. It does things, in your brain.\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wired-success/201503/8-reasons-why-we-need-human-touch-more-ever\nSo my first recommendation, if you don't already have an awesome friend/community group, is to go out and start trying to make friends. I think it can be perceived as harder once you're a bit older, but the life truth is there are tons of friendly people out there of all ages who are also lonely and want friends. Meetup.com, if you live in a city, is a good place to find friendly groups of all ages also into your interests. \n\nIf you don't already, I'd recommend doing what everyone else here has said - get outside and exercise! Take vitamin D if you're in a northern winter climate currently. Try cutting back on drinking/smoking/substance use if you do those things. Try meditation. Go out and make friends.  But you don't have to start everything, all at once. Pick the one that seems easiest and add it to your life. Then add another. Then another. \n\nAlso, seeing a therapist is probably a good idea. They're not just for people who are suffering intense mental health issues. They'll help you work through your thoughts and facilitate your progress through the \"doldrums\" as you call them far more than a Reddit thread ever will. Be choosy, though. Feel free to visit as many as you need before you find one that \"clicks.\" Research the methods they use, and decide how you feel about those methods. \n\nI hope you find the strength to seek the help that you need.

So it's basically like a cashier position, no where to go to and you'd want more responsiblity but there's no actual growth and this is why I chose to be as slacking as I can, and I actually just felt attrition growing and growing from some coworkers. It's funny though, there were also half who were surprised and sad about this news. It was tough staff, tough environment but you get used to it.\n\nI think what I wanted was a closure that is perfect.

It's funny, I assumed that they would have a week to react and then set a 2 week notice, but the boss just said the exact 2 week end, I thought it was going to be the 15th and was honestly on-point to wait until this date. Until he said it earlier, I was happy that I wouldn't have to stay another long week. But then I was surprised that the email for the party just got sent 5 minutes after coming in. Such a cruel mistress. I am indifferent, but it pisses me off that I wouldn't have had to probably abuse the system more and get that bonus. What was I thinking? I have an early week to start my new life though, but I don't think this is as much of an emotional attachment as it is for wanting to get more. Though it is very daunting to think that I've just been sent out *just like that* after working for years with them.\n\nAnd it's not even as if the bonus is a grand, it's smaller than that but to someone who is venturing out, I am both scared and concerned of how much I will actually need.

You will deal better even if they do nothing.\n\nSecond problem the reaction that you had probably is the thing that bothers you most. As there is a stigma that guys shouldn't cry. This is not true. But the best advice I can give you is never let your haters see they get to you. It is better to just switch off from their critique. In fact it usually works people like this up more as they are looking for a reaction. \nWhen I have an unreasonable boss that did this I would just turn the points they raise into problems they have to solve. \nYou say I'm always fucking late to work? How should we fix that? I accidentally gave a little old lady 50% off her purchase what should we do to stop that from happening. I always smile and let you finish shouting at me before I asked you a question that makes you have to do your job..and that angers you..? Well I can only say that it seems like that's a personal problem not a work related issue.\n\nWhen I do this i stop caring about the person who is saying shit. I literally think. You mean nothing to me. Why would what you say upset me when you are so beneath me it's actually just a game for me to deal with you. And after i have dealt with them I don't dwell on it. I move on and let it go. Some of the worst emotional problems stem from the \"I could have said/done have better\".. it's too late. Let it go and just accept that next time you should be ready to call out a bad situation. Simply saying \"I don't like the way you are talking to me\" is enough. Set your terms. And enforce them. Derail that conversation until they can play at your level. Don't swear, just demand better behaviour.\n\nLastly you are the one that makes yourself feel bad. You keep it in, you don't react, you go over it again later and you build it up into this grand event, guys that 'dont care' literally don't care it isn't an event and they just put it down to \"that guy was a dick..fuck him then\"\nSo drop it and use it as a lesson not as a stick to beat yourself with. \n\nAlso, breath, you can react late and still be ok. there's no such thing as too late to tell someone they are a dick.\n\n"], [1, "There's a difference between criticism and attack and your boss bulldozed that line.\n My main concern for you is that it sounds like you are at maximum stress at all times and events that others might take in stride are enough to tip you over the edge.\nThis can easily slide into a victim mentality wherein you feel powerless and helpless, thus the tears and panic. \n\nAn approach to addressing this might be to expect better for yourself.

I once tried an exercise to sort through  thoughts and problems by drawing three circles. The smallest circle is your circle of control.  In this circle, write down things you actually have control over. For example personal hygiene, fitness, hobbies, saving money. Since you have control over these things they are most important to work on and focus your energy on.\n\nNext draw a bigger circle around the first one. This is your circle of influence. These are things that while you can't control them entirely, you can have some influence. Examples would be local politics, problems of friends or family, drama at work. Since you only have small influence over these things, less energy should he spent on thinking about them. \n\nLastly you have your circle of no control. This is the biggest circle by far. It includes everything else. It includes what other people think and feel, it includes most national and world issues (some people get seriously depressed about these things), it also includes genetic health conditions, layoffs, accidents, etc. While you **do** have control over healthy eating habits, how you drive, your quality of work, you sometimes still get into shit situations that you have no control over nonetheless. \n\nAs things come into your life that vex you, start noticing which circle they belong in, and give those thoughts/issues the appropriate attention. It helps to have a visual so actually draw out these circles and put things into them as they come into your life. \n\nA few observations. You will notice most things that tend to concern you (at first) are outside your circle of control. You have to focus your thoughts on where they can be most useful. At first it's difficult because you're retraining your thoughts. After awhile you start noting how often other people complain about things that are uncontrollable (weather, politics, etc). Try and use the things you do have control over to your advantage by being a stronger person. You might not have a natural talent for music (out of your control) but you can control how often you practice. You can't control your height but you can exercise for better body image and wear slimmer clothing. You can't control unfortunate diseases like cancer but you can control your reactions by supporting an ill loved one and making their life easier.

That can be pulling out your phone and looking at it instead of them, walking out of the room, laughing at them, or anything else that surprises them or helps you not go down the road to being overwhelmed. The key is to give you a way to connect yourself to your surroundings and/or to interrupt the \"bum's rush\" the other person is trying.\n\nPeople who do things like that boss did are seeking to hurt you.

You need that foundation that can say, I still really like who I am and I think I am worth it, I am glad I am me. \n\nTHEN, it gets much easier. For me at least, criticism isnt too difficult to deal with because Im quite honest with myself, and I know when I havent done the best job in the first place. So I already feel a sense of responsibility towards whatever it is that can be criticized. This also keeps my ego in check and I am ready for criticism and my first response is to feel apologetic about my poor performance or whatever it is than to get upset about it. \n\nAlso, when it comes to work related criticism I am even less upset by it, because you have to know, it's part of being a professional. Youre being paid to do something and your work has real life consequences. Criticism is always going to be there and is necessary for you to do better than youre currently doing.

You will have  more time to let it sink in and your emotions will have calmed by then.\n\nBare in mond that the feedback giver often also has a hard time finding the right time and tone to give feedback. This can be quite difficult especially if you already know that the receiver will probably not react well.\n\nIf you follow this you will find that people will give you feedback more often and more directley which will help you improove on things.\n\nYou boss just seems to be an ass, period.", "id": "daqldcj"}], [{"comment": "Just dropping in to say I'm not the least bit surprised that the job where this happened was in research.

We are humans, we have the ability to get used to any and all situations with proper amounts of exposure.  My suggestion is this;  Go to a gym, find either a trainer or gym bro who will meet you everyday at a cirtain time. Be willing to exert yourself, do not go halfway on this. A lot of research has gone into physical fitness and fighting depression and weak willedness. This also helps to boost confidence, because you feel like you can take on the world. \n \n  After that, go to a good fighting gym, boxing or mma. Only need to do this once a week or so.  The reason being is because you are building your body to be useful in crazy situations. You are learning to look imposing and confident. This will help others around you to respect you more, by instilling a little fear and admiration onto them. \n\n next, once you have turned yourself into a glorified shrine of human perfection, Ask a lot of girls out. Get used to rejection. rejection is very close to criticism. Get used to it. get to loving the chase. No one says you have to follow through and actually date the girls who say yes. Do that only if you want to.  This exercise is only for exposing yourself to criticism and rejection.  If you need places to tty it out, just go to a local mall, a grocery store, or and large c9nventions going on. Remember that its numbers that are rhe key, not the results. You want to be rejected over and over again.  Say really silly stuff that makes you feel uncomfortable.

They are not a person, just a problem to be solved. I had a fairly evil teacher in grade school I had to have tutoring with who liked to call me several degrading things. The worst thing I ever did was cry in front of her. So after that day, I told myself that she is not allowed to hurt me. I'm not allowed to feel pained or upset by anything she does because this is a person who is just looking for holes in your armor where they can hurt you. Showing weakness is just giving them an opening.  Defend yourself and your space, but be professional. These kind of people are common in academics so if you're a student your local universities student counseling department probably has someone who specializes.\n\n3) Two books:  Why does he do that? by lundy bancroft. It's about types of abusive men and how they work. It helps a lot to be able to identify the techniques they are using. You are removed from the situtation if you're just observing them like they're an insect. Gaslighting is obvious when you see it. Verbal abuse gets extremely unoriginal after a while. etc.\nThere's also don't take it personally, by elayne savage, but I'm hesitant to recommend that book to other abused people. Just because in my experience it may make you a little to passive and I feel the angry part of me is occasionally the guy saving my ass. \n\n4) Complain, complain often. To anybody who will listen. If the guy is saying he'll kill you. I'd legit walk in and say you're afraid he means it.... worried about him shooting up the place. He's threatened so many others.

The superior takes aside and puts you down. At that point you should have reacted. If you where going to leave you could have took him/her aside and said \"I quit, I am quitting because you lack the ability to treat me as a person, and I can't work under someone I don't respect\" walk away and don't wait for a reply. Even if it's late you have vented something. You can even write an email detailing why you left now. Send it to your Boss and cc their boss, keep it professional. You will deal better even if they do nothing.\n\nSecond problem the reaction that you had probably is the thing that bothers you most. As there is a stigma that guys shouldn't cry. This is not true. But the best advice I can give you is never let your haters see they get to you. It is better to just switch off from their critique. In fact it usually works people like this up more as they are looking for a reaction. \nWhen I have an unreasonable boss that did this I would just turn the points they raise into problems they have to solve. \nYou say I'm always fucking late to work? How should we fix that? I accidentally gave a little old lady 50% off her purchase what should we do to stop that from happening. I always smile and let you finish shouting at me before I asked you a question that makes you have to do your job..and that angers you..? Well I can only say that it seems like that's a personal problem not a work related issue.\n\nWhen I do this i stop caring about the person who is saying shit. I literally think. You mean nothing to me. Why would what you say upset me when you are so beneath me it's actually just a game for me to deal with you. And after i have dealt with them I don't dwell on it. I move on and let it go. Some of the worst emotional problems stem from the \"I could have said/done have better\".. it's too late. Let it go and just accept that next time you should be ready to call out a bad situation. Simply saying \"I don't like the way you are talking to me\" is enough. Set your terms. And enforce them. Derail that conversation until they can play at your level. Don't swear, just demand better behaviour.\n\nLastly you are the one that makes yourself feel bad. You keep it in, you don't react, you go over it again later and you build it up into this grand event, guys that 'dont care' literally don't care it isn't an event and they just put it down to \"that guy was a dick..fuck him then\"\nSo drop it and use it as a lesson not as a stick to beat yourself with. \n\nAlso, breath, you can react late and still be ok. there's no such thing as too late to tell someone they are a dick.\n\n", "id": "daqn35w"}], [{"comment": "There's a difference between criticism and attack and your boss bulldozed that line.\n My main concern for you is that it sounds like you are at maximum stress at all times and events that others might take in stride are enough to tip you over the edge.\nThis can easily slide into a victim mentality wherein you feel powerless and helpless, thus the tears and panic. \n\nAn approach to addressing this might be to expect better for yourself.

I once tried an exercise to sort through  thoughts and problems by drawing three circles. The smallest circle is your circle of control.  In this circle, write down things you actually have control over. For example personal hygiene, fitness, hobbies, saving money. Since you have control over these things they are most important to work on and focus your energy on.\n\nNext draw a bigger circle around the first one. This is your circle of influence. These are things that while you can't control them entirely, you can have some influence. Examples would be local politics, problems of friends or family, drama at work. Since you only have small influence over these things, less energy should he spent on thinking about them. \n\nLastly you have your circle of no control. This is the biggest circle by far. It includes everything else. It includes what other people think and feel, it includes most national and world issues (some people get seriously depressed about these things), it also includes genetic health conditions, layoffs, accidents, etc. While you **do** have control over healthy eating habits, how you drive, your quality of work, you sometimes still get into shit situations that you have no control over nonetheless. \n\nAs things come into your life that vex you, start noticing which circle they belong in, and give those thoughts/issues the appropriate attention. It helps to have a visual so actually draw out these circles and put things into them as they come into your life. \n\nA few observations. You will notice most things that tend to concern you (at first) are outside your circle of control. You have to focus your thoughts on where they can be most useful. At first it's difficult because you're retraining your thoughts. After awhile you start noting how often other people complain about things that are uncontrollable (weather, politics, etc). Try and use the things you do have control over to your advantage by being a stronger person. You might not have a natural talent for music (out of your control) but you can control how often you practice. You can't control your height but you can exercise for better body image and wear slimmer clothing.

That reddit has at least 1 personal bank account, likely one business revolving credit line, one business checking account, a payroll account, and a trust account for any subcontractors hired for his jobs. That person might control a couple hundred grand in several accounts.

He maintains a $700,000.00 line of credit with a bank and once crops are sold, receives hundreds of thousands of dollars all at one time - pays back the line of credit, and end up pocketing about $80,000.00 at the end of the year - but the bank makes quite a lot of money off him between planting and harvest.  \n\nIn other words, people who you would not associate with money may in fact have a lot of it at any given moment and/or may be the major profit centers for a bank.\n\nMy law firm maintains about $750,000.00, in the payroll account each month in order to ensure we pay all of our employees on time.  Retainers from clients are in an IOLTA account that has at any given time about $800,000.00 to a million.\n\nThen we have the operating account which maintains about $250,000.00 in it to cover lease payments, office supplies, paying the water guy, LexisNexis bills, employee reimbursable expenses, etc.\n\nSo just my little mid-sized firm in Dallas, Tx maintains about $2 million in accounts with Frost Bank.  I'm quite sure there are at least 10,000 other companies with similiar holdings... All the sudden your $10 million becomes $20 billion.

But I've never been closer to my dad than I am now. A lot of this has to do with finances though. After selling our old house, we were able to pay off every debt and now my parents individually make a ton of money. My life got a lot better after the divorce honestly, but your situation might be different. There is no one answer for how to deal with it. The changes are going to fly at you fast and I suggest you roll with the punches. Go with the flow. Everyone in your family will be going through their own thing.

My parents were also about to have a divorce but they stayed together in the hopes I would still grow up a Christian as they had. They knew that children of divorced parents are much more likely to end up in jail, on drugs, bankruptcy, pretty much everything is against them. My parents and I both grew up in the church, Church of Christ. Their plans worked out and I grew up having a somewhat normal life, despite my father being depressed all the time. ( I was born a year and a half after my sister passed away in a car accident in '87, so that is where the depression stems from.) I knew that I had a place in this world. My parents were at the edge of divorce because they did argue a lot, and both suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and severe depression. Some of that has passed onto me. \n\nAnyway, back to where being involved in a church helps. Right, so taking part in church activities and getting to make friends in the church is what kept my parents together and is what has helped me continue on in my own depression. Being a part of a church family is something that you can't get anywhere else. They are there for you in any scenario, just like a real family. My mother went through knee replacement surgery when I was young and they knew my dad didn't cook, so different church families brought us 3 home cooked meals every day until she recovered. We didn't even ask them to! That is just one random example. My point is that if you can find a 1st century church (still practices what the Bibles says) in the 21st century (invites everyone inside, regardless of race, income, past mistakes, etc), you are in good hands. So many people despise churches and Christians now and I can understand where some of them are coming from. Being a christian is not putting people down and telling them they're going to hell for having an abortion. Being a christian is quite simply living your daily life but with a kind heart, doing what you can each day to help people, and trying your best to abide by what the Bible says. Sure we're human and we make mistakes and that's OK, just don't think that it's OK to keep making the same mistake over and over again. A GOOD church will want to hear your story and help you through this time and years down the road. Do not let this unfortunate event slow you down. You are a very special person and you deserve all the loving hearts you can get. I hate to say you will face many more trials in life that will try to break you. How you react to them is what will make all the difference. Many people turn to alcohol, drugs, porn, over eating, over spending, all kinds of stuff. Those are ways to put a used bandage on an open wound. It will hurt you more later. A change of heart that you can get from a church is a very real cure for so many things. I have seen it time and time again. My friend who almost died in elementary school and had to go through a very serious bone marrow transplant, is now our worship leader on Sundays. My other friend who had his parents split up when he was young and while in college his mother passed away. Amazingly two years later he switched his major from Aeronautical Engineering to Ministry to become a pastor in order to help others through time in need, just as so many people helped him that were members of our church. I have dozens of other stories but those are my most memorable.\n\nSorry, I was all over the place in writing this, I was mainly speaking from my heart and not paying much attention to paragraph or sentence structure :P\n\nI hope you can find peace during this time.

Throw away because I suspect people I know know my real account and this is personal \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo my parents divorced when I was 7 (not a teenager but I have lived through my teenage years with it so I feel qualified to answer!!) and I'm now 21. It really depends on how the breakup goes on the initial few months / years. After that things will settle down and life goes on. Ill quickly talk about a few things that I struggled with / are important to know\n\nFirst up Christmas... Im sorry to say but Christmas is going to be hard. Both your parents will likely be alone (e.g. no partner) and therefore desperate for you to spend Christmas Day with them. Its going to be tough deciding who you're going to have Christmas dinner with and trying not to upset either of them. If one of them does have a new partner already then I would suggest spending Christmas with the one that would otherwise be alone! This year I'm having Christmas lunch at my mothers then heading over for Christmas dinner at my fathers. Get used to eating a lot.\n\nThe flip side is that you're going to get shit loads of presents and shit loads of Christmas food...\n\nI found it hard as for a long time my parents wouldn't speak. I found it easier to compartmentalise each parent into completely separate lives. When I saw my dad, I was one person, my mother another. Nothing crossed over and I still struggle when those two worlds do collide! Now I'm not saying this is healthy behaviour but it certainly helped me get through it and make sense of it all. It also helped me avoid conversations about the other parent, which in hindsight was a good move. It meant I want in the middle of their problems or acting as an intermediary. So yeah I suggest you avoid saying \"oh mum was doing this...\" and just focus on spending time with your dad and vice versa.\n\nAnother issue I had to deal with is the conflict. To this day my grandparents on my mums side don't like my dad and vice versa. You have to remember that your mum is your mothers side grandparents child and they will be super protective of her. The same goes for your dad and both sets of grandparents will view their Childs partner as the one who fucked up their Childs life! (its never their own Childs fault.) If this is the case then you may just have to grow a thick skin. Don't think less of either parent because your grandparents no longer like them. Don't let that jeopardise your relationship with your parents. \n\nFinally, I spent a long time not talking to my father after he left. In hindsight it was stupid but at the time I felt like I was the problem. Without sound cliche you aren't the problem so don't let whats happen affect your relationship with your parents. \n\nLastly, one thing I found in my personal life is that people judge you on so many levels. People will judge a single mum and don't let that be the case. My mother raised me well and never failed to provide what I needed (and loads of other fun stuff). The single mum stereotype is not true (in all cases). I also had one of my girlfriends fathers ask me If I would ever do the same to his daughter. He thought it might run in the family... stand up for yourself and don't let your parents choices set a precedent for you. \n\nGood luck, its not as bad as it seems !! "], [2, "You're going to be okay but there will be some inconveniences in your future. You'll likely be staying with one parent for several days then the other parent on the weekend. This means a lot of going back and forth which can seem unsettling. Just try to make the best of it and keep yourself organized so you don't forget things at once place that you need at the other. It hurts now but it will get better especially if you keep yourself flexible. There may be new opportunities for you so it won't be all bad.

I struggled with it all for some time and along the way found my self getting pretty reckless with partying, drugs, and fighting. Luckily I caught myself on the downward slope and went to talk to a therapist. When I first showed up I had no idea what to say but therapists have a way of prodding it out of you.

But just like a breakup that you or your friend may have had, this is going to be hard on them - harder, actually - and it's important to keep that in mind.\n\nFraming their emotions, actions, words in this way will help you make sense of things easier and keep you from placing blame on yourself or hating your parents. Imagine your parents as your two best friends in the whole world, who started dating, and now they just broke up - but both want to still be friends with you. You should navigate it like that - making sure you don't pick sides or take negative comments from one parent about the other parent as fact (they're going to say/do a lot irrationally because they're hurting and trying to navigate that pain).\n\nJust like any friend you need to be there for them and give them as much love as you can.

My mother is putting our house on the market in May. I have lived there since I was four. I asked my siblings if they would like to make a video with me going room to room and talking about some memories we have for each part of the house.

You don't necessarily have to do that, as it is going to be time-consuming, but taking some time to appreciate your home for what is has been and talking to someone about it may allow you to transition.\n\nI would also recommend trying to avoid becoming the person your parents vent to about the situation. A divorce is easier if you are able to continue your relationship amicably with both parents. My father had an affair and while I don't approve at all, it is extremely draining and difficult to listen to my mother talk about it-- which she does because she is very hurt. Your parents may or may not do this, but if they do, sit down and have a very calm and civil conversation that shows how this affects you. Make it clear that you understand why they are turning to you, but recommend other resources that would be more appropriate and allow you each to heal more easily.\n\nMy sister is currently 17 and living at home with our mother. She spends time separately with each parent and tries to encourage my mother to get out of the house and do things. So don't get stuck in a rut-- keep engaging in life, and keep a routine, even if it's hard. What are some things you do now that you can keep doing as you move, etc.? Do you take a warm bath before bed? Do you start the day with some yoga? Do you take an hour to relax after school before beginning homework? Find normalcy where you can, push yourself to engage in your life. It's hard to do when you are depressed and having trouble coping, but you have to make yourself do it.\n\nGood luck.

It's a hard thing to manage (they'll both be sensitive about things, and want YOU to understand THEIR, and only their, side, and it might hurt their feelings if you don't do it politely/nicely/gently), but it's very important, as it will help you maintain a good working relationship with both your parents.

So please don't hate me if I say something wrong. (feel free to correct me, though!)\nAs you probably know, someone with a bipolar disorder has periods of being depressed,\nbut also periods of being manic.\nI have some experience with bipolar people, and what the DSM V (the big book of mental illness) explains about the manic periods, is that people no longer think straight.\nA friend of mine is bipolar, and turns into a huge asshole when manic. It's like I'm talking to a completely different person. I asked him once about it, and he said that somewhere in the back of his mind he knows that what he's doing is fucked up (for example, he has terribly hurt some of his friends by saying major asshole things to them, playing around with cocaine, pissing on a cop car...), but he somehow just doesn't register it, and most importantly, doesn't care. At all. He only realises what he's done when he eventually\nsnaps out of his manic period. Of course by then, it's too late.\nAgain, I don't know what happens with your dad when this happens. These manic periods are different for each person. Some people can go into psychosis, some people just spend excessive amounts of money, some people are suddenly convinced they can fly.\nThen there's the depression part. This is where I have personal experience. And this is the other part of \"too sick to realise\" I'd like to tell you about.\nI have had depression since I was about ten years old, so I have been this way for the most part of my life. Of course I realise I'm sick, but I can't feel that I'm sick.\nThis is what I know. This is my normal. I couldn't explain to you what \"generally happy\" people feel. I only know that the way I feel is not how it's supposed to be.\nI think if someone cast a spell on me, taking away my depression, I'd be horrified. I would not have a clue what the hell is suddenly wrong with me, for I do not know \"normal\". I think normal would feel very weird, and very wrong for me, simply because I wouldn't know what I'm dealing with.\nThis is the part where I don't realise how sick I am. For me it's normal to hate myself, to feel miserable, to be afraid to talk or befriend someone because I'd just annoy them. It's completely normal for me to want to hurt myself (or worse).

My parents were also about to have a divorce but they stayed together in the hopes I would still grow up a Christian as they had. They knew that children of divorced parents are much more likely to end up in jail, on drugs, bankruptcy, pretty much everything is against them. My parents and I both grew up in the church, Church of Christ. Their plans worked out and I grew up having a somewhat normal life, despite my father being depressed all the time. ( I was born a year and a half after my sister passed away in a car accident in '87, so that is where the depression stems from.) I knew that I had a place in this world. My parents were at the edge of divorce because they did argue a lot, and both suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and severe depression. Some of that has passed onto me. \n\nAnyway, back to where being involved in a church helps. Right, so taking part in church activities and getting to make friends in the church is what kept my parents together and is what has helped me continue on in my own depression. Being a part of a church family is something that you can't get anywhere else. They are there for you in any scenario, just like a real family. My mother went through knee replacement surgery when I was young and they knew my dad didn't cook, so different church families brought us 3 home cooked meals every day until she recovered. We didn't even ask them to! That is just one random example. My point is that if you can find a 1st century church (still practices what the Bibles says) in the 21st century (invites everyone inside, regardless of race, income, past mistakes, etc), you are in good hands. So many people despise churches and Christians now and I can understand where some of them are coming from. Being a christian is not putting people down and telling them they're going to hell for having an abortion. Being a christian is quite simply living your daily life but with a kind heart, doing what you can each day to help people, and trying your best to abide by what the Bible says. Sure we're human and we make mistakes and that's OK, just don't think that it's OK to keep making the same mistake over and over again. A GOOD church will want to hear your story and help you through this time and years down the road. Do not let this unfortunate event slow you down. You are a very special person and you deserve all the loving hearts you can get. I hate to say you will face many more trials in life that will try to break you. How you react to them is what will make all the difference. Many people turn to alcohol, drugs, porn, over eating, over spending, all kinds of stuff. Those are ways to put a used bandage on an open wound. It will hurt you more later. A change of heart that you can get from a church is a very real cure for so many things. I have seen it time and time again. My friend who almost died in elementary school and had to go through a very serious bone marrow transplant, is now our worship leader on Sundays. My other friend who had his parents split up when he was young and while in college his mother passed away.

And you know what, you are right. My mother has explained to me countless times almost exactly what you said, that it is my birth that kept them going. I didn't mention it earlier but my mother asked her doctors about having another child. She was 44 at the time! They all recommended against having another child as it could be detrimental to the mother and newborn, and the possibility of birth defects would skyrocket because of her age. Either by amazing coincidence or perhaps an answered prayer, she said I was her easiest pregnancy and that I never really got sick as a child, and rarely cried compared to other kids. And to be honest, what kept me going sometimes was that I knew of the broken hearts my parents had already experienced and I couldn't put them through another loss. What gives me the most strength to continue and make better decisions is my ultimate goal to someday meet my sister for the first time, in heaven. I know that's not going to happen if I take my own life, and thanks to some mild medications I can control my anger and depression very well. I can also say I enjoy life now! I wouldn't say that 5 years ago. I would almost say that a person like me going through depression is pathetic, seeing as I had mostly everything handed to me growing up. I eventually realized that some kids at my school didn't have money for lunch, others whose father left them at birth, are in jail, or worse.

Throw away because I suspect people I know know my real account and this is personal \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo my parents divorced when I was 7 (not a teenager but I have lived through my teenage years with it so I feel qualified to answer!!) and I'm now 21. It really depends on how the breakup goes on the initial few months / years. After that things will settle down and life goes on. Ill quickly talk about a few things that I struggled with / are important to know\n\nFirst up Christmas... Im sorry to say but Christmas is going to be hard. Both your parents will likely be alone (e.g. no partner) and therefore desperate for you to spend Christmas Day with them. Its going to be tough deciding who you're going to have Christmas dinner with and trying not to upset either of them. If one of them does have a new partner already then I would suggest spending Christmas with the one that would otherwise be alone! This year I'm having Christmas lunch at my mothers then heading over for Christmas dinner at my fathers. Get used to eating a lot.\n\nThe flip side is that you're going to get shit loads of presents and shit loads of Christmas food...\n\nI found it hard as for a long time my parents wouldn't speak. I found it easier to compartmentalise each parent into completely separate lives. When I saw my dad, I was one person, my mother another. Nothing crossed over and I still struggle when those two worlds do collide! Now I'm not saying this is healthy behaviour but it certainly helped me get through it and make sense of it all. It also helped me avoid conversations about the other parent, which in hindsight was a good move. It meant I want in the middle of their problems or acting as an intermediary. So yeah I suggest you avoid saying \"oh mum was doing this...\" and just focus on spending time with your dad and vice versa.\n\nAnother issue I had to deal with is the conflict. To this day my grandparents on my mums side don't like my dad and vice versa. You have to remember that your mum is your mothers side grandparents child and they will be super protective of her. The same goes for your dad and both sets of grandparents will view their Childs partner as the one who fucked up their Childs life! (its never their own Childs fault.) If this is the case then you may just have to grow a thick skin. Don't think less of either parent because your grandparents no longer like them. Don't let that jeopardise your relationship with your parents. \n\nFinally, I spent a long time not talking to my father after he left. In hindsight it was stupid but at the time I felt like I was the problem. Without sound cliche you aren't the problem so don't let whats happen affect your relationship with your parents. \n\nLastly, one thing I found in my personal life is that people judge you on so many levels. People will judge a single mum and don't let that be the case. My mother raised me well and never failed to provide what I needed (and loads of other fun stuff). The single mum stereotype is not true (in all cases). I also had one of my girlfriends fathers ask me If I would ever do the same to his daughter. He thought it might run in the family... stand up for yourself and don't let your parents choices set a precedent for you. \n\nGood luck, its not as bad as it seems !!

After all, it has its uses for some aspects of life, but obviously it is a hard obstacle for schoolwork and other important activities.\n\nIMO, there are really three sides to this coin: mental, physical, and chemical (or as many may also interpret it, \"body, mind, spirit\" though for my purposes here I would argue that mind and spirit are encompassed by \"mental\").\n\n1. Mental - you really do have to train your brain for some activities, and the only way to do so is via disciplined repetition of tasks, no matter how mundane or complex.  The more you actually do something, the easier it becomes.  You build up walls in your mind about a task, thinking about how hard it is, but upon actually doing the task you will realize that it is not as difficult as you thought.  As with anything, it will consume TIME to do this.  That's the biggest obstacle I have found to mental training - spending the time to actually establish the patterns as habits.\n\n2. Physical - anyone will tell you, if you're physically out of shape or otherwise inactive/sedentary in your lifestyle, it will play a huge role in your motivation to perform even simple tasks.  If you realize that exercise is worthwhile, you can convince your body more easily to perform tasks which you might otherwise delay.  Often the root of procrastination is the preparation or the movement involved (e.g., I don't wanna wash the car because I have to pull out the hose and the buckets and sponges and it's a lot of work before I actually even do the job I want to do).  When your body is physically fit and energetic, the simple tasks before the actual task become much more of a no-brainer and result in less mental hesitation to set about performing the task at hand.\n\n3. Chemical - This is where I suspect many may disagree, but there is a very specific reason for laziness in many people, and it can be related to neurochemical (im)balances.  I am not advocating that you use illegal drugs by any means, but some specific drugs can tip the scale and activate your inner motivation, even in small doses or at specific times of the day.

After all, it has its uses for some aspects of life, but obviously it is a hard obstacle for schoolwork and other important activities.\n\nIMO, there are really three sides to this coin: mental, physical, and chemical (or as many may also interpret it, \"body, mind, spirit\" though for my purposes here I would argue that mind and spirit are encompassed by \"mental\").\n\n1. Mental - you really do have to train your brain for some activities, and the only way to do so is via disciplined repetition of tasks, no matter how mundane or complex.  The more you actually do something, the easier it becomes.  You build up walls in your mind about a task, thinking about how hard it is, but upon actually doing the task you will realize that it is not as difficult as you thought.  As with anything, it will consume TIME to do this.  That's the biggest obstacle I have found to mental training - spending the time to actually establish the patterns as habits.\n\n2. Physical - anyone will tell you, if you're physically out of shape or otherwise inactive/sedentary in your lifestyle, it will play a huge role in your motivation to perform even simple tasks.  If you realize that exercise is worthwhile, you can convince your body more easily to perform tasks which you might otherwise delay.  Often the root of procrastination is the preparation or the movement involved (e.g., I don't wanna wash the car because I have to pull out the hose and the buckets and sponges and it's a lot of work before I actually even do the job I want to do).  When your body is physically fit and energetic, the simple tasks before the actual task become much more of a no-brainer and result in less mental hesitation to set about performing the task at hand.\n\n3. Chemical - This is where I suspect many may disagree, but there is a very specific reason for laziness in many people, and it can be related to neurochemical (im)balances.  I am not advocating that you use illegal drugs by any means, but some specific drugs can tip the scale and activate your inner motivation, even in small doses or at specific times of the day.  Why do you think so many people drink coffee in the morning?  Caffeine is a drug which stimulates the central nervous system.  Make no mistake about it, some substances or chemicals will have completely positive effects upon your motivation.

Take them one by one and start practicing them until you become average, or if you wish until you become good at them.\n\nIt's the same with anxiety and growing confidence, you have to do the things that scares you, to overcome them.\n\nAnother way to deal with inferiority complexes is to accept that you will never be good at some things without extreme hard work on that subject.\n\nPersonally, I'd say a ratio of 2 to 1, respectevly 2 for becoming better and 1 to accept your inadequacy is a good standard.\n\nYou have to accept the fact that you will not be able to be good at everything. Each and everyone of us is good at some things and average or less than that at others.\n\nFor example a ceetah can't hunt the same way as a lion does. But is more flexible, more agile than a lion will ever be. Meanwhile, for hyenas, they aren't the strongest ones, but there is strength in numbers and with it they can overcone even lions.\n\nThus, accepting some of your flaws and becoming better at the other ones will help you develop confidence, a good self-esteem, your personality will grow as well and your own sense of self worth will develop into a GOOD one.\n\n\n\nNow let's talk about superiority complex. \n\nWhen you've got this complex, you're acting arrogant towards others. You have to start becoming more humble and accept that others are not perfect, they have weak spots and strong ones. Just as you do, as I've explained earlier.\n\nYou won't want to go racing with a jeep, just as you won't want to climb mountains with a sports car on an uneven terrain.\n\nFrom personal experience, by spending time with a girlfriend I was able to overcome this complex since women are more empathic than men are and less ego centered.\n\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to PM me or reply in this thread.

For example, if I'm very hungry and there's 1 cake left, I'll take that cake, and ill TRY to take that cake before you did. \n\nI give credit where credit is due. If I nail a job, you KNOW I will be out there yelling  \"hey check this shut out, I nailed this fucking job\". When other nailed their jobs, I'll praise them the proper level of praise they should receive, so that they feel appreciated, and when the person feel appreciate they will come to appreciate you back.

I'm only speaking as someone that dealt with an inferiority complex elementary through high school, and as a philosophy undergrad. Furthermore, some of what I have to say might offend you. I want you to know that isn't my intention. I don't know you and can't judge your character. These are just my thoughts on the few lines of text that I've read from you and it's purely from a place of wanting you to feel like you better understand the situation.\n\nI've known people with superiority complexes in the past and I can't say I've found a way to \"conquer\" the issue so to speak. That in itself is the means by which you can make this a non-issue for yourself. What I mean by that is that you'll never \"fix\" this person (and you shouldn't feel that you need to). No matter what they say or do they will always find themselves superior to you. What's key to understand here is that this notion of their being superior to you exists purely in their perception, and in this case your perception. That feeling that they are superior to you bothers you because you know they feel it. That is to say that your feeling of inferiority is seemingly dependent on that guy feeling that he's better than you. So the part that's bothering you is your own perception that you are indeed inferior to him. This perception is just that, a perception. It exists within your mind. Next, ask yourself why it matters. Does it really matter that he's stronger than you? Does it really matter that he has more money than you? No, his being strong or whatnot has no bearing on the quality of your life. Your life exists as it does with or without him. You have you friends, and you have your family. You have your goals and desires in life. Next time you hear him boasting about how great he is just remember that 1)His thinking he's superior to others exists primarily in his head. And 2)it doesn't matter to your life. \n\nBut it can be difficult to just say it's only in my head. As someone who spent many earlier years with an inferiority complex I can understand that it isn't that easy to just \"ignore\" it. Feelings of inferiority come from comparing yourself to others. It's easy to see all the other people who are hotter, smarter, wealthier, stronger than you are. Each of those attributes has a spectrum from least to most. Everyone lays somewhere on each of those spectrums. What you need to understand is that there will always be people below you and there will always be people ahead of you. The cards fall, for the most part, as they may. You can't make yourself more intelligent. You can't just make yourself more money. The only thing you can do is be grateful for what you have (even if it's only a little), work to improve yourself, and judge yourself based on your progress.\n\nI don't know if you're religious or not, but the way I see I've got one life. The cards have been dealt to me, and crying about it for the earlier years of my life did nothing but make me feel worse. I work to improve myself in areas that I care about because they're important to me, not because I ought to be better than someone else. I started working on my physical fitness, I study a topic that I care about and I push myself to understand it better than I did last year. I try to dress better to work with my body type. When you focus on yourself and your progress with everything, you learn to take a little bit of pride in what you've worked for. And where other people are at seems a little less important. When I see someone at the climbing gym that sends more challenging routes than I can, I don't feel inferior. Because what I have is knowledge of where I'm at, and how hard I've worked to get there, and I'm proud of that progress.\n\nPeople will act superior to you when they don't respect you. How can you expect their respect if you don't respect you. Fuck em, even if they're a coworker. Let him have his way, let him be right. Why? Cause it doesn't matter, you've got more important things to worry about in your life than some dude who thinks he's better than you.\n\nStudy hard, exercise hard, play hard. Whatever you do, put effort into it. The cards are already dealt, so play your hand and play it well. You won't be given that victory, you have to work for it.  \n\nEdit: I sort of misread your question but it all still applies.

But so many times people get caught up in trying to decode another person's behavior and how it impacts *them* without stopping to think that the other person is more than likely thinking about themselves. \n\nA simple example which I can't verify the veracity of: I used to be late to school all the time as a kid. I was embarrassed by the awkward quiet and stares that would ensue from the rest of the 8 year olds whose parents/guardians brought them to school on time. My mom told me, 'they're just glad they aren't the late ones and that's all they're thinking about' when I told her how uncomfortable it made me feel. \n\nSo like I said, that may not be true but it helped me feel more at ease and like I wasn't being judged by others. I apply that to a lot of interactions in life. Things are simpler when you realize people everyone around is thinking about and dealing with their own shit, too and most of it probably doesn't have to do with you. \n\nFor people with a superiority complex, realize they are likely very insecure/have low self esteem hence why they feel the need to put others down and put themselves on their very imaginary pedestal.

I was embarrassed by the awkward quiet and stares that would ensue from the rest of the 8 year olds whose parents/guardians brought them to school on time. My mom told me, 'they're just glad they aren't the late ones and that's all they're thinking about' when I told her how uncomfortable it made me feel. \n\nSo like I said, that may not be true but it helped me feel more at ease and like I wasn't being judged by others. I apply that to a lot of interactions in life. Things are simpler when you realize people everyone around is thinking about and dealing with their own shit, too and most of it probably doesn't have to do with you. \n\nFor people with a superiority complex, realize they are likely very insecure/have low self esteem hence why they feel the need to put others down and put themselves on their very imaginary pedestal.

Even if it's a friend rather than an adult you could tell them what work you have to do when you get home, try to do it, and then send them photos showing you've done it.

"], [1, "I graduated high school with a GPA of 2.7 and received a perfect score on my ACT exam when I was a senior. My guidance counselor looked at my GPA and always told me that I'm smarter than that. The thing was that I didn't care about schoolwork AT ALL and felt it was pointless to prove to someone else that I knew the material. I went on to college, and did better there because I had to pay for it. I felt no repercussions during high school, but in college it was painfully different. I didn't try to motivate myself until halfway thru my freshman year in college, and so I'll give you some things that managed to work for me.\n\nRewards - This was a huge thing, and is the highest comment here. Pick a task, and reward yourself for doing. Let's say every 15 minutes of schoolwork is turned into 5 minutes of gaming. I am an avid gamer, and decided internally that I can only do a certain amount of gaming for a certain amount of schoolwork. I also would urge you to get your parents involved with rewarding you for good work if your parents would be willing. My mother just yelled at me a lot, and negative reinforcement doesn't help. If your mother/father is willing to do positive reinforcement via rewards for work, then you're likely going to be able to motivate yourself more.\n\nScheduled Tasks and Breaks - Get out a calendar and notch out time for your schoolwork along with breaks for it. You'll know when is a good time for you (afternoon, early evening, late evening, etc.), but you need to make sure you schedule it in. Set reminders for yourself. Set increments of time aside (5-15 minutes) of dedicated work alongside of breaks. You won't get anywhere if you say to yourself that you're going to do nothing but schoolwork until it's completed. Make sure to take breaks.\n\nDiet - Some foods are going to give you better motivation than other foods. Things that are high in sugar content (processed food, candy, fast food, etc.) are going to zap your motivation very easily. If your family typically hands you food and you eat it, ask them to buy you more fruits. Fruits are great to making you feel better, and if you feel better you'll likely be more motivated to do the work. I changed my diet during college, and I just felt great by cutting out sugar. I went full vegetarian and I feel so much different now than I did when I was a teen. You'd be surprised how much sugar you're likely consuming, and sugar zaps your motivation in a harsh way.\n\nI wish you luck, and encourage you to continue to ask for more advice if these kinds of things don't manage to help you."], [1, "Plan out you day. Find out what causes the depression and use tools.such as family and friends to overcome if "], [1, "I had a similar issue in high school; especially my junior year which is supposedly the end all be all for college. I was recommended to a social worker at my high school because of the sudden lack of effort that I could not give good reason for. I was lucky to have ended up getting to the university I wanted despite almost failing a class that year. Now that I'm better, I study (my job requires continual knowledge improvement) like a champ and am actually better than many of my peers who were always \"A\" students. \n\nA lot of the posts above mention going to a coffee shop and just sitting there and getting work done. This is a popular strategy for the aforementioned \"A\" students who didn't have the motivation issues we have had. The social worker I had a few sessions with also had the \"small victories - small rewards\" challenge as her premier solution to my problem. None of this got me going. It's a depressing cycle too. Set goals for small victories then repeatedly fail them.\n\nObviously, part of getting better was just growing out of it. (Being a teenager sucks in many ways to include hormonally despite your intelligence). However, what I also did was find some sort of thing that would finally motivate me to perform to what I perceive is the standard I should have. \n\nWhat worked for me was studying and working hard enough so that I could effectively participate in group study. Have you tried getting together with a two or three classmates and setting up group study to hold you accountable? Remember, don't go to big with the group or it will turn into a hangout sesh. Building from that, I started to work hard enough so that I could help other people that were struggling. Is there anyone else in your classes feeling similarly? Maybe your goal can be to help them? Don't do one on one studying with them if you're not ready though, you might just not study and be distracted by talking about your similar situation. Maybe include them in the first group. Finally, I was able to transition to studying for me, to keep up the same standard that I set with previous methods. \n\nYour motivators do not have to be these; find what works for you. The goal is to start working hard because you deserve. Never rely on doing it for someone else because as soon as that person fails you, you have a reason to quit. You never have a reason to quit on yourself. You only get this time of free education with plenty of time to seek your own hobbies once.

", "id": "dam9lou"}], [{"comment": "I graduated high school with a GPA of 2.7 and received a perfect score on my ACT exam when I was a senior. My guidance counselor looked at my GPA and always told me that I'm smarter than that. The thing was that I didn't care about schoolwork AT ALL and felt it was pointless to prove to someone else that I knew the material. I went on to college, and did better there because I had to pay for it. I felt no repercussions during high school, but in college it was painfully different. I didn't try to motivate myself until halfway thru my freshman year in college, and so I'll give you some things that managed to work for me.\n\nRewards - This was a huge thing, and is the highest comment here. Pick a task, and reward yourself for doing. Let's say every 15 minutes of schoolwork is turned into 5 minutes of gaming. I am an avid gamer, and decided internally that I can only do a certain amount of gaming for a certain amount of schoolwork. I also would urge you to get your parents involved with rewarding you for good work if your parents would be willing. My mother just yelled at me a lot, and negative reinforcement doesn't help. If your mother/father is willing to do positive reinforcement via rewards for work, then you're likely going to be able to motivate yourself more.\n\nScheduled Tasks and Breaks - Get out a calendar and notch out time for your schoolwork along with breaks for it. You'll know when is a good time for you (afternoon, early evening, late evening, etc.), but you need to make sure you schedule it in. Set reminders for yourself. Set increments of time aside (5-15 minutes) of dedicated work alongside of breaks. You won't get anywhere if you say to yourself that you're going to do nothing but schoolwork until it's completed. Make sure to take breaks.\n\nDiet - Some foods are going to give you better motivation than other foods. Things that are high in sugar content (processed food, candy, fast food, etc.) are going to zap your motivation very easily. If your family typically hands you food and you eat it, ask them to buy you more fruits. Fruits are great to making you feel better, and if you feel better you'll likely be more motivated to do the work. I changed my diet during college, and I just felt great by cutting out sugar. I went full vegetarian and I feel so much different now than I did when I was a teen. You'd be surprised how much sugar you're likely consuming, and sugar zaps your motivation in a harsh way.\n\nI wish you luck, and encourage you to continue to ask for more advice if these kinds of things don't manage to help you.", "id": "dammusm"}], [{"comment": "Plan out you day.

I was recommended to a social worker at my high school because of the sudden lack of effort that I could not give good reason for. I was lucky to have ended up getting to the university I wanted despite almost failing a class that year. Now that I'm better, I study (my job requires continual knowledge improvement) like a champ and am actually better than many of my peers who were always \"A\" students. \n\nA lot of the posts above mention going to a coffee shop and just sitting there and getting work done. This is a popular strategy for the aforementioned \"A\" students who didn't have the motivation issues we have had. The social worker I had a few sessions with also had the \"small victories - small rewards\" challenge as her premier solution to my problem. None of this got me going. It's a depressing cycle too. Set goals for small victories then repeatedly fail them.\n\nObviously, part of getting better was just growing out of it. (Being a teenager sucks in many ways to include hormonally despite your intelligence). However, what I also did was find some sort of thing that would finally motivate me to perform to what I perceive is the standard I should have. \n\nWhat worked for me was studying and working hard enough so that I could effectively participate in group study. Have you tried getting together with a two or three classmates and setting up group study to hold you accountable? Remember, don't go to big with the group or it will turn into a hangout sesh. Building from that, I started to work hard enough so that I could help other people that were struggling. Is there anyone else in your classes feeling similarly? Maybe your goal can be to help them? Don't do one on one studying with them if you're not ready though, you might just not study and be distracted by talking about your similar situation. Maybe include them in the first group. Finally, I was able to transition to studying for me, to keep up the same standard that I set with previous methods. \n\nYour motivators do not have to be these; find what works for you. The goal is to start working hard because you deserve. Never rely on doing it for someone else because as soon as that person fails you, you have a reason to quit. You never have a reason to quit on yourself. You only get this time of free education with plenty of time to seek your own hobbies once. I hope you have the opportunity to take full advantage of it.\n\nGood luck!

[This page](http://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php) is one of the best pages on the internet for making a grocery list and getting information about food and your diet- It's a list of cheap, ubiquitously available, healthy foods with detailed data and summarised clinical studies, and varying a selection from here will keep 95% of your nutrition in check.\n\n2. Find the right time to shop, usually an hour or two after work is out in the towns and cities- This is when supermarkets label/sticker products which are going out of date at marked down prices and you can find your regular grocery list items at as little as 10% of their regular price.\n\n3. Meal Prep should be a part of most peoples lives because it's very flexible, very cheap, very healthy and can save you a ton of time, effort and money. /r/EatCheapAndHealthy/ and /r/MealPrep are fantastic for getting started but if you have a crockpot,  tortillas/wraps or any form of plastic/Tupperware container then you already have enough to get started. I make weeks worths of varied lunches in the form of tortilla wraps and select and take one out the night before and I'll make up to a months worth of different frozen ready-meals for any time I might be too busy to cook dinner.\n\n4. Overnight oats/muesli are wonderful and take 30 seconds to make.\n\n5. A good habit is to buy a month or mores worth of meat, grains and other pantry items, then freezing/stocking them- this way all you need to buy throughout the month is fruit and veg, maybe milk and eggs. Combine this with well timed online shopping and you can reduce your grocery trips to as little as once or twice a month for things like leafy greens.\n\n6.

Chicken stock, shredded chicken, ro-tel, cumin & other mixi-spices, and put any leftover beans and rice in the soup to thicken it up. Top with avocado slices and cilantro/onion.\nWednesday - leftover soup for lunch, Shrimp Tacos for dinner. Shrimp sauteed in Old Bay, served in Tortillas with Black Beans, Spanish Rice, Crema, Avocado, Cilantro/Onion. \nThursday - there are never any shrimp tacos left for lunch! Chicken Burritos for dinner. Chicken burritos are also known as \"clean out the fridge\" burritos - the week's leftover black beans and rice mixed with the rest of the shredded chicken, topped with the leftover crema, avocados, cilantro, and onion.\nFriday & Saturday - frankenmeals or eat out!\n\nBonus: I've gotten quite familiar with my rice cooker over the last year. It is so easy to make various yummy rice dishes that aren't just plain white/brown rice.

Here is the criteria i usually use when picking my recipes.\n\n1. Time- I have less than an hour to cook every night except Saturday & Sunday, so I look for cooking times (including prep) on the recipe. If it requires too much time, its out. I purposely pick things that take longer on the weekend because I enjoy cooking and making things completely from scratch. \n\n2. My husband loves meat, so I make sure that most of my recipes have meat. I might make one vegetarian meal a week and it's usually a healthy pasta. \n\n3. I pick things that have cheap ingredients unless I have a little extra money that week to budget for food. Big cuts of meat are expensive, so I limit recipes with those. I usually pick a chicken recipes, pork, and sausage since all of those are more affordable. If i am going to choose a meal that requires a more expensive ingredient, I will pick another recipe that uses that same ingredient so that it doesn't go to waste. \nCheese is a good example of this. I don't want to pay for fresh feta or blue cheese that I wont use and will go to waste. If I buy blue cheese, usually two of my recipes will use it. I might have a grilled chicken salad topped with blue cheese one night and then a buffalo chicken wrap a couple nights later. \n\n4. I personally look for a good mix of health conscious meals and comfort food. I was on a keto diet a few years ago and found a few really great paleo meals that i still make. As long as the majority of my meals aren't completely terrible for me, I'm happy. I like to throw in a comfort food Sunday like Chicken pot pie or lasagna!

[This page](http://www.whfoods.com/foodstoc.php) is one of the best pages on the internet for making a grocery list and getting information about food and your diet- It's a list of cheap, ubiquitously available, healthy foods with detailed data and summarised clinical studies, and varying a selection from here will keep 95% of your nutrition in check.\n\n2. Find the right time to shop, usually an hour or two after work is out in the towns and cities- This is when supermarkets label/sticker products which are going out of date at marked down prices and you can find your regular grocery list items at as little as 10% of their regular price.\n\n3. Meal Prep should be a part of most peoples lives because it's very flexible, very cheap, very healthy and can save you a ton of time, effort and money. /r/EatCheapAndHealthy/ and /r/MealPrep are fantastic for getting started but if you have a crockpot,  tortillas/wraps or any form of plastic/Tupperware container then you already have enough to get started. I make weeks worths of varied lunches in the form of tortilla wraps and select and take one out the night before and I'll make up to a months worth of different frozen ready-meals for any time I might be too busy to cook dinner.\n\n4. Overnight oats/muesli are wonderful and take 30 seconds to make.\n\n5. A good habit is to buy a month or mores worth of meat, grains and other pantry items, then freezing/stocking them- this way all you need to buy throughout the month is fruit and veg, maybe milk and eggs. Combine this with well timed online shopping and you can reduce your grocery trips to as little as once or twice a month for things like leafy greens.\n\n6.

I also make a yummy cilantro-jalapeno-lime-sour cream \"crema\" that I store in a mason jar and use as a topper for multiple meals.  \nMonday - leftover enchiladas for lunch, Shrimp Pasta for dinner, which is half a bag of frozen shrimp sauteed in Old Bay, throw in some cherry tomatoes and any other veggies in the fridge, served over angel hair and topped with parmesan.\nTuesday - leftover pasta for lunch, Mexican Chicken Soup for dinner. Chicken stock, shredded chicken, ro-tel, cumin & other mixi-spices, and put any leftover beans and rice in the soup to thicken it up. Top with avocado slices and cilantro/onion.\nWednesday - leftover soup for lunch, Shrimp Tacos for dinner. Shrimp sauteed in Old Bay, served in Tortillas with Black Beans, Spanish Rice, Crema, Avocado, Cilantro/Onion. \nThursday - there are never any shrimp tacos left for lunch! Chicken Burritos for dinner. Chicken burritos are also known as \"clean out the fridge\" burritos - the week's leftover black beans and rice mixed with the rest of the shredded chicken, topped with the leftover crema, avocados, cilantro, and onion.\nFriday & Saturday - frankenmeals or eat out!\n\nBonus: I've gotten quite familiar with my rice cooker over the last year. It is so easy to make various yummy rice dishes that aren't just plain white/brown rice. My Spanish Rice, for example, is 1 cup white rice, 1 cup chicken broth, 1 can of ro-tel, and a generous spoonful of minced garlic. Throw a tbsp of butter in when it has 5 min left. Perfect!", "id": "dao3uof"}], [{"comment": "There are also a lot of really easy meals for those night you don't want to cook. \n\nAnd I bulk cook - sorta.  If I am making spaghetti - I make 4 times as much as I need, bag and freeze three portions and the then next 3 times I make spaghetti - I just take the precooked meat sauce out, boil noodles and I'm done.  \n\nIf I am making chicken and dumplings, I make 4 times the chicken in broth.  Take out three portions and freeze it.  Now I can make chicken n dumplings in just the time it takes to cook the dumplings.  \n\nI also started throwing out a lot less produce when I started buying to from a market that is straight from the farm.  It never goes to a warehouse, so instead of lasting 1-3 days after buying in grocery store, it last about a week. \n\nIf I am grilling up chicken, I grill extra, cut it up and store it in frig.  I can easily throw it in salad, chop it up and make chicken salad, and in a pinch throw it in a pan with some House of Tsang spicy sauce, throw in a bag of Birds Eye steam in bag veggies and I have a stir fry.  Add rice for the hubby. \n\nThere are lots of easy and tasty weeknight meals and ways to make it easier.  Planning it key! \n", "id": "daodeot"}], [{"comment": "Thank you.
