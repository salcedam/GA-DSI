All the ice would sink to the bottom of the lake as it starts forming and eventually if it stays cold enough, long enough you'll be left with a solid ice everywhere.

If you don't mind me copypasting from a comment I wrote a couple of days ago, here's my rough guide to seeing and capturing the milky way for a photo (or timelapse)  like this - \n\n\n\n 1. Check your moon forecasts. I can't link to anything because I'm on mobile, but there are various sites that'll tell you when the moon is due to set, and its phase. You want a well set new moon ideally. There should be one of them tomorrow night. \n\n 2. Check the weather forecasts. You want dry, cloudless conditions. Wind is okay, but you'll want shelter to keep your tripod solid. \n\n 3. Find where the milky way is going to be. Stellarium (Google for it) is terrific for this - it models where the planet is due to be pointing at any given time, so you'll know exactly where to look and when. It isn't always available to be seen. \n\n 4. Get to high ground. My favourite spot is on top of a hill. Avoid basins - they collect low level mist like nothing else. \n\n 5. Set up the camera. I use a d5500 with a sigma 18-35mm 1.8. You'll generally want a wide angle shot with an exposure of around 10 seconds. The wider the angle, the longer you can keep the sensor exposed without star trails. I think that was shot at 13s 1600 iso 1.8f and 18mm.\n\n 6. Use camera raw in Photoshop to bring out the colours and the definition. I can send you my raw and xml files if you're curious to see how that might work for yourself. \n\nIt's difficult, but it's an amazing feeling when it comes together. \n\n---\n\nEdit: I've got about a dozen messages & PMs asking for the RAW files. I'll reply to each of you when I get home to my computer, and put a link up here for everyone else who might want to tinker with them.", "id": "daozhdw"}, {"comment": "0 - First [find a place](http://darksitefinder.com/maps/world.html) where it's dark!

The amount of hyperbolic nonsense I see about these guns because they're cheap is incredible, which doesn't surprise me seeing as this is a community where it's normal to spend $10,000+ on what mostly ends up being toys.\n\nYou can find these guns for like $150 new and they come in .380, 9mm, .40S&W, and .45 ACP. At that price you'd be damn lucky to find a good deal on a nicer use gun or a surplus 9x18 handgun. Even those surplus makarovs are iffy due to the unreliable ammo supply since makarovs and their clones are pretty much the only guns in the US that use that cartridge and the cartridge itself isn't even as good as the 9mm Luger for self defense.\n\nThey're good if you're poor or want a gun to throw in your car or something. There are far worse pistols you can buy, and I'm not even kidding when I say I trust it over certain more expensive guns (Taurus specifically, their quality control is a nightmare). If you have problems with them the company has a lifetime warranty on them (lifetime of the gun, not the owner) where they will fix the gun for free and send a free magazine to cover any shipping costs, which would be a pretty stupid business decision if they were garbage that had tons of problems.\n\nThe main reason people hate them seems to come from the Zamak-3 slide, which has been shown to not be as shitty as you'd think judging from the other zinc-o-matics out there (insert link to Iraqveteran8888 torture test you've probably seen before).\n\nI feel like every time these come up you have to remind people that not everyone has so much expendable income that they can drop hundreds of dollars on yet another new range toy. Don't get me wrong, if you can afford something better then don't get the Hi-Point just to save money. Some people  can't afford it though, and poor people have a right to self defense or recreational shooting as much as anyone else. Sorry if that doesn't make them a respectable gun owner in your eyes!\n\nFor the record, this isn't buyer's remorse or my lack of cash talking. I have a Cobra Derringer (unusable trigger makes it worthless) and a Ruger LCP (way too many complaints about the takedown pin suddenly walking out) and wouldn't defend them, nor do I even really like the Hi-Point that much given that it's more utilitarian than a Glock in it's role as a firearm, but I feel like I have to defend it against the tsunami of hyperbole you see said about it.", "id": "dapq378"}, {"comment": "I would not trust one to fire every time on the first try though. hi-points are good range toys, since it doesn't matter if you jam on the range and you just want to go shoot cheap ammo all afternoon. but any kind of weapon that I might have to use as.. well... a WEAPON, I'd prefer something with better build quality and tested reliability. for $300-$600, you can get basically the best, most reliable handguns money can buy, and if you're going to carry if for defense/killing such as this drug dealer claims to be doing, then it's worth spending an afternoon of drug sales on it.

Less so in NASCAR, but Indie cars have had this feature for ages.  \n\nThe reason the driver stayed alive is probably due to the seat and the HANS (Head And Neck Safety) device. It pretty much completely restrains the driver's head and neck to the fully upright position at all times.  \n\nIIRC the HANS device was implemented shortly after Dale Earnhardt Sr. opted not to use it before it was mandated, preferring his son take it, and died in a crash.

I think he might be trying to do that here, trying to get Ben to lean forward so he can get a hit and then finish the submission, but that may just be an excuse for bad behavior", "id": "daogrmu"}, {"comment": "Oh yeah, the Diaz brothers are famous for that. McGregor is great at it, Chael Sonnen, Bisping is quite brash too. More often than not, if you're fighting someone at a high level they won't fall for the bullshit in the octagon (check out their fights), it's before the fight that you really mess with them. Alvarez got it bad, as did Aldo, and Diaz and McGregor really fucked with each other a lot before their fights. My opinion though. You are entirely correct though, that's their intent and that is what they're tryna do. I just don't like how Diaz goes about it. Instead of taunting him he just comes across as huffy and childish. ", "id": "daoh84h"}, {"comment": "Nate just does it cause it works. Everyone who talks about him and Nick outside the cage almost always say they're just chill guys who like to smoke weed, run, bike, teach BJJ, etc. The taunting, trash-talking, etc. has been effective for them with even higher level guys. Michael Johnson admitted that all the talking got in his head and caused him to fight a completely different fight than he wanted to. Cerrone's said similar things about their fight. The verbal taunting and slaps even seemed to have a draining effect on Conor their first fight. I think it's less immaturity and more they've just figured out a tool that works to give them the upper hand in some occasions.", "id": "daowkmx"}, {"comment": "I agree with what you're saying, but look at their records. Nate is barely scratching a positive win-lose, and I'm not sure about Nick. I wouldn't even say it works most of the time. There had to be some skill to being a dickhead to make it work. I'll use McGregor because he's one of the most famous examples right now. McGregor varies his taunting up with verbal abuse, physical taunts, even playing to the crowd. Nate relies on 'motherfucker' and the middle finger. Beyond him not being that great of a mixed martial artist, he's not very good at engaging his opponents either. It's annoying more than effective. \n\nAgain, all of this is in my own opinion. ", "id": "dapombb"}, {"comment": "Look at Nate's last three fights. He made Michael Johnson, a top fiver, look like an amateur for an entire fight. He fought Conor, a now two division champion twice, submitting him once, and fighting a close fight that went the distance the second time. \n\nGuys that fought them will themselves admit that their taunting and trash talk has a huge effect. Condit says he had a guy literally mimic that behavior in training in order to prepare for Nick. Saying that what they do isn't effective doesn't really make sense, as they guys they fight will often admit the opposite.\n\nTo say that either of the Diaz brother's aren't that great of mixed martial artistic doesn't really make sense either as their boxing and BJJ is regarded as some of the the highest level in the sport. They do have their weaknesses, namely their vulnerability to leg kicks, but they are very well rounded, top level fighters no doubt. ", "id": "daqbhqq"}, {"comment": "Surely their outstanding constitution plays more of a part than most others? His BJJ is phenomenal, I will never argue that. His striking is adequate enough that he can use it, but isn't one of his best weapons his ability to just absorb hits? You keep tryna land that KO blow and exerting that effort, whole Diaz is swallowing these punches and waiting for you to fuck up. While maybe I can allow that their trash talking may seem effective, I honestly don't think it has any severe impact on the opponents performance. Holm didn't give in to Rousey's antics and won. If Condit did prepare that way (not saying you're wrong, just that I hadn't heard that before, which would be a cool fact) then one could argue that it was simply to prepare against all eventualities. Diaz would talk shit and Condit didn't want to be bothered by it. That's not a recognition of Diaz's otherworldly skills as a trash talker, just the fact that he is a trash talker. \n\nWhat I meant (in part) about Nate not being very good was his record. 19-18 I think it was. That's the kind of record that keeps the commissioners eye on you. It's not bad (because it is positive) but it's not close to being good. \n\nGreat points though.

Yes, there was emotional trauma,  but there was also some spinal injury, so who knows - chicken or the egg. The diagnosis was demonstrated by the hammer & knee test in which a Dr. hammers your knee in that special place that triggers your Sympathetic & Para-Sympathetic response; reaction and recovery. Apparently,  I only kick-out but don't equally pull back as one is expected to during that test. This, coupled with a constricted brain stem that creates chronic headaches. The only upside to this is lightning fast reflexes... a perpetual state of \"hyper vigilance\". However the downside side is decreased sensitivity in the penis department, which totally sucks. Curiously, I've often joked that I'm Schizo because when I'm dog tired and want to go to sleep my brain roars with conversations and fantasies and takes me a long time to go to sleep.  I often wake up with conversations/arguments running in my head,  to the point that I even spit out a few words. I hate it.\n\nB: Pot doesn't help. Discovering pot late in life, somewhat because of the above mentioned structure of myself, it initially seemed to help, bringing me more into the present moment, etc.  However, after about five years of use, I'm pretty sure it added to the Schizophrenic effect since being high, imo, basically makes you dream while you're awake, i.e. amplifies your subconcious. \n\nAnyhow,  I could go on,  but very curious insight there. ... \n", "id": "darddts"}], [{"comment": "Pretty sure that's just magic.", "id": "daq2taz"}, {"comment": "[An interactive kinetic sculpture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fukK3MGAZo)", "id": "daqaldd"}], [{"comment": "Q*bert", "id": "daq7660"}], [{"comment": "i need it", "id": "daq32so"}], [{"comment": "If you want to print your own, check it out on [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6513)!", "id": "daq36zw"}], [{"comment": "2D screen displaying a 3D optical illusion.", "id": "daqal5q"}, {"comment": "You would think this would \"ruin the magic\", but actually depth perception makes these kinds of illusions much less impressive.

The three steps are:\n\n* Precisely aligning two metal blades with two equally sized slots, then inserting the blades into the slots\n* Precisely aligning a rectangular plug with a rectangular slot, and pushing the plug into the slot. Note that the plug only fits into the slot one way, and able-bodies people are only successful at this step on the first try around 50% of the time.\n* Precisely aligning a small female charging adapter over a male fitting on the spoon's handle\n\n\nI've got zero experience with folks requiring this type of device, so maybe I'm not getting the full picture. I realize a lot of people who would use this are dependent on another person at least part time - so that other person could charge it - but would a person living independently really not get pissed at this thing, trying to complete the above three steps while fighting tremors or other instability?
