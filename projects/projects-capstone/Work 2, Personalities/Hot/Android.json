What's more, since most of the code that comprises CM is crowdsourced, actual core development costs would have (theoretically) been lower.

The charging is fast and I noticed that the QC 2.0 charger on my car actually charges the phone pretty fast too. \n\nIt just shows that specs on paper dont mean shit when the phone starts lagging like crazy after doing anything processor intensive. This phone is really well optimized for the processor and everything just works. These flagships have all sorts of high end specs on paper but when it comes to real world usage, they suck.

It was unique for its software and display ratio. Then there was the MX4 Pro, which had an efficient Exynos 5430 chip, QHD screen and a fingerprint scanner. That was a neat phone. M1 Note was also cool - lots for a low price. 2015 was pretty consistent and great as well. MX5 and Pro 5 (my absolute favourite) were awesome.

When I factory resetted and upgraded to the Nougat previews, Amazon's DRM started glitching so I bought it again from the Play Store. \n\nShuttle+ is my main music player and only one of two apps that I know of that read MP3 tags directly from the file, with the other being Poweramp. I've bought both but use Shuttle because it's more better looking and user friendly. I've tried many other music player apps but they all could not read the tags from the MP3 files. The fact that Shuttle was able to read MP3 files alone was more than enough reason for me to buy it again from the Play Store. The Chromecast support, tag editing and theming were just an added bonus.\n\nThis is the first time I've heard about this Android MediaStore database. I was just wondering if this may be linked to all the problems I'm having with locally stored music on Android. [The problems I'm having are elaborated here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus/comments/5bm7w6/when_i_copy_some_music_in_my_nexus_it_comes_up/d9qr8mu/) Could they be related possibly?", "id": "daihs5h"}, {"comment": "Definitely sounds like a MediaStore issue to me.

Also, the song lengths were displayed correctly, as opposed to some having 0:00.

Thats my point I not saying the display is any better or worse really. They both have their disadvantages, IPS obviously has less contrast ratio, which is unfortunate but AMOLED has plenty of other drawbacks. They are both high quality displays. The small pixel maybe less so but still. The 10 and pixel have the same CPU and GPU, there's no difference in performance. The 10 also has very high quality nand as does the pixel.

Apps are ranked in levels of importance, since we may want to silence a promotional notification, but not an alert from your bank.\n- Decide which time is most suitable to clean unnecessary system files for you.\n- Learn when to turn the phone into a lower/higher performance mode.

Podcasts mostly, but also music. And it's a big deal to me to not have to use an AUX cable. \n\nHaven't had any issues with this from the phone end for years...until today with the Pixel. With the Pixel, the Bluetooth connection to my car would drop randomly, forcing me to turn off and on again the BT on the phone. Then MAYBE it would work again.\n\n**This is a known issue on Pixels on 7.1 and may be fixed in 7.1.1, but something so basic today as playing BT  audio in a car with this functionality shouldn't have any issues, especially in Google's flagship Pixel phone released in 2016.**\n\nMy overall point is, I don't care what the Pixel does better or what the V20 does better. **But when the Pixel out of the box has issues with something so basic as BT audio in a car, THAT is something that leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

When I play music from Google Now directly from the phone, it understands \"download only\" and plays what is on the device. Android auto instead turns off Download Only and starts streaming the wrong album. If you follow Android auto's guidelines, you need to unplug the phone to change it back to download only. This could be summed up as \"voice controls for music fucking suck.\"\n\nTalk back - When Android auto it reitterates fucking everything you say. \"Play some music\" - \"Okay, playing some music\" // \"Navigate to 1400 Penn avenue, washington DC.\" -- \"Okay, navigating to 1-4-0-0 pennsylvania avenue in washington dc\". This is great for texts, and to a lesser extend navigation, but this is terrible for when you tell it to play next song.\n\nMaps - Works great, but it also stores data and doesn't really give a great way to purge previous locations.

It's pretty good, but I always  look at it and feel like it should be better.\n\nNav works great 90% of the time.  Traveling up into the mountains  I frequently lose a data connection and that can, at times, cause the program to lock up when it tries to catch up.  It has rerouted me several times to avoid traffic and has saved me countless hours, but does so inconsistently (it has rerouted me off of a main route back to civilization after skiing a couple times but has routinely failed to do so even in similar traffic).  It displays construction and accidents from what I assume is Waze.  Voice search on nav is about 50/50.  I frequently get \"If you just said something, I didn't quite hear it\".  It's because it locks up after giving me the audible ding indicating it's listening.  But I don't know that.\n\nSpotify works well, as does audible.  Tune In has issues with volume control after the nav speaks.  If I'm listening to Tune In at 10 and the nav mutes it to 2 when it speaks, Tune In only comes back on at about a 6.  If I turn the audio volume up to get it back at 10, the next time the nav talks it's screaming at me.  I have to pause/play Tune In again to get the appropriate levels.\n\nI wish the texting was more fluid/intuitive.

When I play music from Google Now directly from the phone, it understands \"download only\" and plays what is on the device. Android auto instead turns off Download Only and starts streaming the wrong album. If you follow Android auto's guidelines, you need to unplug the phone to change it back to download only. This could be summed up as \"voice controls for music fucking suck.\"\n\nTalk back - When Android auto it reitterates fucking everything you say. \"Play some music\" - \"Okay, playing some music\" // \"Navigate to 1400 Penn avenue, washington DC.\" -- \"Okay, navigating to 1-4-0-0 pennsylvania avenue in washington dc\". This is great for texts, and to a lesser extend navigation, but this is terrible for when you tell it to play next song.\n\nMaps - Works great, but it also stores data and doesn't really give a great way to purge previous locations.

It's pretty good, but I always  look at it and feel like it should be better.\n\nNav works great 90% of the time.  Traveling up into the mountains  I frequently lose a data connection and that can, at times, cause the program to lock up when it tries to catch up.  It has rerouted me several times to avoid traffic and has saved me countless hours, but does so inconsistently (it has rerouted me off of a main route back to civilization after skiing a couple times but has routinely failed to do so even in similar traffic).  It displays construction and accidents from what I assume is Waze.  Voice search on nav is about 50/50.  I frequently get \"If you just said something, I didn't quite hear it\".  It's because it locks up after giving me the audible ding indicating it's listening.  But I don't know that.\n\nSpotify works well, as does audible.  Tune In has issues with volume control after the nav speaks.  If I'm listening to Tune In at 10 and the nav mutes it to 2 when it speaks, Tune In only comes back on at about a 6.  If I turn the audio volume up to get it back at 10, the next time the nav talks it's screaming at me.  I have to pause/play Tune In again to get the appropriate levels.\n\nI wish the texting was more fluid/intuitive.

One is the ability to run routines (or whatever they're calling them now). I'm actually amazed this is missing from Home out of the box. At bedtime I say 'Alexa start bedtime,' and it shuts down all the lights and sets the alarm.\n\nThe other advantage is being able to group lights into multiple rooms.

I have had an Echo since launch and a Google Home for about 3 weeks.\n\nThere is a night and day difference between the two.   I can gives tons of examples in the last three weeks where the Echo failed me and the Google Home saved the day.\n\nBut just one this last Saturday my son comes to me last minute and indicates his game is away not home like he told me.\n\nSay \"hey google how long to get to X\" where X was the high school.   Google Home returns with the time, traffic and that there were detorres.   Apparently an area morning run event.\n\nThe Echo did not even know the high school.  It is the same with inference with music.    So with Google Home you could say \"hey google play sting gwen bottle\" and Gwen and Sting singing message in the bottle will start.   I have had to do a quick Google search in the past to get the name of a song to then get the Echo to play.   I am terrible at remembering song names.   \n\nBut the biggest difference is song catalog.   YouTube is HUGE.   Take Mummers Dance.   There is over 20 versions on YouTube.   Orchestra, instrumental, live, studio, etc.    Can not even get the Echo to play the song let alone chose a version.\n\nBut the last killer feature is how the Google Home works with you TV.   It will turn it on, select the proper input, and start playing.    Echo can NOT do this.\n\nBoth Amazon and Google will add.   But Amazon has to rework the foundation of their device (fundamental) to use inference instead of something close to commands.    Where Google needs to add some native interfaces on top.   But those interface are already available using IFTTT in most cases.\n\nWhat I struggle with there are people that suggest the two are equal or close.

The other stuff - being able to ask for answers to questions and stuff like that - is just gravy. Unfortunately it can't replace Sonos and doesn't integrate ST very well.

Since Echo doesn't support GPM I resorted to using Spotify as my default music source. If I'm listening to Spotify at work and my roommate goes to start music at home using the Echo my music dies. Since he usually started playing music when he got home and cooked himself dinner this would mean that my music died almost every day if he got home before I did.\n\nCurrent setup is a Google Home in every room with some rooms having nice speakers connected to Chromecasts. Now if I'm listening to GPM at work and my roommate goes to start music using the Google Home I get 0 interruption. The Chromecasts are only for if I'll be in an area for an extended period of (usually cooking or cleaning). Otherwise the home device itself is perfectly fine for listening to short term. I can also be in my room getting ready and listening to music while he's listening to something else in the living room.\n\nVoice control is also huge for me. The apartment I'm renting has almost no lighting so we've got lamps setup everywhere that we control with the echo / home. Music voice control is also pretty great since it means whoever is over can control the music. Prior to getting an Echo music was either done by me through chromecast (pre-chromecast audio so I had to turn on the TV and cast it, not a huge deal but still an extra step + waiting time) or my roommate would just blast it through his phone on full volume (drove me nuts).

Majority of the Echo home integration can be done with IFTTT and Google will add.\n\n\nBut much harder to fix how the device fundamentally works.    I posted this elsewhere but thought it fit.\n\n\nWe have had the Echo since launch and the Google Home for about 3 weeks.    We had always loved the Echo.   But the Google Home is in a league of its own.   Take just playing music the catalog of songs and huge with the Google Home as it has YouTube in addition to Google Play or Spotify or whatever.\n\n\n\nBut it is the inference aspect that is night and day different.   With the Echo I would sometimes have to do a quick Google search to get a song title from a short lyric or something.   That step is not required with the Google Home as you can just get close.   So say \"hey google play gwen sting bottle\" and Message in a bottle plays.   The Echo just can not do things like this.\n\n\nIt is also the entire concept is different.    With Google you say \"will I need a coat tonight\" and it answers.    With the Echo you ask something about the weather tonight and a location.   Then you figure out if you need a coat.   Somehow the Google Home just knows your location.   The Echo you need to include or set it.\n\n\nBut it is the ability of the Google Home to turn on the TV, set the input, and play a video that wins the day for us.   So my wife said last night \"hey google play saturday night highlights on TV\" and the TV turns itself on, input set, and the video plays.   Did not lift a hand and definitely did NOT need to search for the remote.    We did name our Nvidia Shield TV.  I am buying a bunch more Google Homes so will rename it something like \"master\".    So will say something like \"play sting gwen bottle on master\".     Then kids TVs will be named their name or something similar.\n\nIf confused on what to buy watch some of the YouTube videos to really see the difference.

Most major companies have developed skills for it so you don't need to use IFTTT. HomeSeer, LIFX, SmartThings, Nexia, Ecobee are some of the ones off the top of my head.

Add an internet connectivity permission. \n\n* Lock apps individually: Allow locking specific apps and require a passcode/fingerprint/etc to open app.\n\n* Hide apps: Allow hiding apps from the app drawer and/or app switcher.\n\n* Multi-user functionality: Allow specific users to log in by using their password/fingerprint.\n\n\n\n**Look and Feel:**\n\n* Dark theme: Create dark-themed UI elements.  Allow devs to choose if they use it, but give users control to override if the app uses standard UI elements.\n\n* Continuum-esque functionality: Plug into a dock/peripherals for a desktop UI.  Assign long-press actions to right click.  Allow using phone while docked or using it as a trackpad if no mouse is connected.  \n\n* Reversible navigation buttons: Insert it into AOSP so OEMs are more likely to allow you to switch the order of buttons.\n\n* Adjustable quick toggle grid: Allow users to change the number of rows/columns of quick toggles.\n \n* Open quick toggles when no notifications are present:  Many custom ROMs have this nifty little option.\n\n* More information-dense material design:  Google should find a way to keep Material Design beautiful while displaying more information.\n\n\n\n**Default Apps:**\n\n* Modularize the system UI:  Split the system UI into APKs for lockscreen, statusbar, navigation bar, notification drawer/quick toggles, recents, etc.  Allow users/OEMs to download third party versions and pick a default.  This would also allow updates to major components to come from the Play Store, independent of OEMs.\n\n* Make a calendar default:  This will allow the Android system to interact with your schedule.\n\n\n**Voice:**\n\n* Custom hotword:  Allow the user to create a global, custom hotword to initiate a voice search.  Allow it to work with any assistant app.\n\n\n\n\n**Settings Menu:**\n\n* Global per-app settings:  Sorta how iOS does it, but linked within the same menu used to force kill, clear data, and uninstall apps.  Allows adjusting app settings from outside the app.\n\n* Settings profiles:  Allow creating a profile of settings that you can switch to manually or contextually.\n\n* Extensible AOSP settings:  Allow OEMs to insert settings under certain menus, create new menus, or alter existing settings  This help prevent OEMs from creating entirely new settings apps.\n\n\n\n\n**Google Apps:**\n\n* **Google Search:** Add a search box to the Assistant popup: Allows searching via text from anywhere.  Add search filters (date, etc) to app. Mobile web search has this.\n* **Google Calendar:**  Allow calendar events to initiate device actions.  \n* **Google Drive:** Allow linking Google Drive folders to device folders. (Or at least put a link to folders) in the device storage.\n* **Google Camera:** Add live photo functionality.  Allow other apps to take panoramas and photospheres. Push everything to AOSP.\n* **Google Photos:** Make photo picker list all device folders first while still showing cloud photos.\n* **Google Dialer:** Show more information about unknown numbers.  Push all non-Google functions to AOSP.\n* **Google Messenger:** Add ability to initiate contact on other platforms (like a Duo video call).  Allow scheduled messages.  Encrypt messages and backup to cloud.  Push everything to AOSP.\n* **Google Contacts:**  Add fields for social media profiles, let apps automatically populate them.  Associate custom ringtones, notification sounds, vibration patterns, and notification lights to contacts.\n* **Google Play Store:** Add categories for tablet apps, Android Wear apps, Daydream apps, Cast-enabled apps, and widgets.  Split games away from apps.\n* **Google Play Music:** Increase information density.  Stop stretching album art.  Allow users to change default sorting.  Allow hiding (un)censored versions of songs in library.  Allow uploading music from phone. Allow tag editing.  Allow importing/exporting/sharing playlists.

Add an AMOLED/night mode.\n* **Google Play Games:** Make user profiles more customizable, suggest friends, and compare game stats to friends.\n* **Google Keep:**  Allow nested bullet lists.  Allow mixed content.  Add more note background colors.  Attach multiple (recurring) reminders to notes.  Allow embedding a spreadsheet from Google Sheets in Keep.  Add handwriting recognition.  Allow importing/exporting.\n* **YouTube:** Make more information dense. Allow re-ordering of queue.  Allow browsing by topic/genre.

A lot of the things I want to see are either more customization and control, more APIs for devs to tap into, or framework changes so each OEM doesn't implement stuff differently, and so that Android is easier to update.\n\n**Notifications:**\n\n* Notification syncing: Allow viewing notifications on Chrome (or Windows, MacOS, & Linux if Google wants to play nice)\n\n* Fine-tuned notification controls:  Choose notification tone(s) for app, choose if allowed to vibrate, choose if allowed to wake the screen, choose notification light color, choose if notifications are shown on lockscreen, choose between no popup, ticker, or heads-up notifications for app, choose if notifications are forwarded to Chrome, (in developer settings) allow blocking certain notifications, but not all, from a specific app.\n\n* More UI elements in notifications: Allow devs to put UI elements like toggles, sliders, and multiline textboxes in notifications.\n\n* Stop reordering notifications when notification drawer is active: Goddamn it, please Google, just fix this!  I'm tired of clicking the wrong notification because you adjust the order right under my fingers.\n\n* Fix quick replies:  Currently, when clicking on a notification (whether accidental or intentional) any text inputted via quick reply is lost.  It would be nice if that carried over to the app.\n\n* Sync Do Not Disturb with calendar:  Give users the ability to enter Do Not Disturb mode automatically when an event is scheduled.\n\n\n\n**Hardware support:**\n\n* Force Touch: Add peek and pop, link launcher shortcuts to it, give it some unique features too\n\n* Hover gestures support: Just add it so every OEM doesn't do their own thing with it.\n\n* Iris scanner support: Do it so every OEM doesn't implement it differently.\n\n* Screen-off gestures support: Allow defining swipe and shake gestures to perform actions when the screen is off (for hardware that supports it).  Add some of Moto's actions.\n\n\n\n\n**Home Screen:**\n\n* Google Now/Assistant Launcher APIs: Allow third party launchers to integrate a Google Now page.\n\n* Notification count badges: Allow apps to show how many new messages, emails, notifications, etc. on the launcher icon.\n\n* Dynamic launcher icons: Allow calendar apps to adjust for the date, weather apps can show the weather, etc.\n\n* Allow animated GIFs as a wallpaper\n\n\n\n\n\n**Cloud:**\n\n* Automatic cloud backups: enable it for all apps by default, but allow devs targeting the new APIs to opt out and users can disable on a per-app basis.\n\n* Backup all system settings to cloud\n\n* Allow sync dictionary to Chrome: Allow downloading custom dictionaries, sync with Chrome's dict.\n\n\n\n**Lockscreen:**\n\n* Allow viewing weather on the lockscreen.\n\n* More active display functionality: Allow active display to be triggered upon waving your hand over the device, picking the device up, or removing the device from your pocket.\n\n* Actual always-on display functionality: Allow the screen to display some stuff all the time...such as notification icons in the statusbar, weather, and time.\n\n\n\n**Security/Privacy:**\n\n* More refined permissions:  Add permissions for accessing third-party accounts.  Add descriptions for permissions so users know why an app is requesting permission.  Add an internet connectivity permission. \n\n* Lock apps individually: Allow locking specific apps and require a passcode/fingerprint/etc to open app.\n\n* Hide apps: Allow hiding apps from the app drawer and/or app switcher.\n\n* Multi-user functionality: Allow specific users to log in by using their password/fingerprint.\n\n\n\n**Look and Feel:**\n\n* Dark theme: Create dark-themed UI elements.  Allow devs to choose if they use it, but give users control to override if the app uses standard UI elements.\n\n* Continuum-esque functionality: Plug into a dock/peripherals for a desktop UI.  Assign long-press actions to right click.  Allow using phone while docked or using it as a trackpad if no mouse is connected.  \n\n* Reversible navigation buttons: Insert it into AOSP so OEMs are more likely to allow you to switch the order of buttons.\n\n* Adjustable quick toggle grid: Allow users to change the number of rows/columns of quick toggles.\n \n* Open quick toggles when no notifications are present:  Many custom ROMs have this nifty little option.\n\n* More information-dense material design:  Google should find a way to keep Material Design beautiful while displaying more information.\n\n\n\n**Default Apps:**\n\n* Modularize the system UI:  Split the system UI into APKs for lockscreen, statusbar, navigation bar, notification drawer/quick toggles, recents, etc.  Allow users/OEMs to download third party versions and pick a default.  This would also allow updates to major components to come from the Play Store, independent of OEMs.\n\n* Make a calendar default:  This will allow the Android system to interact with your schedule.\n\n\n**Voice:**\n\n* Custom hotword:  Allow the user to create a global, custom hotword to initiate a voice search.  Allow it to work with any assistant app.\n\n\n\n\n**Settings Menu:**\n\n* Global per-app settings:  Sorta how iOS does it, but linked within the same menu used to force kill, clear data, and uninstall apps.  Allows adjusting app settings from outside the app.\n\n* Settings profiles:  Allow creating a profile of settings that you can switch to manually or contextually.\n\n* Extensible AOSP settings:  Allow OEMs to insert settings under certain menus, create new menus, or alter existing settings  This help prevent OEMs from creating entirely new settings apps.\n\n\n\n\n**Google Apps:**\n\n* **Google Search:** Add a search box to the Assistant popup: Allows searching via text from anywhere.  Add search filters (date, etc) to app. Mobile web search has this.\n* **Google Calendar:**  Allow calendar events to initiate device actions.  \n* **Google Drive:** Allow linking Google Drive folders to device folders. (Or at least put a link to folders) in the device storage.\n* **Google Camera:** Add live photo functionality.  Allow other apps to take panoramas and photospheres. Push everything to AOSP.\n* **Google Photos:** Make photo picker list all device folders first while still showing cloud photos.\n* **Google Dialer:** Show more information about unknown numbers.  Push all non-Google functions to AOSP.\n* **Google Messenger:** Add ability to initiate contact on other platforms (like a Duo video call).  Allow scheduled messages.  Encrypt messages and backup to cloud.  Push everything to AOSP.\n* **Google Contacts:**  Add fields for social media profiles, let apps automatically populate them.  Associate custom ringtones, notification sounds, vibration patterns, and notification lights to contacts.\n* **Google Play Store:** Add categories for tablet apps, Android Wear apps, Daydream apps, Cast-enabled apps, and widgets.  Split games away from apps.\n* **Google Play Music:** Increase information density.  Stop stretching album art.  Allow users to change default sorting.  Allow hiding (un)censored versions of songs in library.  Allow uploading music from phone. Allow tag editing.  Allow importing/exporting/sharing playlists.  Allow watching the YouTube video in-app.  When casting, allow users to cast music videos for songs that have one.\n* **Google Play Newsstand:** Implement the same system on Google News's website for adding/limiting media outlets and topics.\n* **Google Play Books:**  Allow books to be read via text-to-speech.  Add an AMOLED/night mode.\n* **Google Play Games:** Make user profiles more customizable, suggest friends, and compare game stats to friends.\n* **Google Keep:**  Allow nested bullet lists.  Allow mixed content.  Add more note background colors.  Attach multiple (recurring) reminders to notes.  Allow embedding a spreadsheet from Google Sheets in Keep.  Add handwriting recognition.  Allow importing/exporting.\n* **YouTube:** Make more information dense. Allow re-ordering of queue.  Allow browsing by topic/genre.  Allow users to sort by date, length, etc.\n\n\n", "id": "dakxe6i"}], [{"comment": "A real gallery app.", "id": "dak76jq"}, {"comment": "I'm still sad that the AOSP gallery was abandoned.

If Apple or Android doesn't suddenly decide to change the way their accessories are designed, they often won't be compatible with each others. My guess is that it's yet another proprietary choice from Apple in order to sell more expensive \"certified by Apple\" headphones. That being said, inline remotes are often pretty bad on Android and have less buttons. But not having much controls is not that much of an issue if you can program additional actions like \"double click volume up for next track\" and so on.\n\nWhat is important to understand when it comes to remotes, is that it's your phone that is \"measuring\" a resistor in your headphone.

Which, again, Anandtech stopped including in their reviews because \"WALT's drag latency test seems to be highly unreliable and I'm kind of questionable on whether these results can really be trusted\".  \n\nIn HTC's own product unveil for the HTC 10, HTC reported that the HTC 10 has a touch response of 120ms - https://pics.computerbase.de/7/1/6/7/4/1-1080.53763535.jpg. This is far off from WALT's 54ms. Do you trust WALT or the manufacturer of the phone?  \n\nSecondly, WALT's tests specialize in reporting latency between taps and drags (scrolling). Check out their GitHub description - https://github.com/google/walt. WALT tests taps and drags, not how the phone responses to touch input. __There is a big difference between touch latency meaning simple scrolling and touch latency meaning perceived responsiveness and real-world usage of a phone.__   \n\nThirdly, let me reiterate what I said earlier. __Pixel's responsiveness comes from improvements in Android 7.1.__   \n\n\"The effective responsiveness is magnified by Android 7.1 due to its improvements to input latency. The way Google achieved this (as described to us by Chet Haase at the BABBQ 2016) is __by changing the order and priority of registering and rendering inputs and frames, which results in up to 40% reduced latency__...\" - https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-xl-xda-review-a-foundational-release-for-google-post-nexus-android/.  \n\nIf you read at the bottom of OP's post you would have also seen this: \"perhaps the optimizations (of the Pixel) are not in touch latency of the finger to the registration, but at the time of registration of the contact to the corresponding action by the operating system\".  \n\nTouch latency meaning real-world usage is what /u/Mehknic/ /u/heydabop/ /u/astrawnomore/ /u/BabysGotBends/ /u/johnnyboi1994 /u/yellowsn0wz/ /u/Randomd0g/ and I are referring to when we say the Pixel's is in a league of its own. No other device ships with 7.1. No other Android version has the operating system level responsiveness improvements from 7.1. Pixel's performance lead states \"we spent most of the time on performance consistency and touch latency. let's just say it paid off\" - https://twitter.com/t_murray/status/783349407827783681.  \n\nI have the Pixel and S7 Edge, which you and WALT claim have \"better latency\". Let me tell you, the S7 Edge is much slower. I've even taken slow-motion videos of the S7 Edge scrolling compared to the Pixel and three year old LG G2. It's not the most scientific of tests but to me the S7 Edge's touch response is slower. (I'll link the video once it's uploaded.)  \n\n__TL;DR You are mistaking WALT's measurements of faster taps and drags as superior than a whole operating system that is more optimized and responsive.__\n\nNo need to go around calling people frauds for their personal observations.

Which, again, Anandtech stopped including in their reviews because \"WALT's drag latency test seems to be highly unreliable and I'm kind of questionable on whether these results can really be trusted\".\n\nAs I've noted several times, when referring to /u/generalako and his post, who himself said this. He even did it in here.\n\n>In HTC's own product unveil for the HTC 10, HTC reported that the HTC 10 has a touch response of 120ms - https://pics.computerbase.de/7/1/6/7/4/1-1080.53763535.jpg. This is far off from WALT's 54ms. Do you trust WALT or the manufacturer of the phone?\n\nThat doesn't make any sense. Even the Anandtech test, which you yourself referred to above, talks about how they feel that the numbers (which for them is 54ms) are much higher than what they percieve. In other words, they are lower. The \"touch response\" in that picture must be referring to something else, because the kind of numbers HTC presented are way above anything that has ever been the case for either HTC or Samsung phones over the years.  \n\n>There is a big difference between touch latency meaning simple scrolling and touch latency meaning perceived responsiveness and real-world usage of a phone.\n\nYou have me confused here. Explain to me what you mean by \"real-world usage of a phone\"? We are talking about touch latency in terms of the time it takes for your finger to touch a display, until it responds, or scrolling/swiping on the display, and the delay it has with it. Nothing more.\n\n>by changing the order and priority of registering and rendering inputs and frames, which results in up to 40% reduced latency...\n\nYes, as \"described\" to them by a guy working for Google. Not as actually tested and proved. /u/generalako even had a discussion with one of the guys at XDA, who finally admitted to this, when they talked about the test by the Dutch review site. He said:\n\n\"I admit when I am wrong and I can see his results for swiping tests are accurate indeed, as **I've just recreated them and they do swipe near-identically overall**. We'll try and look into the matter further at XDA given that different touch events may correspond to different latencies, I am not sure if the single touch event latency is as good. If they are indeed equal there has been a gigantic placebo effect with respects to the Pixel XL. But Tweakers' swiping test and findings thereof do show that there isn't much of a difference there.\"\n\n>If you read at the bottom of OP's post you would have also seen this: \"perhaps the optimizations (of the Pixel) are not in touch latency of the finger to the registration, but at the time of registration of the contact to the corresponding action by the operating system\".\n\nThis is a sentence that I brought up several times with other members as well. Another thing that seemd to have completely passed by you.\n\nAnd you clearly have no understanding of \"touch latency\", do you? The thing you are talking about is latency in terms of actions in the OS/interface. It has NOTHING to do with touch latency.\n\n>Touch latency meaning real-world usage is what /u/Mehknic/ /u/heydabop/ /u/astrawnomore/ /u/BabysGotBends/ /u/johnnyboi1994 /u/yellowsn0wz/ /u/Randomd0g/ and I are referring to when we say the Pixel's is in a league of its own. \n\nAnd it has been proven to not be true, as noted by the guy from XDA above, from both looking at the Dutch review and recreating it himself. And from the fact that the majority of the users you mention, including yourself, never even own the OP3. You and all your fellow comrades mistake general OS speed to touch latency. Two very different things.\n\nFurthermore, the whole basis of the thread that you guys wrote your post in, and the one that several of you guys used as confirmation for that OP3 had latency issues, has its numbers from LN. The very site you just now said isn't worth caring about because of WALT. So which is it? Either the conclusions they came with about OP3 is true, as well as those of the Pixel, or they are both wrong?\n\n>No other Android version has the operating system level responsiveness improvements from 7.1.\n\nYou have no basis for saying this. You don't even know the touch latency of the Pixel itself.\n\n> Pixel's performance lead states \"we spent most of the time on performance consistency and touch latency. let's just say it paid off\"\n\nSo a twitter statement by Google is more factual than actual tests? Are you being serious?", "id": "damoomi"}, {"comment": "For the record I did say that the site should be discounted for the OP3 latency numbers as well.

You see, that site actually has done some testing on it and produced those numbers, whereas there's no test proving the Pixel having low latency. Btw, that same French site tested and proved 95ms delay on the OP3, which resulted in the complaint thread about OP3's latency that you wrote in (where you made claims that completely contradicted the site). There was also a Dutch reviewer from one of Netherland's biggest tech sites, who said he had tested them both and saw no real-world difference between them, whereas he a saw a difference when testing them up against the 7 Plus (which has a delay of about 40ms). You, on the other hand, see no difference between the 6S Plus (around 20ms in latency) and the Pixel XL (90ms latency)...\n\nI find it astounding how you can ask about the legitimacy of a test done by a site, whereas you in another post to another user said that 90ms delay for Pixel is BS because the VP of engineering at Google said otherwise. That right there shows really how serious you are about these things and about tests and numbers in general: you are willing to be either stupid and eat up everything, or critical and ask for \"more numbers\", when it fits your agenda.\n\n> Are you paid by OP because it sure seems like you go far out of your way to support them.\n\nSays the guy who said *\"[90ms delay on the Pixel] is complete BS.

I went to a Verizon store in October and looked at all three, and the 10 won me over hands-down.  The deciding factors were:\n\n* Sound quality.  The speakers on the 10 are loud and accurate.  I know they're not a true stereo, but the difference between having one front-facing speaker and none is immense.  Neither the S7 nor the Pixel came anywhere close.\n* Hardware/Design: I really dislike the glass piece on the back of the Pixel and the large bezels without a front-facing fingerprint scanner or capacitive buttons.  The footprint of the 10 wasn't much bigger than the Pixel even with the larger screen and buttons.  The slight curve to the 10's back makes it really comfortable to hold, and yet it's not curved enough to wobble on a table like my old Moto X did.  I do think that the S7 has a nicer design than either, but the 10 was much better than the Pixel in my eyes.  I couldn't get past the S7's button order though.  The back button goes on the left!\n* Bootloader unlock/root friendliness - great on both the 10 and Pixel, not so great on the S7.\n* SD slot.  I didn't think I needed one in the past, but now that I use one, it's hard to go back.  I keep all my media on a 128GB card so it's easy to swap between phones and have all my songs and pics.  Also great for TWRP backups.\n* Software: I find the latest iteration of Sense to be very stock-like, but I can't say the same about Touchwiz on the S7.\n* Price: I could have bought the Exynos S7 for $560 at B&H, but the Pixel was beyond my reach considering I would want the 128GB version.

I genuinely laughed out loud. ", "id": "dajr40c"}, {"comment": "Personally I do believe that it is not so much the marketing. I had my fair share of Android devices, but none of them could really satisfy me. \n\nWhen I got a Samsung, it usually had great hardware and a good screen, but the slow OS updates and bugs introduced by Samsung's version of Android bugged me without end. I always found some major bug that would not affect a significant enough amount of users to make Samsung care about it, but they were a deal breaker to me. One example: my online banking app that plays a video in the background of the login screen always crashes on the first launch and would just work if you open it the second time. I tried to reproduce on emulators and other devices, but it was just present on my S5.\n\nI got a Nexus 6P earlier this year. Not a bad phone, but it still has its flaws. The hardware was rather average compared to Samsung flagships. The display would not look as vivid and amazing as the one in the S6 Edge for example, and the maximum brightness would be a third of some other displays. I was not unhappy with the OS, but the performance was not as good as I would have liked - that may be an Android problem in general. Most will probably not care, but I, as a heavy user (and mobile app developer) don't like it when things are visibly un-smooth. Maybe other people have different concerns or do not care, because I rarely hear this mentioned in reviews. I always read about the latest Android flagship being \"buttersmooth\" and blazingly fast, etc. From my experience Android is far from that. If I open web pages in the browser, there is lag when scrolling. If there are animations in apps, I often notice frame drop. When I zoom on images, it just does not feel smooth. \n\nI now use an iPhone 7 and am quite pleased so far. The device always stays responsive. The frame rate seems consistent when zooming on images in the web browser and animations in general feel much smoother. Not once in my rather short iOS life did the keyboard fail to instantly respond. On Android, I regularly noticed the keyboard's animation and response to be stuck for a short moment while a website is loading or there are background processes like installing apps. iOS just never seems to not deliver a consistent frame rate and responsiveness. \nThe hardware and build quality is amazing. If course people can have other preferences, but personally I like the build and style of my iPhone very much. One could argue that at this price point they better be, but I still appreciate the build quality and design of the device.  The screen is much better than on the Nexus 6P. When I got my Nexus 6P people on XDA seemed enthusiastic about the battery life. It stands no chance compared to the iPhone 7. In the evening I'd be down to 20-30% with the Nexus 6P, now I'm at 64% as I'm typing this. All the doze and large battery hype, but still it does simply not come close. \n\nAbout the apps, there surely are good ones for iOS that are often more stable than their Android counterparts. However, the main thing I miss are some good apps that I used daily. There is just no app for public transit that can match the one I had on Android. Apple's strict policies are a huge disadvantage sometimes. No 4chan app. There don't seem to be advertisement policies in place. The wallpaper apps I find in the AppStore make me want to throw up. If you see more ads than wallpapers and a 30s interstitial is popping up before you even found a good wallpaper, something went very wrong. I was under the impression that there was less crap on the AppStore than on the PlayStore, but I quickly learned that this is not necessarily true. There can be better software on Android.\n\nI don't know why I'm writing this long paragraph about my buying decisions and smartphone experiences, I know no one will care, but here I am.\n\nOh and about that headphone jack every review loves to extensively address, I do not care too much about its removal. I don't own better earphones than the EarPods (which fit my ears very nicely) anyway. Only disadvantage remaining: I can't charge while listening, but this is a problem that I care about once a month at worst. Also, I'd be interested in getting the AirPods should they provide better sound quality. \n\nI realize that not many people use their phones as extensively as I do and not everyone is concerned about the issues I have with Android. Many simply don't want to spend that kind of money on a smartphone and I can't blame them. For me personally the iPhone is just the only smartphone that can deliver on every aspect I care about and makes me feel like I got the best device my money could buy.

Wife and me both shrug our shoulders.   Say \"hey google what does acronym mean\"    Google correctly answers.   Not happening on the Echo.   BTW, no remote to find or buttons to click or anything.\n\nListening to James Taylor and wife indicates he is married to Carly Simon.   Say \"hey google is james taylor married to carly simon\" and we get the answer that they were married and when.\n\nThese type of questions the Echo can not answer.    But the biggest difference is selecting songs and the size of the song catalog.   The Google Home pulls from YouTube so the selection is much bigger.   The Google Home is also much better at playing a song with little info.   So say just some lyrics and it will find the song and play.   Some example are \"hey google play gwen sting bottle\" and Gwen and Sting singing message in a bottle starts playing.   The Echo can not do this.   \n\nThe song catalog is so much larger.   So I love this song mummers dance.   With the Google Home I literally have over 20 versions.    Instrumental, orchestra, live, studio or Hayley Westenra version which I highly recommend.   The Echo does not have a single version of the song!     Another song I love is JD Blackfoot crazy horse.   Not playing on Echo even with Spotify.\n\nKid comes to me last minute that their game is away not home.   OMG, how far do we have to drive.   Hey Google, how far away is X high school.    Google gives me the distance, traffic with a detore apparently from a local running event.    The Echo did NOT even know the high school.\n\nBut my favorite things with the Google Home is how it drives the kids curiosity.   Most new things they play with it for a day or so.   But the Google Home they are constantly asking it questions about the world.\n\nAs I said we have both and love the Echo.  Do not get me wrong.   But to say these two devices are in the same league is simply not telling the truth.    We will keep the Echo in the kitchen and then have Google Home throughout the house.\n\nPS, one of my other favorite things with the Google Home is if you also have a Chromecast or AndroidTV as we have the Shield the Home will turn on your TV, set the input and display a video.

But basically, it'd be a almost permanently attached heart rate, blood pressure, body fat, hydration, etc. monitor that your doctors can ACTUALLY use (i.e., the standard needs to go through FDA trials).\n\n2) Access control. Basically, employees can duplicate their HID access cards for door access control, or commuters can use it as a subway fare card, etc..

I started developing last year because I have an interest in coding. I had no idea how to develop apps for android besides the fact that I can use Java. I already had Java experience from high school the year before (I am a 2nd year now). So I started by googling how to create a simple game in Android Studio. I would watch and try to copy what the tutorial was saying, but I didn't want to create the game the tutorial was making so I would do my own things here and there and I ended up with Dodge Blocks. I promoted it by telling all my friends, and putting up links on Facebook. I also put a post on reddit. Ive earned about $14 but I am not really doing this for the money at this point, I enjoy making apps and to me all my apps have been successes because I get an opportunity to learn and also bring enjoyment to my friends.\n\nI got the idea for Mafia when me and my friends wanted to play but we didn't have cards so we ripped up pieces of paper and wrote the roles on there and assigned each person a role that way. After I made the app I have used it a couple times to play and it is very helpful and a fun thing to talk about.\n\nI'm not sure if I want to still continue updating Dodge Blocks because I made the whole thing in Java (no XML), and I'm still not sure how exactly to solve some of the issues on there, but I definitely be updating Mafia and making it better with some ideas I already have.

I would watch and try to copy what the tutorial was saying, but I didn't want to create the game the tutorial was making so I would do my own things here and there and I ended up with Dodge Blocks. I promoted it by telling all my friends, and putting up links on Facebook. I also put a post on reddit.

In just eight months since releasing beta, Slide has had around 100k downloads and has become one of the one of the most popular Reddit/open source apps on Android (and soon iOS!), and has an amazing community and contributors that I'm grateful to be able to work with :)", "id": "daihry4"}], [{"comment": "I made a very simple app for a Reddit user a few years ago, called [US Timezones Clock](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sirpali.timezones).

The guy needed it since he lives in Europe (same here) and he was tired of always having to look up when events started in the US as he didn't know the current time in the US' timezones.\n\nI never did any promotion for it, it simply grew organically. Since I released it  has received an average of 2000 downloads per year, but as of 2015 this has increased to 10,000 downloads per year ([it's literally linear growth](http://imgur.com/a/Sw09K)). The last few months it has mostly been downloaded from India, probably in callcenters or something.\n\nI currently have 7631 active users, of which about 400 on a daily basis, with 30,619 total downloads. I added ads using StartApp in 2015 (banned from adsense when I was younger due to friends spamclicking my ads). I currently have an average of 500 impression per day, with a CTR of 5.18% and an eCPM of a whopping $0.15 (I blame it on the Indian users).

It's inefficient to memorize the definitions of thousands of words when there's no guarantee that even one of them will show up on the exam.\n\nSo I studied the most common latin roots. Those are guaranteed to show up on the exam. If you recognize a latin root in a word, then you can guess the definition of the word with some degree of accuracy. Example: The latin root \"luc\" means illumination and the word \"lucid\" means \"expressed clearly; easy to understand\" (from Google).\n\nI made this app so I could learn a bit about Android app development and thought it would benefit others (however, the SAT has been revised to the point where my app is no longer relevant to the SAT).\n\n>how you promote your app\n\nReddit, Google+\n\n>how much you earned from it\n\nIt's free.\n", "id": "dajk0u2"}], [{"comment": "Paging /u/ljdawson", "id": "dak7j89"}]]], "5fo2qg": ["OnePlus 3T Unboxing and A Few Extras!

It is a little confusing and the layout is rather cluttered. \n\nA few a suggestions from me would be these.\n\n    1: instead of suggestions containing the entire sentence at the top, make it to where it only shows the last word and its suggestion. id imagine that might make it run a bitmore smooth.\n\n    2: the actual line detection of where I\u2019m dragging my finger is a little off, I don\u2019t know if in used to other swipe style keyboards, but its petty prevalent in this one.\n\n    4: The menu is a tad confusing and some of the items are not the propper size so they extend outside their little outline area. The main tutorial was another thing, I couldn\u2019t get past the 3rd word, I believe, and ended up just exiting the tutorial.\n\n    5: If I hold down a letter on the top to bring up a number, it doesn\u2019t show the number. \n\n    6: I noticed during the tutorials that quite a few of them extended part the bottom of the screen making them unable to be read.\n\n    7: the prediction service is a little off as well, I try to s wipe the word I\u2019d but get either is or if, I had to physically type it in . Also if I swipe its or id or im, its or hers or anything containing an apostrophe, It doesn\u2019t include them but will for the word \u2019her\u2019s\u2019. All in all this part the dictionary seems a bit off.

I even have it on power save mode.\n\n    9: tap typing: its extremely hard to do with two fingers because of the aforementioned lag when its trying to keep up with sentence suggestions that it misses letter inputs and messes up the whole word, sometimes creating several different words. I m also having issues where I have to swipe a word several times to get the right one. I\u2019m not sure why, either, but a lot of times when im tapping words it gives me crazy other words, I. E. I tried to type swipe and got \u2018WW I on\u2019 and even \u2018CEO more\u2019 another time. \n\nI think with a little bit of fine tuning this can be a fantastic and ever day use keyboard.

But there were some things Apple just did smoother and more stable.\n\nMy first phone switch was a Samsung Galaxy Nexus (still works to this day). Great phone, but I had tons of issues with messaging. Apparantly if you had an iPhone, and switch to Android, your number gets stuck with iMessage and messages don't go through. It drove me crazy after a while and I switched back. There was no way of deregistering your number from iMessage at the time. Aside from that the iPhone had a more cleaned up notification system and Settings menu. Things are clear and easy to understand with very little frustration. Not to mention that they've always been very fast. \n\nFew years later as always, I got bored with the iPhone again and got a Galaxy S6 Edge. Beautiful phone. Same issues happened! Even after deregistering from iMessage. The phone also lagged after a while. So yet again, I switched back to an iPhone.\n\nFinally this time, when I switched to a Pixel XL,  I have to say, it's by far the best phone I've ever had. It's where Android should have been.

All cisc instructions are decoded into RISC instruction before being issued to the CPU's pipeline. While CISC allows for more operations to be set into the same instruction, it also makes it less flexible. Being able to split up an instruction into smaller steps allows you to be more flexible with the order in which you can do stuff, since it allows instructions to be executed out of order much simpler as well as data forwarding and branch prediction. Most performance increasing strategies now a days are dependent of trying to use the CPU as efficiently as possible eliminating all stalls and waits, and RISC architectures allow for greater flexibility in that aspect.

"], [88, "And he is absolutely right. Android N, like many other more important issues with OnePlus and OP3, should have higher priority -- not to mention that the latency will automatically be fixed with Android 7.1. As noted on the other posts, the overwhelming majority of OP3 users in there commented that they saw it as a non-issue. Most, like me, didn\u2019t realize it was one before it was brought up (neither did any reviewer, whether it was XDA or Anandtech, btw). And, incidentally, the people who blow the issue out of proportion are those who don\u2019t even own the OP3. Even [the forum thread on OnePlus' own forum](https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/touch-latency-on-the-oneplus-3-3t.475870/page-5) about the issue, has less than 1/10000 of registered users complaining about it.\n\nI do not know what is up with people on /r/Android and their need to constantly shit on the OP3 (many people were making comments like \"what did you expect from a mediocre Chinese company?\", \"the more I read about OP3, the more glad I am for never purchasing it\"). Is it because it has gotten great feedback from those who have purchased it, reviewers and others, while they are stuck with much more expensive flagships themselves (like the twice as expensive Pixel, which is far from perfect, btw)? OP3 seems to be held to a higher standard than any other phone in here.\n\n6 months ago, people were shitting on it for its color accuracy. Now it is [only behind the Galaxy S7 in best color accuracy of any Android phone, even crushing the Pixel in this regard](http://www.anandtech.com/show/10836/the-oneplus-3t-mini-review/2). Something which,  for me personally, is one of the most important aspects of a phone. People were shitting on it for not having more than 15 apps (because I'm supposed to believe that people actually multitask with more than 15 apps at once!) open in the background, and now it keeps more apps in the background than most (if not all) the leading flagship phones, crushing such flagships like the Galaxy S7 in multitasking performance. And on and on it continues. \n\nPeople talk about shitty customer support from OP3, but ever since they released their phone they have given us a pretty darn good sRGB mode, constantly improved camera software and better RAM management. Not to mention that the OP3 was one of the best SD820 devices in terms of raw performance, and when it came to throttling, according to [Arstechnica](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/06/oneplus-3-review-a-great-400-phone-you-can-actually-buy/). Moreover, pretty soon they will update the OP3 with a 20% bump in storage speeds, making the already lightning quick opening of apps even faster ([a test on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcTAXsFHu5I) shows that it is faster than even the iPhone 7 in this regard). In addition, I am sure by the time they have fixed touch latency, or even exceeded most other flagships in this regard, that this aspect of the phone will also be all but forgotten by you people. The same way the RAM management and color accuracy issues were.\n\nI could also go into such great features like their market leading finger print sensor or Dash charging (where charging makes the battery hot and degrades it faster with other devices), and how it\u2019s so \"terrible\" that other flagship phones can\u2019t be just as good. How OnePlus can increase the battery considerably without increasing thickness or weight, whereas other OEMs cannot do the same. How OnePlus, a small team of people, can create one of the most color accurate displays on a phone, whereas a company like Google cannot do the same for an $800 phone. \n\nYou would think a phone that cost so little for what it came with in terms of hardware, design, software and features, would be the phone to be the least criticized. Instead, the OP3 is heavily criticized, and most often by those who do not even own it.\n\n**How about you guys ask us OP3 owners how we feel about our phone, instead of telling us how we should feel about i?** I'm a smartphone enthusiast and I have tried/owned more or less every single flagship phone the past few years. I personally think that the OP3 is by far the best phone of 2016 (followed by the Pixel). I have also had no issues whatsoever with the touch latency. If I ever did, it would be very low on my list of things to care about on a phone. \n\n\n"], [42, "[deleted]"], [29, "**I did some research and found out some astounding facts that sheds more light on the stupidity of the complaint about OP3(T)'s touch latency.**\n\nEveryone uses Les Numeriques as their source for testing touch latency on displays.  The device they use to test with, the WALT Latency Timer, was used only once and then dropped for its \"unreliability\", by Anandtech. Anandtech themselves tested it with the HTC 10, and noted that the phone was noticeably more touch responsive than other phones, despite the test numbers showing it wasn\u2019t the case (the same numbers found by by LN).\nBut here comes the fun part. LN, the source that people use when they claim the OP3(T) has a delay of 95ms (because no other source has tested touch latency or claimed that number), [tested the Pixel]( http://www.lesnumeriques.com/telephone-portable/labo-google-pixel-pixel-xl-ecrans-amoled-qualite-n57543.html). They noted that the **Google Pixel had a touch latency of  90ms**. That\u2019s 4-5ms less than what they found the OP3(T) to have.

On the other you have a few dozen angry OP3 owners, the rest being people who don\u2019t own the OP3, who criticize it, as well as hailing the Pixel for its fantastic and market leading touch latency.

Android N, like many other more important issues with OnePlus and OP3, should have higher priority -- not to mention that the latency will automatically be fixed with Android 7.1. As noted on the other posts, the overwhelming majority of OP3 users in there commented that they saw it as a non-issue. Most, like me, didn\u2019t realize it was one before it was brought up (neither did any reviewer, whether it was XDA or Anandtech, btw). And, incidentally, the people who blow the issue out of proportion are those who don\u2019t even own the OP3. Even [the forum thread on OnePlus' own forum](https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/touch-latency-on-the-oneplus-3-3t.475870/page-5) about the issue, has less than 1/10000 of registered users complaining about it.\n\nI do not know what is up with people on /r/Android and their need to constantly shit on the OP3 (many people were making comments like \"what did you expect from a mediocre Chinese company?\", \"the more I read about OP3, the more glad I am for never purchasing it\"). Is it because it has gotten great feedback from those who have purchased it, reviewers and others, while they are stuck with much more expensive flagships themselves (like the twice as expensive Pixel, which is far from perfect, btw)? OP3 seems to be held to a higher standard than any other phone in here.\n\n6 months ago, people were shitting on it for its color accuracy. Now it is [only behind the Galaxy S7 in best color accuracy of any Android phone, even crushing the Pixel in this regard](http://www.anandtech.com/show/10836/the-oneplus-3t-mini-review/2). Something which,  for me personally, is one of the most important aspects of a phone. People were shitting on it for not having more than 15 apps (because I'm supposed to believe that people actually multitask with more than 15 apps at once!) open in the background, and now it keeps more apps in the background than most (if not all) the leading flagship phones, crushing such flagships like the Galaxy S7 in multitasking performance. And on and on it continues. \n\nPeople talk about shitty customer support from OP3, but ever since they released their phone they have given us a pretty darn good sRGB mode, constantly improved camera software and better RAM management. Not to mention that the OP3 was one of the best SD820 devices in terms of raw performance, and when it came to throttling, according to [Arstechnica](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/06/oneplus-3-review-a-great-400-phone-you-can-actually-buy/). Moreover, pretty soon they will update the OP3 with a 20% bump in storage speeds, making the already lightning quick opening of apps even faster ([a test on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcTAXsFHu5I) shows that it is faster than even the iPhone 7 in this regard). In addition, I am sure by the time they have fixed touch latency, or even exceeded most other flagships in this regard, that this aspect of the phone will also be all but forgotten by you people. The same way the RAM management and color accuracy issues were.\n\nI could also go into such great features like their market leading finger print sensor or Dash charging (where charging makes the battery hot and degrades it faster with other devices), and how it\u2019s so \"terrible\" that other flagship phones can\u2019t be just as good. How OnePlus can increase the battery considerably without increasing thickness or weight, whereas other OEMs cannot do the same. How OnePlus, a small team of people, can create one of the most color accurate displays on a phone, whereas a company like Google cannot do the same for an $800 phone. \n\nYou would think a phone that cost so little for what it came with in terms of hardware, design, software and features, would be the phone to be the least criticized. Instead, the OP3 is heavily criticized, and most often by those who do not even own it.\n\n**How about you guys ask us OP3 owners how we feel about our phone, instead of telling us how we should feel about i?** I'm a smartphone enthusiast and I have tried/owned more or less every single flagship phone the past few years. I personally think that the OP3 is by far the best phone of 2016 (followed by the Pixel). I have also had no issues whatsoever with the touch latency. If I ever did, it would be very low on my list of things to care about on a phone. \n\n\n", "id": "dalswjn"}, {"comment": "You just said what I've been wanting to say for months.

LG Optimus G was close 84ms. Nexus 5 was comparable at 75ms. Galaxy Note 3 was the best at 67ms.\n\n* iPhone 6 (2014): I already mentioned the M8 having better latency than the iPhone 6 models (this was 1 example). The Z3 Compact was also better at 51ms. The Note Edge, which boasted a whopping 27ms response time (the best of its generation), has far better. The Note 4 and Huawei Ascend P7 matched them at 68ms and 66ms respectively.

But you still had competitve Android flagships that still performed well. Z5 Compact at 30ms, S6 and S6 Edge at 35ms, to give you some examples.\n\n* iPhone 7 (2016): For iPhone 7, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus regressed from their predecessors and were at 41ms and 43 ms respectively.

The 6P never, ever was able to get much past 2 hours with the exact same usage pattern without being around 10-12% battery.\n\n2 days ago I forgot for the first time to charge my phone over night.

I've never had a phone yet that was able to not make me worry, but this one does just that.  It fits my use case perfectly to be honest, and the Pixel is easily the best Android phone I've ever had.
