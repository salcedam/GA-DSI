Injuries to Dlo and Uncle P aren't sitting well for the next stretch of games, and the lack of a true number 1 guy / near all-star caliber player hurts in the brutal West.

In the void of Bill Simmons's writing in my life, I've found that this place has a similar mixture of fanatic homerism mixed with well versed ideas, and I love it. Also I always watch the lakers but this sub is a great way for me to keep tabs on teams I'll never watch on a consistent basis.\n\n2. Based on recent performance, I power rank them at 16, but if I had to guess end of the year ranking I would say 21. While I'm extremely hopeful that the Lakers can keep this up, the .500 record feels a lot like unsustainable overachieving. Injuries to Dlo and Uncle P aren't sitting well for the next stretch of games, and the lack of a true number 1 guy / near all-star caliber player hurts in the brutal West. But right now I'm impressed that these Lakers have hovered at .500 with such a difficult stretch of recent games. \n\n3. At least 5 times a day. I definitely get to reading (almost) everything on the hot page\n\n4. On average I watch 5 games a week (all Lakers games for sure).

I'd rather hear the commentary of an average NBA fan like ourselves than some uninformed \"analyst\" on sites like Bleacher Report and ESPN. So I do believe that r/NBA thrives off of its excellency in the diversity of opinions, and basically internet communism. Something I would like to see happen though would be greater open discussions on specific players and teams, in order to get broader opinions on individuals and eliminate hivemind.\n2. Love my Lakers, but with and entirely injured backcourt, were not exactly tough to beat. We're somewhere near the top of the second half of the league, and with our competition in the west for the 8th seed rolling (Utah, Houston, OKC), I'd put us around 19 currently. Look for us to improve as our starters come back, though.\n3. I'm on here a several times a day. As a full time student, I don't have too many responsibilities to cater to on a daily basis, so I frequent the sub on my down time often, every couple hours.\n4. I'm yet to miss a Laker game, so every Laker game thus far, as well as 2-3 other games per day, though some at the same time if necessary. In total, probably about 20-25 a week.\n5.

Without dlo and nick I think we are in the lower teens/upper 20's at around 19-22.

There are two options:\n\nHe makes the shot: 0.45\n\nHe misses the shot: 0.55\n\nLet's say the Wiz can design a play to get a 35% shot with 6 seconds left. (we'll stick with  only 2's for simplicity's sake)\n\nOdds of Kawhi hitting shot and Wiz hitting shot (Overtime): (0.45)(0.35) = 0.1575\n\nOdds of Kawhi hitting shot and Wiz missing (Spurs Win): (0.45)(0.65) = 0.2925\n\nOdds of Kawhi Missing and Wiz hitting (Spurs lose): (0.55)(0.35) = 0.1925\n\nOdds of Kawhi Missing and Wiz Missing (Overtime): (0.55)(0.65) = 0.3575\n\nSo in this example, the Spurs have a 29.25% chance of winning, a 19.25% chance of losing and a 51.5% chance of going to Overtime. Assuming Overtime is 50/50, that gives you an expected win percentage of 55% (0.2925x1)+(19.25x0)+(0.515x0.5)\n\nAssuming the Spurs hold for the last shot, and, like the Wiz, they can get a 35% shot. \n\nSpurs have a 35% chance of hitting the shot and winning versus a 65% chance of going to overtime. Giving you an expected win percentage of 67.5%: (0.35x1)+(0.65x0.5)\n\nYou lose a 12.5% chance at victory by taking that shot. Obviously these percentages aren't exact and there's other variables (turnovers, fouls, 3 pointers, etc.).

He's one of the 3 positions that needs heavy improvements, hence why we signed a 64m player. He is an offensive liability besides running the easy P&R with Wall.

He has 0 chemistry and is of no use to players other than Wall who aren't actively dumping off to him in his perfect spots. \n\nOn defense he's generally slow footed, and gets dominated by guys like Whiteside. He relies on constant fouling, back pushing, jersey grabbing, etc to get through his assignments, so refs aren't happy to give our team any leeway with touch fouls in general.

Not necessarily, but he does bring a level of rim protection that the Celtics haven't had in a while.  In addition, he can defend the perimeter decently as well.  This kind of defensive versatility reminds me (personally) of how Duncan transformed the Spurs defense, to a lesser degree of course (can't stress this enough).  \n\nOn offense, Horford's currently shooting .581 on 2% shots, that's with a healthy combination of midrange jumpers and layups around the rim.  Duncan also had similar offensive versatility, being able to easily make shots around the rim, and shoot some pretty sweet bank shots from mid-court.  Again, these two players show similarities, and I would argue that the offensive differences between Al and Tim are a lot less than the defensive differences.\n\nAre they the exact same player?  Obviously not.  Tim was an ALL-TIME GREAT defender, and Horford has a 3 ball.  But for some reason saying Horford is close in terms of the type of player he is to Tim is really pissing people off.

Adderall, coffee, nicotine, alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, and shrooms are just some drugs that people take and can still be productive or even enhance their lives.

However, anything you enjoy is addicting. Gambling, porn, sex, fighting, or whatever can become problematic when it controls your life. Think back to high school of all the pot heads or even in college, yes some of them became very successful, but be honest here how many failed to become anything more than just a leech in society? This is what Watson is getting at. Kids are impressionable and do not fully educate themselves in matters typically. Hell even adults do the same, they hear one to two opinions and treat it as law. If you do not believe, look at how many believe that vaccines are evil. Gluten-free is the cure to anything, unless you have celiac disease you really do not have to eat gluten-free stuff. \n\nThe Warriors are this generations Chicago Bulls and they have TV personality. While I agree fully in their statements, their audience is not just NFL leaders, NBA leaders, or their respective league's rulemakers; it is to the whole population. Hell even Kerr's comments made it to a top thread in /news/ yesterday. \n\nYes Marijuana's laws should be repealed, but what I see in all of this is a lack of education on the manner. Despite all the education and constantly display of risks of alcohol/nicotine, there are still drunk drivers and people getting cancer. Marijuana may boost the economy, but let's see how it effects its users. I may not live in a state that permits recreational marijuana use just allowing edible treats. But a majority of the workers at one of the companies I worked with attracted a lot of addicts who used their paycheck to funnel their addictions and the pot heads while very cooperative and hard working got fired a lot due to truancy.

So you didn't provide any evidence to counter his points.", "id": "daq3g5b"}, {"comment": "great post. \n\nreddit is a dangerous place to speak negatively about weed, because so many redditors smoke and don't want to question their habit-- or they put cannabis on this untouchable pedestal of perfection. I know, because that used to be me. \n\nWhen I look back on my years of smoking, the saddest thing is this: while I was a stoner, the only *truly* rewarding part of my life was getting high.\n\nSure, I'd do all kinds of cool things, hang with friends, ball it up, make elaborate meals, create stuff, listen to music and whatnot. And maybe it was great at the time. But in a big picture sense-- in retrospect-- nothing was really happening. I spent thousands of dollars in order to be numb from everything, to let life pass by while I existed in psuedo-bliss. Even at work or at school- when I wasn't high at the time- I was hugely affected by having smoked the night before, or a few days before. It's hard to see while you're in the middle of it, but looking back it is crystal clear.  \n\nI quit for about three years in my mid twenties, and it took about 9 months to feel 100% normal again. In those few years, I had more meaningful experiences and more lasting memories than in the previous 7+ years of smoking frequently. \n\nit definitely triggers psychosis in me though, so I might be on the more extreme end of things. whereas some people can't stop drinking after one drink, when I get high off some quality herb, the next day I want to get back there-- and I feel like something is missing until I do. I'm sure a lot of people feel this way, but have a hard time admitting it to themselves.\n\n\nOne of the best parts about not smoking imo is that you wake up and feel fine. You don't *need* anything (except maybe coffee and food). When you're smoking regularly, you need more weed to reach equilibrium. Like Tyrion Lannister says, \"if you drink, you need to keep drinking\". High-grade cannabis is similar.  \n\nWhen I started smoking again after 3 years without it, I thought maybe things would be different, because I was older, more mature, and had grown during that time.\n\nNope.\n\nWithin a couple weeks, most facets of life had gone downhill. Calling in sick to work, horrid physical endurance, random spikes in anxiety, less enjoyment of my hobbies, weekends where I sat around doing nothing and come Monday had no clue what I'd really done... uncontrollable late night sugar binges. Oh, and I looked like absolute shit.\n\nAnd that's only the tip of how chronic smoking negatively affects me. \n\nMaybe it's all positive for some folks, but the studies coming out about structural brain changes, altered development in teens, loads of support forums, and M.A. meetings in every city suggest that maybe cannabis isn't this do-no-harm flower of the Gods that many people (particularly stoners) will lead you to believe. \n\nHave any of you read *Infinite Jest*? The 3rd chapter might be the most accurate portrayal of the negatives of marijuana use ever recorded. Highly recommended. \n\n\nhaving said all that, I'm stoked herb is legal in California! it's about damn time.

You know what the whole team can't defend for crap"], [5, "First, the bench is awful. They have no dependable 6th option to help switch things up tactically. When they go to the bench every sub is a strict downgrade, which makes it hard to stagger the minutes of non-complementary players such as Wiggins/Lavine, etc. \n\nThen there are the starters. They are all nice pieces taken independently but are clearly lesser than the sum of their parts. There's significant overlap in the pros and cons of Wiggins and Lavine (roughly, pros: scoring, athleticism; cons: defense, bbiq, youth). Towns also isn't seasoned enough defensively to be the primary big. This places a heavy burden on Dieng to be a defensive monster, which he is not. Then there's Rubio who's always injured and isn't a complete enough of a player to be a threat at lead guard. \n\nOn the whole, the team is too young and inexperienced. I still think the wolves are missing the type of veteran presence Garnett and Prince brought last year. Even a solid but unspectacular veteran big (or veteran wing defender) to soak up some starter minutes would help.

Their bench kind of sucks too."], [3, "They're ridiculously young and inexperienced and they haven't figured out how to play at the elite level (4th in the league in 1st half scoring differential) that they're capable of for a full game. They're still raw on the defensive end and struggle massively in the third quarter - they haven't figured out how to make adjustments at halftime, but they play 3 great quarters almost every game. Another issue is that only one of the young big 3 seems capable of putting together a big game at a time. When they put things together they'll be able to hang with the best."], [3, "IMO Thibs overrated now, and by a decent amount by the general populace.  He's not adaptive as a coach nor flexible enough to get the best out of his players especially on offense.  He's also not really a inspiring coach, sure you have guys that liked him but I don't remember any player raving about him the way players rave about Pop or Kerr.  His one big strength as a coach, namely his defensive schemes, have been largely caught on by the rest of the league who implanted parts of his defensive teaching one way or another into their schemes.  \n\nPlayer wise Minnesota's big 3 haven't improved as much as people thought they would.  Towns got even more skilled and crafty on offense but doesn't seem to be putting in as much effort in defense as last year (advanced statistical defense stats will support this).

"], [29, "So this probably isn't the best place to get on my soap box, and I realize that since this is reddit I probably won't be received well, but I feel very compelled for some reason to say something about marijuana. I'm a medical student, so obviously not the best authority on psychiatry or anything, but my time on the drug abuse service really changed my view on drug use in general. I have two review articles cited below which I derived a lot of my information from if anyone is interested in reading more (from, for what its worth, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association which are among the most prestigious medical journals).\n\nFor one, there's a common myth that I see propagated that marijuana is more or less harmless and not addictive. It is true that it does not cause physiologic dependence via a withdrawal effect in the same way as say alcohol, nicotine, or opioids (heroin, morphine, etc) do. However, about 9% of people who experiment with marijuana, 17% who begin use in adolescence, and 25-50% of daily users become addicted (based on addiction criteria from DSM, the guidelines used by psychiatrists to define psychiatric disorders like addiction). In terms of its adverse health effects, there isn't much research regarding the long term effects. Some evidence we do have: driving while high has a similar effect on increasing risk for accidents as driving drunk, use is associated with anxiety, depression, and psychotic disorders (though that is correlation rather than causation), cognitive impairment, impaired brain development when used by people before their mid-20s, severe chronic bronchitis (for the smoked form), and some preliminary evidence of increased risk of stroke, heart attacks, and peripheral artery disease. I feel like comparisons to alcohol and smoking (which are obviously legal) are often drawn, and in all likelihood, chronic marijuana use is probably not as harmful as either of those things. Although, I don't think those are the best things to use as comparisons: both are among the most prevalent causes of preventable death in the US. Compare this to say, caffeine, which is widely used but almost certainly not as detrimental to health compared to marijuana.\n\nIn addition, my opinion is that medically prescribed use of drugs is fundamentally different from recreational use. After all, we use things like morphine (which is more or less heroin), cocaine (anesthetic procedures), codeine, methylphenidate (Ritalin) to high effect in the right medical context. Kerr is right that opioids (like Vicodin) should not be handed out like candy, and that their use has to be carefully considered. I do think though that discussion of medical use of cannabinoids to treat pain is fundamentally different from the league allowing recreational cannabis use. Also, there are cannabinoid like drugs that do not have the psychoactive effects of marijuana smoking (e.g. dronabinol). I think for medical indications, research and approval should go towards such targeted drugs (rather than simply smoking marijuana as a treatment). The only FDA approved indications for cannabinoid use are for nausea and vomiting with cancer chemotherapy and for appetite stimulation in HIV or cancer. Beyond these indications, there is also strong evidence for benefit for chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. That is not to say other things will be discovered later, but do keep in mind that controlled, appropriate medical use is a very specific scenario. I personally think that handing out marijuana prescriptions to anyone who just wants to smoke weed to get high is at best irresponsible.\n\nNow I don't say any of this to suggest that marijuana should not be legalized or that it should be considered taboo, but I think there are more layers to the discussion that are sometimes not addressed. It's different to say that people should be allowed to smoke marijuana and accept the risks of use, in the same way people engage in other unhealthy but pleasurable activities like sex with strangers, smoking, heavy alcohol drinking, or eating fast food. What bothers me are that common arguments in favor of legalization include the suggestion that it really isn't harmful (which is blatantly false) and a reference to its medical benefits (which as I say, I believe are fundamentally different from recreational use, and should be regulated as such) almost as if to suggest that smoking marijuana is actually good for you. Wow that ended up being way longer than I thought lol.\n\nSources: \n\nVolkow ND, Baler RD, Compton WM, Weiss, SR. Adverse Health Effects of Marijuana Use. N Engl J Med 2014;370:2219-27.\n\nHill, KP.

Marijuana laws put a high burden on law enforcement and the prison system for a relatively minor crime\n\nWhat I am trying to argue is that the following, which I frequently see, are BAD arguments:\n\n1. Marijuana smoking is not harmful/is minimally harmful (this not true)\n\n2. Marijuana is not addictive (this not true)\n\n3. Marijuana has proven medical benefits (while true, this doesn't mean much for recreational use. Also, the evidence for the benefit of medical marijuana is more limited than it is sometimes made out to be and more specific cannabinoid receptor-agonists are available)\n"], [20, "With Jeff Sessions we're all fucked."], [12, "This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18190785/steve-kerr-says-used-marijuana-back-pain-hopes-leagues-soften-stance) reduced by 79%.

I'm a medical student, so obviously not the best authority on psychiatry or anything, but my time on the drug abuse service really changed my view on drug use in general. I have two review articles cited below which I derived a lot of my information from if anyone is interested in reading more (from, for what its worth, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association which are among the most prestigious medical journals).\n\nFor one, there's a common myth that I see propagated that marijuana is more or less harmless and not addictive. It is true that it does not cause physiologic dependence via a withdrawal effect in the same way as say alcohol, nicotine, or opioids (heroin, morphine, etc) do. However, about 9% of people who experiment with marijuana, 17% who begin use in adolescence, and 25-50% of daily users become addicted (based on addiction criteria from DSM, the guidelines used by psychiatrists to define psychiatric disorders like addiction). In terms of its adverse health effects, there isn't much research regarding the long term effects. Some evidence we do have: driving while high has a similar effect on increasing risk for accidents as driving drunk, use is associated with anxiety, depression, and psychotic disorders (though that is correlation rather than causation), cognitive impairment, impaired brain development when used by people before their mid-20s, severe chronic bronchitis (for the smoked form), and some preliminary evidence of increased risk of stroke, heart attacks, and peripheral artery disease. I feel like comparisons to alcohol and smoking (which are obviously legal) are often drawn, and in all likelihood, chronic marijuana use is probably not as harmful as either of those things. Although, I don't think those are the best things to use as comparisons: both are among the most prevalent causes of preventable death in the US. Compare this to say, caffeine, which is widely used but almost certainly not as detrimental to health compared to marijuana.\n\nIn addition, my opinion is that medically prescribed use of drugs is fundamentally different from recreational use. After all, we use things like morphine (which is more or less heroin), cocaine (anesthetic procedures), codeine, methylphenidate (Ritalin) to high effect in the right medical context. Kerr is right that opioids (like Vicodin) should not be handed out like candy, and that their use has to be carefully considered. I do think though that discussion of medical use of cannabinoids to treat pain is fundamentally different from the league allowing recreational cannabis use. Also, there are cannabinoid like drugs that do not have the psychoactive effects of marijuana smoking (e.g. dronabinol). I think for medical indications, research and approval should go towards such targeted drugs (rather than simply smoking marijuana as a treatment). The only FDA approved indications for cannabinoid use are for nausea and vomiting with cancer chemotherapy and for appetite stimulation in HIV or cancer. Beyond these indications, there is also strong evidence for benefit for chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. That is not to say other things will be discovered later, but do keep in mind that controlled, appropriate medical use is a very specific scenario. I personally think that handing out marijuana prescriptions to anyone who just wants to smoke weed to get high is at best irresponsible.\n\nNow I don't say any of this to suggest that marijuana should not be legalized or that it should be considered taboo, but I think there are more layers to the discussion that are sometimes not addressed. It's different to say that people should be allowed to smoke marijuana and accept the risks of use, in the same way people engage in other unhealthy but pleasurable activities like sex with strangers, smoking, heavy alcohol drinking, or eating fast food. What bothers me are that common arguments in favor of legalization include the suggestion that it really isn't harmful (which is blatantly false) and a reference to its medical benefits (which as I say, I believe are fundamentally different from recreational use, and should be regulated as such) almost as if to suggest that smoking marijuana is actually good for you. Wow that ended up being way longer than I thought lol.\n\nSources: \n\nVolkow ND, Baler RD, Compton WM, Weiss, SR. Adverse Health Effects of Marijuana Use. N Engl J Med 2014;370:2219-27.\n\nHill, KP.

I'm an adult and should be allowed to do what I want with my body\n\n2. Drug illegalization is an ineffective strategy for reducing use as evidenced by Prohibition and the War on Drugs\n\n3. Marijuana laws put a high burden on law enforcement and the prison system for a relatively minor crime\n\nWhat I am trying to argue is that the following, which I frequently see, are BAD arguments:\n\n1. Marijuana smoking is not harmful/is minimally harmful (this not true)\n\n2. Marijuana is not addictive (this not true)\n\n3. Marijuana has proven medical benefits (while true, this doesn't mean much for recreational use.

Cannabis looks like a gift in comparison.\n\n>  In terms of its adverse health effects, there isn't much research regarding the long term effects. Some evidence we do have: driving while high has a similar effect on increasing risk for accidents as driving drunk\n\nSo vague and ill defined as to be signifying nothing. What were the doses? The strains? The differences from individual to individual?\n\nMore more studies are needed before any conclusion about weed in the system means impairment. It's not an easy question to answer like it is with alcohol, which requires very little context.\n\n> use is associated with anxiety\n\nAnd? which strain? How much CBD was there? Did the strains with high CBD cause anxiety? Did they in fact lower anxiety?\n\nWithout answering these question, you hardly have anything against cannabis in this area as well. The opposite seems likely. Just look at CDB and other trace cannabinoids we are only beginning to learn about. It is NOT all about THC.\n\n> depression, and psychotic disorders (though that is correlation rather than causation)\n\nsee above.\n\n> cognitive impairment\n\nWhich is limited, temporary, and relived to a great extent by COX-2 targeting anti inflammatories like Ibuprofen ( which are bad for your heart ( or panax ginseng and longvida curcumin ( which are not bad for your heart.\n\nThere are other, safer ways for achieving this same goal without NSAIDs. NSAIDs have recently been linked to heart disease.\n\nIbuprofen-like painkillers linked to an increased risk of heart failure\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2016-09-29-ibuprofen-like-painkillers-linked-to-an-increased-risk-of-heart-failure/\n\nwhere as a supplement like Longvida Curcumin, or panax ginseng extract not only reduce inflammation ( through the COX-2 pathway, IIRC ) and are actually a good preventative measure for vascular disease.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3915333/\n\nhttps://examine.com/supplements/panax-ginseng/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=longvida+cox-2\n\nJust make sure you buy ginseng from a company that has a sterling reputation. I know of 1 when it comes to ginseng, but there are probably more out there. there is also a lot of companies that don't really test for ginsenosides. Stay away from those. Also, Longvida is best purchased in \"bulk\" powder. Basically it's a better price if it is uncapped. 60 gram jar lasts a while as typical doses are from 200 - 650 mg per day. And the ginseng dose is 200 - 300 mg 2 - 3x per day, sublingually. GS15-4 is a form of ginseng that has very strong lab results for humans in terms of memory. \n\n> impaired brain development when used by people before their mid-20s\n\nThis is a concern for any psychoactive substance. And there is a hierarchy of concern. Once again, not even a medium sized knock on cannabis.\n\n> and some preliminary evidence of increased risk of stroke, heart attacks, and peripheral artery disease.\n\nPreliminary indeed. Considering the anti inflammatory properties of cannabis, and considering the diseases listed are a result of too much chronic inflammation, that's a corrolation does not equal causation thing. Lifestyle and diet choices being the likely major culprits.\n\n> I feel like comparisons to alcohol and smoking (which are obviously legal) are often drawn, and in all likelihood, chronic marijuana use is probably not as harmful as either of those things.\n\nIn all likelihood, the sun will rise tomorrow. \n\n> Compare this to say, caffeine, which is widely used but almost certainly not as detrimental to health compared to marijuana.\n\nWrong. Deaths from caffeine overdoses. Look it up. 1 tablespoon of caffeine has fucking ended people. \n\n>  I do think though that discussion of medical use of cannabinoids to treat pain is fundamentally different from the league allowing recreational cannabis use. \n\nWhy? Maybe we should discuss banning recreational alcohol as well?\n\n>  I personally think that handing out marijuana prescriptions to anyone who just wants to smoke weed to get high is at best irresponsible.\n\nDo you also think selling alcohol to grown ass people is \"at best irresponsible.\"? \n\nNo? Yes?\n\n> What bothers me are that common arguments in favor of legalization include the suggestion that it really isn't harmful\n\nThe government has no business telling us that we can't enjoy cannabis as adults, when we already legalized far more dangerous substances with NO medical value for the same purpose. \n\nThat you are \"bothered\" shows just how pernicious the propaganda surrounding cannabis is.\n\nNot to mention the fact that alcohol prohibition and the war on drugs ARE UTTER FUCKING DISASTERS.\n\n> Now I don't say any of this to suggest that marijuana should not be legalized\n\nFantastic!\n\n> What bothers me are that common arguments in favor of legalization include the suggestion that it really isn't harmful (which is blatantly false) and a reference to its medical benefits (which as I say, I believe are fundamentally different from recreational use, and should be regulated as such)\n\nYeah. It's called selling weed to grown people who wish to purchase it.. End of story.\n\n> almost as if to suggest that smoking marijuana is actually good for you.\n\nI have to quote you\n\n> The only FDA approved indications for cannabinoid use are for nausea and vomiting with cancer chemotherapy and for appetite stimulation in HIV or cancer. Beyond these indications, there is also strong evidence for benefit for chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. That is not to say other things will be discovered later...\n\nSo there ARE things about it that are good for you? Unlike legal highs? Interesting.\n\nMaybe if we just legalize it already, we could study it the right way. \n\nNot to mention that whether or  not some people describe it as only good without any downside, has nothing to do with anything.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "daqq76u"}, {"comment": "oh NO HE DI-IN'T", "id": "daqqxnr"}, {"comment": "My man did his research!\n", "id": "daqrvt9"}, {"comment": "I appreciate the effort you put into this. Again, I just want to emphasize that **I didn't say any of this to suggest that marijuana should be legalized or that it shouldn't be destigmatized**. I think that is an entirely different argument from what I present. What I am trying to argue is that 1) the idea that marijuana is harmless is false and 2) that arguments about recreational use of marijuana and medical use should be separated (but arguments citing medical benefits of marijuana are often used to promote recreational use). Here are some of my thoughts regarding what you said:\n\n1. I think people often confuse the fact that the reason why there is little evidence of harm with marijuana. The reason why is that it is poorly studied (most primarily because of poor reporting and difficulty separating its effects from use of other drugs). However, I think somewhere this has been confused with meaning that there is little evidence of harm because there is in fact little harm, which is not true. I listed a few of them, but if the list I provided was not satisfying, the two primary articles provide more details and evidence, and are also from a source with much greater authority in the scientific community than me.\n\n2. You asked for specifics regarding dose and such. I did not provide this information because I don't think it was necessary for the intended audience (r/nba lol). However, the NEJM review article I cited does in fact talk about the actual marijuana levels in people's blood and provides more numbers than I did. The primary article that the review article cites in turn provides even greater detail. The review article I referenced provides greater detail on some of the other deleterious health effects I referenced, which may answer some of your concerns. I would recommend reading that to anyone who wants more details rather than assuming that I just made this stuff up.\n\n3. As you say, marijuana overdose in typically used doses is not life-threatening. You then compare it to opioids, but my argument is not that it is worse than opioids or alcohol or smoking (I doubt it is). This is a strawman that I often see used. The fact that these drugs are worse for you than marijuana does not mean that marijuana is not bad for you. Neither is my argument that it is a worse painkiller than NSAIDs (though I doubt smoking marijuana is a more effective and safer treatment for pain solution than NSAIDs). \n\n4. In response to: \n\n>Do you also think selling alcohol to grown ass people is \"at best irresponsible.\" No? Yes?\n\nI don't think this is analogous to the situation I was describing. A better analogy would be prescribing Vicodin to people who do not have any medical indication for using it, and plan on using it only for its euphoric effects (i.e. giving a patient something for recreational use under the pretense of medical use). I do believe that that is irresponsible. There is a very clear role for opioids in medical practice, and the same is being discovered for cannabinoids. However, this doesn't necessarily mean anything for their recreational use. You would be insane to not refuse to take some morphine or some other opioid after a major abdominal surgery, and I would consider extremely uncompassionate to refuse to offer it in that situation. However, if anyone ever asks me if they should try injecting themselves morphine solely for the euphoric effects, I would give an very strong recommendation against it.\n\n5. Again, it is never my argument that adults should not be allowed to evaluate the pros and cons of smoking marijuana, but rather that there are clear cons and that claims made otherwise (which I see frequently) are false.\n\nI hope nothing I said came across as a hate tirade against marijuana. I did try to present things from a medical, evidence-based perspective to show that there are harmful effects of marijuana that I often see denied.

Water can kill you if you drink too much at once. Does that mean we should go around saying \"water is dangerous\"?\n\n\nWithout quantifying your claims, they amount to nothing. context matters. A lot!\n\nSaying \"it's not harmless\" adds nothing to any conversation, anywhere.\n\n> 2) that arguments about recreational use of marijuana and medical use should be separated \n\nYou already agreed that it should be legal.

The point is, there was no mechanism built into the study to determine tolerance, individual abilities and reaction time in relation to various cannabinoids. Until such a study is done, the data does not elucidate specifics on the effects of various cannabinoids.\n\n> As you say, marijuana overdose in typically used doses is not life-threatening.\n\nAHHH no! How about AT ANY FUCKING DOSE. It is NON lethal. Period.\n\n> You then compare it to opioids, but my argument is not that it is worse than opioids or alcohol or smoking (I doubt it is). \n\nObviously because people use opioids or pot for pain.

I already linked the evidence from PUBMED. The evidence against NSAIDS is damning in comparison to cannabis in terms of heart health. \n\nBesides, I was linking that info because of the effect that COX 2 anti inflammatories have on the short term memory impairment of cannabis.

If it was legal, there would not be people like you running around talking about \"dangerous over prescription of weed\" \n\nMaybe fucking legalize it, and people can bypass their doctors to get it.

( like AGW ). The fact that it's not federally acceptable to go in a store and buy weed is nothing short of the government acting as a traitor toward its citizens. Plain and fucking simple.\n\nBringing up opiates and booze is NEVER irrelevant when it comes to the legalization of weed.\n\nSo what if some people say it has no side effects, ever?

A top 16 playoff system would the solution but that would be a logistical nightmare if teams on the pacific coast and teams on the Atlantic competing against each other.\n\nMany of the tiebreakers are based off division record and western conference record but if you only played each team twice it wouldn't be a good way to break a tie. You play the teams in your division and in your conference more than the others so it gauges who is the more deserving team.\n\nThe other big tiebreaker that would be obsolete is head to head tie breaker. Take the nuggets and Jazz for example. So far we had split the season series, but we still have two more games to help show who is the better team. If we were to tie our overall records we would have to go to the final couple of tie breakers.\n\nThat is win loss record against playoff teams in your conference, and then win loss record against playoff teams in the other conference. Conferences don't hold any strength in this 58 game season so it would make it just one tiebreaker.\n\nIf two teams are still tied through those tiebreakers net points is the final tiebreaker.

Well that's assuming n is a natural number (1 or greater).\n\nFactor out n^2\n\nn^2 (2n^4 - n^2 - 1)\n\nThat in brackets can be factored like a quadratic trinomial. If you substitute (just for the bracket) n^2 as y, then you have 2y^2 - y -1, which is factorable into (y-1)(2y-1). substitute n^2 back in.\n\nso now you have n^2 (n^2 - 1)(2n^2 - 1). n^2 can also be stated as n(n)\n\nn^2-1 is a difference of perfect squares, because 1 is a square. It can be factored to (n+1)(n-1)\n\nnow you've got\n\nn(n-1)(n+1)(n)(2n^2 - 1)\n\nYour n(n-1)(n+1) is divisible by 6, because of the consecutive numbers rule. 3 consecutive numbers are always divisible by 3 and by 6 when multiplied. so we're gonna go ahead and leave that alone. Instead we're gonna do a strategy my teacher calls \"wishful thinking\". You want to make another difference of perfect squares within your 2nd bracket of (2n^2 - 1), so what you do is you change that 1 into (-2+3), which in theory IS one. now you have\n\n**n(n-1)(n+1)(n)**(n^2 - 2 + 3)\n\nWhat you're gonna do is, you're take the entirety of the part I bolded, and expand it partially. what you want to do is separate that difference of perfect squares. You're gonna multiply the bolded part into n^2 - 2, then into +3 respectively. \n\nyou have now got\n\nn(n-1)(n+1)(n)(2n^2 -2) + 3n(n)(n+1)(n-1)\n\nso BASICALLY, now you're gonna go ahead and factor 2n^2 - 2. Since it's basically a difference of perfect squares you're gonna get 2(n-1)(n+1). Now you want to rearrange the FUCK out of the first term. \n\nput that 2 at the front bc basically useless\n\n2**(n)(n-1)(n+1)**(n)(n-1)(n+1) \n\nis now your first term. now the first part (the bolded part) of it is from the original 3 consecutive integers. The 2nd part's single N is from when we split n^2 into 2 n's. the (n-1)(n+1) is from when we factored (n^2 - 2) just a bit back. So this is significant because we now have a pair of 3 consecutive integers, multiplied by 2. since 3 consecutive integers are factors of six, when you multiply them by anything you're gonna get another factor of 6. When you multiply 2 factors of 6 you're getting a factor of 36. so we are now completely fucking done with the 1st term. We're gonna call it 36k. Now we're gonna go ahead and attend to the 2nd term.\n\n36k + 3n(n)(n+1)(n-1)\n\nNow this is where we get into odd/even. We both know that integers can only be odd or even. So we're gonna list cases of what happens with the 2nd term is even or odd.\n\neven is easy. if n is even, that means it's at least 2. 3 x any even number is divisible by 6. Your list of 3 consecutive integers is also divisible by 6. 2 multiples of 6 multiplied by each other is divisible by 36. 2 multiples of 36 added is divisible by 36. Point proven. 36k + 36r is divisible by 36. \n\nIf it's odd it gets slightly trickier. if n is odd, that means that the two numbers around it are even. Those numbers being (n-1) and (n+1) Given we are working with natural numbers, when you multiply 2 even numbers it's a multiple of 4. It will all come out to becoming a multiple of 12, which is multiplied by a multiple of 3. 3x12 is 36, the 2nd term is divisible by 36.\n\n\nwhen you add 2 terms which are divisible by 36, you get another number divisible by 36.\n", "id": "dar1zfh"}, {"comment": "> [Instead we're gonna do a strategy my teacher calls \"wishful thinking\".](https://xkcd.com/1724/)\n\n", "id": "dar7f9o"}, {"comment": "loool it's just conforming the problem without changing the value of the numbers.", "id": "dar7jq1"}, {"comment": "I read most of this but you lost me in the last third.

I also believe Noel has stressed that he only wants to play the 5, so shipping him out is the best option IMO (since you'd get nothing in return for Jah).\n\nI propose: Noel, Bayless, and Hendo to the Nets for Brook Lopez and Justin Hamilton. Lopez is the perfect wing for the 76ers, as he is an ok facilitator for the SF position and is unafraid to shoot from the distance (in his last game, 8 of his 12 shots were from the 3). Although a player of Justin Hamilton's height (a paltry 6'11) would usually be a G/F for the Sixers, he gets slotted into the 4 here because every good team needs a white stretch 4. This would result in a lineup of:\n\nPG: Ben Simmons\n\nSG: Joel Embiid\n\nSF: Brook Lopez\n\nPF: Justin Hamilton\n\nC: Jahlil Okafor\n\nDario and Ersan can come off the bench to provide additional playmaking / 3pt shooting, respectively.\n\nTying up loose ends:\n\n* As the team now has sufficient PG depth (Simmons, Saric), it can afford to ship out Sergio Rodriguez to the Bulls for Robin Lopez. I have always maintained that the Bulls are one more mediocre 3pt-shooting guard away from greatness, and the Sixers gain a backup 7-footer in the process (hehe)\n\n* With so many shooters on the team, people are inevitably going to go cold. Thus, I propose a free agent signing of Greg Oden to have a big body keeping the bench extra warm to counteract this\n\n* Finally, with so many young guys on the team who will eventually demand the max, signing Yi Jianlian would bring in extra revenue from Chinese fans to prevent the organization from going under from the luxury tax", "id": "daqfimx"}, {"comment": "What did I just read", "id": "daqz62v"}, {"comment": "[monstars lineup.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNADtdRgYd0/maxresdefault.jpg)", "id": "daq12oj"}, {"comment": "Tried that lineup in 2k.

Great. \n\nPoint is, you can **feel** that Kobe is as good historically as MJ and lebron. Go ahead.

But Kobe's all around impact on the game is overstated by counting stats, and his peak stastical output was for a bad lakers team. The championships argument doesn't do a whole lot for me in general because of how variable the path to a championship is. But Kobe's 5 rings all took place with him surrounded by at least one other top 10 Nba player (the late 2000s run is debatable). \n\nThat doesn't invalidate him in any way, as lebron won majority of his rings so far with the heat. But it illustrates the type of luck and team building required to win a championship. Players don't win championships, teams do. If we're gonna take rings as the sole factor then it's bill Russell at the top. Kobe is in the tier just after MJ, LBJ, Kareem, Russell for me. \n\n**Edit: see stats below. Lebron has played a historically more important position than Kobe, and done essentially everything better according to advanced (read: better) statistics. Free throw shooting is his downfall, yet Kobe's TS is still lower.  Kobe had 0 seasons where he led the league in PER or BPM. Lebron led the league in PER 6 times and BPM 8 times. MJ led the league in PER 7 times and BPM 5 times. Other than \"ringz\" there is essentially no coherent and objective  argument to be made for Kobe Bryant as a better player over the course of his career than lebron James.

Durant was great, but things changed when steph left. Which is weird cause they rotate steph out and leave Kd in plenty.. steph was cold but down the stretch took over.

That pattern happened twice, but the Wolves pushed it to OT by tying the game on a ridiculous Wiggins 3 with a hand in his face leaving not enough time to respond on the Hornets end (Technically there was a chance to respond but we ran out a dreadful Kemba Walker isolation instead of the 1-5 PnR which is our best play).\n* Big difference for Frank from getting benched at the end of the Dallas game.\n* The big thing that closed the game for the Wolves was a pair of offensive rebounds where the accompanying Frank just didn't box out his man.  Frank's got to get better at that.\n* Well, the last time these two teams met, the game was predictably decided by the 3rd quarter, since the Hornets came in as the best 3rd quarter team in the league and the Wolves as the worst.  The Wolves have gotten better at 3rd quarters and the Hornets have gotten worse, but the 3rd quarter was still a differencemaker today just the same, giving the Hornets a double digit margin going into the 4th, which didn't prove to be enough ultimately.\n* The Hornets are not typically a team that blocks a lot of shots or steals the ball to run out in transition a lot.  We had 3 and 4 respectively in a fairly dominant 1st quarter despite being the team that goes into transition the 27th most often.\n* In fact, I'd argue that the reason we were ahead for large parts of this game in total, in spite of a lot of struggles shooting the ball in total and horrible lineup decisions re: Hawes/Hibbert, was that we did a very good job on defense, both of protecting the rim and contesting 3's.\n* As much as can be said about MKG's defense being full-scale back, and how he's scoring again, the thing I've been most impressed with in these past few games has been the recovery of his passing ability -- basically, realizing when a drive has gone sour, but also realizing that he's drawn a man so that someone's open.  Today he found Cody early for an easy shot.\n* Nic Batum deserves credit for his defense tonight.  Having compared him unfavorably to C.J. McCollum, games like tonight are important because even if his shot isn't there, he's still the same Nic who makes a huge positive impact in all sorts of ways outside of it.  Though he also got made to look silly on a miscommunication late in the game that closed the gap to 4 on a free Lavine layup.\n* This is twice this season that Frank's played well against the Timberwolves, and they didn't even try to guard him with Adreian Paine this time to trigger it.  He still wasn't perfect -- took a bad step-back baseline long 2, and missed a wide open 3 or two, but it was a welcome return to form over how awful he's been over the past few games, especially with Marvin out for at least 1 more.\n* I'm curious if Hibbert shoots 3s next year.  He's got the midrange, and that seems to be the skill that other large, relatively immobile bigs have picked up -- Brook Lopez and Marc Gasol chief among them.\n* There was a play around 8:30 left in the 2nd quarter that demonstrated just how stupidly athletic Zach Lavine is.  He got isolated on Jeremy Lamb at the top of the arc, started moving forward, and at one point just exploded past him by about 3 feet in a single step.  And this is past a pretty athletic defender too.  It was one of those plays where it lead to absolutely nothing (I think Bjelica hit a shot at the end of the possession, but well after the move), but still left me trying to figure out what had just happened.\n* The regularity with which Ramon Sessions goes 1 for 2 is both frustrating and terrifying.  He split his first pair tonight like clockwork\n* It's been regularly hard to separate our poor late game execution from poor refereeing, and this game (Like the Pelicans, Knicks, and Spurs games before it) was no exception.  Marco got tackled on a 3 to no call, KAT bodied Kemba, Lavine tackled Frank.  Overall the referees created a 12 point swing in the final 10 minutes of this game, and while we should've executed better along the way, it's extremely hard to separate what's awful refereeing from what's actual bad play so as to know how to fix it for the future.\n* Hibbert's baby-hook was much harder than usual today.  Like he just threw a few absolute bricks on that hook today rather than the soft touch you're supposed to have.\n* The Hibbert/Hawes pairing was terrible in general today, and cost us the lead in both the 2nd and 4th quarters.  And yet, they received more minutes than Frank and Cody respectively in the first half.  Hawes got 15 minutes to Frank's 9, and Hibbert and Cody split at 12 each.\n* At this point, it is absolutely imperative that Cody plays 30 minutes a night.  The other 66 big minutes can be distributed based on who's playing well, but that does mean you actually have to give the minutes to the guy who's playing well and bench the guy who's playing poorly.  While Frank got okay minutes, he needed to take a lot more of the minutes that Hawes was so bad in.\n* Big man +/-:  Cody and Frank +10, Hibbert and Hawes each -15.  5 point loss.\n\nOverall, we let another team that we should be much better than hang around just enough to make a game for it.  It's not good, and we need to break that habit, and it finally cost us.

That pattern happened twice, but the Wolves pushed it to OT by tying the game on a ridiculous Wiggins 3 with a hand in his face leaving not enough time to respond on the Hornets end (Technically there was a chance to respond but we ran out a dreadful Kemba Walker isolation instead of the 1-5 PnR which is our best play).\n* Big difference for Frank from getting benched at the end of the Dallas game.\n* The big thing that closed the game for the Wolves was a pair of offensive rebounds where the accompanying Frank just didn't box out his man.  Frank's got to get better at that.\n* Well, the last time these two teams met, the game was predictably decided by the 3rd quarter, since the Hornets came in as the best 3rd quarter team in the league and the Wolves as the worst.  The Wolves have gotten better at 3rd quarters and the Hornets have gotten worse, but the 3rd quarter was still a differencemaker today just the same, giving the Hornets a double digit margin going into the 4th, which didn't prove to be enough ultimately.\n* The Hornets are not typically a team that blocks a lot of shots or steals the ball to run out in transition a lot.  We had 3 and 4 respectively in a fairly dominant 1st quarter despite being the team that goes into transition the 27th most often.\n* In fact, I'd argue that the reason we were ahead for large parts of this game in total, in spite of a lot of struggles shooting the ball in total and horrible lineup decisions re: Hawes/Hibbert, was that we did a very good job on defense, both of protecting the rim and contesting 3's.\n* As much as can be said about MKG's defense being full-scale back, and how he's scoring again, the thing I've been most impressed with in these past few games has been the recovery of his passing ability -- basically, realizing when a drive has gone sour, but also realizing that he's drawn a man so that someone's open.  Today he found Cody early for an easy shot.\n* Nic Batum deserves credit for his defense tonight.  Having compared him unfavorably to C.J. McCollum, games like tonight are important because even if his shot isn't there, he's still the same Nic who makes a huge positive impact in all sorts of ways outside of it.  Though he also got made to look silly on a miscommunication late in the game that closed the gap to 4 on a free Lavine layup.\n* This is twice this season that Frank's played well against the Timberwolves, and they didn't even try to guard him with Adreian Paine this time to trigger it.  He still wasn't perfect -- took a bad step-back baseline long 2, and missed a wide open 3 or two, but it was a welcome return to form over how awful he's been over the past few games, especially with Marvin out for at least 1 more.\n* I'm curious if Hibbert shoots 3s next year.  He's got the midrange, and that seems to be the skill that other large, relatively immobile bigs have picked up -- Brook Lopez and Marc Gasol chief among them.\n* There was a play around 8:30 left in the 2nd quarter that demonstrated just how stupidly athletic Zach Lavine is.  He got isolated on Jeremy Lamb at the top of the arc, started moving forward, and at one point just exploded past him by about 3 feet in a single step.  And this is past a pretty athletic defender too.  It was one of those plays where it lead to absolutely nothing (I think Bjelica hit a shot at the end of the possession, but well after the move), but still left me trying to figure out what had just happened.\n* The regularity with which Ramon Sessions goes 1 for 2 is both frustrating and terrifying.  He split his first pair tonight like clockwork\n* It's been regularly hard to separate our poor late game execution from poor refereeing, and this game (Like the Pelicans, Knicks, and Spurs games before it) was no exception.  Marco got tackled on a 3 to no call, KAT bodied Kemba, Lavine tackled Frank.  Overall the referees created a 12 point swing in the final 10 minutes of this game, and while we should've executed better along the way, it's extremely hard to separate what's awful refereeing from what's actual bad play so as to know how to fix it for the future.\n* Hibbert's baby-hook was much harder than usual today.  Like he just threw a few absolute bricks on that hook today rather than the soft touch you're supposed to have.\n* The Hibbert/Hawes pairing was terrible in general today, and cost us the lead in both the 2nd and 4th quarters.  And yet, they received more minutes than Frank and Cody respectively in the first half.  Hawes got 15 minutes to Frank's 9, and Hibbert and Cody split at 12 each.\n* At this point, it is absolutely imperative that Cody plays 30 minutes a night.  The other 66 big minutes can be distributed based on who's playing well, but that does mean you actually have to give the minutes to the guy who's playing well and bench the guy who's playing poorly.  While Frank got okay minutes, he needed to take a lot more of the minutes that Hawes was so bad in.\n* Big man +/-:  Cody and Frank +10, Hibbert and Hawes each -15.  5 point loss.\n\nOverall, we let another team that we should be much better than hang around just enough to make a game for it.  It's not good, and we need to break that habit, and it finally cost us.

I'm making the point that, in what have seemed like chokes for the Hornets, there's been a lot of awful refereeing creating large point swings, which makes it difficult to tell what exactly is the problem.

Anyway, it was a complicated decision that was probably the result of all of the following factors, right?\n\n* Didn't want to amnesty Perkins\n* Didn't want to pay the luxury tax--and misread the tea leaves about the coming salary cap jump\n* Concern about Harden's fit with KD and RWB\n* Underestimated Harden's potential, partly because of recency bias after his lackluster performance in the Finals\n* Overconfidence in their ability to draft and develop players at a level comparable to what they thought at the time Harden would ultimately become\n\nThe first two are really the only unforgivable missteps, imo.

I kept saying it the last two years and hated it. \n\nThen rumors kept coming up about trading him and everything, and again it wasn't going to happen because of the circumstances in which he was brought on the team and what he represented.\n\nThis happened under Thibs as well. It's not on the coach. The FO is bad, plain and simple (before people try to mock NY, I followed the Bulls the entire time Rose was there and now NYK are my favorite team due to having 2 of my most liked players on the same team) \n\nAs long as that FO has any significant say in the structure and play of the team, at least in a way that gets in the way of the *good* coaches, then the only way Bulls get a championship is if they are handed one...and I HATE that because Jimmy and Taj deserve so much better. ", "id": "dar6brk"}, {"comment": "I agree with you, but thibs would at least sit pau in the fourth just like he did for boozer. It got to the point where pau even complained about it publicly to the media. I think it's absolutely absurd that a team would sacrifice anything in order to make a professional player feel better about themselves or to placate someone's ego. I know it eventually falls down to the FO and the awful choices they have continued to make. Even this year, having rondo on the team is just pretty much pointless. Can we be a true contender with him as our primary pg? No. Is he our point for the future and going forward? No. So why are we giving him a ton of minutes? It'd be much better to give the minutes to some young guys and see if they can develop.", "id": "darlls1"}], [{"comment": "#MakeTheBullsGreatAgain", "id": "daq0gr7"}], [{"comment": "r/nbaww", "id": "daq1hwq"}]]], "5g7ec9": ["GAME THREAD: Houston Rockets @ Denver Nuggets | Dec 2, 2016", "2016-12-03 05:30:03", 32, "https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/5g7ec9/game_thread_houston_rockets_denver_nuggets_dec_2/", [[2, "wheres the post game thread?"], [4, "GG Denver we just rollin right now.

Honest question ", "id": "daqjvj6"}, {"comment": "Depends on what happens to Thunder. If Westbrook led OKC to a title I think you could right then say Durant isn't getting his jersey retired. I don't think OKC would want to bestow the highest honor to both the guy who brought them a title, and the guy who ditched the guy who brought the title.\n\nNow some people would argue it depends on what Durant does as well. Personally, I don't think it makes a big difference. Assuming everything I say is factually true (I do this anyways) we've already established Durant isn't getting his jersey retired if OKC wins a championship with Westbrook. So what if OKC comes close but never gets a title, and GS does the same? I think both parties are gonna be looking to relive the glory days. KD's like, \"baby, I'm sorry I never should have left.\" and OKC is thinking, \"We really were at our best with him.\" This would be like having a lot of fond memories of an uncle everyone loved who got drunk at a 4th of July party and groped his sister-in-law. Like yeah you hate him for a bit, but after thing settle down and emotions heal, you see he's not doing so well so you figure, \"What the hell, let's extend an olive branch and help the guy out.\"\n\nSo, let's say Durant doesn't win one in GS and Thunder never seriously compete. Then I think his jersey retirement chances in OKC are very good. OKC especially here would want to do so. This team doesn't have a lot of history being new, so they would retire Durant's jersey, one of the two best players, a superstar and MVP for the team. Young franchises don't get these guys all the time, they'd want to honor him since they fell apart after he left. They don't want to look like total jokes. Honor the team that came so close so many times and is one the the biggest what ifs ever. This is kind of like falling on tough times yourself. You're homeless and are gonna be more likely to hang out with your weird uncle. You're gonna start groping people too.\n\nSo finally on to the Durant winning titles scenarios. If OKC is trash, I think they retire GS legend Durant's jersey still. Magic did it with Shaq, and I think a team like OKC is very similar to Magic. Discounting all the Sonics history, Durant+Westbrook is the best and really only thing the Thunder would have to their history, to a larger extent than the Magic having 4 years of Shaq which was enough for them. Now the circumstances are different, Magic fucked up low balling Shaq, whereas KD just left. That could play a part in it, but personally I don't think so. In both Thunder suck scenarios, I think they're gonna want to grab what they feels is theirs with KD. they want people to remember, \"hey, this all time great played for the Thunder!\" This is like you going homeless and all of a sudden your weird uncle became the star SF for the GS Warriors and now you're the OKC Thunder. \"Oh hey uncle, remember all the good times we had? Can I tell girls that I know you?\"\n\nLast scenario! KD wins titles while Thunder compete. This one is spicy! If GS is winning while the Thunder keep coming oh so close, they're really gonna hate KD. Especially if GS is the ones knocking them out some years. This isn't like your uncle in the past groping someone. This is like your uncle killing a cop. Also, that cop was your dad. No olive branch will be extended.\n\n**TL; DR**\n\nThunder Championship = No KD retirement.\n\nThunder good + No GS title = KD retirement (iffiest one to me).\n\nThunder suck + No GS title = KD retirement.\n\nThunder good + GS title(s) = No KD retirement.\n\nThunder suck + GS titles(s) = KD retirement.", "id": "daqn56z"}, {"comment": "If we suck and they win a lot, I don't think we're retiring his jersey ", "id": "dar9c1p"}, {"comment": "I wouldn't be surprised.

Led the team in points and minutes.\n\nIn recent games (including last night), B.I.'s been more aggressive lately: attacking the hole, drawing/absorbing contact, keeping the dribble alive, and reacting to the defense (instead of going with a pre-determined play). Most notably, his playmaking duties have increased with injuries and he's acquitted himself quite well. He's already making one wonder whether he should start over Deng. I didn't think we'd be considering this question until around the all-star break.\n\n[**After re-watching his shot attempts against Toronto**](http://stats.nba.com/events/#!/?flag=3&CFID=&CFPARAMS=&PlayerID=1627742&TeamID=1610612747&GameID=0021600284&ContextMeasure=FGA&Season=2016-17&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&RangeType=0&StartPeriod=1&EndPeriod=10&StartRange=0&EndRange=28800&section=game&sct=plot), I was left more encouraged / happy. Notable possessions are bolded/linked.\n\n* 1st shot: Ingram made a transition layup. Nothing notable to highlight.\n* 2nd shot: Ingram missed from corner three. Nothing notable to highlight except he missed long (as he usually does on threes).\n* 3rd shot: Ingram missed a driving floater. It was a fairly difficult shot as B.I. drove into traffic, but he had a pretty good look thanks to his size / agility. Even though he missed, his penetration allowed Black to get the tip-in basket.\n* **4th shot: Ingram missed a pullup jumper. Ingram ran a P&R with Tarik Black and then put DeRozan in jail \\(a la D\u2019Angelo with the hip\\), but just couldn't hit the shot. It was a good look / attempt though.**\n* 5th shot: Ingram hits a corner three. Nothing notable to highlight.\n* **6th shot: Ingram hits a driving layup. BI attacked Ross off the dribble, and used his superior length to snake around BeBe [7 ft tall, which you cannot teach] for the basket. Great move.**\n* 7th shot: Ingram cuts to the basket for an open dunk after Ross fell asleep on him.\n* 8th shot: Ingram misses an above-the-break three. He was in a rush since the shotclock was about to run out, but he had a great look. He was just a bit strong though and the shot hit the back of the rim.\n* 9th shot: Ingram misses a straightaway three. Nothing notable to highlight.\n* **10th shot: Ingram hits a driving layup. He attacked DeRozan off the dribble, and used his length to glide past Valanciunas and Siakam for the basket. Really impressive.**\n* 11th shot: Ingram misses a corner three. Misses long again.\n* **12th shot: Ingram hits a turnaround fadeaway jumper. Ingram posts up and backs Powell down, Powell doesn't give up much ground, but doesn't matter as Ingram shoots over him anyway.**\n* **13th shot: Ingram hits a running jumper. In semi-transition, BeBe meets Ingram at the top of the arc. Ingram attacks the rim immediately, absorbs contact from BeBe, and hits the shot.**\n* 14th shot: Ingram misses a reverse layup. Ingram goes baseline and tries to go around BeBe using his length. This would probably be a 'bad shot' for most players, but Ingram slithered around BeBe and nearly made the basket thanks to his never-ending arms.\n* 15th-16th shots: Ingram attacks BeBe in isolation, gets to the hoop, draws contact, but can't finish the bucket. Luckily, he's able to get the tip-in almost immediately.", "id": "daqzsv3"}, {"comment": "Yep, I mentioned this in /r/lakers last night ... im really liking how much more aggressive Brandon Ingram is getting over the past few games.

Seems like more people are saying marijuana is the better choice over vicodin because the side effects are not nearly as dangerous.\n\nThere will always be a place for opiates but there is a very good argument of prescribing marijuana in place of them in a lot of cases.\n\nNo idea why you got so defensive at the end.

That they did not go to the three ball that often, but c'mon you see how they have been this season. The issue is they are a streaky 3 pt. team. And JR was been cold to boot. When they are all clicking it's a very well oiled machine as has been witnessed. And when Lebron wants to turn on the jets he can, but so far this season he has not. Deep down I think he is just trying to train this team to win on its own. I mean, when was Lebron's last breakout game? I would say the finals months ago. Since then both Kyrie and Love are having legacy games, but Lebron has been silent. Last season people saw this which gave birth to the LeDecline meme. This season is different so far because not too long ago we saw the Cavs flourish when it really counted.\n\nThis seriously a great time to be into the NBA. Lebron has built quite the legacy to stand up on and has been to 6 straight NBA finals winning 3. Meanwhile, you have the Warriors. Seriously the best team in modern history, and possibly of all-time with newly added Kevin Durant. A great narrative in its own. Then factor all the other teams in the NBA vying for the spotlight and desire to conquer the Cavs or Warriors. So many good young talented players. Sorry for the tangential ramblings.
