And it's been pointed out that *the majority do not matter*.  But that is only partially correct as well.\n\nThe truth is that *any* minority is judged not by its \"best and brightest\", but by those among them who are most offensive and criminal.  The *only* way the minority can protect themselves from the consequences of this judgment is to aggressively condemn those who are offensive and criminal.\n\nThis means to *very specifically* reject their individual bad behavior, identifying them as bad individuals, and to quickly turn them over to the majority authorities for punishment, effectively exiling them from their community.\n\nSome minorities do not do this, which creates prejudices against them by the majority.  Which, if you think of it, is not entirely unfair.\n\nSo how do Muslims, as a community, fail?\n\n1)  They refuse to specifically condemn the actions of an individual, *as such*, instead only condemning \"all\" such actions by anyone.  This especially grates when they are asked to condemn a specific terrorist act carried out by Muslims, but instead condemn \"all terrorism\".  This is weaselly, because their *definition* of terrorism is not the same as ours.\n\n2)  Their definition of \"victim\" is also not the same as ours.  And this gets rather sordid.  They will quickly pull the victim card for any Muslim, no matter how repugnant their behavior; but infidels, non Muslims, are rarely or never described as \"victims\", because there is no recognition of human rights, as such, in Islam or Sharia law.  And those *hated* by Muslims, such as Jewish women and children, cannot be seen as victims, because they \"oppress\" and \"victimize\" Muslims by being alive, so are legitimate targets for attack.\n\n3)  They refuse to call any Muslim a \"bad Muslim\".  Nor will they ever blame doctrinal Islam, though it is cited by Muslims in carrying out their actions.  They will often call captured terrorists \"mentally ill\", even though they planned and executed detailed plans; which is solely done because there is no social sanction against the mentally ill in Islam, and such claims are cynically used to evade punishment by the authorities.\n\n4)  The icing on the cake is well documented.  It is the collective behavior of Muslims living in countries, whose behavior is entirely dictated by what percent of Muslims are in the population.  In short, in stages, the greater percentage of Muslims, the worse their behavior, becoming increasingly oppressive, demanding and abusive to non-Muslims.", "id": "dakgo7u"}, {"comment": "Sure, fine, I can actually agree with your logic.

When 9-11 happened, that were pictures of \"peaceful, moderate\" Muslims from around the world *celebrating*.\n\nEarly on in Afghanistan and Iraq, the US faced a dilemma.  The most dangerous and threatening Muslims in the world were dispersed around the globe, and usually indistinguishable from non-violent Muslims.  So how could we concentrate them at a place to fight our soldiers, instead of them coming west and carrying out terrorism against our civilians?\n\nThe proposed solution was brilliant, called \"the roach motel\".  To permit or even encourage fighters from around the world to come to Afghanistan and Iraq, where they could be dealt with, as well as culling the Muslim herd of its most dangerous and violent members.\n\nAfghanistan itself is a natural death trap.  To get to Iraq we chose Fallujah as their destination, allowing it to be captured and turned into a headquarters for them.  But to get there, typically from Syria, they had to pass by US bases, some of which were surrounded by 5km deep kill zones.  This culled the stupidest of them.  Then the second battle of Fallujah killed outright 1,500 of them and captured an equal number.\n\nIn any event, the US has gone out of its way to separate and kill the worst of Muslims.

Academically, it's seen that sex is what you have downstairs and gender is what role you play in society. Man and Woman are two genders that you can identify with because you feel like you want to fulfill a roll in society that is either more masculine or more feminine. Or you just don't identify with either and see yourself as a mix of the two - in which case you are outside of the \"gender binary\" (I.e. Wanting to call yourself a man and a woman).\n\nSex is biological, gender is psychological.\n\nClassically, the idea was that your role in society is tied to your sex. Therefore, females are women and males are men. **If you need to know anything about the argument, it's this:** the idea is just that males don't have have to play a masculine role if they don't want to and females don't have to play a feminine role if they don't want to. I feel like this is kind of a \"no duh\" thing in our society now. Even most conservatives (that I know) dissent from the idea that males and females have to act a certain way. Our society generally accepts the idea that people should do whatever they want to be happy as long as it doesn't hurt others.\n\nYou still may disagree that gender and sex are separate entities, but that doesn't really change the fact that this is accepted in academia. I think the biggest issue with this argument is that **nobody fucking explains it to people who don't understand.** I think what sucks is that the initial reaction on the part of people that are pushing for a separation in the definition of sex and gender in society is that they already see it as something that *should* be accepted and that it *is* accepted and so they just get angry without educating anybody on what they believe. It may be a bit petty, but it just seems delusional to somebody who has never heard the concept before. My theory is that, typically, feminists tend to keep to their own circle of friends with similar ideologies just as anybody else does and that sample size reinforces the idea that they're beliefs are socially recognized. This is a problem because I see many of my own friends getting angry or offended on the part of the marginalized community they say they are allies to without explaining why they are offended or angry. This just alienates people who would otherwise *at least* be sympathetic to the issue.\n\n**tl;dr** Nobody can blame you for being frustrated about this but the idea is that gender and sex are two different things.
