Since the Switch will have handheld capabilities, I think it's likely that at least the next generation will be on the Switch. \n\nI doubt this so-called \"Stars\" will be on the Switch, though. First of all, nothing is stopping them from pulling another B2W2. Secondly, games in the same gen being on different platforms could cause connectivity, accessibility, and general practicality issues, which I believe were the main reasons B2W2 was on the DS as well.\n\nI doubt we're getting a third version at all.

I do think the Eurogamer stuff is just a rumor and should be treated as such, but so were the leaked Gen 7 starters...\n\nEither way, it does look like the 3DS may be replaced by the Switch in the future and if that is the case, Pokemon would likely move to the Switch. And while we haven't seen a 3rd game in a long time, if they were to make a Pokemon game for the Switch I think it makes sense to bring it back since it would be a slightly revised port to give more incentive to buy it; I can't see them just porting Sun and Moon over without changes. Also, Gen 7 is still too new for Gen 8 to be a thing anytime soon, but perhaps there won't be any Switch Pokemon games until then.\n\nI would expect there to be some new Pokemon game next year, like how OR/AS was the year after X/Y; same for B/W to B2/W2. So it would line up for a third Gen 7 game on the Switch towards the fall if it released earlier that year. As for the whole \"Pocket Monster\" thing, I don't think that has mattered for a long time. The modern systems are kinda big and aren't really pocket sized anymore. I mean, have you tried putting a 2DS in a pocket? Even a New 3DS XL is kinda bulky compared to the older handhelds. I'd say Pokemon being on the handhelds is more about portability and being able to take the game with you to battle people and trade, and the Switch is a portable console.

As a big Gen V fan, this was quite a treat, and after all these three snippets I'm glad to have finally see a somewhat faithful animated take on Unova, alongside the B2W2 animated trailer.\n\nMy one gripe with the episode is that Ghetsis' breakdown doesn't work quite as well when it's *before* Kyurem gets defeated even if it's verbatim from the game, and would've liked to see it happen after Hilbert made quick work of White Kyurem using Zekrom, though I understand that for pacing it would've been pretty bad to do that, and it's only a minor gripe overall, not enough to ruin the episode.\n\nNext up are the Kalos snippets, and I'm curious about what they plan to cover: aside from AZ's backstory there's not much from X and Y that the Anime didn't enhance or portray rather well, so I am interested to see what they might plan to do, even if the short runtime likely won't allow them to do better than XY did."], [6, "RESHIRAM YOURE SO BEAUTIFUL"], [4, "Ooo...

I'm into it. On one hand, an incident 10 years ago across the ocean isn't exactly small talk for NPCs to make, but on the other hand, you'd think someone like Burnet or Wicke or someone would discuss an incident like that if it happened in universe B, as part of telling the player about the threat of the UBs. Basically, more evidence here than some other Pokemon theories, haha.\n\nThis reminds me of something from ORAS that's been bugging me, actually...Looker washed up on a beach himself in that game, at the Battle Resort. As far as I can remember, the game never explained why this happened, although I originally thought Hoopa might contain an event related to it. Do you think there's a possibility it's connected to this at all? Is anyone ever gonna explain why that event was in the game besides to give you an item, or was there already something I missed?"], [7, "There's really no reason to assume that Z-Moves are exclusive to Universe B. It's never said to be the case, and in fact, it is implied in the post-game that their power is derived from the energy that comes from the wormholes (just like the aura of Totem Pok\u00e9mon), and if Universe A is seeing Ultra Beasts, then that means they have wormholes, which means that they have Z-Moves. We also know that the kahunas and the tapu were able to at least stave off the Beasts during the recent invasion, and they probably would have done so using only their Z-Power. So Universe B isn't totally helpless.\n\nI also doubt that the International Police are outright *eradicating* the Beasts with just Mega Evolutions and Z-Moves. Consider the UB team from ten years ago - Looker really doesn't seem the type to be able to harness Mega Evolution or Z-Power, Nanu wasn't a kahuna yet, and that leaves their Faller partner, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, considering she was an amnesiac from Universe A, she hadn't gone through the island challenge (so no Z-Ring), and isn't likely to have significant prowess with Mega Evolution, either. So I think they're probably handling the UBs with actual weaponry - although one could make the point that Universe B is more technologically advanced due to the presence of Infinity Energy.\n\n> Consider the pokedex entries regarding the UBs and you'll find that they're capable of quite apocalyptic behaviors. Yet, no common person seems to show any sign of being aware of these incidents despite their scale (collapsing entire buildings, smashing cars, raiding power plants, controlling people, and even devouring entire oceans)- implying they never happened. So how does the pokedex know of these incidents?\n\nHow would a Pok\u00e9dex that was built in Universe B know of information from another universe, though?\n\nThe way the Pok\u00e9dex words the entries for the UBs, they sound like witness reports, and I don't have a hard time thinking that they're meant to be recent. The lack of visible carnage in the game is probably just your usual gameplay/storyline dissonance.\n\nAlso, just as a note - there was probably a Universe B Battle Frontier built in the time between ORAS and SM. It's a gap of probably more than ten years, and the Battle Frontier construction project had begun by the end of ORAS. And considering the presence of both Pok\u00e9mon themselves and Infinity Energy, I doubt it would take a very long time to complete. But that's not to say that the Interpol Anabel *isn't* from Universe A. I definitely think *that's* what they were getting at.

They are essentially just very powerful Pok\u00e9mon, and the backstory outright states that a team of three humans and their Pok\u00e9mon were enough to defeat Guzzlord, who is potentially the most dangerous.\n\nAlso, there's probably more than two universes - I imagine we're up to at least seven universes by now.

It's never said to be the case, and in fact, it is implied in the post-game that their power is derived from the energy that comes from the wormholes (just like the aura of Totem Pok\u00e9mon), and if Universe A is seeing Ultra Beasts, then that means they have wormholes, which means that they have Z-Moves. We also know that the kahunas and the tapu were able to at least stave off the Beasts during the recent invasion, and they probably would have done so using only their Z-Power. So Universe B isn't totally helpless.\n\nI also doubt that the International Police are outright *eradicating* the Beasts with just Mega Evolutions and Z-Moves. Consider the UB team from ten years ago - Looker really doesn't seem the type to be able to harness Mega Evolution or Z-Power, Nanu wasn't a kahuna yet, and that leaves their Faller partner, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, considering she was an amnesiac from Universe A, she hadn't gone through the island challenge (so no Z-Ring), and isn't likely to have significant prowess with Mega Evolution, either. So I think they're probably handling the UBs with actual weaponry - although one could make the point that Universe B is more technologically advanced due to the presence of Infinity Energy.\n\n> Consider the pokedex entries regarding the UBs and you'll find that they're capable of quite apocalyptic behaviors. Yet, no common person seems to show any sign of being aware of these incidents despite their scale (collapsing entire buildings, smashing cars, raiding power plants, controlling people, and even devouring entire oceans)- implying they never happened. So how does the pokedex know of these incidents?\n\nHow would a Pok\u00e9dex that was built in Universe B know of information from another universe, though?\n\nThe way the Pok\u00e9dex words the entries for the UBs, they sound like witness reports, and I don't have a hard time thinking that they're meant to be recent. The lack of visible carnage in the game is probably just your usual gameplay/storyline dissonance.\n\nAlso, just as a note - there was probably a Universe B Battle Frontier built in the time between ORAS and SM. It's a gap of probably more than ten years, and the Battle Frontier construction project had begun by the end of ORAS. And considering the presence of both Pok\u00e9mon themselves and Infinity Energy, I doubt it would take a very long time to complete. But that's not to say that the Interpol Anabel *isn't* from Universe A. I definitely think *that's* what they were getting at.

So I wouldn't be surprised if, say, even though Infinity Energy was only proven to exist in universe B, all Pokedexes in all universes have Infinity Energy inside them somehow - connecting every Pokedex, even between other dimensions.\n\nPerhaps the Pokedex was invented in a *completely* different dimension - then somehow got its duplicates to other dimensions like A and B - before being cloned and mass produced.

How could/why would it have been distributed across multiple universes in that timespan? \"Somehow\" isn't really a satisfying answer for something that so hugely changes our understanding of how the Pok\u00e9mon world works.\n- Infinity Energy is the life energy harvested from Pok\u00e9mon. Mr. Stone outright says that many would find its use reprehensible, but his grandfather was just crazy enough to give it a shot anyway. Oak seems like a kind fellow with a love of Pok\u00e9mon (he was a Trainer himself, once), so I have a hard time picturing him being comfortable with using Infinity Energy in the construction of his device.\n- As far as we know, Infinity Energy isn't like, quantum entangled across universes and doesn't have the capacity to do what you suggest. At most, it's been said to be able to open up a wormhole between universes, but that also required a special Link Cable, several shards of energized meteorites, and a Key Stone (something else that would be exclusive to Universe B).\n\nAnything's possible in theory, sure, but just from a critical point of view, what you're proposing would necessitate a significant and, frankly, convoluted rewrite concerning one of the series's most fundamental elements (the Pok\u00e9dex).

Some hit harder or are faster, and some are bulkier, hit harder, and are faster too. If it got something that buffed its speed and attack and a little to the defenses, it could be quite good. \n\nLapras already has a pretty high BST, that's well-balanced, so it could become quite the overpowering tank with just a little more stat boosting. \n\nAnd Tauros is already pretty darn good, but it does have a lot of competiton with the bouffalants and zangooses of the world, so an evo would definitely help its case. \n\nOh yeah, Hypno as well, on a personal level.

It would also serve as an Archer archetype, which we don't have much of in Smash outside of one of Link/Toon Link's moves (EDIT: Somehow forgot Pit and Dark Pit, though they still play differently compared to traditional archers. I'm picturing something like Archer Kirby from Kirby Fighters with some Grass and trapping moves mixed in). It seems to be popular enough to get in, and Ash owns a Rowlet in the anime, so it may have the most exposure of the the starters going by past trends.\n\n* Mimikyu could be a fun character. I could see it trying to imitate Pikachu's standard moves (while putting its own twist on them. It's specials would be entirely unique), and Disguise could be built into an interesting character gimmick (which is becoming increasingly important to being a Smash character).\n\n* UB-01 is probably the least likely choice of the three, but if Ultra Beasts become a large part of the franchise in the future I think it would make sense to see them represented. Most characters in Smash represent something about their franchise. Whether it be a character archetype, gameplay mechanic, or a specific game they all mean something to the series they represent. It also has access to a lot of moves that I'd love to see translated into Smash (like Venoshock, Toxic Spikes, Psywave). It could be a very unique character.\n\nI haven't put much thought into stages or music, but the ones you mention could all work well.\n\nPokeBall Pokemon also have a lot of potential this time around. Dhelmise trapping opponents, Bruxish stopping a character from having move priority, Wishiwashi using weak attacks until provoked, there are lots of options."], [3, "Most obvious for playable to me seems to be Tapu Koko.

Exeggutor Island would be fun. Alolan Exeggutor in the background that decide to Dragon Hammer the battlefield. Pelipper that laze by to act as platforms and occasionally spit up items. Team Skull Grunts in the background that randomly pose, and seldomly toss a ball with a Wimpod to scuttle back and forth, acting like Starfy."], [2, "I think Decidueye, Inceneroar, and Mimikyu are the most likely characters, due to their popularity and their attractive designs. \nStage wise, Poni Canyon would be cool, or maybe something related to the first island.

Decidueye's Spirit Shackle would be a set of arrows that would temporarily immobilize anyone they hit. Incineroar's Darkest Lariat would just be it spinning horizontally across the stage and blowing back anything it its way.

For Master Balls, we could have Solgaleo/Lunala with their signature moves, Magearna could use Fleur Cannon or Synchronoise, and Marshadow with Spectral Thief. For music, I would put the Elite Four theme, Island Kahuna theme (maybe?), Gladion's encounter or battle theme, Vast Poni Canyon theme, Aether Foundation or Paradise theme or a remix (if there were a story mode that had a factory-like thing), the Guardian Deity battle theme, and the League Title Defense music.

It seems to be popular enough to get in, and Ash owns a Rowlet in the anime, so it may have the most exposure of the the starters going by past trends.\n\n* Mimikyu could be a fun character. I could see it trying to imitate Pikachu's standard moves (while putting its own twist on them. It's specials would be entirely unique), and Disguise could be built into an interesting character gimmick (which is becoming increasingly important to being a Smash character).\n\n* UB-01 is probably the least likely choice of the three, but if Ultra Beasts become a large part of the franchise in the future I think it would make sense to see them represented. Most characters in Smash represent something about their franchise. Whether it be a character archetype, gameplay mechanic, or a specific game they all mean something to the series they represent. It also has access to a lot of moves that I'd love to see translated into Smash (like Venoshock, Toxic Spikes, Psywave). It could be a very unique character.\n\nI haven't put much thought into stages or music, but the ones you mention could all work well.\n\nPokeBall Pokemon also have a lot of potential this time around.

The clothing options are already limited and in an ideal game you'd be able to choose if you even change clothes or what those clothes are. \n\nAnd the music, well... people have brought up before that bike-riding already did that, and that's always been an issue for some. \n\nThe designers probably felt that different themes suited different situations but they obviously can't please everyone all of the time. \n\nAgain, realistically you can put on whatever music you like when you're driving or walking or whatever if you have a stereo or portable device, and it would be nice to have options built-in for everyone's preferences... whether or not to even have different music or to be able to choose your own tracks. \n\nThe simple fact is the games are already big and complicated enough without adding tons more options to make every last detail customizable. But we're slowly heading in that direction... \n\nRemember, these are relatively small games in terms of how much data and design go into them and they are basically for kids. I know a ton of us are adults and want a fully-fledged real-life Pokemon simulation to live in, but ya... despite all the flaws, give the games some credit and enjoy them for what they are.", "id": "dar4ttu"}, {"comment": "I'd say nothing, but Game Freak will have to dance a little bit to keep the mechanic for subsequent games, because they're billed as something special about Alola.\n\n\n\nMultiple NPCs from other regions talk about HMs, so we know the HM system is still in place elsewhere.

", "id": "darenh8"}, {"comment": "> A GF guy said the remakes replace the current games in the timeline.\n\nI'd be interested in reading this quote if you can find it.\n\nBecause there's plenty of clear evidence for the games existing in a multiverse.\n\nWhile it is true that FRLG and HGSS can probably be presumed to replace their predecessors due to the links to RSE and DPP, respectively, that were inserted into the remakes (as well as later games' references to remake-specific features like the Pok\u00e9athlon), ORAS took a distinctly different direction. In the Delta Episode, Zinnia reveals the presence of another universe, exactly like the Hoenn in ORAS, except it is less technologically advanced, and never saw the outbreak of the Kalos war or the creation of the ultimate weapon. This sounds rather like the world of RSE, which notably lack several of the features of ORAS's world that rely on Infinity Energy (which was derived from the knowledge of the ultimate weapon). There's no Sea Mauville in RSE, which could be the case because Sea Mauville was only built after Mr. Stone's grandfather was inspired to develop Infinity Energy. In RSE, Team Aqua/Magma don't affix an Infinity Energy-powered drill to their submarine. Nor do their goals for the Meteorite revolve around the creation of a Mega Stone - instead, RSE Archie/Maxie only intend to use the Meteorite to alter the function of the volcano. And on top of all of that, there's no sacred tree in RSE's Sootopolis - because in ORAS, the tree was a gift from AZ, long after he'd ended the Kalos war (which again, never happened in the other universe that Zinnia mentions).\n\nWhile one could still take the position that ORAS merely replaces RSE, and now we have a patchwork timeline consisting of FRLG, ORAS, HGSS, Platinum, BW, B2W2, XY, and SM, with the universe that Zinnia mentions being a completely unknown realm, it seems altogether simpler for ORAS to fall into a different universe alongside XY, SM, and any other games that feature Mega Evolution (a convenient litmus test for determining which universe a game falls into). This means that the events shown in RSE can not only remain intact unlike those of RBY or GSC, but can even have narrative relevance, as they depict what the world would be like without Mega Evolution and Infinity Energy.\n\nIf one chooses to say that ORAS just replace RSE, then the question still stands as to what the alternative world Zinnia mentions is all about - and with \"It's the world of RSE\" being pretty much a perfect answer to that question, what good does it do to gloss over it?\n\nFurthermore, ORAS aren't even the first games to depict a multiverse, although they are the first to do so prominently. But in BW, there is a small subquest where a man in Opelucid expresses regret over a fight he had with his father (in Black Version)/anxiety about his son's future (in White Version). In either game, he specifically asks you to bring him a Pok\u00e9mon that knows Charge and comes from a world that is either rustic and traditional (the world of Pok\u00e9mon White) or technologically advanced (the world of Pok\u00e9mon Black).", "id": "darmmia"}], [{"comment": "Pretty sure its actually based of the rocket that orbited the moon between 2007 and 2009 nicknamed selene.

However, I never played Emerald, because for all the improvements Ruby and Sapphire brought to the series, I didn't want to deal with their bullshit again.\n\nAnyway, the water was even worse in Gen 3. In addition to all the issues you mentioned, there was the fact that the pace was *glacial*.\n\nRuby and Sapphire introduced the awesome feature that is the running shoes, allowing the player to zip around the environment even before obtaining the bike. So the player dashes through the first few badges of the game, obtains the bike, then merrily speeds through each location of the game. Until they hit Lilycove, that is. Once they depart for Mossdeep, their pace slows to a crawl - they can't ride their bike and the running shoes do nothing, leaving them stuck at walking speed. The trip to Mossdeep is tediously slow, on top of every 5 or so tiles being a battle and the team slowly punching itself to death.\n\nAs a bit of extra frustration, do you notice anything else Tentacool and Wingull have in common? Yep, both of their sub-types are resistant to Grass. So if one was relying on Grass-type as their go to solution for Water-type Pokemon - say their starter was Grass-type or something crazy like that - it's not going to do a lot of good. (Grass may not be resisted, but it's no more effective than using, say, a Dark-type attack.)\n\nORAS did solve the swim speed issue, but they managed to introduce another (smaller) frustration to Hoenn's waters: the hidden items. When using dive, one can find various treasures, some in obvious places - an empty patch surrounded by seaweed - some in not-so-obvious places - in a random portion of a strip of seaweed. There wouldn't be anything wrong with that, but unfortunately, the item finder doesn't work underwater, meaning one has to search for them blindly. While most of the items are nice, but mundane, there are a few unique items that can be found as well - specifically, all of the Plates. It won't affect most players, but should one actually want one of the Plates, have fun blindly searching the numerous dive spots!

In addition to all the issues you mentioned, there was the fact that the pace was *glacial*.\n\nRuby and Sapphire introduced the awesome feature that is the running shoes, allowing the player to zip around the environment even before obtaining the bike. So the player dashes through the first few badges of the game, obtains the bike, then merrily speeds through each location of the game. Until they hit Lilycove, that is. Once they depart for Mossdeep, their pace slows to a crawl - they can't ride their bike and the running shoes do nothing, leaving them stuck at walking speed. The trip to Mossdeep is tediously slow, on top of every 5 or so tiles being a battle and the team slowly punching itself to death.\n\nAs a bit of extra frustration, do you notice anything else Tentacool and Wingull have in common?

In Gens III-VI, these variables always held identical values for any given wild Pok\u00e9mon, but in Gen VII, these two values can be different.\n\nIf the code in the games were something like the following:\n\n    function getSynchronizePok\u00e9mon(party) {\n        # Is the active Pok\u00e9mon's ability Synchronize? If so, say its name.

These are all mechanics that worked differently in the generations before it than the one where the change was first made:\n\n* Paralysis reduced Speed by 75% before Gen VII, but only 50% in Gen VII. Therefore, this paralysis nerf is a bug.\n\n* A Pok\u00e9mon hitting itself in confusion was reduced from 50% before Gen VII to 33% in Gen VII.

Therefore, in pre-Gen VII context, this probability change was a bug.\n\nDo you see how these claims don't work? Just because the functionality of a mechanic changes between generations for better or for worse doesn't mean that something is a bug. Yes, there is the possibility of some developer accidentally changing some of the numbers used in the code (or in the case of Synchronize and Natures, the variables that are checked in battle), but none of us know whether or not this is the case, so we can't assume that these functionality changes are bugs. Because we didn't participate in the coding of the game, we don't know the intentions of the game developers, and so it is meaningless to factor in developer intent.

The reinforcements instead have a 50% chance of copying whatever Pokemon is in the front of your party.

I frequent the Fire Emblem sub, and after being inundated with fan art after the latest release, they decided to create \"found\" fan art threads for people to share works from other artists.

Some of them were left up for a long time, but I think most were eventually removed so I can't really complain. I really sympathize with you guys though, you are trying to complete a sisyphean task here. Looking at the new queue right now, over 50% are rule violating in some way (mostly rule 3). How do you combat that?\n\nI think that you could probably use automod more effectively to make things easier for you (i.e. automatically remove shiny posts, posts with 'question' in the title, etc. It would work similarly to the regex I sent you guys to remove the code giveaways outside of the giveaway thread and of which you are currently using a modified version).

There were two large reasons we moved toward this policy.\n****\n1) You'd have to be living in Diglett's Cave to not notice that  one of the biggest complaints we see in the comments is that, prior to the SM release, the sub was becoming \"fan-art only\".  This created an environment for power users to post art as their ticket to ride the karma train.\n\nAs mentioned when this rule went live, this was only going to last up until the SM release; however, we had an overly *positive* reaction from the community, both in comments and modmail, about the rule, that we decided to keep it in place.\n\nOf course, just keeping it would contradict our policy of trying to get feedback for major changes to the sub, hence it being called out in the body of this post.  If the tide changes and the vocal majority wants it to remain OC Art Only, thy will be done, /r/pokemon.\n\n2) Often times, art went unsourced or no credit was given.  A reverse Google image search solves that problem, but it's been my personal experience that if our users could use Google, I wouldn't have to remove a ludicrous amount of questions that could be solved with Google.  When art is called out as OC in the title or flair, or the reddit username matches DA or tumblr usernames, it makes it super easy for us to know it's OC.\n\nNo one likes having their content go unsourced.  We have mods on our team who make a living as artists ([not me, I suck](http://i.imgur.com/lX1WZ8N.png)) and we believe content should be credited.  It's *so* much easier when you're the one who made it.\n****\nWe've sort of been a little lax on the \"I had an appendectomy and my removed vestigial organ drew this before rupturing\" part of it, but if it's a concern, we'll address it accordingly.  We can't prove your exploded appendix doesn't have a reddit and gave you permission to do so, but until the biohazard proves it was stolen from a puddle of poison, we give our users the benefit of the doubt.", "id": "dapmtms"}, {"comment": "For point one, I know of another sub who had problems with karma whores posting fanart non stop, so they put in a rule where you can only post a certain amount of pictures in a time period, though it's been relaxed by now. Isn't there an art filter anyways if people hate it so much?\n\nFor point two, I've posted hundreds of pieces of fanart before, and ALWAYS directly to the source if possible, so I definitely get the frustration about artists not being sourced or credited with their work being pointlessly uploaded to imgur for some reason. On the other hand, I like bringing more exposure and views to artists who don't post here themselves, since I always directly source stuff. It makes an artist's day when they see their work suddenly get thousands of views from here, you know?Also, seeing my favourite artists make super impressive art and then not being able to share it here for them is kinda disappointing.

People can claim all they want that they aren't posting for karma because it's imaginary internet points, but also why else track down so much art and post so much of it, especially when it isn't yours? \n\nPretty sure I've just historically been very, very vocal about why I don't think this sub should be as accommodating towards non OC fanart, so maybe I'm a little jaded and we clearly disagree, but I really think the people that are upset about the rule are really just upset because they can no longer reap the perceived benefits of posting a mega crapton of stuff that isn't theirs.

I've been on DeviantArt for 9 yrs, and I've been a fan of artwork for as long as I can remember. Thus, the art I used to post were just pieces I ran across on a daily basis anyways! \n\nAnd to be honest, I don't think we're really disagreeing with one another. I'm perfectly OK with this OC-only rule, and I kind of hope it stays this way. Even if the rule changed back, I don't think I would want to go back to posting. My original intention was to share some of the amazing pieces I came across through my daily browsing and to give the artists some extra recognition for their works.

I don't mind the OC-only rule at all. If anything, the rule is actually encouragement for me to create some OC art!

Though it's cool seeing some of the posts do well in the subreddit, the points mean absolutely nothing. Have you ever watched \"Whose Line is it Anyways?\" Same idea. The contestants win imaginary points that mean absolutely nothing. It's perfectly fine that I can't post, it's just frustrating when the sub as a whole voted on a new rule, yet others can't seem to comply with it. And I understand that a rule like that can be difficult to enforce, but it's frustrating nonetheless.\n\nAnd I do occasionally make non fan-art related posts. However, with the vast number of followers on this sub, pretty much any interesting topic I can think of has been discussed. Unless you'd like to see the millionth post about how you do a twirl when you keep walking in a circle or how Tauros has an evolution since there's a space for one after you catch him. Lol!\n\nAnd the wonderful thing about the Zootopia subreddit is that everyone absolutely loves fan art! Myself and a few others are known for posting fan art on there, and everyone absolutely loves it! We all give the artists credit, provide direct links to the artwork, and will oftentimes post additional links in the comments supporting the artists. It's such a different community there, and there's never been backlash like there has been on this sub. \n\nTLDR: I really don't care about the points.

The UBs you hunt post-game are remarked to have Beast Boost as a side effect of being drenched in the radiation caused by Ultra Wormhole transportation.\n\nI'd expect the reason Necrozma doesn't have Beast Boost and isn't classified as an Ultra Beast to be simply that he is very old, the radiation has worn off. This could also explain why it's never been noticed by interpol too. They remark that the UBs are violent due to their sudden removal from their home dimension. The violence is really just panic and confusion. It also stands to reason that Necrozma is very old due to its lack of violent actions.\n\nI'm not sure where I was going with this, but I just think that Necrozma is simply an old Ultra Beast who has calmed down and adjusted to our dimension, losing the Boost Boost from the Wormhole radiation.

Now, unlike most games, Pokemon STILL does NOT have multiple save files, so for the sake of peace, makes SURE each kid at the very least, has their own copy of whichever pair of games you go with (X&Y, OmegaRuby & Alpha Sapphire, or Sun & Moon), and if you can afford it, PLEASE get them thier own systems.\n\nNow, to explain the consoles themselves:\n\n3DS/3DSXL- The \"original\" models of the 3DS\n\n2DS- Cheaper version of the ORIGINAL model, does NOT have a clamshell design, and is designed for smaller children.\n\nNEW 3DS- a suped up version of the original model, it has better 3D, an extra C-stick, and a faster processor. This is highly recommended for  anyone that wants to play Smash Bros seriously and on the go. Pokemon Sun & Moon is optimized on the New 3DS.  There are some games on the Eshop that will only run on the 3DS (I think SNES Virtual Console games? and also, a few games like Xenoblade)\n\nAny games made for the old DS will work on the 3DS/2DS/N3DS.\n\nNow to explain HOW the games work exactly, in terms of cross-compatibility:\n\nthe games are always released in Pairs. Get Kid A the \"red\" one, and Kid B the \"blue\" one. These pairs are essentially the same game, with the same story, and same setting, but the difference is what Pokemon you can catch (the notable ones being whatever on the box!) and they can trade with each other to get whatever's not found in their version. Each set of \"Paired\" games take place in a different setting, and have different Pokemon available to catch.\n\nAdditionally, the games are divided by \"Generation\", meaning that any pairs of games released in that \"Generation\" can absolutely trade/battle with each other with little/no restrictions, since the engine is exactly the same, and the National Pokedex is the same as well.\n\nNow, for a breakdown of the games available for the systems:\n\nGeneration 6:\n\nPokemon X&Y- very noob-friendly, introduces Mega-Evolution, has a pretty decent story, and customization of your trainer *(I'm sure if any of your kids are girls they'll ADORE this) as well as have a healthy balance of old and new Pokemon. After the first Gym, they'll get to pick from on the Kanto starters, just as they did in GO!\n\nPokemon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire- Remakes of the old Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, from the Gameboy Advance era. Has Pokemon Contests, Secret Bases, even more Mega Evolutions, better breeding options and move tutors, if they get into any of that, much cleaner UI, and what I think to be much funner ways of catching and hunting Pokemon. this does NOT have customizable trainers though.\n\n(*Not saying that only girls love fashion and customization, just that, girls tend to be more into that, and playing as a female does, sadly, have more options.)\n\nGeneration 7:\n\nRed, Blue, & Yellow EShop Ports- these are PORTS of the very first Pokemon games, Red, Blue, and Yellow, with minor modificatios to allow trading/battling to work with the Hardware. These games are only compatible with each other and CANNOT Battle or Trade with any other games. HOWEVER, in January, there will be an update to the \"Pokemon Bank\" App (I will elaborate later in this post) to allow a one-way transfer to Sun & Moon. As these are straight up PORTS of old black-and-white games from 20 years ago, they may not enjoy it as much as the other games. Also to note, that these are DOWNLAOD ONLY, and do NOT retail/cart version, thusly, cannot be switched to different 3DSes\n\nSun & Moon- These are the newest games, and focus more on Z-Moves, with Mega Evolution being a post-game thing. While these games CAN be played on the old 3DS/2DS, it is STRONGLY recommended that these ONLY be played on the NEW 3DS, as playing on the older model is slow at times, and sometimes can even CRASH. (I have personally never experienced any crashing, but I can attest tot he lag in the bigger battles, and I'm on the Old 3DSXL) Though, the kids might not even notice it. One thing to note about Sun & Moon is that there is a LOT of story compared to the normally minimal story in most Pokemon games, so for MAXIMUM enjoyment, they should be able to read decently, and have some patience, as the beginning, and (apparently) the ending have some VERY long cutscenes. The rest of the cutscenes though, aren't horribly long. Oh by the way, Customization is back, AND, since they're the newest games, they will start getting special \"Mystery Gift\" events throughout the year, make sur eyou check the official Pokemon website, or Serebii or soemthing on a monthly basis. (Right now until January there's an event for Munchlax, and starting on Monday, once they've beaten the game (Become the \"Champion\") they'll be able to scan a QR Code to get Magearna.)\n\nPokemon Bank:\n\nthis is downloaded from the Eshop, and requires an ANNUAL subscription of 5USD$\n\nPokemon Bank is a way to Transfer Pokemon from Generation 5 (Black, White, Black2, White2) into Generation 6, and (in January) from Generation 6/RBY to Sun & Moon (note: RBY will NOT be able to be transferred to Gen6)\n\nBesides transferring, the Bank is used to store your Pokemon in the cloud. This would be handy to have around if somebody misplaces their 3DS, or even if you can only afford 1 system. They can still \"Trade\" with each other, since any XY/ORAS game can connect to it and deposit/withdraw form it. You can even sort the boxes into different groups, so if only system has it, each kid can still have their own sections.\n\n---\n\nIf you feel like it, you can also play the older games from the DS Era: Generation 4 & 5. I skipped most of Gen 5, so I can't say much, just that Black & White are the first games, and Black2 & White2 are sequels that take place 2 years later (You can still play the sequels without playing the first pair though, as it's a different adventure, but in the same region.) (Someone help me explain Gen 5 better in the comments!)\n\nGeneration 4:\n\nDiamond & Pearl- Set in the Sinnoh region, feature Pokemon Contests alongside the usual battling, a nice rich story, has a fun multiplayer feature, called the Sinnoh Underground, where players can dig up items and have secret bases, and visit each other.\n\nPlatinum- The last of what was knows as the \"Third Versions\", this is Diamond and Pearl, with some enhancements, and a slightly different different story (and the Distortion World, which is totally cool), & more pokemon to catch.\n\nHeartGold & Soul Silver- Remakes of Gold, Silver, and Crystal from the Gameboy Color era. These feature 2 regions (Johto, and Kanto), and 16 Gym Badges, improved breeding mechanics, prettier graphics, and if you're lucky, the ability to use the Pokewalker (it's basically a tamgotchi-style thing youc an take around with you and raise you Pokemon. I say \"If you're lucky\" because it is very hard to find the game WITH a Pokewalker, and for a good price.)\n\nDo note, that if you go with Generation 4 or 5, there WILL be some online features that will be missing, as the servers for ALL of the original DS games have long since shut down. If they're just playing with each other though, they should be fine. (And on the note of online features, Generation 6 & 7 have far more online features than Gen 4 & 5 ever offered)\n\nAlso, Generation 4's Pokemon can do a one-way transfer into Generation 5, as long as you have 2 systems (these can be a regular DS and/or 3DSes). and anything from Generation 5's games can be transferred into Generation 6\n\n---\n\nI suppose the best way to do it would be to get them each a  2DS/New 3DS (young/klutzy kids- 2DS, older/not-klutzy kids- New 3DS) and, depending on how many games you feel like buying over time, HG&SS>B2&W2>X&Y/OR&AS>Sun&Moon (Yes, I'm rather torn on X&Y vs OR&AS)"], [1, "The new 3ds will have the most power and handle double battles better, but if some lag isn't an issue any of the models of the 3ds or 2ds will be fine."], [1, "A 3DS is the best bet it can play the new 3D games like Sun/Moon X/Y and OR/AS and the old Ds ones like pearl etc and spin offs like pokemon dungeon.

However, a lot of the way these two work is different than the older ones. If you were wanting them to play through a more traditional game with gym battles and all that, X/Y is probably the next best place to start. It's not worth it to go older than the games on 3DS since you're not really gaining anything as a new player. You can play all the old DS ones on a 3DS still however if you really want to.\n\nThere's no timeline or story to follow really across all the games. They all follow basically the same story formula, but there's nothing really to strongly link them. There's a lot of nostalgia and introductions to characters from old games in Sun/Moon that you'll miss without playing a bunch of the older games. They'll also reference other regions that were specific to the old games or Pokemon that aren't in the game, but this is true for all the games.\n\nSun/Moon though are probably my favorites so far. There's a lot of welcome quality of life changes that came in these. The Island Challenge did leave me missing gym battles a bit though.\n\nFinally, on 3DS, Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire and X/Y will let you transfer Pokemon between the games using Pokemon Bank which costs $5 per year to keep it up and store Pokemon in it. You'll probably want to buy at least one from each set eventually anyways to get the Pokemon that are exclusive to each game set.

The idea is to encourage people to trade with each other because there will always be a few they can't get on their own. ", "id": "darjnub"}, {"comment": "Okay cheers for all the tips!", "id": "darmhqw"}], [{"comment": "The most current games are on the \"3DS Family\", which means The 3DS, 2DS, and New 3DS. Now, unlike most games, Pokemon STILL does NOT have multiple save files, so for the sake of peace, makes SURE each kid at the very least, has their own copy of whichever pair of games you go with (X&Y, OmegaRuby & Alpha Sapphire, or Sun & Moon), and if you can afford it, PLEASE get them thier own systems.\n\nNow, to explain the consoles themselves:\n\n3DS/3DSXL- The \"original\" models of the 3DS\n\n2DS- Cheaper version of the ORIGINAL model, does NOT have a clamshell design, and is designed for smaller children.\n\nNEW 3DS- a suped up version of the original model, it has better 3D, an extra C-stick, and a faster processor. This is highly recommended for  anyone that wants to play Smash Bros seriously and on the go. Pokemon Sun & Moon is optimized on the New 3DS.  There are some games on the Eshop that will only run on the 3DS (I think SNES Virtual Console games? and also, a few games like Xenoblade)\n\nAny games made for the old DS will work on the 3DS/2DS/N3DS.\n\nNow to explain HOW the games work exactly, in terms of cross-compatibility:\n\nthe games are always released in Pairs. Get Kid A the \"red\" one, and Kid B the \"blue\" one. These pairs are essentially the same game, with the same story, and same setting, but the difference is what Pokemon you can catch (the notable ones being whatever on the box!) and they can trade with each other to get whatever's not found in their version. Each set of \"Paired\" games take place in a different setting, and have different Pokemon available to catch.\n\nAdditionally, the games are divided by \"Generation\", meaning that any pairs of games released in that \"Generation\" can absolutely trade/battle with each other with little/no restrictions, since the engine is exactly the same, and the National Pokedex is the same as well.\n\nNow, for a breakdown of the games available for the systems:\n\nGeneration 6:\n\nPokemon X&Y- very noob-friendly, introduces Mega-Evolution, has a pretty decent story, and customization of your trainer *(I'm sure if any of your kids are girls they'll ADORE this) as well as have a healthy balance of old and new Pokemon. After the first Gym, they'll get to pick from on the Kanto starters, just as they did in GO!\n\nPokemon Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire- Remakes of the old Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald, from the Gameboy Advance era. Has Pokemon Contests, Secret Bases, even more Mega Evolutions, better breeding options and move tutors, if they get into any of that, much cleaner UI, and what I think to be much funner ways of catching and hunting Pokemon. this does NOT have customizable trainers though.\n\n(*Not saying that only girls love fashion and customization, just that, girls tend to be more into that, and playing as a female does, sadly, have more options.)\n\nGeneration 7:\n\nRed, Blue, & Yellow EShop Ports- these are PORTS of the very first Pokemon games, Red, Blue, and Yellow, with minor modificatios to allow trading/battling to work with the Hardware. These games are only compatible with each other and CANNOT Battle or Trade with any other games. HOWEVER, in January, there will be an update to the \"Pokemon Bank\" App (I will elaborate later in this post) to allow a one-way transfer to Sun & Moon. As these are straight up PORTS of old black-and-white games from 20 years ago, they may not enjoy it as much as the other games. Also to note, that these are DOWNLAOD ONLY, and do NOT retail/cart version, thusly, cannot be switched to different 3DSes\n\nSun & Moon- These are the newest games, and focus more on Z-Moves, with Mega Evolution being a post-game thing. While these games CAN be played on the old 3DS/2DS, it is STRONGLY recommended that these ONLY be played on the NEW 3DS, as playing on the older model is slow at times, and sometimes can even CRASH. (I have personally never experienced any crashing, but I can attest tot he lag in the bigger battles, and I'm on the Old 3DSXL) Though, the kids might not even notice it. One thing to note about Sun & Moon is that there is a LOT of story compared to the normally minimal story in most Pokemon games, so for MAXIMUM enjoyment, they should be able to read decently, and have some patience, as the beginning, and (apparently) the ending have some VERY long cutscenes. The rest of the cutscenes though, aren't horribly long. Oh by the way, Customization is back, AND, since they're the newest games, they will start getting special \"Mystery Gift\" events throughout the year, make sur eyou check the official Pokemon website, or Serebii or soemthing on a monthly basis. (Right now until January there's an event for Munchlax, and starting on Monday, once they've beaten the game (Become the \"Champion\") they'll be able to scan a QR Code to get Magearna.)\n\nPokemon Bank:\n\nthis is downloaded from the Eshop, and requires an ANNUAL subscription of 5USD$\n\nPokemon Bank is a way to Transfer Pokemon from Generation 5 (Black, White, Black2, White2) into Generation 6, and (in January) from Generation 6/RBY to Sun & Moon (note: RBY will NOT be able to be transferred to Gen6)\n\nBesides transferring, the Bank is used to store your Pokemon in the cloud. This would be handy to have around if somebody misplaces their 3DS, or even if you can only afford 1 system. They can still \"Trade\" with each other, since any XY/ORAS game can connect to it and deposit/withdraw form it. You can even sort the boxes into different groups, so if only system has it, each kid can still have their own sections.\n\n---\n\nIf you feel like it, you can also play the older games from the DS Era: Generation 4 & 5. I skipped most of Gen 5, so I can't say much, just that Black & White are the first games, and Black2 & White2 are sequels that take place 2 years later (You can still play the sequels without playing the first pair though, as it's a different adventure, but in the same region.) (Someone help me explain Gen 5 better in the comments!)\n\nGeneration 4:\n\nDiamond & Pearl- Set in the Sinnoh region, feature Pokemon Contests alongside the usual battling, a nice rich story, has a fun multiplayer feature, called the Sinnoh Underground, where players can dig up items and have secret bases, and visit each other.\n\nPlatinum- The last of what was knows as the \"Third Versions\", this is Diamond and Pearl, with some enhancements, and a slightly different different story (and the Distortion World, which is totally cool), & more pokemon to catch.\n\nHeartGold & Soul Silver- Remakes of Gold, Silver, and Crystal from the Gameboy Color era. These feature 2 regions (Johto, and Kanto), and 16 Gym Badges, improved breeding mechanics, prettier graphics, and if you're lucky, the ability to use the Pokewalker (it's basically a tamgotchi-style thing youc an take around with you and raise you Pokemon. I say \"If you're lucky\" because it is very hard to find the game WITH a Pokewalker, and for a good price.)\n\nDo note, that if you go with Generation 4 or 5, there WILL be some online features that will be missing, as the servers for ALL of the original DS games have long since shut down. If they're just playing with each other though, they should be fine. (And on the note of online features, Generation 6 & 7 have far more online features than Gen 4 & 5 ever offered)\n\nAlso, Generation 4's Pokemon can do a one-way transfer into Generation 5, as long as you have 2 systems (these can be a regular DS and/or 3DSes). and anything from Generation 5's games can be transferred into Generation 6\n\n---\n\nI suppose the best way to do it would be to get them each a  2DS/New 3DS (young/klutzy kids- 2DS, older/not-klutzy kids- New 3DS) and, depending on how many games you feel like buying over time, HG&SS>B2&W2>X&Y/OR&AS>Sun&Moon (Yes, I'm rather torn on X&Y vs OR&AS)", "id": "darkh8u"}, {"comment": "I'll volunteer to explain Gen 5 then:\n\nBlack and White: This pair of games takes place in Unova. Unlike the games in generations 4 and 6, Black and White have few non-battling features but make up for this deficiency with an incredibly well-done main story. Pokemon from previous generations do not appear, but it too makes up for this by introducing more new Pokemon than any generation in the entire series. Pushes the DS system to its limit, with much more ambitiously designed towns, routes, and cities than those of Platinum of HGSS, and reaches similar heights with its soundtrack. Was overall the most RPG-like prior to Sun and Moon.\n\nBlack and White 2: Another anomaly in the series, and once again for the better. The only installment to be a direct sequel to an earlier one, these games also take place in Unova, except 2 years after the events of Black and White (and the region has changed significantly in that time). Introduced a bunch of user-friendly features such as being able to instantly lay down a Repel once one wears off, and has a bunch of postgame content once the main story is finished. Unlike BW you can catch plenty of older Pokemon in this one, as well as any that were introduced in that game. Story isn't quite as good as BW1 on its own but still serves really well as a follow-up. I strongly recommend that you only get this one after beating Black or White 1, and just as important, get the sequel that corresponds to the one you had before (so Black 2 of you beat Black, White 2 if you beat White).", "id": "darmhsi"}, {"comment": "Cheers for the lengthy info there, I feel I caught up.

It was so adorable for him to turn his head and look at me and with those messages like \"you and Delphox are breathing in prefect sync\" the problem is, is that I didn't use any other Pok\u00e9mon most of the time because of the exp share. Same with ORAS. But Sun and Moon, I turned off exp share and it made all the difference. I felt really REALLY bad when I exchanged a Pok\u00e9mon for a new Pok\u00e9mon. I've never felt that way. I felt like I had a bond with my Pok\u00e9mon. Luckly, poke pelgo exists so I don't have to feel as bad, so I leave Pokemon I had in my party in the relaxing place. I don't take their held items though, it doesn't feel right. It feels like I'm taking their rights away or something. I caught a shiny gastodon and I had a slowbro in my party. I obviously wanted a shiny on my team; but this slowbro was a tank for the elite four part of the Pok\u00e9mon league. I felt bad for the guy, he had like a story. He was my first water type in the game, and I lost it when I saw that I could find slowpoke so early in the game. It was my 3rd Pok\u00e9mon. He was never really good but I gave him a quick claw to help him out. When he started to tank the elite four I was like \"HELL YEAH, It's time for you to shine all those times you fainted, go show the world what you're made of!\" That stuff is like the stuff that happens in the anime, it doesn't happen in real life. And that's why Sun and Moon is my 2nd favorite Pok\u00e9mon game (DPP is a three way tie for first place; mostly because there are no flaws I can see with the game and it's the first game I owned, beat, and played it extensively; until the day I regret most, were I sold all my wii games and all my DS games, and half of my 3DS games, which were all really really good games (literally no shovelware) and among those were every Pok\u00e9mon game I ever owned, including my 600 hour save file of Hearthgold with my shiny Golem and Magikarp, forever lost; and my maxed out time on Diamond with a legitimate living dex and a shiny shinx I caught on the first playthrough .

Standard DVD had a capacity of 4.7 GB single layer and 8.5 GB dual layer.\n\nNo one wanted to make GameCube games because miniDVD offered considerably less space. Voice acting was getting huge during that generation, so games needed more space for audio files, and audio files take up a ton of memory. Better graphics required higher resolution models, which meant even more space was needed. The GameCube didn't offer that. That's why most games on the GC looked like hot garbage. They didn't have the space for higher res models and textures. Nintendo has had a history of using inferior hardware for a long time now. Most people don't realize it started at the GC, not the Wii. We can argue the N64 as well, but cartridges did have way better load times, so I can understand Nintendo's logic there. Cost is just what killed them. CDs were super cheap, but cartridges weren't.\n\nThe most ironic thing about it is that the GC actually had more power than the PS2, so its games were 100% capable of looking better than PS2 titles.

Devs just didn't have the storage space needed.\n\nNo one cared that much about online play back in those days. The Xbox had the best online play back then, but the PS2 still dominated.

An Atari Lynx lasted 3-4 hours. A GB lasted 10 hours, and the GB Pocket lasted 20 hours. It really wasn't hard to pick between those choices. Plus, competitor prices were insane.\n\nThese days Nintendo uses inferior hardware for no good reason.

As in they try not to build the game from scratch for each new version but make enough changes to where it feels like they did.\n\nAssuming this is how they operate, changes to old code, whether its a change or even deleting is like making a change to the foundation of your house, but making a change like moving where the plumbing routes go.  You want to make sure you don't end up breaking a lot of things that you have built on top of that foundation because that means more time and money and delay in the project.  Making these foundational changes have to go through a lot of approval and investigation to make sure that the changes could fit into the timeline of the project.\n\nPC has had a few changes built on top of it over the years, but making the process more intuitive would mean they would delete a lot of the old process and rewrite it how they did in SuMo.  All while incorporating the new features and other \"important\" changes that they wanted to add to this version.  Each project will have priority of features and changes, this just wasn't up there but obviously they wanted to make the process better by making a few changes here and there, but it ultimately needed to be rewritten.  Each feature and change requires planning, designing, etc, and you only have so much time so you have to figure out what will fit the timeline.\n\nTL:DR; Each release has priority of features/functionality/improvements that have to fit a tight timeline (1 - 2 years).

Also feels pretty special to to be the \"first\" champion of the region.\n* Battles are quite a bit more challenging than X/Y/OR/AS.\n* PokeRefresh is more intuitive and useful than Pok\u00e9mon-Amie, especially the ability to cure status ailments.\n* Z-Moves are very satisfying to use.\n* Regional Formes.\n* Lillie.\n\nThere's a *lot* of reasons to love this generation.", "id": "dapkyxo"}], [{"comment": "Yeah its neat, a whole lotta misclicks from pressing A too many times due to muscle memory though.", "id": "dap2zck"}], [{"comment": "Not only that, but they put the 'move items' option INSIDE the 'move Pokemon' system. It infuriated me that we had to go out to go back in to switch between the two, I kept telling myself why don't they just put a button on the touchscreen to switch between both? And well they did it. About time, great addition.\n\nEDIT: I was under the impression that you could not move items on battlebox Pokemon directly, but that is simply because it is only a registering thing now, so you can use 'move items' on the source Pokemon in its box.
