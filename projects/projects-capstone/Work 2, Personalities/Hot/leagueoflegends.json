Why aren't there any ADCs like this? They're all supposed to stand in safe positions even when they don't exist.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Actually, I think I might be onto something.\n\nWhat are the differences between marksmen and mages? The latter are more restricted by cooldowns, but a lot of the champions I mentioned (Ryze, Rumble, Karthus) can put out damage *constantly* so that's not an important difference here, I don't think. But a very big difference between mages and marksmen is **lifesteal**. This is something all ADCs build and it might be the single biggest reason that ADCs are so easy to kill.\n\nWhen any champion has sustained in-combat healing (like Aatrox) the only counterplay is to kite them out (doesn't work against ADCs obviously) or to kill them really, really quickly. Otherwise they heal back to full health in 2 seconds. So Riot made all ADCs really squishy, even compared to mages.\n\nMaybe lifesteal (all of it, from items, runes, and masteries) needs a ranged-melee split just like Grasp of the Undying has. And ADCs could be rebalanced to have higher natural defenses. Maybe some of them could even have built-in shields and other tricks like Battle Mages do.

We have \"battle mages\" which are stuff like Ryze, Rumble, Karthus, Swain, and Vladimir. These champions have shields, heals, and other abilities to survive close to the front line of teamfights and survive (or in Karthus' case, just keep on fighting) if they get focused. Why aren't there any ADCs like this? They're all supposed to stand in safe positions even when they don't exist.\n\n---\n\nEdit: Actually, I think I might be onto something.\n\nWhat are the differences between marksmen and mages? The latter are more restricted by cooldowns, but a lot of the champions I mentioned (Ryze, Rumble, Karthus) can put out damage *constantly* so that's not an important difference here, I don't think. But a very big difference between mages and marksmen is **lifesteal**. This is something all ADCs build and it might be the single biggest reason that ADCs are so easy to kill.\n\nWhen any champion has sustained in-combat healing (like Aatrox) the only counterplay is to kite them out (doesn't work against ADCs obviously) or to kill them really, really quickly. Otherwise they heal back to full health in 2 seconds. So Riot made all ADCs really squishy, even compared to mages.\n\nMaybe lifesteal (all of it, from items, runes, and masteries) needs a ranged-melee split just like Grasp of the Undying has. And ADCs could be rebalanced to have higher natural defenses. Maybe some of them could even have built-in shields and other tricks like Battle Mages do. We could increase the diversity of the class a lot if they don't all have huge lifesteal.\n\nTL;DR all ADCs feel terrible because they're Aatrox.", "id": "dapi1uh"}, {"comment": "Hopefully I can keep this relatively short but as a supp/bot main this is something I think about a lot. There's a lot of things wrong with the ADC role but the amount of work it would take to rectify it is huge.\n\nSome of the biggest things often cited are the \"ADC are fine. Every team always has one.\" and the \"ADC are needed for pushing towers.\" fallacies. Think about what ADC are: ranged physical damage DPS. Magic damage dealing champions are often taken mid, and typically your jungle/top are some kind of bruiser or tank. ADCs are nearly the only option for mage-esque physical damage DPS and are thus 'necessary' for a well rounded team. There's also the issue of the \"ADC are late-game gods\" perception. ADC are quite powerful later into the game, but they don't ascend to godhood. Later into the game they finally get access to mage-level damage, but their DPS is only god-tier if they are permitted high-uptime. They still disintegrate in milliseconds, most have weak defensive tools, and lack CC. This all comes together in heavily mitigating their 'god tier' DPS in real-world scenarios.\n\n\nThere's also a lot of other forces at play:\n\n- Even though ADC are relatively weak early, it's still quite difficult to take a physically damage melee champion botlane. They're very easy to harass as a ranged champion and it's why champions like Teemo and Quinn are reviled in the top lane.\n\n- Player aversion to flexing outside of the meta. Many players will INSTANTLY tilt the moment someone tries to take anything but an ADC into the Bot position. Trolling is rampant in these scenarios. Not only that but if game should end up not going in your team's favor you can be sure that regardless of you having anything to do with your team being behind, they'll look at you.\n\n- Near non-existent options for ranged physical damage alternatives.\n\nThe role SEVERELY lacks diversity. Where's my early game ADC? Why must the role be relegated to late-game 'beasts'? Where's my weaker scaling/lower damage ADC that has access to powerful defensive tools or hard CC (in a non-ultimate ability). Graves is probably the closest we have but he has similar issues to melee physical damage dealers due to his low range and the functionality of his autos. Most ADC are heavily auto based and while they don't feel horribly similar to each other the role is nowhere near as diverse as mages. I still believe crit to be anti-fun and anti-competitive but that's a discussion for another time.", "id": "dapsm8x"}, {"comment": "Riot informally acknowledged the fundamental lack of diversity in the marksman class [in their subclass list](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list). Mages are split between several specializations like artillery, control, and burst mages, but almost all marksmen are lumped together. I think they could be split between *mobile* and *long range* ADCs since the two are almost mutually exclusive, but you've got a bunch of outliers like Draven (not particularly mobile or long ranged) and Ezreal (very mobile and long ranged). But there's a lot of unexplored territory because all ADCs share lifesteal, which limits the power and uniqueness that can be put into their kits.\n\nBot lane melees are a difficult problem. I think they could be addressed by item innovations, but there would have to be a lot of special casing just so the items aren't exploited by solo laners.\n\nInnovating the bot lane meta is tricky because it's a duo lane. You *have* to cooperate with another player during the first 15 minutes of the game. That's the same reason people are so lax about who you choose to play toplane, it's an island and nobody really has to adapt to what you're doing.\n\nThe late-game scaling thing is all because of their itemization. Crit has a bunch of multiplicative stats that create exponential growth in your damage output as you buy your items. AP and tank stats scale more linearly. This could possibly be solved by nerfing or removing Infinity Edge just so that one multiplier (crit damage) is removed from the picture.\n\nI adore Graves' design. He's exactly what the class needs. And [he makes a strong argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5g3ayq/the_life_of_an_ad_carry_ftsneaky_doubleliftpray/dapq79q/) for why lifesteal on ranged champions needs to be nerfed.", "id": "daptt1a"}, {"comment": "Itemization is definitely a huge issue. Further exacerbated by a majority of the ADCs having such heavy emphasis on auto-attacks for the late-game scaling. If an ADC did a majority of their damage through mage-esque abilities with CDs then crit and lifesteal wouldn't be nearly as good on them. It's a symptom of the kits AND items. What you say is true too. As far as taking melee into the botlane; itemization could do a lot to alleviate those pains. Things like making Doran's Shield have stronger damage reduction against ranged autos.

Would you say money, or do you see potential in the current fnc roster?\n7.1 An extra question on the same topic, Rekkles in my eyes never lived up to the expectations, Caps and Jesse I know nothing about and Amazing is the only one I can actually believe to be in the same level as you are in, do you think that this new talent is worth betting on to fully develop in a year, Rekkles to actually start showing result, is Rekkles better than I actually think?\n7.2Is this just a gamble or you just think Fnatic is a better organisation than OG?\n\nHuge Fan since the beggining I hope you ll answer the questions and excuse my format.", "id": "daqgtma"}, {"comment": "heyoh! 1. i consider peke as a friend\n\n2. maybe because i put a lot more effort this split in particular myself, waking up early, watching vods by myself of top korean games before scrims, i didn't play much more soloq than before but i sort of had a schedule and will keep doing the same here.\n\n3. during this worlds we were playing a different meta than others, ( we were not playing much for toplane ) i think they were better overall obviously but my understanding of the macro game during worlds wasn't top tier, i didn't know how to communicate with amazing properly early game and was frustrated because others teams could.\n\n4. i don't think my style of playing the game is much more different than others, the only aspect that i'm different is  that i play much more for my team compare to other toplaners, maybe other pros have a better idea about my playstyle x) it's hard for me to reflect on my global play\n\n5. final against CLGEU at dreamhack, fav teammate Puszu, dreamhack/IPL5\n\n6. as many others said i think it would be nice to have a bit of both and time to play outside tournaments, traveling is so much fun !

We sit together a day or two before the show and talk about the most important stories to hit during our opening analyst desk and put down a few bullets like:\n\n\nTSM fastest game time in NA\n\n\nH2K great early game\n\n\nFaker likes broccoli \n\n\nWe will most of the time have a graphic or a replay for these specific bullets so its easy for everyone to follow. We can freely add other things (most have 2-3 extra points on their own) as we want and people rarely know exactly what the caster will say, they just know AT SOME POINT during the analyst desk segment we will touch on those 3 points.\n\n\n\nVedius adding his own joke at the end of this analyst desk and walking out is all him and just something he found funny. He might have asked Tsepha if it was OK he pulled a stunt, but that is not even needed. \n\n\nI am kind of proud that people think everything is 100 % scripted because it shows that we have good synergy and we can run a smooth show due to everyone being able to adapt.\n\n\n**TLDR:** Our show is never 100 % scripted. Script is not a bad thing though. It's the backbone of the show that allows the production crew to follow the flow of the show and makes it better and easier to time graphics and replays perfectly. \n\n\nThe things in the script for talent will be a few select bullet points (often with graphics-replays) and house keeping for the host.

We'll miss Huni, and we'll never stop cheering for him.\n\nFrom the article on http://immortals.gg/news/2016/12/02/farewell-huni/ : \n\nRecently, SKT announced that they\u2019ve signed former IMT top-laner Huni.  This offer represents an incredible opportunity for Huni to graduate from Immortals onto one of the finest League rosters the world has ever seen. When we first learned about the offer, we were thrilled for Huni, but there was one hiccup: Huni had already signed a multi-year contract with Immortals.\n\nWe found ourselves in a bit of a quandary.  Huni is an incredibly talented player who meshes well with our staff and other players; his skill is at the core of our 2017 ambitions.  And yet, preventing Huni from embarking on this new opportunity would be unforgivable.  \n\nThis is the single greatest challenge to our values as an organization that we have faced since our formation.  We pride ourselves on doing right by our players and creating a healthy environment for competition.  Above all else, we treat our players with respect, and hope that they leave Immortals as better individuals.\n\nThat last point is key here.  We\u2019re proud that the time Huni spent on Immortals helped craft him into the type of player that top Korean teams now look to recruit, and hope his heart will carry our values as he moves on.  \n\nHuni has chosen to accept the offer, and we won\u2019t get in his way.\n\n\u2014\n\nStatement from Head Coach Robert Yip:\n\n\u201cIt was my great pleasure to work with Huni in 2016 and now I have to say goodbye.  As an org we consistently look for the best players, always with an emphasis on how they will mesh together.  Personally this is the reason why Huni was the player that I had zero reservations about bringing back to Immortals.  He is a professional, incredibly smart and skilled player that always brings a positive attitude to the work environment.   His voice on the team and leadership qualities were at the forefront of our decision to bring him back.  A lot of people may have written him off after performances at the end of the season, citing \u2019tilting\u2019 issues or inability to play for the team.  What they would not have seen are the countless hours he spent developing himself as a person and as a player.  A freak wrist injury hours before our semi-final vs Cloud 9 in Summer robbed us of seeing the culmination of all of Huni\u2019s hard work and left Huni with a lot to prove which is why he was determined to join a top Korean team.\n\nI truly believe he moves on from his time with Immortals a stronger player because of the work that he put in combined with a good environment.  The transformation from Huni in spring split to the end of summer was night and day.  This is the sort of \u2018growth potential\u2019 that I saw in him and obviously SKT as well.  It was always his dream to play for SKT and while it saddens me as a coach to see him go, as his friend, nothing makes me happier.  \n\nBest of luck Huni, as always, I will cheer for you.\u201d"], [1152, "For clarity, this was not a poaching scenario, Huni had permission to speak with teams, and there was no buyout of the contract or any other transaction around it. Turning the dreams of a player into a trade or dealmaking is not something I have any interest in doing.\n\nGood luck in SKT Huni, I'll be cheering for you :'("], [800, "Immortals is a really respectable and professional organization.

We'll miss Huni, and we'll never stop cheering for him.\n\nFrom the article on http://immortals.gg/news/2016/12/02/farewell-huni/ : \n\nRecently, SKT announced that they\u2019ve signed former IMT top-laner Huni.  This offer represents an incredible opportunity for Huni to graduate from Immortals onto one of the finest League rosters the world has ever seen. When we first learned about the offer, we were thrilled for Huni, but there was one hiccup: Huni had already signed a multi-year contract with Immortals.\n\nWe found ourselves in a bit of a quandary.  Huni is an incredibly talented player who meshes well with our staff and other players; his skill is at the core of our 2017 ambitions.  And yet, preventing Huni from embarking on this new opportunity would be unforgivable.  \n\nThis is the single greatest challenge to our values as an organization that we have faced since our formation.  We pride ourselves on doing right by our players and creating a healthy environment for competition.  Above all else, we treat our players with respect, and hope that they leave Immortals as better individuals.\n\nThat last point is key here.  We\u2019re proud that the time Huni spent on Immortals helped craft him into the type of player that top Korean teams now look to recruit, and hope his heart will carry our values as he moves on.  \n\nHuni has chosen to accept the offer, and we won\u2019t get in his way.\n\n\u2014\n\nStatement from Head Coach Robert Yip:\n\n\u201cIt was my great pleasure to work with Huni in 2016 and now I have to say goodbye.  As an org we consistently look for the best players, always with an emphasis on how they will mesh together.  Personally this is the reason why Huni was the player that I had zero reservations about bringing back to Immortals.  He is a professional, incredibly smart and skilled player that always brings a positive attitude to the work environment.   His voice on the team and leadership qualities were at the forefront of our decision to bring him back.  A lot of people may have written him off after performances at the end of the season, citing \u2019tilting\u2019 issues or inability to play for the team.  What they would not have seen are the countless hours he spent developing himself as a person and as a player.  A freak wrist injury hours before our semi-final vs Cloud 9 in Summer robbed us of seeing the culmination of all of Huni\u2019s hard work and left Huni with a lot to prove which is why he was determined to join a top Korean team.\n\nI truly believe he moves on from his time with Immortals a stronger player because of the work that he put in combined with a good environment.  The transformation from Huni in spring split to the end of summer was night and day.  This is the sort of \u2018growth potential\u2019 that I saw in him and obviously SKT as well.  It was always his dream to play for SKT and while it saddens me as a coach to see him go, as his friend, nothing makes me happier.  \n\nBest of luck Huni, as always, I will cheer for you.\u201d", "id": "dapnojl"}, {"comment": "Constantly impressed with Noah's candor with IMT fans and standing by IMT's core values.

Figure ez eats another Karma Q auto as he lanterns in and finishes her, but now he's stuck with maybe 200 hp in a huge wave vs a pretty healthy Cait and no way out.\n\nThen he dies, Thresh probably does too since he lacks the damage to kill her in that wave before she kills him, loses that huge wave and probably the next one as well to turret. Now you're not just down a kill/even in kills with Cait if she isn't able to finish thresh, but you're down 2 and a half minion waves of xp and gold. If Karma still has ignite here, it's almost a guarantee that Cait gets the double.\n\nTaking lantern is not the right choice in that situation. As soon as Ezreal uses E like that, the play is over.

SKT has won the World Championship in 3/4 of their years of existence, and all 3 wins were with different rosters. \n\nThere's a reason there's a circle-jerk over Kkoma. He's better than just a good coach. He's not infallible, but Huni is a player who has showed some great play despite never getting a chance to play professionally in Korea. There's very little reason to think he won't grow a ton under SKT.

And you can't forget that this team had the TL problem child Piglet, who said that kkOma gave him the hardest time on the team to help him grow. \n\nThink about all of SKT's roster changes: picking up Bang, Wolf, MaRin, Easyhoon etc. I think that western fans who only see Korean teams at international events just assume that these guys were always gods and that of course a team like SKT would pick them up.  But Easyhoon, Bang, and Wolf already had professional experience and not many people would've thought of them as exceptional players when SKT picked them up. MaRin came from solo queue and honestly didn't look that great on SKT's second team. But the aforementioned players are known as gods now, and I'm not going to give all credit to kkOma, but surely he's been key in helping these players reach their potential. The only players that didn't look exceptional on SKT were T0M and Blank, but on a team not called \"SKT\", they wouldn't have been seen as bad players. There's a lot of pressure representing SKT that can get to rookie players.\n\nPlayers like Huni and Rush have so much raw potential. In a disciplined team like Fnatic under Deilor, Huni was a top 3 top laner in the world (IMO). Under a lax team like IMT (going off of Pobelter's comments on the team), Huni played Lucian top.

They act as if whatever player he coaches is bound to be the best thing ever, as if him coached P1 would make them win worlds and roster has nothing to do with it. \n\nI would personally love seeing Kkoma coach a western team or a lesser team like he proposed in a recent interview, to see if he's really all he's cracked up to be or if Faker has simply been an even bigger influence than we've expected.

He's probably currently a better laner than at least 2/3 of the tops that will be in NA this year, he is good in teamfights, that's all well and good.  However, will his inclusion in the team actually solve any of Echo Fox's problems?\n\nIs he a straight-forward upgrade to kfo in just about every measure across the board?  Yeah, probably.  Can he crap on the bottom-tier NA LCS tops and go even or ahead with the good ones?  Yeah, probably.  But Echo Fox's distinct problem as a team last season was that they didn't do anything on the map and passively lost every game through inaction. So unless he's hard-smashing his lane (which I saw him do occasionally in China, though he isn't really known for that last I remember) and transitioning that lead, or he's making amazing proactive map plays to get other lanes ahead, what have Echo Fox really gained?  It could be another case of a roster with fairly strong carries that simply aren't proactive enough to gain meaningful leads in games, and thus a lot of wasted money on an import with such a pedigree.\n\nWith Impact (his current perception from NA fans being inflated due to him popping off after the removal of lane swaps, before which he didn't shine as brightly as in the late parts of the season), it isn't as important for him to have amazing TPs or to perform at his World Championship level of play, as that team has strategies that can work around different roles getting ahead, and can play to build such advantages or expand them.  Impact can smash top and they can play around that, or he can go even and they can play around Jensen, or if bot pops off they can play around that.  While Impact definitely gives C9 their monies' worth, he fits into a functioning machine without explicitly having to be the lynch pin.\n\nThis is not a 1:1 comparison to the Echo Fox situation, where you have a super-consistent and stable mid who will almost never pop off on his own, and an ADC who has proved he can work on teams with tools meant to empower him, but finds none of those tools in the previous Echo Fox line-up.  If the three new signings in that line-up don't do anything to address these core issues (and with Looper being the highest-profile acquisition by far, thus comes the heightened expectation of him improving the team greatly), it doesn't matter where they fall in skill with their contemporaries in the league, because the team as a whole will not even be as good as the sum of its parts.\n\nSo essentially, I'm skeptical of whether what Looper adds to the team will make the team good, as opposed to being in question of his value as a player in general.", "id": "dapj477"}, {"comment": "> However, will his inclusion in the team actually solve any of Echo Fox's problems?\n\nOne of EF problems was that enemies only needed to focus Froggen and take advantage of Keith overextending when soaking side lanes to win.\n\nLooper on a Poppy or a Maokai can make Froggen almost unreachable which would allow him to do so much more than he was able last year (which stil. was ending with positive score)...\n\n> But Echo Fox's distinct problem as a team last season was that they didn't do anything on the map and passively lost every game through inaction.\n\nA big part of this problem was HAard being outpreassured in almost every game.

Impact gets praised for winning lane as Gnar. Huni gets blamed for every defeat, and when he hard carries (which he does in about half of all IMT games) it's ignored.\n\nHe's a much, much more impactful player than Hauntzer or Impact, or any western toplaner ever tbh.

He was considered a top 3 player in his role, he had literally just taken down Bjerg with CLG and played super well. He looked worse on IMT in spring and in Summer he was their biggest carry alongside RO.\n\nHuni cost them both playoff appearances IMT had. He played greedy and got rolled over in his lane both bo5s. Did you even watch either series? He didn't even bring much pressure, he actually just gave away free kills and forced RO into terrible position both times. Same with his semi-final appearance against KOO. \n\nIn his game against impact he counter-picked the Gnar and had an even/winning lane and went like 1/5, most deaths being really, really silly. That continued on for most of the series where he gave up a ton of advantages on his own. Watch his game on GP where he walks up and gets caught and kills his whole team trying to get greedy, which eventually cost them the series. Watch his yasuo play where he kills himself 1v2 trying to make some flashy play. Yes, people on reddit ignore his carry performances sometimes and he DOES get an unfair amount of shit, but he is also overrated by the other half who seemingly ignore the fact that he gets the highest % gold-share of any top laner, TONS of pressure from his jungler, and doesn't show up when it matters very often.\n\n Sure, on Fnatic he was an absolute monster, same with his first split on IMT. The second split he struggled A LOT and it was his own doing. Kkoma has taken mediocre players and turned them into superstars and I definitely think Huni has the potential to be really good, top-tier (as in Ssumday/Smeb level) even, but saying he was comfortably the best last split especially towards the end either signals you're not very good at the game, are biased toward Huni, or didn't watch the games. Sorry if that comes off as rude, but it's just the truth. He played like dogshit in playoffs and he honestly has a tendency to do so. In fnatic's Summer playoff run he looked weak, at worlds he threw a lot of games, and in both NA playoffs he looked much worse than in regular season. \n\nHauntzer had an equally good/better full split and Impact was miles better by the end of the split, although granted Huni was 10x better than impact during the majority of the regular season.

(tab for scoreboard, tilde is champions only click, you can put a command on shift if you want).\n\nI would argue honestly that using pinky on ctrl/shift is much more taxing and requires larger hands than pinky on Q. Pinky has the 2nd largest range of motion behind your thumb, limiting it by shoving your hand up indicates that you have a hard time stretching your pinky to control/shift.\n\nOn the contrary: R is used once every minute or so, and D and F are used on average once every 5-6 minutes most likely. These keys don't require a dedicated finger because their use-limit is so low. You should be using tab once-twice a minute, checking items, teammates c/d's etc. Ctrl will get used quite often as well.

I have purchased 129,297 IP worth. I did this with just trying to purchase runes that were in the meta when I purchased them or ones I felt necessary for certain champs. I did not go out of my way to purchase all runes like many others have just for the IP sink. With reductions and other things taken into account I am pushing well over 135K.\n\n\nThat is a ridiculous amount of IP for someone new to the scene to try and gather even if they bought every single champ they wanted with RP. At 250 IP/Game (Win of the Day) for 130K IP is 520 days. Now sure, all of the runes I have are not necessary and Riot has done a good job by making all T2 runes 1IP and 50% price reduction some \"standard\" T3 runes, but that still is a daunting task for any newcomer. \n\n\nThe problem Riot is facing is a very complex one. Runes have been a part of LoL since the beginning - over 7 years. They are one of the things that allowed for customization in how you played a champion. However, if you didn't get in early they now are just an anchor pulling you down and stopping you from grabbing champions you want. There are a vast number of people that like runes (as they are) and don't want them change. There are a vast number of people who want them removed all together. And then there are a vast number of people who want something in the middle or don't care at all. It is going to be hard for Riot to find a balance where all the groups are happy with it and I doubt they will. \n\nRunes are fun but they definitely need price updating if anything or a regular rotating IP sale cycle that if they had started years ago probably wouldn't see as many people pissed about runes as they are now. \n\nRiot needs to find a way to lower the IP cost of getting into the game properly. Be that lowering champ IP cost by a \"years after release\" scheme instead of 1 champ comes out 1 price goes down, lowering the cost of runes all together or putting them on rotating sale cycles, or something else entirely. They know from their data how hard it is for newcomers to get into the game and that to continue to grow LoL they need to find a way to bring those people back and playing. \n\nI really hope though that it isn't RuneLord Volibear or whatever because for 125k+ IP spent that would seem like a slap in the face personally. I do not purchase chromas to sink my IP, I do not enjoy Volibear, and feel like it wouldn't even remotely come close value wise to the time spent to unlock it but that is for another thread.

I have purchased 129,297 IP worth. I did this with just trying to purchase runes that were in the meta when I purchased them or ones I felt necessary for certain champs. I did not go out of my way to purchase all runes like many others have just for the IP sink. With reductions and other things taken into account I am pushing well over 135K.\n\n\nThat is a ridiculous amount of IP for someone new to the scene to try and gather even if they bought every single champ they wanted with RP. At 250 IP/Game (Win of the Day) for 130K IP is 520 days. Now sure, all of the runes I have are not necessary and Riot has done a good job by making all T2 runes 1IP and 50% price reduction some \"standard\" T3 runes, but that still is a daunting task for any newcomer. \n\n\nThe problem Riot is facing is a very complex one. Runes have been a part of LoL since the beginning - over 7 years. They are one of the things that allowed for customization in how you played a champion. However, if you didn't get in early they now are just an anchor pulling you down and stopping you from grabbing champions you want. There are a vast number of people that like runes (as they are) and don't want them change. There are a vast number of people who want them removed all together. And then there are a vast number of people who want something in the middle or don't care at all. It is going to be hard for Riot to find a balance where all the groups are happy with it and I doubt they will. \n\nRunes are fun but they definitely need price updating if anything or a regular rotating IP sale cycle that if they had started years ago probably wouldn't see as many people pissed about runes as they are now. \n\nRiot needs to find a way to lower the IP cost of getting into the game properly. Be that lowering champ IP cost by a \"years after release\" scheme instead of 1 champ comes out 1 price goes down, lowering the cost of runes all together or putting them on rotating sale cycles, or something else entirely. They know from their data how hard it is for newcomers to get into the game and that to continue to grow LoL they need to find a way to bring those people back and playing. \n\nI really hope though that it isn't RuneLord Volibear or whatever because for 125k+ IP spent that would seem like a slap in the face personally. I do not purchase chromas to sink my IP, I do not enjoy Volibear, and feel like it wouldn't even remotely come close value wise to the time spent to unlock it but that is for another thread.

Arsenal has been around since 1893, and they only need to play soccer, because it's still the most (iirc) popular sport in the world. There's no big sports being invented for people to play every year. \n\nEsports is a lot different, where you see games come and go. StarCraft 2 is a great example, as it is now coming towards the end of it's lifespan. There's been older CS games come and gone, you have the new comers like Overwatch, the same thing will happen to LoL, just as the rest of these games. \n\nB) Players in sports i.e soccer, can have careers lasting from pre-20's to late 30's+ if they stay in form. David Beckham played for 20 years before he retired. \n\nMeanwhile in esports, players usually have much shorter career's where you see players like Hai, xPeke, Weixioa, Reapered, Alex ich, all (except Alex Ich) retiring, after only a handful of years playing the game. Before Faker, Weixioa was considered the best player in the world by many, but his career only lasted 3 years. It's a lot harder for these players to maintain a top position and stay competitive, which is why you see players like Alex Ich, going from top 4 at worlds to fighting in NA relegation. Players don't want to get stuck on a bad team, and teams don't want to get stuck with a player who flunks after a season. \n\nThere's also things like Arsenal is based in a region, so people of that region often become Arsenal fans, much like you cheer for your country at the Olympics. Also if a team in BPL gets relegated, the go into the Championship, which is still viable for them to stay as a business in, where League has the Challenger series, which is in shambles atm. In America there is no relegation, so teams don't have to worry about being kicked down to lower tier competition. There have been a lot of League teams disbanding over the years, which is something you don't really see in Sports.\n\nPretty much, it's a lot less viable for team to sign players for 10 years, when nobody knows if the player will still be good, the team will still exist, or League will even still be a game. ", "id": "daqepnk"}, {"comment": "Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting this alone will fix the way things work, I just think it's one of many steps in the right direction! I do agree with most of your points though. \n\nI feel like over time as Esports grows it will produce more leagues to play in etc, thus resulting in players being able to play for longer, e.g. your Alex Ich's can perhaps play at the top level and finish their careers in the level below (but right now Challenger doesn't offer enough, but let's hope it's improved and becomes desirable). Also with the way things are going I believe the most dedicated players can easily play for 5-8 years, if lower leagues allow 16+ to play and LCS being 18+ (personally I think 16 year olds should be allowed to play regardless) then players have the potential to play from 16-24 for LoL at least, there are a lot of Esports that require less reaction time/mechanics meaning people can play up to age 30 or perhaps older.\n\nEven in actual sports nowadays, top players are able to play for longer due to there being more teams/money resulting in more leagues that are still competitive enough and still pay enough to entice these types of players to carry on their careers at least a few years longer. So while Esports may have a long road ahead, I do believe, as slow as it may be, the potential for longer careers is there.\n\nAlso back to my original point, even with the current 'short careers' players have, I do think at least 2 year contracts should be more common, that's not to say they can't agree on clauses, such as; can transfer/leave upon relegation, can leave if mutually agreed, can leave if 'X' thing has changed and so on.", "id": "daqf6s4"}, {"comment": "I agree with the other poster because like he said things in e-sports change so quickly compared to other sports. In Euro football or NBA there are no patches or meta (or well the  \"meta\" doesn't shift very fast) and you can also deal those players to a wider array of teams via trades or transfers or loans. I agree that 2 years should be more common, its a volatile industry for these guys who skip university or other opportunities and they can get cut and forgotten so fast. I mean for your case we could probably come up with a very, very long list of e-sports players most of Reddit has forgotten even played.", "id": "daqn1ez"}, {"comment": "Yeah, there are players like Bjerg who have the longer contracts, but I don't think it'll get too much longer than a handful of years.\n\nOne of the other issue I would say atm, is if you're signed on a team, you're pretty much one of 5 starters, or a sub who never plays, which is fairly different from sports.\n\nIf you're on the starting LCS line-up, then the team is going to want on-form, top players, who work well within the team and are at least decent in the current meta. I think this kind of entices teams to trade more often, as each individual player seems a lot more important in esports like LoL, than in sports like soccer. In soccer, you often have a 20+ man squads, which often rotate the starting XI week to week, 3 subs during each game, and players even share the roles between them (like have mutliple defenders/midfielders/attackers), putting less emphasis on one specific player. There's no huge meta changes players adapt to, and the skill variance between players isn't as important as LoL.\n\nThen for subs, nobody want's to be the sub who doesn't play the entire season, so the subs are usually people who have retired, and are there just in case (like Regi being a sub for TSM), or they're aspiring players who haven't got much experience, and aren't considered top players. Top players who could have a starting spot in another team, usually won't stay as a sub (it's why Easyhoon left SKT, Pobelter left CLG), otherwise it's felt as a waste of their short careers at the top level, which is why subs are so under used. \n\nAlso on a shorter note, Overwatch League is hoping to have at least some of their franchises be location based, (i.e Dallas Cowboys), which gives fans a separate reason to be passionate about certain teams other than players which I think is a cool idea to help solve this issue.", "id": "darlnpn"}, {"comment": "Couldn't have said it any better because there is no chance to develop people that have potential. Unless you have a big lead in LCS you are usually unwilling to risk almost any match. I remember when TSM tried to do it with Keith but it only lasted a week. Another thing that completely destroyed this was the use of sister teams. I mean look at SKT K & S and Samsung White & Blue. Korea would 100% still be ahead but if those two teams weren't able to do what we are talking about (before the rule was implemented) would the last 4 years look this dominant? If I remember correctly SKT just basically combined the best 3 of both those teams (fact check me but I think it was 3 and 3) and SSW took PawN and gave SSB Dade. That leaves me to think that those two organizations might have possibly been taken over by other Korean ones given that the initial rosters weren't nearly as strong. Not to mention they got to exclusively scrim each other and develop much faster without as much threat to their jobs. I completely understand why the rule was implemented but it just goes to show how the 2 teams that took complete advantage of it were the most dominant teams of that period. Without that Faker could have been in a position like Bjergsen is right now and not have the chemistry/talent that he needed with his original team. \n\nOn a side note: I just realized how hard the sister team rule hit Samsung and how bad they were versus how well they recovered this year.

Injuries aren't exactly related to that.\n\nAlso, Elliot is running up a storm, already at ~1300 or something yards, and the Cowboys are among the top 2 in the league in average yards run per game. If you don't need a pass game, have a rookie QB, and toss it together with RB having a career (for the entire league) season, you don't need to overdue it with throwing to an injured receiver a ton to pad his stats and risk further injury. \n\nI just looked, and Elliot is #1 in the league by a very large margin, with his 1285 yards. 2nd place in the league is 1043, #3 is 921.

His all ins are terrifying for most champs to deal with and he can go for them quite often.

", "id": "daqvppm"}, {"comment": "Hey, got any tips or guides for him? Renek main here too, and I'm looking at expanding my top lane champ pool a bit. I've considered Kled but I have no idea where to start with rotations, playstyle, match-ups, builds, teamfighting etc. ", "id": "daqt6ud"}, {"comment": "Skill level is R>Q>W>E. Build order is usually something like Tiamat > BC > Titanic > Tank. Obviously you can tech in like a hexdrinker vs a Rumble or something, but generally, this is how I build. I don't rush Tiamat on Renek, but I do on Kled because his waveclear is horrible without it. You can get shoved in super hard and have to farm under turret without it. \n\nAs for playstyle, if you see a cooldown window, go for it. Kled usually outdamages basically everyone, and abusing a cooldown window means that you can either commit to the all in, or just take a really good trade and dip because they can't trade back. You'll need to play a few games of Kled to get a feel on how much damage you do, though. In a 1v1, if they just forced you off Skaarl, don't be afraid of keep slugging it out. Because if that's the case, usually it means they blew cooldowns on killing Skaarl, and don't have cooldowns up to finish you, and as you smack them and regain Skaarl, that wins you the fight. \n\nI don't take TP on Kled, or Renek. I really like exhaust on Kled. The slow is helpful on landing the second part of mounted Q, and using exhaust after they dismounted you means that you can usually smack them for courage back without much fear. And with your ult being a semi-global, it's not that bad. Something I really like to do on Kled as that as soon as I'm 6, when I base, I try to go for a 4 man or 5 man bottom and dive their botlane, and take first turret gold. Sometimes it means losing top tower, but we'll get bot tower first, so trading one tower for first tower, ~2 kills, and dragon is pretty worth. Whenever ult is up after that, run down mid, or run up top and kill laner. \n\nAs for skill rotation it's really easy. Fish for a Q. If it lands, E in and start smacking them with your W up. If you want to disengage afterwards, stand between them and their turret, and the second E will put you through them away from their turret. If you are all inning, wait to use second E until they gained some distance. Also, your W is a lot of damage. If you don't have W up, you're usually not going to win trades. So to keep the threat of your W up, sometimes you have to CS with your Q or Tiamat. Runes I go AD reds, armor yellows, MR/lvl blues, AS Quints. Obviously you can change into HP, HP/lvl, flat MR, or even CDR as lane matchups go. Masteries I go 18/0/12 Fervor. ", "id": "daqvf9s"}, {"comment": "You dont rush tiamat on renek?

No need to double up for a massive shield that doesn't actually matter because it'll time out before it'll be broken anyhow.

The best build that I have found (courtesy of Chunky, the only high elo Kled main I know of) is full damage. Cleaver>Ghostblade(probably not as good since the Lethality change, but still OK)>Ravenous is your core and then you can get situational items like Maw/Steraks/GA. Play him extremely aggressive with ignite in the top lane. People in this thread are saying he is weak in lane which is just objectively untrue. His all ins are terrifying for most champs to deal with and he can go for them quite often. When you get an advantage, try to snowball it to other lanes by using your ult to dive mid/bot (remember that when you hop off of Skarl you reset tower aggro) and generally play him as a splitpushing duelist like Fiora in the midgame.

Out of the several real sources you cite, I don't see how any of them support what you are writing, as you are jumping to your own conclusions. \n\nYou seem to be mashing a smorgasbord of things together, from your own imagination to the ramblings of other cooks. The gist of it seems to be some sort of combination of hypnotism and heart math, the latter of which is a verifiable pseudoscience.\n\nTaken from https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ :\n\n>Weaving in some actual science is also a common ploy of pseudoscience. The best lies have a kernel of truth at their center. For example, in the documentary linked to above we are told that the heart generates the largest electromagnetic field of anything in the body. This is mostly true, because the heart is regulated by an internal electrical system and muscles in general are electrical tissue. The heart puts out the largest signal while the body is at rest. When engaging in physical activity, the muscles put out large amounts of electrical signals as well on the same order of magnitude as the heart. But all of this has nothing to do with the claims of Heartmath and coherence \u2013 it\u2019s just a science factoid used to make it seem as if the energy medicine claims are based on science when they aren\u2019t.\n\n>The documentary goes on to say that the pulse (what they are measuring with their emWave) is not a result of blood flow but of an energy wave from the heart. This is patently false \u2013 the pulse can be interrupted by blocking blood flow. But this bit of error is necessary for the Heartmath construct \u2013 that their emWave is not simply a pulse meter prone to noise, but is measuring energy from the heart that is magically communicating to the brain and the rest of the body. They start with a trueish but irrelevant fact, then leap off the cliff.\n\n>Conclusion:\n\n>For many pseudosciences, when you dig down to the core of their claims you will find there either nothing, or simply noise \u2013 some source of random or artifactual signals that generate data to feed into the predetermined conclusions of the pseudoscience. Energy medicine in general, and Heartmath in particular, are excellent examples of this phenomenon.\n\n>What you do not find are rigorous scientific studies that are designed to test the core premises of the pseudoscience \u2013 designed so that they are capable of disproving their premises or distinguishing the new effect they are claiming from existing known effects. In other words \u2013 you will not find any actual science, just the \u201ccheap imitation\u201d of cargo-cult, tooth fairy science.\"\n\nFYI, in real published papers, there are markers next to paragraphs which make factual assertions linking to a specific supporting source (preferably several), often to a specific section in the source.

It's simple really, you make it irresistible. Because it\u2019s wery, wery, wery, wery, wery, wery hard to not communicate with the unconscious mind: you simply bypass the critical factor directly through the use of symbols and communicate with the unconscious mind, the players have no clue what\u2019s happening, they just enjoy the ride. In the west thinking is a very overused and misunderstood tool. This is why the following quote applies here in more than one way: \u201cOur scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.\u201d - Martin Luther King, Jr.\nNo longer you ask: will the player like or not like the game, he simply will.

It\u2019s kind of like wine tasting really.\n\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/batman-arkham-city/reviews/ It goes like this almost for every recent major batman releas. I mean also why do people like Skyrim, Witcher lll, especial \u201cBlood and Whine\u201d? Campbell's hero journey put together with psychology and Jung's work. Also what do you feel when this clip from Witcher rolls by? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgD-PQGtu80&t=1m3s \n\n\nThe answer to your question is: The unconscious mind does everything that you don\u2019t need to think about for you. Now you understand why BSH course is so strong, because part of it shows how to automate stuff so you don\u2019t need to think about it conciously, when you do that you have less and less bits of information that you need to track with attention consciously as you play. It allows for a more easy transition into \u201cbattle trance\u201d.  \n\n\nSome of the things you don\u2019t need to think about consciously to do them - World class story telling, breathing, clicking with mouse, walking\u2026 \n\n\nThen there\u2019s the good old question - Why is the table in front of you more table-like than the PC sitting on it? Or why dose your particular table possesses a higher level of table-like properties than other tables you have encountered before. A different continuation of this is - Why is x not y? Can you make it so that x becomes y in terms of the symbolic representation it brings? Turns out you can, that\u2019s one part of what suggestions are about\u2026\n\n\n... because of symbolic representations... \nThe following is an excerpt from Jung - Man and His Symbols\n\n\n\u201cIt would be an impertinence on my part to attempt to interpret\nJung's work to readers, many of whom will surely be far better qualified\nto understand it than I am. My role, remember, was merely to\nserve as a sort of \"intelligibility filter\" and by no means as an interpreter.\nNevertheless, I venture to offer two general points that seem\nimportant to me as a layman and that may possibly be helpful to other\nnon-experts. The first is about dreams. To Jungians the dream is not a\nkind of standardized cryptogram that can be decoded by a glossary\nof symbol meanings. It is an integral, important, and personal expression\nof the individual unconscious. It is just as \"real\" as any other\nphenomenon attaching to the individual. The, dreamer's individual\nunconscious is communicating with the dreamer alone and is selecting\nsymbols for its purpose that have meaning to the dreamer and to\nnobody else. Thus the interpretation of dreams, whether by the analyst\nor by the dreamer himself, is for the Jungian psychologist an entirely\npersonal and individual business (and sometimes an experimental and\nvery lengthy one as well) that can by no means be undertaken by\nrule of thumb.\nThe converse of this is that the communications of the unconscious\nare of the highest importance to the dreamer\u2014naturally so, since the\nunconscious is at least half of his total being\u2014and frequently offer him\nadvice or guidance that could be obtained from no other source. Thus,\nwhen I described Jung's dream about addressing the multitude, I was\nnot describing a piece of magic or suggesting that Jung dabbled in\nfortune telling. I was recounting in the simple terms of daily experience\nhow Jung was \"advised\" by his own unconscious to reconsider an\ninadequate judgment he had made with the conscious part of his mind.\nNow it follows from this that the dreaming of dreams is not a matter\nthat the well-adjusted Jungian can regard as simply a matter of\nchance. On the contrary, the ability to establish communications with\nthe unconscious is a part of the whole man, and Jungians \"teach\"\nthemselves (I can think of no better term) to be receptive to dreams.\nWhen, therefore, Jung himself 1 was faced with the critical decision\nwhether or not to write this book, he was able to draw on the resources\nof both his conscious and his unconscious in making up his mind. And\nall through this book you will find the dream treated as a direct, personal,\nand meaningful communication to the dreamer \u2014a communication\nthat uses the symbols common to ajl mankind, but that uses them\non every occasion in an entirely individual way that can be interpreted\nonly by an entirely individual \"key.\"\" - page 12\n\nThe conscious mind reasons through logic. \nThe unconscious mind reasons and communicates through symbolism and symbols.", "id": "darmv88"}]]], "5ga88q": ["In around 2 hours, the finals in Danish Master League will take place!", "2016-12-03 19:14:19", 15, "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5ga88q/in_around_2_hours_the_finals_in_danish_master/", [[2, " #lcsdk\n"], [1, "J\u00c4VLA DANSKAR"], [1, "Tricked is stacked in this tournament.\nNeegodbro (previously Copenhagenwolves and NIP), MrRallez, Atom (previously Giants gaming) and Broxah (currently on FNC challenger, also took part in s04 tryouts and has been in some other good up and coming teams).
