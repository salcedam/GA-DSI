ALL ABOARD THE TRAINHARDT !", "2016-12-03 14:13:55", 1000, "https://youtu.be/F9MwGCby2qE?t=8", [[81, "RIP Teleporter"], [47, "Cool video!  But it looks like Youtube's compression really butchered your video quality.  I hate to see so many hours of work hurt by bad compression.\n\nIf you want to get the best possible export of game footage for Youtube try to export using these parameters (Assuming Premiere exporter):\n\n* Format: Quicktime\n* ANIMATION Codec (not H264, as it butchers game footage in areas that have similar colors with tons of compression artifacts)\n* W/H: 1920x1080\n* Framerate: 60\n* Field Order: Progressive\n* Aspect: Square pixels\n* Render depth 24bit\n* Tick Use Maximum Render Quality\n* Tick Optimize Stills\n\nThis will give you a .mov that is enormous but you can upload that to Youtube as long as it's under 128GB and Youtube's compression won't totally destroy your quality.  Also .mov formats don't seem to get out of sync with audio/video as badly as .mp4s exported through H264 codec.\n\nOf course, footage that's already compressed slightly (say from Shadowplay or other compressed capture tools) will already be compressed a bit.  This makes the render out from your editing software a 2nd round of compression, and the upload to Youtube a 3rd round compression.  So your final video on Youtube is triple compressed footage and starts to look like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos).  Using OBS to capture footage at lossless settings is your best bet for same system capture (assuming it doesn't drop your FPS below 60 for playing.)  Otherwise a HDMI capture card (Elgato, blackmagic pro) attached to another computer can get you 100% uncompressed raw footage. \n\nIf you are forced to use H264 (for really long videos, low HDD space, or slow upload), try to set the bitrate to give you a video that the highest quality but still under Youtube's size limits ([Youtube upload recs](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1722171?hl=en)):\n\nSettings for that export are:\n\n* Format: Quicktime\n* H264 (with a frown)\n* Quality: 100%\n* W/H: 1920x1080\n* Framerate: 60\n* Field Order: Progressive\n* Aspect: Square pixels\n* Tick Render at Maximum Depth\n* Tick Optimize Stills\n* This last setting is where it gets tricky.  Tick the \"Limit data rate to\" button and set your datarate to something ridiculous. Youtube's current max datarate is 68mbps (usually reserved for 4k videos at 60hz) - but with a video like this you can crank it way up to 68,000 kbps (68mbps) and just be sure to watch that the \"Estimated file size\" doesn't go over 128gb (127,000 MB in the \"estimated file size\" area)\n\nThese kind of output settings will guarantee that Youtube starts with the best possibly quality before compressing your stuff.  This will cost you HDD space, rendering time, and upload time but the final result is much much better!\n\nOh god I typed a lot of words.  \n\nTLDR; You want to upload a video to Youtube as close to uncompressed footage as possible as Youtube will aggressively compress anything you give it.\n\n"], [34, "I usually don't watch videos that long.

Had to go through all the voice lines of Rein and Mercy to make that custom dialogue, added sound effects of connection instability, radio sound effect of mercy, the overlay HUD shakes and glitches as well as finding one first, finding one took me over an hour. \n\nThere is a lot of research of memes and new effects I needed to use in order to make my video. Like that XBox achievement pop-up, couldnt find a clean animation of bar opening up so I had to make it myself, or Reinhardt riding a skateboard, had to go in game and take several screenshots to find a good pose then cropped his arm in from another pose and then added the skateboard and did the totally legit animation that sony vegas provides (lol).\n\nHate to be so defensive, just giving you an eye opener to how much is going on behind the scenes. Thanks for watching, I hope you enjoyed it !\n\nP.S 127 Hours is a reference to the movie, because that's what editing this felt like.

It's what I do on a daily basis. And let me tell you that all the things you listed do not even make it close a 100+ hours.\n\nSifting trough voice lines can be easily done if you archive them correctly, sound effects of connection instability etc can either be easily made in a ( free ) program like audacity, or audition ( which is not free ) or bought online. The overlay animation takes time granted, though the glitch effect can be saved as a preset and reused with only slight changes, so that doesn't take very long. Add some random wiggle and we're already done.\n\nResearch on memes? Sure, but I do not qualify this as editing.\n\nThe Xbox achievement pop-up is very minimal and can easily be made with only a few shapes and masks!\n\nOnce again animating the skating scene would take time, nothing to say about that!\n\nThis was definitely not an eye opener, I am very aware of how much time editing takes.\n\nbut what I saw in this video does not justify over a 100 hours of editing.\n\n\nWhether it's poor a poor workflow, or just inexperience I do not know, judging from the video I'd say you do know what you are doing. Then again Sony Vegas can be  a bitch to work with IMO so there's that.\n\nLet me end this wall of text by saying that I'm not trying to criticize the video or your editing skills.

All I'm trying to say is that 100+ hours for this video is just too much.", "id": "daqqlr0"}, {"comment": "I could write you a list of edits and fixes I had to make in each scene, but that would take ages.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "daqgwce"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the help but I fixed it myself before you showed up.

I would argue that is at least somewhat constructive. Maybe not the dick sucking part, unless that, in actual fact, is what she was doing. But the person communicated he needed healing. The Mercy player can work with that information. \n\nWhat I absolutely despise is when someone pipes up in comp, not to call targets, not to point out a counter, but purely just to smack talk, but with a smugness that makes them sound like they actually think they're helping.  My (least) favourite which triggers me every time without fail is when a healer says something along the lines of \"our DPS need to get some kills\".  This is toxic af. It doesn't need to be racist or offensive or a direct attack to be toxic. This is not how to encourage your team. You have given absolutely nothing constructive to work with, nothing whatsoever. All you have done with that statement is likely made a frustrated DPS even more frustrated. If you think they're underperforming, maybe they are, so say you're switching to dps and we're going to be a healer down. Or suggest who they switch to. Suggest a solution. Or identify a problem that has a solution beyond \"git gud scrub\".\n\nI am a passionate person, I have a mouth like a sailor, I'm Scottish and I worked as a chef for many years.  Needless to say, the words I use might not be to everyone's liking, but the message is at least constructive.\n\nLast night I was on def in Route 66. We had one tank. Myself as Zenyatta and 2 dps were peeking at a corner, waiting on the tank returning from spawn to make a play. Then I spot him solo flanking, obviously with some tunnel vision. So I unleashed a very toxic sounding comment in voice chat. For the benefit of the children in the audience I will redact all of the expletives.\n\n\"What the XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX are you XXXXXXXXXXXXXX doing XXXXXXXXXXXXX flanking, you total XXXXXXXXXXXXXX, you are our only XXXXXXXXXXXXX tank, if you're not on the XXXXXXXXXXXX objective with the team then we don't have a XXXXXXXXXXX tank, just a fat XXXXXXXXXX Genji. Stay with the XXXXXXXXXXX team or I will switch to tank, then you'll be down a healer.\"\n\nNow. He really didn't like being called a XXXXXXXXX. But the message, while lengthy, was constructive, his tunnel vision widened, we regrouped, we won. Had I given him non-constructive feedback or criticism, called him a noob and left it at that, it likely would have had the opposite effect.\n\nSo, what I'm saying is. That may have been me that told Mercy to stop sucking dick and heal me that time. The dick sucking part is just my personality (pls dont quote me on that). That's how I talk to my best friends.

Each hero does quite different things. It's not like Super Smash Bros. (which is a great game, I'm just using it to illustrate my point) where every character's focus is getting kills, or COD (another great game, IMO). In OW, there is a different \"minigame\" for everyone. Playing as Mercy is a vastly different experience from playing Genji, which is vastly different from playing Reinhardt, etc. There are so many ways to play the game that almost anyone who picks it up will find a hero they resonate with. \n\nYes, I realize it is one game. But playing different OW heroes is not like choosing different guns in COD, nor is it like choosing different characters in SSB. The difference in experience between the options of those games is really only one of *species* or *type*. But in Overwatch, every hero presents a different *kind* of experience. That's what makes this game so special. Even without single player options, the diversity of game experiences is enormous. And the best part is that Overwatch ties those individual experiences together extremely well under a teamwork framework.\n\nThe point is that OW's gameplay can accomodate numerous kinds of players. You don't need to be a fragaholic like in COD or SSB (to the extent that getting kills is your goal). \n\nI'd even wager to say that if you watched one character or gun class played on SSB or COD, you could infer generally how the game is played without much fault, if at all. But that does not apply to Overwatch. If you sat and watched Genji gameplay of your roommate for the first time, you'd have practically no idea what it would be like to play Mercy. You couldn't really come up with an inference as to \"how the game is played\" because there are so many wholly-different *kinds* of ways to play- not just gradated species of a single way.\n\nSorry, it's kind of difficult to explain what I mean, but I hope I made my point. The bottom line is that OW necessarily has the potential for wider appeal than other FPS multiplayer games that present variations on a single way of playing. Add in the appeal of a diverse cast with varying personality quirks and aesthetic appeal, and you have yourself a game that almost anyone can come to enjoy.\n\nI'm not really big on the \"look at the free DLC/etc. we get\" argument, mainly because that was a marketing tactic to pull people away from the paid-DLC fury of other games and get people to play the game.

Then quietly removing that listed promise.\nLets also not forget that these heroes and new maps were part of the sale, they were part of the pitch. That was a selling point.

I also agree with a lot of the comments in regards to you being a little rash in your statements. \n\nThe only point that I really want to counter specifically is: \n>If game developers are smart, they will follow suit and stop being so greedy/lazy.\n\nI think you mean to say, \"If game developing business partners...\". Using only the phrase \"game developers\" makes the assumption that you are referring to the software developers for that game. As a software developer, I understand that the ultimate decision of what to / not develop doesn't come down to me. I can only present the estimation to build, risks, and my guess of a return. The \"business\" then decides what to develop / not. Even with smaller startup games where a software developer might be making these decisions, he is still acting on behalf of the businesses best interest and not the developers / community. \n\nI feel like it's important to make this distinction at a time in gaming where the community is having more and more involvement with the developers directly. Developers should focus on what the community is asking for and provide these details to the business. One must also understand that things that seem \"trivial\" to develop, might be next to impossible giving the current architecture of the underlying system. \n\nTake for example a video game that requires user names to be unique, but the community asks for duplication of user names to be allowed (only in the context of in game). This might seem like \"okay, so just allow users to put in the same name\", but if the system currently makes the assumption that all username will be unique, then this requires a rework of nearly everything related to \"getting\" / \"updating\" / \"using\" a user. \n\nThe main reason I'm wanting to say all this is to remind this community and others that the software developers are actually always on your side. They want to make the best and biggest thing possible, but they aren't always given these opportunities by their businesses. Developers can not change the resources they have allotted to them. Acting frustrated / angry towards the developers will never get you anything positive, but rather it could harm the willingness of the developers to maintain a strong relationship with it's community. If you're always being yelled at for things you can't control, why would you go back to read anyone's opinions?\n\nTL;DR: Yay Overwatch!

Each hero does quite different things. It's not like Super Smash Bros. (which is a great game, I'm just using it to illustrate my point) where every character's focus is getting kills, or COD (another great game, IMO). In OW, there is a different \"minigame\" for everyone. Playing as Mercy is a vastly different experience from playing Genji, which is vastly different from playing Reinhardt, etc. There are so many ways to play the game that almost anyone who picks it up will find a hero they resonate with. \n\nYes, I realize it is one game. But playing different OW heroes is not like choosing different guns in COD, nor is it like choosing different characters in SSB. The difference in experience between the options of those games is really only one of *species* or *type*. But in Overwatch, every hero presents a different *kind* of experience. That's what makes this game so special. Even without single player options, the diversity of game experiences is enormous. And the best part is that Overwatch ties those individual experiences together extremely well under a teamwork framework.\n\nThe point is that OW's gameplay can accomodate numerous kinds of players. You don't need to be a fragaholic like in COD or SSB (to the extent that getting kills is your goal). \n\nI'd even wager to say that if you watched one character or gun class played on SSB or COD, you could infer generally how the game is played without much fault, if at all. But that does not apply to Overwatch. If you sat and watched Genji gameplay of your roommate for the first time, you'd have practically no idea what it would be like to play Mercy. You couldn't really come up with an inference as to \"how the game is played\" because there are so many wholly-different *kinds* of ways to play- not just gradated species of a single way.\n\nSorry, it's kind of difficult to explain what I mean, but I hope I made my point. The bottom line is that OW necessarily has the potential for wider appeal than other FPS multiplayer games that present variations on a single way of playing. Add in the appeal of a diverse cast with varying personality quirks and aesthetic appeal, and you have yourself a game that almost anyone can come to enjoy.\n\nI'm not really big on the \"look at the free DLC/etc. we get\" argument, mainly because that was a marketing tactic to pull people away from the paid-DLC fury of other games and get people to play the game.

I also agree with a lot of the comments in regards to you being a little rash in your statements. \n\nThe only point that I really want to counter specifically is: \n>If game developers are smart, they will follow suit and stop being so greedy/lazy.\n\nI think you mean to say, \"If game developing business partners...\". Using only the phrase \"game developers\" makes the assumption that you are referring to the software developers for that game. As a software developer, I understand that the ultimate decision of what to / not develop doesn't come down to me. I can only present the estimation to build, risks, and my guess of a return. The \"business\" then decides what to develop / not. Even with smaller startup games where a software developer might be making these decisions, he is still acting on behalf of the businesses best interest and not the developers / community. \n\nI feel like it's important to make this distinction at a time in gaming where the community is having more and more involvement with the developers directly. Developers should focus on what the community is asking for and provide these details to the business. One must also understand that things that seem \"trivial\" to develop, might be next to impossible giving the current architecture of the underlying system. \n\nTake for example a video game that requires user names to be unique, but the community asks for duplication of user names to be allowed (only in the context of in game). This might seem like \"okay, so just allow users to put in the same name\", but if the system currently makes the assumption that all username will be unique, then this requires a rework of nearly everything related to \"getting\" / \"updating\" / \"using\" a user. \n\nThe main reason I'm wanting to say all this is to remind this community and others that the software developers are actually always on your side. They want to make the best and biggest thing possible, but they aren't always given these opportunities by their businesses. Developers can not change the resources they have allotted to them. Acting frustrated / angry towards the developers will never get you anything positive, but rather it could harm the willingness of the developers to maintain a strong relationship with it's community. If you're always being yelled at for things you can't control, why would you go back to read anyone's opinions?\n\nTL;DR: Yay Overwatch!

You would have to aim away from objects and catch your target with the edge of the hook, otherwise it would bounce.\n\nIf the game were still in dev where stuff could be altered it would be one thing, but imagine the hook being useless in a room because some small (otherwise cosmetic) lamp/table/etc. triggers the collision.

Whether or not his personal potential would be higher on another hero is irrelevant. He could be a prodigy at baseball too, yet his skill rating is being calibrated based on his performance as Symmetra. \n\nSince there is undoubtedly advantage to be gained from choosing different heroes under different circumstances, for anyone to perform well while limiting their hero selection severely means their ability must overcome this disadvantage. It is also likely their performance will be subject to more variation than it is for those with more flexibility. \n\nI can understand the negativity associated with that sort of uncertainty. A caricature example would be the widowmaker on your team who either dominates and carries, or is utterly useless. Of course, we are also more likely to remember the extreme cases and those that validate our expectations (\"see? widows are always useless\", or \"this guy got some lucky shots\" and \"wow widow god, wish the rest 90% were as useful\"). \n\nOf course, there are many sources of variation and uncertainty in the game, and fixating on one is unlikely to be helpful. At the end of the day, the blame game will always only hurt your chances of winning, and as such the best thing you can do for your own game is to accept the reality that some people will prioritize a certain playstyle over the potential that could be gained by diversifying.

Yes, there's a ton of factors as to how he got to Masters and how close the matches were.\n\nUltimately, everything he does from his hero picks to positioning, mechanical execution, co-ordination etc. will be reflected in his win rate, and as such the skill rating. \n\nI suspect that the vast majority of people who \"main\" a single hero are in the lower brackets because of the disproportional amount of compensation needed to perform well reliably. The \"mains\" you see in the higher skill brackets are largely outliers; specialists that have learned to work around the drawbacks in their heroes' toolkits. \n\nFor those who employ a larger variety of heroes, these drawbacks would often be a more severe hindrance and as such the impact of the hero pick between the specialist and generalist cannot be fairly equated. As such, as long as someone's skill rating is based on their specialization, they are not disadvantaging their team and the reduced enjoyment of the game is largely borne out of lack of undertanding and acceptance (and the resulting self-tilting) of the specialist perspective. \n\nAs the system's goal is perfectly balanced teams that have equal likelihood of winning, it will approximate every player's skill rating (competitive SR as well as the hidden MMR) in such a way that will statistically approach a 50% W:L ratio. So, if you see a specialist on your team, check their win rate on their chosen hero. If the sample size is large enough to be representative and the rate is close to 50%, they are where they are supposed to be. If it's >50%, you should count yourself lucky. If it's significantly under 50%, then they are literally overrated (this could be due to luck, being carried, low sample size etc.) and it is possible their rating is largely not based on that hero and they are instead a generalist (or has only more recently chosen to become a specialist). In such a scenario there is more legitimacy for criticism, and that person is likely to fall if they persist in their strategy (you might want to check if they are grouped with someone who is possibly carrying them, though).\n\nIn any case, it is of course somewhat complicated and I would agree with the basic principle that encouraging at least some degree of diversity in hero picks is good -- for many heroes, mechanical skill can transfer over to similar heroes. Constructive efforts to get people to switch are fine (just don't get too hung up if they don't always bear fruit, which is inevitable).\n\n", "id": "darczg3"}, {"comment": "what he's doing is a joke\n\nbasically he's just playing symmetra only for season 3 and proving that any hero is good in the right hands", "id": "dar725m"}, {"comment": "That's not true tho, first of all not every hero is good, it's normal, it's the tricky part of balancing, some will be good some will be less good. \n\nSecond of all refusing to switch when a pick is clearly not adapted to what your facing is a reportable offense for sure, not a joke. playing only symmetra to masters should not be something you're proud of, cause in all of his losses he ruined the game for 5 other people, and for what, to \"prove a point\" ?

I usually get silver damage with symmetra, even on attack.\n\nI know you don't want to hear this, but gold/silver damage in isolation means nothing at all. The reality is you might be getting gold/silver *at the expense of your team.*\n\nI used the Ana example before, I'll use it again. If the team is running 1 healer because of you, that probably means it's not Ana. If it's not Ana, that means Soldier/Genji/Reaper have no nano boost. If they have no nano boost, that means *their* numbers are going to be lower than they could be... *because of you.* You're the thing that stood in the way of there being an Ana in the game. So the question isn't \"do you have silver damage?\" it's \"does your silver damage make up for what your team would have had if you had been replaced by a competent XYZ?\" Let's say you did 10k damage, well maybe Ana's Nano Boosts would have given Soldier/Reaper/Genji a lot of the damage you did, she would have done some damage on her own, she would have slept some enemy ults, and she would have given them consistent healing on top of that. So in that case, the answer is no. \n\nFor another example of how deceptive numbers can be, look at Reinhardt. Give Rein a team of Tracer, Genji, Widow, Hanzo, and Reaper and he can have 50,000 damage blocked *but it doesn't matter one bit* because none of his teammates were behind his shield taking advantage of it. In the case of your games as Symmetra, your good numbers might lead you to assume you're pulling your weight when you're actually getting in the way of your teammates performing to their peak potential. \n\n> A well placed teleporter can shave 15 seconds per person on the respawn.\n\nAnd sometimes you run out of teleports just as a key member of the team respawns, and all 5 of you who had teleports have to sit around and wait for that 6th to come back anyway, and that teleporter won you nothing at all. Tell me that's never happened to you. \n\nAnd maybe a part of that is your teammates' fault. Maybe they're not used to playing smart with a teleporter. But looking at the big picture, most of us never play with Symmetra for good reason, you expect us to learn how to in a 10 minute game while we're trying to win? Not likely.\n\n> My beam locks onto targets therefore I win 95% of fights against genji, lucio, mercy, anna, zen, sombra and sometimes tracer. \n\nWhat if the enemy team doesn't have a Genji or Sombra, but a Pharah and Roadhog?

Starting last season, League uses a system where you select two roles (out of the game's 5) and will usually get one of these two unless you're autofilled (placed in another role so the queue times don't get excessively long). Since support is played by only a handful of players, most of the times if you're autofilled you're going support, and putting support as one of your two roles will drastically reduce queue times but you'll most likely end up supporting.\n\n- Supports lane with an ADC in bot lane, so they'll be 2v2'ing for the first stages of the game. An ADC's autonomy and general power early on can vary a lot and a single ADC usually won't be able to hold the fort against the enemy ADC and support.\n\nWhat the Singed player did was queue as support so that he could have low queue times and then he would threaten going Singed support with smite if his team didn't let him play top lane(Singed's most common role). Using Smite(a spell meant to help clear the jungle) he would spend the entire game annoying the enemy jungler, leaving his ADC alone against 2 enemies. He had a sub 30% winrate doing this but since he usually won the games he went top (either because he got the role or someone else went support) his winrate with the champion was still positive.\n\nHowever, /r/leagueoflegends is remarkably prone to circlejerking and trends so when it came to light that this Singed \"support\" main was threatened with a ban, several people began defending him without knowing the full story and criticizing Riot without a clue what they were talking about (like the original poster I replied to). Some people have an erroneous idea that Singed support with smite somehow works and claims the guy is a victim of some sort. Keep in mind, the guy's gold, which while being a fairly small % of League players is still not an impressive rank.\n\nIn short, he queued as support simply for shorter queues and would then abandon his ADC outright and neglect his team in favor of his \"strategy\", which was little more than an attempt to not go support in the first place by forcing one of his teammates to switch with him, instead of supporting. \n\nApologies for posting this on the Overwatch sub, I rarely post here, but think defending a troll out of ignorance is a rather absurd thing to do.\n\n", "id": "dard9b8"}, {"comment": "> Not sure if you ever played League before\n\nI didn't but thanks for a detailed explanation!", "id": "darqfnd"}, {"comment": "Please don't bring this to the overwatch sub", "id": "dar6frh"}], [{"comment": "what is your gamertag so I can report you, and this post?  what a troll.", "id": "dar84r5"}]]], "5gf0a1": ["impeccable timing", "2016-12-04 14:14:07", 3, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvkcsd3mw9k", [], []], "5g9d0b": ["When years of jarate throwing pays off.", "2016-12-03 15:32:50", 2728, "https://gfycat.com/AridDrearyAiredale", [[355, "MON DIEU"], [341, "soooo, does Ana have the Sydney sleeper?"], [187, "\"Aah, piss\""], [145, "Piece of piss"], [92, "\"Heads up!\""], [91, "\"Everything above your neck is going to be a fine red mist!\""], [72, "Oh no!

She is now a legitimate threat to consider rather than supports simply healing through the splash.\n\nFor those of who are fairly proficient with her however, it may not be quite as huge as we're more reliably hitting our targets dead on (or very nearly) anyway, but it's a definitive bonus. It also allows us to have a slightly better fighting chance against characters who can empty a clip into a flying Pharah faster than she can return fire.\n\nEDIT: Corrected Pharah's damage numbers.

What she doesn\u2019t specify is how MANY months. Her Chronal Accelerator allows her to control her own time, but where was she in those missing months? \n\n\nI believe that she may have traveled back in time, before her own birth. Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking, how could I know this? Well friend, I\u2019ll tell you:\n\n\nSHE WEARS CROCS, CLEARLY A REMNANT OF THE PAST. \n\n\nTracer\u2019s shoes are her only memento of her time in the past, thus why she refused to change them despite the rest of her team (most likely) begging her to. But why, you ask, would she be wearing crocs? How does that connect to anything? Well amigo, I\u2019ll get you an answer for that too.\n\n\nTracer had to have gone back in time to before her own birth to attain her fancy footwear, as nobody else in the cast wears such out of date shoes (Sombra is lying about her age probably maybe so she doesn\u2019t count). What matters to me is HOW far back she went. Tracer is the 7th Overwatch hero in the cast in terms of hero alignment in the Offense group. Thus, it must correlate that Tracer went back seven years before her own birth. What else happened seven years before her birth?\n\n\nWIDOWMAKER WAS BORN.\n\n\nNow what could possibly correlate the two characters? Well, in this photo of the [original Overwatch team](http://www.pcgamesn.com/sites/default/files/original%20overwatch%20crew.jpg), the woman on the far right from our perspective, though not given a name, clearly does not have a light skin tone. Ana, Pharah, and Reaper, even through the filter, seem to have a slightly more natural skin tone than her. Now what color could possibly create what we see through that filter on her? Go ahead, take a guess, I\u2019ll wait.\n\n\nTHE ANSWER IS THAT SHE WAS CLEARLY **PURPLE.**\n\nWidowmaker having purple skin as a result of Talon was clearly a cover story, fabricated to protect her from being attacked as a result of her heritage. But wait, how does that prove that Tracer and Widow are somehow related? Well, acquaintance, I\u2019ll enlighten you:\n\n\nTHEY HAVE THE SAME(ISH) EYE COLOR. YELLOW OR BRIGHT ORANGE OR WHATEVER THE FUCK THAT IS.\n\nAlso, if you look back towards the Tracer \u201cOrigin\u201d video, you\u2019ll find its one minute and fourteen seconds long. Widowmaker\u2019s \u201cAlive\u201d short is six minutes and nineteen seconds long. 1:14 + 6:19 ^booyaka?\n\n\nSEVEN THIRTY-THREE, THE AMOUNT OF YEARS BY WHICH THEIR AGES DIFFER AND WIDOWMAKER\u2019S AGE, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS THE TIME I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND THOUGHT UP THIS BULLSHIT THEORY OVER A BOWL OF CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH.\n\n\nBut, the most damning piece of evidence? Its right there on the globe, my comrade. \n\n\nTracer is British. That means she\u2019s from the United Kingdom. What country is directly below the United Kingdom, as though in a family lineage? Hmm? what was that?

What she doesn\u2019t specify is how MANY months. Her Chronal Accelerator allows her to control her own time, but where was she in those missing months? \n\n\nI believe that she may have traveled back in time, before her own birth. Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking, how could I know this? Well friend, I\u2019ll tell you:\n\n\nSHE WEARS CROCS, CLEARLY A REMNANT OF THE PAST. \n\n\nTracer\u2019s shoes are her only memento of her time in the past, thus why she refused to change them despite the rest of her team (most likely) begging her to. But why, you ask, would she be wearing crocs? How does that connect to anything? Well amigo, I\u2019ll get you an answer for that too.\n\n\nTracer had to have gone back in time to before her own birth to attain her fancy footwear, as nobody else in the cast wears such out of date shoes (Sombra is lying about her age probably maybe so she doesn\u2019t count). What matters to me is HOW far back she went. Tracer is the 7th Overwatch hero in the cast in terms of hero alignment in the Offense group. Thus, it must correlate that Tracer went back seven years before her own birth. What else happened seven years before her birth?\n\n\nWIDOWMAKER WAS BORN.\n\n\nNow what could possibly correlate the two characters? Well, in this photo of the [original Overwatch team](http://www.pcgamesn.com/sites/default/files/original%20overwatch%20crew.jpg), the woman on the far right from our perspective, though not given a name, clearly does not have a light skin tone. Ana, Pharah, and Reaper, even through the filter, seem to have a slightly more natural skin tone than her. Now what color could possibly create what we see through that filter on her? Go ahead, take a guess, I\u2019ll wait.\n\n\nTHE ANSWER IS THAT SHE WAS CLEARLY **PURPLE.**\n\nWidowmaker having purple skin as a result of Talon was clearly a cover story, fabricated to protect her from being attacked as a result of her heritage. But wait, how does that prove that Tracer and Widow are somehow related? Well, acquaintance, I\u2019ll enlighten you:\n\n\nTHEY HAVE THE SAME(ISH) EYE COLOR. YELLOW OR BRIGHT ORANGE OR WHATEVER THE FUCK THAT IS.\n\nAlso, if you look back towards the Tracer \u201cOrigin\u201d video, you\u2019ll find its one minute and fourteen seconds long. Widowmaker\u2019s \u201cAlive\u201d short is six minutes and nineteen seconds long. 1:14 + 6:19 ^booyaka?\n\n\nSEVEN THIRTY-THREE, THE AMOUNT OF YEARS BY WHICH THEIR AGES DIFFER AND WIDOWMAKER\u2019S AGE, RESPECTIVELY, AS WELL AS THE TIME I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND THOUGHT UP THIS BULLSHIT THEORY OVER A BOWL OF CINNAMON TOAST CRUNCH.\n\n\nBut, the most damning piece of evidence? Its right there on the globe, my comrade. \n\n\nTracer is British. That means she\u2019s from the United Kingdom. What country is directly below the United Kingdom, as though in a family lineage? Hmm? what was that? Oh that\u2019s right,\n\n\n##**IT\u2019S FRANCE**\n\n\n**TRACER IS WIDOWMAKER\u2019S MOM FIGHT ME ON THIS BLIZZARD IS ILLUMINATI BUSH\u2019S BAKED BEANS DID 9/11** ", "id": "daq826b"}, {"comment": "I just read through all of that and I'm not at all disappointed that I did!

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "daqd30c"}, {"comment": "thank u, doing *Lucio's ability's* work out there.", "id": "daqu3vq"}], [{"comment": "**HACKING NOISES**", "id": "daqh3kl"}], [{"comment": "I HAVE SPECIAL EYES", "id": "daqcc5n"}], [{"comment": "my god make more plz", "id": "daq6stm"}], [{"comment": "CYKA BLYAT RUSH HACK", "id": "daq9i1t"}], [{"comment": "This is the reason I came into existence\n", "id": "daqelqk"}, {"comment": "Me too thanks", "id": "daqpb3j"}], [{"comment": "Random = funny?", "id": "daqmbhl"}], [{"comment": "I'm not at all exaggerating when I say this is the funniest thing I've ever seen.", "id": "daqarwi"}], [{"comment": "I knew I shouldn't have drank that two month old milk.", "id": "daq5uxp"}], [{"comment": "You know why I've never done drugs?

Those feelings should be shared by us alone.\n\nAlthough I am a well-known person and have made my career as a professional athlete, I have been dismayed to realize the full extent of what tabloid scrutiny really means. For the last week, my family and I have been hounded to expose intimate details of our personal lives. The stories in particular that physical violence played any role in the car accident were utterly false and malicious. Elin has always done more to support our family and shown more grace than anyone could possibly expect.\n\nBut no matter how intense curiosity about public figures can be, there is an important and deep principle at stake which is the right to some simple, human measure of privacy. I realize there are some who don\u2019t share my view on that. But for me, the virtue of privacy is one that must be protected in matters that are intimate and within one\u2019s own family. Personal sins should not require press releases and problems within a family shouldn\u2019t have to mean public confessions.\n\nWhatever regrets I have about letting my family down have been shared with and felt by us alone. I have given this a lot of reflection and thought and I believe that there is a point at which I must stick to that principle even though it\u2019s difficult.\nI will strive to be a better person and the husband and father that my family deserves.

[Relevant Dev statement](http://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20746784507?page=3#post-54)\n\nOther Games can benefit from triple monitor setup such as sim racing games, where having that lets you see the apex and beyond a turn earlier and notice other drivers who are attempting to pass. \n\nFor Twitch-FPS games though I do not think a triple monitor setup would be worth it for a couple reasons, firstly to get good at aiming with the mouse takes practice to build muscle memory of being able to center the crosshair to what was previously any point on the screen, with triple monitor it greatly increases how far you'd have to move the mouse to twitch to that point, but also the bezel gaps add an uncertainty that would likely decrease consistency. Second! The extra monitors are more that the system has to render, which is probably not as useful as the possible lower input lag from a single monitor. relative to that most online FPS games are more tactical experiences, you typically already know the common choke points and areas where you should be looking, so having extra FOV doesn't give you an advantage if you're already looking close to where you should be. Plus most pros are typically wearing headsets that allow them to hear the enemy actions and where it happened, since they already know the maps they will know where to look for flankers etc at that point.\n", "id": "darpsiv"}, {"comment": "My issue is I have a hard time keeping track of a genji thats bouncing all over me when im trying to pin him down. or any hero for that matter once they are right up on me.

Use that shit often so flankers struggle to kill you. You take no damage for like 1 second and you'll be at full health in no time.\n\nLucio has a speed boost and can wall climb and he's a slippery motherfucker even for flankers to catch.\n\nZenyatta can outbox flankers with discord orb. But this often never happens because god forbid a healer needs to use accuracy.\n\nAna can also outbox flankers, though I think she might be a bit more vulnerable than Zenyatta because no bursting them with headshots, and her E doesn't really do that much damage unless you can manage to get a sleep combo on them.\n\nSurviving as a support is not hard. I totally get it, be annoyed with your team when Winston jumps into the backline and not a single person even turns to fight him.
