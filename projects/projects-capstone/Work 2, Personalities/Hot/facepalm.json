The OSU psychopath carried out his attack two days after ISIS called for attacks in the west. As for the registry, again you have been misled to believe something that isn't true. The registry would be the same registry that was already in place up until I believe 2013, maybe 2011, which did not track people based on a religion but tracked people based on the country they are coming from.

That said, I think you're misreading your source. \n\nThat paper is about elected officials serving as representatives; not about the way in which they are elected. It has nothing in particular to say about the merit of the electoral college versus the popular vote for choosing the President, let alone about eliminating the imbalance of electors in the college. If anything, there are a few places I would draw your attention to that would actually support the idea that the electoral college overruling the will of the majority is ultimately not what Madison or any other Federalist intended, and that the greater representation enjoyed by citizens of less populous states is a bug, not a feature. \n\n> By a faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adversed to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\n\nThis I include just to get a clear picture of what Madison is worried about. I'll grant you that political parties fit under the net of that concern; but to say that this paper is intended to guard against the party system when it was written five years prior to the formation of parties is anachronistic. What Madison is seeking to avoid is a system in which a group of people can use the government in order to deprive others of their rights. \n\n> If a faction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote. It may clog the administration, it may convulse the society; but it will be unable to execute and mask its violence under the forms of the Constitution.\n\nThis is, on its own, enough in my mind to show that this paper doesn't support a system that leads to an election like the one we just had. Whatever else you may argue Madison supports or rails against, this makes it clear that the intention was never for a minority of voters to be able to take control. In fact, the talk of \"clogging the administration\" shows exactly how Madison envisioned the republican system restraining the tyranny of the majority. A Congress which acts exactly as the most recent one has is that check. The Senate is the body of government that allows sparsely populated states to exert their will and check the voice of the majority; the Presidency is not. \n\n> From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction. \n\nThis starts the section comparing direct democracy to the republic. As I noted above, Madison (and everyone else) defines direct democracy as a form of government in which the citizenry is entitled to a direct vote on the issues. Any form of electing officials to govern is a republic, not a direct democracy. A direct democracy, in addition to the ways it may lead to a tyranny of the majority, just isn't practical in a country with some 230 million eligible voters. No one is suggesting switching to that. \n\n> The federal Constitution forms a happy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular to the State legislatures.\n\nThis is another form of protection for individual states. In addition to sending representatives on a state-by-state basis to the federal government, the ability to manage their own affairs is inherent in the formation of state and local governments. \n\n>Hence, it clearly appears, that the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic,--is enjoyed by the Union over the States composing it... The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States.\n\nThis is even more evidence that Madison is not advocating for any kind of system that results in the election we just had. Individual states overruling the will of the majority of the nation is exactly what just happened. \n\nTL;DR: This paper specifically argues against a system in which the President gets votes from states rather than people.

Why is a gun suddenly so much different, in this case?\n\nOn top of that, bear in mind the bible is actually designed to be a book that is relatable through changing times. The stories generally involve messages about morals and virtues. To talk about it being a matter of a \"historical figure\" from a different time frame is missing the mark a bit here, imo.\n\nI think that it's pretty fair for people to look at a passage of Jesus going \"Hey, getting weapons out is bad, guys\" and take something from that (as opposed to shit like TPP/DRM, which aren't really relatable), and that this is especially true when it's being used as a counterpoint to somebody else's take on what Jesus would have thought.\n\nBy the way, wp on making an atheist argue in support of being able to interpret Jesus's morals in modern times. >_>", "id": "dajgjbh"}, {"comment": "So Jesus wielded a whip and got pretty violent in a church at one point, and I don't think he would inherently be against owning weapons, I also think that the 2nd amendment is a far more complex argument than some people make it, much like TPP or DRM.

Hence the \"women be silent and subservient\" \"servants obey your masters\" \"men are the head of the household\" and \"God said kill all the non-believers\" sort of scriptures. I would like to believe that Jesus was the anti-religious figure since he often seemed at odds with the powerful members of the church and the government, but again it's hard to say how he would view the world and our issues in this century.  \n  Edit: I have to admit though, I am thoroughly enjoying this discussion and I'm very grateful that it hasn't turned into name-calling or general insults.

It was based on how far from the shore it was. The concept of bacteria and disease didn't exist back then in the way that it does now, so this was to some extent a rule that existed to help people. People noticed that if they ate shellfish that had been on the road for a while, they got ill, and they decided to stick a rule about it in there, no doubt. I don't know the precise origin for it, but it's a bit much for coincidence - there are a few things like that in the bible.\n\n>or the stoning of women who aren't virgins, selling daughters who are rape victims, incest, demonic possession, parting oceans, crumbling city walls with trumpets, speaking in tongues, seeing visions, etc...\n\nAlright. Fair enough though - I'll correct myself. The new testament is made to be fairly relatable. It's essentially a story of \"stop listening to all these rules and just be good people\". I guess that covers the next paragraph, too, since you mention the idea of Jesus as the anti-religious figure, too.\n\nAlso, agreed.. you should see the other discussion I'm having.

What are you basing your claim on?", "id": "dam3yoq"}, {"comment": "Because farrowing crates are slightly wider to allow the pig to lie down and they have extra space to the side for piglets to lay in while nursing. You can see the extra space to the right in OP's photo, contrasted with the [gestation crate photos in the wiki](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Gestation_crates_5.jpg) you linked. \n\nBut I didn't comment just to score a technical point on naming conventions between crates. There are legitimate legal, ethical, and practical differences between the use of gestation crates and farrowing crates. Gestation crates are where the pigs are held while pregnant and serve little purpose other than to save space and prevent aggression and miscarriages between pregnant sows (and people dispute whether that is a substantial concern). But farrowing crates are used because of a real phenomenon of \"sow overlay,\" which is statistically one of the highest causes of piglet death on farms. So a farrowing crate is used out of a verifiable concern for the piglets and actually has extra space; the gestation crate is used primarily to save space and the less legitimate concern for aggression between sows.\n\nMore than that, the crates do not have the same treatment under the law. Gestation crates are banned in the UK, the EU (after the fourth week of pregnancy), New Zealand, Canada, and nine states (perhaps more after the election, since MA passed a law requiring farm animals to have sufficient space to turn around). More than 60 major food companies have created policies prohibiting the use of gestation crates in farms where they source their food.\n\nYet the EU, the UK, Canada, all US states, and all of those major companies still use farrowing crates. Why? Because unlike gestation crates, there are persuasive ethical and practical reasons to keep nursing sows in farrowing crates for short periods. \n\nSo if the crate pictured is a farrowing crate, the individual in the FB post is completely correct -- they are only used for short periods, full-stop. If the crate is a gestation crate, then he is likely wrong, unless he lives in one of the minority of states banning their use. But either way the two crates are not functionally equivalent, and it would be wrong to leave readers with the impression that they are used by farmers for the same purpose.

"], [16, "So I have lived on a dairy farm my entire life and I am the eighth generation in my family to grow up on the farm. And it seems to me like most of the people in this thread are a little misguided. \n\nThe decision to be a dairy farmer means that you are devoting your entire life to making sure your cows live long, happy, comfortable lives. And from what I have seen, the vast majority of farms do this very well. That being said, there are definitely those few farms that need to work on things. \n\nOk, now let me correct some of the misguided comments I've seen here. \n\n1. Cows give birth to a calf once a year, and are in milk for approximately 305 days a year. When they get closer to calving they get a two month rest period where they don't milk and are pampered just like every pregnant lady should be. When the calf is born it is separated from the mother in the first day. We have to do this because more often than not the cow produces way too much milk to feed her one calf (one cow will easily feed 3-4 calves)and having a full udder is incredibly uncomfortable, and potentially harmful for the cow. \n\n2. So, as much as I hate it we cannot keep bull calves on our farm. Bull calves really serve no purpose to us because they don't make us any money. (Most dairy farmer's are not in the best financial situations, so we can't afford to be losing money)\n\nSince these are dairy breeds they aren't really that great for meat, so raising them for beef wouldn't yield any profit. Also bulls are a very dangerous, many years ago we used to keep bulls on our farm, my grandpa, and his brothers, had many near fatal encounters with the bulls. And many other farmers have gotten gored  or crushed to death by the bulls that they keep.\n\nSome farms keep bulls on the farm for natural breeding, but that is incredibly risky, and artificial insemination is much more reliable and provides a more diverse gene pool in the herd limiting genetic diseases and greatly reducing the potential for inbreeding. We can even breed with sexed semen which basically dictates what gender the calf will be.\n\nSo the bull calves go to beef producers where they are raised for beef or veal. To be honest I hate the idea of killing young animals for meat, and I would much rather see our bulls raised longer before they are turned into beef. But there is not much I can do as we are not financially capable of raising them ourselves.\n\n3. There was talk of hormone use in dairy herds, and in our herd we have never given growth hormones to our animals, and most milk companies don't even let their supplyers use Growth hormones. Growth hormones are more common in meat industries, as is the feeding of antibiotics. All milk is tested for things like antibiotics and growth hormones, and if any is detected in the milk, the entire truck is dumped and the farm that it came from is fined.\n\n\n_______________________________________\nOur cows, and so many other people's cows live much more luxurious, and stress free lives than most humans do. \n\nAs a suggestion to everyone reading this, make sure you educate yourself about what you are saying, make sure you are making accurate claims, go visit a farm, talk to a farmer, and witness these things first hand.

God created us to do as we wanted with animals. This is the mandate most people operate with. Descartes wrote about how animals are machines without souls. It's a bit barbaric to agree with him now.\n\nScientific pursuit has taught us that we evolved alongside all these animals and as a result we share a lot of emotions with them. Our brains function a lot alike. Cows can have friends and they show emotions. They play around and like to have fun. They have a natural bond with their offspring that is cut short because money. Totally inline with the evolutionary trend that most advanced animals (save for very basic creatures) have biological components that mimic what we call happiness or comfort or stress, etc. And fucking with that fucks with their psychology.\n\nI remember in my public (read secular) high school we learned about attributing human qualities to animals anthropomorphism (a long long time ago). And I remember my teacher telling us never to do that to animals because it's an illusion. But it's hard to look at an animals and not sympathize with them. We are a lot more alike than we would like to admit. \n\nHoward Stern said that he doesn't eat cows or pigs because they're too intelligent but he's ok with chicken. I really like that answer although I don't really listen to his radio program. If only because he took time to analyze what it means to eat meat and purchase meat willy nilly without knowing where it came from and how the animal was treated while alive.\n\nIt's a question we should all ask ourselves. If only for respect to the animal, whose treatment you are passively approving through buying cheap food.\n\n\n**EDIT: General response:**\n\n>Animals aren't sentient\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/SqTbUwq.gifv \n\nThis animal is exhibiting tension. It is tense. It's called being nervous. Its nerves are on edge because it's subconsciously aware of danger. \n\nWhat a lot of people don't understand is that what separates us from other animals is really our incredible ability at abstract thought. But other than that, we're pretty much like them. Evolution is NOT a progression. It's begging the question to say that evolution is a progression because it assume an end point. Human environmental condition allowed for more abstract thought to flow through us but we evolved similarly to other animals and we ARE animals. \n\nThere wasn't some fucking leap that with awareness came feeling scared or feeling alone or feeling happy. Animals exhibit this right it front you. Compare the lives of caged zoo animals with free-roaming animals. The zoo animals GET DEPRESSED. It's not anthropomorphism to say an animal that is usually roaming 100+ acres in their natural habitat is depressed because it's in a lot smaller enclosure, isolated from its species, in an unnatural climate. \n\n>Non-human animals eat other non-human animals so we can to\n\n1. Most arguments against eating meat is that in the current economic model, non-human animals are exploited for their natural biological processes. Chickens lay eggs at an unnatural rate until their organs wear out and they can't be used anymore locked up in cages with other chickens. Their attendants have to CUT THEIR BEAKS OFF because the environment is so hectic that it causes them to attack other chickens out of stress. They have to live without their beaks until their ass is raw and bleeding out at which point they're killed. \n\n2. Following the argument \"they do this so we can to\" is a fucking immature illogical argument that absolves you of making an actual decision.

And it seems to me like most of the people in this thread are a little misguided. \n\nThe decision to be a dairy farmer means that you are devoting your entire life to making sure your cows live long, happy, comfortable lives. And from what I have seen, the vast majority of farms do this very well. That being said, there are definitely those few farms that need to work on things. \n\nOk, now let me correct some of the misguided comments I've seen here. \n\n1. Cows give birth to a calf once a year, and are in milk for approximately 305 days a year. When they get closer to calving they get a two month rest period where they don't milk and are pampered just like every pregnant lady should be. When the calf is born it is separated from the mother in the first day. We have to do this because more often than not the cow produces way too much milk to feed her one calf (one cow will easily feed 3-4 calves)and having a full udder is incredibly uncomfortable, and potentially harmful for the cow. \n\n2. So, as much as I hate it we cannot keep bull calves on our farm. Bull calves really serve no purpose to us because they don't make us any money. (Most dairy farmer's are not in the best financial situations, so we can't afford to be losing money)\n\nSince these are dairy breeds they aren't really that great for meat, so raising them for beef wouldn't yield any profit. Also bulls are a very dangerous, many years ago we used to keep bulls on our farm, my grandpa, and his brothers, had many near fatal encounters with the bulls. And many other farmers have gotten gored  or crushed to death by the bulls that they keep.\n\nSome farms keep bulls on the farm for natural breeding, but that is incredibly risky, and artificial insemination is much more reliable and provides a more diverse gene pool in the herd limiting genetic diseases and greatly reducing the potential for inbreeding. We can even breed with sexed semen which basically dictates what gender the calf will be.\n\nSo the bull calves go to beef producers where they are raised for beef or veal. To be honest I hate the idea of killing young animals for meat, and I would much rather see our bulls raised longer before they are turned into beef. But there is not much I can do as we are not financially capable of raising them ourselves.\n\n3. There was talk of hormone use in dairy herds, and in our herd we have never given growth hormones to our animals, and most milk companies don't even let their supplyers use Growth hormones. Growth hormones are more common in meat industries, as is the feeding of antibiotics. All milk is tested for things like antibiotics and growth hormones, and if any is detected in the milk, the entire truck is dumped and the farm that it came from is fined.\n\n\n_______________________________________\nOur cows, and so many other people's cows live much more luxurious, and stress free lives than most humans do. \n\nAs a suggestion to everyone reading this, make sure you educate yourself about what you are saying, make sure you are making accurate claims, go visit a farm, talk to a farmer, and witness these things first hand.

The issue with it is not so much the extra cost, but the fact that because of the process used to sort the semen the viable sperm in sexed semen is lower, meaning conception rates are lower and this is where the unwanted cost comes in. if the cow does not \"catch\" (get pregnant) on the first attempt the farmer has to wait until the next heat cycle of the cow (about 21 days), this means an additional 21 days where the cows is costing money and not producing any profits", "id": "da6n6rc"}, {"comment": "Could you share your experience with separating day old calves from their mother?

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "dapq3dz"}, {"comment": "Why does this bot fake an edit? It's not like it needs to pretend to be an actual person.

Planets are round because they are spheres. Sphere's have the maximum amount of sphericity, meaning a collection of mass will naturally pull itself together to a shape of maximum possible sphericity.\n\n2. Because evolution doesn't work like that. When a mother gives birth to children. The two aren't identical. The one more suited to survive is more likely to live long enough to reproduce, it's traits are more common. Over time, humans evolved from not chimpanzees, but a common ancestor of chimpanzees.\n\n3. I have in fact seen a mountain form!\n\n4. Since when did anyone think life would show up in a jar of peanut butter?\n\n5. Why would someone have to hold up a singularity? Also, it's the fact it wasn't held up that caused it to expand.\n\n6. Okay, science never says God didn't create the universe. In fact, Genesis and the Big Bang theory line up quite nicely. Either way, by that logic, the universe must have a universer. Also, universes aren't paintings in the first place.\n\n21 (it skips 7 for some reason). Sigh... Humans didn't evolve from monkeys. We just have a common ancestor. Also, a clan of Neanderthals, would evolve over time as the most evolutionary advantageous traits prevail.\n\n 8. Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces. It is the result of the Electrograviweak force splitting into the Electroweak force and gravity. It pulls all objects with energy and momentum together, proportionate to their mass and quadratically inversely proportionate to their distance. Since both us and planet Earth have energy and momentum, we are pulled to each other. Also, how do *you* explain gravity?\n\n9. Once again... we didn't come from monkeys. We had a common ancestor.

Evolution isn't a religion, it's a scientific theory (not the type that is plausible, the type that is accepted as fact). Scientific research leads to cures for deadly diseases.

This is not a problem in itself. On the contrary. All the medication that we take is \u201cunnatural\u201d. So are glasses and crutches and cars and bicycles. Or the way you are reading this text: on a screen. None of this can be found in nature.\nWe are also constantly interfering in nature, most of the time for our own \u2013 Homo sapiens\u2019 \u2013 sake. We have cleared nature for roads, farmland, parks, buildings. Doing this, we have killed countless individual animals.\n\nMany people would agree that we, as humans, could or should try to solve the suffering in nature that we have caused ourselves \u2013 the way we make bridges or tunnels as corridors for animals when we have split their habitat into too many parts.\n**But what about suffering that is not due to us? Suffering is suffering, pain is pain. The cause of this suffering and pain \u2013 human or not \u2013 is totally irrelevant for those experiencing it.** For a rabbit it is irrelevant whether she suffers because of some disease or because she got caught in a poacher\u2019s trap (assuming both kinds of suffering are of similar intensity).\n\nMany animals have many young, but don\u2019t invest a lot of parental attention in them. The result is similar: an incredible number of animals will die at a very young age. European rabbits, for instance, can have 360 young in their lifetime, fifteen percent of which make it through their first year.\n\nMany or most of these animals probably don\u2019t die a painless or quick death. Apart from hunger, thirst, cold and drought, wild animals suffer diseases and injuries without any medical care being available to them. They are confronted with natural disasters like floods and fires.

But why not? Some might say Nature is Good and we shouldn't interfere.\n\n\nStill, the whole of human evolution is a story of going against, conquering, outrunning and outsmarting nature. This is not a problem in itself. On the contrary. All the medication that we take is \u201cunnatural\u201d. So are glasses and crutches and cars and bicycles. Or the way you are reading this text: on a screen. None of this can be found in nature.\nWe are also constantly interfering in nature, most of the time for our own \u2013 Homo sapiens\u2019 \u2013 sake. We have cleared nature for roads, farmland, parks, buildings. Doing this, we have killed countless individual animals.\n\nMany people would agree that we, as humans, could or should try to solve the suffering in nature that we have caused ourselves \u2013 the way we make bridges or tunnels as corridors for animals when we have split their habitat into too many parts.\n**But what about suffering that is not due to us? Suffering is suffering, pain is pain. The cause of this suffering and pain \u2013 human or not \u2013 is totally irrelevant for those experiencing it.** For a rabbit it is irrelevant whether she suffers because of some disease or because she got caught in a poacher\u2019s trap (assuming both kinds of suffering are of similar intensity).\n\nMany animals have many young, but don\u2019t invest a lot of parental attention in them. The result is similar: an incredible number of animals will die at a very young age. European rabbits, for instance, can have 360 young in their lifetime, fifteen percent of which make it through their first year.\n\nMany or most of these animals probably don\u2019t die a painless or quick death. Apart from hunger, thirst, cold and drought, wild animals suffer diseases and injuries without any medical care being available to them. They are confronted with natural disasters like floods and fires. There\u2019s parasitism, and of course there is predation\n\n\n[Source](http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/foundational-research/wild-animal-suffering/)\n\n[Source](http://veganstrategist.org/2016/06/01/the-extremely-inconvenient-truth-of-wild-animal-suffering/)", "id": "dactlfi"}, {"comment": "The entire world eco system, both on a grand scale and in each individual habitat, revolves around balance. A balance that nature itself provides. Each predator provides a prevention from over growth of each species of prey. So you take away those wolves ability or desire to eat meat and all of its natural prey now can grow and breed at limitless rates. Now there's more deer, rabbit, and other small game than there ever was before. \n\nNot to mention, where before only the strong and healthy could survive to breed and have young, now the sick and weak can breed which causes an intermingling of genes, which over generations of offspring, brings down the quality of each species, which ends in a mediocre form of wash species. \n\nSo now the eco system doesn't have enough food to go around, because everything is eating the grass, the leaves, anything they can. Eventually the food supply gets thin and rather than having healthy strong animals, the food shortage causes mass starvation and the animals who do breed will never grow the way they did in the past, which means that you get stunted and poorly bred animals, that get weaker and weaker. Eventually the eco system will run dry and everything will have to seek new food or die. \n\nThis is the same reason hunting is legal. Many don't realize the importance and incredible work that hunters do in regards to the balance. Each season we're told how many of what we can kill and we go out and kill just that, all the while every fee and most of the money we pay into our gear goes back into conservation efforts. Also in my family's hunting areas we keep tabs on the deer on our land and we do cull hunts a couple of times a season, where we go out and kill weak or sick or lame deer, so that they don't have to suffer and so healthy and strong deer can breed and make the gene pool better.

Specifically, the accounts in Genesis are there to evoke theological themes instead of scientific maxims, and to give us a picture of our relationship to God and creation, our relationship to one another and to the world, and also as to how and why that relationship - and our nature - became broken and weakened.\n\nAdam and Eve are mythic, but not from a point of view of \"false\" or \"whimsical\" - it is there to highlight very real and prevalent themes of the human condition that we already feel. It also highlights/prefigures the role of Christ as the New Adam and Mary as the New Eve - where the initial Adam and Eve declared a fundamental No to God's will (by listening to the serpent and eating of the fruit), the New Adam and Eve brought a restoration from a fundamental Yes to God's will (Mary from her \"be it done unto me according to your word\" to the angel Gabriel, and Jesus' trials through the Passion and accepting death on the Cross).\n\nAs I say, the Genesis Creation accounts are a vivid epic that help to explain the relation of things and to lend meaning, theme, and significance to our own human condition and, subsequently, the divinity of our own humanity, and - much later on - Jesus' humanity of his own divinity. \n\nSuch is the Catholic position on things.", "id": "daqzidt"}, {"comment": "> They are there to explain, in vivid description, why things are the way they are and give a focus on the meaning rather than the literal value of how things came to be. \n\nI agree, but I like to put it in a historical context, rather than a moral one.\n\nI've always considered the Garden of Eden and their expulsion as not necessarily about disobedience, but as a moment of *awakening*. I.e. in a certain point in history, mankind became more aware of itself, unlike the animals around them (I'll leave it up to you whether that's a good thing or a bad thing), represented as eating from the fruit of the tree of knowledge. This awakening has consequences and this is represented in the myth as the primordial couple leaving the 'ignorance is bliss'-paradise, because they have to live life differently now.\n\nAlso, remember that many of these stories come from the time when the first cities started. The neolithic revolution started in the fertile crescent and it caused a massive change in the way people looked at life, society and the order of things.

You can use this method to manage periods so you only have one every 3 or 4 months (it can cause a few months of inconsistency/bleeding as the body adjusts), or even stop them entirely. *To point out the obvious, speak to a doctor before changing the way you take prescription medication. I am not a doctor, this is just my own experience and understanding.*\n\nI think there was a scare about oral contraceptives causing infertility if you are on them too long, but I'm fairly certain it has been debunked. The only downside of this method that I experienced was before the laws changed, when insurance companies could refuse to pay for birth control if they wanted to. It would get expensive, but honestly it was SO worth it. Periods suck.

Viruses require living cells to multiply.\n\nViruses are therefore often grown in kidney cells, harvested from aborted fetuses and primates that were killed after other clinical trials. The initial tiny amount of pathogen is therefore multiplied, to be used in the next step, where the pathogen multiplies much slower. The use of monkey kidneys was what introduced the so called Simian Virus 40 into the human population.\n\nThe larger amount of pathogen is then intjected into eggs, to create part of the serum. The later neutered liquid from the egg is then combined with the adjuvants and preservatives. The adjuvants are substances that increase the sensitivity of the immune system to the pathogens, and are known to sometimes cause an allergy to eggs, as they cause the immune system to create antibodies against the eggproteins. It is possible to produce vaccines that do not use adjuvants; the German goverment and armed forces received hundreds of thousands of such dozes during the swine flu scare; but the general public generally does not receive these more expensive vaccines.\n\nThe claim of antivaxxers is that the adjuvants are non-selective, and might initiate an immune response against the body's own proteins. This is thought to be the case in the hundreds of confirmed narcolepsi cases in Sweden as a result of the swineflu vaccinations. Other claims of neurological or immunesystem related damage is refuted by large parts of the vaccine industry.\n\nThe perservatives are meant to inhibit biological activity in the vaccine serum, to keep it from spoiling.

Viruses require living cells to multiply.\n\nViruses are therefore often grown in kidney cells, harvested from aborted fetuses and primates that were killed after other clinical trials. The initial tiny amount of pathogen is therefore multiplied, to be used in the next step, where the pathogen multiplies much slower. The use of monkey kidneys was what introduced the so called Simian Virus 40 into the human population.\n\nThe larger amount of pathogen is then intjected into eggs, to create part of the serum. The later neutered liquid from the egg is then combined with the adjuvants and preservatives. The adjuvants are substances that increase the sensitivity of the immune system to the pathogens, and are known to sometimes cause an allergy to eggs, as they cause the immune system to create antibodies against the eggproteins. It is possible to produce vaccines that do not use adjuvants; the German goverment and armed forces received hundreds of thousands of such dozes during the swine flu scare; but the general public generally does not receive these more expensive vaccines.\n\nThe claim of antivaxxers is that the adjuvants are non-selective, and might initiate an immune response against the body's own proteins. This is thought to be the case in the hundreds of confirmed narcolepsi cases in Sweden as a result of the swineflu vaccinations. Other claims of neurological or immunesystem related damage is refuted by large parts of the vaccine industry.\n\nThe perservatives are meant to inhibit biological activity in the vaccine serum, to keep it from spoiling.

I am taking a class specifically devoted to the French Revolution itself.\n\nThe reason why I did not mention the French Revolution was because I have determined, after much reading and studying of it, that the massacres of innocent people were in no way justified, even for the sake of a revolution. They called for blood to be spilled in the name of blood being spilled, to scare people into going along with the revolution, people who literally did not know what was going on because they were simple peasant folk far away from Paris, where the radicalism was mostly concentrated. \n\nOh yes, the French Revolution worked so well that by 1805 Napoleon came in and kicked all of the extreme radicals in the asses and told them to smarten up. Let's also not forget that during the Reign of Terror members of the Convention were calling for bloodshed for the sake of bloodshed, basically citing a twisted version of Rousseau's \"Common Will\". \n\nSo what happened when people protested the Revolution in Paris, the monarchists in Levee and the peasants across the country that were appalled at their king being killed? They were blown to pieces with grapeshot in cannons. They were guillotined by the hundreds each day until the cities were virtually deserted in response to riots against the local radical Jacobin party in the cities they were based in. In Paris, officials found themselves torn apart by mobs, their heads put on pikes, their bodies lynched. It did not matter if they were simply a representative of the government and therefore doing their job or had done \"wrong\". They and anyone who opposed the mob were torn apart like rag dolls. The sans-culottes--the working class--were very much like the Brown Shirts employed by Mussolini in that they provided the brutish muscle for their preferred party, the Jacobin and Cordelier (moreso the Jacobins as time went on, and even then it was not a steadfast alliance but one of convenience). \n\nAnyone who dared to suggest that perhaps the bloodiness and violence was going too far was deemed counterrevolutionary and executed, including the man who became steel-hearted about it and eventually decided that any and all objections to his view of how the Revolution should go was an enemy of the Revolution and was to be done away with, Robespierre. \n\nSo no, I was not cherry picking. I was on mobile, actually, and had only 10% battery left, so I couldn't write an essay on why I disagreed with you. I could only write what I could recall off the top of my head.\n\nFascism and radicalism are very similar in that they desire extreme change and are willing to bully people to get it. Fascism wants radical change to transform society into a bastard love child of liberalism and conservatism. Radicalism often wants radical change into an oblivion which they decide the answers to when they get to them. The problem with revolutions is that there is rarely a game plan at the end of the road, or at least historically no one has had a game plan after they came out on the other side and instead tried to wing it. The result was a lot of miscommunication, loss of life, violence, anger from the people who wanted change yesterday, and mismanagement that could have been avoided if things had been planned before they decided to kick the powder keg. Even the American revolutionaries had to scrap their original government--the Articles of Confederation--since it was too weak.\n", "id": "da7uqge"}, {"comment": "> I have specifically learned about Latin American revolutions in my Ideology of the 20th Century class\n\nYou mean you were fed bourgie propaganda", "id": "da85f6n"}, {"comment": "Okay. Here's what happened in many instances of Latin American revolutions, as well as the American revolutions, at least how I've been taught:.'\n\nThe bourgeois, having found themselves faced with a glass ceiling in how far they could progress in society, wanted to change things. They wanted to have the same opportunities as those on top, which were pretty much exclusively foreign born Europeans, not native born peeps of European descent, and certainly not those who were mixed or native to the land itself. Helping them kick start their revolutions was the Enlightenment and a bit of the American revolution and such. After driving out the top people, the bourgeois conveniently replaced them as the top people while giving little to the little guys they supposedly were fighting for. \"We want voting rights, but not to poor people who can't afford their own land, of course. Not to uneducated farmers, no. I mean, we have to draw the line somewhere.\" So these revolutions, while indeed taking out the aristocratic, borderline feudal models, instead replaced them with their own bourgeois capitalist models which only continued to exploit the poor. The only difference is that now more people have the illusion that success was possible (in the cities), unaware that they were faced with a similar glass ceiling as the bourgeois before them.\n\nOf course, this Marxist model has been a favorite in historical analysis for quite some time, *especially* regarding the French Revolution. Unfortunately it has fallen out of favor for historians now that stuff has been relooked at and new information has come to light within the last century. Georges Lefebvre is someone I've read, albeit an abridged version, of his account of the series of revolutions that occurred within each class during the French Revolution itself, and I will not claim that he is wrong or discount his narrative, as it is very compelling and technically accurate. My problem is that Marxist history seems to have the habit of boiling history down to economic forces without considering the fact that people can and will act contrary to how they were raised, or their personality can override their supposed economic interests; this can be clearly seen within the Estates General where several priests and nobles actually agreed with the Third Estate on the need for reform. They were a minority but they still existed.\n\nAgain, Marxism seems to favor overall trends and ignored outliers, which I will admit often do not make as huge of an impact on how things turn out, at least when the ball gets rolling. I do not like generalizations that Marxism employs, and instead prefer to look specifically at individual parts. In my study of history I've come to realize that history is all about perception. Marxist theory, determinism, posthistoricism, all those are interpretations of what we know happened. None of them are wrong, but each one decides to focus on some structure of how and what and where and why and sometimes even when.\n\nSo I if you're implying that I am not educated in Marxist theory of historical materialism, well, you're fucking deadass wrong. I don't agree with it, that's why it was not included in my original narrative. It's the same reason why I didn't color my statements with \"God did this, God did that\", because I do not believe in the Medieval theory of history that history is determined by events that get us closer to God and paradise. I am hesitant to subscribe to any deterministic ideology as I believe that people can act contrary to everything they've been taught, given the circumstances. ", "id": "da8cazu"}, {"comment": "Marxism is anti determinist. Marx never proffered a blue print for a revolutionary program or method for that reason, arguing stateforms are built as a process of a class coming into its own. He specifically argued against this. So did his students. Only through struggle can we form a workers society because we will have to be forged by the problems of statecraft and tempered by the consolidation of state power in a new form. \n\nHe never believed socialism was truly inevitable: it's socialism *or barbarism,* a reflection of either a new class assuming a new form of power or general social disintegration and power vacuum. \n\nMarxism is about abstractions of social relations on the historical level, not individuals. It's about how the daily actions of millions interact in contradictory or complimentary or both ways to make history. It's dialectical because nature is, with complex feedback systems of cause and effect and changes in quantity observed as changes in quality, and it's materialist because \"God or George Washington did it\" isn't good science for good historical and economic analysis. \n\nWorkers are the only revolutionary class in capitalism, because we are the only ones capable of fundamentally altering social relations, which is what the revolution is. Capitalists can't revolutionize capitalism, they mostly resort to reformism or fascism to fix problems. Fascism is just liberalism without it's shallow humanist pretensions. It's fundamentally about protecting private property and traditional values in the face of capitalism which has no use for idyllic shit, but they don't want to really get rid of private ownership, just fully merge the political and economic wings of the bourgeois into a harmonious body to avoid the issue. They may see capitalism as a problem, but they never challenge it radically. \n\nMarxism took the world by storm because the people living in the front line of capitalist development, the people of the Third World, could see clearly the broken promises of liberal society as they fell out of bomb bay doors onto them simply for wanting the right to control their own affairs free from foreign intervention--this is opposed not because Kennedy or Nixon were simply evil, they were acting in their capacities of executives of stars whose economies need access to cheap labor and raw materials or they recess. Liberal states don't bomb their allies who abuse human rights, they arm them, so that was never and will never be the real cause de guerre.

Not to mention that tens of millions of Africans, Native North Americans, Latin Americans, poor white from all over Europe, and Asians had to be killed to make America what it is today. It's a bigger death toll than the October or Chinese revolutions, but those were about destroying white power, so they get demonized. The US currently has more people in prison and more extensive domestic spy apparatus than the Gulags or KGB ever did. \n\nSimilarly, in Finland, Soviets sprung up and built duel power without much violence, until the anti communists decided to prevent their loss of power to the councils.

If the victims have done as the guys in the above photo, it delays the attacker EVEN MORE, because he's gotta waste time getting through the pile of chairs.\n\nMeanwhile, as soon as you've got a 3rd officer on scene, you start fast-clearing buildings and moving towards the threat. The NUMBER ONE indicator of how many people will die in a mass shooting is the amount of time between the first shot, and the police intervention with the suspect. \n\nSpeed counts. The faster the police can engage the threat, the fewer people will die.\n\nAnd it takes a LOT more time to get *to* the threat, when you have to stop every idiot who thinks he's gonna just run down the halls fighting his way out. Because you have to stop EVERY person like that, and clear them, before you can move on to the actual threat.\n\nSo, by all means, go ahead and try to fight your way out.
