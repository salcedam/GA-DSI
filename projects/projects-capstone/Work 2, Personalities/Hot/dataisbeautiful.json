Growing up, watching sports was massively important to my family and friends. There was a lot of weight placed on your knowledge of the rules, strategies, histories, etc. of a variety of sports. Up until my mid 20s, I watched sports every week and talked about game results and the like constantly with friends. Now, however, I simply don't care anymore. A couple of things forced the change:\n\n*The insane amount of commercials have ruined the viewing experience for me. As I get older, I cannot tolerate sitting through commercial after commercial. I'd simply rather do other things. I've always advocated for the model in place for European football: Brand the hell out of the uniforms, the on-screen graphics, the stadiums, the equipment. Come up with a model where the teams, leagues, and the networks share in the profits. It has proven to be lucrative-perhaps not as profitable as the rapacious practices here, but it would be better for the integrity of sport in general, and would making watching a game from start to finish more tolerable.\n\n*The delivery of sports content did not fit with how I consume media. As cable programming became more inane, I moved much of my viewing to online alternatives. Rather than follow this trend, sports doubled down on cable as their delivery mechanism. Yes, they made a ton of money from media companies trying to secure exclusive rights, but now the backlash is happening. \n\n*When I do want to watch something, I have to wade through so many sub-channels to find a game. Is it on FS 1, 2, 3? Is it on one of seven ESPNs? In their greed to carve up sports programming to upsell higher-tier packages, cable companies have made finding games very frustrating. When I find out that a game or sport is exclusive to a certain package, it doesn't make me want to buy that package. It makes me not care. \n\n*The announcing has become brain-dead. Madden and Summeral, Albert and Fratello, Michaels and Gifford--these guys got you into the game and made you care. Nantz and Simms drone on and on, miss calls, say nothing interesting, and feel very scripted. I'd rather hit the SAP button than listen. This wears on you after many years. \n\n*Having NFL season tickets was a miserable experience. I hated the 8 hours it took  fighting traffic in both directions, parking, and watching the game. I hated the sky-high ticket prices and PSL fees just for the right to buy tickets. It hammered home the point that teams really don't care about their fans, and that new stadiums are there to sell luxury boxes to the wealthy and overpriced merch to everyone else. This really made me disengage with sports. \n\nI still watch the NFL with my father out of tradition, and watch more so for our relationship than for any love of the sport. If this weren't our hobby, I would have stopped watching years ago. In my own house, I still watch sports, but different sports. I watch European soccer via the Fox and Fubo TV apps, sumo wrestling via YouTube, and various racing events through their own dedicated apps and websites. I can scratch the sports viewing itch without needing cable and, that is more important to me than any team loyalty. "], [1162, "I am 35 now and as I grow up I just no longer have any emotional vested interest in these players or teams anymore. I am older than most these athletes and the way the marketing and how much money is involved in this \"entertainment\" just loses all the draw for me. I look back at my youth and reflect on when the Oilers left my home city... Houston in 1995. I was crushed. Little did 15 year old me know back then, they didn't give two shits about me at all. \n\nWhen I was younger, these players were heroes to me. Idols I tried to emulate. The game seemed a lot more pure so to say. Now? I see right through the marketing and over saturation of advertising. The ESPN effect, media favoritism towards teams, the commercialization, hostile hijacking of local municipalities in forking over billions to build stadiums on the taxpayers dime or threat to move the team. The blatant incompetence of officiating towards certain players. Its so forced and these players are making such exorbitant amounts of money I really don't take their motivation seriously anymore. \n\nI used to be all about the NBA, NFL and MLB to where I followed them almost religiously. Now? I just don't give a F anymore.

Provide us sports that aren't greater than 50% advertisements, we will watch them again.\n\nI just recently went to a few college basketball games.  The one that wasn't televised was FUCKING AWESOME.  Like I remember growing up.  People played basketball, the action continued, and I didn't end up in the arena until midnight and have to work the following day (even Jordan era NBA games didn't last as long as shitty college teams farting around on the court). \n\nThe next game was televised.  I honestly wanted to leave by half.  Literally 30-45 minutes added to the FIRST HALF so they could squeeze some fucking bullshit advertisements down the throats of people paying to watch at home.  \n\nShit isn't acceptable. Some of us have shit to do (mostly work to pay off student loans) and don't want to waste an entire night watching commercials interrupted by a brief sporting event.  When I watch reddit streams that cut out the commercials, literally half of the event is some drab music playing with a COMMERCIAL BREAK picture sitting in the middle of my stream.

There are half-time shows and stuff. And there is a camera feed for the big screens, and a direct soundfeed for the venue speakers that you can stream from. Suddenly, you can also sell the half-time show to the audience at home.\n\nThe NBA League Pass actually works like that. They don't have the rights to run anything but the feed of the game. The commercials and other stuff from the various tv channels only gets streamed to the tv channels.\n\nSo whenever they cut to the studio or do commercial breaks for half-times and time-outs, they cut the feed to the big screen in the venue. Sometimes that's an overview of the arena (typically for timeouts, lasts 20-60 seconds). For some short breaks, it's some commercial, anyway. Sometimes, it's the venue-commentator reminding people that foul language and being intoxicated may get you thrown out of the venue, which can seem irrelevant to you, but not more so than a bad commercial.\n\nAnd finally, there are the half-time shows which I've personally grown pretty fond of. Whether it's gymnastics, or some indian culture night, or junior dancers, the entire event is made to be entertaining.

Growing up, watching sports was massively important to my family and friends. There was a lot of weight placed on your knowledge of the rules, strategies, histories, etc. of a variety of sports. Up until my mid 20s, I watched sports every week and talked about game results and the like constantly with friends. Now, however, I simply don't care anymore. A couple of things forced the change:\n\n*The insane amount of commercials have ruined the viewing experience for me. As I get older, I cannot tolerate sitting through commercial after commercial. I'd simply rather do other things. I've always advocated for the model in place for European football: Brand the hell out of the uniforms, the on-screen graphics, the stadiums, the equipment. Come up with a model where the teams, leagues, and the networks share in the profits. It has proven to be lucrative-perhaps not as profitable as the rapacious practices here, but it would be better for the integrity of sport in general, and would making watching a game from start to finish more tolerable.\n\n*The delivery of sports content did not fit with how I consume media. As cable programming became more inane, I moved much of my viewing to online alternatives. Rather than follow this trend, sports doubled down on cable as their delivery mechanism. Yes, they made a ton of money from media companies trying to secure exclusive rights, but now the backlash is happening. \n\n*When I do want to watch something, I have to wade through so many sub-channels to find a game. Is it on FS 1, 2, 3? Is it on one of seven ESPNs? In their greed to carve up sports programming to upsell higher-tier packages, cable companies have made finding games very frustrating. When I find out that a game or sport is exclusive to a certain package, it doesn't make me want to buy that package. It makes me not care. \n\n*The announcing has become brain-dead. Madden and Summeral, Albert and Fratello, Michaels and Gifford--these guys got you into the game and made you care. Nantz and Simms drone on and on, miss calls, say nothing interesting, and feel very scripted. I'd rather hit the SAP button than listen. This wears on you after many years. \n\n*Having NFL season tickets was a miserable experience. I hated the 8 hours it took  fighting traffic in both directions, parking, and watching the game. I hated the sky-high ticket prices and PSL fees just for the right to buy tickets. It hammered home the point that teams really don't care about their fans, and that new stadiums are there to sell luxury boxes to the wealthy and overpriced merch to everyone else. This really made me disengage with sports. \n\nI still watch the NFL with my father out of tradition, and watch more so for our relationship than for any love of the sport. If this weren't our hobby, I would have stopped watching years ago. In my own house, I still watch sports, but different sports. I watch European soccer via the Fox and Fubo TV apps, sumo wrestling via YouTube, and various racing events through their own dedicated apps and websites. I can scratch the sports viewing itch without needing cable and, that is more important to me than any team loyalty. ", "id": "dagwb26"}, {"comment": "That was a good read.

American business is too opportunistic.  Look at the NBA where commercials are going up and now they're just beginning to sell add space on the jerseys.  It's definitely going to get worse and worse.  One sport that I think does well with this due to \"tradition\" is baseball.  When they fall, it all crumbles imo.\n\n>Having NFL season tickets was a miserable experience\n\nSame applies to every NBA streaming service I've used.  Why would I pay 200 to 300 a year for NBA games if my local team games are blacked out....it's not the service we want, it's a luxury on top of the cable subscriptions we're expected to buy.  Hence the rise of the ghetto streams.\n\nI'm right with you though, I don't care about football at all anymore it seems, NFL or college.  Baseball is fun because there's an awesome stadium to go to nearby, but I don't really watch games on TV besides playoffs.  I'm still a hoophead, but star favoritism or refs making bad calls is the worst in the NBA than any other sport due to pace and the number of refs on the court.\n\nHonestly I think this is more about the economy than anything.

For instance, every person that has cable pays something like $7 of their cable bill straight to ESPN. ESPN is paying $15.5BILLION for 9 years of MNF rights. Just MNF. That's over $100m a game. Each cable subscriber pays $22 for MNF a year, whether you watch it or not. \n\nThey will not have the subscribers at this rate to afford these sports rights contracts by about 2020. That's when they will start to spiral into an oblivion. \n\nBesides, in October 2016, they just lost 620k subscribers. The biggest loss ever. That is an annualized rate of 7.5m. More than double last year. \n\nhttp://www.outkickthecoverage.com/espn-loses-621-000-subscribers-worst-month-in-company-history-102916\n\nThey're a dead man walking.

My goal was an AI that was intelligent, but able to make mistakes and seem almost human.\n\nA few lessons I learned:\n\n1) Not only does the AI need to have multiple heuristics to navigate multiple kinds of spaces, but the AI needs to have a genetic databank to help analyze information while still allowing mutation and selection to continually randomly improve old memories.\n\n2) Nodes should be of arbitrary size and location. Furthermore, nodes at the minimum spacial subdivision should be explored when all other granularities have been exhausted with no good solution.\n\n3) Pathfinding operations should operate dispersed over time and never fully block the process from doing other things.\n\n\nImitation rules: (Goal is not to get the right answer, but to simulate human-like navigation habits.)\n\n4) Pathfinding should be permitted to make mistakes. Observers will interpret this positively and even assign abstract goals/personal qualities over time due to ingrained  anthropocentrism.\n\n5) Pathfinding should not care about actions too far in the future, nor should they have access to the nodegraph beyond what they can currently see. Memories of discarded nodegraphs can be simulated by leaving \"pheromone\" trails. Tweaking pheromone heuristics priorities via an inherited pseudo-random property of each nodewalker will give varying degrees of competence/familiarity with the space.\n\n6) If a pathfinding operation is long-running, stalling out the AI nodewalker's movement, or just slowing it down along an approximated path is a very effective way of simulating humanity while also giving the process time to catch up.\n\n7) Obstacle avoidance algorithms provide a second layer of intelligence for nodewalkers. On the one hand, merely navigating the space is already complex enough, and that's where most consumer applications stop, but developing a means of recognizing obstacles and giving AIs abilities to recognize their patterns will create much less manipulatable AI.\n\n8) AI nodewalkers should not have a single weighted method of movement. A variety of competing interests and directions of travel should be explored for each walker. Attaching pseudorandom properties will give personality to nodewalkers, while also allowing individual mutation along these properties will allow variety. Uniform action and motion is unnatural. Particularly among groups of individuals.\n\n9) Fluid simulation can be used to model group/mob movement much easier than path/repath and leader/follower/swarm behaviors. Simply think of the path toward the destination as a sort of the bottom of a basin. Apply surface tension along any nodes not along this path within a set radius based on the size of the mob.

On the other hand, Obama is the \"leader of the free world\" and the free world operates inefficiently, it does, but it was designed that way. The writers of the constitution understood the danger of tyrants, and knew that if a parliament could pass something easily, they would pass anything, no matter how terrible it was.

For anyone wondering, Voronoi's model is created by drawing random points or \"nucleation sites\" on your palette or model. Then each point has a line connecting it to its nearest neighboring points, and the \"grain boundaries\" are drawn as bisecting lines of those. Since nucleation sites grown outwards at the same rates in homogeneous systems, it is a great modeling tool.

For anyone wondering, Voronoi's model is created by drawing random points or \"nucleation sites\" on your palette or model. Then each point has a line connecting it to its nearest neighboring points, and the \"grain boundaries\" are drawn as bisecting lines of those. Since nucleation sites grown outwards at the same rates in homogeneous systems, it is a great modeling tool.

Let me try to pull this argument back a little because I'm getting heated and I think it's preventing me from explaining myself clearly.  \n\nOP posted a picture saying \"random data is beautiful.\"  What s/he has posted is indeed a beautifully-shaded and outlined picture that shows some elegant colour patterns and the outlining wonderfully illustrates that the design has the same detail at (almost) any level of magnification.  And indeed, there is a random number generator used in the code.\n\nBut it isn't random data.  He is using a rainbow algorithm to shade the polygons using a regular pattern.  That's why it seems to \"fade\" to red or blue or green in certain areas.  Very pretty, but not random.  He's also using thicker outlines in some areas to \"illustrate\" the repeating pattern as you magnify.  See how the big polygons are subdivided into smaller polygons which are subdivided into even smaller polygons?  The reason this is so obvious is because *it's drawn that way*.  Some of the outlines are thicker, which create arbitrary groupings in the data.\n\nThe point being that if this were black and white and all the lines were the same width, this would be much closer to random data.  *And not very beautiful at all.*  Similarly, I could take a sufficiently detailed collection of \"random\" polygons, selectively shade some of them in to look like the Mona Lisa, and say \"look, beautiful random data!\"  But it's not, because the beauty only came from me modifying how the data is rendered to introduce patterns that aren't really there.\n\nEDIT: Removed references to \"fractals\" and \"infinite level of detail\" since this illustration obviously can't be broken down any further than a single polygon.

Thus, the BMI should most likely relate mass to height ^ ~2.4 or something similar.

The average home price is only $140,000 in WNY. You're paying a fair amount if you're living in a $100 k home in the first ring suburbs. But yeah it sucks if you just bought a new $400,000 home in a new subdivision.\n\nAlso part of the issue is that young people just are not attracted to the small former industrial towns and cities that dot the countryside. No jobs and nothing to do are one thing, but these cities seem to do everything to not invest in things young people look for when searching for a place to settle.\n\nBuffalo, Rochester and Albany are all doing fairly well right now and all are investing in things young people tend to expect. But cities like Jamestown, Oswego, Watertown will likely never recover unless current migration trends change regardless of taxes. If taxes were really the issue, NYC, Seattle, Boston and many other cities should be struggling.

I understand the fear that then the government knows where all the guns are, and they can't take your guns away if they don't know you have them...

Sure, anyone can own a long gun, but if you want a hand gun you have to demonstrate you can handle the gun safely and accurately.\n\nI also think every gun should be required to be insured with a policy that pays out in the event someone is killed or injured by the gun.

They control the supply of the currency they spend in. No one else has the capacity to permanently produce currency (banks create money whenever they lend, but it sums to zero long term). Government created money when they want to spend, and when they run a deficit, they'll often issue bonds after the fact for people to invest their spare cash into as a way of offsetting inflation, and to set a minimum level of interest anyone can offer in the economy. If you're offering a lower interest rate than government bonds do, no one is going to give you their money. \n\nAnother thing to consider, looking at a government spending more than it taxes as a 'deficit' and taxing more than it spend as a 'surplus' gives the impression that a surplus is something to strive for. In a country like the US where you run a current account deficit (you import more than you export), the government continually running a surplus means it is constantly draining money from the private sector for no reason.

The reason being is the nature of the product. The Autos can manufacture 'x' amount of defective products and see no real kickback from buyers. However, in my company's field we only manufacture Class 3 electronics - they cannot leave the plant if they are defective. No exceptions. Class 3 includes critical electrical systems: Life support machines, satellite communication devices, and other critical systems. Quality control has to meet the highest standard i.e., 0% void in through-hole soldering, 0% bridging on SMT parts, etc. \n\nAs a low tier worker, it is my understanding that the reasoning for hiring more bodies on the floor is to improve quality processes. The company genuinely believes in its workers at all levels. Sounds a bit mushy, but they(process engineers) are constantly reevaluating processes and adding TD's to different builds that assembly workers have to follow. At any rate, SMT machines and offline AOI's need operators  to function properly. \n\nTLDR; consumer items that have minimal quality control do not need more employees - cars, boats, radios, personal electronics; but high performance, life saving equipment that is critical to power systems actually appears to thrive with more workers surrounding the process.

We mostly believe injustice will be addressed in the end, because our society is largely functional.  The reality is that none  of this is at all certain.  \n\nWe have had one of the longest periods of relative peace in world history (unbelievable that all the terrible shit that happens is still \"relative peace\").  It can get much, much worse.  The only thing stopping absolutely horrific things from happening across the entire globe is the collaboration of the majority of the world.  We have unprecedented communication, collaboration, and understanding.  This collaboration is only possible because the guardian power keeping everyone at the negotiating table is so far ahead of everyone else that it cannot be realistically challenged (no, that is not the U.S., it is NATO as a whole).  \n\nBetween the U.S. and NATO, nobody in the world has much room to act up.  Democratic capitalism has also ensured that the West is more concerned with creating new, compatible economies to sell shit to than taking anything over and being forced to manage it itself.  I'm convinced this has been the driving force preventing NATO itself from becoming what it was created to prevent.  Violence is less preferable than non-violent wealth.  The U.S. is the master of repackaging anything you give us and selling it back to the world.

It enforces that power with terrifying levels of surveillance and police enforcement (yes, we have the NSA, but they have government cameras in every university classroom, no really, that is true).  They control media and the entire internet.  The world the PRC would create is not one many Americans want to live in.

", "id": "daq9hdc"}, {"comment": "I agree with much of what you said, but I just want to split a few hairs about China.  Particularly the following: \n\n>they have government cameras in every university classroom, no really, that is true \n\nI am an American university student currently spending this semester at one of the top Chinese universities.  This statement is 100% *false*.  There are not cameras in my classrooms.  I don't doubt that there are in some, nor that some may be bugged, but this is a somewhat flagrant misrepresentation of China as far more Orwellian than reality, in my opinion. While the level of political control in China is high, it is not nearly as all oppressive as many in the US/West seem to think.  I've had numerous discussions with Chinese people about the Chinese government, democracy, 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other sensitive topics.  I've had professors tell students that they must \"scale\" the Great Firewall (not too difficult for the tech savvy, especially the younger generation) if they truly want to understand the world and receive true information.  I've had a professor say that though it may be sensitive, he does not fear criticism/censure; China must become democratic.  Certainly, I am listing the exceptional counterexamples to make a point.  Political repression in China is most definitely an issue, but, at least in elite universities, discussion is relatively open, though elite universities are certainly not representative of the country at large.\n\nFurther, I would argue that the CPC does not \"rule with absolute power\" enforced with \"terrifying levels of surveillance and police enforcement.\"  They certainly do maintain strict political control and a high level of digital surveillance.  More so, I would say their power is solidified by economic growth.  If the Chinese economy slows significantly (instead of the current \"sluggish\" 6.5% growth, something like 3%) or, god forbid, enters a recession, I would expect to see hints of political instability.  What form that would take, I don't know.  Under Mao, the PRC was held together by the fact that China had finally emerged united, minus Taiwan and Hong Kong/Macau until the 1990s, from it's \"century of humiliation\" and almost nonstop warfare.  When Mao felt power slipping from his grasp in the 60s, he strengthened his own cult of personality and launched the Cultural Revolution.  But after his death, and particularly since the Reform and Opening-Up in 1979, economic growth has kept the CPC in power.  The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, coupled with the fall of the Berlin Wall and Communist regimes in eastern Europe culminating with the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, which is in part attributable to Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, led the CPC to institute stricter political controls than had been in place during the 80s.\n\nAnd that's how we got to where we are today.  Unfortunately, how history is taught in Chinese schools has a huge impact on the general perception of America and the West.  Democracy is viewed extremely cynically by many, and the election of Donald Trump is doing wonders for the viewpoint of the CPC, but there is a not insignificant population that is interested.  As of now, most of those interested have no desire to agitate for political reform.  \"It's the economy stupid.\"  Such an agitation would affect the stability and economic growth of the country.  Only if the [Chinese Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Dream) of a [harmonious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonious_Society) and [moderately prosperous society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderately_prosperous_society) is threatened will the CPC be threatened.\n\nNow, I certainly agree with you that I do not want to see a world with China as the sole superpower.  China is well positioned to become far more powerful than the Soviet Union ever could.  It is more populous than the USSR ever was, is in the process of developing an advanced market economy, is endowed with a huge land area (though ostensibly smaller than Russia, Canada, and the US, China doesn't possess large and mostly unusable arctic/subarctic like in Siberia, northern Canada, or Alaska), and does not face the level of separatism that led to the disintegration of the USSR.  While some in Tibet and Xinjiang may agitate for independence, Xinjiang has become largely Sinicized and Tibet increasingly so.  To stand up to this coming threat, the United States must be smart and Trump is a massive step in the wrong direction.  We need to build strong international alliances, especially with Europe, and help strengthen the economies and democracies of India, Latin America, and other Pacific rim nations.  In American politics, I was a supporter of Bernie Sanders and consider myself a huge progressive, but in part for this reason I am a supporter of the TPP and am extremely disappointed it stands little to no chance of passing.\n\nWe are entering what may be the most volatile period in international politics since WWII, and certainly since the end of the Cold War.  I absolutely agree that too many people fail to recognize this or the idea that instability and even war can come about quickly and easily.  Nothing says the United States must or will remain the hegemonic superpower, that democracy will continue to spread, or even that the United States/Western Europe will remain democratic.  \n\nEdit: For anyone unaware, **CPC=Communist Party of China**.

This suggests that the occupants were in fact monitoring the results of the polls. However this analysis is only exploratory and further analysis, involving more advanced methods would need to be performed to accurately answer the question.\n\nThe use of a line chart is perhaps not a good idea since the data is not continuous. Each observation (row) in the dataset is comprised of 30 minute intervals in  columns,  which are discreet. The columns or variables are a summation of the power consumption (instantaneous) over thirty minute intervals. Power is a continuous measurement. Energy is usually determined by first dividing the power (watts) 1000 to get kilowatts and then multiplying the kW by the amount of hours, with 1 hour being a normal period. So, it would be better to only plot the hourly data rather than half hourly.\n\nNow, since the data is discrete, the plot should not use lines but rather scatter points or horizontal bars. The main reason for this is that we do not know what happens between the intervals. We could interpolate but still it is best practice not to use continuous lines for discreet/categorical data.\n\nSome other comments. A plot should contain a main title and labels on both axes along with the legend.\n\nThanks OP for sharing. I might explore the dataset further when I have time. Keep up the good work and consider my comments as it is meant to help you improve.\n\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: Could OP explain how he determined the median? \n"], [4, "I'm not really seeing the beauty in this presentation, it doesn't really draw the viewers attention to any clear conclusions and the graph is pretty poorly plotted with badly thought out axis and lack of titles."], [1, "Can someone please explain to me how the median can end up lower than both lines?"], [1, "I'd be more interested in water consumption. \n\nLike this one for an Australian footy final: \n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ct0WvQ5VMAAS6dM.jpg "], [0, "Next time you want to make a graph and have CSV data sources, check out Tableau Public"], [-1, "They should buy tesla power wall setup, for to average those peaks.

The EU, arguably more than NATO, deters conflict in eastern Europe, so its disappearance could be game changing. Brexit is also much more significant on a social level as it has been the first large vote to usher in this new wave of hard right populism, driven by xenophobia and anti-immigration, pushed by baby boomers. And since Brexit, we've seen similar votes in multiple countries, including the US, and we may see yet more in France, the Netherlands and Germany. The breakup of the EU could also be incredibly significant when it comes to climate change and migration - the EU is surrounded by countries which are heavily affected by war and climate change, and will become a hotspot of migration in the coming years. The state of the EU will affect that immensely.

But I wouldn't remotely say that they 'do little' to keep Russia in check. \n\n> Xenophobia and far right revivals were well underway and have already been given the benefit of brexit.\n\nNot really. There were hard right parties and votes gaining popularity in small countries, such as Hungary, but Brexit was pretty groundbreaking. Especially since it set the formula which has been followed almost to the letter by the US election, and which the French election seems to be in risk of following as well.

The exception i'll note is Poland.\n\nThat's completely untrue. The entire future of the EU depends on whether the UK sinks or swims as it leaves. If it sinks, the EU will carry on the road to federalisation, and if it swims, the EU will disintegrate, because every other eurosceptic country in the EU is watching to see how the UK does, and will act based on the UK's result. If they see that leaving the EU leads to downturn, they will be deterred from leaving, Euroscepticism will fade, and the EU will become even more tightly united than ever before, while the UK fades from relevance in the background. If they see that countries can make a success of leaving the EU, it will be a rallying cry for eurosceptics, who will be guaranteed huge wins in countries like France, Italy, Spain and Germany.

This suggests that the occupants were in fact monitoring the results of the polls. However this analysis is only exploratory and further analysis, involving more advanced methods would need to be performed to accurately answer the question.\n\nThe use of a line chart is perhaps not a good idea since the data is not continuous. Each observation (row) in the dataset is comprised of 30 minute intervals in  columns,  which are discreet. The columns or variables are a summation of the power consumption (instantaneous) over thirty minute intervals. Power is a continuous measurement. Energy is usually determined by first dividing the power (watts) 1000 to get kilowatts and then multiplying the kW by the amount of hours, with 1 hour being a normal period. So, it would be better to only plot the hourly data rather than half hourly.\n\nNow, since the data is discrete, the plot should not use lines but rather scatter points or horizontal bars. The main reason for this is that we do not know what happens between the intervals. We could interpolate but still it is best practice not to use continuous lines for discreet/categorical data.\n\nSome other comments. A plot should contain a main title and labels on both axes along with the legend.\n\nThanks OP for sharing. I might explore the dataset further when I have time. Keep up the good work and consider my comments as it is meant to help you improve.\n\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: Could OP explain how he determined the median? \n", "id": "dagmztv"}, {"comment": "Well, in that case it's not categorical data, but rather a time series. Agreed, the time resolution isn't the best, but it's still a time series, and thus a line chart is totally appropriate.\n\nI'm curious what would you consider to be \"continuous\" data?  What if the energy consumption was cataloged every second? every millisecond?  Then surely that would be a continuous measurement? Anyhow, what I'm getting at is that no matter what the time resolution is, time-series data will *always* be discrete except if you have an analytical function, but then it's not measured data anymore, but a theoretical model. Measured data is by its nature discrete (hence why we use the term data points).\n\nAlso, electrical energy is usually measured in kWh because it's a convenient unit, but you can consume any amount of kWh in a second, hour etc. You do not need to fraction it into hours just because there is the word 'hour' in the unit name. kWh can be directly converted in Joules (1 kWh=3600 Joules), BTUs (1 kWh = 3412.14 BTU)  or any other units of energy.\n\nSaying that kWh can only be expressed over an hour period is like saying that Joules can only be measured over distances of one meter since they are defined as the work exerted by a 1 Newton force over a distance of 1 meter.", "id": "dagqs7e"}, {"comment": "Thanks for your contribution. :)\n\n\nThe AC frequency in UK is 50HZ (50 cycles per second.) At this rate the sample data(even at  lesser rate), would be considered as continuous time series. Voltage is 230V. The sampling rate is different due to other issues but from my research the meters use 10 second intervals. http://jack-kelly.com/uk_smart_meters_sample_rate_and_reactive_power . Thus voltage and current is logged every 10 seconds.\n\n  Power (Watts), which is instantaneous,  is determined from the equation: P=V*I. Energy (kWh*), as I wrote before, is, in this case calculated every 30 minutes but the plot on the source website that OP linked, displays 1 hour intervals. Of course you could calculate energy over a smaller period, but that would depend on your audience. The smart meters on the market could update kWh every 30 minutes. Someone looking at a plot for a certain day might only want to see the hourly intervals. A consumer looking at the monthly bill only sees the monthly kWh.\n\nAt the level of granularity, 30 minutes or 1 hour the variables are sparse enough that they could be considered discrete. Time series data and discrete values are not mutually exclusive. For example. Monthly sales data is time series. If you plot 12 months of data, that is only 12 points and each point is an integer.The number of months over a year are counted quite easily. The point here is that the data is discrete. The term categorical is more suited to State, city, group, color, race etc type of data. \n\nFor the most part the OPs plot can tell a story and will suffice for many people. There are some, like myself, that are trained in this area (engineering and data science) that will raise questions as to the validity of using lines instead of points or bars. I could for instance contend that there could be points at 00:10, 00:15, 00:20 and 00:25 which if plotted will not result in a straight line. I also mentioned interpolation as a method to address this issue if you prefer using lines. However, if you are presenting the plot to energy professionals they would expect to see a bar rather than a line chart.\n\nEdit: I want to clarify this point further in response to P_Schrodensis 's question.\n> I'm curious what would you consider to be \"continuous\" data? What if the energy consumption was cataloged every second? every millisecond? Then surely that would be a continuous measurement?\n\nPower is what is instantaneous. So if I say the at t=0.001s the power consumption of my heater was 2kW, then at the split second my heater used 2kW. at t=0.002s , I flick the switch off and then P=0kW.\nElectrical Energy is usually summed over a time period. To determine that I have to measure consumption continuously, log it and then at the end of the period sum it up. So if I had 10 * 100W light bulbs on for an hour, my energy usage is determined as : \nP=10*100 = 1000W\n1000W/1000 = 1kW\n1kW * 1hr = 1kWh\n\nSo this tells me that for the hour spanning t=1.00am to t=2.00am, my energy consumption was 1kWh.\n\nNow, if I reduce the time interval to seconds or milliseconds, as you suggest, I will end up with something that becomes instantaneous and that is referred to as Power. The unit for Power is Joules/Second or Watts, as it is more commonly referred to. \n\n\n", "id": "dagt4wl"}, {"comment": "Sorry for all the downvotes, reddit doesn't like actual experts discussing their fields in a constructive manner.\n\nWould an ELI5 summary of your explanation be that the lines indicate a constant testable increase in usage, whereas the actual increase between 7am and 7:15am was a Keurig being used for 5 minutes to make coffee and wasn't actually split over the 15 minutes as the line would have you believe?\n\nThis is where the bars come in and say between 7 and 7:15 30kWh worth of energy consumption was used above the norm?", "id": "dagw5op"}, {"comment": ":) To be honest I am so captivated to have this opportunity to discuss something I am excited about that I didn't actually notice the downvotes.

What if there is a device that is only switched on for a few microseconds? You would still lose information as your sampling rate is not infinite, thus the data is no more continuous than for 30 minute sampling rate in my eyes as an engineer and a physicist. There can always be a data point between two of your data points that does not follow a straight line, no matter your sampling rate!\n\nI guess I am used to dealing with quantities that have vastly different orders of magnitudes, both in terms of time scales and dimensions, and thus every measurement taken has to be tailored to the phenomenon being studied. Every measurement can be considered as discrete when you deal with phenomena that occur in attoseconds or even less! Also, no matter your measuring technique, you always have a non-zero time-integration window, such as in this case where it is 30 minutes.\n\nBasically, the only criterion to establish whether a measurement's sampling rate is sufficient for your application, is to know the timescale of what you are trying to measure, you can then refer to the [Nyquist frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency) to determine your minimal sampling rate.\n\nLinking this to the problem at hand, if you're trying to determine how long the lights were turned on on a circuit (assuming no other power draws, to make it simpler), a sampling rate of 50Hz is not necessary, since lights are never turned on for 1/50th of a second. In that case, a 5 or 10 min sampling rate would be quite adequate, and 30 minutes still gives you a very valid approximation (see large hump in chart).\n\nNow then, if you want to know at what exact time a specific computer was turned on, and you know that this computer's power supply induces some specific high-frequency noise pattern in the lines when turned on, you need a very high sampling rate (much more than 50Hz) to be able to cross-correlate the PSU's noise signature with the measured signal. Again, it all depends on what you're trying to measure!\n\nFinally, I agree with you that the straight lines between the points are not the best way of representing this data for such a short period of time, and that a scatter plot would be better. However, I disagree that it has anything to do with the measurements being discrete or not, as all measurements are discrete and time-integrated by their nature. I believe it is mostly a matter of aesthetics and of readability. If the measurements were over a period of 50 years, or even a million years, then there would be no visual difference between using a scatter plot or a line, as the points could not be resolved by eye anyways. It's all a matter of scale!\n\nSorry, I know I'm basically only nitpicking over the meaning of discrete vs continuous - no ill intentions! :)\n ", "id": "dah0sru"}, {"comment": "No need to apologize.

I think the context is important though.\n\nSmart metering, in its current implementation, is only concerned with the high level monitoring, i.e. aggregated energy consumption of a building. There is no real need to even measure the power at a higher sampling interval than 10 seconds. (in this implementation)\n\nHigher frequency sampling is important in power quality analysis or, related to smart metering, if you are trying to decompose the aggregate signal into appliance level measurements. Here, the sampling rate could be say, from 1Hz up to the Mhz range, if you want to analyse higher harmonics to determine the device power signatures. \n\nSo, if the data point between two points is of no significance in your analysis then a line could be used, otherwise points would be better. \n \n\n\n", "id": "dahiugg"}, {"comment": ">What if there is a device that is only switched on for a few microseconds?

From that definition, a discrete quantity would be, for example, the number of people in a room, or the number of grains of sand in a bucket, as they can only take discrete values.\n\nThis has nothing to do with sampling rate, but rather with the nature of the quantity being measured. The measurement limitations referred to here are the fact that measuring instruments have a limited number of significant digits, and thus the values read from them are discretized. For instance the voltage display on a multi-meter with four digits may only take 10,000 different values , from 0000 to 9999 (37,000 if you consider the moving decimal point : 0.000 to 9.999, 10.00 to 99.99, 100.0 to 999.9 and 1000 to 9999).", "id": "dai5c4t"}, {"comment": "Yes. I agree that sampling produces discrete values even if the phenomenon being measured is continuous such as electrical current, mass flow rate of a fluid, audio signal etc.\n\nAny digital instrument no matter how how sensitive and precise will always produce discrete values. What the last statement in that quotation means, is that in spite of this, we still consider the values to be continuous. The reason is that the limitation is due to the measuring device.

A team of human analysts reviews the articles and makes sure that the computer coded each tag correctly, and inputs them into the dataset.\n\nThis is a useful way to build rapidly evolving or particularly massive datasets, but there are some issues. You are relying on the news to be perfectly accurate (it's  not), the computer to code correctly (it often doesn't) and the analysts to resolve or eliminate the errors (this is almost impossible to do perfectly, especially from a desk in DC).

There are some 'democratic' rebel groups left, but they are small and an insignificant minority. A rebel win in the civil war would surely mean an Islamic state with strict Sharia Law.

Vacation benefits ranged from 2 to 5 weeks per year, 401k matching ranged from 2% to 10%, and don't get me started on healthcare premiums. I also did not include minor bonuses like when a team nominates you for a $100 or $500 \"high-five\" award ... there were never very common. I also have worked from home since 2006 which is a benefit that is hard to quantify. It's not priceless but it sure makes it hard to talk to potentials employers that don't allow that kind of thing. I would say that in general, the total benefits did not differ much over all ... e.g., a firm that offers 5 weeks of vacation will probably contribute less to your 401k. \n  \nI paid for my MBA out of my own earnings and received no employer benefits for that.  \n  \nEDIT: I was just looking at this and the dips.

That is why the amount varied so much from year to year.  \n  \nThe dip in 1999 was caused by my job change ... my old employer paid us every two weeks and the new employer paid us in arrears (is that the right word?) So it is likely that a month of pay was pushed into 2000 making 1999 look like a bad year. This isn't really the case. 1998 may have been a busy year and included some O/T/ I have never had a salary pay cut.

It was this cliff that made 2000-2020 actually quite predicable.  For example the Real Estate crash of 2008 was predicted qualitatively in 1985-1990 because of the cliff and the demographics of home ownership back at that time.  Basically there was going to be a glut of housing even without the Fed goosing up the market!  This also tells us that the rumors that banks are holding back foreclosed properties was and still is almost certainly the truth and that current real estate prices are artificially elevated to this day.  (E.g. Jesus H Christ SF Bay Area!!  Bubble much?!)  \n\nContributing to this include: \n\n* Boomers transition out of the classic \"real estate buying mode\" circa 2000-2005\n* Boomers owning an average of >1 home per capita as vacation homes, investments, etc. which are starting to be liquidated\n* Boomers having smaller families so having fewer or no heirs to pass these properties to\n* GenX, GenY and Millenials being smaller demographics thus not being able to absorb the glut\n* GenX, GenY and Millenials (not entirely predicted but now known as fact) having far more expenses/debts and lesser income than Boomers per capita thus having far less wherewithal to buy even 1 home per capita, thus the imbalance being ever larger\n\nA related predication made back then: the rise of health care as a business because the older boomers will have that as their primary expense.  Transitioning to old age naturally brings this on.  Eventually as enough die, things will swing away from health care (circa 2030 and later)\n\nThis also has other implications.  For example in STEM, there is a \"generational gap\" that opened up in the early 1990s when there was substantially fewer candidates, a transition of major outsourcing (the US lost semiconductor manufacturing at this time) and companies seeking \"low capital R&D\" like software rather than hardware.  Now there's a bimodal distribution in STEM: over 50, and then 21-35.\n\nThe result is most \"old school\" scientists and engineers either have been retiring, did retire or even died without passing on their professional knowledge and experience because there was no one to mentor and hand-off know-how to.  In many cases, small businesses are liquidated instead of being sold or passed onto younger up-coming engineers. \n\nMuch professional knowledge has been lost and will still be lost, dying with the older demographic group.  This contributes to the loss of STEM ecosystem required to innovate.  Part of the reason Shenzhen dominates is because they took much of that knowledge and continue to pass it on - to younger Chinese obviously.\n\nThis gap is also probably related to the dearth of start-ups and new business formation in the 2000s (for the first time since such things were recorded).  Prior to 1995, most jobs were created by companies with fewer than 50 employers that were younger than 10 years old.  That corporate demographic pretty much disappeared with the cross-over to large Fortune 100 companies \"dominating\" job creation instead.  Of course, they can't and don't hire nearly enough hence the jobless recovery had a lot to do with this as well.", "id": "damj6gz"}, {"comment": "Wow, very interesting post. The transition in STEM rings true working as 32yo R&D Scientist at a very large f100 company; most of the engineers working in my dept are nearing retirement age but the replacements are never hired until people actually leave, so no overlap or mentorship.

We stretched our budgets to the max to hire new post-boomer people, but now...it's all about death or retirement.\n\nThis was predicted by various academics back in 1970-1980 but of course, as a society, we didn't plan for that.  The US of A does not plan.  We work in 4 year cycles.  We don't pay attention to demographics.  We don't think about what different age groups might need.

With parental consent and/or the consent of a judge, males can marry at age **fourteen** and females at age **twelve**. Common law marriage is recognized.\n\n*Massachusetts*: The age of consent is sixteen. With parental consent and/or the consent of a judge, males can marry at **fourteen** years of age and females can marry at the age of **twelve**. On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to recognize same-sex marriage. Common law marriage is not recognized.\n\n*New Hampshire*: The age of consent is sixteen. With parental consent and the consent of the judge, males can marry at age **fourteen** and females can marry at age **thirteen**. Common law marriage is not recognized.\n\nThere's a few more, but I won't bore everyone.
