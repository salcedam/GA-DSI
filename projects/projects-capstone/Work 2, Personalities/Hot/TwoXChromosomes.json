Also if he is setting his own business up then those credentials will be largely irrelevant as his business will operate on word of mouth and past performance (outside of any technical certifications he may need). \n\nI really do think that if your partner knows about your views on this then he might be going through a horrible time trying to figure out how not lose the person he loves. I'm not saying you should promise to stick with him no matter what, because you have to be happy too, but if you do decide it's not an issue then let him know. Let him be able to be honest without the fear that you will leave him or think any less of him if he chooses not to pursue an academic life. You seem to really love him, don't take it for granted you'll find someone else like him. Can you imagine how you would feel if you never connect with anyone like that again, and you threw him aside because of his academic performance? \n\nHey good luck, I hope he's able to open up to you and you can both move forward with your life, hopefully together. I think the first big step is in letting him know he won't lose you and you won't think anything less of him or love him any less just because of his grades.

At the same time not having a degree does not mean you're destined for a life of failure and doom.\n\nSimilarly - just because your dad struggled does not mean that you or he will.\n\nIf you really love this guy you need to sit down with him and have an honest and open conversation about what is going on. Be kind, calm, and listen. Don't get angry. If you really want to mary him you're going to have to work together as a team.\n\nI think you need to find out why he is failing school. You love him and think highly enough of him to want to marry him - so the reason is obviously not that he is \"too dumb\" or anything like that. Maybe the program he is in isn't good? What is it really like? Maybe he deep down really doesn't want to be in this career field? Maybe there is something else that he is more passionate about? Is it possible that he is depressed? Or has some other thing that has not been diagnosed? Such as PTSD? Has he suffered a significant event in his life? A trauma? Could he have a learning disability? An addiction?\n\nThe fact is that no normal healthy human being wants to fail or let down their significant other, etc. There is something else going on here. He might not even know what is wrong.\n\n\"I used to be adamant that I wouldn't marry anyone who didn't graduate college.\" Yeah!! I was taught this at a very young age. That men who are not college graduates are \"beneath me\" and I should NEVER marry a loser like that!! Well... what a terrible thing to say!!\n\nI don't think you should push him to finish school - instead you need to find out what is going on. Don't judge. This is not about good/bad or stupid/smart, etc. It is about finding a solution. You never know - maybe he has some hidden talent for something that just needs some push to come out.

If so, do you have a pump so that you can build up enough for the baby for a few days? Because of the drugs from the surgery, you won't be able to nurse the rest of the day of the surgery and the next day.

Lifting the baby was fine though. I was sore. I'm sure having this surgery within a few months of something like childbirth is never great, right? :-) I was also in my late 30s, so the body takes a little longer to recover.  I remember being surprised at how sore and wiped out I was for that day and the next. The following week back to work I had to go to an event where I was on my feet for most of the day, and I was pretty sore by the end of the day. But other than that i felt back to normal pretty quickly.  \n\nI did not have any issue with supply. You hopefully won't either! \n\nMy OB said due to the medications, not to breastfeed for 24 hours after the surgery and then 6 hours after I stopped the pain meds (I can't remember which one though).  However, looking at the Kellymom website now, it looks like people regularly breastfeed coming out of anesthesia and studies have shown no issues. So I could have had a doctor that was overly cautious, or didn't know what she was talking about, or the recommendations have just changed again. I am normally someone that looks into different opinions, but I was pretty much sleeping those 24 hours after, I just didn't even care about it.

I felt like I never even knew him.  I felt like my life was over.\n\nI'm fine now...or like 98% fine.  Here's my advice:\n\n1.  Let yourself cry.  I tried not to for so long and I think it made it worse.  I so wanted to be that girl that didn't let shit like this bother me, I'm not.  Crying it out helped.\n\n2.  Focus on things that make you happy.  Friends, family, hobbies.  I threw myself back into my art and started traveling.  Two things he never had any interest in.\n\n3.  If you have the means, go to therapy.  I know it's not for everyone but my therapist gave me perspective when I was lost.  She suggested thinking about him in black and white.  It helps you let go if you always think of it as the past.  Think of things in the present in vivid color.\n\n4.  Mourn the relationship you THOUGHT you had and the one you ACTUALLY had.  This is big.  You guys had already had time apart...are you sad over the actual relationship or the idea of what the relationship was?\n\n5.  Date.  I forced myself to do this.

We were engaged but had been having problems for about 6 months leading up to that (very long story.)  We were trying to work things out, or so I thought, and then he told me had started seeing someone and that she had moved in after a week.  A week.  And they are still together.\n\nThat was in July.  I was crushed, damn near suicidal, confused, hurt, nauseaous, panicked, etc.  I felt like our whole relationship was a lie.  And all that time with him was wasted!  I compared myself to this new girl repeatedly.  Why wasn't I good enough for him?  What about her was so much better than me?  We were supposed to get married! They moved in together so quick!  I felt like I never even knew him.  I felt like my life was over.\n\nI'm fine now...or like 98% fine.  Here's my advice:\n\n1.  Let yourself cry.  I tried not to for so long and I think it made it worse.  I so wanted to be that girl that didn't let shit like this bother me, I'm not.  Crying it out helped.\n\n2.  Focus on things that make you happy.  Friends, family, hobbies.  I threw myself back into my art and started traveling.  Two things he never had any interest in.\n\n3.  If you have the means, go to therapy.  I know it's not for everyone but my therapist gave me perspective when I was lost.  She suggested thinking about him in black and white.  It helps you let go if you always think of it as the past.  Think of things in the present in vivid color.\n\n4.  Mourn the relationship you THOUGHT you had and the one you ACTUALLY had.  This is big.  You guys had already had time apart...are you sad over the actual relationship or the idea of what the relationship was?\n\n5.  Date.  I forced myself to do this.  I haven't gotten into anything serious but it will remind you that there are other people in the world and you might meet someone really great.\n\n6.  Do things for yourself.  I set goals and reward myself when I hit that goal.  It can be something silly or something serious.  I used to be terrified of flying.  I've traveled enough in the last 4 months that I've gotten over that.  I went to places I always wanted to but he never did.  What have you always wanted to do?  Do it!\n\n7.  I would maintain no contact.  You might have a friendship with him later but for now talking to him is only going to torture you.  Right now you just need to focus on you and healing.\n\n8.  Don't beat yourself up if you think you've gotten over it and then you slip back into being upset.  This was discouraging for me.  I was fine until what would have been our anniversary and then I was a mess for a few days.  That's normal and you'll get over it.  Cry when you need to and move on.\n\nIt takes time but every day gets a little better.  You deserve better.  Keep that in mind!\n\n\n", "id": "dar7xli"}]]], "5gbl7w": ["Signs of jealousy in a friend?", "2016-12-03 23:37:33", 1, "https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/5gbl7w/signs_of_jealousy_in_a_friend/", [[2, "She sounds like a petty basic bitch u shouldnt have a friendship with."], [2, "She's a whiny little brat.\n\nEdit: But I think you should ask her directly if something's wrong.

When I was in the dating pool, if a guy lived at home in his mid twenties it was a bit of a turn off for me because there is a certain life experience you get outside of your parents home and into your own independent adult life. I can't speak for all girls but I think this will be really good for you.  Cooking lessons are also a great plan!

Personally I lost my virginity at a stupidly young age, he strung me along and took a LOT of other girls virginity too. He made it feel like it didn't matter at all. I will always regret that, I will always wish I could have changed that decision so please be careful. I took a boys virginity when I was younger and swore that his is the only one that I would. I wouldn't make him feel like it was something that didn't matter to me, to the point that when I was older at a party I was getting close to a guy then found out he was a virgin, even in my drunk state I wouldn't sleep with him.\n\nThere is no shame in being 26 and not having had a \"proper\" relationship yet, take it from someone who's been on more than her fair share of dates! I was searching too hard and it  was worthless because it turns out the guy I was looking for worked in the video game shop down the road! \nSam was 25 when I met him and we'd both been in long term relationships and casual short ones, but nothing could prepare us for the 2 years we've just had, life is unpredictable and no amount of preparation will prepare you for some things. If you find someone who will stick by you, no matter where you live, if you're rich or poor or if you can't cook yet, you'll be on the right track.\n\nThe best piece of advice for dating is that it's not a movie, you might not get butterfly's, conversations may struggle, and their WILL be awkward silences! Also, the first time she farts in front of you, it's a big thing, she trusts you.... or she giggles too hard and didn't mean too :P\n", "id": "daqi1b7"}], [{"comment": "I think if you talked to a girl openly and honestly about yourself and your feelings like you did in this post, it would be really great.

When I was in the dating pool, if a guy lived at home in his mid twenties it was a bit of a turn off for me because there is a certain life experience you get outside of your parents home and into your own independent adult life.

I understand every single thing you've said... I'm curious as to your current age.  My brother was 14 when he first raped me. I was 10.  He convinced me that Dad would kill him if I told and therefore Dad would go to prison if I told.  It took me 4 years of abuse from him before I mustered the courage/anger/confidence it took to make him finally stop.  I told no one for 40 years. I felt it was my responsibility to hold the family together.  That childhood abuse caused me to become a lifelong victim.  I married my high school sweetheart at 18 despite regular abuse and continued to be abused mentally, physically and emotionally for 36 years.  I was groomed to be a victim.  I was outwardly a successful person professionally and socially but was dead inside.  My husband eventually died, and that was the first time I was able to truly deal with the weight of all of it.  Don't let what you went through make you become a lifelong victim.  It may seem like the best thing is to ignore it or pretend it never happened.  In the long run, it's not.

As a 4-5 year old (possibly younger) I had a half brother my mother made me share a room with who touched me all the time.

That just fucked me up even more, leaving me to act out any way I knew how and could get away with. Luckily, and I know this is harsh but because of my half brother's troubled ways he ended up in jail (for statutory rape with a 14 year old while he was 22, not surprising one bit) and somehow ended up killed. It came as a major shock to the family, and as a 13 year old entering high school it was really tough emotionally to see my mom go through the grievance.

No, it is not normal behavior. My older brother, at that age, had a very low IQ and couldn't see anything wrong with trying to have sex with anyone that was not his own mother. None of the other boys I knew of that age behaved that way. I know he was molested as a kid, by a local park gardener who would bribe him with soda, because he was so vulnerable and was not supervised properly himself. Children in my era had considerably less supervision than now and the rates of molestation were higher but not talked about. Because it was kept quiet, children and parents were caught unaware. And that affliction was replayed in each following generation. Now though, with the internet, kids being driven everywhere they go, a generation of adults and laws trying to put an end to child abuse, and greater societal expectations for child protection in general, there is no excuse for his ignorance. His parents are responsible too, and anyone who molested him if that even happened. Maybe he's just a selfish asshole who has never experienced hard times or enough character-building discipline. It seems he took a chance and got away with it for whatever reason. Let this be like a game of Dominoes. I think you should try to get some justice and closure or else you could carry that injury with you for a long time and it could continue to reflect upon your life like a mirror to your soul, plus you could end up hurting other innocent persons by inadvertently taking your anger out on them. Bottling up your anger is also the fastest way to become depressed. I think he needs to be embarrassed in front of everyone and then he needs to be exiled. If no one else is around (prince charming lol) we have to defend our own innocence and to set the standard for everyone who follows us through time and meets us in the future, especially women sometimes. Taking a stand does not make you less of a woman, it makes you more of a woman. More in control of your own actions, more able with experience to graciously deal with corrupt people effectively, more able to spot trouble, more able to trust and respect your self for being brave and true. You are young but you still need to place limits on society through our own small efforts. This is your world. This is your life. Yes, we change our selves through this process too. We change into people who believe in justice and the right to be innocent without fear of molestation. Honestly, if we all thought molestation was okay, we wouldn't want to live in the protective, yet cramped, folds of society where help is only a cry away. Any effort you make to get some justice will benefit all women and children. I'm not saying you should save the world. I'm saying you maybe should defend your own honor if possible. You have to be smart about how you seek closure though. The court system may be the proper route for you, charging him with statutory rape, but then again it may only serve to cause you more pain and anguish. I'm not advocating that you do harm to yourself. And, seriously, don't do things that are immoral or illegal. You'll regret it every time. Regain and eventually maintain your dignity in the face of all odds, it's what you feel you've lost by his actions. Traditions of public embarrassment and then exile are the most effective punishments. I say tell everyone in the family what he did. That's my personality now; I'm stubborn and have been through a lot. I say, repeat it to them until you get the proper response. Someone needs to care and to apologize to you (namely, him and his parents). Turn the tide of shame, embarrassment, and isolation back onto him. Don't stop. Wear them down if necessary.

I was forced to have him ejaculate semen on me and inside of me. I was just a boy back then and I was scared with my sister as well. It went on for a couple of years until my mom found out and got the police department involved. \n\nI know he is out of prison; he has been for a while.

The one thing she said, that stopped me in my tracks, was her saying that she felt shame and disgust and that when everyone tells you that it's wrong and bad and to tell an adult no one tells you sometimes it feels good. That will make you think that you must be bad for having liked the feeling. This made me realize I was not bad. That sex does feel good even sometimes when it shouldn't. \n\nFast forward to 42.

Simply because this is something that has eaten at me my entire life. I was molested throughout most of my childhood. Since i was about 6 years old, by different men including my 5th grade teacher (he was my teacher and also the principal) When i was 12 my mom brought me to the U.S and i thought it was finally over. My mom was married and with a daughter. I never had a relationship with my bio dad and so stupid 12 year old me started to get closed to my stepdad. Seeking the fatherly love i never had and yea, you guessed it. He too abused me. I told my mom of course and she kicked him out for 2 whole months. He never went to jail and he came back to live with us. I one time did dared to complain to my mom only to be hit with \"he doesn't mess with you anymore and i can't do that to your sister\"\n\nMy mom would always say that \"your sister this, your sister that\" it came to a point where i truly felt like i hated my sister. My mind kept screaming \"WHAT ABOUT ME\" So he lived with us for a few more years. When i was 16 i was about to go to school when he hugged me said he was in love with me and tried to kiss me. I pushed him away. Ran to my school bus and then told my mom. Again.\n\nHe left once more for about 2 years this time. He came back when i was 18 and when i turned 19 my mom kicked me out of the house.\n\nMost of my close friends know about what happened with my stepdad. But they don't know about the rest. The teacher, my aunt's boyfriend, the family friend, the distant cousin. No one knows. Well i guess now you know reddit.\n\nThis kind of thing. It destroys a person. It broke me. All my life i had such low self steem. Struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts. I buried myself in books and to this day i am both proud and shocked that i did not turned to drugs. But make no mistake. I am fucked up. I have always felt broken and i always blamed myself. For not saying anything to stop them, for sometimes liking it. Oh god. My body reacted and i hate myself everyday for it. For finding some disgusting things arousing. I know it's wrong but i can't help it and i feel disgusting and sick for it.\n\nThat is my deepest secret that i will probably never ever tell anyone who actually knows me irl.\n\nIt is sickening to see how many of us have gone through this. I was so young and i truly didn't know better. I didn't even know what sex was, and every single one of the men who did that to me would always always say something along the lines of \"don't tell anyone, this is a secret if you tell i'll go to jail. You don't want me to go to jail right?\" i was scared and confused. I was a child and to this day i wonder why. Because it wasn't just one man. There were 4 before i moved to the U.S and then one more. Did the 4 guys in my country talked to each other? did they know each other? or was it something i did? something i said? since i was 6 until i left at the age of 12 and then to come here and have it happen again.

Most days I am at peace and it doesn't hurt.\n\nAnd then this summer, when I was living with my parents while I was between jobs/cities, I went out with a friend, her boyfriend, and his friend in a nearby town. We were drinking, and I was a couple in at that point. The boyfriend's friend was a misogynistic asshole who said something about women making things up, **and I lost it**. Triggered is absolutely the appropriate word for what happened because before I knew it, I had reamed him out, arubtly left the table, rounded a corner, burst into tears, and called my parents to pick me up because I *needed* to leave immediately and couldn't stay over there like I had planned. They came and got me, and I basically cried the whole way home, hyperventilating- mostly because I was terrified of finally talking to them about something that I had largely repressed for 8 years.\n\nWhen I got home, I told them what happened- the biggest things they expressed to me after were 1) how sorry they were that this happened to me; 2) how they felt so bad that they couldn't have protected me and been there for me when it happened, even though they understood why I hadn't said anything and didn't blame me; 3) how glad they were that I told them now, and that they could help me get out of a distressing situation; and 4) this had absolutely no impact on how they viewed me and they loved me so much.\n\nWhile there definitely could have been much less emotionally draining ways to let my parents know about what had happened to me, I can't say I regret that my freakout forced me to do it.

No, it is not normal behavior. My older brother, at that age, had a very low IQ and couldn't see anything wrong with trying to have sex with anyone that was not his own mother. None of the other boys I knew of that age behaved that way. I know he was molested as a kid, by a local park gardener who would bribe him with soda, because he was so vulnerable and was not supervised properly himself. Children in my era had considerably less supervision than now and the rates of molestation were higher but not talked about. Because it was kept quiet, children and parents were caught unaware. And that affliction was replayed in each following generation. Now though, with the internet, kids being driven everywhere they go, a generation of adults and laws trying to put an end to child abuse, and greater societal expectations for child protection in general, there is no excuse for his ignorance. His parents are responsible too, and anyone who molested him if that even happened. Maybe he's just a selfish asshole who has never experienced hard times or enough character-building discipline. It seems he took a chance and got away with it for whatever reason. Let this be like a game of Dominoes. I think you should try to get some justice and closure or else you could carry that injury with you for a long time and it could continue to reflect upon your life like a mirror to your soul, plus you could end up hurting other innocent persons by inadvertently taking your anger out on them. Bottling up your anger is also the fastest way to become depressed. I think he needs to be embarrassed in front of everyone and then he needs to be exiled. If no one else is around (prince charming lol) we have to defend our own innocence and to set the standard for everyone who follows us through time and meets us in the future, especially women sometimes. Taking a stand does not make you less of a woman, it makes you more of a woman. More in control of your own actions, more able with experience to graciously deal with corrupt people effectively, more able to spot trouble, more able to trust and respect your self for being brave and true. You are young but you still need to place limits on society through our own small efforts. This is your world. This is your life. Yes, we change our selves through this process too. We change into people who believe in justice and the right to be innocent without fear of molestation. Honestly, if we all thought molestation was okay, we wouldn't want to live in the protective, yet cramped, folds of society where help is only a cry away. Any effort you make to get some justice will benefit all women and children. I'm not saying you should save the world. I'm saying you maybe should defend your own honor if possible. You have to be smart about how you seek closure though. The court system may be the proper route for you, charging him with statutory rape, but then again it may only serve to cause you more pain and anguish. I'm not advocating that you do harm to yourself. And, seriously, don't do things that are immoral or illegal. You'll regret it every time. Regain and eventually maintain your dignity in the face of all odds, it's what you feel you've lost by his actions. Traditions of public embarrassment and then exile are the most effective punishments. I say tell everyone in the family what he did. That's my personality now; I'm stubborn and have been through a lot. I say, repeat it to them until you get the proper response. Someone needs to care and to apologize to you (namely, him and his parents). Turn the tide of shame, embarrassment, and isolation back onto him. Don't stop. Wear them down if necessary.

It wasn't proper abuse. Why couldn't I just get over it? \n\nI'm nearly 25 and told my parents last year. It was the scariest thing I'd ever done, but telling them- while they didn't always respond the way I needed them to- was one of the first, small steps that helped me to start to heal and to admit that I'd been abused. To admit that it wasn't my fault and that I deserve to be respected and treated compassionately. \n\nIt took time though. Shortly after telling my folks I saw him in a supermarket. His smirk rocketed me back to being 9, terrified and confused all over again. I was drinking a lot and tried to end it all.

Simply because this is something that has eaten at me my entire life. I was molested throughout most of my childhood. Since i was about 6 years old, by different men including my 5th grade teacher (he was my teacher and also the principal) When i was 12 my mom brought me to the U.S and i thought it was finally over. My mom was married and with a daughter. I never had a relationship with my bio dad and so stupid 12 year old me started to get closed to my stepdad. Seeking the fatherly love i never had and yea, you guessed it. He too abused me. I told my mom of course and she kicked him out for 2 whole months. He never went to jail and he came back to live with us. I one time did dared to complain to my mom only to be hit with \"he doesn't mess with you anymore and i can't do that to your sister\"\n\nMy mom would always say that \"your sister this, your sister that\" it came to a point where i truly felt like i hated my sister. My mind kept screaming \"WHAT ABOUT ME\" So he lived with us for a few more years. When i was 16 i was about to go to school when he hugged me said he was in love with me and tried to kiss me. I pushed him away. Ran to my school bus and then told my mom. Again.\n\nHe left once more for about 2 years this time. He came back when i was 18 and when i turned 19 my mom kicked me out of the house.\n\nMost of my close friends know about what happened with my stepdad. But they don't know about the rest. The teacher, my aunt's boyfriend, the family friend, the distant cousin. No one knows. Well i guess now you know reddit.\n\nThis kind of thing. It destroys a person. It broke me. All my life i had such low self steem. Struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts. I buried myself in books and to this day i am both proud and shocked that i did not turned to drugs. But make no mistake. I am fucked up. I have always felt broken and i always blamed myself. For not saying anything to stop them, for sometimes liking it. Oh god.

Here are some of the things I learned:\n\n- Don't badmouth your ex in front of your child, ever, no matter what the reason.  Children are remarkably perceptive; what you say can and will be stored away and trotted out later.  If you badmouth someone they care about, they will think less of you.  My ex heavily badmouthed me to (and around) my son. The net effect was that it severely damaged their relationship.  How would it make you feel for someone to say horrible things about someone you love?\n\n- My son often asked why we had divorced (since I had left his father when he was 14 months old he had no memory of it).  Refusing to discuss the issue or trying to put him off until he was older only encouraged him to ask me more.  As suggested by others, I used age-appropriate language, and tried to be very neutral about what I said.  With a talkative child, you can count on every word you say getting repeated to the other parent, especially if the other parent is specifically digging for things to use against you (yes, my ex actually did this).\n\n- If your ex is a huge douchenozzle (heh), your daughter will eventually figure this out on her own.  I personally feel that it's better to let the child come to this opinion on their own, rather than hearing it from you, as it's then a determination based entirely on the other parent's behavior.  (This of course assumes that the child is safe in their custody, but that's out of the scope of this discussion, I think) \n\nMy son is in his twenties now, lives on his own and is a well-adjusted person; we have a good relationship, he and his girlfriend come over for dinner every now and then, and we text and email regularly.  On the other hand, he cut off all contact with his father when he was fifteen, and hasn't heard from him since he was eighteen.  He's got a surprisingly zen attitude about the whole experience now too.  We had a conversation about a year ago in which he said he'd found out his father remarried and had another son.  I asked him if he had any desire to get in contact with them, and he said \"No, but I hope that he's learned from things and can be a good dad now.\""], [7, "She's still little so keep it super simple and age-appropriate. She's  too young to process the details and probably will be for a while. That also buys you some time to continue processing it yourself and to decide how you want to approach it.\n\nI like the other commenter's suggestion of saying \n\n\"sometimes someone is your friend but they do something that upsets you and they aren't your friend anymore.\"\n\nIt's simple enough and will probably satisfy her curiosity. I would avoid speaking negatively about her father to her, it could backfire and actually make things worse for you. \n\nSorry. It sounds like he's a huge douchenozzle and totally deserves it but I've seen a lot of these situations. The Mom is usually the custodial parent who has to do the disciplining and the hard part of childrearing and the Dad gets to be the \"cool\" weekend parent so it's easier from a child's perspective to see you as the bad guy. It isn't right, but it's often true. (Not sure if that's the case in your situation, but just something to consider when you speak about it.)\n\nAs she gets older, you can feed her bits and pieces of the truth, hopefully with the guidance of a family therapist who can suggest the right words. \n\nSorry you went through this.

That works for now.\n\nI would wait until your daughter is AT LEAST an adult before you share the nature of her father's behaviour, and even then you should probably take into consideration what kind of relationship she has with him at that time.

Bottom line. \n\nSo the way to say it is something like \"once upon a time, we loved each other, and this is how you came into the world.

Here are some of the things I learned:\n\n- Don't badmouth your ex in front of your child, ever, no matter what the reason.  Children are remarkably perceptive; what you say can and will be stored away and trotted out later.  If you badmouth someone they care about, they will think less of you.  My ex heavily badmouthed me to (and around) my son. The net effect was that it severely damaged their relationship.  How would it make you feel for someone to say horrible things about someone you love?\n\n- My son often asked why we had divorced (since I had left his father when he was 14 months old he had no memory of it).  Refusing to discuss the issue or trying to put him off until he was older only encouraged him to ask me more.  As suggested by others, I used age-appropriate language, and tried to be very neutral about what I said.  With a talkative child, you can count on every word you say getting repeated to the other parent, especially if the other parent is specifically digging for things to use against you (yes, my ex actually did this).\n\n- If your ex is a huge douchenozzle (heh), your daughter will eventually figure this out on her own.  I personally feel that it's better to let the child come to this opinion on their own, rather than hearing it from you, as it's then a determination based entirely on the other parent's behavior.  (This of course assumes that the child is safe in their custody, but that's out of the scope of this discussion, I think) \n\nMy son is in his twenties now, lives on his own and is a well-adjusted person; we have a good relationship, he and his girlfriend come over for dinner every now and then, and we text and email regularly.  On the other hand, he cut off all contact with his father when he was fifteen, and hasn't heard from him since he was eighteen.  He's got a surprisingly zen attitude about the whole experience now too.  We had a conversation about a year ago in which he said he'd found out his father remarried and had another son.  I asked him if he had any desire to get in contact with them, and he said \"No, but I hope that he's learned from things and can be a good dad now.\"", "id": "dapeeaz"}, {"comment": "Yes - I try very hard not to badmouth (I occasionally say things like I know he is a messy person when she mentions this about his apartment.)

I would avoid speaking negatively about her father to her, it could backfire and actually make things worse for you. \n\nSorry. It sounds like he's a huge douchenozzle and totally deserves it but I've seen a lot of these situations. The Mom is usually the custodial parent who has to do the disciplining and the hard part of childrearing and the Dad gets to be the \"cool\" weekend parent so it's easier from a child's perspective to see you as the bad guy. It isn't right, but it's often true.

Sucking at something is the first step to not sucking.\n\n20's are for figuring out shit on your own, and beginning to figure out who you are (this takes a lifetime).

Nobody has a life of smooth sailing. \n\nWhat defines us though is how we react to our fuckups. Like taking ownership of when we have made mistakes and make a plan to fix them, or realizing that you are with someone who's bad for you and leaving them.

I can't say that the things we did have any effect in our relationship as brothers, as he is still very dear to my heart and we talk every week.

My best friend to this day, has a sister who was raped when she was young. She was being raped by her dad and uncle. Her brother (my best friend) found out because he actually saw it happen. He told me because he didn't know what to do. He wanted to kill his dad, but I told him to tell his mom immediately and she would call the cops. We cut school and went to his mom job. I'll never forget this day because it shocked me. His mom left work, picked up his sister from school, and instead of going to the cops, began to scold his sister and blame her for the dad raping her. His sister who was in tears told her at this time that her uncle was doing it too, and sometimes they would do it at the same time. Her mom blamed her even more and said it had to be her fault, if both of them was doing it. Her logic was what's the chances of both of them doing it without her having a big role in it. So my point is, sometimes, even your own parents won't believe you. Just stay strong, and you will get through. It took a lot of counseling and support for her to realize it was not her fault and there's always a listening ear somewhere.

She never has.\n\n\nMy mother is amazing and I am thankful for her every day <3", "id": "darfc2g"}, {"comment": "I feel for her so much.  I was raped when I was 5 by my mom's supposed little brother.  He was 12 or 13 at the time. Turns out I found out  later overhearing my mom and her sisters that he wad actually the son of my aunt born when she was a teenager and pieced it fully together many years later when my mom finally admitted her father sexually assaulted her and her sisters most of their lives.  I am firmly of the belief he was my cousin and my uncle and to hide the scandal of it in the small town the mom went away for a bit and pretended she had the baby and let the monster keep on at it.\n\nI didn't tell my mom until after I had overheard my aunts the previous summer (at this point not knowing about grandpa) when we got into a huge argument because I had bad IBD but no one would diagnose it or seem to care.  Mom would constantly accuse me of being a slut and pregnant.  Except for the childhood rapes I had never been with anyone so this shocked me and was so hurtful.  Not only was no one taking these 2 to 3 week long horrendously painful bouts of spastic colon cramping, diarrhea and vomiting everything I ate but I learned to stop telling her because of her tirades.  I was never allowed to stay after school for any activities or anything either so I guess she thought I was sneaking off during class with the football team.\n\nAnyway I finally snapped and told her I couldn't let a boy or man touch me and indeed I was very uncomfortable with hugs from my dad or sitting too close to anyone something maybe she or dad might have noticed of they paid attention.  I forgave her much after I learned of her nightly abuse by her own father who would sneak into their shares room with 4 daughters and pick one to rape next to the others.  She is seriously messed up. She would even go days without showers because even at 40 her memories of him creeping to watch his daughters shower lived with her memory without any respite.\n\nBut the day I told her she about slapped me in the face ans ranted and raved about how despicable I was to make up such a lie about her beloved \"brother\" whom she raised from an infant just to hurt her.  To this day she never really acknowledged she was wrong and only kind of apologized.\n\nI remember hearing her on the phone with my dad that night (he was traveling for business) and telling him thar she didn't know how they could have raised such an evil person as me.  I think he believed me but he never said a word about it except she got mad with him on the phone and cried much of the night and then everyone pretended it never happened.  As an adult I asked my dad why he just let me be repudiated and ignored and he said he felt it was best not to dredge it up. The past is the past.  If only.\n\nI am so happy OPs declaration was well received.  So many of us end up finding ourselves betrayed and forever further scarred when the people we trusted to protect us refuse to believe or worse collude.  My grandmother blamed her daughters for stealing his love with their slutty behavior.  Born bad and evil because she was not at fault in any way.\n\nWhat is a worse evil than being raped as a child?  Having other adults especially the other parent help them keep up the abuse, pretending blindness or participating.\n\nAnd I won't leave my son alone with anyone in my family.  And I am over protective.  I also worried when he was a baby that I would be sock and twisted too tho I never had such disgusting thoughts or urges aro7nd children.  I still felt and often feel filthy and forever tainted.  And when I am emotionally hurt I retreat.  It ruins relationships.  I also have intimacy issues.\n\nKnowing how insidious this and hearing now about pizzagate and the Belgium case I have to wonder if child abuse happens in a majority of children's lives =(  and all of it also makes me feel guilty for feeling so victimized yet these alleged cases the children are suffering so much worse than I did.  It's stupid but I can't help it.\n\nI also know I will kill someone before I allow myself or my child to be assaulted.  I realized this when I guess my abuser got out of prison (my aunts had been discussing this when I overheard and it was about 12 or 15 years later) and he called my cell phone under my mom's name asking for her.  She spells her name weird for the way she says it so I know it wasn't just a telemarketer or creditor ir whatever and the phone # was mine from the moment she got it.  I called my dad in a panic and he told me it was unlikely and I was being an over emotional and irrational woman.  Dismissed again.  And I was living alone in a city 3 hrs away.\n\nInterestingly I suffered the worst IBD attack of my life soon after.\n\nI will pray for us all tonight and thank you for sharing and letting me also.

He, being smart in that way, told me he would do the same thing to me if i did it to him. I didn't have a clue what he ment, so i did suck his ****. It wasn't even for like a couple of minutes, i remember me sucking him for hours upon hours, of course in the night. I remember him repaying me by sucking my **** as well, but instead he only did it for a couple of seconds and stopped, and i really didn't enjoy him doing it because it felt weird at the time. It started to be a casual thing, and he used to convince me, again I ABSOLUTELY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT I WAS DOING, i legit thought that everybody did that. He later did try to anal me, but it failed, of what i remember. He did ask me every time we did it to tell him if i didn't want to do it, and of course, me having no idea of what he was talking about, i never said stop. We did it for about 2 months, and we did it casually. I would say about 3 times a week, mostly at night and when my parents weren't home. I cant remember specifically why we stopped, probably he got bored, but to be honest, if it wouldn't have been because of him wanting to stop, i would have still done it until i noticed how wrong it was. I never have told anybody in my entire life about it, and i haven't spoken about it to my own brother since it happened.

"], [5, "You need to decide if you can have sex without needing to be in a relationship.\n\nOf course you got hurt after sex when you realized it was just about pussy for them. That's really dehumanizing and, even if consciously they were just dick for you, part of you hurts because you know your so much more than your genitals. \n\nI hate truly casual sex. It makes me feel bad about myself. Because I don't feel respected. But I also realized I don't need or even want emotions necessarily. And thats where I discovered the golden sweet spot: the fuck buddy.\n\nThe fuck buddy is a guy you really get along with but don't have an interest in dating eachother for whatever reason. Quite literally friends with benefits. The  key is you have to have a deal breaker be for you start. You need to be able to be really firm that you're not interested in him or else one of you is likely to catch feelings. \n\nFor me I would find guys where we got along but we were just totally fundamentally different. People I would be friends with and get along fine but the idea of dating them was just Blegh. What was most important was that we established trust and mutual respect. All the safe guards that come within sex in a relationship, just minus the relationship.\n\nYou can't have sex with a dude you kind of like and never define anything and hope it works out. It never will. You need to find a guy you like and then have a firm conversation about what both of you want, whether those wants are compatible, and if so, the expectations going forward.\n\nI had a fuck buddy where we agreed to be monogomous (we were both uncomfortable with the idea of performing unprotected oral if the other was sleeping with the people).\n\nIf you have emotional feelings, then you have to respect that and be honest with them. There's no wrong or right when it comes to being single. But I think the number one problem women have is they don't feel confident in asserting themselves and respecting their own desires. If you're sleeping with a guy and catch feels, tell him. If you want sex but get jealous easily, tell him. Figure out what you want and then demand it. You'll weed out the guys who aren't going to give it to you. You wouldnt just going with the flow and hope things turn out alright for you when it came to coursework or a haircut, why would you think it'd work for your sex life?\n\nI think whats happening is you're being a little too casual and it makes you feel disposable. That's shitty. Even if its not in a monogamous romantic relationship, you should always feel comfortable and safe with a sexual partner. If you cant have difficult conversations, you shouldn't be having sex with them.\n\nFind guys you like and get along with. Discuss what you want. Establish a relationship. Get familiar with eachother. Make sure he respects you and isnt gonna treat you poorly.\n\nThat said, if you're not dating a guy, you have to accept he might start dating someone else. If him ending his fling with you and dating someone else makes you sad, thats a *really* strong indicator you shouldn't have been having the fling to begin with. Its ok to have feelings. Dont deny them just because they're not what you wanted them to be. \n\nFucking around and toughening up is soul crushing and awful. Dont do that. Learning the difference between sexual intimacy and emotional intimacy and the relationship between the two (which varies for everybody) is an important lesson to learn. Learning to ask for what you want and walk away from situations that don't meet y out standards is also important to learn. Learning to listen to yourself and figuring out what you want is a lesson we never stop learning. It sounds like you've been trying to reach an end result without paying attention to the ingredients. You cant have a casual sexual relationship with someone you have feelings for. You can't have sex with someone who doesn't like you as a human being and be surprised it was just about sex for them. If you want to feel valued as a complete person, you need to put in the leg work and \"date\" some guys and find a good fit.\n\nI date completely normally. I find guys I really click with and am attracted to. I get to know them over the course of hanging out a few times. Sometimes I really have feelings and I tell them I like them. Sometimes I realize the connection is more shallow and tell them I don't want anything serious. I just always try to pay attention to what I want vs what I think I want. Sometimes I think I want sex and really I want someone to hold me and tell me they care about me. Sometimes I think I have feelings for a guy but in reality I just really like the sex and its clouding my judgement . \n\nI always keep a dude though. I always have that one fuck buddy who's just a stand up guy. A guy who is dependable (nothing worse than a booty call going unresponded to for hours). He's respectful. The sex is good. The conversation before and after the sex is good. And there's something that makes me not want to date him. He's my human dildo. I like the dick *and I also like the human it's attached to*. But I don't have feelings for him.\n\nBeing single is rough. Getting hurt sucks. Getting hurt is part of life. But it doesn't need to be part of your sex life. Figuring out why you're getting hurt and try out solutions. Figure out what works and what doesnt (and casual sex doesn't work for a lot of people. There's nothing wrong with needing emotional intimacy to be able to enjoy sexual intimacy. Its common and until *super* recently was the societal norm).

Separating sex from love is a whole lot of work and can be very painful, but realize that *you also* have the power to only want someone for sex. You don't owe your hookup partners any emotional investment; you're just using their company to satisfy your body's needs, same as they might be using yours. Coming to the place of, \"we did this because *I* wanted to; *I* am getting *my* needs met; it was *my* choice and *I* had fun,\" and moving away from \"he took advantage of me; I have no emotional worth to this person; I'm only useful as a sex object\" - that can be very empowering, and very peaceful. Take it from me, as a Scorpio-level horny butterface with one serious partner and a growing harem of FWBs (partner and I are poly and everyone knows about everything; it's all kosher) who also \"saved herself\" with the wrong man for way too long: taking agency over your own sex life and your own emotional well-being is AWESOME.\n\nI'm sorry I can't be more helpful with the \"how\" of this post, but I hope it helps you to know that it is possible to separate sex from the ideas of emotional attachment and self-valuation, and that there are women who grew up with the Disney-princess-Prince-Charming brainwashing who have done so. I got to this point via some drawn-out trauma, mental illness, and a whole lot of subsequent table-flipping, so I hope you can find an easier path.

You cant have a casual sexual relationship with someone you have feelings for. You can't have sex with someone who doesn't like you as a human being and be surprised it was just about sex for them. If you want to feel valued as a complete person, you need to put in the leg work and \"date\" some guys and find a good fit.\n\nI date completely normally. I find guys I really click with and am attracted to. I get to know them over the course of hanging out a few times. Sometimes I really have feelings and I tell them I like them. Sometimes I realize the connection is more shallow and tell them I don't want anything serious. I just always try to pay attention to what I want vs what I think I want. Sometimes I think I want sex and really I want someone to hold me and tell me they care about me. Sometimes I think I have feelings for a guy but in reality I just really like the sex and its clouding my judgement . \n\nI always keep a dude though. I always have that one fuck buddy who's just a stand up guy. A guy who is dependable (nothing worse than a booty call going unresponded to for hours). He's respectful. The sex is good. The conversation before and after the sex is good. And there's something that makes me not want to date him. He's my human dildo. I like the dick *and I also like the human it's attached to*. But I don't have feelings for him.\n\nBeing single is rough. Getting hurt sucks. Getting hurt is part of life. But it doesn't need to be part of your sex life. Figuring out why you're getting hurt and try out solutions. Figure out what works and what doesnt (and casual sex doesn't work for a lot of people. There's nothing wrong with needing emotional intimacy to be able to enjoy sexual intimacy. Its common and until *super* recently was the societal norm). Nobody here can give you advice because it's a compeltely unique introspective issue.", "id": "daosqo9"}, {"comment": "thank you.\n\n> You can't have sex with a dude you kind of like and never define anything and hope it works out.\n\nabsolutely. you're right. and i feel extra stupid. the thing is, with this current guy my coworker, i didn't kind of like him at first - i just saw him as physically attractive, and i really thought omg this is awesome someone i just find hot but don't really know on a deep level/actually like. then as we got to cuddling and the talking we had in our drinks before sex, over time, i began to see a vulnerable side to him and started liking him from there i guess, he's asked me out for meals but only when he's very drunk, makes me wonder where i stand with him and leaves me confused af. god, just typing that feels so pathetic. the more i think about it, the more i feel like i'm just not made for casual hook ups or fuck buddies. as people have pointed out, yes i get attached easily. \n\nhaha, wow i hate that.\n\neverything you said makes sense. but i have trouble understanding how fuck buddies actually work. i'm sorry if that makes me sound like a total noob to what sounds so self explanatory, but, well, i am. i mean, you say you have to like the person the penis is attached to, and get along with them (see, all that makes it sound like you could actually potentially end up liking them), but the key thing is that there has to be a deal breaker of some sort in them? that sounds good, but hard to find.\n\n> But I think the number one problem women have is they don't feel confident in asserting themselves and respecting their own desires. If you're sleeping with a guy and catch feels, tell him. If you want sex but get jealous easily, tell him. \n\nthis is what gets me most. it is pretty much where i am. you seem to be confident. you make it sound so easy. and actually yeah it probably is... i suppose the reason that people (men and women) don't assert what they want is because it's kind of like asking for something, and that leaves the door open for rejection, which people like to avoid. to be honest, i am scared to tell him i like him/get jealous easily because of rejection, knowing he probably doesn't feel the same way, or being made to feel stupid for feeling jealous, especially when you know he's a fuckboy.", "id": "dapwhxh"}], [{"comment": "Sounds like you the need the D, as in a dildo...  \n\n", "id": "daoej7v"}, {"comment": "i know. but penis is penis, you know?", "id": "dapx9g7"}], [{"comment": ">you really feel the difference between someone who wants you for you, and someone who wants you just for sex... but if you acknowledge it, that's how you can start making peace with it.\n\nThis is a really good place to start from. Separating sex from love is a whole lot of work and can be very painful, but realize that *you also* have the power to only want someone for sex. You don't owe your hookup partners any emotional investment; you're just using their company to satisfy your body's needs, same as they might be using yours. Coming to the place of, \"we did this because *I* wanted to; *I* am getting *my* needs met; it was *my* choice and *I* had fun,\" and moving away from \"he took advantage of me; I have no emotional worth to this person; I'm only useful as a sex object\" - that can be very empowering, and very peaceful. Take it from me, as a Scorpio-level horny butterface with one serious partner and a growing harem of FWBs (partner and I are poly and everyone knows about everything; it's all kosher) who also \"saved herself\" with the wrong man for way too long: taking agency over your own sex life and your own emotional well-being is AWESOME.\n\nI'm sorry I can't be more helpful with the \"how\" of this post, but I hope it helps you to know that it is possible to separate sex from the ideas of emotional attachment and self-valuation, and that there are women who grew up with the Disney-princess-Prince-Charming brainwashing who have done so. I got to this point via some drawn-out trauma, mental illness, and a whole lot of subsequent table-flipping, so I hope you can find an easier path.

I get angry with her.\n\nContinueing:\n\nOne week I don't hear from her for two days. I get a message in the evening saying something like \"You deserve better.\"\nTurns out she walked away from home again. I contacted her mother. Mother tells me she hooked up with the ex again (whilst dating me), she came to know, and her daughter walked away. (Mom strictly did not want her to talk to that guy). See the ex was hated by her mother too because he was trying to persuade her to leave her home I gues.. So the mother told me what happened and that they looked eachother up. ( I guess she didnt know we were dating so can't blame her, and I actually appriciate her telling me).\n\nBla bla bla. When I found out she was still on her ex's social media I got angry like I said and SHE ASSURED ME THAT SHE WOULD NOT TRADE ME FOR HIM.\n\nWell we see the outcome.\nShe (I am serious when I am saying this) seemed like the perfect girl, did not want any money, just love, the perfect woman to make my wife (she actually told her dad she wanted to marry me).\n\nTrust me man.

The new law being debated aims at criminalizing anti-choice websites misrepresenting facts and reality being used as propaganda material for such pressures.\n\nIn this context of \"fake news\" hysteria, I personally think it's a good thing. There is a difference between on one hand being \"pro-life\" and compassionately accompanying people facing the decision and making sure they'll be taken care of if they continue the pregnancy, and on the other hand being anti-choice and scaring people through falsehood to go to full term, whatever the cost."], [2, "It's the Commission des Affaires Sociales (Commission of the Social Affairs ... Yes! That was pretty straightforward :p) that is dealing with that. It's because if you google IVG (interruption volontaire de grossesse - pregnancy voluntary interruption), you'll find 10 times more bullshit than actual information among the first results. And it's unfortunately true that people rarely go further than the first page of results, making such misinformation very dangerous.\n\nA radio columnist on the main public radio, who has a daily post where he tackles many subjects in a satire and smart manner by interviewing people and highlighting contradictions or the enormity of their remarks, called a couple of month ago a \"hotline\" for information about IVG. And such \"services\" prey on the women (and men) in the situation where they wonder if and how they should follow the steps of an abortion. They multiply the false facts, statistics, false ideas. It made me think of the tactics I discorvered in a documentary that took place in the U.S. where a fake abortion clinic was just on the opposite side of the pavement of a real abortion clinic, and like a spider catches insects they were using awful tactics to shame women coming to get (information about) an abortion. Plus picketing.\n\nAnyway, apparently this 5 minutes radio column made it to the commission and fed the discussion.\n\nHowever, discussing such a matter is also an open window for anti-IVG (anti-abortion) people (elected) to try to heat the argument, slow the process with time-wasting and idiotic amendments. [When texts of a law are discussed, every elected representative can submit amendments about the text. It can be anything from the choice of a word, expression of the idea (to clarify), or the substance of the text (let's say changing the threshold where it's legal to have an abortion from X weeks to Y weeks because of reasons A, B, and C).

However, in France abortion isn't allowed past three weeks of pregnancy, when the foetus is just a mass of cells with no heartbeat, and is certainly not able to live outside the womb. If, for medical reasons, a woman has to abort past those 3 weeks, they'd either force the birth (with chemicals), or extract the foetus with a c-cut (not sure that's how it's called?).

I actually faked a period once like said I had it and asked for tampons just so she wouldn't take me to the doctor to ask why my cycle was so weird. \n  The other day after I had come home from hanging out with my boyfriend she asked if he had  \" put any moves on me \". I said no but we really  had just had sex .

There are obviously different ways of doing the procedure and from what it sounds like Planned Parenthood's instructions for mine were better.\n\nI was 8 weeks and a day along as well. I was/am in a committed relationship. We were living with his religious parents for a couple of months while we were looking for new, affordable housing. We had to sleep in separate rooms because we're not married while staying with his parents. You can imagine the bad timing for me to find out I'm pregnant. I call my medical provider (Kaiser) and they refer me to Planned Parenthood. \n\nI went in for my appointment anxious as hell (already have anxiety mental health problems), but for some reason I was beyond myself with anxiety while at PP. They wouldn't let my partner back with me. I had been using a Nuva Ring for birth control and I messed up by not cleaning it correctly or inserting it soon enough or something. They have to take a finger prick and and a blood draw for testing. Luckily for me, I already have issues with getting my blood taken. I nearly faint. The room is spinning and they have to bring me apple juice and an ice pack for my neck. \n\nLater they room me and they perform an ultrasound to confirm my pregnancy and how far along I am. She asks if I want to see it. I say no. I never felt attached to the fetus nor did I have much issue with emotion turmoil with having an abortion. It is/was one of the best decisions I have made for my future. I didn't want to try to imagine a small baby inside of me.\n\nThey gave me antibiotics to take and the first pill. They didn't indicate that the first pill would cause nausea. I went home and threw up and felt terribly nauseous all night. (My morning sickness had me nauseous normally round the clock too.)\n\nWe got a hotel for the next part. I had read online that being in a bath can help during the thick of it. The instructions for my 4 misoprostal tablets were to put them in my mouth, 2 in each cheek and wait 15 minutes for them to dissolve. I believe the rule was if you throw up before 30 minutes you have to go to the doctor to get more tablets. I was sitting on the hotel bed waiting with trash can in hand. On the dot, I threw up. Nausea and general unwell feeling came over me. My partner helped me to the bathroom and ran the bath for me. He brought me Gatorade to sip on while I try to relax in the warm bath. I cant recall how long I stayed in the tub. I began to bleed and pass small clots, eventually a slightly bigger one passed. It was somewhat unsettling to see, but never did I think to myself that it was the fetus. It didn't lol remotely like anything other than blood clumped up. The warm water helped a lot with the cramps that were more severe than any period cramps I've experienced.\n\nWhen I got out of the tub I still felt unwell and continued to bleed and cramp heavily. I had my partner bring me hot water bottle after hot water bottle to apply to my pelvic region. I stayed curled up in bed wearing thick pads for the rest of the day. My partner ordered us pizza and went to the nearby store for all the comfort foods. We watched movies and cuddled while I tried to endure the pain. I believe I taken a Norco or two during the process for the cramping. The bleeding and some pain continued all weekend (pills were taken Friday). It wasn't unmanageable or horrifying. I would consider trying a surgical abortion in the future instead because of the cramping and nausea, but the pain I suffered might not be the same for everyone. \n\nI never felt sad for a lost baby, but I do still think about how old he/she would've been if I hadn't done it. Then I remember all that I've accomplished without having to have an unplanned, unwanted child. I had known from the start of our relationship that I would have an abortion if I were to become pregnant. He was always supportive. \n\nI am glad I got to have my abortion be a private matter between myself and my partner. I didn't have to go through the hard parts with a nurse or doctor overwhelming me. I went back to PP a week later to confirm it worked. \n\nSorry for the rambling. Feel free to ask me anything. I'm actually a teen family planning health educator as well.

I was thinking of leaving him, but he would threaten me and I was just too scared. And I stuck with him, thinking something will change sometime. I was terrified of becoming pregnant and so had asked him to atleast wear a condom while having putting it in.\n\nAll he wanted was his pleasure and he did not spare much a thought for me. When I didn't have my periods on time I was terrified as it usually never happens to me. I confided in a friend of mine who was a waitress and she got me one of those pee sticks which told me that I was pregnant with my abusive boyfriends child.\n\nI was devastated and scared and just wanted to end it right there. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know if I should tell him, what he will think, whether I should tell my parents and so on.\n\nSo I mustered up the courage to tell him as at the end of the day it was his kid (I was not slept with anyone else) and I thought as the father of the kid he deserved to know. So when he came to see me after a week or so, I told him that I was sick and had been to the doctor's and the doc said I was pregnant. I was not expecting much support, just I wanted him to take the news in. He flipped out and called me a whore and threw stuff at me and said he regretted all the time he spent with such a lying whore. And he said he would not be responsible for the baby and he doesn't have any cash to give to lying whores. I was so heart broken I just wanted to die.\n\nA few days later, he turned up at my room with a weird expression. He apologized and said that he had been drinking and was totally unprepared for the news. He was real nice, hugged me and made me feel comfortable and then had sex with me many times. At night, I was ambivalent whether he wanted to keep the baby or he was just trying to console me. I really didn't want a baby with him. So just to get to know what was on his mind I said that maybe I had to look for a job if we were to raise a kid together. He just got up from bed and told me he was not going to help me raise a whore's kid and then went out. He had played nice just to get the sex.\n\nI was just devastated. Luckily my friend and her sis who was a nurse arranged for a medical abortion. Secretly I was hoping that something goes wrong and that I die. But the doctors were so nice and my friends were so nice. My friend's sis asked her boy friend to pose like my boy friend just so that noone would know my story.\n\nThe process was painless. I felt a scraping sensation inside, that is all. My mind hurt but my body didn't hurt. My 'BF' never came to visit, nor did he know what I had done.

I took no pills before hand, I went to planned parenthood in upstate New York, took a pregnancy test and the appointment was made for 3 days later. Typical office & waiting room, was counseled and brought back to the exam room. Internal was conducted, I was numbed from inside, music was playing on the radio, my friend held my hand and spoke to me over the nurse who was giving me a play by play of what the dr was doing. ( I didn't need to know) it was over in 10 minutes. Yes there was a vacuum, yes there was blood. When they were done, I was escorted into a room for about 45 min to get my bearings, have juice get dressed and go into another room for my first Depo shot.

They called in a prescription for the second batch and some anti-nausea medicine. \n\nAs I was waiting for my prescription, the bleeding started. I quickly bought some pads and ran to the toilets! If nothing else, I learned that the world won't end if I get my period unexpectedly in public!\n\nThen I went home, took the anti-nausea medicine, and held the four other pills in my cheeks until they dissolved. \n\nThis was about 5:30 pm. Everything was going smoothly and, aside from the early bleeding, according to plan. I felt fine!\n\nBy the time my boyfriend arrived at 10 pm, I was extremely dizzy and nauseous and the cramping was horrible... although probably not a bad as actual labor. I had passed several blood clots the size of fried eggs. \n\nI bled some more and finally passed out just after midnight. \n\nWas there sadness? Yes. Of course. I don't think it's a decision anyone makes lightly or on a whim. \n\nWas there discomfort? Sure. It's definitely not something I want to do again. \n\nBut it was safe enough to do in the privacy of my own home, surrounded by my kitties. And, while my insurance wouldn't cover it at my doctor's office, I was able to make an appointment at a conveniently located planned parenthood. \n\nWhat bothers me most is that this option is not readily available to all women in my country.

She was was pretty sure she could tell when the baby came out but in her case it was smaller than the end of her finger. \n\nShe had the cramping and vomited once, which she attributes to the pain medication that they gave us for her.

I had her hold off until she was ready, which could have been indefinitely if she wanted.\n\nShe said the one thing she wished that she had been better informed on was what the experience would be like.

I would love to share my emotional journey with my abortion in case it helps someone in the same situation. \n\nI found out I was pregnant about 2 weeks in, which is incredibly lucky. I was in a long distance relationship at the time. So when I found out I was pregnant I knew exactly when it happened. My boyfriend had just come to visit. Our condom broke one night, which we didn't realize until it was over. I had never taken Plan B before, but I had plenty of friends who had, all successfully. I wasn't worried at all. I took Plan B less than 8 hours after the broken condom and then forgot all about it. My period should have come the following week, but it didn't. I didn't truly think I was pregnant, but I decided I might as well take a pregnancy test so I didn't have to wonder about my late period anymore. I was completely shocked when it turned out positive. I went back to the drug store and bought three more tests, just in case. \nI was raised as a Catholic, and although I hadn't as identified that way for years, abortion was always a topic that I just would rather not have thought about. I didn't want to confront my deeply held feelings that women have the right to choose if/when they want to have children with a lifetime of authority figures telling me how wrong abortion was. Whenever a friend threw out the question \"What would you do if you got pregnant?\" I would always respond \"I don't know, probably adoption.\" \nHowever, the moment I saw two lines on my pregnancy test, I knew I was getting an abortion. It was never even a choice. I didn't agonize over it (as I know some women do), I just knew. I had just moved to a new city where I didn't know anyone, and started a new job. There was *no way* I was going to be pregnant or, much less, raise a child.  I was surprised at how certain I was. A feeling struck me: if there was a little soul growing inside of me that I was about to tear away from the world, wouldn't *I* be the one to know that? I felt absolutely 100% comfortable with my decision. No priest, or teacher, or even another woman had *any* idea what was going on with my body or spirit. After all, up until 5 minutes before, I, myself, thought I would chose adoption. That is a revalation that I am still grateful for to this day. \nI am fortunate to live in a large city with access abortion care. I called Planned Parenthood right away. They couldn't give me an appointment until the following week, but I wanted this to be done. So, I kept searching until I found another independant clinic nearby. (It can be challenging sorting through the riffraff \"Crisis Pregnancy Centers\" when you don't know what you're doing.) It was a Saturday, and I could come in on Monday. I told my boss I had a doctors appointment. I was new, so it took some questions for me to understand how to document my time (sick? personal? vacation?). I had the overwhelming urge just to tell everyone I met, my new coworkers, my potential new friends, that I was having an abortion. As sure as I felt that getting an abortion was the right decision, I still felt a huge amount of shame thinking about what others would think of me if they knew. Growing up, I had heard neighbors, family friends, even my mom discussing abortion like it was the worst possible thing a person could do. I love all of those people, and I felt guilt for keeping this from them. I think that the urge to tell everyone was trying to dispel that guilt and shame.  \nI went to the clinic Monday morning and there were protestors outside. They were holding signs and shouting as I walked in. The shame welled up inside me. They might as well have been my childhood friends' parents yelling at me. I could still hear the protestors yelling from inside the lobby. I tried not to listen to the words, but just the noise was a constant reminder of the judgement I would face from anyone I chose to tell. I started to feel despair. I didn't want to talk to any of the other (incredibly kind) women in the waiting room. I just wanted to get out of there. When I met with a physician she saw how uncomfortable I was and asked if I wanted to wait. That snapped me out of it. Hell no, I didn't want to wait. I took the initial pills. \nI went to work in the afternoon and again fought the urge to tell everyone. I awkwardly told my boss I would be out the entire following day for a doctors appointment. She was confused, but didn't pry. I don't remember feeling nauseous at all. Just anxious to get on with it. \nThe next day I went back for the second set of pills. The protesters were back, shouting at me as I walked in. I took the rest of the pills when I got home. Then I tried to nap. I woke to intense cramps, so intense that I actually yelled out loud in my empty apartment. They felt like period cramps, but much more intense. I thought about all the disclaimers with the pill, i.e.: 1 out of every 10 bajillion people die. At the worst of the cramps, I honestly thought I was going to be that one person. I called the clinic back and they reassured me over the phone. I wish I had better feedback about this, but the honest truth is that it sucked. The good news is that it didn't last more than an hour. I was dreading the next round of pills but the pain wasn't even close to as bad that time. By the evening I was fine. I had gone through more pads than on a typical heavy period day, but not a concerning amount. Unlike with the OP and some other commenters, there was no specific blood clot that I knew would have turned into a baby. Probably because the pregnancy was only two weeks along.\nCoincidently, my mom was coming to visit starting that evening. I drove to the airport and picked her up, like everything was fine. Physically, I was. But, I felt so guilty not being able to tell her honestly how my day was. \nIn the next few weeks and months I continued to struggle with shame and fear of what other would think of me if they found out I had an abortion. However, I never once felt regret. I know this was the best, kindest, and most moral decision. \nFour years later, I have almost completely squared my feelings away. The handful people in my life who I have confided in have been supportive and kind. But the biggest contributor is that I have really worked through where my feelings of shame came from. I recognize now that they come from fear of something I can't control, others perceptions of me.\nIn some ways, I am very grateful for this experience. It forced me think about something that made me uncomfortable. Before, when I swept abortion under the rug, I was dodging my responsibility as a human being and a citizen. I was letting abortion be someone else's problem. I didn't want to get my hands dirty. And by not getting my hands dirty I was contributing to a situation where many women, most of whom are much less privileged than me, face incredible institutional and social barriers to taking care of themselves in one of the most basic ways: deciding whether or not to have a child. I was **so** lucky. I found out I was pregnant very early on, I lived in an area that, at the time, allowed medical abortions, I lived near plenty of clinics, I had the resources to pay for the procedure, I could take off time from my job without sacrificing pay, I had transportation to get myself to and from multiple appointments at the last minute, and I had a network of loving friends and family, whether they I chose to tell them or not. Many women don't have all or even any of those luxuries. I now know it is my responsibility to look out for them. My abortion forced the realization on me that just because I might not have experienced a certain struggle, that doesn't mean it isn't real. You can't sweep other's concerns under the rug because you can't relate. \nMy final thought is this: When I told my boyfriend about the protestors outside the clinic, and how much vitriol they had, he said \"With all the hate those doctors and clinicians get, we need to give them that much more love.\""], [-12, "[removed]"], [2, "Thank you for sharing your experience.

I was/am in a committed relationship. We were living with his religious parents for a couple of months while we were looking for new, affordable housing.

They wouldn't let my partner back with me. I had been using a Nuva Ring for birth control and I messed up by not cleaning it correctly or inserting it soon enough or something. They have to take a finger prick and and a blood draw for testing. Luckily for me, I already have issues with getting my blood taken. I nearly faint. The room is spinning and they have to bring me apple juice and an ice pack for my neck. \n\nLater they room me and they perform an ultrasound to confirm my pregnancy and how far along I am.

They didn't indicate that the first pill would cause nausea. I went home and threw up and felt terribly nauseous all night. (My morning sickness had me nauseous normally round the clock too.)\n\nWe got a hotel for the next part. I had read online that being in a bath can help during the thick of it. The instructions for my 4 misoprostal tablets were to put them in my mouth, 2 in each cheek and wait 15 minutes for them to dissolve. I believe the rule was if you throw up before 30 minutes you have to go to the doctor to get more tablets. I was sitting on the hotel bed waiting with trash can in hand. On the dot, I threw up. Nausea and general unwell feeling came over me. My partner helped me to the bathroom and ran the bath for me. He brought me Gatorade to sip on while I try to relax in the warm bath. I cant recall how long I stayed in the tub. I began to bleed and pass small clots, eventually a slightly bigger one passed. It was somewhat unsettling to see, but never did I think to myself that it was the fetus. It didn't lol remotely like anything other than blood clumped up. The warm water helped a lot with the cramps that were more severe than any period cramps I've experienced.\n\nWhen I got out of the tub I still felt unwell and continued to bleed and cramp heavily. I had my partner bring me hot water bottle after hot water bottle to apply to my pelvic region. I stayed curled up in bed wearing thick pads for the rest of the day. My partner ordered us pizza and went to the nearby store for all the comfort foods. We watched movies and cuddled while I tried to endure the pain. I believe I taken a Norco or two during the process for the cramping. The bleeding and some pain continued all weekend (pills were taken Friday). It wasn't unmanageable or horrifying. I would consider trying a surgical abortion in the future instead because of the cramping and nausea, but the pain I suffered might not be the same for everyone. \n\nI never felt sad for a lost baby, but I do still think about how old he/she would've been if I hadn't done it.

I hope you're taking care of yourself. \n\nI also had a medical abortion last year. It was the best decision for me and a lot different than I expected. \n\nLike you, I had an appointment to verify the pregnancy, then a follow up for the first round of drugs. They called in a prescription for the second batch and some anti-nausea medicine. \n\nAs I was waiting for my prescription, the bleeding started. I quickly bought some pads and ran to the toilets! If nothing else, I learned that the world won't end if I get my period unexpectedly in public!\n\nThen I went home, took the anti-nausea medicine, and held the four other pills in my cheeks until they dissolved. \n\nThis was about 5:30 pm. Everything was going smoothly and, aside from the early bleeding, according to plan. I felt fine!\n\nBy the time my boyfriend arrived at 10 pm, I was extremely dizzy and nauseous and the cramping was horrible... although probably not a bad as actual labor. I had passed several blood clots the size of fried eggs. \n\nI bled some more and finally passed out just after midnight. \n\nWas there sadness? Yes. Of course. I don't think it's a decision anyone makes lightly or on a whim. \n\nWas there discomfort? Sure. It's definitely not something I want to do again. \n\nBut it was safe enough to do in the privacy of my own home, surrounded by my kitties. And, while my insurance wouldn't cover it at my doctor's office, I was able to make an appointment at a conveniently located planned parenthood. \n\nWhat bothers me most is that this option is not readily available to all women in my country.

She was was pretty sure she could tell when the baby came out but in her case it was smaller than the end of her finger. \n\nShe had the cramping and vomited once, which she attributes to the pain medication that they gave us for her. She inserted the suppositories herself, we didn't have to have nurse come visit. She also had some second thoughts prior to taking her medications. I had her hold off until she was ready, which could have been indefinitely if she wanted.\n\nShe said the one thing she wished that she had been better informed on was what the experience would be like. She too was prepared for a long and painful process. She said it was more like a period with extreme craps for several hours then the painful aspects went away. She ended up using ibuprofen to manage the pain.\n\nAs the non-carrier my role was to be home with her as she went through it and support her in any way I could which mostly meant bring her food and water if an when she wanted it, let her have the TV remote and keep the dogs away from her when she didn't feel well. \n\nI'm feel so grateful that we were able to have our abortion.

", "id": "dapg1ej"}], [{"comment": "Thank you so much for sharing. \n\nI had a medical abortion about 4 years ago. I would love to share my emotional journey with my abortion in case it helps someone in the same situation. \n\nI found out I was pregnant about 2 weeks in, which is incredibly lucky. I was in a long distance relationship at the time. So when I found out I was pregnant I knew exactly when it happened. My boyfriend had just come to visit. Our condom broke one night, which we didn't realize until it was over. I had never taken Plan B before, but I had plenty of friends who had, all successfully. I wasn't worried at all. I took Plan B less than 8 hours after the broken condom and then forgot all about it. My period should have come the following week, but it didn't. I didn't truly think I was pregnant, but I decided I might as well take a pregnancy test so I didn't have to wonder about my late period anymore. I was completely shocked when it turned out positive. I went back to the drug store and bought three more tests, just in case. \nI was raised as a Catholic, and although I hadn't as identified that way for years, abortion was always a topic that I just would rather not have thought about. I didn't want to confront my deeply held feelings that women have the right to choose if/when they want to have children with a lifetime of authority figures telling me how wrong abortion was. Whenever a friend threw out the question \"What would you do if you got pregnant?\" I would always respond \"I don't know, probably adoption.\" \nHowever, the moment I saw two lines on my pregnancy test, I knew I was getting an abortion. It was never even a choice. I didn't agonize over it (as I know some women do), I just knew. I had just moved to a new city where I didn't know anyone, and started a new job. There was *no way* I was going to be pregnant or, much less, raise a child.  I was surprised at how certain I was. A feeling struck me: if there was a little soul growing inside of me that I was about to tear away from the world, wouldn't *I* be the one to know that? I felt absolutely 100% comfortable with my decision. No priest, or teacher, or even another woman had *any* idea what was going on with my body or spirit. After all, up until 5 minutes before, I, myself, thought I would chose adoption. That is a revalation that I am still grateful for to this day. \nI am fortunate to live in a large city with access abortion care. I called Planned Parenthood right away. They couldn't give me an appointment until the following week, but I wanted this to be done. So, I kept searching until I found another independant clinic nearby. (It can be challenging sorting through the riffraff \"Crisis Pregnancy Centers\" when you don't know what you're doing.) It was a Saturday, and I could come in on Monday. I told my boss I had a doctors appointment. I was new, so it took some questions for me to understand how to document my time (sick? personal? vacation?). I had the overwhelming urge just to tell everyone I met, my new coworkers, my potential new friends, that I was having an abortion. As sure as I felt that getting an abortion was the right decision, I still felt a huge amount of shame thinking about what others would think of me if they knew. Growing up, I had heard neighbors, family friends, even my mom discussing abortion like it was the worst possible thing a person could do. I love all of those people, and I felt guilt for keeping this from them. I think that the urge to tell everyone was trying to dispel that guilt and shame.  \nI went to the clinic Monday morning and there were protestors outside. They were holding signs and shouting as I walked in. The shame welled up inside me. They might as well have been my childhood friends' parents yelling at me. I could still hear the protestors yelling from inside the lobby. I tried not to listen to the words, but just the noise was a constant reminder of the judgement I would face from anyone I chose to tell. I started to feel despair. I didn't want to talk to any of the other (incredibly kind) women in the waiting room. I just wanted to get out of there. When I met with a physician she saw how uncomfortable I was and asked if I wanted to wait. That snapped me out of it. Hell no, I didn't want to wait. I took the initial pills. \nI went to work in the afternoon and again fought the urge to tell everyone. I awkwardly told my boss I would be out the entire following day for a doctors appointment. She was confused, but didn't pry. I don't remember feeling nauseous at all. Just anxious to get on with it. \nThe next day I went back for the second set of pills. The protesters were back, shouting at me as I walked in. I took the rest of the pills when I got home. Then I tried to nap. I woke to intense cramps, so intense that I actually yelled out loud in my empty apartment. They felt like period cramps, but much more intense. I thought about all the disclaimers with the pill, i.e.: 1 out of every 10 bajillion people die. At the worst of the cramps, I honestly thought I was going to be that one person. I called the clinic back and they reassured me over the phone. I wish I had better feedback about this, but the honest truth is that it sucked. The good news is that it didn't last more than an hour. I was dreading the next round of pills but the pain wasn't even close to as bad that time. By the evening I was fine. I had gone through more pads than on a typical heavy period day, but not a concerning amount. Unlike with the OP and some other commenters, there was no specific blood clot that I knew would have turned into a baby. Probably because the pregnancy was only two weeks along.\nCoincidently, my mom was coming to visit starting that evening. I drove to the airport and picked her up, like everything was fine. Physically, I was. But, I felt so guilty not being able to tell her honestly how my day was. \nIn the next few weeks and months I continued to struggle with shame and fear of what other would think of me if they found out I had an abortion. However, I never once felt regret. I know this was the best, kindest, and most moral decision. \nFour years later, I have almost completely squared my feelings away. The handful people in my life who I have confided in have been supportive and kind. But the biggest contributor is that I have really worked through where my feelings of shame came from. I recognize now that they come from fear of something I can't control, others perceptions of me.\nIn some ways, I am very grateful for this experience. It forced me think about something that made me uncomfortable. Before, when I swept abortion under the rug, I was dodging my responsibility as a human being and a citizen. I was letting abortion be someone else's problem. I didn't want to get my hands dirty. And by not getting my hands dirty I was contributing to a situation where many women, most of whom are much less privileged than me, face incredible institutional and social barriers to taking care of themselves in one of the most basic ways: deciding whether or not to have a child. I was **so** lucky. I found out I was pregnant very early on, I lived in an area that, at the time, allowed medical abortions, I lived near plenty of clinics, I had the resources to pay for the procedure, I could take off time from my job without sacrificing pay, I had transportation to get myself to and from multiple appointments at the last minute, and I had a network of loving friends and family, whether they I chose to tell them or not. Many women don't have all or even any of those luxuries. I now know it is my responsibility to look out for them. My abortion forced the realization on me that just because I might not have experienced a certain struggle, that doesn't mean it isn't real. You can't sweep other's concerns under the rug because you can't relate. \nMy final thought is this: When I told my boyfriend about the protestors outside the clinic, and how much vitriol they had, he said \"With all the hate those doctors and clinicians get, we need to give them that much more love.\"", "id": "daq7ubp"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "dap8wdn"}, {"comment": "This comment was removed:\n\n[Comments like this are not welcome if the OP has had, or has decided to have an abortion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/faq#wiki_i.27m_prolife.2C_everyone_else_here_appears_to_be_prochoice.2C_am_i_allowed_to_post_here.3F) \n\n\n\n---\n\n[2X FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/faq) | [2X Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/rules) | [2X Moderation Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/wiki/moderationpolicy) | [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette) | [reddit's rules](/rules)", "id": "dap98vo"}], [{"comment": "Thank you for sharing your experience.

Probably these weapons were made especially for women, with their\ncomparatively small hands.\" Which do provide compelling counters for the idea that these are just ritual items.\nThere was \"military tattoos on the remnants of the skin of both the men and women.\" and while I didn't see any mention of the women in these graves sustaining battle injuries, there have been other cases of Eurasian female graves from this time period with fatal battle wounds caused by weapons.\n\nWhile I do think the evidence is there to show that the Sythians and their descendants in Eurasia probably did have some warrior women in their ranks of horse archers, it seems to be that it wasn't really the norm - (75% of the female graves in this large excavation had solely domestic related artefacts, and the female graves with weapons also had many of these same domestic artefacts, indicating that the majority of women were domestic.)\nDavis-Kimball herself notes that the majority of graves with domestic luxury goods suggested that the \"most frequently found status among females is that of femininity and the hearth.\" So I'd be inclined to take her word for it.\n\nIt could be related to their nomadic lifestyle.

They're caused by men who've spent centuries (or longer) treating anything assigned to women as being intrinsically less important.\n\nI get cranky when men cry about not getting custody of their kids, then blame feminists instead of centuries of men dominating the political and legal system that assigns custody.\n\nAs much as we all love the term \"egalitarianism\", it's just fiddling with what topics get to be gender neutral, while ignoring the fact that one gender is still considered inferior."], [6, "I think we just proved that feminism has a long way to go (bigly.)

If you look at feminism as more than simply \"technical legal equality,\" feminism's work is not completely done in the US. From pushing back against anti-abortion legislation, to expanding both parental leave and access to childcare, to addressing negative societal attitudes toward women, there is still a lot to fight for. There are a lot of areas where implementation and culture haven't caught up to the law--for example, the way some law enforcement handles cases of domestic abuse, sexual violence, or trafficking. (And these are issues that impact men, as well!) Looking forward, I think a lot of our battles will involve issues like this, where women are technically equal under the law, but still have needs that aren't sufficiently addressed, or areas where societal views of gender are holding *everyone* back.\n\n2. Holy crap, the rest of the world. If you look outside of high-income countries (and even within some--I'm looking at you, Japan), outdated views of women and their place in society still reign. Women in Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, India, China, and too many other countries to list still desperately need feminism. That isn't to say that they need \"white/western feminism,\" but they need women-focused advocacy, with support from both within and without. I've worked with feminist/women's empowerment organizations around the world, and they would all laugh at the idea that feminism's work is \"done\" globally. Personally, I think that western feminists have a duty to keep fighting for more in our own countries, while doing everything we can to support our counterparts in countries that have much further to go (and actually listening to them, something this sub isn't always good at).\n\n\nFor your essay, you might also look into issues of intersectionality (particularly with race, gender identity, and class) and how feminism in the US needs to pay more heed to the needs of women of color, trans women, and poor women. I consider myself a feminist (and I am white, and well-off), but I'm willing to recognize that mainstream media-focused western feminism has failed a whole lot of women by focusing on the desires and needs of well-off white women. For the record, I see less of this in the policy sphere. I think that feminists who are actually involved in policy have done an admirable job of addressing the needs of marginalized women (improving healthcare access for low-income women, working for justice for tribal women, supporting female activists abroad, etc.), but these aren't the causes that get the most attention from celebrity or internet feminists.

There are a lot of areas where implementation and culture haven't caught up to the law--for example, the way some law enforcement handles cases of domestic abuse, sexual violence, or trafficking. (And these are issues that impact men, as well!) Looking forward, I think a lot of our battles will involve issues like this, where women are technically equal under the law, but still have needs that aren't sufficiently addressed, or areas where societal views of gender are holding *everyone* back.\n\n2. Holy crap, the rest of the world. If you look outside of high-income countries (and even within some--I'm looking at you, Japan), outdated views of women and their place in society still reign.

That isn't to say that they need \"white/western feminism,\" but they need women-focused advocacy, with support from both within and without. I've worked with feminist/women's empowerment organizations around the world, and they would all laugh at the idea that feminism's work is \"done\" globally.

I think that feminists who are actually involved in policy have done an admirable job of addressing the needs of marginalized women (improving healthcare access for low-income women, working for justice for tribal women, supporting female activists abroad, etc.), but these aren't the causes that get the most attention from celebrity or internet feminists.

For example, women are subject to far more online harassment than men, and many negative stereotypes of women prevail in all forms of media. Feminism's job in first-world countries is to point these things out and say, \"Hey, that's not cool.\" Obviously, feminism in many other countries has far bigger fish to fry. ", "id": "daqoeq6"}, {"comment": "> for example women are subject to far more online harassment\n\nThis is largely because women's online presence in general is valued more than men's. The average woman will have a significantly higher following than the average man online. Because of this, women are also far more likely to receive praise and support online than men. I could counter argue that men are largely ignored online and fail to receive the type of support and praise women do. Women can simply block online harassment, men cannot create online support.\n\n> many negative stereotypes of women prevail in all forms of media.\n\nLike what? The only stereotypes I see in media regarding women are positive. Even among fat women, people are actually encouraging women to be fat with the whole \"everyone is beautiful\" thing instead of encouraging them to lose weight which would actually be beneficial to them. Other than maybe media regarding strippers, I can't think of any type of modern day media that stereotypes women negatively.", "id": "daqsax7"}], [{"comment": "Yeah the women are the strong gender now.

I would hope one would be more concerned about why you gained such a significant amount of weight in such a short time, health wise.  My wife gained around 30lbs and kept it on over the last year due to a pregnancy, unfortunately we lost our daughter 4 days before  her scheduled due date.  Regardless, i haven't changed my views of her body but she sure has and that is the only turn off I have  with her, is the way she sometimes beats herself up over her weight which is normal time to time and I understand that, but not her actual weight.  \n\nPorn is a lve hate relationship, most wont admit it but it changes expectations in the bedroom by sensationalizing everything.  If it's porn that actually keeping him away from  you then he needs to figure out a way to separate the two worlds, reality vs fantasy, if he can't then it will hurt your intimacy with each other not to mention you sanity as you've mentioned.  \n\nI would begin by doing what you have done, try to make yourself apart of it.  If you catch him join in( im hoping this can be understood without saying), nine times out of ten he won't mind.  I would however say that if he isn't embarrassed by it, and this is my stance then there's something lost there, some sort of detachment that needs to be addressed.  Understand as well that this may have nothing to do with you, and may have something to do with his psyche, something he may be going through, a matter of inadequacy, form of ED, performance anxiety, something, anything that he is noticing about himself that you aren't to no fault of your own, so an open dialog and support is always necessary when approaching this subject and a level of comfort that both of you know that you'll both have each others support no matter the issue.    It also could be that you've grown more sensitive to the situation haven having to revisit your self esteem.  We tend to notice things a lot more when it pertains to how it makes us feel or how it is affecting our daily life, there's a chance that he might have been doing this more or less all along but now with your lack of confidence it's rearing it's head  and starting you in the face.  Mountain our of a mole hill.  I want to say that these are just my experiences and I have no knowledge of your relationship so take them with a grain of salt if I sound preachy, i do apologize.  \n\nI would encourage talking about it, letting him know what you've noticed and how it's affecting you internally, but allow him to speak his peace freely without persecution if an answer is truly what you want.  If after exploring the conversation as to why it's happening there isn't a behavioral change over time in either of you or both I would say it might be time to explore other options if the two of you aren't happy.  Keep in mind that there are other forms of intimacy and sex isn't the on'y way a couple can connect on that level.  \n\nLastly, as a mentioned above ( and I say this without knowing the dynamics or cause of your weight gain)  a healthier you will go a long way for yourself, regardless of how he feels.  I've been on both sides of the fence and have struggled with it my entire life and living a healthier cleaner lifestyle definitely exorcised a lot of my inner demons.

I would hope one would be more concerned about why you gained such a significant amount of weight in such a short time, health wise.  My wife gained around 30lbs and kept it on over the last year due to a pregnancy, unfortunately we lost our daughter 4 days before  her scheduled due date.  Regardless, i haven't changed my views of her body but she sure has and that is the only turn off I have  with her, is the way she sometimes beats herself up over her weight which is normal time to time and I understand that, but not her actual weight.  \n\nPorn is a lve hate relationship, most wont admit it but it changes expectations in the bedroom by sensationalizing everything.  If it's porn that actually keeping him away from  you then he needs to figure out a way to separate the two worlds, reality vs fantasy, if he can't then it will hurt your intimacy with each other not to mention you sanity as you've mentioned.  \n\nI would begin by doing what you have done, try to make yourself apart of it.  If you catch him join in( im hoping this can be understood without saying), nine times out of ten he won't mind.  I would however say that if he isn't embarrassed by it, and this is my stance then there's something lost there, some sort of detachment that needs to be addressed.  Understand as well that this may have nothing to do with you, and may have something to do with his psyche, something he may be going through, a matter of inadequacy, form of ED, performance anxiety, something, anything that he is noticing about himself that you aren't to no fault of your own, so an open dialog and support is always necessary when approaching this subject and a level of comfort that both of you know that you'll both have each others support no matter the issue.    It also could be that you've grown more sensitive to the situation haven having to revisit your self esteem.  We tend to notice things a lot more when it pertains to how it makes us feel or how it is affecting our daily life, there's a chance that he might have been doing this more or less all along but now with your lack of confidence it's rearing it's head  and starting you in the face.  Mountain our of a mole hill.  I want to say that these are just my experiences and I have no knowledge of your relationship so take them with a grain of salt if I sound preachy, i do apologize.  \n\nI would encourage talking about it, letting him know what you've noticed and how it's affecting you internally, but allow him to speak his peace freely without persecution if an answer is truly what you want.  If after exploring the conversation as to why it's happening there isn't a behavioral change over time in either of you or both I would say it might be time to explore other options if the two of you aren't happy.  Keep in mind that there are other forms of intimacy and sex isn't the on'y way a couple can connect on that level.  \n\nLastly, as a mentioned above ( and I say this without knowing the dynamics or cause of your weight gain)  a healthier you will go a long way for yourself, regardless of how he feels.  I've been on both sides of the fence and have struggled with it my entire life and living a healthier cleaner lifestyle definitely exorcised a lot of my inner demons.  I hope you can figure your situation out and the two of you find happiness.   ", "id": "daqcx76"}, {"comment": "Thank you for this honest response. And I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your daughter. I really do agree with everything you've said - to be honest, when I've \"caught him,\" he will typically get embarrassed and stop what he's doing. I never really thought of using that as an opportunity to create some sexual intimacy. I will definitely try that. And more recently, I have been encouraging him to include me/tell me when he's masturbating so I can be a part of it. I have to be honest though - in the past when I have caught him, it has really hurt me and upset me because I've wondered why he didn't want to include me/prefer the real, live girlfriend, sitting in the next room, but instead chose to use an image/video on a computer screen to do things himself. And I know he's masturbated over our relationship but it may very well be much more in my face now, causing me distress when he's masturbating and we're not having sex at all, even after I try to initiate. Like your wife, I am very hard on myself and critical of my body; I'm not confident about my body and hide it every chance I get. With that said, I have tried to initiate things recently, in the hope that it could help this situation, without success. And you're dead on about the exercise - I have been a yo-yo dieter/exerciser for most of my life so I know how good I can feel when I'm in a routine where I'm working out, eating good and taking extremely good care of myself.

Thanks so much.", "id": "daqg42f"}, {"comment": "Total bullshit IMO.\n\nI'm a guy who's married and most of my friends are either married or in long relationships.  Weight absolutely has everything to do with sexual attraction, ESPECIALLY when you've been together for a long time.  The bottom line is that it takes active participation and attention to detail to stay attractive to your partner as time goes on.  A huge part of \"doing your part\" in a relationship is to stay healthy and in shape for your mate.  To expect someone to stay sexually attracted to you when you let yourself get fat is pretty unrealistic.  \n\nMy wife tends to yo-yo with getting overweight.  I'm not going to lie to you, it absolutely 100% affects my sex drive towards her.  I bust my ass in the gym 5-6 days a week and go running a lot to stay in top shape.  I expect the same from her and when she starts to go downhill, I usually just tell her candidly and openly.  She usually gets upset, cries, then starts back on her diet and exercise program.  This has happened probably 4-5 times now (about every other year) over the years and she always gets back on the program, loses the weight and does great.  \n\nThe problem is honestly complacency.  People get comfortable with the status quo and let themselves go.  It's why we are so disgusting as a nation.  You should always be seeking to improve yourself through education and physical fitness.  If you get too comfortable and lazy, you will get fat and the result will be a decline in your relationship, your physical well-being and general life quality.\n\nI wish you luck and hopefully you will lose the weight and the relationship will improve.  As a guy who has done this many times, I can pretty much guarantee your weight gain is the cause of the issue, and it will be resolved when you get back in shape.  Use it as a reminder that fitness and relationships are a constant journey and require a lot of effort and attention to detail to maintain.

Maybe get a meal kit like blue apron so you can cook healthy food together or do a big meal prep of healthy food on your days off to eat throughout the week.

I wanted to share a little bit about my own little boy. \n\nMy son is 18 months now and since 4 months we have been going to a bunch of specialists to try to find out the source of his weakness. It started with low tone in his trunk. I noticed he could not do the \"mini push up\" milestone. We started PT and he could not handle it. He started having explosive and exhausting vomiting the day after every PT session. A GI prescribed an anti reflux medication because he was aspirating small amounts of fluid basically all the time. It's like his belly couldn't control the muscles enough to keep liquids down. \n\nNeurologist said there was asymmetrical weakness and it seemed to come and go. For about 6 months he had a weird head tilt. Sometimes his legs would have very high tone and it was almost impossible to get them to bend. Eventually he had an MRI which only found he has mild chiari but no other abnormalities. He had a genetic microarray test done and it found nothing. He has a mild heart murmur that probably is nothing but I always wonder if it's related. He has always been very undersized despite eating a ton of very nutritious food. I made my own baby food and, with the assistance of his doctors, \"beefed it up\" with extra good fats, proteins, and vitamin rich foods. \n\nHe was not able to sit up until about 10 months. He started taking first steps at 16 months but did not seem to make much headway with improving walking skills. I noticed one of his legs was moving awkwardly. After a few more doctors looked at it, they determined he needed braces. They said it seems like his legs are super loose and flexible (before they were having the random stiffness) and one may be longer than the other. So that's where we are now. He just got his first \"moon boots\" and after a few days was able to walk pretty well with them. If he has on baggy pants, most people probably wouldn't look twice. He is now running and pivoting and rarely falls. \n\nWe are waiting on a whole exome DNA test. It's a long wait (about 16 weeks). I try not to think about the wait though. \n\nEven though it sucks big time, I am glad your family was able to get a diagnosis.

I would be happy to copy some of the article to a private message if you're interested.  This could get a bit long because it's still not entirely clear how this all works and I'm wordy.\n\nHSV-1 encephalitis affects people of all ages, including kids and teenagers. About 1/3 of patients, mostly the pediatric ones, develop encephalitis as a primary infection that invades nerves and travels along them up to the brain.  The nerves thought to be involved are the trigeminal or the olfactory tract. The trigeminal nerve, also known as the fifth cranial nerve, is responsible for sensation on the face, biting, and chewing. The olfactory tract is responsible for sense of smell.  Another proposed mechanism of infection is HSV viremia - the virus gets into a person's blood after they were infected at any site, and travels to the brain through blood vessels.\n\nAn estimated 50% or more of the US population has been infected with HSV-1, and many people don't know they have it. It's passed by oral secretions, including saliva or possibly droplets, and by contact with infected skin.  In a few fairly well known cases, infants developed HSV-1 encephalitis following traditional Jewish ritual circumcision involving oral suction of blood from the circumcision wound (a practice only done in certain Jewish groups).  People can shed the virus without having a current cold sore or other outbreak, including people who have never noticed symptoms.\n\nLike you said, HSV-1 encephalitis is a very rare condition, especially in infants. It's not a reason to avoid kissing your kids unless you currently have a sore, and there are probably better reasons to avoid kissing young infants on the mouth (their immune systems take time to develop, and they are only protected by mom's antibodies from certain things and for a short period). I'm very sorry that your son and family have to deal with this - how rare something is doesn't really matter when it affects you.

Unless someone has specifically asked for an antibody test there's no other way to know if you have it. A woman with genital hsv is usually prescribed antivirals to prevent transfer during labor.

I realize we are discussing this on a thread where something extremely rare DID happen, but living life in a zero risk way is not really feasible.

I wanted to share a little bit about my own little boy. \n\nMy son is 18 months now and since 4 months we have been going to a bunch of specialists to try to find out the source of his weakness. It started with low tone in his trunk. I noticed he could not do the \"mini push up\" milestone. We started PT and he could not handle it. He started having explosive and exhausting vomiting the day after every PT session. A GI prescribed an anti reflux medication because he was aspirating small amounts of fluid basically all the time. It's like his belly couldn't control the muscles enough to keep liquids down. \n\nNeurologist said there was asymmetrical weakness and it seemed to come and go. For about 6 months he had a weird head tilt. Sometimes his legs would have very high tone and it was almost impossible to get them to bend. Eventually he had an MRI which only found he has mild chiari but no other abnormalities. He had a genetic microarray test done and it found nothing. He has a mild heart murmur that probably is nothing but I always wonder if it's related. He has always been very undersized despite eating a ton of very nutritious food. I made my own baby food and, with the assistance of his doctors, \"beefed it up\" with extra good fats, proteins, and vitamin rich foods. \n\nHe was not able to sit up until about 10 months. He started taking first steps at 16 months but did not seem to make much headway with improving walking skills. I noticed one of his legs was moving awkwardly. After a few more doctors looked at it, they determined he needed braces. They said it seems like his legs are super loose and flexible (before they were having the random stiffness) and one may be longer than the other. So that's where we are now. He just got his first \"moon boots\" and after a few days was able to walk pretty well with them. If he has on baggy pants, most people probably wouldn't look twice. He is now running and pivoting and rarely falls. \n\nWe are waiting on a whole exome DNA test. It's a long wait (about 16 weeks). I try not to think about the wait though. \n\nEven though it sucks big time, I am glad your family was able to get a diagnosis.

He and I both are learning sign language because he can not speak very well. His motor pathways developed incorrectly or not at all. When other people's babies were cooing and babbling, my baby was quiet or would just smile or giggle or cry. Other people's babies were sitting up and starting to make speech sounds and mine fought tummy time, couldn't pick up his head, and continued being quiet. Still later, their children were starting to talk, while mine was just learning how to stand. Every child develops at a different pace and while at times may be frustrating for you, just realize that your child is unique and irreplaceable, and you may actually have a very different and probably more close relationship with them because of the special needs. My son is now 2.5 years old and has said maybe four words, none of which were mama. He's in therapy and we work on language and ASL. He absolutely loves it and his world is opening up for him because now he can communicate. So much so that he now makes up his own signs if he doesn't know a sign for something.

She couldn't see anything I posted. All in all the only part she knew about me was that we went to conventions together, but in reality that didn't mean much. \n\nI'm going to say this. \n\n1) Chronic suicidal depression and dealing with PTSD does not make you any less of a person. In relationships there is this thing called PATIENCE, and whatever happened in your last relationship was not because you fucked up due to your mental health situation, but rather that the other person did not educate themselves, consider everything, and practiced patience. \n\n2) This is not all in your head. There is something utterly wrong and you are feeling it. From your response to Diwarock I can see that you are being gaslighted. I've been in this situation, please get out. Just because you are mentally instable does not mean that you are not smart/aware. \n\n3) Memories are malleable, my ex used to tell me I did things I didn't do when I was emotionally breaking down. He even had the nerve to call me abusive even though I never hit him. The worst I ever did was grab his wrist when he was walking away to get him to look at me and have a very important conversation  about 'us' that he seemed to avoid repeatedly. He told me things were all in my head, and later post break-up people who know both of us opened up to me about what he said about me. We were on a trip together and he told these people I was his stalker, and we once dated... we were dating at the time and I paid for the entire trip. \n\n4) He still has feelings for his bestfriend, she knows what she is doing, and she 100% is trying to get him back. I am a female best friend, and I make sure my friend's girlfriend never feels threatened by me. I do simple things that make her aware that I am not wishing to surpass my friendzone with him. This includes that moment when the best friend stole your limelight... I would have been the one who would have received the hug and then brought him over to you and let him know it was all your idea, or thank you for doing all of this. Then leaving him with you to go mingle myself. \n\nYou are worth so much more than how you are being treated right now. I would calmly express my feelings and give the examples you just spoke of in your original post. If he gets angry at you even when you are calm and seems to want to dismiss everything, leave him. You don't need him. \n\nMy best advice is only get into relationships where you WANT the other person, and never when you NEED them.

Now, sometimes this leads to nothing, but in your case it's going to lead down a heartbroken road. \n\nThe information that you had provided suggests that she is trying to get back with him. She is deliberately getting in between you and him. And it's clear that he still harbors quite a lot of feelings for her, which is understandable. We all still have feelings, no matter how little, with at least one of our ex's. But, in your case, he is acting on those feelings with her. In normal situations we avoid physical interactions with our ex's, especially when we are in another relationship. He clearly is taking advantage of your quiet, un-confrontational nature. He has betrayed you. This is not how normal relationships work.\n\nI'm going to be brutally honest with you. It's gonna hurt. Believe me when I say that I know exactly how you feel as I have been suicidal and deal with depression from an also shitty childhood, I was molested at age 5 by multiple people (including family).

They are completely healthy and rational.\n\nI know you might not want to. I know you will continue to love him. But, this is a major violation. He knows what he is doing and so does she.

He called her at 05:00 to tell her that he's been having increasing doubts and that he wasn't going through with it. The best man goes to meet him quietly in a pub somewhere and he's a little scatterbrained but feels like he's doing the right thing. Said that he'd had doubts beforehand but that he thought it was just normal pre-wedding stuff and that it'd go away - it didn't dawn on him that he wasn't actually happy until that morning. Her family are scary East-Londoners and bouncing off the walls trying to find the guy to quite literally beat him senseless so the best man is pulling a real balancing-act.\n\n\nThe bride's obviously gutted but heads to the reception venue and calls everyone in to have a \"party\" as the caterers are all paid. We're sat along the bar with the best man whilst the bride is putting on a brave face but obviously not having a great day. Everyone leaves as soon as is polite to do so. Worst part was the bar started playing love songs about half an hour in as nobody had told them. Cue the retrospectively quite ridiculous image of half a dozen guys diving back to the bar as quickly as possible whilst trying to look incognito as possible to try and get the bar to change the music back to \"mindless pop\".\n\n\nIt's now six years later. The \"groom\" has literally fallen off the face of the earth. Quit his job that day, closed all his social media accounts and severed all ties. I understand he got all his stuff from his flat and disappeared within a day or two as her family was quite scary and vocal that they were after him. The bride on the other hand moved back to live near her family and has met an absolute legend. They're very happy together and she used it as impetus to progress with what she really wanted to do, become a teacher. She graduated this year and they own a place together.\n\n\nIn fairness, rather than actually getting married (in both her and your case), it's probably better that he called it off beforehand than went through with it, lest you'd either have to unpick a marriage too and had a challenging six week wedding.\n\n\nI feel for you!

I know it's not easy, but it can be done. Believe me, if I did it, you can do it. I have been in a similar situation.  Meet my father. His parenting style is forbidding anything and everything. We were expected to stay home and not make noise. When he found out about my first boyfriend at 19, he went NUTS. He blamed my mom for allowing me to get \"out of control.\" It was humiliating. (Especially since my mom did a wonderful job raising us. She was extremely supportive. Thanks to her, my sister and I went to universities, she became a lawyer, I became a college instructor. That's being out of control? Poor father... so disappointed. All his efforts of forbidding gone to waste.) Anyway, that experience taught me never to introduce anyone to my father. Fast forward some years...I met someone. It got serious. He introduced me to his family. I introduced him  to my sister,  mother, friends. For five years my father had no idea of his existence. Then, 4 months ago, my boyfriend proposed. I was wearing his ring, discussing wedding plans with his family... and my father still didn't know. Eventually, his family started wondering why. Was I ashamed of my fianc\u00e9? What was going on? So... fueled by peer pressure, I finally decided to tell my father. . . Over the phone. HE WENT NUTS (surprise). He immediately told me to stop that nonsense and \"forget about it.\" That I was too young and didn't know what was good for me (I'm 32). he made me feel small. It was very upsetting.... disrespectful.. And kind of ridiculous .. it took my mom and sister a month of coaxing to finally convince him to meet my fianc\u00e9. And now the first meeting's out of the way!! (Woohoo!!)  He's getting used to the idea even if he's not entirely happy about it. But that's ok. He's not the one who is going to live my life.

We were expected to stay home and not make noise. When he found out about my first boyfriend at 19, he went NUTS. He blamed my mom for allowing me to get \"out of control.\" It was humiliating. (Especially since my mom did a wonderful job raising us. She was extremely supportive. Thanks to her, my sister and I went to universities, she became a lawyer, I became a college instructor. That's being out of control? Poor father... so disappointed. All his efforts of forbidding gone to waste.) Anyway, that experience taught me never to introduce anyone to my father. Fast forward some years...I met someone. It got serious. He introduced me to his family. I introduced him  to my sister,  mother, friends. For five years my father had no idea of his existence. Then, 4 months ago, my boyfriend proposed. I was wearing his ring, discussing wedding plans with his family... and my father still didn't know. Eventually, his family started wondering why. Was I ashamed of my fianc\u00e9? What was going on? So... fueled by peer pressure, I finally decided to tell my father. . . Over the phone. HE WENT NUTS (surprise). He immediately told me to stop that nonsense and \"forget about it.\" That I was too young and didn't know what was good for me (I'm 32). he made me feel small. It was very upsetting.... disrespectful.. And kind of ridiculous .. it took my mom and sister a month of coaxing to finally convince him to meet my fianc\u00e9. And now the first meeting's out of the way!! (Woohoo!!)  He's getting used to the idea even if he's not entirely happy about it. But that's ok. He's not the one who is going to live my life.

We went to the pharmacy that moment to check-- positive pregnancy test.\n\nI went to my OBGYN to confirm. The nurse there talked us through our three options:\n\n1. Abortion\n2. Adoption\n3. Raise a baby\n\nThe nurse was very clear: Any decision I made, it would be a decision I would live with for the rest of my life.  It was MY decision.  But part of MY decision was including my boyfriend in the decision-making process.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I started having sex three years prior, I told him I could probably never get an abortion unless there was a risk to my or the fetus' health. But the hypothetical was now reality, and we were seriously discussing abortion.\n\nHe made a lot of very valid, logical points.  We were seniors in college, no jobs, living with his family, no savings, and he wasn't emotionally ready to have a kid. I scheduled my appointments at Planned Parenthood (I'm in PA where you have to do a consultation/see a video and then wait minimum 24 hours before scheduling your abortion).\n\nI was never comfortable with abortion.  I considered it so that I wasn't basically saying \"Fuck you\" to my boyfriend.  He drove me to that first appointment, and I knew I didn't want to do it. I left the appointment a crying mess.  My boyfriend told me we would continue with the pregnancy and work it out.\n\nWe talked some more over the next couple weeks, and he couldn't handle adoption.  I DEFINITELY could not handle adoption, knowing I had a kid out there (even an open adoption would be impossible for me to handle).\n\nOnly other option was to raise a baby. We agreed that's what we would do, we would make it work.\n\nThat all being said.... my ex became withdrawn from me. Emotionally neglectful and abusive.  In his defense, he was probably overcome with stress, but I deserved better than that.  I became emotionally abusive in response (I can take blame where I deserve it). My pregnancy was stressful and hard because I had no emotional support from him.  I was horribly depressed, anxious with panic attacks, and at times even suicidal. I ended up moving out after my kid's 1st birthday because my ex began throwing/breaking things around the house due to his inability to manage his anger and stress.\n\nMy kid is 5 now. His dad was barely involved (his own choice) and only paid child support up until 6 months ago.  He's decided he wants some involvement (one hour, once a week, also his choice). I have spent the last 4 years begging him to be more involved, but he's just not willing or able.\n\nI love my son. He's amazing. Most of the time I know I made the right choice for ME. But there are times that I feel guilty and ashamed that I ruined my ex's life and I put this responsibility on him that he didn't want. But I knew I couldn't handle adoption and abortion would have led me down a very dark road that I couldn't return from.\n\nI'm pro-choice and I made a choice to follow-through with my pregnancy.  I give you the advice that was given to me, with a bit more information: You have three choices, all of which come with lifelong consequences. Everybody in your life will be impacted by these choices in some way, but your only obligation is to make sure that you're making the right choice for YOU (and if you decide to go through with the pregnancy, for the baby). If you do decide to have the baby, this man will have the opportunity to be a permanent figure in your life and the baby's-- keep that in mind (from the child of an abusive father).\n\nI wish I could give you the love and support I lacked and desperately needed when I was pregnant and confused."], [1, "Do whatever you think is best for yourself.

We went to the pharmacy that moment to check-- positive pregnancy test.\n\nI went to my OBGYN to confirm. The nurse there talked us through our three options:\n\n1. Abortion\n2. Adoption\n3. Raise a baby\n\nThe nurse was very clear: Any decision I made, it would be a decision I would live with for the rest of my life.  It was MY decision.  But part of MY decision was including my boyfriend in the decision-making process.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I started having sex three years prior, I told him I could probably never get an abortion unless there was a risk to my or the fetus' health. But the hypothetical was now reality, and we were seriously discussing abortion.\n\nHe made a lot of very valid, logical points.  We were seniors in college, no jobs, living with his family, no savings, and he wasn't emotionally ready to have a kid. I scheduled my appointments at Planned Parenthood (I'm in PA where you have to do a consultation/see a video and then wait minimum 24 hours before scheduling your abortion).\n\nI was never comfortable with abortion.  I considered it so that I wasn't basically saying \"Fuck you\" to my boyfriend.  He drove me to that first appointment, and I knew I didn't want to do it. I left the appointment a crying mess.  My boyfriend told me we would continue with the pregnancy and work it out.\n\nWe talked some more over the next couple weeks, and he couldn't handle adoption.  I DEFINITELY could not handle adoption, knowing I had a kid out there (even an open adoption would be impossible for me to handle).\n\nOnly other option was to raise a baby. We agreed that's what we would do, we would make it work.\n\nThat all being said.... my ex became withdrawn from me. Emotionally neglectful and abusive.  In his defense, he was probably overcome with stress, but I deserved better than that.  I became emotionally abusive in response (I can take blame where I deserve it). My pregnancy was stressful and hard because I had no emotional support from him.  I was horribly depressed, anxious with panic attacks, and at times even suicidal. I ended up moving out after my kid's 1st birthday because my ex began throwing/breaking things around the house due to his inability to manage his anger and stress.\n\nMy kid is 5 now. His dad was barely involved (his own choice) and only paid child support up until 6 months ago.  He's decided he wants some involvement (one hour, once a week, also his choice). I have spent the last 4 years begging him to be more involved, but he's just not willing or able.\n\nI love my son. He's amazing. Most of the time I know I made the right choice for ME. But there are times that I feel guilty and ashamed that I ruined my ex's life and I put this responsibility on him that he didn't want. But I knew I couldn't handle adoption and abortion would have led me down a very dark road that I couldn't return from.\n\nI'm pro-choice and I made a choice to follow-through with my pregnancy.  I give you the advice that was given to me, with a bit more information: You have three choices, all of which come with lifelong consequences. Everybody in your life will be impacted by these choices in some way, but your only obligation is to make sure that you're making the right choice for YOU (and if you decide to go through with the pregnancy, for the baby). If you do decide to have the baby, this man will have the opportunity to be a permanent figure in your life and the baby's-- keep that in mind (from the child of an abusive father).\n\nI wish I could give you the love and support I lacked and desperately needed when I was pregnant and confused.", "id": "dar6hxm"}], [{"comment": "Do whatever you think is best for yourself.

The campus, including professors and other students, would likely know if there was an evacuation for some reason other than a temporary fire alarm. If you want to make comparisons to the \"real world\", then at a real job if you were evacuated from you house/apartment it would be reasonable to take the day off the next day and not show up to work unprepared and in pajamas. I don't think I've had a boss that would ever object to that.

Has he changed behavior much for the better for you to feel more confident or do you still feel like he may be up to no good since you are checking his phone? Remember, names in phones can be changed, text/calls can be deleted. Even though you are checking his information there could still be infidelity happening I am so sorry to say and I really hope that it is not. The worst feeling is to have the sense of constant uncertainty and no one wants to feel crazy. It is very hard to release and let go of that fact that he did what he did. Very disturbing that it was with a friend. I would be wary of introducing him to new people even for the fear. \n\nI once stayed with my ex after I found out that he was cheating. Very similar, he was newly addicted to pain medications. He slipped away from me. We were so happy and like glue together. Pretty soon he hid his drug use and I found talking to him was like talking to a blank wall. Limited emotion and interest. He started using my computer late at night and Skyping girls he met online. Pretty soon after I found out that he was inviting them over while I was at work and seeing them in the middle of the night to pay for BJ's. Disgusting, but I loved him. He left our home an emotional wreck, trying to run away from me down the street crying and couldn't look at me. Shortly later after separating, we got back together based off of our love and history. A feeling came to me in the middle of waking up one morning and I checked the online dating site he had used before.. low and behold he had made a new account (after deleting the old) and had been active on his account within 3 hours, so he was again talking to people in the middle of the night. My heart sank. \n\nI would always trust your intuition and gut feelings. Honor what your body is telling you.

It seems by you still checking his personal belongings that you are anticipating the next cheating act. If that is the way he makes you feel, try to think about what leaving him would entail. It is so difficult to comprehend leaving someone you have been with for so long, I know. Short story, my friend from school was in a 12 year marriage with her HS sweetheart. She found out that he was a \"sex addict\" or thats what the counselors called it. He left her for another woman and my friend was left heartbroken. She was forced to pick her life up alone.

He should be understanding for your worries and stress that he created in the first place, and willing to make or help them go away. He should have no problem showing you his phone on his own if he is faithful, but know if he leaves it out while in the shower he knows that you are able to get at it.

I remember when my husband and I first started dating, things moved really quickly to the point that we ended up getting married 5 months after we met. I'd say about a month after we got married I was snooping around on his tablet while he was at work (something I normally don't do) and found tons of messages between him and different girls he knew through Facebook, most of them he knew personally. Most of the messages were sexual, nudes photos, and invitations from him to come over his house (a lot of the times right after I had left his house). I did however notice that after those invitations came rejections from the girls... \n\nI confronted him that same night about the messages, I felt sick to my stomach knowing that I had jumped into marrying someone that had been so deceitful to me! I had even called his mother and told her what had happened, she was livid and called him immediately after hanging up with me. I will never forget how unwanted and unattractive I felt that night, actually I felt like that for a long time afterwards, it took me months to let him touch me the way he used to... I did eventually put all that in the back of my mind and started focusing on the present. Do I still think about it from time to time? Yes. But I don't let it consume me. \n\nIt's normal to have the feelings you have, whether it be 5 years later or 25 years later. Maybe see a therapist privately? It could help.

You will relive the pain in flashbacks that come from some unseen trigger. \nThis is no way to live your life. You deserve someone who you can trust fully and let your guard down. Don't worry about being seen as strong or weak. No one else has to live your life but you. \nI leave you with these questions - when this pain comes back on you and you are hurting - will he be the one to say all the right things and comfort you, make you feel safe again, apologize for the 1000th time?

We'd been together about 10 years, married for a little over one when he told me he'd been having an affair for about a year. So, almost the whole time we'd actually been married. It was crushing, confusing and hard at first but honestly, it lead to a stronger, happier relationship for both of us. It was like cancer. You're never happy you had cancer, but sometimes you can find good things in it, you learn things about yourself and your loved ones you wouldn't otherwise, about the strength of your relationships of yourself. We learned exactly how much we love each other and how much our vows really meant to us. Basically the key for me was learning that trust *isn't* earned, it's given.  There wasn't anything he could do to prove he was never going to mess up again, I had to choose to trust him and he had to choose to be there. Hah, sorry I can tell I'm rambling. You're not alone.

Your husband never did that.  He had an emotional affair with you, a physical affair with you, cheated on you with his best friend's girlfriend.. yeah.. this isn't a guy who chose to stop - he stopped because he got caught - if he stopped and *if* everything got caught. Because he didn't come to you, you don't have a solid base to start on for you trusting him.\n\nJust because you decided to stay then, it doesn't mean you can't change your mind now.  If he wants to rebuild your trust, he shouldn't be keeping secrets. You should have free access to his phone right now.  He should be bending over backwards to show that he has changed.  If he has been open, honest, and working hard to restore your trust in him, it does take 2-5 years to start to feel better.  If you don't have free access to information, and he hasn't been working his ass off, you don't have a way to prove to yourself that he is trustworthy, so you really can't start healing.\n\nNot Just Friends is a book that I would really recommend for you both to read.  Check it out!", "id": "dapyu7y"}], [{"comment": "Oh what distress, I am so sorry to hear that you are going through such a hard time. Cheating can definitely leave the partner feeling major trust issues. That is great you went to counseling. Although, if a man wants to have sex with other women he is going to do it whether he is married or not, if that is what he wants. Has he changed behavior much for the better for you to feel more confident or do you still feel like he may be up to no good since you are checking his phone? Remember, names in phones can be changed, text/calls can be deleted. Even though you are checking his information there could still be infidelity happening I am so sorry to say and I really hope that it is not. The worst feeling is to have the sense of constant uncertainty and no one wants to feel crazy. It is very hard to release and let go of that fact that he did what he did. Very disturbing that it was with a friend. I would be wary of introducing him to new people even for the fear. \n\nI once stayed with my ex after I found out that he was cheating. Very similar, he was newly addicted to pain medications. He slipped away from me. We were so happy and like glue together. Pretty soon he hid his drug use and I found talking to him was like talking to a blank wall. Limited emotion and interest. He started using my computer late at night and Skyping girls he met online. Pretty soon after I found out that he was inviting them over while I was at work and seeing them in the middle of the night to pay for BJ's. Disgusting, but I loved him. He left our home an emotional wreck, trying to run away from me down the street crying and couldn't look at me. Shortly later after separating, we got back together based off of our love and history. A feeling came to me in the middle of waking up one morning and I checked the online dating site he had used before.. low and behold he had made a new account (after deleting the old) and had been active on his account within 3 hours, so he was again talking to people in the middle of the night. My heart sank. \n\nI would always trust your intuition and gut feelings. Honor what your body is telling you. We are powerful beings.. think of when people lie they have tell tale signs, or if you meet someone and you feel uncomfortable around them... there is probably a reason. Now, with time you will always find the truth, it always comes out. It is just a matter of how much time you want to spend with him. It seems by you still checking his personal belongings that you are anticipating the next cheating act. If that is the way he makes you feel, try to think about what leaving him would entail. It is so difficult to comprehend leaving someone you have been with for so long, I know. Short story, my friend from school was in a 12 year marriage with her HS sweetheart. She found out that he was a \"sex addict\" or thats what the counselors called it. He left her for another woman and my friend was left heartbroken. She was forced to pick her life up alone. She wanted to stay and make it work, she would have done anything. After a few months of grieving, she has slowly picked herself back up again. She wish that she noticed or acknowledged the signs, of him staying out or not coming home/staying at a \"friends\".\n\nYou are a strong individual for staying, not weak.
