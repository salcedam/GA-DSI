He pointed out that her passport had no ~~expiration date~~ approval stamp (EDIT: sorry took me a while to remember exactly what was missing.  I said expiration date just to fill in the blank) so it was obviously forged.\n\nHonestly, the professional side of me should have ended it there.  I could have pulled him aside and detained them all there but it was nearing the final hour or so of the shift and I just wanted to go home.  Something like this could keep me on for another 5 hours.  That's on top of a 14 hour guard shift.  \n\nI tell the seaman, look I'm going to let you guys off easy.  This is not a real passport, she can't come on.  I should report her to Japanese police but I won't.   Just drop her off where she came from and we'll just let it go from there.  He U-turned around and left the north gate.  \n\nBut I had a funny feeling if he was on board this far he might be committed.  So I inform East gate of the vehicle description (east gate being the only other main gate open at the time and day).  Lo' and behold he tried it.  They pull him aside to vehicle inspection lot and they call me over. My shift for post was over and I was now roving (vehicle patrol).  I get there in minutes.  I come out of my unit and that's when they knew they were fucked.  \n\nSeaman dipshit starts bawling in tears and so does mama-san.  We cuff them both.  We pop their trunk and what's inside?  2 under age girls.  No ID or anything but they didn't look no older than 16.  It was one of the few times I ever drew my weapon during my time in the Navy.  \n\nSo what was going on?  Seaman shithead got the taste of pussy for the first time.  It's just that the girl he was \"dating\" was using him.  She was in business with a local brothel and convinced him to try something for the business. It turns out their plan was to smuggle a couple of girls in the barracks who would rotate their place in several different rooms which would allow for easy access for people within the barracks who might have liberty restrictions and are sequestered from within the base.  \n\nCID took the case from me.  Which makes sense.  I only had to put in my written statement and that was that.  I only stayed 30 min to an hour after which wasn't so bad.  I did get a follow up.  There was a big command investigation to figure out who else was in it and if there was anyone else hiding.  They couldn't find anyone else in the command.  I'm sure there was a few people in on it but no concrete evidence to really slam them.  There were no other girls found in the barracks either.  So we probably stopped this before it even began.  Months later I did get word from CID that Japanese police used this incident to crack down on that brothel and they found a slew of girls here illegally which was enough to close it down.  So in my own little way, I did my part to combat human trafficking just by doing my job only half right.\n\nIt was a good day actually.  My command put me up for a Navy Achievement Medal for that time which I got delivered to me after I left the Navy (that incident was about a half year before my time was up which probably also explains my senior-itis and not wanting to do my job despite knowing how to do it).

The problem is that they are citizens of \"banned countries\".  For instance they might belong to China.  Some times it's not matter of nation but age.  \n\nCame across an incident where a seaman tried to bring aboard a mama-san who was 45+ years old.  She had a Thailand passport as ID.  I thought to myself, what is this kid (who looked not even 20) doing with a middle aged woman.  I asked my JSG to have a second look (JSG are native citizen guards who can arm up and everything).  He pointed out that her passport had no ~~expiration date~~ approval stamp (EDIT: sorry took me a while to remember exactly what was missing.  I said expiration date just to fill in the blank) so it was obviously forged.\n\nHonestly, the professional side of me should have ended it there.  I could have pulled him aside and detained them all there but it was nearing the final hour or so of the shift and I just wanted to go home.  Something like this could keep me on for another 5 hours.  That's on top of a 14 hour guard shift.  \n\nI tell the seaman, look I'm going to let you guys off easy.  This is not a real passport, she can't come on.  I should report her to Japanese police but I won't.   Just drop her off where she came from and we'll just let it go from there.  He U-turned around and left the north gate.  \n\nBut I had a funny feeling if he was on board this far he might be committed.  So I inform East gate of the vehicle description (east gate being the only other main gate open at the time and day).  Lo' and behold he tried it.  They pull him aside to vehicle inspection lot and they call me over. My shift for post was over and I was now roving (vehicle patrol).  I get there in minutes.  I come out of my unit and that's when they knew they were fucked.  \n\nSeaman dipshit starts bawling in tears and so does mama-san.  We cuff them both.  We pop their trunk and what's inside?  2 under age girls.  No ID or anything but they didn't look no older than 16.  It was one of the few times I ever drew my weapon during my time in the Navy.  \n\nSo what was going on?  Seaman shithead got the taste of pussy for the first time.  It's just that the girl he was \"dating\" was using him.  She was in business with a local brothel and convinced him to try something for the business. It turns out their plan was to smuggle a couple of girls in the barracks who would rotate their place in several different rooms which would allow for easy access for people within the barracks who might have liberty restrictions and are sequestered from within the base.  \n\nCID took the case from me.  Which makes sense.  I only had to put in my written statement and that was that.  I only stayed 30 min to an hour after which wasn't so bad.  I did get a follow up.  There was a big command investigation to figure out who else was in it and if there was anyone else hiding.  They couldn't find anyone else in the command.  I'm sure there was a few people in on it but no concrete evidence to really slam them.  There were no other girls found in the barracks either.  So we probably stopped this before it even began.  Months later I did get word from CID that Japanese police used this incident to crack down on that brothel and they found a slew of girls here illegally which was enough to close it down.  So in my own little way, I did my part to combat human trafficking just by doing my job only half right.\n\nIt was a good day actually.  My command put me up for a Navy Achievement Medal for that time which I got delivered to me after I left the Navy (that incident was about a half year before my time was up which probably also explains my senior-itis and not wanting to do my job despite knowing how to do it).

The breakdown of certain types of bacteria, called gram-negative bacteria, so-named because they do not take Gram's stain in laboratory identification, also results in the release of pyrogenic endotoxins from the bacterial cell wall.\n\n>**Sweating that follows fever reduction means that the tissues at the site of infection are healing. That is, if the fever is infectious in origin, the causative organisms are decreasing in number or function, i.e., they are dying off.**\n\n>**As a result, there is a decrease in the number of white blood cells and other pyrogenic  chemicals at the site of infection.**\n\n>**This in turn signals the  the hyothalamus to reduce the body's set-point (point at which the body stops trying to warm itself up) to normal.**\n\n>**This causes the body's cooling system to kick in, because while your body's set-point  is back to normal, your body temperature is still higher than normal.**\n\n>Sweating is part of the cooling system which helps rid the body of excess heat by the process of evaporation and conduction, returning the body temperature to normal.\n\n>If you take aspirin or another fever-reducing agent, this will artifically lower your body's temperature by inhibition of prostaglandin.  There is good evidence to suggest that you shouldn't take one of these agents except for comfort as needed since higher temperatures are thought to be an unfavorable living environment to pathogens (disease-causing organisms).\n\n>[Source](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-a-good-thing-when-you-break-a-sweat-during-a-fever)", "id": "dagxvhh"}, {"comment": "yep. i had a fever that just wouldn't go away for several days. i had heard about breaking a fever, so i thought i might as well try it since nothing else had really worked. so i put on 2 hoodies, sweatpants, and 2 or 3 pairs of socks and crawled under 2 thick blankets. an hour later, i started to sweat a lot and instantly felt much better.", "id": "dah0z0z"}], [{"comment": "He should get checked out especially if this isn't a regular occurrence.

As an RA it is my job to check the rooms as students leave to make sure they are knowledgeable of any damages they might have to pay for. If they leave without \"checking out,\" then we perform the room checks at the end of finals week after everyone has left. \n\nI had one student leave without checking out. He lived in a double by himself after starting in the fall with a friend from high school who moved out halfway through the year. I figured the other roommate had left after joining a frat or something and thought nothing of it, but after seeing this kid's room I wouldn't doubt his living standards are what drove his roommate out. \n\nWhen I opened the door to the room, a literal wave of body odor hit me.

In the corner of the room, by the window, is a pretty sizable pile of what appears to be every article of clothing this guy owned. I'm guessing he hadn't washed the clothes all year because of the smell, and I'm also guessing he must have worked out in them, wadded them up, and thrown them in the pile by the window to bake in the sun because of how humid the room felt. \n\nAcross the entire room was scattered trash. Tipped over cans of soda, empty canisters of chewing tobacco, leaking bottles of chew+spit creating puddles on the floor.

I have no idea why he ripped them up, but they stuck to the floor because of all of the liquids leaking out. \n\nAnd right by his desk was the worst. A half foot high pile of chewed up sunflower seeds, spat directly on the floor. I gagged and immediately left the room. The stench on its own was fine.

In fact, he is respected for being a great leader with unparalleled oratory skills and we thank him for weakening the British in WW2, which was partly responsible for the Independence of India. We don't read much in detail about the holocaust in history... its mentioned as a pretty bad thing, but the same chapter also talks about America dropping atomic bombs on an almost defeated Japan. We realise that bad things happen during wars, and then we move on.\n\nIn Indian schools, a strict and effective teacher is often referred as a Hitler (\"Oh man... she's a Hitler... we better get to class on time\").\n\nAlso, Indians are inured to the idea of 'eradication' of a particular group of people - its comparably less horrific to us. Indians have often seen massive hatred waves based on race / caste / religion... Hindus and Muslims have been at each other's throats for centuries.\n\nDuring the partition of India, many Hindus in India wanted to kill all the Muslims, and there were Muslims in Pakistan who wanted to kill all the Hindus. More than a million people were killed at that time.\n\nCaste based riots have seen entire villages being murdered. Also, there have been massive religion based riots in which people kill off entire villages / towns.\n\nI believe Americans of old might be inured to such violence in a similar way too ... they almost eradicated the Native Americans. I bet those would not be shocked to learn that some guy called Hitler tried to kill off some large group of people and almost succeeded.\n\nSo when we learn that Hitler wanted to kill the jews, its not very shocking to us. To us, it seems like, oh maybe he had some reason to hate them... just like we hate our opposite groups. In fact, we know that's the way things are usually done all around the world. Just look at all the fighting going on around the world between groups who hate each other - Arabs against Israel, Radical Muslims against everyone else, etc. We are sometimes surprised that Hitler's actions are all that shocking to the westerners. Maybe the westerners have forgotten their own history due to a long period of peace.\n\nI believe its also a side effect of the violence that Indians have seen over the years, which makes them inured to Hitler's atrocities.\n\nFor example... in the US, the Rodney King incident was considered a horrific incidence of police brutality. In India, that kind of police beatings happen all the time. Its so common that it is expected that a citizen would get beaten mercilessly for displaying any behaviour that is even slightly deviating from complete compliance.\n", "id": "danbgss"}, {"comment": "Now I want to open a Hitler Hibachi.", "id": "damv2bd"}, {"comment": "Still though, this just makes me think about a hairy mustache touching my ice cream, I don't see how it's an effective advertisement.

I'm not Japanese but I'm living in Tokyo for the last 8 years. Don't take this wrong, but I believe you might be suffering from sampling bias, given that, from what you said, everyone you quoted has been living in a (presumably) English-speaking country for most (or all) of their life - it would be weird if they weren't good at it.\n\nWhile almost everyone here *studies* English (or is supposed to, at least), pretty much the only ones that are actually any good at it are people who have spent time overseas, or have gaijin friends. In the research lab where I work (which is very mixed, and English is the official language), we get a lot of graduate students, many from Todai; half of them have problems stringing together a sentence when they first come to the lab, and even the fluent ones still sound stereotypically Japanese. Even the professors, who have interacted with their academic peers all their lives, still can't pronounce English R. And \"normal\" people... I had people look scared when I enter the shop, saying \"what do we do\" to each other, then breathe a huge sigh of relief and crack even huger smile when I order in Japanese, just because they would not be able to take my order otherwise - we're not even talking about pronunciation here, but being incapable of basic interaction in their field of work, for which 100 words would have sufficed. So much for \"standard thing to learn\", I guess.\n\nI'm not saying the Japanese are incapable of learning how to pronounce English - this is not a racial issue - it's just that they don't have sufficient exposure, and especially not at critical age, to form those phonological patterns, and the English education is a disaster. (You can't teach a foreign language to a 40-person class once a week in native language, depending almost entirely on reading and writing and completely ignoring oral and any kind of interactivity, and recording pronunciation in a script that is entirely incapable of representing it - and expect it to stick. If people were writing down /w\u025dld/ instead of \u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 in schools, and watched anglophone movies without dubbing, things might be different, and if large swaths of English weren't effectively swallowed into Japanese... Who knows.)\n\nAlso, note \"typically\". There are always exceptional people. And I guess I'm lucky - I'm neither an English native, nor a Japanese native, but I can pronounce both rather well. That linguistics degree was less useless than I thought. :)\n\nP.S. Anecdotal evidence is anecdotal, but once I spent a full hour trying to get a coworker to recognise \"play\" vs \"pray\", or pronounce as different (either would have been a win).

I used my dad's experience as an example; \n\nMy dad was riding his Norton Commando to work one awfully foggy morning in 1978, I believe they lived in Santa Cruz. My dad said he'd purposely ride the shoulder, hearing the bumps, he knew he wasn't close to the center line. The head lamp ran off a generator, the low output was perfect for fog, brighter the lights the harder it is to see. It's a wall of white clouds. Last thing my dad remembered was a pair of headlights cresting, heading straight for the canyon wall coming across his lane... black.... CHP deduced the elderly lady driving a 1974 Oldsmobile Delta 88 accidentally put the hibeams on, it was a floor button operated with your left foot, which had broke; stuck on. The crest slightly curved to the right. She went straight, literally folding my dad into a square with a vicious head on accident. The foot pegs broke both shins, handle bars broke both femurs; what saved his life was he went mouth first into the middle of the handle bar/fork bracket. It instantly shattered all his teeth, and caught his jaw as it flipped over, breaking that as well. Had the bike not flipped,  miraculously hooking his jaw, and basically rolled him over the hood in a square/yoga poss, he would of torpedoed directly thru the windshield. The accident caused him to develop grand mal seizures, 6 rods with hardware in his legs. The story does end a little funny. \n\nAbout 3 months into his double hip to toe casts, facing more operations, with 3-4 months to go in his casts, a grave mistake happened. For two weeks straight he worked on a model Millennium Falcon, complete with this mini rubber band powered impellers. In theory it would raise up then shoot off straight, having timed all the rubber bands correctly. (It was balsa wood) Well the time comes, off course it goes up sideways, shoots off at an angle, boom! He launched it off the couch, and watched it kamikaze down the hall. My father, pissed, unable to walk, he crawled to the garage for a hacksaw to remove the casts! (He purposely did the model launch from a little remodeled area opposite of the kitchen where my mom was). As he's cutting he works moving his toes, raised each knee a couple inches, making sure he's healed. Because god damn it he wants that model, and those are coming off! He finishes, laying on the couch he take the casts off, one more test before he walks. Moves both legs fine! All pumped he jumps up off the couch, takes about 4 steps with complete weight bearing. BLOOP. Both surgically repaired femurs fold back over, there's my dad laying in the hall on his back, with both legs folded up, ripping apart the hardware that was screwed into his femurs. I guess the other funny part he calls for my mom, all sweet and nice. My mom yells \"you totalled your god damn han solo jet ship didn't you!?\" My dad quietly says \"yes honey I did, please come get it.\" My mom comes around the corner huffin and puffin, pissed off!

We were rolling out of Union Station running late, so we were serving dinner.  Going not more than 10 mph on a curve, we suddenly did an emergency stop, leaving me standing at about a 45 degree angle as I continued to serve my stunned passengers.  My immediate assumption was that some kid had pulled the emergency brake as a prank, but we soon learned we had hit someone lying on the tracks (\"trespasser on Amtrak property\" the report later said).  The guy was taken away in an ambulance with some gruesome injuries including multiple traumatic amputations.\n\nThe engineer was a nice guy we all knew and he was, obviously, first on the scene.  Immediately suspended (with pay, thankfully) for the investigation and forced to give a urine sample for drug testing - standard policy.  We felt terrible for him, going through all that, probably while he literally had blood on his hands.\n\nIt wasn't until that evening during our traditional late night bull session in the dinning car that I realized just how angry we all were.  As we cursed the stranger who had either passed out drunk or botched a suicide, one of the waitresses surprised us by chiming in \"I'm glad he didn't die.  The coroner would have put us eight more hours off schedule than the ambulance did.\"\n\nToday I understand that suicide is a sign of sickness and that even pure stupidity like seen in the video above should not be punished with death (and that's without accounting for passengers in that truck), but at that moment thirty years ago?  Yeah.  I agreed with her - that guy on the tracks had nothing but my contempt and we only cared about him surviving because his death would have been more inconvenient.\n\nI guess there's no moral here.

I was departing Sacramento westbound towards Davis and a woman was walking about 6 dogs all unleashed along the tracks. I didn't have sight on them until I rounded a bend and there they all were about a quarter mile ahead. Plenty of room and time to get clear from the tracks but I don't think she had very good control of those dogs. \n\nShe kinda had em all on one side about 20 feet off on the right of way but one was on the other side, she kept calling for it urging it to come across the tracks but at some point I felt like let it stay there we're getting too close. She just kept on and then at the worst time possible the dog decides to follow her command. Through the seat of my pants I could feel a slight bump as we rolled over the poor little guy. I looked back in the side view mirror and saw her fall to her knees in tears. I couldn't go back, I couldn't do anything but feel horrible. \n\n\"What kind of things are appropriate to throttle up for?\" All things that you would want to move through as fast as possible rather than attempt to stop and only end up sitting in the worst of it. The main thing that comes to mind are the fuel tankers, any kind of hazmat type tanker would be bad news. Fire on the right of way, ties, bridge etc. \n\nBasically you learn exactly how fast you can stop a train, then you learn that every train is different. You learn the physics of the rail car types. Some wheels are larger, some smaller. Brake shoes react differently for each. Loaded, empty, all huge factors. Loaded grain trains are up to around 16,000 tons, you can't stop those quickly. Empty container trains will squat right down with a good set of air in it. \n\nAfter running a lot of trains varying in makeup you just kinda get a feel of how much dynamic and air braking it'll take to get it to a full stop. If you're faced with a situation where you're going to hit something you have to determine if you can stop short. You factor in the grade you're on,undulations and such. The mile or so of track behind you that your train is still draped over, how your train will react to the actions you're about to make. \n\nBasically you have to think of all these physics in a flash and make a decision immediately, can I stop short of this or not? If the answer is no, you have to decide if the place you'll stop will be a danger to your crew or others near the tracks. If you're gonna blast through a fuel tanker and there's no way you're stopping short, you make that decision at once. You pull the throttle back to notch 8 and try to demolish the thing and knock it off the tracks hopefully. \n\n", "id": "dandqr7"}, {"comment": "Or any passengers.

Yet we find it hard to measure the magnitude of that eagerness and power. In this article we examine some of the problems involved in quantitatively measuring how the courts\u2019 role in America compares to other nations. We suggest that the notoriety of the U.S. does not result from the way citizens and judges handle routine disputes, which (different as it may be in developing countries) is not very different from in other wealthy, democratic societies. Instead, American notoriety results from the peculiarly dysfunctional way judges handle disputes in discrete legal areas such as class actions and punitive damages.\n\n...\n\n>Coffee spills, Pokemon class actions, tobacco settlements. American courts have made a name for themselves as a wild lottery and a money machine for a lucky few lawyers. At least in part, however, the reputation is unfounded. American courts seem to handle routine contract and tort disputes as well as their peers in other wealthy democracies. More generally, Americans do not file an unusually high number of lawsuits. They do not employ large numbers of judges or lawyers. They do not pay more than people in comparable countries to enforce contracts. And they do not pay unusually high prices for insurance against routine torts. Instead, American courts have made the bad name for themselves by mishandling a few peculiar categories of law suits. In this article, we use securities class actions and mass torts to illustrate the phenomenon, but anyone who reads a newspaper could suggest alternatives. The implications for reform are straightforward: focus not on the litigation as a whole; focus on the specifically mishandled types of suits.

Response time for problems was measured in never.\n\nLandlord rented me a room in a retirement home (no retirees. just mid 20s stoners). Surprisingly well maintained, but very illegal. Top floor contained a internal greenhouse and plaster busts of male torsos attached to the walls.\n\nLandlord fitted a boiler for a 1 bed flat in a massive 3 bedroom 150 year old house. Had to kick in the chimney breast in winter to get enough warmth to heat a single room. After leaving, house advertised with 'Cosy wood fire!'. Landlord attempts to take deposit for structural changes, told to fuck right off.\n\nRented a tiny flat below sea level. Floods on the regular, usually around high tide. 'You are drying clothes indoors, your problem'. Bedroom was a slot excavated under the road, that had to be boarded up after a visit from environmental health. No reduction in rent. Landlord decided that it was fine to store drain rods in my flat from his plumber. Stopped after I left them outside at risk of theft. Then rented the rest of the building to violent criminals. Left shortly after with police escort.\n\nLandlord rented room in house that included his stoned out of his gourd foul smelling 14 year old son. Was expected to babysit him and keep him out of trouble while the landlord lived in a house 20 miles away. Nope Nope Nope.\n\nLandlord attempted to rent me room with drug paraphernalia on all surfaces visible from outside the house. Didn't even enter house, was berated for wasting his time.\n\nSaw house to rent with no heating, and 8 residents in 4 rooms (including lounge) Someone lived in the greenhouse in the garden, in winter. Lounge contained a fat eastern european gangmaster. Rugs covered all the walls. Did not rent.\n\nSaw a tiny box flat with no windows and with claw marks on the doors and blood splattered up the wall. Previous tenant had an 'issue'. Did not rent.\n\nHad to refurb a house I moved into as the strong smell of cat urine flooded the house on warm days (Was shown house only during cold evenings). Landlord attempted to take deposit due to 'changes to decor'. I replastered the walls and repainted them magnolia. Got deposit back after presenting the time stamped images of the house and council environmental health report. \n\nSingle glazed house, on the top of a hill with one open fire and single brick construction. Charming period cottage, cosy wood heating! \n\nLandlord wanted me to write an academic essay to rent a tiny house from him, have references as to my character from multiple sources and an 3 month tenancy. House contained 1000s of blowflys littering all the surfaces.\n\nSaw a house that had one door, that accessed 4 rooms simultaneously depending on the angle. Impossible to escape from due to fire. \n\nSaw a fully contained flat that was a small room with a kitchen in one cupboard and a tiny toilet in another. Illegally small. Expensive.\n\nNext door neighbour is landlord of an illegally subdivided house. Police knock the doors in every month 'just in case' and usually it is justified. Has had the remains of a grow op outside for over a year, and all the good tenants left because of zero maintenance.

Landlord attempts to take deposit for structural changes, told to fuck right off.\n\nRented a tiny flat below sea level. Floods on the regular, usually around high tide. 'You are drying clothes indoors, your problem'. Bedroom was a slot excavated under the road, that had to be boarded up after a visit from environmental health. No reduction in rent. Landlord decided that it was fine to store drain rods in my flat from his plumber. Stopped after I left them outside at risk of theft. Then rented the rest of the building to violent criminals. Left shortly after with police escort.\n\nLandlord rented room in house that included his stoned out of his gourd foul smelling 14 year old son. Was expected to babysit him and keep him out of trouble while the landlord lived in a house 20 miles away. Nope Nope Nope.\n\nLandlord attempted to rent me room with drug paraphernalia on all surfaces visible from outside the house. Didn't even enter house, was berated for wasting his time.\n\nSaw house to rent with no heating, and 8 residents in 4 rooms (including lounge) Someone lived in the greenhouse in the garden, in winter. Lounge contained a fat eastern european gangmaster. Rugs covered all the walls. Did not rent.\n\nSaw a tiny box flat with no windows and with claw marks on the doors and blood splattered up the wall. Previous tenant had an 'issue'. Did not rent.\n\nHad to refurb a house I moved into as the strong smell of cat urine flooded the house on warm days (Was shown house only during cold evenings). Landlord attempted to take deposit due to 'changes to decor'. I replastered the walls and repainted them magnolia. Got deposit back after presenting the time stamped images of the house and council environmental health report. \n\nSingle glazed house, on the top of a hill with one open fire and single brick construction. Charming period cottage, cosy wood heating! \n\nLandlord wanted me to write an academic essay to rent a tiny house from him, have references as to my character from multiple sources and an 3 month tenancy. House contained 1000s of blowflys littering all the surfaces.\n\nSaw a house that had one door, that accessed 4 rooms simultaneously depending on the angle. Impossible to escape from due to fire. \n\nSaw a fully contained flat that was a small room with a kitchen in one cupboard and a tiny toilet in another. Illegally small. Expensive.\n\nNext door neighbour is landlord of an illegally subdivided house. Police knock the doors in every month 'just in case' and usually it is justified. Has had the remains of a grow op outside for over a year, and all the good tenants left because of zero maintenance. Landlord complains constantly about present tenants all being criminals and the cost of doors. Still trying to recover money from tenants many years ago for his maintainance responsibilities.\n\nYou totally should experience the completely unregulated UK housing market sonny if this worries you.

If a person is found to be suffering clinical depression, medication and lifestyle changes and therapy should be prescribed before euthanasia is even discussed. Even Dr. Kevorkian, controversial as he was, refused to help people who didn't have a terminal condition. He turned away people who simply wanted to die.\n\n(For the record, I think wanting to die is a valid reason when it's independent of mental illness. A man and his wife had a doctor's help and died tigether; the wife had a terminal condition and the husband didn't want to live without her. As long as someone is of sound mind, he or she should be able to solicit medical help in regards to completing suicide.)\n\nA mental-health team of therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists should always be on our front lines, because medicine is about saving lives. Medicine is *also*, however, about *improving the quality of life* of people who are in pain. If the quality of a patient's life is deteriorating with no hope for recovery and no means for a reprieve, when death is preferable to waking up in the morning, then the patient should be able to exercise his or her medical autonomy in requesting and being granted a physician's help to make suicide as easy and painless as possible.\n\nI would hope that you are enlightened enough to know that you shouldn't really tell people how to live their lives, right? That it's not your business to tell them what jobs to have, where to go on vacation, what food to eat. Right?\n\nSo why, if you know that it isn't okay for you to tell someone else how to live, why would you ever think it's okay to tell someone how to die?", "id": "dan75vm"}, {"comment": "Yeah, but wasn't her tinnitus so severe that she literally couldn't even live with her family most of the time as just the daily noise was unbearably painful to her.

Encountering a human is just a bonus for the electrons as we represent a path of lesser resistance than atmosphere does. This holds true regardless of the value of I, since I is zero if V is not a high enough potential to overcome R. What's more is that the air along that path, once it's established, becomes ionized by way of transmitting electrons temporarily which reinforces the path of least resistance.\n\n>wouldnt current and voltage have a linear relationship?\n\nThey do, the current is directly proportional to the voltage, but it is *inversely* proportional to the resistance, which in this case is near infinity.\n\nEDIT: Please, if I got any of this wrong let me know random internet folks.

", "id": "daott8i"}, {"comment": "Amperage x Voltage = Wattage", "id": "daouqmp"}, {"comment": "Ignore wattage for a minute. \n\nElectricity is easiest to describe as an analogy to water flow.  Imagine you have a 10 foot pipe sitting on the floor. If you pick up one end of the pipe 1 inch off the floor and pour water in it, the water will just barely trickle down through the pipe. If you pick up the pipe and hold it at a 45 degree angle and pour water it, the water will come gushing out the other end.  The higher the one end of the pipe, the more potential energy the water has and the faster it will move through the pipe.  This is kind of like **voltage** - the higher voltage, the more potential energy it has. \n\nIn this scenario, **amperage** (or **current**) is the rate at which the water flows through the pipe.  This makes sense; we talk about current with water all the time (a river has a fast current or slow current).  In electricity it's the speed that electrons are moving through the circuit. \n\nLets add another factor, **resistance**.  Resistance would be like if we filled the pipe up with marbles and then poured the water into it.  The water now has to work its way through all the marbles, and in general, the water moves slower.  What happens if you increase the resistance and fill the pipe up with sand?  The current decreases. It's harder for the water to make it through all the sand than the marbles.  So if you hold voltage constant (don't change the height of the pipe), when you increase resistance, current decreases.  \n\nWhen you have a single pipe, water can only come out the end at one speed.  So even if the pipe has a layer of gravel, then a layer of marbles, then a layer of sand, water will come out the end at one speed (one current).  Imagine the speed of the water if the pipe was 100% sand or if the pipe was 95% sand and 5% marbles.  The water current would barely even change between these two.  This is why the lightning bolts aren't dangerous - the extremely high resistance of the air is lowering the current to a safe level before the electricity enters the body.  If they were to touch the part that the lightning bolts come out of though, that's probably a bad idea. \n\n**Wattage** is a unit of power - it's just the amount of energy something consumes per unit time.

Ever rub your feet across carpet and then touch a metal doorknob? Zzzzzap. And because you opened the tank and gave it all that vapor access to all the O2 it needs, BOOOOOOM! This reasoning is also why you should never fill a gas can off the ground, btw.\n\nWhereas with a metal tank you can bleed that static charge out by providing it a ground *without* opening the tank up first. Of course, the truck is insulated from ground by the tires so, AFAIK, they clip a grounding wire to the tank before loading or unloading. \n\nSo why did it explode here? Any number of things, but I'd bet it was the cold, dry air that pushed it over the edge. For various reasons the drier the air, and the colder, the worse static discharges get.

As long as the moisture of oxygen is decent enough. ", "id": "dagvm3n"}, {"comment": "It's important to draw the distinction between temperature and heat. Temperature is speed at which particles are vibrating (or more precisely, colliding). Heat is the total amount of energy transferred as a result.\n\nWhen static electricity arcs from one point to another, the immediate temperature is extremely high. However, the mass of particles at that temperature is very low and the amount of time it exists is very short, so very little heat is produced.\n\nFuel ignites when the fuel/air mixture is correct and the ignition temperature is exceeded. So if a spark occurs far away from the fuel, there's too much air and it doesn't ignite. Or if a spark occurs really close to the fuel (assuming it's evaporating fast enough), there's too *little* air and it doesn't ignite.\n\nBut if the spark occurs where the correct ratio exists, then it doesn't matter that the high temperature is extremely localized in time and space. The fuel and air molecules immediately adjacent to the spark ignite, which releases more energy, which ignites more fuel, and so on until all the fuel at the fuel/air boundary is burning.", "id": "dah51wk"}, {"comment": ">  I was under the impression that fuel needs some degree of warm temperature before it can ignite.\n\nDepends on the fuel.  Diesel is pretty tough to ignite and is highly unlikely to ever behave in the manner displayed in this video.  Gasoline, on the other hand.....

I stared in awe at it, not really processing that there were hundreds of mosquitoes sucking blood out of my foot. \n\nThe next morning, I literally could not even put my shoes on. I had to hike about 2.5 miles back to the road barefoot on one foot. \n\nFun times.

Meningitis sucks! \n\nIt took less than 24hrs from the first symptoms to me passing out on the sofa at home. Scary scary disease :/\n\nI only survived because of our house doctor. My parents called him when they didn't manage to wake me up and he somehow correctly diagnosed me over the phone. I was unconscious on the car drive to the hospital but our doctor told my dad to tell hospital staff to instantly give me meningitis meds and not wait for test results. When they didn't do that, he asked my dad to give the phone to the doctor dealing with me...and my dad said he's never heard someone yell at someone like that over the phone before. Everyone in the room heard our house doctors angry yelling. \n\nLong story short, they caved in and gave me the meds almost instantly after that call. The head doctor later admitted this probably saved my life. Spent 2 weeks at the hospital and then had little worms clean the wounds of the (light) Woodstock syndrome I got because of meningitis. \n\nThis stupid amoeba type is only really treatable with experimental stuff as far as I know. The bacterial kind I had is treatable but only if administered quickly...and it's also the most severe kind. Basically, without treatment, the bacterial version is almost always deadly. The viral version isn't treatable but tends to be milder.  \n\n**TIP:**\n\nMeningitis attacks the area surrounding your brain and spinal cords. One sign you might (!!!) have it is if you suddenly can't touch your chin with your knee when normally you can. That's because doing so with meningitis is really really painful. I also had ridiculous fever (41 degrees). Before passing out I took a hot bath because I thought I had a stupid flu...but I was sitting in boiling hot water shivering like someone on Everest. Oh...and total lack of appetite. Of course everything but the knee test can be a symptom of other stuff. \n\nOther than the type described in the OP, people often get it at school camps or the army. Everyone can be a carrier, but the disease doesn't always break out. Having had it once is no guarantee for not getting it again :/\n\n**EDIT:** For those wondering how my doc diagnosed me over the phone with me unconscious. He knew I had been at a ski camp the week before and just a day earlier read in the news that 2 Dutch soldiers training in that area (lol, borrowing our Swiss mountains) got sick of Meningitis. We were sharing the \"Kaserne\" (military camp?) with them during our school ski trip (which he only found out later). So yeah, total luck ;)\n\n**EDIT 2:** It's quite an interesting disease to learn about by the way. The bacterial kind is suuuuuuuuuper rare in the West for example...but in the 90s in killed off 25,000+ in a single year in Sub-Saharan Africa. That's right around the time I had it.

Visitor demographics have been trending toward Western European and Asians for a couple of years now across all of the major parks/monuments.", "id": "damivyc"}, {"comment": "Comments by other posters are correct. For whatever reason, the Grand Canyon is an insanely popular destination for Japanese and German tourists in particular. You can go there and no one around you speaks english. Germans are hikers and will definitely go into the canyon and they also definitely like to follow rules and read signs so this is a good idea. You find tons of well prepared Germans decked out with full survival gear going into the canyon, and none that aren't prepared. Japanese you find taking photos and going a little bit down, and then back up, heeding the signs, since again they are rule followers.\n\nSpanish people don't visit the canyon at all for the most part. Those that do are highly skeptical of authority and don't pay attention to signs. But it's OK, those from Mexico for example (Grand Canyon is not at all a destination for them in general) already know that you need to bring water to survive in the desert. Japan and Germany don't have deserts but Mexico does. Also a bigger, cooler, more bad-ass canyon as well, though not as scenic.\n\nThe sign can't be infinitely large so it caters to the main visitors of the specific site. I don't know how many national parks only have warning signage in German, Japanese and English, but I know it's not many of them. The Grand Canyon is this way because the signs are pragmatic based on the facts on the ground and analysis of what works.\n\nThe sign the guy showed is the sign at the very top. If I remember correctly, the one with the awesome dead bodies is a little bit down on the trail, at the first overlook, for those who need a little more info. The way it works is you are legally required to have a back country hiking permit if you'll be in the canyon overnight. Furthermore, unless you are a serious badass person who has extensive training, you're not going down and back up in a day. People don't realize that. Japanese people in particular are raised in a safe society where they are taken care of and can trust others. The idea that there would be a famous and major tourist destination in which lots of people die and it's easy to get killed just doesn't make sense, it's not something they are familiar with. They assume that if the trail exists, it must be safe. So they need some warnings that that is not so.\n\nMost trails, especially the \"shorter\" ones, feature absolutely no water, absolutely no shade, absolutely no help, no bathrooms, no restaurants, no water fountains, just break desert and pounding sun  with temperatures around 115F in summer and 105F in winter. The average person has never tried to hike out of a mile deep gulch along a steep trail in which the sun pounds down and there is no shade or rest. It takes far longer than they might think. You might run to the bottom in only 3 hrs. But then find it takes 10-15 hrs to get back up. And if you do it with no water, often you just die. And your body bloats up. Bloats up big, twice its normal size. And becomes covered with pink spots. And then the ranger comes, curses you, and takes a photo for the scrapbook. He'll have to file paperwork.

Meningitis sucks! \n\nIt took less than 24hrs from the first symptoms to me passing out on the sofa at home. Scary scary disease :/\n\nI only survived because of our house doctor. My parents called him when they didn't manage to wake me up and he somehow correctly diagnosed me over the phone. I was unconscious on the car drive to the hospital but our doctor told my dad to tell hospital staff to instantly give me meningitis meds and not wait for test results. When they didn't do that, he asked my dad to give the phone to the doctor dealing with me...and my dad said he's never heard someone yell at someone like that over the phone before. Everyone in the room heard our house doctors angry yelling. \n\nLong story short, they caved in and gave me the meds almost instantly after that call. The head doctor later admitted this probably saved my life. Spent 2 weeks at the hospital and then had little worms clean the wounds of the (light) Woodstock syndrome I got because of meningitis. \n\nThis stupid amoeba type is only really treatable with experimental stuff as far as I know. The bacterial kind I had is treatable but only if administered quickly...and it's also the most severe kind. Basically, without treatment, the bacterial version is almost always deadly. The viral version isn't treatable but tends to be milder.  \n\n**TIP:**\n\nMeningitis attacks the area surrounding your brain and spinal cords. One sign you might (!!!) have it is if you suddenly can't touch your chin with your knee when normally you can. That's because doing so with meningitis is really really painful. I also had ridiculous fever (41 degrees). Before passing out I took a hot bath because I thought I had a stupid flu...but I was sitting in boiling hot water shivering like someone on Everest. Oh...and total lack of appetite. Of course everything but the knee test can be a symptom of other stuff. \n\nOther than the type described in the OP, people often get it at school camps or the army. Everyone can be a carrier, but the disease doesn't always break out. Having had it once is no guarantee for not getting it again :/\n\n**EDIT:** For those wondering how my doc diagnosed me over the phone with me unconscious. He knew I had been at a ski camp the week before and just a day earlier read in the news that 2 Dutch soldiers training in that area (lol, borrowing our Swiss mountains) got sick of Meningitis. We were sharing the \"Kaserne\" (military camp?) with them during our school ski trip (which he only found out later). So yeah, total luck ;)\n\n**EDIT 2:** It's quite an interesting disease to learn about by the way. The bacterial kind is suuuuuuuuuper rare in the West for example...but in the 90s in killed off 25,000+ in a single year in Sub-Saharan Africa. That's right around the time I had it. I think it's incredible we live in times where they so easily save 1 person having it here in the West while at the same time letting down 25k people despite there being a cure :((( ", "id": "damgtax"}, {"comment": "Viral meningitis here.

While motorcyclists frequently ride at speeds higher than 20 m/s (45 mph), the perpendicular impact speed of the helmet is usually not the same as the road speed of the motorcycle, and the severity of the impact is determined not only by the speed of the head but also by the surface it hits and the angle of impact. Since the surface of the road is almost parallel to the direction a motorcyclist moves while driving, only a small component of their velocity is directed perpendicularly (though other surfaces may be perpendicular to the motorcyclist's velocity, such as trees, walls, and the sides of other vehicles). The severity of an impact is also influenced by the nature of the surface struck.

During Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.  (Bush administration was super-creative in op names)\n\nThe first time I saw someone legit *fly* was when he ran up the catwalk without using his hand to test the blowback of any jets turning at the time, topside.  Well, An EA-6B prowler has it's engines facing at an angle at the ground, blowing off the side of the ship while turning (engine cranked). So green-pea ran up the catwalk and was instantly blown/shot off the side of the carrier like a piece of paper, tumbling end over end at least 50 feet out, and 60 feet down.  Miraculously, he survived despite his helmet beacon shattering, and sat in the water for 7 hours  before they finally found him at dawn and they saw the green dye from his floatcoat.\n\nSecond time was a storm.  I don't know why the seemingly smart 40+ year old freaking E-8 *Senior Chief*, 18 years in, in charge of 200+ people decided to stand near the bow and lean forward against the storm like he was 8 years old on a rainy sunday back home.  The first major gust blew his helmet clear off.  Like, so far and fast, it just became a green dot on the horizon.  The next gust lifted him clear off his feet and he caught about 20-35 feet of air as the boat pitched and the bow dropped as he got lifted.  He got tossed halfway down the flight deck and came to a rest up against the strut of an F-14, wondering how in the hairy fuck he was still alive after displaying such darwinism.\n\nMy favorite shit ever was sitting in the smoking sponson (balcony hanging off the lower side of the ship), hanging with a buddy on off time, smokin a cig and bullshitting, you know.  All of a sudden 20 feet away, a jet comes over the side of the ship and lands directly in the water, and about 10 seconds later you could see the pilot and his chute a few hundred yards off, safely landing.  Both of us just staring at the 25 million dollar aircraft sinking at a rate I didn't realize was possible.

I'm on a mobile phone ..", "id": "danh16x"}, {"comment": "\"Better\" or \"worse\" are verrrrry subjective terms, my friend. \"More relaxed\" would probably be a better term, and even *that* is debatable - I think that in some respects, gun laws are more relaxed here than in the USA. Allow me to demonstrate:\n\nI live in the Netherlands, so that's the only country I can give in-depth info on. I've been told our gun laws are quite strict for a western European country, so you can probably deduce what this implies for other countries. Anyway, here anyone without a history of violent crime and/or mental illness can aply for a permit. A permit must have a reason or use case - allowed use cases are sports, hunting, collecting, professional use and self defence. \n\nFor sports purposes, one may own up to 5 separate arms. A barrel-chamber-magazine kit to change calibre does not count towards this number, hence such kits are wildly popular here. Under such a permit, one may posses up to 10,000 rounds or bullets (for reloaders). The weapons and their ammunition must be \"fit for sports shooting\", meaning that they must be usable within an officially recognized discipline of target shooting. If you want to buy a gun, you provide the ministry of Security & Justice with the make, model, type and serial number of the weapon you intend to buy. They then allow or disallow said gun. In general, most weapons are allowed except for the following: automatic weapons, short-barreled handguns (\"saturday night specials\" and sub-compacts), handguns w. more than +/- 2000 Joules of muzzle energy (there are no ranges here that can cope with more than a .44 magnum) -, rifles with more than 3500 joules of energy (same reason as above, only w. .308), dedicated long-range rifles (the longest range here is 800 meters. Hey, it's a small country) and shotguns with a magazine capable of holding more than 2 shots (skeet disallows such weapons, so these aren't sports weapons). As for ammunition, only FMJ, (semi-)wad cutter and, in the case of small calibre, lead roundnose bullets are allowed. So, target ammo.\n\nFor hunting, the applicant must be in possession of a separate hunting license. Rifle hunting is only allowed with single-shot or manual repeating weapons - no semi-automatics. Depending on the game, minimum calibres are specified. As for shotguns: bird and small game hunters may use single shot, double barrel, pump-action or semi-auto shotguns if they so desire, but with a maximum magazine capacity of 5 shots. Ammunition must be of the expanding variety for rifles, and leadfree shot for shotguns. I believe a hunter may own up to ten weapons, but I am not sure about that one.\n\nCollecting: The collection must belong to a museum or other such institution, serve a historical or educational purpose and be curated as such. Under no circumstances may the institution be in the possession of any ammunition. Apart from that, anything goes. \n\nProfessional use: Either mandated by law (police, constabulary, military) or through a specific permit (think: weapons traders, VIP protection personnel, veterinarians). Per weapon, a permit must be provided. Said permit also describes rules for carrying and using the weapon. So, a trader may only transit weapons to and from prospective buyers, a body guard may cary his weapon only when the VIP is nearby and a vet may only use his weapon to euthanise livestock, for instance.\n\nThen, self-defense. This is a cryptic category and only a few of these are in existence at any one time. Next to none are issued nowadays, but some people still hold theirs from the 60's and 70's. These were usually issued to dignitaries who were considered to be at risk of assault by extremist groups or criminals. Mostly, they were provided with police or military weapons, which were registered on their permit. Little is known about specifics on these permits.\n\nAs you can see, one can legally own an AR, FAL, .45 pistol, .44 revolver and a .22 carbine for plinking, complete with hi-cap magazines and a stockpile of ammo if one so desires. And we have restrictive laws!

Thankfully, I rarely ever hit it.      \nDoesn't actually cause me any discomfort at all, since it almost doesn't touch the sole.

On the contrary, lil' Hems here is a big help - he got the conscription office off my back, so I won't have to serve (got mandatory conscription for a year round these parts).    \nAccording to the docs, it's too big to be removed via fancy-shmancy stuff like...freezing...lasers (actually tried that, twice)...and, uh, other fancy stuff, only by chopping it off with the skin and then getting some skin from somewhere else or something like that, so I was like \"fuuuuuuck that\".

A wooden log is kept in a part of the house. Children give it food (that parents in secret eat, giving the illusion the log is eating) during December, and on Christmas Eve, kids beat the crap out of the log with a stick while singing a song, and underneath it, gifts appear (as if the log had 'crapped' them out). \"El ti\u00f3\" is often decorated with a face and a barretina (Catalan hat), to add insult to injury.  \nTo outsiders, the whole \"beating a log so it craps presents\" can be WTF-worthy, yet it's seen as very traditional and typical here.  \nEDIT: However, the \"ti\u00f3\" and the \"caganer\" are unrelated things. You can do both during Christmas. If you don't have kids (under 12 or so) you won't do the \"ti\u00f3\" though, as it's a kids-only thing.", "id": "dahsc4u"}, {"comment": "> On Christmas Day or, in some households, on Christmas Eve, one puts the ti\u00f3 partly into the fireplace and orders it to defecate. The fire part of this tradition is no longer as widespread as it once was, since many modern homes do not have a fireplace. To make it defecate, one beats the ti\u00f3 with sticks, while singing various songs of Ti\u00f3 de Nadal. The tradition says that before beating the ti\u00f3 all the kids have to leave the room and go to another place of the house to pray, asking for the ti\u00f3 to deliver a lot of presents. This makes the perfect excuse for the relatives to do the trick and put the presents under the blanket while the kids are praying. The ti\u00f3 does not drop larger objects, as those are considered to be brought by the Three Wise Men. It does leave candies, nuts and torrons. Depending on the region of Catalonia, it may also give out dried figs. When nothing is left to \"shit\", it drops a salt herring, a head of garlic, an onion, or it \"urinates\" by leaving a bowl of water. What comes out of the Ti\u00f3 is a communal rather than individual gift, shared by everyone there. The ti\u00f3 is often popularly called Caga ti\u00f3 (\"Shitting log\", \"Poo log\"),. This derives from the many songs of Ti\u00f3 de Nadal that begin with this phrase, which was originally (in the context of the songs) an imperative (\"Shit, log!\"). The use of this expression as a name is not believed to be part of the ancient tradition.\n\nSource: Wiki\n\nUhhhhh", "id": "daimsl4"}, {"comment": "You know, a fat man with a beard that brings presents to children is way too unoriginal.

That's why a lot of high performance cars have a popping sound coming from the exhaust when they let off the throttle, it's just backfiring a little. Usually because of too much gas in the air mixture, or advanced timing that lets a little gas out before the cylinder fires. \n\nSo it makes sense that the gas vapors could ignite upon touching the exhaust manifolds. Especially if that white car has been sitting and idling (no air flowing over the exhaust). \n\nSide note; if your car every starts backfiring through the exhaust, and you didn't tune it to do that, just change your spark plugs and check the plug cables. I had a car that was doing that and it was just one messed up plug not sparking, which meant that cylinder was just dumping un combusted gasoline into the exhaust.

Through hard work and good fortune I've been able to have a very smooth university career up to this point. Vet med is considered pretty difficult to get into but I pulled it off my first shot, which is pretty nice. That means I'll have done 6 years of post secondary (2 years of pre-reqs, 4 years of med) at my time of graduation. A lot of people in my class will have 8 years or more under their belt by that time. \n\nSo far, I've gotta say the coolest thing I've done so far is a neuter surgery on a little puppy (so super cute): it was my first ever surgery, albeit a minor surgery, but still very cool! I also think that anesthesia is very cool. Inducing and maintaining an animal in general anesthesia by myself is straight up amazing imo. \n\nMy personal interest has honestly changed quite a lot from when I started this, currently I'm sitting at around 70% small animal (refers to the common pets dogs and cats, usually stuff like bunnies and reptiles and the like are done at specialized clinics but there it depends strongly on the clinic), 30% equine. \n\nThat being said, we still have to learn the basics for everything. So, my curriculum has a lot of focus on cattle, although I pretty much guarantee I won't touch a cow in a clinical setting after grad I still have to know it. \n\nMedicine is medicine, there is massive overlap between human med and vet med because, obviously, we are mammals. Some people come into vet med hoping to escape people, but *surprise* people own the animals. Lol. \n\nI wouldn't change a thing thus far to this point, it is very difficult but getting that 'Doctor' in front of your name shouldn't be easy! The stress is a pretty well known aspect of med school (vet or human) and you just have to learn to deal with it as you go. My small class has had 2 people drop out, one at the end of 1st year and one halfway through 2nd year. From what I've seen, we will not lose anybody else. \n\nI'm just wrapping up this semester now (finals in 2 weeks), and then one more semester, and then a year of clinical rotations where basically we go to various clinics potentially all around the world and act as 'vets with supervision'. Getting sick of lectures for sure, looking very much forward to that! \n", "id": "dapddj5"}, {"comment": "> Hypopyon is even better, when there's pus there instead of blood.\n\nFuck you for making me Google that...", "id": "danz6i9"}, {"comment": "What causes this?", "id": "danpp3r"}, {"comment": "Several things can cause it.
