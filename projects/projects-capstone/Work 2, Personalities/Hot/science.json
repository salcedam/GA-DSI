There are plenty of things that science hasn't yet explained that don't have misleading names attached to them.

They are very massive but also very difficult if not impossible to detect if they aren't active and given that all of the population 3 stars should be dead by now, it seems reasonable that we have more black holes floating around than we thought.

It would be very silly of astronomers not to account for that their calculations.\n\nInstead, some look to the idea of primordial black holes, which may have formed in the early days of the universe, before the formation of galaxies.  Since we know little about this time, the possibility exists that the are black holes that formed in the chaos of the big bang and the time \"shortly\" thereafter.  But it's important to remember that black were just proven by direct observation just this year, we still have a lot to learn about the distribution of black holes in the universe.\n\nThe idea that large, dark objects could be responsible for dark matter was, of course, an early candidate for dark matter.  Since we would need much of that mass to exist in the halo of the galaxy(the space outside of the main disk), they were called massive compact halo objects, or MACHOs.  I don't think they have not been entirely ruled out, but it's not looking good.  Such objects would be indirectly observable via the effects of gravitational lensing, but extensive searches turned up nothing.  It suggests that large objects reside within galaxies, not outside of them, and it makes black holes a weak candidate for dark matter.\n\nAstronomers really want to answer the question of dark matter.

For example, with a gram of water, the entire mass has a phase change at a certain pressure and temperature.

Yes, it's an anecdote, but it's my anecdote so it matters to me.\n\nWe bought one of the motion sensor things for our daughter. To get it set up right, I had to cut and sand to a polish a piece of plywood to go over the springs, under the mattress, to make sure it had a smooth surface to sit on to pick up vibrations. And that's what I did the day my daughter came home from the hospital.\n\nAnyway, the problem was it was a big crib, and she was a tiny baby, and she found ways to roll over or scoot into a far end where sensor couldn't pick up her movements. She could roll onto her stomach from like 4 months old, no matter that we always put her down on her back. The sensor was the kind that would beep once at 15 seconds, then go ape shit at 20 seconds until there was movement or we turned it off. It was annoying if we picked her up and forgot to switch it off, and when she rolled herself into a corner and it beeped we'd try to get in there (our stomping in on pier-and-beam floor would reset it) then move her back before she woke.\n\nSo one time, she's maybe 6-7 months old, I hear that first beep. I'm a bit slow getting in there, so just as I open the door the alarm starts its full-on blare. Except this time, she's not in a corner. She's face down in the middle of the bed, and as the alarm goes off she does this whole body frightened shudder. I pick her up and she's not crying, just startled by the loud noise.\n\nAnyway, I could never prove it, but to me that was the one time the baby monitor saved my daughter's life. I think she had stopped breathing, and the alarm startled her body into starting again.\n\nIf I could do it again, I'd buy the slightly more expensive unit that came with two motion plates instead of one.", "id": "dalnmin"}, {"comment": "Interesting!

Before my daughter had neck control I'd actually turn her head a bit while she slept (even knowing it doesn't happen i was still paranoid.) but now it wouldn't do any good because she can turn it back. Also, kids don't spontaneously spit up unless they have a reflux issue and then the baby will be sleeping on an incline. Normal spit up happens for one of two reasons: 1. Baby has overfed (rare if breastfed) or 2. There is air trapped and it pushes the milk out along with the air. That's why you take breaks to burp the baby, to get the air out before it gets trapped under a bunch of fluid. If the baby falls asleep ans you don't want to wake them up to burp them just hold them upright for 15-20 minutes to help the bubble work its way out - this also helps for reflux. My girl is 12 weeks this week and we don't even pat her back anymore, we can just hold her up and she'll burp for us. Sorry for any errors, I'm writing this one handed while she's asleep in my arms.

They were compared with counterparts from the extant genera Trechisibus, Tasmanorites, Oxytrechus and Pseudocnides. The fossils share some characters but are sufficiently different to be described as a new genus and species. We named the new species Antarctotrechus balli in honour of George E. Ball who made major contributions to the study of carabids through his own research and the training of students while at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The closest extant relatives to the extinct A. balli are species of Trechisibus, which inhabit South America, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, and Tasmanorites, which inhabit Tasmania, Australia. Plant fossils associated with A. balli included Nothofagus (southern beech), Ranunculus (buttercup), moss mats and cushion plants that were part of a tundra biome. Collectively, the stratigraphic relationships and the growth characteristics of the fossil plants indicate that A. balli inhabited the sparsely-vegetated banks of a stream that was part of an outwash plain at the head of a fjord in the Transantarctic Mountains. Other insects represented by fossils in the tundra biome include a listroderine weevil and a cyclorrhaphan fly. The age of the fossils, based on comparison of associated pollen with 40Ar/39Ar dated pollen assemblages from the McMurdo Dry Valleys, is probably Early to Mid-Miocene in the range 14\u201320 Ma. The tundra biome, including A. balli, became extinct in the interior of Antarctica about 14 Ma and on the margins of the continent by 10\u201313 Ma. A. balli confirms that trechines were once widely distributed in Gondwana. For A. balli and other elements of the tundra biome it appears they continued to inhabit a warmer Antarctica for many millions of years after rifting of Tasmania (45 Ma) and southern South America (31 Ma)."]], [[{"comment": "[A.

The fossils share some characters but are sufficiently different to be described as a new genus and species. We named the new species Antarctotrechus balli in honour of George E. Ball who made major contributions to the study of carabids through his own research and the training of students while at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The closest extant relatives to the extinct A. balli are species of Trechisibus, which inhabit South America, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, and Tasmanorites, which inhabit Tasmania, Australia. Plant fossils associated with A. balli included Nothofagus (southern beech), Ranunculus (buttercup), moss mats and cushion plants that were part of a tundra biome. Collectively, the stratigraphic relationships and the growth characteristics of the fossil plants indicate that A. balli inhabited the sparsely-vegetated banks of a stream that was part of an outwash plain at the head of a fjord in the Transantarctic Mountains. Other insects represented by fossils in the tundra biome include a listroderine weevil and a cyclorrhaphan fly. The age of the fossils, based on comparison of associated pollen with 40Ar/39Ar dated pollen assemblages from the McMurdo Dry Valleys, is probably Early to Mid-Miocene in the range 14\u201320 Ma. The tundra biome, including A. balli, became extinct in the interior of Antarctica about 14 Ma and on the margins of the continent by 10\u201313 Ma. A. balli confirms that trechines were once widely distributed in Gondwana. For A. balli and other elements of the tundra biome it appears they continued to inhabit a warmer Antarctica for many millions of years after rifting of Tasmania (45 Ma) and southern South America (31 Ma).", "id": "dajkb8m"}]]], "5eqfle": ["How northern freshwater input can stabilise thermohaline circulation", "2016-11-25 01:57:46", 0, "http://www.tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/31051", [], []], "5gb8l7": ["Parkinson's Disease Linked to Microbiome.

The evidence that the ice deposits in Utopia, Galaxias, and North Hellas (among other places on Mars) is water ice, not CO2 ice comes from a few lines of evidence:\n\n1) Water ice is more stable than CO2 ice (which sublimates at 150 K). The near-subsurface in these mid-latitude locations is usually warmer than the frost point of CO2, so any CO2 ice at these locations would have sublimated away. \n\n2) The speed of radar waves through water ice and CO2 are are different--radar waves move faster through CO2 ice than through water ice. In Cassie's study (as well as other studies of ice cored glacial deposits), by measuring the thickness of the deposits and the time it takes the radar to travel through them, we can determine the speed at which the radar waves moved (distance / time = velocity).

Plans are underway to test it in 600 HIV-negative subjects across North America as early as next fall. The Phase II trial, once approved by government regulatory agencies, will determine the vaccine\u2019s ability to produce anti-HIV antibodies in patients who are not infected with the virus.\n\nThe\u00a0results of the Phase I trial\u00a0were published this week in the journal,\u00a0Retrovirology, and showed that the vaccine is both safe for use and effective in triggering an anti-HIV immune response in HIV-positive patients. The results demonstrated that the vaccine was well tolerated with no serious adverse events and can now proceed to Phase II.\n\nDeveloped by Chil-Yong Kang and a research team at Western\u2019s\u00a0Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, the vaccine was tested in 33 HIV-positive volunteers. The proposed next phase will involve 300 volunteers from the general population, and 300 from groups considered high-risk including men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users, sex workers, and those living with an HIV-positive partner.\n\n\u201cWe were very excited with the Phase I results,\u201d said Kang, a professor in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology at Western. \u201cThe trial demonstrated that our vaccine stimulates broadly neutralizing antibodies that will neutralize not only single sub-types of HIV, but other sub-types, which means that you can have the vaccine cover many different strains of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe SAV001 vaccine is unique in that it uses a killed whole HIV-1, much like the killed whole virus used in vaccines for polio, hepatitis A, rabies, and the flu. The killed HIV-1 is genetically engineered so it is less dangerous and can be produced in large quantities. The vaccine is the world\u2019s first preventative HIV vaccine using genetically modified killed whole-virus to receive approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to proceed to this phase of human clinical trials.\n\n\u201cIf we can show that this vaccine is effective in preventing people from contracting HIV, we can stop the AIDS epidemic and that would be tremendous,\u201d said Kang. \u201cIt would be a tremendous contribution to humankind, and it would make all of our efforts worthwhile.\u201d\n\nHIV/AIDS has killed more than 41 million people worldwide, and more than 35 million people currently live with the infection.\n\n\u201cIt remains to be determined whether this immune response triggered by the vaccine will prevent HIV infection in humans, but we are hopeful,\u201d said Kang.\n\nOnce Phase II has been successfully completed, Phase III will be conducted world-wide with 6,000 subjects and will be the true test to show if the vaccine is effective in protecting people against HIV infection.\n\nThe vaccine is being tested in partnership with Sumagen Canada, the Canadian branch of Korean pharmaceutical venture company, Sumagen Co.

If I recall correctly (I'll find some reviews to edit in later), only about 1/3 of HIV infected people produce broadly neutralizing antibodies, and this only occurs after years of chronic infection. The bNAbs all result from extensive somatic hypermutation, and many of them are characterized by features such as extra long CDRH3 loops not found in human germline sequences (an extra long CDRH3 is needed to penetrate the glycan coat of the HIV Env protein and bind to the peptide itself). \n\n\nWe now enter the realm of speculation. My guess would be that these HIV infected people have, as a result of their chronic infection, already developed a population of B-cells with sets of mutations that enable binding to HIV, and that act as a precursor to the more extensive mutations that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. The delivery of this 'killed' HIV and, in particular, adjuvant could have kickstarted a much more rapid immune response due to a huge increase in serum viral load compared to what would be seen in a normal infection. Because the immune system was already partway there, this allowed for rapid development of new bNAbs. I suspect that in un-infected individuals without the immune priming of an existing infection, this bNAb response will not be able to happen nearly as quickly, and may require a large number of boosts over a long period of time (months? years?) to be effective.\n\nIn a slightly unrelated note, I'm somewhat shocked they didn't test any clade C viruses for neutralization, seeing as it represents a near majority (large plurality) of global HIV-1 infections. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtypes_of_HIV#/media/File:HIV-1_subtype_prevalence_in_2002.png\n\nEdit: OK, so looks like the 30% figure for bNAbs refers to early infection.

The innovative data presented here provides the first evidence of bone working, through sawing, using a specific kind of flint tools. Our evidence is considerably different in nature from that which concerns the modification of bone through use or grinding activities, suggested by several South African findings dating back to the Early Stone Age2,5. It also clearly differs from the shaping of tools (or flake knapping) of large animals\u2019 bones, performed through flaking (e.g., using a hammerstone30,31), well known from the Lower Palaeolithic Acheulean.\n\n> The results of this study allow us to argue that at Qesem Cave, hominins were bringing selected body parts of hunted game to the cave and, after the meat, fat, and marrow were consumed, they occasionally used the discarded animal bones for non-dietary purposes. Had the bone been an isolated find, we would not easily rule out the possibility that the sawing mark was made accidentally. Yet with the current evidence of bone working use-wear and bone residues on flint tools and the sawing mark, we can state that the Qesem hominins used the bone for a non-nutritional activity and this fact can be related to the inclusion of new materials in their cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire. The data presented here represents an innovative behaviour, practised between 420 and 300\u2009kya, possibly the oldest evidence related to intentional non-dietary modification of bone through the use of specific stone tools. Moreover, our results are in perfect accordance with additional evidence related to a non-dietary exploitation of hard animal materials recorded at the site \u2013 i.e., the use of bone fragments as bone retouchers12.\n\n> In summary, the outstanding preservation and the application of an integrated multidisciplinary approach allowed us to identify direct and indirect evidence of bone working using stone tools at this early date. This demonstrates that the technological knowledge traditionally regarded as an expression of the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic sapiens cognitive sphere \u2013 i.e., the production of objects made of animal bones \u2013 was present at Qesem Cave. Our finds are significant to the debate of whether pre-sapiens hominins mastered bone tool production. Moreover, our results shift the debate significantly back in time, necessitating a reassessment of the evidence considered to document behavioural modernity\n\nTLDR: Probably making bone tools, but it is hard to say definitively.

Onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition lifetime mental disorders was assessed with the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, complemented by parent report. Onset of lifetime medical conditions and doctor-diagnosed diseases was assessed by self-report.\n\n>**Results**\n\n>The most substantial temporal associations with onset of mental disorders preceding onset of physical diseases included those between affective disorders and arthritis (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.36, 95%-confidence interval (CI) = 1.95 to 5.77) and diseases of the digestive system (HR = 3.39, CI = 2.30 to 5.00), between anxiety disorders and skin diseases (HR = 1.53, CI = 1.21 to 1.94), and between substance use disorders and seasonal allergies (HR = 0.33, CI = 0.17 to 0.63). The most substantial temporal associations with physical diseases preceding mental disorders included those between heart diseases and anxiety disorders (HR = 1.89, CI = 1.41 to 2.52), epilepsy and eating disorders (HR = 6.27, CI = 1.58 to 24.96), and heart diseases and any mental disorder (HR = 1.39, CI = 1.11 to 1.74).\n\n>**Conclusions**\n\n>Findings suggest that mental disorders are antecedent risk factors of certain physical diseases in early life, but also vice versa.

Onset of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition lifetime mental disorders was assessed with the fully structured World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, complemented by parent report. Onset of lifetime medical conditions and doctor-diagnosed diseases was assessed by self-report.\n\n>**Results**\n\n>The most substantial temporal associations with onset of mental disorders preceding onset of physical diseases included those between affective disorders and arthritis (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.36, 95%-confidence interval (CI) = 1.95 to 5.77) and diseases of the digestive system (HR = 3.39, CI = 2.30 to 5.00), between anxiety disorders and skin diseases (HR = 1.53, CI = 1.21 to 1.94), and between substance use disorders and seasonal allergies (HR = 0.33, CI = 0.17 to 0.63). The most substantial temporal associations with physical diseases preceding mental disorders included those between heart diseases and anxiety disorders (HR = 1.89, CI = 1.41 to 2.52), epilepsy and eating disorders (HR = 6.27, CI = 1.58 to 24.96), and heart diseases and any mental disorder (HR = 1.39, CI = 1.11 to 1.74).\n\n>**Conclusions**\n\n>Findings suggest that mental disorders are antecedent risk factors of certain physical diseases in early life, but also vice versa.

If you work in a low skilled profession, your job probably doesn't change much from year to year and it wouldn't take you long to get back up to speed. But in a highly skilled profession, the chances of rules/laws/systems changing are much higher. For example, with accountancy, the tax legislation would change every year, so when a woman came back from maternity leave, not only had she missed out on a year of experience, but she needed to be retrained in all the legislation changes and computer software changes. Now admittedly *every* accountant needs to have some retraining each year... but when new laws or software came into effect, the whole firm would learn together, which was more efficient. Doing separate training months/years later for a returning mother was much less efficient and overall cost the company more, and until she got caught up, her work would have to be more thoroughly checked for mistakes, which again costs the company money.\n\nOverall, a returning mother was similar to taking on an entirely new employee in terms of how much of other employees' time had to go into getting her back up to speed.", "id": "daqgjf6"}], [{"comment": "**TL;DR;** This study used data from the [National Longitudinal Survey of Youth](http://www.bls.gov/nls/), which tracked 4,658 women from 1976 to 2010.

In cases where depression, or low self-esteem, exists, it would find the opposite effect, where self is viewed irrationally worse than others.\n\nI think the experiment, to work accurately, would need to screen the participants beforehand, to determine the variable of how rational/irrational they are in various other situations, operating as a standard average to compare results of self-perception vs selflessness, so the determination of more precisely what the irrationality in recalling memories of self-image may be. The average person, technically speaking, is not what I think the experiment even considered, with the average person, being self-driven in US society, but socially driven in older societies, so undeterminable, remaining instead an abstract idea, and not an actual relatable scale to compare.\n\nThis effect, while this study says its effect or reason isn't determined, would fall under various related functions for why this is viewed for happening. The coined name of this mechanism would be the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning\u2013Kruger_effect), which is more broad in definition than just this.\n\nHow 'Self-image vs Reality' works, it may not even technically be correct to say this is 'irrational' behavior, technically speaking. It would be self-delusion, yes, but rational for the reasons for why this occurs, being related to self-preservation and survival, where this occurring allows greater chances of mating and overcoming challenges which could be beyond their self. With this mechanism, mentally being able to not succumb to a lost cause, allows greater odds of being able to adapt and overcome. In this 'underdog' situation, this 'irrationality' of viewing self as greater than reality, is not really what I would say is irrational behavior, even though it could be viewed as such, as it removes the rational-based fears that would occur if they rationally determined that they aren't capable initially.

A crafted, semi-solicited situation, where the bystander effect is avoided by making participants the only help available/possible, so they are indirectly solicited to help. Afterwards, they are then informed of the experiment and questioned on their perceived choices that occurred, or mental processes of why they acted as such.

I kind of messed up by not taking as many AP classes as I probably could but I am maintaining a good amount of As so is there anything I can do outside of school to prepare me to get into the field? Additionally, how difficult is it to break into the field of study? How do you deal with overall ignorance in our society and people simply not caring about this issue? I have honestly had periods where I felt depressed because no one seems to care or know about the issues going on. Also, what do you think of veganism as a way to help reduce carbon footprints? Does animal agriculture really make as much of an impact as vegans say? I've heard some sources say animal agriculture around the world accounts for 51% of carbon/greens house gas emissions.

I\u2019ll try to answer a few of your questions.\n\nIt's so nice to hear about your enthusiasm to learn science and passion your for the Earth!\nYou haven't screwed up by not taking AP classes; take them when you can, and try to learn as much as you can. I had a geology class in high school my senior year, and that's when I decided to pursue science. The vocabulary of any discipline is one of the first things you have to try to learn, and it just takes practice. Read as much as you can, but look up words you don\u2019t understand and write down the definition and context. Just like you would practice for a 2nd language class, make vocabulary lists and test yourself repeatedly. \n\nMy advice to you as you prepare for college is to take as many math and science classes as you can, and do well in them...and do well in your other classes. It can be tough, some STEM classes can be really challenging, but don\u2019t give up, some concepts just need to be studied more.\n\nIn college, I majored in geology and took classes like calculus, biology, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, Earth's history/historical geology, petrology, sedimentology and stratigraphy, structural geology, hydrology, climatology, paleoclimatology, climate and human evolution, statistics, physical and chemical oceanography...then even more classes in oceanography, Earth systems modeling, and statistics in grad school.\n\nPeople who study the environment and climate change can have backgrounds in any number of fields including (now I'm going to write a partial list, as people decide to study science at any stage in life and may come from any number of backgrounds...help me out /u/MarineScientists): geography, environmental science (economics and policy), biology, math (statistics, computer modeling), computer science, climatology, marine biology, ecology, chemistry, marine science, marine geology, physics, geophyisics, oceanography (physical, chemical, biological, geological), english (language or literature majors), sedimentology, geomorphology, ....\n\nYou should also join STEM clubs at your school or near where you live. Science museums are really cool and have a lot of neat content online like https://www.si.edu/ or http://www.amnh.org/ and many others. Follow scientists and science organizations on social media.\n\n\nPeople can be vegan for any number of dietary or environmental or moral/social justice/human health reasons...I'll write about what I know about the contribution of land use changes on climate change and why vegans abstain from animal products.\n\nLand use changes usually refers to changes to the land surface (including removing trees and other vegetation) for the purpose of agriculture or ranching. Removing forests (clear-cutting, burning) for farms and cattle ranches changes the land surface from a dark-green densely-forested region to a lighter-colored less-vegetated landscape which changes the energy balance at Earth\u2019s surface. The color-change (albedo) reflects more heat and light at Earth\u2019s surface which alters the temperature and moisture balance from relatively low temperatures and high moisture (forest) to higher temperatures and lower moisture (farm or ranch). Additionally, large amounts of carbon are stored in forests, and removing that carbon by clear-cutting and burning that carbon releases CO2 into the atmosphere which enhances the greenhouse effect, in turn enhancing warming. Also, animal agriculture reduces carbon storage (and area of land that removes carbon from the atmosphere) and produces a lot of methane (from farts!) another greenhouse gas that is better at trapping heat than CO2. \n\nWikipedia says https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use,_land-use_change_and_forestry  the IPCC estimates that land-use change (e.g. conversion of forest into agricultural land) contributes a net 1.6 \u00b1 0.8 Gt carbon per year to the atmosphere. For comparison, the major source of CO2, namely emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production amount to 6.3 \u00b1 0.6 Gt carbon per year. (http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/10.htm) \n\nSo roughly \u00bc to \u2153 of the carbon emissions from human society are due to agriculture (veggies and animals). One aspect to the vegan argument is that you reduce your personal carbon footprint by refusing to use, consume, or buy goods that are produced by changing the land in a way that contributes to climate change. This can include cattle ranching (beef), palm oil (in a lot of processed foods), and any number of other unsustainable agricultural practices. Burning forests for growing other crops also creates a lot of pollution nearby that is unhealthy for people who live there, for example in Indonesia http://time.com/4562009/indonesia-haze-forest-fires-palm-oil-deforestation/ \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/sep/14/indonesia-forest-fires-palm-oil-sumatra-climate-change-peat-companies-unep\n\nGood luck in your studies!", "id": "daq1mxo"}, {"comment": "Oh my goodness!

If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30 \u00b1 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 \u00b1 161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55 \u00b1 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 12\u201317 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbon\u2013climate feedback that could accelerate climate change.\n\nEDIT: [Online access to this article has been shared by the author(s) via Springer Nature SharedIt.](http://www.nature.com/articles/nature20150.epdf?author_access_token=mNyqsDrlWtngnsaN-HNmMdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mik0TTmks8PdSiUZYeb2RTazzd23X-2n0E69QMlRUrO7yrjNUEPchC6cifVcFKJiT3ls3kWZzg62VczK5bjYQ6)"], [87, "[removed]"], [51, "If we're experiencing a decade's worth of the warmest years on record, has this impact been measurable yet?"], [46, "So maybe a world as described in interstellar?"], [29, "[removed]"], [12, "[removed]"], [83, "\"Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55\u2009\u00b1\u200950 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050.\"\n\n55\u2009\u00b1\u200950 ?

If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30 \u00b1 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 \u00b1 161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55 \u00b1 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 12\u201317 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbon\u2013climate feedback that could accelerate climate change.\n\nEDIT: [Online access to this article has been shared by the author(s) via Springer Nature SharedIt.](http://www.nature.com/articles/nature20150.epdf?author_access_token=mNyqsDrlWtngnsaN-HNmMdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mik0TTmks8PdSiUZYeb2RTazzd23X-2n0E69QMlRUrO7yrjNUEPchC6cifVcFKJiT3ls3kWZzg62VczK5bjYQ6)", "id": "damdchc"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "damogym"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "damr8gn"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "damrsek"}], [{"comment": "If we're experiencing a decade's worth of the warmest years on record, has this impact been measurable yet?", "id": "damkjaf"}, {"comment": "Yup.

My wife actually went into labor on Thursday morning at around 6:00 am without realizing it (she awoke with some minor clear discharge, and then went to work all day without realizing that the discharge was actually a rupture (basically, her water broke)). The pregnancy was only about 37.5 weeks, and the due date wasn't actually until December 6th. While 37 weeks isn't technically considered \"premature\", it *was* considered \"preterm\".\n\nThe baby was 6 lbs, 2 oz (~2.78 kg), and during her extended stay at the hospital, which ended up being 5 days, she lost about 14 oz (~0.4 kg); this is the reason they kept her longer, and they were finally able to come home last night. My wife is breastfeeding, and they have recommended that we supplement the breastfeeding with formula, due to formula being higher in calories, to facilitate weight gain.\n\nMy wife has never in her life drank alcohol, used drugs (other than those prescribed to her), or used tobacco products. She did not have any known STDs, STIs, or other infections. She was very careful during the pregnancy to take her prenatal vitamins as directed, and stayed on a *very* strict diet (no junk food, no deli meats (listeria risk), no caffeine, etc.), yet the baby was born preterm regardless and still had complications during delivery. We did not have any sexual intercourse after finding out about the pregnancy, despite the fact that all sources said it was safe, my wife did not feel comfortable with the idea.\n\nI'm wondering if you could shed some light on what may have possibly gone wrong? For the delivery complications, her doctor said the baby was face up in the birth canal, and that my wife's birth canal was just too narrow, even for such a small baby, so he ordered the C-section to prevent harm to both mother and baby. Maybe your research can provide some insight as to what happened. Additionally, do you know if there are any long-term implications associated with this, in terms of harming the baby?

Accordingly, a positive PSA test was also significantly correlated with GBS carriage. GBS is generally not considered an STI, and the influence of sexual behavior on vaginal GBS carriage or acquisition is a matter of debate [92\u201394]. **Based on published literature and our own data, we hypothesize that sexual activity might lead to a brief temporal GBS colonization of the vagina.** This hypothesis is strengthened by a recent longitudinal deep-sequencing study of the vaginal microbiome, where 25 women were sampled on a daily basis over a 10 week period, revealing an average of 0.39 GBS episodes per week and an average GBS episode of 2.8 days (Fig 1 and additional file 4 in [95]), contrasting with earlier studies\u2014where sampling occurred every 3 weeks\u2014that report average GBS episodes of 13.7 weeks [96]. The brief colonization might explain why we and other authors find parameters such as \u2018age of first sexual intercourse\u2019 not to be associated with GBS carriage (they do not cover the recent aspect), while parameters such as \u2018high frequency of intercourse during last month\u2019 (as a consequence, a higher chance of also having had recent intercourse) do correlate.

My wife actually went into labor on Thursday morning at around 6:00 am without realizing it (she awoke with some minor clear discharge, and then went to work all day without realizing that the discharge was actually a rupture (basically, her water broke)). The pregnancy was only about 37.5 weeks, and the due date wasn't actually until December 6th. While 37 weeks isn't technically considered \"premature\", it *was* considered \"preterm\".\n\nThe baby was 6 lbs, 2 oz (~2.78 kg), and during her extended stay at the hospital, which ended up being 5 days, she lost about 14 oz (~0.4 kg); this is the reason they kept her longer, and they were finally able to come home last night. My wife is breastfeeding, and they have recommended that we supplement the breastfeeding with formula, due to formula being higher in calories, to facilitate weight gain.\n\nMy wife has never in her life drank alcohol, used drugs (other than those prescribed to her), or used tobacco products. She did not have any known STDs, STIs, or other infections. She was very careful during the pregnancy to take her prenatal vitamins as directed, and stayed on a *very* strict diet (no junk food, no deli meats (listeria risk), no caffeine, etc.), yet the baby was born preterm regardless and still had complications during delivery. We did not have any sexual intercourse after finding out about the pregnancy, despite the fact that all sources said it was safe, my wife did not feel comfortable with the idea.\n\nI'm wondering if you could shed some light on what may have possibly gone wrong? For the delivery complications, her doctor said the baby was face up in the birth canal, and that my wife's birth canal was just too narrow, even for such a small baby, so he ordered the C-section to prevent harm to both mother and baby. Maybe your research can provide some insight as to what happened. Additionally, do you know if there are any long-term implications associated with this, in terms of harming the baby? Is it likely to happen again in subsequent pregnancies?", "id": "dacgq6t"}, {"comment": "Can I hop in an point you at r/breastfeeding in regards to the breastfeeding and supplementing?

Very basically, to break carbon dioxide (CO2) down to a carbon atom that you want to incorporate into your body would require 749 kJ/mol for each of two double bonds, while breaking a silicate (SiO4) molecule down to a silicon atom would require 799 kJ/mol for each of four single bonds. At least the vast majority of organisms that make use of silicon (as far as I'm aware) use the inorganic silicate form, which suggests that the usefulness of silicon doesn't outweigh the enormous energy that would be needed to get over the hump of converting it to an organic form. Silicon-carbon and silicon-silicon bonds are also longer than carbon-carbon bonds and take less energy to break (435 and 327 vs 607 kJ/mol).  If it becomes a lot easier to break the bonds of everything keeping you alive and holding you together, it's effectively going to take more energy to maintain them. Inorganic carbon is easily grabbed from the atmosphere or bodies of water (which also generally circulate a lot more rapidly and reliably than the ground, where silicates are most abundant) and readily dissolves in water, compared to the relatively low solubility of silicates (there is an aqueous silicate cycle that allows things like diatoms and radiolarians to exist in huge numbers, though), so it's a lot easier to grab more carbon when you need it (on Earth as we know it). \n\nAll you really have to do is be less efficient at reproducing per unit of energy than the competing organism to lose the evolutionary race (all else being equal and barring some stroke of luck), so even if your reduced efficiency isn't fatal, it may just be that much of an evolutionary disadvantage. I'm tempted to say that it's absolutely not true that silicon-based life could have evolved just as easily as carbon-based life on Earth as we know it, as this article says, but I won't go so far as to say it's not possible. Maybe it has happened and we just don't know about it.

It has been happening more and more as we build strong magnets.  An Italian surgeon-scientist (Vincenzo Marcelli) was doing a study looking closely at the eyes during an fMRI and saw there was this nystagmus (to-and-fro movement to the eyes) and speculated the inner ear was involved.  We knew from studies from Thomas Houpt and others than mice seemed to experience vertigo in REALLY strong MRI and this seemed to be due to the inner ear balance mechanism, for if you destroyed this mechanism, the animals were not affected.

The effect is gone in people who have no inner ear balance function on either side as a result of disease.\n\nSo to fill you in on the physiology:  The inner ear in humans (and all mammals) is composed of three angular accelerometers (the semicircular canals) and two linear accelerometers (utricle and saccule).  (See picture).  The sensory cell of these structures are called hair cells because they look like tiny hairs.  As the hairlike projections of these cells are deflected, the firing rates of the attached neurons either increase or decrease about a baseline rate.  Important point #1 for this magnetic phenomenon is that there is a constant current (created from a flow of positively charged ions toward these hair cells).  So there is always some current, and it is modulated up or down with head movements.  This is how the brain determined that the head is moving.  \n\nhttps://scienceisbeauty.tumblr.com/post/49201644148/anatomy-of-vestibular-apparatus-source-chapter\n\nImportant point #2 is that these organs are bathed in an ion rich fluid.  So you have a constant current flowing through an ion rich fluid.  When you introduce this into a magnetic field, you will get a force IN the fluid.  This is called a Lorentz force and is an expected finding from magnetohydrodynamics.  \n\nHere's a great example of this happening in a dish, on youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVlDzbIU5Y\n\nThe final necessary component is having the internal machinery to detect this force, generating the eye movements.  The kinds of eye movements you see in this video indicate that one particular part of the inner ear is being affected (horizontal semicircular canal).  Others may be involved as well, but it's a subtle point.  In order for these eye movements to occur, you have to have a force in the fluid strong enough to displace the sensory organ.  We've done some calculations, and others have done more formal modeling to show the forces in an MRI of at least 1.5 T are sufficient to displace the sensor and cause nystagmus.  \n\nA Lorentz force is a cross-product.  The formula for a Lorentz force is F=IxB, Lorentz force = current * (scaling factor: distance over which the current flows) crossed with the magnetic field intensity.  So the intensity of the current and magnetic field scales linearly.  That means the force scales linearly with the strength of the field.  Stronger the MRI, more likely you are to get dizzy.  Current and magnetic field are also vectors, which means the orientation of the vectors with respect to each other impacts the orientation and strength of the resultant force.  In an MRI, the magnetic field vector is always the same.   So if one were to align the current and magnetic field vectors, there would be no nystagmus and you can change the direction of the eye movements by pitching your head through the null position!  \n\nThe end result of all of this though is that you have a constant deflection of the sensory organ that is an angular accelerometer.  There are no long term consequences of this that we can tell, but it is equivalent to constantly, but slowly accelerating someone the entire time they are in a strong MRI.

Dennis vanEngelsdorp called Lu\u2019s first study \u201can embarrassment\u201d while Scott Black, executive director of the bee-hugging Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, characterized it as fatally flawed, both in its design and conclusions.\n\nUniversity of Illinois entomologist May Berenbaum, who chaired the National Academy of Sciences 2007 National Research council study on the Status of Pollinators in North America called it \u201ceffectively worthless\u201d to serious researchers. \u201cThe experimental design and statistical analysis are just not reliable,\u201d she said.\"\n\nhttp://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/6323626"], [155, "Entomologist here.

Those criticisms linked above include:\n\n* Essentially pumping the bees with much higher than realistic concentrations of neonicotinoids for much longer than they would be exposed to any amount in the field (and actually finding those bees live surprising long when you did that). \n* Extremely low sample size.\n* Not accounting for confounding factors like disease that we do know affect honeybee populations.\n* Having a smoking gun conclusion that would have no problem getting into a high tier journal like Nature if it were sound, but instead publishing in an obscure pay-to-play journal after being correctly rejected by Nature.\n* Poisoning your colonies and calling it CCD when the symptoms didn't even match the criteria for CCD.\n\nTalking to entomologists in the field, a few regard this study as such a poor design that it appears to be fishing for the result you got (followed by incorrect interpretations), but most seem to think this just looks like a case of inexperience from someone not familiar with the field of entomology. I was actually surprised about this study when I saw how many big names in the field of honey bee health (independent university researchers) called out the major issues with this study.\n\nTo the actual question, why do you continue pushing this study as if it is accepted by the scientific community, and do you have any plans to implement a properly designed study if you are still convinced that your hypothesis is true? You've been repeatedly shown the many fatal flaws in your study design, so I'm surprised you haven't done a corrected follow-up study yet if that is the case.\n\n\n**2.** You have a serious conflict of interest being on the board of The Organic Center, which is affiliated with the Organic Trade Association.

Farmers have a pretty short window to plant as it is and didn't consider it to be the same as spraying. Also why there was such discrepancy with die off with pre made coatings vs ones applied at the field.\n\nPMRA, the Canadian agency that regulates pesticide use,[ spearheaded a huge rework](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/pubs/pest/_fact-fiche/pollinator-protection-pollinisateurs/index-eng.php) of the seed coating with farmer, beekeeper and Bayer as stakeholders.

Dancing around the criticisms is also beginning to appear very strange too.\n\n>Our study design is so straight forward that anybody could replicate it. \n\nHonestly, this sounds like hyperbole that would result in a near automatic rejection if I were peer-reviewing a paper. Simple but poorly designed still means the results and interpretations are still invalid. Simple is not an excuse for ignoring the very basic flaws that many entomologists pointed out shortly after your publications. It's not that often that we call out flawed studies to this degree.\n\n>In terms of statistical analysis, we did not use any fancy analyses in the studies.\n\nThis should be a red flag for anyone familiar with the importance of statistics. Accounting for confounding variables, failing to account for multiple comparisons, etc. is not fancy statistics, that's just failing to do extremely basic analyses expected of even low-tier papers such as yours. Looking at your 2012 paper, there's no indication you presented any results with appropriate statistical tests aside from saying sealed brood number decreased from July to September across treatments. This again, would be grounds for automatic rejection in nearly any reputable journal. Had you not dismissed these factors, actually collaborated with actual entomologists, *and* still found these results, then you likely would not have had this paper rejected from Nature. There's a very strong reason why the rejection occurred and you were forced to try publishing in a journal with the odd term \"Insectology\" in the title that most of us entomologists had never heard of before.\n\n> The highest dose used in 2012 study was 400 ug/kg, that represented 400ug of neonics in a kg of HFCS that we fed to one hive for a week.

This dose exceeded what we have measured in pollen that we collected in the 2015 study.\n\nYes, and that is why these studies have been rejected by the scientific community. The 2014 study even with the smaller concentration amounts to an amount 100 times larger than you'd expect to find in pollen from treated plants. Far from field realistic levels. Even Bayer has no trouble admitting that because [concentrations shouldn't be over even 50 ppb](http://scientificbeekeeping.com/news-and-blogs-page/) even if someone completely messed up the application.\n\n>Besides the criticisms, they never mentioned the use of control hives\n\nThis seems like another odd response. Of course you are going to see differences compared to a control if you give your bees unrealistic concentrations of insecticide.\n\n>I guess that is because the control hives all survived along with those dead CCD hives. \n\nYou never indicated your hives even had CCD in the first place. Calling them CCD hives does not magically make them so. This appears to be another case of you not being familiar with the entomological literature. Earlier in this AMA, you [disparaged Dr. vanEngelsdorp](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5fbfa6/science_ama_series_hi_reddit_im_alex_lu_associate/daj4slv/?context=3) for being one of the main critics of your poorly designed studies. You may not be aware, but that was the researcher who first coined the term colony collapse disorder and is generally regarded as the primary expert on CCD. If you had read [the literature](https://articles.extension.org/sites/default/files/w/a/ad/ASurveyofManagedHoneyBeeColonyLossesintheUSAFall2009toWinter2010.pdf) on this subject, you would know that what you mistakenly call CCD is exactly what is repeatedly [warned against by other researchers](http://www.syngenta.ca/docs/Smith_etal_EcoHealth_Alliance_publication_on_HB_Health.pdf).\n\nYour hives had the appearance of abandonment due to disease or normal colony death over winter, not CCD symptoms. They lacked the sealed brood typical of CCD among other symptoms. Simply making your bees go missing (presumably by giving them more insecticide than they would ever encounter) is not CCD.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's very clear that you are trying to say you have the smoking gun when all of the other literature directly contradicts this unfounded claim by saying there isn't one single cause, and that the best evidence shows a mixture of stressors together being the cause with [pest and pathogens](http://www.syngenta.ca/docs/Smith_etal_EcoHealth_Alliance_publication_on_HB_Health.pdf) being those with the strongest supporting evidence.", "id": "dajla2k"}, {"comment": "I'm a scientist studying honey bee health - specifically relating to the survival (or not) of honey bees infested with the parasitic Varroa mite and the viruses the mite's bite transmits.

I think the linked article makes one or two overly critical hyberbolic claims itself, but I think it's worthwhile to both hear what Dr. Lu has to say as well as hear criticisms that have been leveled against the papers he's published so far.\n\nThat being said, it's critical that neonicitinoid pesticides are being investigated.  Honey bees are essential to many food production systems, and we need to understand why colonies are dying more frequently and are more often sickly than they had been in the past.  You may have heard that \"the number of bee colonies has been going up in recent years\" but that's misleading.  Commercial beekeepers have more colonies than ever because they're constantly splitting big colonies into new smaller ones to try to boost their numbers going into winter so that enough colonies survive for the next year.  It used to be that commercial beekeepers just didn't need to force that much reproduction, because colonies were living many years longer without any extraordinary assistance from the beekeeper.

Those criticisms linked above include:\n\n* Essentially pumping the bees with much higher than realistic concentrations of neonicotinoids for much longer than they would be exposed to any amount in the field (and actually finding those bees live surprising long when you did that). \n* Extremely low sample size.\n* Not accounting for confounding factors like disease that we do know affect honeybee populations.\n* Having a smoking gun conclusion that would have no problem getting into a high tier journal like Nature if it were sound, but instead publishing in an obscure pay-to-play journal after being correctly rejected by Nature.\n* Poisoning your colonies and calling it CCD when the symptoms didn't even match the criteria for CCD.\n\nTalking to entomologists in the field, a few regard this study as such a poor design that it appears to be fishing for the result you got (followed by incorrect interpretations), but most seem to think this just looks like a case of inexperience from someone not familiar with the field of entomology. I was actually surprised about this study when I saw how many big names in the field of honey bee health (independent university researchers) called out the major issues with this study.\n\nTo the actual question, why do you continue pushing this study as if it is accepted by the scientific community, and do you have any plans to implement a properly designed study if you are still convinced that your hypothesis is true? You've been repeatedly shown the many fatal flaws in your study design, so I'm surprised you haven't done a corrected follow-up study yet if that is the case.\n\n\n**2.** You have a serious conflict of interest being on the board of The Organic Center, which is affiliated with the Organic Trade Association.

Also why there was such discrepancy with die off with pre made coatings vs ones applied at the field.\n\nPMRA, the Canadian agency that regulates pesticide use,[ spearheaded a huge rework](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/pubs/pest/_fact-fiche/pollinator-protection-pollinisateurs/index-eng.php) of the seed coating with farmer, beekeeper and Bayer as stakeholders.

In the theory, c is the conversion term that changes a unit of space into a unit of time, and that is also taken as being also the speed of light. As a conversion unit, it is necessarily independent of the observer and of the source of what is observed. (The speed of light in a vacuum is given independently, by the permeability and permittivity of free space. Those are also observer-independent.) \n\nA point mass generates a field that, in theory, extends throughout the universe (but of course merges with and becomes indistinguishable from the fields generated by other masses at a distance.) A massive body will sense this as a constant background. By contrast, if a body accelerates with respect to that universal field, this information will have to propagate through the field before other bodies sense it. How fast it does that is the speed of gravity. \n\nThere is no theoretical requirement in special or general relativity that this propagation, the speed of gravity, should occur at c, at the speed of light. However, measurements of binary pulsars, and of Jupiter's occultation of a quasar, both put the speed of gravity as being very close to that of light; in the case of the pulsars, within 1% of it. \n\nThat is, in a sense, quite surprising, as neither the permittivity nor permeability of free space should have anything to do with gravity, being purely electromagnetic phenomena, whilst gravity has spacetime itself as its field. Whether that is quantised into gravitons is anyone's guess: if so, the spin 2 graviton might in fact be a four x half spin particle, each spin gauging one dimension odf space time and the angle between these giving the two gravity tensors. Might. Maybe.\n\nMassless particles are required to travel at the speed of light (and to experience no time flow by virtue of this.) If gravitons exist, they must therefore be massless today if they are to travel, today, at the speed of light. However, might they have acquired mass when the universe was young, dense and highly curved - that is, then they were (may have been!) highly 'doubled' up themselves? Perhaps.

So, we can measure them to look at how things like light behaved in the early universe.\n\nELI15: Obviously, we can't go to the past, fire a laser, and measure its speed.

In the theory, c is the conversion term that changes a unit of space into a unit of time, and that is also taken as being also the speed of light. As a conversion unit, it is necessarily independent of the observer and of the source of what is observed. (The speed of light in a vacuum is given independently, by the permeability and permittivity of free space. Those are also observer-independent.) \n\nA point mass generates a field that, in theory, extends throughout the universe (but of course merges with and becomes indistinguishable from the fields generated by other masses at a distance.) A massive body will sense this as a constant background. By contrast, if a body accelerates with respect to that universal field, this information will have to propagate through the field before other bodies sense it. How fast it does that is the speed of gravity. \n\nThere is no theoretical requirement in special or general relativity that this propagation, the speed of gravity, should occur at c, at the speed of light. However, measurements of binary pulsars, and of Jupiter's occultation of a quasar, both put the speed of gravity as being very close to that of light; in the case of the pulsars, within 1% of it. \n\nThat is, in a sense, quite surprising, as neither the permittivity nor permeability of free space should have anything to do with gravity, being purely electromagnetic phenomena, whilst gravity has spacetime itself as its field. Whether that is quantised into gravitons is anyone's guess: if so, the spin 2 graviton might in fact be a four x half spin particle, each spin gauging one dimension odf space time and the angle between these giving the two gravity tensors. Might. Maybe.\n\nMassless particles are required to travel at the speed of light (and to experience no time flow by virtue of this.) If gravitons exist, they must therefore be massless today if they are to travel, today, at the speed of light. However, might they have acquired mass when the universe was young, dense and highly curved - that is, then they were (may have been!) highly 'doubled' up themselves? Perhaps.

The way to reduce creep is to go single crystal.\n\nBetween separate crystals there exists what's called a grain boundary, essentially the contact surface between two non-aligned crystals. Grain boundaries can hold a lot of energy. What this means is that when a crack is formed through normal means, once it hits a grain boundary it can stop. It may resume or change direction, but the boundaries impede the process. Without any grain boundaries, such as in single crystal, cracks propagate quickly, leading to catastrophic failure.\n\nGrain boundaries also make the object more ductile (allowing it to deform rather than break). Grain boundaries are able to \"slip\" easier than the insides of a crystal lattice. This allows the material to store deformation energy in the grain boundaries instead of that energy going to break the crystalline structure. \n\nPretty much, single crystal is great at creep because there's no grain boundaries to slip.

It's then about teaching the client more productive coping strategies.\n\nMindfulness Therapy is a more recent endeavour by Positive health Psychologists and the the research to back it up that I have seen is somewhat dubious. It was developed off the back off CBT and only involves the Cognition component.

So it was never really adopted in the western world.\n\nA recent school in Psychology erupted in the 80's and 90's known as Positive Psychology and focused more on subjective states of arousal and subjective happiness and well-being, a backlash to Psychology's tunnel vision for pathologies and what defined a disorder.

Niche breadth refers to the size of the niche a species occupies.  With respect to generalist/specialist species, this usually refers to a resource-based niche, but it can also have an environmental perspective.  Niche breadths can be very wide or very small with respect to other species.  A species with a wide niche breadth is able to utilize many types of resources in many different ways and is therefore labeled a \"generalist\".  On the other hand, a species with a very narrow niche breadth and utilizes only a small range of resources and in very specific ways is called a \"specialist\".\n\nIt is well documented that evolution occurs faster in specialist species than it does in generalists.  [Whitlock](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2463048?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) provides a good theoretical review on why this is the case but in short specialists evolve faster than generalists because 1) the traits they evolved provide better fitness than traits evolved by generalists, 2) specialist traits tend to evolve in relatively predictable environments, and therefore less traits are needed to maximize  fitness whereas generalists need to evolve more traits, each adaptable to different environments, 3) specialists tend to express behaviors and traits that are specific to the narrow types of resources they are consuming, the environment they live in, and also minimize the competition with as many similar species as possible, whereas a generalist must necessarily face greater competition.  \n\nGeneralist species tend to have broader distributions than specialists.  Consequently, the more specialized the species, the narrower the niche breadth, and also the narrower the range.  This is related to [Rapaport's rule](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20120824).  When a species is overspecialized it is referring to a species that is so finely adapted to a specific range of conditions that it cannot tolerate any environmental or resource perturbations.  For example, hydrothermal vent species cannot survive in cold water because not only does the temperature provide an extreme physiological stressor, but resources are also much scarcer in the different environment.  If it somehow survives the temperature shock, it'll still starve because no other environment provides the nutrition the thermal vent has.  \n\nSo, in short, a specialist is a species with a small niche breadth, a generalist has a big niche breadth.  Niche modelling programs with resource-species matrices, coupled with phylogenetic information can help elucidate where species fall on the specialist/generalist spectrum.", "id": "damwpnu"}, {"comment": "Very thorough response, thank you!

The process that is going on is the same in viruses as it is in bacteria, in the same way that it's the same process going on in bacteria as it is in humans. You may not consider viruses 'living', but you have to admit they're more like a lot of 'living matter' than they are like most 'non-living matter'.\n\nThe whole \"are viruses alive\" debate is not really a scientifically interesting or useful one. What would change if we considered them alive instead of whatever we consider them now? Nothing would change, because 'living thing' is pretty much just a name. This whole \"viruses are not alive\" thing just complicates the discussion of viruses by bogging it down in technicalities. Although the \"are viruses alive\" question may be a serious one for philosophers, it is not a serious question for virologists.\n\nI'm sure you could follow Wikipedia links and find justification for viruses as non-living things and also for evolution being unique to living things (I just did this and found that on a purely semantic level, this is arguable). But that's such a meaningless technicality, and all serious scientific investigation and discussion uses the term 'evolution'. \n\nSo what should they call it, if not evolution?

I still think evolution is a perfectly good term because that doesn't strictly require 'life' to apply. Cars have evolved over time.

Is life defined chemically, or qualitatively? Are viruses some sort of chemical oddity which just happens to perform this interesting reproductive process? In those terms how different are we and them? ", "id": "danbwb4"}], [{"comment": "But...\n\nViruses dont sexually reproduce. So there aren't actual species, just continuous branching.", "id": "damtcvs"}, {"comment": "Neither do bacteria. Should they not be considered species? \n\nI know you're using the definition of species in which organisms are in the same species if they are capable of sexually reproducing to create fertile offspring - so in that sense, you're right. \n\nBut when talking about viruses, the definition is slightly different (broader, I'd say): [\"A species is a monophyletic group of viruses whose properties can be distinguished from those of other species by multiple criteria\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus_classification#Virus_species_definition) (they also say \"a polythetic class of viruses that constitutes a replicating lineage and occupies a particular ecological niche\", which I think is also nice).\n\nI would argue that the term \"species\" referring to ability to interbreed is a much more limiting term than the term species used for viruses. Conceptually, you can't apply the first definition to anything that doesn't reproduce sexually, and that excludes a fair number of things that might be better included. \n\nHowever, in the virus definition, all you have to do is replace the word \"viruses\" with your thing of choice, and it'll work. (Of course, virus taxonomy pays a price for this looser definition in that it's definitely not as cut-and-dry to classify anything according to these fairly vague criteria, but it does allow for wiggle room).\n\nI think it is justified to use \"species\" to refer to groups of similar viruses just as we would to groups of similar animals/plants because their similarities are at the level of the same substrate - RNA and the processes related to it.\n\nI actually think the virus definition of species is more scientific than the interbreeding definition. Is a sterile human a different species from the non-sterile ones? If a man and woman have only one child and the child grows up to be sterile, are the parents from separate species? How can you prove/disprove that two people/organisms are from the same species, without them having fertile offspring?\n\nThe Wiki page for [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) goes well into the difficulties with the term.\n\nAnyway, this is all an issue about how we talk about these things. It's just naming conventions and semantics. You could start a petition to pick a different word, but that would be a lot more work than it's worth\n\nAlso, 'fun' fact, [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) (the father of modern taxonomy) also participated in a historical trend in medicine wherein people tried to classify diseases taxonomically according to their symptoms - Linnaeus contributed his [*Genera Morborum*](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004894125.0001.000/1:3.4?rgn=div2;view=fulltext). In this situation, I would consider it wrong to use the term \"species\" in the same way as the authors of this paper are - the similarities in the diseases are due to limitations in disease presentation by the way the human body is, not so much by similarities in the causes of the disease (of course, they can be forgiven for being pre-germ theory).\n\n", "id": "dan2kmi"}, {"comment": "Yeah, you just have to use other definitions other than the biological species concept.", "id": "danamee"}, {"comment": "This is kind of what I was thinking...

The group differences reached statistical significance for all four regions, specifically, left BA 44 (F1,97 = 8.47, n = 100, P = 0.0045), right BA 44 (F1,97 = 7.14, n = 100, P = 0.0088), left BA 45 (F1,97 = 8.54, n = 100, P = 0.0043), and right BA 45 (F1,97 = 6.91, n = 100, P = 0.0100). Figure 3 depicts the median, quartiles, and 1.5 interquartile ranges for every region and each hemisphere. In terms of hemispheric differences, we observed a leftward asymmetry (especially for BA 44) as expected (because of the inherent asymmetric nature of the applied cytoarchitectonic maps; see Amunts et al., 1999). Interestingly, there were no significant sex differences with respect to the magnitude of this left-hemispheric asymmetry either for BA 44 (F1,97 = 0.01, n = 100, P = 0.9264) or for BA 45 (F1,97 < 0.01, n = 100, P = 0.9690).\n\nTable 1 reproduced below (volume in milliliters, in mean\u00b1SD format), n=50 in both men and women:\n\nMen BA 44 left| Men BA 45 left | Women BA 44 left | Women BA 45 left\n---|---|----|----\n4.52 \u00b1 0.79 | 3.46 \u00b1 0.61 | 4.68 \u00b1 0.71 | 3.64 \u00b1 0.61\n\nMen BA 44 right| Men BA 45 right| Women BA 44 right | Women BA 45 right\n---|---|----|----\n2.82 \u00b1 0.52 | 3.25 \u00b1 0.66 | 2.93 \u00b1 0.49 | 3.43 \u00b1 0.61\n\nFrom data analysis (emphasis added):\n\n> By multiplying the voxelwise gray matter content with the voxel volume (see previous section) and then adding up the resulting voxel-specific volumes, we calculated the probability-weighted gray matter volumes for BA 44 and BA 45 in each hemisphere. Note that these volumes are already corrected for interindividual differences in brain size given the aforementioned modulation of the gray matter segments. The resulting gray matter volumes were statistically compared between men and women, while removing the variance associated with age. As a safeguard against type I error, Bonferroni corrections were applied to account for the four dependent variables (left BA 44, right BA 44, left BA 45, right BA 45) using a threshold of P \u2264 0.0125 (P \u2264 0.05/4).\n\n> To examine possible sex differences in gray matter asymmetry, the asymmetry index (AI) was calculated as (left \u2013 right)/[0.5 x (left + right)] from the volumes of BA 44 and BA 45, as described in previous publications (Amunts et al., 1999; Luders et al., 2004; Kurth et al., 2015b, 2015d). For analysis of asymmetry differences, it is important to keep in mind that all resulting left- and right-hemispheric volumes are heavily influenced by the size of their ROIs (the larger the ROI, the more voxels are included and weighted). Notably, the original cytoarchitectonic probability maps of BA 44 and BA 45 (i.e., the basis for our ROIs) are inherently asymmetric, with larger dimensions on the left than the right (Amunts et al., 1999). As such they largely drive the degree of asymmetry for BA 44 and BA 45 when analyzing gray matter volumes. Thus, in the current study, testing for significant asymmetry per se would yield outcomes without true scientific value. In contrast, testing for sex differences in asymmetry yields valid findings because any bias induced by the inherent asymmetric (left > right) nature of the ROIs applies to males and females alike. The resulting AIs for BA 44 and BA 45 were statistically compared between men and women, while removing the variance associated with age. Again, as a safeguard against type I error, Bonferroni corrections were applied to account for the two dependent variables (AI BA 44, AI BA 45) using a threshold of P \u2264 0.025 (P \u2264 0.05/2).\n\n> All statistical analyses pertaining to sex differences in BA 44/45 gray matter volumes as well as to sex differences in BA 44/45 gray matter asymmetry were conducted using a general linear model in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA). **Moreover, for all analyses, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and Lilliefors tests were applied to ensure that assumptions required for parametric testing (normal distribution and identical distribution of the residuals) were not violated.**\n\nUnfortunately, they do not provide complete/raw data. However, based on the fact that they did perform tests to ensure that parametric analysis would be appropriate, I think it is safe to assume that there were no strong violations to normality and i.i.d. in the data, which would mean that there wouldn't be an excess of outliers in either group.", "id": "danp19i"}], [{"comment": "Interesting, technically, but not very informative biologically....

Furthermore, we show that the nodular and digitate silica structures at El Tatio that most closely resemble those on Mars include complex sedimentary structures produced by a combination of biotic and abiotic processes.

Dudes on Mars dirt bikes with buckets and trowels could collect and process more raw science than a 1000 rovers ever could in a single year.\n\nRed Dragon gets us closer to that, sky cranes are a distraction. Though methane powered, reusable ones on the other hand would be a great idea. Instead of sending any rover at all next time NASA just sends a kick ass skycrane delivering rolling rovers anywhere on mars before hopping back for a refill. Then the rovers don't even need to carry their own equipment. Hell you could keep hopping them and just carry back their hopper loads.\n\nOkay I really like the sky-crane idea again, more sky-cranes!

Furthermore, we show that the nodular and digitate silica structures at El Tatio that most closely resemble those on Mars include complex sedimentary structures produced by a combination of biotic and abiotic processes.

Using the [NCVS Victimization Analysis Tool](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=nvat) I queried Rape/Sexual assault by sex for 2010-2015. (Select \"Custom Tables\" -> \"Personal Victimization\")\n\nSure enough, in 2012 there were 131,259 male victims of sexual assault out of a total of 346,830. Or 37.8%, just as reported.\n\nBut that's not just higher than prior surveys, it's an extreme outlier: \n\n* In 2010 there were 15,020 male victims (6%)\n* In 2011 there were 34,804 male victims (14%)\n* In 2013 there were 34,057 (11%)\n* In 2014 there were 28,032 (10%)\n* In 2015 there were 62,916 (15%)\n\nThe tool notes for several years: \"Interpret data with caution, based on 10 or fewer sample cases or the coefficient of variation is greater than 50%.\"\n\nFrom the methodology page:\n\n*BJS selects a sample from the entire population to use for the NCVS. BJS could have chosen from a large number of other possible samples of equal size that could have been obtained by using the same sample design and selection procedures. The estimates derived from any one of these samples would differ from one another due to sampling variability, or sampling error. Sampling error is often quantified with the standard error as described below.*\n\nIt appears these numbers are estimates for the general population based on extrapolation from a small (possibly very small) sample, in which case the 38% statistic may be extremely misleading.\n\nAnyone with a better understanding should feel free to weigh in or correct me."], [373, "This is worth noting:\n\n> \u201ca 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators. *The authors defined sexual coercion broadly, including verbal pressure such as nagging and begging,* which, the authors acknowledge, increases prevalence dramatically.\u201d\n\nWhether or not 'nagging and begging' qualify as predation is for the individual reader to decide.  I'd be inclined to disagree.\n\nThe other main realm discussed was sex with the incarcerated, where the number of male victims was increased by the far higher male incarceration rate:\n\n> Among adults who reported sexual contact with prison staff, including some contact that prisoners call \u201cwilling\u201d but that is often coercive and always illegal, 80 percent reported only female perpetrators. Among juveniles, the same figure is 89.3 percent.

Is it a (presumably unofficial) requirement to placate the feelings of the \"women's rights agenda\" to do research, or just a priority?  I would think that research would be judged on the merits of its findings, not what effect it might have on victimization narratives.  If that's not the case, then what does that say about the \"women's rights agenda's\" stifling impact on research?

The article linked provides a decent summary of the paper's findings, so I'd recommend people read that if they're interested in more information about the paper than is included in the headline.\n\nThe paper itself is quite lengthy, as the researchers are careful to provide the much necessary context to understand their research within. One of the things they note is that the idea that women cannot be sexual predators is borne out of sexism and misogyny in general, from the notion that women are submissive, meek, and weak. The issue explored in this research (sexual predators being underestimated to grave cost of their victims) is a perfect example of the harms to *both men and women* that sexism, and more specifically misogyny, can cause. Specifically, the researchers state:\n\n>Stereotypes about women, which reflect gender and heterosexist biases, include the notion that women are nurturing, submissive helpmates to men. The idea that women can be sexually manipulative, dominant, and even violent runs counter to these stereotypes (Byers, 1996 and Pflugradt and Allen, 2012).\n\nAnother thing to note is that this research does not in any way run counter to feminism, feminist perspectives, or feminist causes. The researchers also note this, stating in their conclusion:\n\n>In light of this new federal agency data demonstrating that female sexual perpetration is more widespread than previously known, we have sought to enumerate the gender stereotypes fueling its neglect. We call for feminist approaches \u2013 expansively interpreted \u2013 to challenge these stereotypes, making room to consider women who are abusive, power seeking, and sexually aggressive, while taking into account the troubled background many such women possess.\n\n>Unless we uproot the simplistic stereotypes that limit understandings about sexual victimization, we will not address it accurately, nor will we respond to victims empathically. Those victimized by women are doubly harmed when we fail to treat their abuse as worthy of concern.\n\nThis research is crucial in expanding our understanding of sex crimes and victims, making it even more important that this not spark a \"gender war\" debate.

The article linked provides a decent summary of the paper's findings, so I'd recommend people read that if they're interested in more information about the paper than is included in the headline.\n\nThe paper itself is quite lengthy, as the researchers are careful to provide the much necessary context to understand their research within. One of the things they note is that the idea that women cannot be sexual predators is borne out of sexism and misogyny in general, from the notion that women are submissive, meek, and weak. The issue explored in this research (sexual predators being underestimated to grave cost of their victims) is a perfect example of the harms to *both men and women* that sexism, and more specifically misogyny, can cause. Specifically, the researchers state:\n\n>Stereotypes about women, which reflect gender and heterosexist biases, include the notion that women are nurturing, submissive helpmates to men. The idea that women can be sexually manipulative, dominant, and even violent runs counter to these stereotypes (Byers, 1996 and Pflugradt and Allen, 2012).\n\nAnother thing to note is that this research does not in any way run counter to feminism, feminist perspectives, or feminist causes. The researchers also note this, stating in their conclusion:\n\n>In light of this new federal agency data demonstrating that female sexual perpetration is more widespread than previously known, we have sought to enumerate the gender stereotypes fueling its neglect. We call for feminist approaches \u2013 expansively interpreted \u2013 to challenge these stereotypes, making room to consider women who are abusive, power seeking, and sexually aggressive, while taking into account the troubled background many such women possess.\n\n>Unless we uproot the simplistic stereotypes that limit understandings about sexual victimization, we will not address it accurately, nor will we respond to victims empathically. Those victimized by women are doubly harmed when we fail to treat their abuse as worthy of concern.\n\nThis research is crucial in expanding our understanding of sex crimes and victims, making it even more important that this not spark a \"gender war\" debate.

The evidence for such a claim must be extraordinary, which is why you use math and the universe as analogies because while they are lofty fields of study, the evidence for them *are* extraordinary.\n\nYet again, a way to sneak in \"undefinable or unknowable\" things into existence by claiming our lack of \"total\" knowledge about math and space.\n\n>Nevertheless, it is absurd and a non sequitur to think that our limited comprehension nullifies its possible existence.\n\nThis is why you misunderstand my argument.  I'm not making the claim a god doesn't exist. Others are making the claim that one does.  \n\nHumanity's limited comprehension speaks better of the idea of using a bottom up, evidence-based approach to understanding our existence, instead of falling back on the tired argument of \"we don't know everything, so who's to say my hypothetical *isn't* true?\"\n\nHypotheticals gain currency in the way of meaningful conversation by piling on evidence.

If not, what is your opinion of the possible effects CRISPR could have?\nLink: https://youtu.be/jAhjPd4uNFY", "id": "dakhsgg"}, {"comment": "I'm not the scientist you're asking, but I work with genetics, and have colleagues that are working with CRISPR. In fact, I know one of the people currently waging the patent fight over the CRISPR-CAS9 system.\n\nThe video is correct as far as the theory, but I'm hesitant to call CRISPR a magic bullet. For example, the video mentions that 3,000 diseases are caused by a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (or SNP). This is true, but a large number of these diseases are relatively rare. As any Medical Student could tell you, there's piles of genetic diseases with maybe a few cases a year, if that.\n\nThe real issue comes with the nature of genetic architecture. There are two big camps in genetics. Those who believe that a few genes of major effect (Major genes, or Mendelian genes, in that they look like one of the classic punnett squares when you examine the offspring) are the predominant driver of physical architecture, and then those who believe that Mendelian genes are relatively rare and that much of physical architecture is determined by many many small effect genes (This is the qualitative camp).\n\nI'm a breeder who works primarily on things like yield, so I lean to the quantitative side of things. But I've also worked on diseases, which are often Mendelian in nature. My gut feeling, for most traits, CRISPR will not work as a gene editing tool, as there are too many genes to edit to gain any functional progress. Even if it is fast and easy, one of the (I believe, large mistruths) of molecular biology over the last 10-15 years is that gene networks are functionally meaningful. That's not to say that they don't work, but that they've been vastly oversold as a way to seperate biological noise from function. We are many, many years away from gaining any functional understanding of how the genes of an organism leads to the phenotype in any but the simplest of mendelian traits.\n\nThere are however, things that CRISPR will be good for. Mapping is one. By being able to target mutations at particular sites, we can knockout candidate genes to validate their function. This again, only works above a certain threshold, but it's a particularly handy tool.\n\nIn addition to all these caveats, there is one BIG issue.\n\nRegulation.\n\nThe primary cost (for example, using my own field of agriculture) is not the actual process, but the regulation surrounding the transformation event. Take Corn for example, where the cost of deregulation is something along the lines of a quarter of a billion dollars. The primary time sink and cost driver here is not the process itself (which takes a little over a year and I've heard quotes of about 1 million dollars to find a gene insertion that matches what the company's specifications are, but take this with a grain of salt. The cost is substantial, but dwarfed by regulatory tests) but actually proving safety and non-harm.\n\nThis regulatory framework has meant that only modifications that are huge and significant are ever brought to market. Taken into a medical setting, imagine spending a large chunk of change (in the 10's or 100's of millions of dollars) on a modification that saves 10-100 people a year. \n\nCRISPR is a large advancement, but ignores that the main cost driver is regulatory, and that many traits of interest are actually quantitative, not Mendelian.", "id": "dakoqr2"}, {"comment": "I imagine there are some countries where that regulation is more lax and that this is where we'll see the rapid developments.

However, when it comes to finding anything other than a smattering of easy modifying targets, old school quantitative selection is where it's at.\n\n>As an example, take Invigor from Bayer.

Things like Invigor, Roundup Ready, Bt, and DroughtGard do exist, and are important. For every Mutation in an upstream TF, however, there are a hundred genes that also have some immeasurable but substantially additive effect (cumulatively).

What we learned from this competition teaches us about long-term strategies to control cell migration, which could ultimately have medical applications.  For example, in measuring neutrophils from patients with sepsis, we find that these neutrophils are moving significantly slower and are less accurate at moving towards targets (e.g. microbes).  If we had a way to correct these deficiencies, we could have better medicines for treating patients with sepsis.  Right now there is no medicine of this kind.

The fundamental idea is that by controlling cell migration we could control inflammation.  This could work because most of the cells participating in inflammation aka white blood cells reside in the blood most of the time, and move into the tissues only when an inflammation trigger is turned on.  Thus, reducing the number of cells, e.g. neutrophils, from entering a tissue could have an impact on inflammation.  The most important thing for this strategy to work in practice is that the control has to be very precise.

There have been a number of conflicting studies with respect to the efficacy of prostate cancer screening using PSA on a population-basis; meaning should we test every man with PSA. There were two very large studies, one in the U.S. called the PLCO and another in Europe called the ERSPC, that were designed to see whether screening or lack of screening resulted in reducing deaths from prostate cancer. \n\nThe American study, was flawed as many men in the non-screening group received PSA tests. That study did not show an advantage to PSA screening. The European study, which had 180,000 men enrolled, is now the largest PSA screening study to date and has followed men for over 13 years. This study demonstrated that PSA screening will lead to early detection and a reduction in prostate cancer deaths. The study showed that screening benefit men under the age of 60 the most. \n\nThe take home message I would give when it comes to PSA screening, is that a man should have a conversation with his physician about the risks and benefits of having PSA blood test.

We would only treat this condition if it results in infections beneath the foreskin or in the urinary tract, or if it interferes with sexual function such as causing pain with erections. Some topical creams that contain a steroid can loosen the tight ring of skin though the success rate for this is relatively low.

Prior to the era of PSA testing, most men would present with advanced forms of prostate cancer and rates of death directly as a result of prostate cancer were much higher than they are today.

The general consensus amongst the urologic community is that PSA testing remains a valuable tool to identify men at risk for prostate cancer. My belief is that if PSA is used wisely, and we don\u2019t over treat cancers that will cause no harm to men, such as Gleason 6 prostate cancer, then we should still use it until a better test becomes available. In terms of new and up and coming tests, we are currently offering the PCA 3 urine test as well as the 4K score, a type of blood test. \n\nIn terms of BPH, PSA is a good substitute for prostate size as well as response to treatment.

I was interviewed about this topic recently which you can read here: http://www.canadianliving.com/health/prevention-and-recovery/article/are-utis-more-common-in-the-summer-and-how-to-lower-your-risk\n\nSome women may have a urinary tract infection which clears but the symptoms persist as a result of the development of pelvic floor dysfunction. The muscles that surround tour bladder in the pelvis become hypertonic (too tight) and they result in the same symptoms as a UTI such as urinary frequency and urgency. The single best treatment that a person can seek if they have these symptoms in the absence of an infection is pelvic floor physiotherapy performed by an accredited physiotherapist. The last thing I would say is that doing Kegel exercises will only make this condition worse as you are tightening an already over tight pelvis. Many thanks for tuning in.

I will confine my answer to the general topic of nighttime peeing without getting into the specifics of your case - you should speak to your healthcare provider about your case. Nighttime urinating also called nocturia, can be a symptom of several possible underlying conditions. Men who have an enlarged prostate may not empty their bladder completely and as a result may be up throughout the night as the bladder fills up. Another possibility is that men can develop overactive bladders, which can result in nighttime urgency forcing them to wake up from their sleep with the strong urge to urinate. Another interesting condition is called nocturnal polyuria, which is the overproduction of urine at night. There are several causes of this including sleep apnea (respiratory interruptions while sleeping), congestive heart failure, diabetes, or prescription drug-related (side effects of any medications). Sometimes, a solution may be as simple as taking your diuretic in the morning, and elevating your legs in the evening to reabsorb the fluid in swollen ankles, and possibly use a CPAP (breathing machine) if you have sleep apnea.

There is a common link between ED and enlarged prostate and that may be metabolic syndrome and endothelial dysfunction.

The arteries going to the penis are some of the smallest in our body and are most likely to be affected (blocked) resulting in erectile dysfunction. Larger waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), have also been linked to having a larger prostate.

The only options for weight gain are that your intake calories exceed your burnt calories.\n\nWhen it comes to this stuff a lot of people tend to throw a lot of crap around \"enzymes\", \"metabolism\" and other phrases that imply a sort of black-box are very popular. But though there are some mysteries about weight gain, we know very clearly that the only way to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. That means there are only two things you can impact to affect weight gain: calorie burning or calorie eating. Technically you're right that absorbing follows from eating, but this type of thing is pretty easy to measure and there isn't a ton of stuff that impacts absorption.", "id": "dahmbxo"}, {"comment": "\"Enzyme\" might not be the right word.  But, how about this.  The one over the counter, FDA approved diet pill is \"Alli\".  Alli prevents the absorption of about 20% of fat consumed, and that fat is then pooped out, basically.  So, that is a substance that decreases the efficiency of the digestive system in a way that decreases the number of calories absorbed from calories consumed.  \n\nAnother, not healthy diet \"trick\"/ eating disorder is laxatives.  You can decrease absorption of calories by inducing diarrhea, basically. \n\nAlso, with vitamins, we know that sometimes certain things need to be consumed together to be absorbed.  Vitamin C helps your body absorb calcium. Vitamin A and Vitamin D interact in a way.  \n\nWe all poop out some calories, right?  Why is it crazy to think that certain substances would increase the absorption of calories by the body?  \"Calories in\" doesn't 100% mean \"calories absorbed by the body.\" \n\nWe also know that certain substances effect our \"energy levels.\"  Amphetamines are a very effective diet because they give you \"energy\" without calories in, and you burn calories without feeling the need to eat to replenish them.  Marijuana on the other hand is a great way to gain weight. Sometimes/ some strains it decreases \"energy levels\" and induces hunger/reduces nausea.  \n\nI think when people talk about \"enzymes\" and \"metabolism\" this is what they mean.  Not that the laws of thermodynamics are ignored.  Just that our nerves and brains effect our energy output and food intake, and they can be altered, and some things do appear to decrease absorption, so it seems possible other things could increase absorption.

Well controlled and have a quite high artificial sweetener intake. However the sweetener itself plays no havoc with my weight.  I'm as fit as one can be without crossing into the daily gym bit.  \n\nThis is of course anecdotal, although I'd wager a good bit that most T1Ds of normal weight and size have a similar one to tell.  \n\nFrom my own experience I can conclude two possibilities.\n\nFirst, it may simply be that as abdominal obesity increases people shift to artificial sweeteners but do not otherwise negate caloric intake leaving them as they are and with possible increases in calorie intake even if they allow cognitive dissonance to overtake their intent to reduce calories by increasing caloric intake but excusing it with their increased low carb/no carb sweetener usage.  \n\nA second possibility relates to how the body stores fat that does not apply to people like myself. Insulin is for all intents and purposes and functionality so, the mediator of FFA storage in adipose tissue. That is, insulin is what makes people fat.  Insulin is the key negotiator for LPL demethylization in adipocytes, which is the enzyme which transports fatty acids into the far cell.  Less insulin and more glucagon reverse this process activating HSL which is the enzyme responsible for transporting FFAs out of the far cells, aka the active manner in which we lose weight (the fatty acids that flood the blood stream are taken up by muscle which in this same process activate LPL in muscle for uptake for the purpose of metabolism) .  So for this I suspect it is full and well possible that. Artificial sweeteners may increase the insulin load and allowing for more fat storage without the presence of actual glucose.  Though the caveat here is I'd assume hypoglycemia would be seen quite often were this the case, though other factors may play in which negate that as well.  \n\nUltimately I think it is that they are bad at their dieting and artificial may have given then more excuses to eat more and they don't realize that they're not dieting properly.

A main focus of storing fat biologically in the first place is about saving calories for the rainy foodless days where you can then burn them to keep having energy to survive till you find more food, like animals in nature or animals like us.\n\nCalories-in/calories-out is real but it's not the 100% full accurate picture. Whether you burn fat you consume or store it on a daily basis is related to other nutritional inputs and eating amounts and intervals too. Thermodynamcs, yes, all true, energy in energy out, but the body is a more complicated machine than pure calorie count and it seems possible to me that low/no calorie sweeteners keep the body in a fat storing state and increasing appetite similar to what nutritional sugar addiction does.

Years lived in poverty across ages 11 to 18 years forecasted diminished left dentate gyrus (simple slope, \u221214.20; standard error, 5.22; P\u2009=\u2009.008) and CA3 (simple slope, \u22126.42; standard error, 2.42; P\u2009=\u2009.009) hippocampal subfields and left amygdalar (simple slope, \u221234.62; standard error, 12.74; P\u2009=\u2009.008) volumes among young adults in the control condition (mean [SD] time, 2.04 [1.88] years) but not among those who participated in the Strong African American Families program (mean [SD] time, 2.61 [1.77] years).\n\n>**Conclusions and Relevance**  In this study, we described how participation in a randomized clinical trial designed to enhance supportive parenting ameliorated the association of years lived in poverty with left dentate gyrus and CA3 hippocampal subfields and left amygdalar volumes. These findings are consistent with a possible role for supportive parenting and suggest a strategy for narrowing social disparities.", "id": "dajiv5y"}, {"comment": "I do love how they specifically looked for \"right-handed\" people.

I wrote a paper once where we were asked to critique the science of a published article. Mine was based on a study comparing differences in the perceived ability of men and women to CONTROL their attractiveness.\n\n  Basically, their research noted that women generally don't have to try as hard to BE attractive (pulling from previous studies, their attractiveness is seen to be based on youth, health, beauty, and brains) BUT, they feel LESS in control of these factors (i.e., if they are just not pretty, they FEEL there isn't much they can do about it.)\n\n   Men felt they SHOULD be able to control the factors that make them attractive (social status, earning power, physicality, education).  These were the MOST important factors, but BOTH sexes overestimated these factors and underestimated others (like personality for women, and kindness for men).  Prior research cited said that women have MORE control than they think, and men seem to have less. \n\n There was more to the paper, but one conclusion they reached was that FAILURE by men to control these factors (perhaps working your ass off and still not making a million bucks, etc....) was emotionally devastating to men, moreso than to women. Women who felt unattractive (obviously, hard on the self esteem for both sexes) felt cheated or unlucky, and did suffer emotionally.  Meanwhile, men blamed themselves deeply for being unattractive, and felt more frustration and self loathing, along with the sadness and loneliness.   \n\nAnyway, romance novels all start with the male love interest being Superman.  He's always rich, always a station up from the heroine, always somehow \"special\".  He's NEVER going to lose a job, or screw up, he can silence other men with a look, etc..  He's ALWAYS in control.......it's easy for some women to accept a submissive place in such a relationship because the hero is NEVER like your last boyfriend who was such a disappointment, not exciting or romantic, and had no ambition.   We men hate that guy, because he never has to try, never has to beg, etc.\n\nThe heroine is always a plain girl, and superficially average, but secretly amazing, and HE considers her special and beautiful.  They love him because he's amazing, but he sees her that way, too, because she is, and other men don't see it.\n\nSo, as you say, women may not mind a controlling or dominant partner......as long as he is exceptional.

Stigma around mental health issues is an obvious one, the idea that your actions are entirely tied to you, and that fate has little do with it is another (so the rich = smart and talented, poor = stupid and lazy).\n\nWe tend to see only the negatives of this view because the positives are so intrinsic to our society they've now been law for over 200 years, and principles for far longer.

If you input false data, you get false data out. \n\nHere's where the distinction happens. For a computer, for a machine, inputting true data and getting what we perceive as false data? That's a problem with the machine. If you put in 2+2 and your computer gives you 5, something is wrong with the computer, right? \n\nWith a human being, you put in true data and get a seemingly false answer, as long as we have vetted that person through higher education or some other means, we don't assume they're broken, we assume that there's something different happening here. Maybe the data was false, or maybe there's something we haven't discovered yet, some *new* truth. \n\nWe can do this because we do not view ourselves as machines, but these separate entities that might have buggy parts, but can show insight in ways that a machine cannot. We view ourselves as *above* the current truth, able to detach ourselves from that reality when it becomes necessary and create a new one. \n\nIf you want an example of the ways in which treating humans as machines, in the way we currently think of a computer or a robot or a 3D printer or a car, then just extend that thinking back to say, Galileo. What if, instead of being treated as someone who *may* have been correct, or thinking to himself that he *was* correct, Galileo said \"I am broken and must be fixed.\" \n\nThat is what we do to machines when they break, when they receive truth and return falsehood. We fix them, and in the process remove any potential insight they can give.

The eventual solution was basically to give tax breaks to employers who provide health care to full-time employees, penalties to those who don't.  The result was a socialized healthcare system that spread costs among the general population and was heavily subsidized by the government.\n\nFast-forward a few decades, and people are running under the assumption that health insurance is a \"free market\".  The reality is, without governmental intervention, people generally wouldn't buy health insurance, except maybe catastrophic coverage.  It'd be like buying renter's insurance-- yeah, some people do it, but a lot of people don't, and it only covers situations where things go horribly wrong.  You'd still have to pay for your own doctor visits.  You'd still pay for your own medications.\n\nOne of the big problems there is that the people most in need of medical care (the seriously ill, the disabled, and the elderly) often don't have the resources themselves to arrange it or pay for it.  The way their medical care gets paid for is by having a lot of young, healthy people paying for health insurance every month and not reaping the rewards.  The costs need to be socialized somehow.\n\nSo the government has been hiding the fact that we've had socialized, government subsidized medical care in this country for decades.  The costs are split up so that the American people won't notice and realize that we're already one of those socialist countries with a public medical system.  The money comes out of your pocket through:\n\n* Taxes paying for Medicare/Medicaid\n* Lost tax revenue through tax breaks for insurance\n* Having you pay money to a private company instead of calling it a \"tax\", even though you're being compelled to give money to pay for others' medical care either way\n* Providing medical care in hospitals to people who never pay for it, and offsetting the loss by charging more to those who have insurance\n\nSo it's already socialized medicine in disguise, it's just a fairly inefficient disguise.\n", "id": "dampzy8"}, {"comment": ">So it's already socialized medicine in disguise, it's just a fairly inefficient disguise.\n\nThat's exactly the problem.  In my opinion, we as a society are getting the worst parts on both ends.  We pay like we are getting socialized care (essentially everyone is asked to throw in a large amount of money), but in fact a lot of that money goes to for-profit entities and inflated compensation.  Meanwhile, the burdens fall unfairly on the subset of society that you might characterize as the \"lower-middle class\" who make enough to put themselves out of subsidy/medicaid/etc. range but not enough to comfortably afford the large premiums required to power this system.  It's basically a regressively-apportioned tax on working people that filters through a variety of for-profit coffers before resulting in any treatment.\n\nMeanwhile, many people who pay in a large amount of money still have large deductibles, so the insurance does nothing for them unless they suffer a truly devastating ailment.

Your insurance company might push you to specific pharmacies, hospitals, drugs, whatever.  And there's a good chance that you don't have much choice in your insurance-- you get whatever your employer chooses, and your employer may have very limited choices in insurance companies.\n\nIt's all the lack of choice that comes with socialized medicine.  But then you have more money being siphoned off in various places.  It's not just corporate profits, but you have various administrators trying to figure out who should get charged how much for what, figuring out how to deny coverage and save money.  I'm sure hospitals and healthcare providers have a harder time working out their budget and pricing things, and figuring out where all their funding is coming from.  Employers need to spend administrative overhead to manage the insurance plans.  People might still have problems paying their medical bills, and then you have collections agencies.  You might find that you still get random unexpected charges, or have trouble getting a necessary procedure, because your insurance arbitrarily decides to deny your claim.

However, profit margins for these companies can be very misleading, as a huge share of the money tends to go to executive compensation (relative to public or non-profit entities).\n\n>The real question in all this is what is a fair profit for everyone?\n\nIs that the real question?  Many countries cut profit out of healthcare entirely.  Yes, individual workers like doctors, nurses, etc. certainly deserve a fair wage commensurate with their experience and expertise, but that can be taken care of without allowing for a profit or enormous exec comp costs.  For example, the UK has a public system, and Germany has a private but non-profit system of insurance.\n\n>If that was the case then all of the best people would just flow to wherever they could earn more.\n\nPublic or non-profit entities would still have to pay salaries sufficient to keep key talent on board, yes.  However, certain departments like marketing could be trimmed down greatly if they didn't have to operate in a business environment.  I don't think IT would be substantially impacted, for what it's worth.\n\n>But is an orthopedic surgeon who makes 800k-1M worth 4 or 5 times as much as a GP who makes 200k?\n\nThis is exactly the sort of question we need to ask.  I am certain that many doctors provide immense value to society, but are wages in the millions justified?  Even more importantly, are similar wages for various executive positions justified?  I think there are a lot of costs that can be cut in a variety of areas, but there is no incentive to do so right now.  From a business perspective it just makes sense to throw oodles of cash to top performers to retain talent, even \"star talent\" when it comes to surgeons and such.  In the end we all pay for that, even the folks who would never have an opportunity to receive treatment from top talent.\n\n>Why do we allow drugs to be sold elsewhere for 2 dollars a pill but when they are sold here they cost 500 a pill. Yet it's an American company.\n\nThat one is a thorny question.  On one hand, there needs to be an incentive to develop new drugs.  On the other hand, without any real price controls things can get WILDLY out of hand.  There are tons of little monopolies in medicine, and an enormous, ENORMOUS amount of obfuscation around coding and pricing.  Why does the present system encourage hiding costs rather than require transparency?

But again, many of those positions would not be necessary in a public system.\n\nI don't think executive compensation is a red herring at all.

It is located near the top of the Continental Divide and we primarily use it for hunting, fishing, hiking and just relaxing.  I am here closing it up for the winter now that hunting season is over.  Soon it may snow too heavily to easily access it without parking half a mile down the road and hiking up on snowshoes (exhausting! But many people still do this for fun and even hunt with them.)  Most of the year, there isn't even wifi up here at all except when I can connect to the neighbors wifi in winter.  Snow somehow makes the signal reach further up the hill?  Or maybe he moves his router?  There is also zero cellphone signal.  Most people who choose to live this way are the type of person who reads lots of books, hates phones and computers, dislikes getting their food from restaurants, in general dislike even shopping for groceries, and usually prefer constructive crafts like wood making, carpentry, gardening or leather making stuff.  I have neighbors here who live year round who each do those kinds of things as a hobby and job. It's an entire lifestyle people seek out that is purposely as far away from city life as possible.  Theaters, concerts, malls, coffee shops, restaurants, etc... they don't really interest me very much.  I like to entertain myself mostly.  If I ever get bored, it means I need to expand myself a little and find something to do.  In the past I've learned cooking, gardening, writing books, wood working, car repair, and even lock smithing just to not be bored.  I've even tried other stuff like learning magic tricks, juggling, archery, and once even tried my hand at spear fishing once I found out that was apparently a legal thing to do.\n\nIt's difficult at times.  I've been here 3 days on vacation and I obviously miss technology enough to be huddled in the cold corner of the cabin on my phone so I can get some wifi.  Otherwise I'd probably be hiking, maintaining the property, reading a book, fishing, cooking or maybe even just nothing at all.  I'm a counselor and it's nice to get out of the office and just do absolutely nothing and have zero contact with humanity.  At home I'd probably be playing a video game or reading and completely avoiding other humans anyways; except for my new girlfriend of course whose also here with me (now you may actually guess why I'm here!). It's not like home is much better.  I live in a town with a population of roughly 2,000 people and everything is located on Main Street.  There aren't many restaurants, there's no theater, there's a library, a few parks, and lots of gas stations with casinos attached (gambling machines are legal here) and more bars than gas stations.  I don't really like any of those things and stick to myself.\n\nI guess in the end the answer is whatever I want to do, so long as I myself can execute the entertainment on my own or with very few others.  Many people would think that is very limiting, on the contrary I feel it is very freeing and allows me to enjoy life, other people, and my interests however I see fit and entirely on my time.  There is very little stress in my life and I attribute it to not having to deal with thousands of people in my face everyday, being lost in an ocean of humanity where I am completely insignificant.

PAO1, like many *P. aeruginosa* strains, encode [R and F pyocins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12423794) on its genome. These pyocins are large phage-tail like bacteriocins that are released through autolysis (in this case a holin-endolysin system). What's interesting about this is this autolysis pathway is controlled by the SOS response. Basically, in the same manner that RecA* will induce cleavage of LexA, RecA* induces cleavage of the pyocin transcriptional repressor PrtR. In other words, cell damaging agents (such as mitomycin C or peroxide) which trigger the SOS response can also mess with the cells by triggering this lysis pathway, and *P. aeruginosa* for whatever reason seems to be extra sensitive to this lysis pathway [in a biofilm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25968642). \n\nPyocin production has also been shown to increase [sensitivity to Ciprofloxacin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491574) although in a wacky way the cells seem to upregulate the repressor of pyocins (prtR) when experiencing ROS which makes sense in a \"don't let ROS kill off everyone\" sort of way. Nevertheless, too much ROS will override this *Pseudomonas* safety net. So my question is do you think these pyocins play any role in mediating the increased sensitivity to Tobi with the E-scaffold? Fig. 5 of this paper has the broad \"membrane damage\" point, but doesn't mention the potential role of pyocins in this scenario. Once the pyocin lysis proteins are triggered, cells will internalize PI rapidly, demonstrating the relationship of pyocin autolysis to membrane damage. Are you guys running any transcriptomics now?
