I tell you, I find the Duchess of Cambridge HOTTTT with four t's and capital letters so you know I mean business. I'm roughly the same age as Will and Kate, so I've always found Kate attractive and probably will continue to find her attractive as she ages relative to myself. \n\nI mean, I sure as shit don't find tween-age girls attractive anymore like I did when I was 13. But when I was 13 a woman in her mid-30's looked old to me. It's like watching some TV commercial where there's a mother and a daughter - has anybody else hit the age where now you're getting turned on by the mother and not the daughter? \n\nAnyways. I think Kate is within my field of Attractiveness Relativity. When I'm 50 she's going to look HOTTTT, you know, for a 50 year old relative to my own perception. But some 19-year-old is gonna be like \"she's so old, brah, but that Princess Charlotte's got it going on. Let's look at more holo-pictures of her while this Google Car drives itself.\" \n\nLet's extend this to a 90 year old man. Is Elizabeth the Two still attractive to a 90 year old man who has grown up with the Queen progressing through the years at the same level of age-related hotness-degradation relative to his own? Or do you hit an age where Attractiveness Relatively ends and we break into some new dimension of beauty appreciation that's beyond my ability to perceive?\n\nIn conclusion, I'm getting old and focusing on how women are attractive in different ways keeps me from thinking about the inevitability of death and whether I've done anything meaningful with my life AND BOOM stream of consciousness over.\n\nEDIT: Reddit gold?

An example of this is one scene where Winston Churchill is taking a bath and having one of his employees read the news to him through the door -- we have personal accounts from his aids of this being a routine thing. \n\nI think I also read an interview from some of the writers about how it would be a bit silly to pump up the drama for this show, because it was already such a dramatic story.

I tell you, I find the Duchess of Cambridge HOTTTT with four t's and capital letters so you know I mean business. I'm roughly the same age as Will and Kate, so I've always found Kate attractive and probably will continue to find her attractive as she ages relative to myself. \n\nI mean, I sure as shit don't find tween-age girls attractive anymore like I did when I was 13. But when I was 13 a woman in her mid-30's looked old to me. It's like watching some TV commercial where there's a mother and a daughter - has anybody else hit the age where now you're getting turned on by the mother and not the daughter? \n\nAnyways. I think Kate is within my field of Attractiveness Relativity. When I'm 50 she's going to look HOTTTT, you know, for a 50 year old relative to my own perception. But some 19-year-old is gonna be like \"she's so old, brah, but that Princess Charlotte's got it going on. Let's look at more holo-pictures of her while this Google Car drives itself.\" \n\nLet's extend this to a 90 year old man. Is Elizabeth the Two still attractive to a 90 year old man who has grown up with the Queen progressing through the years at the same level of age-related hotness-degradation relative to his own? Or do you hit an age where Attractiveness Relatively ends and we break into some new dimension of beauty appreciation that's beyond my ability to perceive?\n\nIn conclusion, I'm getting old and focusing on how women are attractive in different ways keeps me from thinking about the inevitability of death and whether I've done anything meaningful with my life AND BOOM stream of consciousness over.\n\nEDIT: Reddit gold?

Also, she is using a weapon that is adequate for her size and probably strength to aim properly. \n\nThe above former is equivalent to a African warlord hopping up small children on meth to kill\n\nThe latter is historically common place in armed resistances and revolutions. 15 to 16 year olds faught in the civil war. 12 year olds would have been useless except for as I said human shields to keep the enemy from attacking. ", "id": "dapxcyk"}, {"comment": "I was not aware that you could compare mental and emotional capacity by looking at a black and white photo. Which by the way is the reason why employing child soldiers is immoral and illegal - the emotional vulnerability, not the physical limitations.\n\nSpeaking of the physical limitations around which you base your entire argument - those are M1 Carbines these boys are holding. They  shoot .30 rounds one at a time. These are tiny weapons, that shoot tiny bullets at a controllable pace. If willing, then these children can wield that weapon perfectly well and with deadly results. I was one hell of a shot with a much heavier rifle when I was their age.\n\nThe girl on the other is holding a PPSh-41 that fires a 7.62  Mauser style round at a ridiculous 1000 rounds a minute - that girl would not be able to control the recoil of that weapon, because grown men twice her size may struggle to do that.\n\nSo I ask again, what magic happens in that 1 or 2 years that makes an innocent child transform into the \"good kind of meat shield\" at the age of 15?\n\nPS: [Here picture is Alfred Czech](http://imgur.com/Cp1Ys) with his Iron Cross that he earned for destroying  multiple Soviet tanks with a Panzerfaust, rescuing german soldiers on the battlefield and capturing a Soviet soldier as a prisoner.

The tiny machine output black & white video and had a built-in RF modulator to display on one of two TV channels. The 1K ZX80 was updated to the ZX81 in March 1981 with 2K of memory. In July 1982 watch maker Timex began selling the Timex Sinclair 1000 clone of the ZX81 at their dealership network in the United States. At a retail price of $99.95, this was the first fully assembled computer for less than $100. The machine had an expansion port into which a $200 16K memory expansion could be plugged. The membrane keyboard was made a little easier to use by the single keyword entry feature of the Sinclair machines. The TS1000 was followed by the color Timex Sinclair 2068 in 1983 with a cartridge port and composite video output.

Due to the 16-bit-wide data bus and more efficient instruction decoding of the 80186, the Tandy 2000 ran significantly faster than other PC compatibles, and slightly faster than the PC AT. (Later IBM upgraded the 80286 in new PC AT models to 8 MHz, though with wait states.) The Tandy 2000 was the company's first computer built around an Intel x86 series microprocessor; previous models used the Z80 and 68000 CPUs.\n\nIt was a much better computer than the current IBM PCs.

The tiny machine output black & white video and had a built-in RF modulator to display on one of two TV channels. The 1K ZX80 was updated to the ZX81 in March 1981 with 2K of memory. In July 1982 watch maker Timex began selling the Timex Sinclair 1000 clone of the ZX81 at their dealership network in the United States. At a retail price of $99.95, this was the first fully assembled computer for less than $100. The machine had an expansion port into which a $200 16K memory expansion could be plugged. The membrane keyboard was made a little easier to use by the single keyword entry feature of the Sinclair machines.

Meanwhile in China you can't as a foreigner buy or be majority shareholders in major companies. Very few people or businesses that are non Chinese are allowed to truly make vast sums of money in China. Apple is an example and after much government pressure they invested billions into a Chinese company that has nothing to do with their core business to please the Communist Party.\n\nCertain strategic sectors for example require a Chinese partner in order for you to do business in China at all, like the auto industry. The true objective is for you to build their up their industry, transfer know how and for you to foster your own Chinese competitor down the road. And everyone loves it!\n\nCoca Cola tried to buy a major Chinese beverage maker and had their negotiating position hacked right when they were supposedly close to sealing the deal. The next day a domestic Chinese company comes out of nowhere and instantly buys them out instead.\n\nRio Tinto shrugged off a Chinese take over bid and their Chinese office was raided immediately and their Chinese executive staff charged with espionage.\n\nSo to sum it up, business interests will suck China's dick for a chance to make a small bit of money while building up their own competitors. The NYTimes wrote a great piece on how Wall Street is busy trying to blow the CCP by hiring all their children and throwing money at them in hopes that they will open up part of their investment banking sector to them. Which will never happen.\n\nJust look at Hollywood bending over backwards for China in recent movies with Chinese ad placements and China centric plots. There will never be another major studio movie that portrays China negatively as they and anyone involved in the film will be blacklisted from the soon to be world's largest movie market. See Brad Pitt and Seven Years in Tibet.\n\nBut no ones gonna do anything about it because US business interests stand to lose more than Chinese business interests, given the strong hand their government has in business. Also, our transparency, fairly good governance, and checks on government powers is our weakness, they know and exploit that.

In his travels to flee across the border into Austria he found himself on a train headed to Austria when the soviets stopped the train and made them all stand in a train yard, with about 50 people all lined up, soviet soldiers walked the line looking at faces and checking photos to see if they matched. If they did match they executed them. My grandfather said that he knew if he didn't act quickly he'd be dead along with his best friend. That's when they decided to run for the border (about 3 football fields distance) he said that once they began running everyone began running. After about a football field and a half length he had to army crawl holding a little girl across the Austrian border because they were shooting guns and tank shells into the field they were running across. After making it close to the border they ceased fire to ensure they wouldn't shoot into Austria. He said he remembers vividly staring down the barrel of a gun pointed in his face as he stood on the Austrian border. \n\nAfter getting to Austria he sold various things on the black market as a black marketeer. I asked him if he sold organs he told me no....I think he did HAHA but he swears it was just contraband items. After about two years of that he decided to come to America by joining the United States Military, more specifically the army. He served in a few wars (can't remember them to be honest) then he said in his final years in the American military him and his friend had picked up hookers and got drunk with them.
