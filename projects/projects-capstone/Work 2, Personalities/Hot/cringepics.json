Like if someone is having a panic attack they could pop one and feel better pretty soon IF they could convince themselves it was okay to take the pill, which is also a common symptom of anxiety (mistrust of medication). \n\nTo answer your question: Xanax makes you feel like \"everything is okay, everything is going to be fine\" as opposed to \"I might die in the next few hours and even if I don't things are going to shit and will never be okay and oh my god I cannot take feeling this someone please help me *I need assistance please!*\" \n\nIt also oftentimes makes you feel sleepy, especially because anxiety is exhausting. It might reveal your hunger because anxiety can make you feel like eating is fucking *never going to happen, ever again* and maybe you haven't eaten in a while (a few days). \n\nIt can also make you feel a bit floaty, particularly in higher doses. That's why it has a big potential for abuse and is a controlled substance. People can develop a tolerance pretty darn quick!

It was a bit like Google Allo but you had to actually type. She was alone that night but your mum and your auntie were due back from a sleepover the following morning. But your granny and I decided I'd drive over anyway to spent the weekend. Thing is, even when your mum did get back she was being picked up more or less straight away for the rest of the weekend. So all I had to do was stay in the bedroom for half an hour and your mum wouldn't see me and there'd be no awkward questions. So I drove through the night and arrived at 1am. We had the most wonderful night together. \n\nWhat? Oh yes. Your mum was 10 then. They lived in a tiny cottage in the middle of the countryside, where the IMAX and Shopping MegaEmporium is now. It was like a dolls house with one room and a kitchen downstairs and two tiny bedrooms upstairs. \n\nThe following morning, your granny left me naked in her bed. Your mum and auntie got home and were having breakfast. Next thing I knew, your mum walked into the bedroom. \n\nWell. She just looked at me. \"Hi\" she said. \"Hi\" I said back. She picked up a hair bobble and walked out. \n\nI frantically texted your granny with \"Oops. I think I just met T\". But of course, being in the countryside I forgot I didn't have any signal, so granny didn't get the message. This was before the days of signal everywhere because we didn't need it for our toasters then, and the government were still pretending not to listen to everything. So granny didn't know what had happened. She sent her girls off for the weekend without anyone mentioning that her 10yo has just found a naked man upstairs. \n\nAnd you know how nuts your mum is? She didn't mention it to her sister all weekend. Nothing. \n\nGranny talked to them when they got back and I'd left. We agreed I'd meet them soon, and the plan was to take them for dinner in a couple of weeks then slowly start spending more time with them. The cottage was for them and I wouldn't be intruding for a long while, I'd only visit when your mum was at your granddad's house. Yes, darling. The grandad that's in prison now. Of course, that never worked out either, the second time I visited your granny I got wheeled out of the cottage wearing nothing but her pink dressing gown whilst tripping on morphine, then had to stay all week.

", "id": "d93t76u"}, {"comment": "Ah well... since you ask...\n\nMy partner lived in a tiny village. Just a pub, and a few houses. Her cottage was in a row of former farm workers cottages. A lovely little Cotswolds hamlet, and the sort of place where unusual occurrences would be talked about for years. \n\nHer bathroom was downstairs in an small extension. Houses didn't have bathrooms when these were built. \n\nIt was my second ever visit. The kids were away for the weekend with their dad so it was safe. But I'd been having problems with my back. I'd had to have a couple of days off work,  but by the time I was due to be driving over it had eased. This was a mistake. The drive was agony, two hours in a car was a bad idea. I'd had to stop a few times to get out. I say get out. I mean haul myself up out of my seat by grabbing the outside of the door and lifting myself out. Pressing the clutch nearly brought me to tears. Like I said, a bad idea. \n\nIn bed that night, the only way I could move was by grabbing the metal bars of the headboard and pulling myself up and over. \n\nThe following morning I headed for a shower. Naked. Halfway down the stairs I locked up, each foot on different steps. Electricity shot through every part of my body. I couldn't move. Breathing sent sparks down my legs. I started screaming. \n\nMy partner came running, and had to get me down to the bottom floor. It was only three steps and it was the worst agony I have ever experienced.  I couldn't get to the sofa and I couldn't get fully onto the floor. She had to get a duvet to stop me agonisingly shivering, and kneel behind me to take the weight off my arm whilst she called an ambulance. \n\nThe paramedic came and told me to take as much gas and air as I wanted. This had the usual side effect of me finding the whole thing hilarious. But didn't touch the pain. I was given oral morphine, just to move me to the sofa. It was decided that my partner and the paramedic would support me and I'd just have to grit my teeth for getting up and taking three or four steps. It's all a bit hazy but I remember telling them not to bother covering my modesty, since paramedics are used to cocks. Though during the manoeuvre they did manage to get my partners pink dressing gown onto me.\n\nAn hour passed and the pain was no better. I couldn't move. The only thing was to give me IV morphine. But that means I had to go to hospital to be monitored. So the paramedic called for a proper ambulance to take me. My partner was wearing her student nurse hoodie, and the paramedic offered to let her give me the morphine. However, as she'd only been on the course for 2 weeks she politely declined and he did it. \n\nTwo burley ambulance men arrived with a trolley. I was now having the best time of my life. I'd been sucking Nitrous for an hour and had the single best drug in the world coursing my veins. Never mind the dressing gown, the entire world was pink and fluffy. \n\nThe paramedic asked me to rate my pain out of ten again. \"Still 11, but weirdly I don't care\".\n\n\"That's the morphine, off we go\" \n\nIt was the oddest and most incredible feeling. The pain had not gone. What had happened was the separation of the emotional and cognitive aspects. Amazing. \n\nI then had to be wheeled down her long front garden in nothing but a pink dressing gown, an ambulance and a paramedic car idling on the narrow street of a sleepy Cotswold village. On only my second visit. I couldn't put my legs flat so anyone looking could see right up the dressing gown. And I was completely off my tits, waving to the neighbours. \n\nTo my eternal disappointment, the paramedic declined to be in a selfie with me. \n\nSo, I was taken to A&E. My new girlfriend went off to pick up pyjamas and things in case I was admitted. I spent the most lovely afternoon lying on a bed on a drip of hardcore painkillers. 3 hours? 6 hours? I've no idea. A young nurse came to give a painkiller suppository. That was nice too.\n\nI'd slipped a disc in my lower spine. I could barely walk and certainly couldn't drive, so had to stay for a week. So I met the kids again. Hobbling around their living room in my new dressing gown and sitting uncomfortably on their sofa. I think by now I'd made an excellent impression. \n\nMy partner went to the pub a few days later and I'd been the talk of the village. \"How is, ummm, *that chap* who was wheeled out of your house?\"  they inquired. And continued to do so for quite some time. \n\n\n\nAddendum: my partner, in her rush to get to the hospital, didn't check the items she bought me and to this day they have security tags on them.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "d9nixzk"}, {"comment": "Wow what do ya know.

Our sexual preferences are nature and nurture. Almost nobody is an ace at intercourse when they first become active. You learn and thing are taught to you. Sometimes things are forced on you. But I believe that once you pass a certain threshold and it doesn't make you feel violated, you will return to that behavior because it exceeded boundaries(self-discovery) and feels fantastic. Rape is not a joking matter, so that's my bad.  I also believe we should observe the people that we have around our children better. I've met multiple people that were molested repeatedly as children by a family member who was considered a player. The dad or step dad had a lot of ladies on the side, but still violated children at home. No one suspects those kind of guys to be molesters(probably the police in an investigation type scenario).

The eldest daughter (who I'll call Lisa) was in my year (17 years old at the time) and her little sister was about 13. From what we understand, they were having financial difficulty- the father worked in Korea still and so was away a lot. Lisa missed school a lot so it wasn't unusual for her not to be in for a few days, but one day after school while waiting for the drama production rehearsals to start another friend of mine (and Lisa's) decided she was going to go check on Lisa at her house. She was pulled aside by the Head of the senior college and told that something had happened, and she shouldn't go around there.\n\nThe Mum, Lisa and her little sister had been found in the car in the garage. The Dad flew back from Korea, attended the private family funeral, and then killed himself.\n\nI remember my friends and I were some of the first to hear, and we had to tell people as they arrived for rehearsal what had happened. Rehearsal was cancelled, obviously. We sat around and wandered the stage aimlessly, crying and hugging. The hostels called back the boarders for an emergency meeting and so I sat, in tears, while everyone stared at me wondering what was going on. I remember feeling sick while everyone else was told.\n\nWe don't really know why it was so bad that they did it. The school was a private one and certainly wasn't cheap, and there's always some isolation when you move to a new country - but they'd been in NZ for a few years now. \n\nMy year group was shell shocked. Lisa was a sweetheart- very quiet, but incredibly pretty and kind. She always had ridiculously cool stationary, and I remember one of the guys in my Art History class started crying when he realised he was using a pen she had lent him. She and I were in the same badminton team, and she was always quick with a smile and encouragement. We had a private memorial for her and her sister in the school chapel - reporters snuck in and tried to ask us questions afterwards. We had to hold another of the guys back from attacking one of them - he never told us exactly what the journalist had asked.\n\nBut yeah.

(Think \"pitch\" from baseball). Typically last around ~3 hours\n* One day games ('one dayers') are 50 overs a side. Last about ~8hrs \n* Test match cricket (tests) are 5 days of game play, 8hrs a day. No maximum on overs (there is a minimum)\n\nTypically a T20 is a great way for \"newbie\" cricket fans to get into the game. You'll get the general feel of the game and it's faster pace, a lot bigger hitting (more 6s and 4s) and so on. It's a bit more of a \"rock concert\"\n\nOne dayers still have a bit of that faster pace still, but a bit more strategy comes into play. It's still has bigger hitting, but it also requires a bit of long term planning as well. It's more of a \"Indie band concert\". Still a bit loud, but a bit more mellow.\n\nTests are the mammoth beasts. 5 days. You don't so much as watch a test match, as you let it flow over you. The best test match by far is the Boxing Day match just after Christmas. All the Christmas shit has finished and so you spend the next 5 days doing sweet fuck all. You move the TV outside to the backyard, have a BBQ, drink beer, watch the cricket (at times) and enjoy summer. Set up a slip and slide or kiddy pool or maybe play some backyard cricket.

", "id": "d8z2box"}, {"comment": "*Ok good night* \n\nIt should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit \"women are crazy\" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

Of course everyone has problems. There have been peer reviewed study showing a white man in America, even with a record, has an easier time finding a job than a black man with none.\n\nWhite privilege does not mean every white person has it easy and that every non white has it hard. It doesn't mean all white people are racists out to hold minorities down. It just means being part of the majority group is usually more beneficial than being a minority in most countries. The white privilege people refer to is based on strictly American population and race demographics. There are always exceptions. I probably had more privilege than some whites since my black parents were/are upper middle class architects. There are poor and disadvantaged white people but it doesn't negate an over all trend of white privilege.\n\nAlso overt personal racism is different than institutionalized racism which is on a macro systematic schale. Any race is capable of racism. I have seen the white and asians bullied when I went to a majority black school. A group needs to dominate an area or be part of the majority to be part of large scale systematic institutionalized racism. This doesn't mean there is group of white men maliciously trying to bar minorities from jobs. Are there white people like that? Yes but they are probably much smaller than the ones who do it unconsciously. The concept of homogeneity dictates that we are more likely to mate with, be friends with, date and give unconscious favoritism to those similar to us. This could be in race, socioeconomic status or hobby. It's a big part of the reason white people usually date other white people. It's not because whites are racist or hate the look of other races. This phenomenon carries over to the job market. Remember whites are 63%(72 if you count white hispanics like those from spain).

Git stores your code in these things called \"branches\", which you can kind of think of as folders in a filesystem. \"master\" is the main branch/folder, and it's common for programmers to work by copying master into a new folder/branch just for themselves, editing the code in their personal WIP branch until they're happy with it, and then copying their changes back over to master once they're done with their work and sure that it's ready to go. The \"master\" branch is where you put all the code that is supposed to be done and confirmed working. \n\nThat process of copying your WIP branch changes back over to the \"master\" folder/branch is what's called \"pushing to master\", and it's a totally routine part of working. Unfortunately though, if you and another programmer have both worked on the same files at the same time in your own different personal branches, git doesn't know who's changes to save when you try to push your branches back in--you both changed the files in different ways at the same time, so it just doesn't know who's changes (or both) should take priority. You have to manually go through all the conflicting files and tell git which lines to keep from whose changes. It's generally a pain in the ass to try and resolve these changes and make sure that the program is still working, since there's potentially a ton of conflicts and you need to understand both your own and your coworker's changes.\n\n\"Force pushing\" is telling git to just completely forget *everything* that \"master\" is right now, delete it, and replace it with your WIP branch instead. It means you don't have to resolve any conflicts, because you're just completely deleting the old \"master\" off the face of the earth, forever and ever amen, and overwriting it with your WIP branch instead. This is tempting to some programmers because fixing merge conflicts is so annoying, but it's a fucking horrible practice for a bunch of reasons:\n\n* any changes any other programmers *finished* after you started your WIP branch are potentially lost forever, since you deleted the version of master that had them. better hope they still have their personal branches saved\n* any changes any other programmers *started* after you started your branch are going to have absolutely horrible merge conflicts that will be impossible to resolve without some crazy git wizardry (\"git am patch\" mostly), they may have to start all over. git won't even recognize that they're from the same codebase, because as far as git's concerned those changes came from a branch/folder that doesn't exist anymore\n* your force push completely dropped a bunch of history off of master, so it is now impossible to go back in time and get those old changes back if you need to for any reason\n\nIt's harsh but it is pretty fair to fire somebody for it IMO, depending on the context around them deciding to do it.

Friends don't owe each other anything, but it's a reciprocal relationship. Friendships take trust, and if that means just being honest that you don't wanna go to a wedding or feel really nervous about being around people, so be it.

I didn't mention her saying she joked about falling in love with me, or sending me several revealing pics of herself, showing interest...we were just joking.\n\nThe comment about Macy's and being emotionally and spiritually bankrupt were made after she called me a slave to my job and clarified that she makes \"way more money than i do\".  Up to that point, the subject of money hadn't come up once until it was used as an attack against me.  I wasn't disinterested in her once I learned she worked at Macy's, why would I be?  I don't equate a person's job with who they are.  In my opinion if that's what you base success and happiness on in general, especially how she went about it, make you bankrupt in those departments.  Hence the \"now i know who you are\" comment.  She showed me what she finds important.\n\nAnd I NEVER said I didn't care if I hurt her feelings.  I said I didn't care TO.

But trust me in that what he is saying makes little sense. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z00BNIEgn38\n\nEDIT: It was kinda sad really, cause he made a complete fool out of himself to the whole country, while dreaming of making it as a professional rapper. Everyone was laughing at him (behind his back), all except this one 50 year old christian lady in the house who had probably never heard rap before but thought he was amazing (or she was just being kind). This egged him on even more thinking he really was amazing and that he would get a music deal as soon as he got out of the house. \n\nEDIT2: Actually, its too good to miss, let me translate some of it.

The average person's leg is about 45% of the height. Assuming you are average height for a man in the US (5'9.5'') you're legs would be 31.275 inches. We'll call that 31 inches. The average penis needs about 130mL of blood to maintain an erection. The average flaccid penis is 3.5 inches. We'll start with assuming his penis is hitting the ground flaccid.\n\nIf his penis is flaccid at 31 inches that is 31/3.5 = 8.86 times the normal penis size. 8.86*130mL = 1.151 L of blood to maintain it. The average person has 4.7 to 5.5 L of blood. Going off of that upper limit, 5.5/1.151 = ~21% of total blood to maintain the erection. This means that the rest of the body would be operating on 79% of normal blood flow. You'd pass out pretty quickly from this due to lack of oxygen to the brain. Doing any physical activity would cause you to pass out even faster. \n\nNow assuming that it is erect when it hits the floor, it is only 31/5.6 or  5.5 times the normal size. This would only use .715 L or ~7.7% of total blood. You may be able to maintain this erection, assuming no physical activity, however you'd be breathing heavily to maintain the oxygen flow needed.

More people should be ok with talking to professionals it's immensely helpful in getting you to look outside yourself and see the situation for what it is. It's not unusual to want to hurt someone back, doesn't make it right. Doesn't mean there's levels to retaliation. Outing someone publicly in front of friends and family is just about as low as you can get simply because you got your feelings hurt in a relationship.

I do deep conditioning treatments a lot as well, they make your hair super silky and soft.

And I don't think it's okay to be an idiot making jokes about that. But honestly I think the reasoning of 'we're not to talk about it because someone could be transported back' is simplistic to the point of childishness. I don't imagine there are any studies that suggest a reference can do further damage to a rape survivor and I highly doubt the mention of rape will go a long way to influence their recovery/ relief process either negatively or positively.\n\nBecause let's by honest, by your logic, if a joke about rape will trigger someone to have a flashback, then literally any mention of it will too. Which means what? That it can't be mentioned ever? What then?\n\nAn asshole made a dumb joke in these comments, no arguments here, but I just think that everyone rushing to agree about how we should never, ever joke about something so serious kind of veers straight past any actual dialogue on the subject.", "id": "d8lqg5e"}, {"comment": "You're right, it's anecdotal. I'm using my experience as a rape victim to talk about how rape victims feel. How shocking. You may also notice that I also used qualifiers such as 'they can be... often' rather than 'they will be... always.' So, no, I was giving an example of what may happen as someone who is part of the group you're talking about. \n\nEveryone acknowledges that rape jokes are 'jokes'. The issue that they aren't funny, they can be offensive, or damaging, or normalise rape. And knowing that people do think that something terrible you suffered, likely the worst or one of the worst things that has ever happened to you, is joke-fodder and laughable can be damaging. Not referencing studies, again, from experience. \n\nAnd yes, some people can be triggered by any mention of rape. The difference between discussions of rape and jokes about rape is discussions about rape can often empower victims and they are often involved in them. Rape victims start discourses about rape- you're relying on a flawed slippery slope argument to justify joking about rape.\n\nThere doesn't need to be a dialogue about 'but why cant I make a joke about rape because I, having never experience it, think it's hilarious, you know, the idea that someone may be held down and have someone elses genitals inserted into them repeatedly against. their will, that doesn't make me sick, it makes me laugh, let me joke about it, don't be so PC.'

That doesn't happen. I don't care if you read about it in a magazine, no one was going to get triggered by someone joking that a test raped them and you know it too.

I am someone who was raped. There are multiple issues with rape jokes outside of the possibility of offending or triggering someone who has experienced it. \n\nSome people have never been raped and will never be raped but find using a violent sexual act as a method of evoking laughter to be distasteful and disgusting, and this is a valid reason to discourage rape jokes where you see them. \n\nRape jokes tend to normalise rape as well- you may think rape is funny because ... well honestly I don't know why. But a rapist may think you think it's funny because you're also a rapist, and feel validated. \n\nI was personally not triggered by the joke. But I can see how someone could be, as someone who has been before. One would assume that a group dorm conversation is a 'safe space' where it's unlikely people would view the worst thing that ever happened in your life as hilarious. If someone was having a bad day, or even a good day where they hadn't thought about it for a while, then yes, the sudden imagery of rape can trigger them to remember their own. For example this joke is based on the idea that the person was 'raped' by the exam. This is meant to make you, presumably, picture someone bend over a desk with a large exam paper behind them. It is funny because you cannot be raped by an exam. But once you are picturing someone bent over a desk by a larger piece of paper you realise that's absurd, a piece of paper couldn't do that. So you replace the piece of paper with a person, the image makes sense now. And then the person has a face. The face of your rapist. And then it's not funny.\n\nBut no, you don't need to trigger someone for your rape joke to not be ok. You can just not joke about rape because rape isn't funny and you're not funny for thinking it is.", "id": "d8msp09"}, {"comment": "But we fully understand, and I'm sure all simply read his comment as analogy to say that the test was difficult. It doesn't even conjure images of a test trying to rape someone, as that's absurd. \n\nSo pretty much by your reasoning, we shouldn't make any jokes that could be related to any traumatic thing that could happen to someone out there:\n\nNo death jokes (everyone has lost someone)\n\nNo war jokes (out of respect to war veterans with PTSD)\n\nNo jokes implying violence (many people have suffered some form of abuse/assault)\n\nNo jokes about drinking/being drunk (because there are alcoholics who are struggling with a disease that might be triggered)\n\nNo jokes about drugs (many recovering or struggling addicts out there)\n\nNo pedobear jokes (obvious reasons)\n\nPretty much we could go down the line and eliminate all forms of humor for fear of offending or upsetting someone. Why pick one? I've had bad things happen to me and my family. I don't want to control other people's ability to make analogies out of dark situations just because I have experienced them. Humor is part of what makes the crappy parts not so bad.\n\nMaybe you do, but I don't really want to live in a world where we can't be free to express ourselves and take a shot at innocent humor for fear of who it might offend. It's a slippery slope, and in my mind, another brand of fascism or extremism in a self-righteous wrapping. Extremism is dangerous in any form.\n\nI also think it's very naive to think someone is going to assume it's cool to rape people because someone made a joke about a difficult test.\n\nAgain, keep downvoting away people, but if you have made even one jest on some of the subjects I've listed but just don't like this one particular one, you're a hypocrite.", "id": "d8nccms"}, {"comment": "Very good point, I hope the other user read this.", "id": "d8p8k6a"}, {"comment": ">You can just not joke about rape because rape isn't funny and you're not funny for thinking it is.\n\nThat's an opinion.

Also the idea that negging is equivalent to not treating her like a person is just plain wrong. Proper negging is more like teasing a little sister than an insult. It's not supposed to be something a bully or an obnoxious douche would say. It's more playful than anything else. Let's say there's a super hot woman in a dress and all the guys are intimidated by her so she's got an attitude. Then let's say she has a red nose because she's been drinking wine and then in the middle of the conversation the guy says something along the lines of \"Hey you've got a red nose that's so cute. You're like a little Eskimo!\". That's not a very good example lol, but that's because I'm not particularly good at negging. Anyway, my point still stands and it is that saying this to a woman who's supposed to be super intimidating to men makes her suddenly appear more like an equal human being than this unattainable goddess every other guy make her seem to be. It's not insulting. It has nothing to do with treating her not like a person. It's supposed to be used in very specific cirumstances. Not on every woman at any time.

But throwing a playful insult at a girl you are familiar with while immediately following it up with a \"I'm just messing with you, you know you are beautiful\"\n\n\nThat isn't negging. In normal flirting or friendly interactions, that is called teasing or playful banter. The intention isn't to make someone feel self-conscious or to manipulate people based on their insecurities. It is supposed to be fun and about building rapport. Also, it is common in platonic relationships as well as romantic ones - siblings and friends give each other shit all the time. It is normal goofing off behavior among people who trust each other - which maybe why friendly teasing is such a good flirting technique. If you can successfully friendly tease someone you are flirting with, you are mimicking behavior that they associate with people they care about and trust. It also demonstrates social skills, in that you demonstrate you can read your audience and the social cues they are giving you, and correctly gauge your tease/jokes to be appropriate.\n\n\nOn the other hand, negging - backhanded compliments or teasing intended to prey on insecurities - is something else entirely.

Now we have candidates openly talking about \"hand size\" and being caught doing tons of criminal things. Now yes, politicians have a long history of being crooked but usually that kind of stuff before the election kills their run but it's all fair game this time. \n\nIf you can't see why people are blown away this election then maybe you should watch the next debate.
