He was \"living\" in a medically induced coma for 5 weeks. In the meantime he took up a critical care bed for 5 entire weeks. A bed that could have helped 15 other people actually recover and live. Eventually the family relented and he was taken off of life support and given pain medication to ensure that his death was as comfortable and non-traumatic as possible. His family made peace with the decision and were grateful with everyone at the end. They were lovely people they just had a hard time letting him go. But he could not live any longer. Eventually the medication will stop working and they will die anyways. We see this in the ICU frequently, actually. The patient's poop takes on a grayish hue and becomes foul and putrid and their body begins to rot from the inside out. That's when you know for sure that they will die one way or the other within about 48 hours. \n\n\nWhat's the alternative? Keep them alive until you can't physically/chemically do it any longer and then break all of their ribs into mush doing CPR trying to delay the inevitable? It's unpleasant. Many times families will tell you to stop CPR because they didn't know how brutal it was and they can't stand to watch it. And we don't even cut people's chests open anymore to do a manual heart massage.\n\n\nYou may see it as a cold calculation to save money. But I do this everyday as a living and I see it from the other side. Not everyone can be saved. Occasionally you take someone off of life-support expecting them to die and the stimulation of that process and the withdrawal of the drugs (the ones that medically induce the coma) are enough to push them around the corner and they begin to get better.

(The actual cost of the drug inside it is about $1.)\n\nSo the high prices paid for the Epi-Pen have nothing to do with some saintly company developing new drugs and everything to do with executives getting very rich -- the CEO of Mylan had her salary go from $2 million a year to $18 million a year from their price hikes. \n", "id": "dalzlsh"}, {"comment": "You also have to remember that the government made a law that any school receiving federal money had to keep an auto-injecting epinephrine device in their nurse's office.

Marketing is also not what you're thinking either; TV ads, magazines, and sponsorships. Rather pharma marketing around the globe and in the US is mostly aimed at doctors; luncheons, free medicine samples, give away products, fancy seminars, etc. Doctors soak up around 85% of the \"marketing\" in the US. \n\nLastly, private industry from the US funds about 30% of *global* pharmaceutical research. Even in Europe, profits from US pharmaceutical sales account for 25-40% of the net research dollars. While it is true that these nations fund research, they find at similar levels to the US and are still reliant on US based incomes for additional cash. This is the model that needs to change.

What I'm about to say is remarkably simplified (and generalized) but is roughly descriptive based on my experience working as a fraternity *volunteer* at the international level.

I despise the type of talk that describes themselves as \"top tier frat bro\" and other stupid shit like that because it's not in any way descriptive of what you really trying to get out of the college experience. Drinking alcohol and chasing girls is not unique to fraternity men, so saying that you're a \"top tier frat\" because you have lots of alcohol and lots of women is just pathetic. Instead, I'd say that there's four main \"types\" of fraternity chapters:\n\n* Preppy\n* Traditional\n* Laid-back\n* Friendly\n\n**Very roughly speaking** those four categories cover Northeast (New England, primarily), South (from Oklahoma to Georgia), West Coast (California, primarily), and Midwest (everywhere else).\n\nThe four categories I mentioned **do not** apply to a given fraternity overall throughout the country; nor do they apply universal across all universities in a given geographic region; rather, any chapter at any university will tend to gravitate towards one of those four. It just so happens that from stereotype and from \"vocal majority\" you tend to get a picture of each one of the major regions based on those four archetypes. If a given chapter doesn't conform to that list, I'm scratching my head and figuring that they're probably what I would term a \"T-Shirt Club\" which is just a derogatory term for a group that's just in it to have a membership somewhere, but not really putting in the effort to build a house culture and actually making friendship bonds.\n\nFrom what I can tell, Preppy seems to derive from before college. They were instilled with that kind of persona from boarding schools and it's basically the archetype of what I imagine the \"Exeter student goes to Harvard\" storyline looks like. A non-preppy student who joins a preppy chapter will pretty soon pick up on their fashion and on their manners, just to fit in. Out of the four main categories, this one goes along with T-Shirt Club as the one where people go to pad their resume and make business connections and to find a job after college using the alumni network. Without a doubt, this is Omega Theta Pi from Animal House.\n\n\"Traditional\" is really just a code-word here for \"longs for the olden days\" and is most associated with here-called \"conservative\" values. Most likely to be the loudest advocate for the plus-sides of college hazing, yet also most likely to play a witty prank on the campus community. When a frat hits the news, it's likely one of these. Why? Because the boring stuff doesn't make headline news.\n\nLaid-back is how I would term the stoner/surfer subculture of college students. Not as much throwing bangers and more about \"enjoying life\" as it were. \n\nLastly we come to my last group, affectionately called \"Friendly\". If Animal House's Omega is preppy, and Delta is the picture of Traditional, then Friendly must be \"everyone in the background of that movie\". This group encompasses Tri-Lam from Revenge of the Nerds and your local [Loyal Order of Water Buffalo](http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/fiction/fraternities/buffalo.html). They'll take anyone, and if they're not careful, they'll devolve into a T-Shirt Club.\n", "id": "daebs8b"}, {"comment": "It varies.

The soup kitchen ended up being seriously understaffed and when I called them to ask where the hell they were: too hungover/just not in the mood/forgot.

We got the point that we could come out even on a huge banger.  Making t-shirts as the actual ticket to the event was the best thing we ever did.\n\nThe other side of the coin was when we did things for philanthropies that our brothers were personally involved in.  For example, JDRF.  One of our brothers has juvenile diabetes so when he wanted all of us to do something we were very gung-ho and raised a shit ton of money.  Same with community stuff.  Since we were a Jewish fraternity, we did a lot of great things for the Jewish community especially sice we were in a southern SEC school where there werent a lot of Jews, and the local Jewish community was pretty lacking.\n\nWe would also make pledges run a philanthropy event and give them a goal of money they had to raise as part of their pledge program.

He started yelling at her and I turned abruptly to face and listen. He said \"We won. Now get the fuck out of my country\" He said it over and over as I saw this poor woman crying - standing stunned - not moving. I ran to her. I threw my arms around her a turned her into me and my back towards him and sobbed with her. All I could think to say was ''I'm so sorry\" over and over again as we cried. I felt helpless.

The old postmodern insurgents risked the gasp and squeal: shock, disgust, outrage, censorship, accusations of socialism, anarchism, nihilism. Today\u2019s risks are different. The new rebels might be artists willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the \u201cOh how banal.\u201d To risk accusations of sentimentality, melodrama. Of overcredulity. Of softness. Of willingness to be suckered by a world of lurkers and starers who fear gaze and ridicule above imprisonment without law.

It's good, right? That stack of paper is obviously more wasteful than that little device, right?\n\nWell, of course, it's not. Paper can be recycled easily. Even without narrowing it down to paper, a municipal recycling program costs within a range of about $50-150 per *ton*. \n\nElectronics, meanwhile, aren't completely recyclable. Enough of them remain as trash to be a problem, [most of it ending up in China, Nigeria, and India.](https://youtu.be/EXzsqTFwV3Q) Meanwhile, paper is not only recyclable, but when exposed to the elements, will basically just melt in a short amount of time. Microbes can eat it, animals can repurpose it as nesting material, and barring that, it can just lie there in the dirt without causing too much of a problem. Electronics, on the other hand, can leak mercury and other hazardous materials into the soil. Not good. \n\nPlus, I don't think most ebook users would own nearly as many books if they weren't as easy to carry. So the comparison doesn't really work to begin with.

I will probably get shit for saying this, but I'll explain why I think this anyway. And, just to be clear, I don't hate solar energy, and I don't hate these solar farms. I just believe that there is a far better alternative to humanity's energy crisis: Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors. It is a nuclear reactor that works completely differently than the pressurized, solid fuel Reactors that are currently running all over the world. Lots of people, once they see the word 'nuclear' would immediately dismiss the idea, but just hear me out. These reactors, for one, are much safer than our current nuclear reactors. LFTRs operate at nearly atmospheric pressure, while the current types of reactors we use (Pressurized Water Reactors, and Boiling Water Reactors) run at much higher pressures, which means that if the containment unit is breached, the pressurized contents of the reactor core will be violently shot out, irradiating everything around it. The explosions at Fukushima were a result of that high pressure, and their inability to keep their nuclear reactions from going off the rails. This leads to the second advantage LFTRs have over conventional reactors: They don't use solid fuel like BWRs and PWRs do. Solid fuel is much more difficult to deal with, especially during a crisis such as what happened to Fukushima. Solid fuel has to constantly be cooled even after the reactor has been shut down, to keep the nuclear reaction at bay. Liquid fuel, however, can just be drained into specialized containment units that are specifically designed to absorb neutrons, and stop the reaction. So even if a LFTR core was breached, the contents could still drain into these tanks. \nAnd here's some other reasons LFTRs are amazing:\n\n1) They are MUCH more efficient than PWRs and BWRs. (On the level of ~1% vs. ~95% efficiency) \n\n2) You can use dismantled nukes as fuel for the reactor, as well as nuclear waste from our PWRs and BWRs. \n\n3) LFTRs generate radioactive by-products that can be used for cancer treatment, various medical equipment, as well as Plutonium 238, a vital isotope for RTGs (the same type of power source currently running the Curiosity Rover) \n\n4) LFTRs use Thorium to produce energy. Thorium is one of the most common elements on Earth (as well as the moon, and Mars), and only emits small amounts of alpha radiation. If you're afraid of Thorium, you might as well be afraid of dirt, because there's a lot of Thorium in there. \n\nThere's a lot more to these things than even all that, but I personally believe these are the future of energy production for humanity. We'll see..\n\nTL;DR: I like the prospect of solar, and seeing this technology advance is very exciting, but I just don't think they can be a viable alternative energy for the entire world, imo. I believe LFTR technology, if humanity invests in it, can be the main power supply for mankind. Maybe. The future is awesome, terrifying, and unknown, so we'll see. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_fluoride_thorium_reactor\n\nHere's a SciShow about it:\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nYxlpeJEKmw\n    ", "id": "daktn71"}, {"comment": "I'd disagree that these kind of reactors will overtake solar.

As it is today our power supply has to keep up with the changing hourly demands of energy usage. Because of that you need a 24hr source (or a lot of fossil fuel support) that can increase or decrease its output throughout the day. Unfortunately that outlines the primary downfall of green alternatives (with the exception of geothermal, and biopower. The latter of which is still barely in its infancy) that they only produce when their natural source is producing. Couple that with poor battery technology to store what was harnessed and it gets a lot harder to go all green. I don't doubt that we have enough green resources to harness, what sucks is that you could have a blazingly bright day with gale force winds that we could tap into but ultimately never effectively store. The issue is a cloudy day, a low wind day, excessive unexpected power use at night, etc. that puts you at risk for a blackout.

In places like India, that might be right.

The fact that American culture permeates the world is what gives us the completely insane caricature that the rest of the world imagines. I acknowledge that electing an exact replica of that caricature as President is doing us no favors.

You think Spain is complicated? Muliply the population by 7, insert 40% of the world's wealth (shut up about the 1%, our poor people are obese for Christ's sake), inject the most diverse grouping of people in the history of the world, who have brought their cultures in at different states of progression for the last 200 years in the most insane immigration to a single piece of land in the history of the world. Then add in the most dynamic, diverse and powerful economy in the world. I won't look it up, but Spain's economy might match the state of Minnesota. After you do all that, talk to me about complicated.\n\nI know I'm way off the path at this point, but to pull it back, I'm really just defending America. It and it's people have an innumerable amount of faults. There have been unspeakable tragedies in the past and to this day, no doubt. But this cynical circle jerk of America trashing is so played out and unoriginal. Our media ridiculously reports the goings on, then it get filtered into an even more distorted version of reality by the media in the rest of the world.\n\nBut the most appalling take is that of the people who suggest the United States should follow the footsteps of Faux-Socialist, pretty much capitalist, progressive nations of western Europe. As is anything besides our opposition to the Nazis in WW2 makes us the same as Sweden, a homogenous cluster of people, with a population smaller than Dallas that are sitting on endless oil. That (as argued above) our ridiculously different and infinitely more dynamic/diverse country would just follow in the footsteps of a Nordic \"oasis\" state is beyond stupidity. This next point seems to be dismissed as \"below the intellectual level\" for some intellectually fascist reason, but the entire Scandinavian group of perfect little nations exists solely because of the implied protection of the United States. Hitler had it, we got it back for you.

For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have \"lost.\" What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.\n\nHence a phrase that has passed into hitchhiking slang, as in \"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect?

Denmeade, E. Antonarakis, C. Paller, H. Wang, T. Benjamin, C. Drake, M. Carducci, M. Eisenberger\n\n\n**Background**: Prostate cancer (PC) becomes resistant to chronic castration via an adaptive increase in androgen receptor (AR) axis activity through overexpression, gene amplification, and expression of ligand independent AR variants. AR overexpression, however, is a liability that can be exploited therapeutically. Mechanistically, supraphysiologic T induces PC death through disruption of DNA relicensing due to persistence of AR at origins of replication during the cell cycle. Ligand bound AR can also induce DNA double strand breaks in androgen starved cells re-exposed to androgen.\n\n\n**Methods**: In an ongoing study, asymptomatic men (n = 60) with CRPC and progression on A and/or E (30/cohort) receive T cypionate 400 mg IM every 28 days along with ongoing castration to rapidly cycle between polar extremes of supraphysiologic and near-castrate levels of serum T (bipolar androgen therapy, BAT). Men with declining PSA and/or stable radiographic disease can continue BAT after 3 cycles and are rechallenged with A or E at progression. Co-primary endpoints include \u226550% PSA response after 3 cycles of BAT and after re-treatment of E or A after progression to BAT. The study is designed to reject a treatment with <5% PSA response based on prior data with sequential AR targeted treatments. Secondary endpoints include objective response, safety, quality of life, and effect on CTC-based AR-V7 expression.\n\n\n**Results**: The study remains open for patient enrollment; 37 have completed at least 3 cycles of BAT and 31/37 (83%) continued on treatment beyond the initial 3 months; 11/37 (30%) had \u226550% PSA decline and 20/37 (54%) had PSAs decline <50%. 4/17 (23%) with measurable disease had RECIST responses and 11/17 (65%) had stable disease after 3 months of BAT. Of 25 men evaluable in the post BAT phase, 8 (32%) and 15 (60%) had \u226550% and <50% PSA declines after 3 months of retreatment with the same pre-study AR targeted treatment (A or E). 21/34 men tested in this group had detectable CTCs with 6/21 testing AR-V7 +. All AR-V7 + men became AR-V7 negative after BAT, and 2/6 of these AR-V7 + men had a \u226550% PSA decline. BAT has generally been well tolerated and no DLT\u2019s have been seen thus far. 1 patient had a self-limited increase in pain and 1 had urinary retention, otherwise there were no bone/soft tissue AE\u2019s with BAT to suggest disease flare.\n\n\n**Conclusions**: This preliminary data demonstrates the safety and activity of BAT in patients with CRPC post-A and/or E with PSA and objective responses, including responses in AR-V7 + men.
