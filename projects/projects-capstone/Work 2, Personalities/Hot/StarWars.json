The non-episodic movies are Disney's opportunity to depart from the tone set in IV.

Jessica Jones and Daredevil are often portrayed as being dark and gritty so having their live action versions reflect that makes sense. However, the darker tone absolutely failed to work for Luke Cage because that character is fundamentally not dark.\n\nI think this is the case for Star Wars too. It's fundamentally not a grimdark franchise. To me Star Wars should be more akin to the Marvel *movies*. It should be a lighthearted adventure story with big, bold characters. It should be pulpy and fun and kind of dumb. It should be something that both kids and their grandparents can enjoy.\n\nI'm fine with Disney exploring different genres but I really do think that Star Wars should always *feel* like Star Wars.", "id": "daqo29q"}, {"comment": "Yeah, I'm a little torn because I both agree with you and disagree with you. I think the tone you're expecting is what the episodic movies have had, and will continue to have, and if *they* ever stray from that tone I think a lot of people will be mad. \n\nThe episodes have always been full of action, politics, very personal stories about finding yourself (Luke, Anakin, Rey, Kylo Ren, even Han), and a little bit of destiny thrown on top. Mix all this together and you have stories with adventure, humor, sadness, loss, intrigue, and so on. \n\nBut Rogue One (because it's the only non-episode we have to work with so far) has a very different mission. It's telling a story of something we already know happened for a fact in Star Wars: spies stole plans to the Death Star. It's not funny, it's not mystical. It's about a very dangerous plan to infiltrate and steal something heavily guarded. To make this story as bumbly and lighthearted as the episodes would undermine the actual story they're trying to tell, which I think is one that's worth telling. \n\nSo we'll have to see in just a week or two what the reviews say. I think it'll end up being violent *for a Star Wars movie*, because most of the movie will be action as opposed to scenes of the Jedi council sitting around and talking, but not overly violent in general.

A reasonable theory would be watching a film and then using the information in that film to make conjectures about another, yet unreleased film. He hasn't seen Rogue One - nobody outside the production team has seen the full thing. So he's making a theory of an unreleased film based on another unreleased film.\n\nIf all of the Rogues die in this film, then the theory falls apart completely. He's using speculation on the outcome of the film to speculate on something else - he's not using facts to speculate. Also, there's rules for making arguments, and one of them is that an argument can be valid but not sound; that is, the premises, if true, would make the conclusion true, but an argument that is not sound has false premises. \n\nHe kind of just made up the premises of his argument: 1) they need to explain why the Rogues aren't in later films; 2) they won't kill the Rogues off because it'd be harder to sell toys (and mentions George Lucas, even though Lucas doesn't make money off Star Wars anymore); 3) they build up Jyn in the trailers, ergo Rogue One must connect to the new trilogy.\n\n1) No, they don't - the Rogues could die, or the Rogues could be on other assignments, or the Rogues could be on Hoth and simply not shown, hence why Rogue Squadron is named on Hoth. It's a reasonable argument to say we don't see the Rogues on-screen, but they're there. Also, Luke and Wedge are named Rogue One and Rogue Two as reverence for the two survivors of the Death Star runs. 2) Look at alllll the Jedi who died in Revenge of the Sith, and how many of them have had action figures. Also, the claim that they'd be selling toys based of 15 minutes of screen time is flawed because we don't know how much screen time they get, and part of the argument that the Rogues are Knights of Ren is *because* the trailers are building them up to be important. Pick one. They're either important enough to become key figures in later films or not important enough to get toys and limited screen time. But it's not like Qui-Gon didn't get an action figure, and Maul got several figures and he was on screen for literally 12 minutes total. So, again, that shoots down that argument - obviously kids *are* willing to buy figures of someone who not only dies but also gets less than 15 minutes of screen time.\n\nWhat was the last one? Oh, right - they build up Jyn in the trailers so Rogue One must connect to the new series. \"Why would the trailers have built up Jyn so much if Rogue One wasn't going to connect to the new trilogy?\" That's a ridiculous argument. *Because she's the main character and trailers always focus on the main character*. Also, it's a spin-off. Also, he hasn't even seen it, so he's basing all of this speculation on Jyn not dying in the film. By that same argument, why would the trailers fixate on Qui-Gon so much if he wasn't an important character who-- oh, he's dead by the end. Nevermind.\n\nIt's such a stupid theory. I never thought I'd say this, but it actually makes that Darth Binks theory look reasonable. *That*, at least, was how you build a theory - take existing films, a character with an unseen conclusion (we don't see him die, but we never see him again) and use that evidence to speculate on a later film. This is the exact opposite of that kind of theory: building premises on trailers alone and then speculating about the outcome of a film *and then using your guess at how the film will end to theorise about another unreleased film*.\n\n", "id": "dan5kgi"}, {"comment": "> they need to explain why the Rogues aren't in later films\n\nIf this is one of his premises, then the argument fails there.

Like the matching of each of the Rogue One crew with the Knights of Ren and other stuff. I don't believe the theory but saying it's only that is a stretch.", "id": "dangtfs"}, {"comment": "That could be coincidence, but there's also more concept art in that book that shows more than five knights. So if the premise is \"Everything has a purpose, nothing is coincidence,\" then there'd need to be more Rogues for a direct correlation. It would also undermine one of the spoilers that was given out accidentally during Star Wars Celebration.\n\nAlso, the \"sniper\" is not using a sniper rifle. Given that we're basing this on trailers alone, there's multiple occasions where we see someone using an actual sniper rifle. The rifle that the supposed \"sniper\" is using is seen being used by regular grunts. It's a rifle, sure, but if we're being specific enough to say that it's evidence of him being the \"sniper,\" then it doesn't fit that bill.\n\nAlso, he uses Vader going after the transmission as proof that possibly he captured them and turned them to the Dark Side. Well, Occam's Razor says that you should follow the path that requires the least assumptions possible. That assumes a lot - capture, torture, conversion. What about something that requires fewer assumptions? He killed them. In fact, all we know is that he's not going after the source of the transmission, so we can assume that the leak is plugged. I mean, it is a *huge* jump to assume that much. Especially when, again based on the trailers, we know at least one of them has already turned from the Empire, one of them proclaims having worked for the Rebellion for a long time, and one said the Empire destroyed their home (and could actually include another one, if the \"our\" home means two of them). That's a lot of assumptions you need to make, that they'd all be broken and turned to the Dark Side. Or, for that matter, that it's something that even happens to people - after all, he does torture Han, but never converted Han, so we have no actual proof in the series of someone being tortured to the point of turning evil. But aside from that, the evidence is based on this concept art of five of them, and lining that up with the five Rogues, as if that alone is proof. Well, just as he brings up cast interviews as evidence, we know for a fact that one of the Rogues will die. So this whole five Rogues = five Knights is debunked just on that fact alone, unless you say the fifth Knight of Ren is their friend Barry filling in; though by that stage, you're simply making shit up and it doesn't matter anyway.\n\n*And* it leaves a lot more unanswered, open questions than the fewest assumptions of \"They're dead\" or \"They're alive, but fighting for the Rebellion on another front\" - it is, after all, a big universe. Because this Ren theory *still* means that they're not only alive, but they're converted to the Dark Side *and* kept in hiding or working for the Empire elsewhere during not only the collapse of the Empire, but also during the rise of the First Order and only *then* reveal themselves. So if this is all an attempt to argue that Rogue One *must* tie into the new trilogy because reasons, then why make all these assumptions to argue that fact when you can just as easily, and with fewer leaps, say, \"They're still Rebels, but they haven't showed up yet.\" Why not just say they're Resistance officers (and likely too old to be frontline soldiers anymore) and we just haven't seen them?\n\nIt's a terrible way to make an argument. It's epileptic trees level of theorising. A great theory takes work and requires using evidence.

Kanan and Ezra's existence totally diminishes Luke's importance, and moreover, it makes it even harder to believe that the entire Galaxy forgot the Jedi in just the span of 19 standard years.

Towards the very end he'd \"come out\" as a Jedi, and be hunted by Vader, and then at the very end of the show Vader would finally find and kill him, during the same mission in which the rebels steal the Death Star plans. Thus, Vader thinks he extinguishes the Jedi Order, but we all know the New Hope is about to emerge. \n\nWhen I heard about Rebels and watched the first episode I thought they had actually taken my idea and brought it to life.

Why is Jyn surrounded by dudes? You can say why not, but genuinely why? They're all made up.

I guess getting another brunette is possibly chance although an argument could be made that the stigma connected to blonde hair played a (subconcious) role and even if the actress is white - brown hair makes her possibly more relateable to a far bigger portion of the potential movie going audience worldwide.\n\nI guess the big similiarities in female Star Wars characters in the movies is due to the specifics of the franchise and its world and plot outlines (lots of archetypes in the movies). That doesn't mean I wouldn't like to see different characters but General Leia, Captain Phasma and Maz seem like steps into that direction and its nice to see that on both sides you have women in all sorts of positions (stormtroopers, control room people, pilots etc), main characters still very similiar although thats also true for the males (Luke & Anakin).\n\nBut yes, Jyn is still surrounded by dudes and I figure this is shows that Hollywood has a bit of a problem of what to do with female sidecharacters in action movies - either they are in some sort of supportive (non combat) role or they tend to  fall into the Michelle Rodriguez spectrum of a chick being the tuff guy which often demonstrates how the writer has no idea how a woman might behave in such a position. On a weird sidenote: Two Tom Cruise movies did an interesting variation on that - ~~Edge of Tomorrow~~ Live.Die.Repeat aswell as MI5 both had a woman in the will they won't they position but made her far more active and competent than its usual for the part...but this approach is obviously limited to a side character which also serves as the love interest in a movie without a big ensemble cast.", "id": "danhuhw"}], [{"comment": "I'm excited to see a brand new cast of characters.

He embraces love and emotion, whilst still walking the path of the Light. Obi-Wan and Yoda believe the only way to defeat the Empire's evil is to destroy Vader. And yet Luke, against their advice, follows his heart and defeats the Emperor not with an act of destruction, but with an act of love.\n\nOne of the most profound themes of the Original Trilogy is the power of redemptive love, and that, to me, is exactly what Luke represents.\n"], [23, "Oh, I love Luke. Like, I wanted to marry him as a kid. Still do. How can you not adore a character who goes from \"...but I was gonna go to Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!\" to \"I'll not leave you here, I've got to save you!\" (i.e., gains major hero-points) but remains, essentially, the same: with that honest moisture-farm-boy face and that big ol' moisture-farm-boy smile. He's so, so earnest -- a trait that I think is underrated thanks to how flashy the Han Solos of the world are. And, granted, the Hans of the world are *infinitely cooler* than the Lukes of the world. But we owe the Lukes just as much love!\n\n(*Star Wars* -- at least the first film -- is much like Luke in personality, and not just because he's the main character. It's sweet, it's sincere.)"], [13, "Luke is hope personified. His childish (whiny) nature in IV, his mediocre discipline/training in V, and his insatiable curiosity to discover what his father was like throughout the movies (even after finding out it was vader all along)-- that's what makes a simple, relatable character larger than life as an influence.  Whether it was blowing up the death star, putting his utmost faith in obiwan kenobi and yoda to train (only to panic and give in to his emotions) really makes luke a shining beacon of the rebellion and the jedi.  \n\nYou didn't mention prequel characters so I won't go into much detail, but I firmly disagree with you.  Star Wars is about the Skywalker family, but that's because THE FORCE willed it.  You don't randomly pick up a slave boy to work alongside a queen, only to find the sith (not present for many years) right on your tail.  But ever since the beginning Anakin's tragic story was always a conflict between light and dark.  Whether Anakin embraced his dark side, the environment around him was filled with the dark side, or his own mentor (palpatine) was subtly feeding him a sith agenda.  Throughout all of this, Anakin's master/father/brother Obiwan trains him properly, not through typical schooling though, but through WAR.  Anakin's world is shrouded with darkness, so when he fell in love, it was the least of his worries that his attachment would soon be his demise.  \n\nAnywho, I like Anakin.  Luke has his moments with the emperor, vader watching his sith master make his son cower in fear of the doomed rebellion... BUT sitting idly during his son's torture struck one of his few remaining nerves on a burnt, robotic shell of a body.  Not the pain he was used to experiencing in physical form, but a deeper remorse for the years spent brooding and wallowing in his own self-loathing--drunk with power.  All to watch his son be brutally murdered? \n\nLuke wanted to be like his father BECAUSE he must have known that if a boy on tatooine could become a powerful jedi, the maybe luke could hope to join the rebellion.  \n\nHe could NOT have done it without luke, or padme.  He was naive the first time and lost his wife, and he was similarly thickskulled the second time knowing lightning spelled certain death in his condition.  Anakin overthrew two SOCIETIES out of love for his family (1st the republic, 2nd the empire).  Whether he was dark or light, Anakin Skywalker fulfilled the prophecy, not in the way it was intended by the jedi, nor an age of darkness like the emperor had forseen. He did it HIS way, because the little slave boy-turned sith lord from the outer rim knew only of conflict, power struggles, poverty, and his mother's love.  His conscience came at a cost, a feeling unknown to most detached jedi.  \n\nSelling his soul to his trusted mentor, having his body butchered by his father figure/brother/master, losing his wife, kept in the dark about his children, are but a fraction of the ordeals Anakin has gone through.  He fought in the Clone Wars. HE was a hero, but he betrayed himself and sacrificed literally everything he had to keep his family safe (albeit with subpar judgment).  \n\n\ntl;dr Anakin is my favorite, Luke will always stand in his shadow.

He is the new Yoda."], [9, "Forget favorite Star Wars character, Luke is my favorite fictional character.  He is the embodiment of everything good that we are capable of.  He is loving, selfless, positive, and incorruptible, even though he has every right to be the exact opposite.  \n\nHis birthright was to be the son and apprentice of the greatest Jedi ever; instead he is born an orphan and raised in the harshest, most backwards conditions in the galaxy.  Even that modest home is destroyed and he has to see the only two people who cared for him murdered (important to note that without ANY hesitation Luke races home when he realizes they are in trouble, even though he could very well die himself).\n\nHe reconnects with Obi-Wan, putting his entire trust in a man he hardly knows; a man who is promising Luke a difficult and challenging path.  In short time he has to see Ben murdered.  Luke, believing Obi-Wan was the last of the Jedi, does not give up but dedicates himself to learning the ways of the Force on his own.\n\nHe agrees to attack the Death Star, even though everyone involved knows it is a suicide mission for the pilots taking part.  Only a short time after losing his aunt, uncle, and Obi-Wan, he also has to helplessly witness his best friend Biggs die.\n\nHe learns that the most evil man he has encountered is his father.  He chooses to die rather than join the Dark Side and the power he is promised.  \n\nHe challenges the wisdom of two Jedi Masters telling him he must kill his father.  Instead he again is willing to sacrifice his life in the slim chance that he could redeem his father.  Around this time he also watches his second Jedi mentor die.  Luke loses not just another friend, but an almost incalculable amount of ancient knowledge.  With Yoda gone Luke is left with the haunting truth that he really is the last of the Jedi.\n\nChoosing to confront two Sith Lords, Luke forgives Vader, and does everything in his power to save him.  In the end he is able to grant peace to his father and restore a man who had been lost in darkness for half a lifetime.  He gets to experience a moment or two as the son of Anakin Skywalker; then he gets to watch his father die.  As the Death Star explodes around him he takes the fallen Jedi's body with so that he can give him a proper funeral.\n\nWhile all this has been going on he has also found a girl that he deeply loves.  In another cruel twist though, he realizes their bond is one of brother and sister.  He sees her fall in love with his closest friend.  Luke is left by himself as the last Jedi; he is tasked with restoring an ancient order that once had tens of thousands of members.  He does so with great success, only to have it destroyed due to a betrayal by his own blood.  \n\nBelieving that all was lost, Luke withdraws to meditate.  He eventually senses a great disturbance; Luke's attunement to the Force leaves no doubt.  Alone on Ahch-to he faces the realization that his life-long friend has been murdered by the apprentice he failed to protect from the Dark Side.\n\nLuke has been asked to deal with enough heartbreak and hardship to break 100 men, but he somehow keeps going.\n\nTL;DR: I wish I could give Luke a big hug, and I hope the new trilogy gives him some sort of lasting peace.

His childish (whiny) nature in IV, his mediocre discipline/training in V, and his insatiable curiosity to discover what his father was like throughout the movies (even after finding out it was vader all along)-- that's what makes a simple, relatable character larger than life as an influence.  Whether it was blowing up the death star, putting his utmost faith in obiwan kenobi and yoda to train (only to panic and give in to his emotions) really makes luke a shining beacon of the rebellion and the jedi.  \n\nYou didn't mention prequel characters so I won't go into much detail, but I firmly disagree with you.  Star Wars is about the Skywalker family, but that's because THE FORCE willed it.  You don't randomly pick up a slave boy to work alongside a queen, only to find the sith (not present for many years) right on your tail.  But ever since the beginning Anakin's tragic story was always a conflict between light and dark.  Whether Anakin embraced his dark side, the environment around him was filled with the dark side, or his own mentor (palpatine) was subtly feeding him a sith agenda.  Throughout all of this, Anakin's master/father/brother Obiwan trains him properly, not through typical schooling though, but through WAR.  Anakin's world is shrouded with darkness, so when he fell in love, it was the least of his worries that his attachment would soon be his demise.  \n\nAnywho, I like Anakin.  Luke has his moments with the emperor, vader watching his sith master make his son cower in fear of the doomed rebellion... BUT sitting idly during his son's torture struck one of his few remaining nerves on a burnt, robotic shell of a body.  Not the pain he was used to experiencing in physical form, but a deeper remorse for the years spent brooding and wallowing in his own self-loathing--drunk with power.  All to watch his son be brutally murdered? \n\nLuke wanted to be like his father BECAUSE he must have known that if a boy on tatooine could become a powerful jedi, the maybe luke could hope to join the rebellion.  \n\nHe could NOT have done it without luke, or padme.  He was naive the first time and lost his wife, and he was similarly thickskulled the second time knowing lightning spelled certain death in his condition.  Anakin overthrew two SOCIETIES out of love for his family (1st the republic, 2nd the empire).  Whether he was dark or light, Anakin Skywalker fulfilled the prophecy, not in the way it was intended by the jedi, nor an age of darkness like the emperor had forseen. He did it HIS way, because the little slave boy-turned sith lord from the outer rim knew only of conflict, power struggles, poverty, and his mother's love.  His conscience came at a cost, a feeling unknown to most detached jedi.  \n\nSelling his soul to his trusted mentor, having his body butchered by his father figure/brother/master, losing his wife, kept in the dark about his children, are but a fraction of the ordeals Anakin has gone through.  He fought in the Clone Wars. HE was a hero, but he betrayed himself and sacrificed literally everything he had to keep his family safe (albeit with subpar judgment).  \n\n\ntl;dr Anakin is my favorite, Luke will always stand in his shadow.

But when you're in a situation where your wife is dying suddenly in childbirth, she and you are aware of it because of force visions, you are the youngest council member in the history of the jedi but no one trusts you, and your mentor/last hope of saving her demands ending a war and the jedi simultaneously his emotional breakdown is candid.  \n\nHe ended the clone wars. That DEFINITELY saved more lives galaxy-wide then the handful of jedi he murdered in cold blood.  It was brutal, but effective.  That's what a tragic hero does.  A fairy tale hero saves everyone and everything (villains too), and the world goes back to normal.  \n\nDuped by the palpatine yet again, hearing his wife perished because he was busy getting his limbs chopped off, I'm sure vader had only anger left as individual expression. \n\nIn the star wars galaxy, we know (by formula) what anger leads too.  \n\nWith the empires rise he is now the most feared and most powerful individual second only to his master, for whom he does his bidding.  He has no pride or self-esteem left (because the jedi lied to him, and he was deceived by palpatine).  He has no compassion or joy after losing his wife.  His only satisfaction comes from others suffering now, swearing he's never going to be naive about the universe again (just to trick himself into believing that what he does for the empire benefits the galaxy).  \n\nLearning of his children is why luke is so important.  The 'last' willing jedi confronts him, but he CANNOT KILL HIM. He hesitates to strike down a jedi after having murdered hundreds, even thousands of them.  All he had to do was kill one more, but Luke is family.  Darth vader finds the last grain of compassion to ask luke to join him and destroy the emperor, but Luke acts sensibly and flees.  Vader ALLOWS luke and company entry into endor.  A simple gesture taunting his son, almost playful considering the full extent of his wrath. \n\nLuke takes the bait to change things, vader trolls some more.  He's enjoying the first heart to heart with family in a LONG time. Vader provokes Luke, says he'll turn Leia to the dark side, and fails to kill him again-- only to learn a raging luke, drawing from the dark side as the former jedi knight anakin once did, was an early sign of heading down the dark path.  Luke doesn't take the bait this time and goes lays down his lightsaber at the hands of the sith rulers of the galaxy. \n\nHe has yet another choice.  Yet circumstance has polarized the outcome.  If I save my family now, it means the tyranny of the empire will be dissolved from the highest tier down to the last storm trooper.  So he takes the equivalent of a lethal dose of lightning and kills his master in the process to save his son AND the galaxy.  \n\nHe is definitely a brat as a child and an apprentice.  He is definitely a murderer.  But he is also an unspoken, lonesome, and tragic hero at the end of his life.  He lived a lie for half of his life, and then subjected entire planets to his wrath and commited genocide of the jedi.  He died WITH regrets, but he died happy, knowing he left the world as the man who failed and failed again but succeeded in keeping his loved ones alive.  \n   \n\ntl;dr don't look at the tree (younglings) look at the forest (post-clone war/galactic empire and post-emperor's death)", "id": "daonk1j"}, {"comment": "We'll agree to disagree all of this makes him a tragic character I agree on that.

The Emperor wanted Luke destroyed, but Vader wanted to recruit him so they could rule together as father and son. Because living his life with his family is all he wanted.\n\nEven in ROTJ when Luke tries to bring his father back to the light, Vader sighs \"It is too late for me, my son.\" You can hear the despair in his robotic voice.

Sure, he was flawed, but there are many reasons behind that. \n\nThen yes, he fell to the dark side and was seduced and corrupted by Palpatine's poisonous words. He committed atrocities and murdered many, many people. INCLUDING many Emperial officers and soldiers. See, by the time we see him in the OT, he wasn't so much motivaded by Palpatine or Imperial ideals, but by his own guilt and self pity. He knew he had become the most powerful Jedi ever, like he always wanted. But for what? His best friend was now his worst enemy, his mother, who he inteded to free as soon as he became a full fledged Jedi, was  dead. The Jedi order, who taught him everything he knew about the force and politics and life in general, he helped destroy. And more than any of that, he lost his wife and kids to his own poor judgement.\n\nAll because of Palpatine. It is blatantly obvious that he still fears Palpatine a great deal, all the way until that final moment where he decides to save Luke from him. \n\nThat moment in RotJ, where Luke is being electrocuted, Vader stands there looking to Palpatine, then to his son, and back and forth for a few intense seconds. In that moment, he didn't decide to JUST save Luke. He sees himself on the floor being shocked. What was happening to Luke is what would have happened to Anakin if he had tried to save Windu and rejected Palpatine all those years ago. That was when he realized that as a person, his son was far stronger a person than he himself was. He allowed himself to be corrupted. In his journey to save Padme and make himself stronger, he ended up killing not only Padme, but thousands of others. He decided he needed to be powerful with the force and cast out everyone else, including his best friend. \n\nThey key difference with Luke, the one he sees that changes him, is that Luke was willing to die to resist the Emporer, the dark side, and to buy the people he loved just a little more time to complete their mission. Anakin chose the opposite. Seeing his flesh and blood endure that kind of suffering selflessly made him realize how strong he could be. \n\nSo, he rejects 20+ years of brainwashing and indoctrination and throws the Emperor down a pit. That act alone ended the Sith, as he knew Palpatine's lightning would shut down his suit's life support systems. Ending the Empire in one fell swoop. Imagine how many lives he potentially saved with that one act? It wasn't just Luke's. \n\nSo yeah, he did a lot of bad shit, but before that he was a hero.

I think the closest analogue for his character is not Palpatine in TPM, but rather the Emperor in ESB (I know they're the same person, go with me here). When we meet the Emperor in ESB, we don't know anything about him, he's just a floating head. We don't see him in the flesh until ROTJ, and we don't actually understand his backstory and motivations until the end of the Prequels. We actually know *more* about Snoke from the first film with him than we knew about the Emperor.\n\nThat's a good point. But we don't really \"learn\" anything about him in RotJ. We just get to see what he's like more. Also, \"Emperor\" is a little more self explanatory. \n\nIt could be that there's nothing really to even reveal about Snoke, but they seemed to imply that there is.

But I think TFA is an incredibly compelling film that is actually enriched by the mystery it left behind. And as a Star Wars fan this means hours and hours of fun speculation and theories to discuss, and potentially more spin off stories in television or literature to explain what has yet to be explained. I think Star Wars as a film saga is deeply connected to all the other mediums that flesh out the galaxy and canon, and in that regard, I think the Force Awakens had to set up an enormous amount to be expanded upon in mediums other than film now that nearly all of the EU is not canon.\n\nMy biggest problem is that the PT (love them or hate them) gave us such an incredibly new world to look at. The dynamics of everyday life were so different, we got a glimpse at cities and plenty of new and interesting planets and aliens and aesthetics. TFA had a fairly consistent \"newish\" look, but I think it tried too much to look like the OT. Things don't seem that much different than they did in the OT. But in actuality they are. There is a Galactic Republic fighting a war with remnants of the Empire, it's actually closer to the balance we saw during the Clone Wars.

Do you think he's not depicted as her mentor? Or are you just choosing to interpret the movie differently?\n\nRegarding why Finn's injury is a key character moment: Rey runs from every single confrontation the entire film until the final battle with Kylo Ren. Why does she choose to face him at that moment? First, she's angry he killed Han Solo (her mentor/father figure, as I previously discussed), second, she's seen inside his mind and gained a lot of confidence to face him, and third, she just saw him mortally wound her best friend, and the only person who's ever shown that he cares about her. All of these are important elements of Rey's motivation at that moment.\n\nTFA does directly copy many elements from ANH, but most things are usually re-contextualized somehow. For instance, there is an analogous moment to the \"burning homestead\" moment when Luke chooses to join Obi-Wan and study the Force (which you mention), but it doesn't come until very late in the film. Remember, Rey still intends to go back to Jakku until almost the very end of the movie! When Han offers her the job on Takodana, she won't commit, she still intends to return home. After that she gets captured and taken to Starkiller. She's still of the same mindset as Luke even while Kylo Ren holds her prisoner; she's not physically on Jakku, but her heart is still there. I think the moment when she chooses to commit to the Jedi way is actually during the duel, when the \"burning homestead\" music is playing!\n\nThe movie has a lot going on under the surface if you view it openly, just as the prequels do.

In Rebellion you could try crazy tricks that probably even the developers never thought of, it was just that open and permissive. While much more streamlined, EaW felt much more restrictive.\n\nIt's a lot like the difference between the original X-Com and the remake. While they both have great tactical depth, and the modern version far outshines the original in terms of aesthetics, the original is just way more open in terms of what it allows you to do, and almost everything going on is procedurally calculated, whereas in the new version a lot of the content feels predetermined or \"on rails\", so to speak.\n\nGames like the original X-Com or Rebellion are quite rare nowadays unfortunately. Most developers have huge publishers behind them, and huge publishers don't like taking risks, and the open, procedural mechanics of games like these are often seen as a risk.

The missing piece there is the idea of the force awakening.  What I get from that title is that with the academy in ruins and Luke in isolation, the force has been dormant for an extended time.  We know that the force flows through lightside users and in a way uses them to achieve its own will.  In Rey, the force finally has a tool to use and a way to fight back at Kylo and Snoke who have been abusing it and using it for their own twisted will.  So I see Rey's sudden strength in the force as being this explosion of the force through her.  The force finally has an outlet and isn't waiting time.\n\nI think Luke's strength in the force can be seen in a similar light.  Rey seemed to advance more quickly than he did.  But, compare Luke's progress to that of an old school Jedi who trained from childhood and he still advanced quickly.

By this point, the map has switched hands from Lor San Tekka, to Poe, to BB-8. He's also learned that a stormtrooper has just helped this resistance pilot escape the ship. Of course he would be frustrated.\n\n- The second time he takes it out on the interrogation room after Rey has flipped the force back on him and has escaped. He's just come back from speaking with Snoke and Hux. Snoke is clearly disappointed in his lack of progress and Hux is rubbing his incompetence in his face.\n\nThis tells us something about him. Mostly, this isn\u2019t the same as Darth Vader in terms of his anger. He doesn\u2019t destroy in a display of power.

Kylo's internal conflict is even more visible to the audience, pounding on his own injury to inflict pain on himself.  \n\nLuke and Rey were untrained amateurs compared to their opponents, but they both had clarity about who they were and what they were doing.

There's also evidence that Vader was holding back. Here's an exchange from RoTJ where it implies he was holding back during the duel at cloud city.\n\n>\u201cI will not turn\u2014you will be forced to destroy me.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIf that is your destiny.\u201d This was not his wish, but the boy was strong\u2014if it came, at last, to blows, yes, he would destroy Luke. **He could no longer afford to hold back, as he once had.**\n\n-RotJ novel\n\n\nBecause Luke trained over a month on Dagobah and we obviously don't see it all on screen we have no idea if they trained saber, and although I would assume they did that would be pure speculation either way. \n\nAlso Luke was not Vader's match until RoTJ:\n\n>The fight this time was far more balanced. Vader discovered that Luke was his match, and, once again, the Sith Lord found his thoughts straying to an alliance between them against the Emperor.\n\n>Luke had indeed grown powerful since Bespin, and he was an equal match for his father.\n\n\u2013The Official Star Wars Fact File 111", "id": "daqweig"}, {"comment": "Luke kicked Vader's ass in RoTJ.

We see the relationship between Anakin and his mother break in TPM and his attempts to restore it in AotC. Most of Anakin's issues in RotS stem from the loss of his mother. In ANH Luke decides to become a Jedi mostly in an attempt to become closer to the father he never knew. In ESB we see Vader's attempt to restore his relationship with his son.

Both of these parallel Anakin who, when he fell, rejected the Jedi, put on a mask, and became Darth Vader. When he was redeemed he took off the mask and became Anakin again. For all three characters the new name matches with the new identity: Kylo becomes the Master of the Knights of Ren, Finn joins the Resistance which treat their members as individuals rather than as numbers, so he gets a true name, Anakin gets the title Darth when he becomes a Sith and retakes the name Anakin when he becomes a Jedi again.

I was actually considering buying one for Rogue One just for my personal collection, even though I have no use for it.\n\nThe fact that it can be used for premium formats such as 3D or IMAX is a huuuuuge plus.

This is gonna sound like a sales pitch, but I literally gain nothing if you buy this, I'm just a lowly minimum wage student selling tickets. Just wanted to answer a few questions I've seen about this.\n\n\nTLDR: In my opinion, it is definitely worth the money, if I didn't already get in for free, I would definitely purchase it.\n\n\nThis is the second movie we have had this offer for, the first being Batman V Superman. The offer for BvS stated that you could see the movie through some day in September. Of course, we didn't have that movie anymore in September, I'm sure there was some fine print stating that it is good through the date listed or the whenever the movie leaves theaters, whichever comes first. It will obviously be the same for this movie, you won't be able to see Rogue One for six months, TFA only lasted in most theaters through April, and Rogue One is predicted to not do as well.\n\nI had 2 regulars at my theater that had this for BvS. Both of them loved it. I saw them coming in for the movie constantly, analyzing every moment of the movie. They definitely got their money's worth, and then some. Plus, the card was really cool, made of metal and personalized. I was actually considering buying one for Rogue One just for my personal collection, even though I have no use for it.\n\nThe fact that it can be used for premium formats such as 3D or IMAX is a huuuuuge plus. You would only need to see it a few times to get your money's worth out of that.\n\nI personally saw TFA over 10 times in the theaters, and wished I had seen it more. If I didn't already get in for free, I would buy this card in a heartbeat, it's totally worth it.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions, sorry about the wall of text.

It could be similar to some concert venues though. Sometimes you can buy a subscription service which gets you access to all the shows they have in a year.
