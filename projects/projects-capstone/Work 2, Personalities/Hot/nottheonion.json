But they *don't*. \n\nI think part of the problem here, and solely the reason Trump got elected, is the American news cycle is based on controversy, not content. This sort of shit is considered a big scoop, and combined with corporate media's mission to not be \"biased\" (which, except for a handful of people that know what that means, ends up often meaning 100% acritical, which is awful), things fall apart quickly. It inevitably gives, you know, maybe 1%-5% of Americans who harbor these views a disproportionately large percentage of screen time. This *normalizes* it. It takes away shock value every time CNN broadcasts it. And CNN probably thinks it's okay because by showing it people will be naturally disgusted. And obviously many are, at least at first. But the more this sort of stuff is broadcast, if you're racist but not *foaming at the mouth racist* you're going to hear them out, if you're not racist but not anti-racist you're going to tolerate it, and if you're anti-racist you're not going to watch CNN. It shifts the whole discourse to the far-right.\n\nTake, just for example, statistics about how much time the mainstream media gave to Donald Trump's empty podium versus Bernie Sanders during the primary debates. It's subtle and insidious, but ultimately extremely dangerous for democracy as well as for vulnerable or minoritized parts of the population to have a media that functions like this. They should be reporting on white supremacists and neonazis, *yes*, but giving them a platform to speak where the worst that could happen is they get yelled at and booted out is a terrible idea, because you cut out cancer with a scalpel, not a sword.\n\nEdit: words.", "id": "dabptss"}, {"comment": "I was mad at CNN about this and I'll tell you why.\n\nI was mad that this was what they took from the speech and highlighted.

", "id": "dar1373"}, {"comment": "DMV story time. Very long, I've told this one before.\n\nIt all started when I got pulled over by a police officer while I was just about to pull into the movie theatre. I was told I was speeding, I don't think I was, it would have been very difficult to speed on the short amount of road I was on, and there were a bunch of cops at this theatre/mall all the time because of the amount of teenagers that gather on Friday and Saturday nights. I assume it was just to get a chance to pull someone over and run plates. Who knows?  In the process he asked for my proof of insurance to which I pulled out my cell phone and showed it to him on my app. I was told that this was insufficient proof, and that I needed to have my actual proof of insurance as a hard copy. These IDs are kind of new but it's clear as day he's wrong but I don't argue about it too much other than asking him if he's sure. It only costs $10 and having to provide proof of insurance so it's not worth arguing with someone who has the ability to make my life more difficult. This turns out to be a mistake in hindsight. It's currently Jan 3, 2014.\n\nIn the next few days I get a money order and mail in the proof of insurance and don't think about this again until the summer, when I get something in the mail saying my driver's license has been suspended for failing to pay for the ticket. After hours of calls, driving to the court office and the DMV, someone at the court tells me that I had 18 months to pay for this, they weren't sure why it took this long to suspend my license. It clicked immediately that the cop who wrote my ticket must have put down the wrong year when he wrote the ticket because it was only a couple days after the new year when it was written. Sure enough my copy of the ticket showed that he wrote down the wrong day. So I talk to supervisor after supervisor, I've spent a day out of work (I make a lot of money and I can't really miss work) so I'm told the best way to get this done is to just pay the late fee and get my license reinstated. This costs about $200 but I make way more than that a day and I really can't have this issue continuing so I cave and pay for the ticket and get my license re-instated. I think the issue is over. It is not. It's still just beginning.  \n\nSo now it's early December of 2014 and I just got off of a 14 hour shift late at night when I get pulled over. The police officer is very short with me, won't tell me why I'm pulled over. It's a bad neighborhood, I just pulled out of the clinic and we've had police coming by frequently. There was a shooting within the last week. I'm not thinking about the license issue at all, but eventually his partner comes up to my window and asks 'What were you thinking?' I told him I have no idea what he was talking about and he tells me 'You're driving on a suspended license WITH NOTICE. We have to take you in.' I actually screamed at the top of my lungs. I told him there was no fucking way I'm going to jail for something that I paid for TWICE, and I eventually remembered, through my seething anger, that I had proof that I paid everything in the summer. They decide not to arrest me but they still give me a ticket for driving on my suspended license.  \n\nI go back to the DMV the next day and have to take off another day of work. The person who is helping me says that my license was suspended because I showed proof of insurance from 2014 but the ticket was from 2013 so someone saw that and shut it down again. I told them that the people who helped me last time knew that, explained the police officer wrote the wrong year on accident. Didn't matter. For me to get my license reinstated I needed to show them proof from 2013! She told me what papers to ask for from my insurance company to prove this. I write down exactly what she said. I call the insurance company and after an hour I get them faxed to me. I take them back up to the window. She tells me I asked for the wrong papers. I show her what she told me, written down. She denies she said that. I tell her there's no way I made that up on my own. Doesn't matter. I need to ask for a different set of papers. I get the different set of papers sent to me after another hour or so. I show them to her again. She says they aren't signed, we can't accept them. I tell her that she never said they needed to be signed, but apparently they need to be signed by someone at the insurance company. I ask for a supervisor and the supervisor says they aren't allowed to accept it. I call back and get the papers signed but it takes about 3 hours this time. I'm now extremely pissed off. I go back to the window and throw the papers down directly in front of me. She walks over to the police officer who is at the DMV who comes over to me and tells me that he can arrest me for ASSAULT for throwing the papers AT HER! I am now no longer cooperative. I tell them to arrest me and show me a tape where I threw anything at her. She's full of shit and she knows it. She's acting like a bitch because she was wrong. Police officer figures im probably telling the truth but says if I don't calm down I'll still be kicked out anyways. So I walk back to the window and as soon as I get there the girl says 'I'm on lunch now, you have to wait until I get back.' I ask for a supervisor who eventually helps me about half an hour after that, although I do have to wait further when the ID printer breaks while printing my ID. Go fucking figure.\n\nI still have a court date though, because this is such a serious offense. I have to take another day off work. I'm getting nervous because almost everyone else in front of me is getting larger fines, a couple people are sent to jail. Once it's my turn she looks over my paperwork I brought, doesn't even ask for my plea, and says DISMISSED! And apologized! Relief was pretty overwhelming. Not that I should have had to worry but, I shouldn't have had to worry about anything else before this and I actually thought I was cursed at this point.\n\nPoint being, fuck the DMV. I hate them.

Using incorrect terms so that it's unclear whether you mean transitioning as a general thing, which often has different parts or steps for each individual, hormones, or genital surgery.\n\nRLE is an outdated concept that is at most used in systems that are already rectifying it, such as in the NHS, left over from when doctors would rather as few people transition as possible. It's nonsense, it helps no one, and often times makes people feel worse or unsafe. Yes, to some degree it's often required by surgeons for bottom surgeries especially in that before that point most people would have been on hormones for a period of time, and for a certain type of FTM bottom surgery it's required for the surgery. In most countries or for insurances the requirement especially is there for cost saving, to make sure the person remains wanting the surgery after the year or so on hormones.  However, this is not at all the same as the classical RLE of forcing people to go without even hormones to weed out the people that aren't willing to humiliate themselves for the sake of necessary medical care.  Additionally, your view of therapy being to make trans people \"normal\" as the main goal and a last ditch effort if they're still miserable is to transition is fucked up as all hell. That is not at all what therapy is for, nor is that the level of sheer misery one needs to come to to transition.

I can tell by the comments here I'm probably in the minority, but...\n\nThis is in my professional area, and I feel strongly about it. We can all disagree, but I feel obligated to share a different perspective. \n\nThere is absolutely *zero* rigorous empirical evidence that sex reassignment in children or adolescents is more beneficial than other procedures in terms of eventual outcomes. It simply doesn't exist. Pushing for this stuff is the direct result of an attempt by medical community to \"medicalize\" (or maybe, more accurately, \"surgicalize\") perceived standards of care to drive up business. That is, you say \"here's this group that needs help. They need this service that only I am capable of providing. I know because I'm a doctor,\" and then before you know it, they have new business.\n\nThis might seem conspiratorial or something, but I've seen this happen countless times in similar areas within behavioral health, because there is an inherent conflict of interest when the assumed expert evaluators of the effectiveness of a service are the same as the ones who benefit from providing the service. I'm not anti-surgical or biological anything in general, but I am concerned when procedures like this are performed on children with absolutely no data to support it. Importantly, note that I am not saying anything about being trans, or even about peoples' rights to seek surgeries when they are capable of consent. I'm talking specifically about children being counseled into surgical procedures with dramatic consequences when there is no rigorous evidence that it actually is effective.\n\nI've only read the article briefly, so take this with a grain of salt, but it sounds like she is suing health agencies in addition to the child. Also, there's another possible story here that I can see, which goes something like this:\n\nA mother doesn't think sex reassignment surgery is an appropriate treatment for her adolescent child because she sees it as drastic, and sees no real evidence supporting its use. She wants counseling for the child to become comfortable with their gender identity in the absence of surgical reassignment. She denies assignment surgery.\n\nThe child gets pissed and runs away, starts living on their own, supported by health agencies who approach and characterize the mother as providing suboptimal environment for the child due to their differences, and rather than respecting the mother's decision, they characterize it as being medically negligent or something, despite the overwhelming lack of evidence. The child is then emancipated, and the the health agencies then push them toward the treatment they want. Effectively, the mother's decision in this case is ignored by everyone, and she has no recourse but to sue everyone involved. Her parental rights are circumvented by encouraging, one way or another, the child to live independently. \n\nMaybe this isn't what's happening, and this is just some controlling socially conservative authoritarian parent trying to make her child's life difficult out of spite. If so, ignore what I'm saying. But seeing very similar things play out repeatedly, I can see a different story that's not being shared. \n\nBTW, the number of people who regret the surgery is relevant, but not really the question that should be asked. The question is, what would have happen if they didn't have the surgery. Would they actually be better off? That's the question that should be asked, and the way it should be approached. If you look at that data, the effectiveness of reassignment surgery is very questionable. Not ineffective, but definitely risky. \n\nI'm a big believer in letting competent adults decide to do whatever they want, but I don't think that children fall into that class, and regardless, I think that people need to be honest about what empirical evidence is out there and what isn't out there. Right now what I see is the medical community mischaracterizing the scientific evidence in such a way as to take advantage of people in distress to secure a new customer base. \n\n\n\n", "id": "da51yic"}, {"comment": ">This is in my professional area\n\nWhich you won't tell and your posting from a new account.

This one is objectively false.\n\nhttp://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/02/24/peds.2015-3223\n\n>CONCLUSIONS: Socially transitioned transgender children who are supported in their gender identity have developmentally normative levels of depression and only minimal elevations in anxiety, suggesting that psychopathology is not inevitable within this group. **Especially striking is the comparison with reports of children with GID; socially transitioned transgender children have notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among children with GID living as their natal sex.**\n\n", "id": "da5fj49"}, {"comment": "> There is absolutely zero rigorous empirical evidence that sex reassignment in children or adolescents is more beneficial than other procedures in terms of eventual outcomes. It simply doesn't exist. \n\nThe [largest and longest study regarding this subject](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016885) found that transitioning does result in a decreased suicide rate. [Other](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19473181), small[ studies,](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22145968) find that transitioning decreases dysphoria and increases satisfaction with life. There is far from zero empirical evidence. In fact, there is so much empirical evidence, that [transitioning is the recommended treatment given by the APA.](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) But I'm sure that since you're a professional, you know that well enough.\n\n> Pushing for this stuff is the direct result of an attempt by medical community to \"medicalize\" (or maybe, more accurately, \"surgicalize\") perceived standards of care to drive up business. That is, you say \"here's this group that needs help. They need this service that only I am capable of providing. I know because I'm a doctor,\" and then before you know it, they have new business.\n\nThat's a very bold claim. One that I would love to see some evidence for. It would be very surprising to me if big pharma conspired to give a fake medical treatment in an attempt to draw profit from less than 1% of the population. Surely there's other people out there that make easier, more numerous targets.\n\n> A mother doesn't think sex reassignment surgery is an appropriate treatment for her adolescent child because she sees it as drastic, and sees no real evidence supporting its use. She wants counseling for the child to become comfortable with their gender identity in the absence of surgical reassignment. She denies assignment surgery.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to call you out on your bullshit. You are not a professional, you are not a psychologist. If you were, you would know that most places require the counseling you claim should be a necessity before giving any sort of physical treatment. But clearly, you don't. \n\n> BTW, the number of people who regret the surgery is relevant, but not really the question that should be asked. The question is, what would have happen if they didn't have the surgery. Would they actually be better off?\n\nConsidering that the suicide rate is higher for them if they don't, no, no they would not be better off.\n\n > If you look at that data, the effectiveness of reassignment surgery is very questionable. Not ineffective, but definitely risky.\n\nIt'd be nice if you could cite some of this data for us. That is, if you actually have any of it in your possession.\n\n", "id": "da5c54f"}], [{"comment": "LOL.

I mean, I can actually think of a bunch of good reasons to go to N.Korea and if you told me those reasons overrode my one reason - yeah, I buy that.  I am cool with that.\n\nWhat I have read about N.Korea is that they are ALWAYS on the verge of starvation.  They have a military first policy.  Anything that comes into the country the military has first dibs on.  Theoretically serving in the military should get you fed.  Even that is not true.  Eating is a real problem in N.Korea.\n\nSo what I have read about tourism is apparently they feed the tourists well.  How fucked up would that be?  Someone is serving a single meal to yourself and you know damned well the person serving you could make that single meal feed her family for a day.\n\nI think the only way I could visit N.Korea is if I promised myself I wouldn't eat.  But that presents problems too.  The real answer is just to never go.", "id": "da2wjft"}, {"comment": "The countryside is pretty, but many people have pointed out one thing.

You are getting presented a show.  To see the genuine N.Korea isn't likely to happen.  To do that you are going to have to take some risks - and potentially put innocent N.Koreans at risk too.  I have read stories about people that have snuck away from there appointed guides.  I always thought that too balls.  I have also read stories about people that have been busted doing stupid shit and ended up confined to there hotel rooms.  Those people got off lucky.\n\nNumber 2 is where the money from tourism is going.  That money, every damned cent, is going to the military.  All of it.  If you are gonna go you need to make peace with that.  You going to N.Korea is not going to help feed people, or create jobs for the locals.  \n\nNumber 3 is the ramifications of doing stupid shit.  That college aged kid that stole the banner last year is currently in a hard labor camp.  It probably won't happen to you, but it has happened.  It really isn't in N.Korea's best interest to prosecute tourists.

But it's hardly a generation.", "id": "danufqm"}, {"comment": "Idk, personal anecdote, I don't think I was ever addicted to porn(I wasn't like you know, CRAVING to blow off work or studying or putting stuff off to watch it but i definitly could binge masterbated, I found out a way to ejacualte multiple times without even being fully hard), but I definitely Pavloved my dick to it. \n\nI didn't have my first kiss until 21(drunk in a bar, YAH alcohol!) and didn't have first sexual experience until 23(me doing stuff to a girl, she didn't do any reciprocation but details for a different day I guess). \n\nSo basically let's estimate that I jerked it to internet porn vids daily for about 8 or 9 years before any sort of real life sexual experience. Then about a month before college ends and everyone goes their separate ways me and this other girl basically start being friends with benefits(and sleeping over almost daily because there was only like a month and a half worth of classes left), only thing is we never had just straight up sex and I never came because I couldn't get hard enough basically(not gonna complain though, I enjoyed the cuddles and it forced me to learn how to use my hands and mouth). \n\nIt took about two weeks before she could even touch me because it was waaaaaaay too ticklish to be enjoyable, it was like my dick was going \"WHHOOOOOh boy, not normal! something's wrong dude! intruder intruder\", and it wasn't performance anxiety[(And I know what anxiety feels like, honest to god didn't feel any kind of pressure to from her or myself)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjQMJ8fvQe4), me and her basically spent every time together with the attitude of  \"hey if it gets up it gets up and if not no biggie just cuddles\". \n\nBut after that month and a half that's when it kinda hit me that I'm a 23 year old guy, no outstanding health issues, in pretty good shape(not an olympian but but I went for 6m runs every other day on top of other exercises), and I was having a problem that affects 50 year olds but I put it out of my mind, I had school n shit to take care of.  \n\nFast forward about a month and a half in summer, I and a girl start seeing each other, third time seeing each other SHE can't get me hard(I belive experience with other girl let me get past the \"ticklish\" stage faster since I had something to draw from). She(after about 2months of consistently sleeping with each other every other night if not more) finally gets me to cum but still no intercourse because I still wouldn't be hard enough to even put the condom on.\n\nHonestly at this point I was starting to question whether or not if I was gay, I mean hey if you're dick basically failed on you enough times when you try to have sex with women and you're a virgin you start thinking stuff too. Finally force me to admit the fact that I have some form of ED. \n\nLooked around the internet, tried some supplements, then found the whole yourbrainonporn thing, and in my head it just kinda clicked. I realized there wasn't a single time that I had jacked off where there wasn't some form of video porn involved, and I didn't remember the last time I had some form of morning wood. So for the most part I decided that i just wasn't gonna use porn anymore and decided on masterbating only when I was naturally hard instead of if I was bored or something. And honestly it's interesting, I'm slowly getting normal erections again(morning wood and NARBS) along with some other details I won't bother you with.\n\nBut yeah, for me, I don't really think there was a point that I was ever addicted in a classical sense, but there was definitely a point where it came back and bit me in the ass because I was conditioned to it.", "id": "daoalmu"}, {"comment": "I'm not a professional, so I could be totally wrong.\n\nWhat you have is like you said, you accidentally conditioned yourself.

An accidental conditioning like this should be able to be reversed a lot easier than porn addiction. Tell your girlfriend to work with you. Stop watching porn an masturbating (for now, once you've corrected it shouldn't matter unless you do develop an addiction).

And if you can show me that spending $30K/year for 20 years is a net gain to society, I might be a bit more receptive to these types of harsh penalties.\n\nBut there's an implicit loss that goes with having someone incarcerated. [Look at this study from 2005 on the cost of meth to society.](http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9438/index1.html) At first glance you can do the math and see that meth use costs society between $20-50k per year per user. (Yes, I know it's outdated. Best I could find on short notice, but it's useful for demonstrative purposes.)\n\nBut look again at the cost categories. The biggest costs are the intangible costs, i.e., the loss of productivity. This accounts for about 70% of the estimated cost to society. \n\nWhen we put a person in prison, we incur that cost as well. So, once that's factored out, it's a net loss to society to keep a meth addict in prison. Of course, that's no reason to legalize meth, I'm not suggesting that. All I'm suggesting is that 20 years is a really long time. It's expensive. It almost guarantees that this person will never be a productive member of society. Might be worth asking what other alternatives exist.

That deterrent effect is the dominant concern for most crimes, I believe -- we don't want to try to stop people from committing *more* murders after the first, but to not murder anyone at all in the first place.\n\n* I'm assuming that the guy was considered to be a dealer (i.e. the quantity was large enough that he was supplying others).

It doesn't allow administration to use subjective reasoning based on unique circumstances. For example, nail clippers might be okay if the circumstances were such that someone just happened to have them on their key chain. Alternatively, they would not be okay if they were found with a student who had verbally threatened to stab another student and had a history of trying to push the limits by first bringing in a sword, then a machete, then a large knife and then a pocket knife. Discipline could even be issued to both students but differing disciplines would be justified if only because an analysis of the circumstances would show the necessity for it.\n\nAlternatively, in some regions of the country hunting (and hunting safety) is very common. Teens are often known to drive around town with guns in their pick up truck's gun rack without any semblance of concern. Here's two scenarios: (A) student without a history of violence simply forgot to remove his gun after a weekend hunting trip with his parents before going to school\n(B) student who has a history of violence, is in a gang, is fighting another student and in the heat of the moment ran to his car where it was discovered that he happened to have a gun and a gang-member bandana hidden in his glove box. These are obviouly not equivalent scenarios and should be treated different as such. Again, discipline could even be issued to both students but differing disciplines would be justified if only because an analysis of the circumstances would show the necessity for it. Unfortunately, one-size-fits-all policies simply don't allow for that.\n\nIf certain ethnic groups happen to be disproportionately affected as compared to others, it could be because different ethnic groups have cultures that make them more statistically prone to violence. By simply accepting this fact, we can address the root of the problem which is a cultural one. It's often assumed that by accepting the notion that there is increased propensity for violence within certain ethnic groups is racist because it assumes that race is the cause.

He was right that the government is spying on us, and recording all our calls and e-mails. He was pretty much dead right about the NSA as an organization. He was right that the globalist elite are consolidating political power away from the working populations of nation states. He was right that police are militarizing in a worrying trend across the country. These are real things that need real solutions, and Alex should receive credit where credit is due for discussing this. Even a broken clock can be right twice a day. \n\nThe only reason I'm hesitant to totally disregard Alex Jones is because he was making these accurate claims far before anyone else with a similar media presence was (although how much of this was informed speculation versus paranoid ranting that just happens to be true, I don't know).

When Sewol happened Park could not be reached for 7 hours, only to emerge with her hairs messy and unprepared. It was a middle of the day and during work hours so there's no reason she would be unkempt. At the time it was huge scandal but the administration ignored it and made sure the media/newspapers/political organizations under her influence ignore it. This is recently revealed to be one of her cosmetic/drug/sex sessions she was receiving illegally at the Blue House, but the facts aren't fully clear on which.\n\n2 The disaster handling. As the ship sank many of the teachers escaped first, forcing their students to remain in the boat. The naval police did not attempt rescue and circled the ferry around for hours as it sank. Many third-parties attempted to help but they were turned away by the police, including a US naval ship who offered to help. When students started to jump off the ship the police hesitantly picked them up one by one, and at least 1 officer was heard swearing at a student for surviving. Immediately following the disaster the recovery attempt was near nil. They had no diving capability, recovery capability or anything, so they contracted local divers to do their job, but with such poor organizations the divers were feinting from exhaustion and blood clots.\n\n3 The aftermath of Sewol and harassment of victim's families. Park made sure to keep people silent and scared, using harassment tactics on any protests and organizations. Some of these include:\n\n- Sending spies to listen in on the family meetings and trying to muddy the water creating conflicts within the organization. When found out they would hastely disappear and another one would join.\n- Protest crackdown. Using police force to forcibly remove installations, using water canons on victim's families, arresting people randomly for false reasons.\n- Paid counter-protesters. When victim's families hold a hunger strike/protest these counter protesters would be sent to eat pizza/chickens in front of starving families, as well as taunting them while at it.\n- Support crackdown. Anyone remotely famous who express their sympathy for the victims were blacklisted for it, and any corporations/organizations under park's influence obliged and boycotted the blacklisted people.\n- Media manipulation. They painted the victim's families as greedy, as if they were wanting to get paid more. Or trying to create a narrative that 'what's happened is done and done and life must go on.'\n\n4 Aftermath coverup. The scene of ferry disaster remains off-limits to civilians and anything that is recovered from it is swiftly carried off by the naval police. All the phone recordings that was made by the dying students remain classified to the parents of the students. The parents have opted to putting tents down in the nearest island and using a telescope to survey the area.\nNo possessions have been released to the parents to this day and they remain off-limits to anyone.\n\nThese ive listed are only scratching the surface as I'm going by the memory.

The contents of the coffee can had to include a smallish sheet of plastic for use in a shelter and fire starting material (no lighters!).

Wimps just went to a local campground and slept in tents. \n\nMost of the semester there were lessons in science classes on hypothermia and local food sources.

Sit on the saddle and just scoot along, taking longer and longer scoots until you feel confident enough to put one foot on the pedal. Then try both feet, if just for a second or two, then try both with a bit of pedalling, knowing you can go back to scooting anytime you feel shaky, and then finally try cornering with both feet on.\n\nAfter a while, hopefully you will have taught yourself to ride a bike. \n\nThe other thing that's probably helpful is just knowing how a bike works - i.e. how it stays upright and why you don't need to feel worried about lateral instability.

So a left-leaning paper to balance right-leaning WSJ; could've used NYT but that's NY based also, so went for geog & idealogical contrast)\n\nTBH I haven't followed Euro bailouts because (insert US-centric American joke here).  I know it gets complicated because EU can of worms; I think it's tricky when you're talking official central banks, constant threat of Greece and Spain's (total) collapse & implications for the \u20ac, so balancing acts and many bad options.

However, in the end, there is no regulation that will prevent massive abuse while bankers enjoy the following set of privilege: money creation (see bank of england link) + incorporation (no personal responsibility for the leverage/holes you build into the future) + central bank and government backing + government forces bank debt-notes (electronic or otherwise) to be legal tender (everyone has to accept the bank debt as money, especially to pay taxes and other debts).\n\n\n\n", "id": "da2zkue"}, {"comment": "Thanks!

Looking into fringier results like the ones you mentioned (and zerohedge which has some great stuff if you ignore the political posters, never trade based on ZH btw), it seems like they merely build on that simple fact and its consequences.

The car in front of me is going 70 in the fast lane, which is still passing cars going 65 in the slow lane, so my car goes 70 and keeps a constant safe distance between us.\n\nNow the driver behind me wants to go faster, looks ahead of my car, sees the space, and zooms up in the slow lane when he has the chance to get one car ahead.\n\nHe pulls into the space between us and my car detects someone pulling in. I'm now too close so it slows down to compensate for suddenly being too close to the car in front of me until the distance is once again \"safe\" and then speeds back up to match the new leading car.\n\nMeanwhile, the car that is now behind me sees me slowing down, sees that the other guy got in front of me, and also takes the opportunity to zip around me in the slow lane, possibly causing my car to slow down even more before it has had a chance to readjust my speed back up to normal.\n\nAs this goes on, I end up being a driver that is continuously slowing down in the fast lane, causing other drivers to weave back and forth, and not only going much slower than I'd like to go but also being an arguably dangerous obstacle driving in the wrong lane of the highway.\n\nThe end result is that I can't let the car choose the speed and distance in even light traffic because I need to be able to manually speed up and block that guy who wants leap frog cars in order to reach his destination faster.\n\nSo yes, the robot drivers will definitely be bullied by the human drivers and, from my experiences, will actually be inefficient in any traffic conditions so long as they have to make way for humans who are impatient and have less regard for road safety.\n\n**Edit:** well this got more controversial than I expected.

The car in front of me is going 70 in the fast lane, which is still passing cars going 65 in the slow lane, so my car goes 70 and keeps a constant safe distance between us.\n\nNow the driver behind me wants to go faster, looks ahead of my car, sees the space, and zooms up in the slow lane when he has the chance to get one car ahead.\n\nHe pulls into the space between us and my car detects someone pulling in. I'm now too close so it slows down to compensate for suddenly being too close to the car in front of me until the distance is once again \"safe\" and then speeds back up to match the new leading car.\n\nMeanwhile, the car that is now behind me sees me slowing down, sees that the other guy got in front of me, and also takes the opportunity to zip around me in the slow lane, possibly causing my car to slow down even more before it has had a chance to readjust my speed back up to normal.\n\nAs this goes on, I end up being a driver that is continuously slowing down in the fast lane, causing other drivers to weave back and forth, and not only going much slower than I'd like to go but also being an arguably dangerous obstacle driving in the wrong lane of the highway.\n\nThe end result is that I can't let the car choose the speed and distance in even light traffic because I need to be able to manually speed up and block that guy who wants leap frog cars in order to reach his destination faster.\n\nSo yes, the robot drivers will definitely be bullied by the human drivers and, from my experiences, will actually be inefficient in any traffic conditions so long as they have to make way for humans who are impatient and have less regard for road safety.\n\n**Edit:** well this got more controversial than I expected. First, to all the people assuming I'm the unsafe driver, you need to read a bit into the situation here.\n\nThere is a line of cars in both lanes. One is going slow; the other, faster. I want to go even faster but I am patient and realize that passing the car in front of me (using a break in traffic in the slow lane to do so) is not worth my time or effort do I stay in the fast lane and the line of cars once again begins passing the slower drivers soon.\n\nI feel like those of you saying I should move over either don't understand how traffic works, don't understand how people work, or are just assuming I'm talking about there being like 6 cars on the highway.\n\nThere is traffic.

First, there are no fast or slow lanes on a two-lane highway. A two-lane highway literally only has two lanes, one in each direction. Do you mean a four-lane highway, with two lanes on your side and two lanes on the other? That's what it sounds like.\n\nSecond, the fast lane is for *passing*. It's even the law in most states that slower traffic must keep to the right. If you see cars coming up on you who want to overtake you while you're in the left lane, you're obligated to move into the rightmost lane as soon as it's free so they can pass. If cars are constantly moving into the slow lane to pass you, the problem isn't them - it's you.\n\nLastly, most states require a vehicle being overtaken to give way to the overtaking vehicle. If you're speeding up to block someone from getting over, even if they're passing on the right when they shouldn't be, *YOU* are the one driving dangerously. Two wrongs don't make a right, they just get you and who knows how many other people killed in completely preventable crash.\n\nSo you're already traveling in the passing lane when you shouldn't be. On top of that, you're creating an extremely dangerous situation by suddenly speeding up so that the driver who wants to pass you can't get over. Do you really think that unexpectedly moving into someone's blind spot (due to your delusions that you're some kind of \"traffic flow hall monitor\") is really a good idea? Spoiler alert: it's not. \n\nYou seriously need to review your driving manual and your state laws because you're not driving correctly or safely.

That doesn't require forcing yourself at all.\n\n> Some 12 percent of respondents, who were selected from different social and demographic backgrounds, said forced sexual intercourse was acceptable if the victim was \"drunk or on drugs\".\n\nDid they really say that or did they mean sex without given consent?\n\n> The survey also demonstrated that about one in five Europeans hold victim-blaming views, agreeing that women make up or exaggerate their claims about sexual assault.\n\nThat's not victim blaming. Making it up means that they were never a victim to begin with. Victim blaming is a serious problem and it doesn't help when the meaning is diluted like this.\n\nRape is a serious problem that needs to be tackled. However it doesn't help when false information is given or things are exaggerated. That tells people that things aren't as bad as they are made out to be.

You might start [here](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/secession.html) with the 4 declarations regarding the causes of secession issued by seceding states, or with the Vice-President of the Confederacy's [cornerstone speech](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/stephens.html). Or maybe you could just [read what other Confederates were saying](http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/civil-war-overview/why-non-slaveholding.html#).\n\nOr if the Confederates' own words aren't good enough, how about some basic reasoning: why do *you* think it is that all of the states which attempted to secede had more than 20% of their populations as slaves; that no state with more than 20% of the population enslaved attempted to secede; and that secession occurred directly in response to the election of the moderate Republican Abraham Lincoln?\n\nOr if neither reasoning nor evidence helps you, how about math? According to the 1860 US census, among the states which attempted to secede, 30.8% of families owned slaves: according to [the exhaustive study of the Army of Northern Virginia](https://www.amazon.com/General-Lees-Army-Victory-Collapse/dp/1416596976/) performed by historian Joseph Glatthaar, about 10% of the 1861 enlistees personally owned slaves (along with more than half of the officers), and very nearly half either owned slaves or lived in a slaveowning household. And that doesn't count the ones who merely had friends and neighbors who owned slaves; who ran businesses which rented slaves; who made their money by doing business with slaveowners; who aspired to own slaves; or who simply believed that slavery was morally right and liked having someone to feel superior to.\n\n> Do you think with the recent wars the US has been involved in that the people fighting them were the bad guys?\n\nI don't think there has to be only one set of 'bad guys'.

Do science classes teach that there is the theory of gravity and the theory that angels hold our feet to the ground, and leave it at that?  \n  The problem is that religion is so indoctrinated in people, from such a young age, that people often lack the perspective to see just how deeply influenced their thinking is about religion.  \n  It is for these reasons that atheists speak out with loud voices.

Dude can flip prewritten material pretty well...his own Wiki page opens the Career section by referencing he is perhaps best known for sampling Steve Winwood...he IS adept at picking well written (or rather, well known) material. \nThe difference is, back in that day, people like Beethoven wrote music without combining the recordings of others, and this was after meticulous study. Beethoven's father beat him as a child and forced him to practice and study all day, every day, in the hopes of exploiting him in the manner Mozart's father. In the end, the man composed music which is performed daily, the world over, 200 years after his death.\n\nEric Prydz heard good music, and sampled it...comparable to Beethoven? Let us know when he composes a hummable melody with (or - even more difficult, without) sampling. I know that's not the point of EDM, but when one compares a DJ to among the most universal of composers...I think anyone reading might blush in embarrassment of that statement.\n\nHowever, if classical is not a person's 'thing', and one is ignorant to the distinctions between the two genres, I can concede one would not be aware of the limitations and the silliness of that statement. I'm familiar with EDM, and classical - two different mediums meeting two differing psychological ends. \nRest assured, Beethoven's cheeks remain pasty...", "id": "dadxvke"}, {"comment": "His sets are almost purely his music, or artists on his label. \"Call on Me\" was a track even Prydz admits was a mistake.

My post was not belittling the input and outport of any DJ. \nThe difference in perspective is personal. As a musician who has heavy experience in both genres, I can say they each reach to differing ends and crowds (not that it was hard to figure that out). \n\nStrictly compositionally speaking, I have no reservations saying there is no DJ whose music I would anticipate hearing in thousands of forms 200 years from now. First, it would still be a combination of other people's music artistically rearranged; second, it is dependent upon a number of exterior factors to provide the complete experience (lights, volume, holograms, etc); third, a question: can I pick up a guitar or sit at a piano and perform any of a given DJs compositions? If i can do so, then the potential for a universal appeal has far more plausibility. \n\nAs I said - I am not criticizing. I was, however, inspired to offer perspective on the (perhaps) tongue-in-cheek suggestion of Beethoven finding any emotion from EDM! Jokes on his deafness aside, I will (non-humorously) suggest the Beethoven of the late 18th/early 19th century would not be terribly keen on such music. In contrast with Romantic era classical music (which Beethoven directly impacted), EDM lacks dynamic and emotional presentation, control of a musical resource stemming only from within oneself, and a vision for architecture which is a hallmark of Beethoven's compositional output (not simply building up tension and releasing, but development -which is too large a subject to delve into here). NOT to say any given DJ lacks architectural awareness of the form of their craft, but...it is a different genre, so the necessity of as much is not so terribly pressing. \n\nWere Beethoven alive in our day and age, however...(and without his fathers daily bearings)...he just might find a calling as a EDM DJ...", "id": "dae50t2"}, {"comment": "And hummable melodies... \n\nAtlanta to Miami, Mirage, Glimma...

TBH the only professional ethic or code I know well is the US military's.  O/w it's general-knowlege: Dr-patient or lawyer/client privilege, do no harm, etc - but you def face consequences for violating those codes: can face disbarment (law), losing med license, or for military can get busted in rank or even go to jail.  But those profession-governing bodies are strong.  Seems journalism's are far less centralized or powerful.\n\nAvoiding conflicts of interest was in every journalism-ethics code I found, including the big guys: [Society of Professional Journalists](http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp), [Radio/Tv/Digital News Assn](http://rtdna.org/content/rtdna_code_of_ethics), [UNESCO](http://ethicnet.uta.fi/international/international_principles_of_professional_ethics_in_journalism); & also I-don't-know-how-big guys: [Ethical Journalism Network](http://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/who-we-are/5-principles-of-journalism) or [MEAA](https://www.meaa.org/meaa-media/code-of-ethics/)... along w/the common themes of transparency, full disclosure, minimizing harm, maximizing privacy, protecting sources, etc.\n\nSeems the problem (as we've noticed) is enforcement - there's no central licensing body AFAIK  like med/law/military has, so who holds journos accountable when they *do* violate the code by accepting gifts, not paying their own way, not disclosing relationships, etc?  Seems like right now it's public/colleague opinion & the employer.  Some news joints have very clear codes of ethics, like [NPR](http://ethics.npr.org/), and seem to work well.  NYT has a similar [code](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/weblines/4111.html).  Now, **if** the narrative from the leaked email is accurate (keeping in mind we haven't the whole story), and **if** there was  a conflict of interest: those journos should get reprimanded or possibly suspended if not a 1st offense.  IDK enough in this case. (& I have to get back to my night.)  But yes, there are some clearly defined standards to which these guys must hold themselves.  If/when they fail, their profession or employer is supposed to police them.  If not, it's up to us to give informed feedback that we expect better.\n\nOverall I'm cynical; news has gone full postmodern & \"truthiness\" now,  when the fucking NYT (left-leaning but legit) has to compete for clicks with openly skewed sources like Breitbart and *100% fake* outrage-bait on facebook; so IDK how much proper journalism can stand up to the chaos.

Gerrymandering can be fixed ASAP, state by state, if only people would vote to elect the people who propose to fix them.

I know its hard to imagine, it almost seems comic, but from what I saw in Chechnya, after a few months of war... that was most people. \n\nSociopath tendencies can develop into an entire community following mass tragedy.

To say it was religion, or nationalism, or that these murderers actually thought they were doing it in the NAME of something is just ignoring the psychological and dehumanizing effects of war. \n\nI think this also applies to WW2 and the Nazis. A tremendous amount of young German men were horribly traumatized and dehumanized by what they saw during the WW1, and they were willing and ready to commit more atrocities. These young, likely psychopathic men who fought likely saw horrific things, and wanted to continue those horrific things. This is probably why Hitler came to power. Say what you want about Hitlers nationalism, but it likely would have never taken off unless there was an entire young generation which was already exposed and ready to commit bloodshed.

Still, you may find this of use to you in life.\n\nIf everyone is doing what they think is best, what is best? Well, a wise green man once said, \"Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate and hate leads to suffering.\" What is left out from the phrase is \"Ignorance leads to fear.\" For, in the circles from which the latter assertion stems, they find that to find the root of suffering is to, simultaneously, find the root of ignorance.  Therefore, the First interesting point, the First Truth, is that you should know what suffering is. \n\nThat said, this small assertion initiates you into a quest. On this quest, so long as you stay strong and remember that first Truth, you will find three more truths. They are as follows:\n\n2. The truth of the cause of suffering (samudaya)\n3. The truth of the end of suffering (nirhodha)\n4. The truth of the path that frees us from suffering (magga)\n \nThese are the Heart of Buddhas Teachings: The Four Noble Truths. Another interesting fact is that \"The Wings to Awakening\" are likened to the wings of a bird, both needed for flight. One is  Wisdom and the other Compassion, hence why understanding suffering brings the end of ignorance and vice-versa. [The Wings to Awakening also happens to be the title of what is considered to be the primary discourse of the Buddha, titled \"bodhi-pakkhiya-dhamma\" in Pali. ](http://www.urbandharma.org/pdf/wings.pdf)\n\nAnyway, I just thought you might find this of interest.

If hey vote for you they are \"Upholding the Constitution\".  That is what I learned during the gay marriage issue. ", "id": "d9yr9bm"}, {"comment": "I'm happy they made the decision they did, but their logic to do it was shit.\n\nBasically they said the right to marry whoever you want falls under the 14th Amendment's \"equal protection under the laws\" segment. The fist problem, is that the politicians in the 1860s *certainly* did not intend to legalize gay marriage whit their words. So what they intended the law to mean is not what the modern court meant. Take an example; If I wrote a biography and said I bought a watch \"becasue it looked cool\", I clearly mean the word in the modern slang equivalent of \"fashionable\". If someone in 150 years reads the book, they might think I meant \"cool\" as in \"low temperature\". But to do so would completely miss what I meant to communicate about the watch. In the same way, to understand a law's meaning you have to look at what the original writer's intended it to mean. This is what the court did in the Obamacare ruling- they knew what the writers meant, so rightly ignored what he literal text of the law said in favor of the intent. Yet with gay marriage, the intent of the writers was ignored in favor of the literal text. Justice Roberts was one of the few who sided with 'intent\" on both of these cases, which to me makes his dissent the best read regarding the gay marriage ruling\n\nBut most importantly, the modern court pretty much had to say that wanting a gay wedding is the same as being black, or a woman. The 14th was meant to protect people from discrimination about who they are, ie segregation and gender discrimination are not allowed, as they discriminate against people based on who they are.\n\nHowever a progressive tax system is not against the 14th amendment becasue it applies to everyone, even though it winds up affecting some races and genders more than others. Drunk driving laws are also not discriminatory, even though they only affect those who would drive while intoxicated. Gun laws are not discriminatory, even though they only harm people who like guns. A law saying marriage is between a man and woman is not discriminatory, because it affect all people regardless of gender or race or economic status, equally, although like the other laws it only affect certain people. If the marriage laws were \"marriage is between a white man and a white woman\", then that would be discriminatory. If a tax law was \"Asian people must overall pay more of their income than whites do to taxes\", then it would be discriminatory. Yet because the tax system applies to everyone equally, it isn't discriminatory even though it affects some groups more than others.\n\nEven though as a libertarian I do want gay marriage legalized, the logic the court used is off. Read Robert's dissent for a better explanation \n\nEDIT: For the record I'm not a lawyer, so I recommend that you read the majority and dissenting(s) opinions on the case. Or at least look up a left and right wing summation of the 2, and decide for yourself from there. I'm intellectually  honest in my understanding of the case but this topic is contentious, complicated, and not something I'm too keen to argue about so I won't respond much more to anyone", "id": "d9ytdw5"}, {"comment": "The 14th amendment was meant to imply that due process and equal protection under the law applied to everyone.

They obviously understood that their ways and morals would not always be applicable to the country.\n\nSexuality is, in my eyes, something that is as integral to a human being as is race or sex; it is something that cannot be changed by any realistic means; meanwhile, something like income or alcoholism, pertaining to your graduated tax and drunk driving examples, is something that can be changed, and is expected to change; in short, things like race and sexuality are inborn traits, while things like income are developed. This is, to me, what was really in question when the 14th amendment was written; the writers meant to protect people from persecution based on things that are part of them, which sexuality is.\n\nThis is why I support the ruling that the court made, both on the basis of constitutionality, and my own personal views.", "id": "d9yy2ts"}, {"comment": "I don't understand your explanation.\n\n>A law saying marriage is between a man and woman is not discriminatory, because it affect all people regardless of gender or race or economic status, equally\n\nThis seems to suggest that you think things can only be discriminatory based on gender, race, or economic status. Was that intentional?\n\nFrom what I was able to find of Judge Roberts dissent it sounds like his point is that making decisions about the social realm should not be up to the government, or legal system. But this ignores the fact that the government already crossed this boundary by taking sides by legally recognizing some marriages, and not others.\n\nThis is like saying that the government shouldn't have repealed the 21st Amendment because it has no right to dictate what people consume.", "id": "d9yynel"}, {"comment": "All hatred of legislating from the bench goes right out as soon as it gets you what you want.\n\n", "id": "d9yzp5w"}], [{"comment": "I like Ginsburg but aren't the justices suppose to be apolitical?", "id": "d9ys6hh"}, {"comment": "No, they are supposed to be non partisan.", "id": "d9yz452"}, {"comment": "> No, they are supposed to be non partisan.\n\nWhich she is 100% not.", "id": "d9z26ok"}, {"comment": "Neither was Scalia.", "id": "d9z89h3"}, {"comment": "You don't have to be partisan to hate an ass-wipe like Trump.", "id": "d9z4zjz"}, {"comment": "They are supposed to be non-partisan, but just look at their comments on their rulings.

We've repeatedly seen that baiting happen.\n\nNow you have a fear mongering liberal population that is unwilling to take office, a population of elites that STILL can't figure out what's going on, and conservatives that are sort of not really happy with the situation and are themselves very wary of how much power can be wielded by even more extreme arms of the country.\n\nFor me, the issue is that instead of properly fighting this about bad policy, the Democrats immediately threw the race card out.  And ultimately that's the biggest issue with the schism right now.\n\nIt's not wrong for Trump to say that there's an extremist Muslim problem (especially given the state of the Middle East and Syria, which the West has utterly just botched), even if his solution is absolutely batshit stupid and wrong.  But the wrong move is to call out the issue of racism immediately.  It's absolutely fundamentally idiotic to call him a racist on one side of the front page, then on the other side of the same page show a bombing in Europe by an Islamic extremist with a stupidly bold headline.\n\nAnd what we see throughout the world is the SAME FUCKING TACTIC.

I also agree that you have to call out racism, sexism etc while doing the business of politics at the same time. I think a lot of people forget that beating Trump at the next election wil involve knocking on doors and convince people to vote DNC at the next election. If somebody voted Trump because they were annoyed abou their insurance premiums, you fix Obamacare. If somebody is concerned about jobs, you convince them to vote for you because you've got a great economic policy. There were a lot of policy issues that underlined this election and the DNC needs to tackle that.\n\nBUT\n\nwe cannot let the issue of racism slide. If we put that to one side we are done. We are cowards if we can't stand up racism and we betray our value if we let it go. It shouldn't be something we have to cast aside to win elections. You can call out racism and win elections. *race is already a wedge issue* and always has been. It's a wedge issue for people who have to think about it every single day. The conversations we're hearing in the mainstream press these days have been going on behind closed doors, we just didn't pay attention. To cast the issue of race is to betray a large part of our population. Equally, gender matters to women, men, lgbt people etc. We are all defined by our gender and it determines our path in life. The idea that we should just be quiet about it isn't helping anyone. If we can't have these conversations, we're going nowhere. \n\nI suppose my main point is: we can fight racism and call it out while tackling policy issues.

They're not blameless, because if Trump really was only about the economic issues and the plight of the working class, blacks and latinos would have come out for him.\n\nSo *of course* there's a racial component. But a lot of Trump voters aren't racist, or hateful of Muslims. A lot of them are just fed up with the system, and for better or for worse, thought that we would change things (he of course won't and that's another matter to do with disinformation and manipulation through the media), and help save some jobs (he won't do that either).\n\nTrump is a piece of shit but there is this dangerous idea going around that his voters are all going to be defined by the worst of his ideas. \nAnd that's where the name calling starts. But it's not that simple.\nHillary did represent \"more of the same\" and a lot of educated voters chose to overlook Trump's many flaws just to forgo that (the fact that he would be \"more of the same but even worse\" escaped them but again, I mostly blame it on the media).\n\nThey're not innocent of name calling either. In fact, Trump supporters are probably worse at it. But an eye for an eye doesn't help anyone.\n\nLook at it from their flawed, but human perspective: you live in this rural america, raised all your life with conservative values, and unfortunately listen to all this talk radio bullshit, which means in the end you only get one end of the information.\nThe feeling that their values (social) and property (economic) are being assaulted is misguided but needs to be addressed another way than \"hey, don't think that, that's stupid, because you're stupid.\"\n\nI have a colleague at work here in Montreal. He's from Senegal, and he's awesome. He's also a devout Muslim, raised in Dakar suburbs, taught all his life that homosexuals are deviants and sodomy is a sin.\nI don't agree with his views on this but I get why a kid raised like this would develop convictions. I don't judge him for it, because outside of his homophobic tendencies he's also a very good person, and he doesn't advertise his beliefs or harm homosexuals in any way.\n\nAnd in the 2 years I've worked with him, our many discussions on the subject have warmed him up to the idea that being gay is just another part of human nature that gays can't choose. He's become more open.\n\nIt's a slow process, but unlearning convictions taught since grade school and opening yourself to the world is hard. Harder for some people than others.\n\nSo what would calling him a homophobe accomplish? Telling him he's a terrible person for being against gay mariage? \nHe's a good father to his kids, a good husband to his wife, a good friend and a good colleague. So who are we to tell him he's a terrible person?\nThat would just make him pull back and entrench into his convictions.\n\nIt's the same with Trump voters.\n\nI agreed that they were fooled by a con man and a conservative establishment with nothing to lose. But anyone can be.\nThe only way to heal your country is to show people a little bit of empathy *even if they won't show it to you*.\nStupidity you're born with and stuck with.\nHate and ignorance can be cured with love and education (and maybe exposing all these rural folks to some actual Muslims who don't want to bomb them and show them they're normal people).\n\nThat's all I'm saying.\n\nPS: I was guilty of calling them stupid during the election (anyone who goes through my comment history until pretty recently can see this), but with the extent of the defeat, it calls for a questioning of the liberal progressive way of doing politics, because it's obvious part of the message wasn't going through.", "id": "da70595"}, {"comment": "[removed]", "id": "da72yqo"}, {"comment": "When people call me racist, I vote for the massive racist.

Yes, you will get a small percentage that will struggle more, and it would be nice to have a system in place to help them as well (which wasn't there in my school) but I can honestly say that I value the schooling I received even more now that I am in England. The best examples I can give are the fact that many immigrants (not the majority, but consider English is a second language to most migrants)  know how to spell better than British people. That really left me stunned when I realized it. The same with mathematics: I was doing some basic calculations on a piece of paper and everyone was looking at me like I was the next Einstein (In school my marks in maths where about C- level) Also, I notice that the majority of British people have no idea about politics, economics, history etc. Most are completely uninterested and some who do have opinions you realize that their opinions are taken off the front pages of newspapers.\n\nIf I were to put my tin hat on I'd say the system is build to keep the masses at a low level of education, just high enough to get by in their basic jobs, but not any higher so that they question and challenge the ruling class which gets expensive, private education and therefore a much greater chance in life. Add to that the type of TV shows available today (everywhere, not just the UK) that seek nothing more than to attract the most viewers and not to educate and you have yourself a conspiracy. (See Orwell's1984)\n\nAnd the result is a large number of people who were not given the biggest chances in life, who find it hard to function in today's complex world. And who end up behind in raw skills compared to migrants from the rest of the world.\n\n\nI forgot to add that I am form time to time pleasantly surprised when talking to British people who seem to know and care about the world around them. In most cases, though, it's people who I later find out were in private schools.\n\n*Edit: I also meant to mention that even in the eastern countries they have started to move away from the communist type of teaching, and towards the western style of caring about the pupil's feelings first, and actual education second.

Countries with generous parental leave don't have much higher birth rates, Sweden has the most generous parental leave yet they still have almost the same fertility rate as the US. Simply increasing immigration is the best way to solve this problem. \n\nThis is why Germany's government has been so open to taking so many immigrants (beyond the humanitarian and moral reasons). The German government will spend 93 billion euros on refugees over the next five years, but this is an investment that will likely pay out far more than the 93 billion dollars they are paying.

I'm not an expert, but I'm guessing that if couples were given 20 thousand euros to make a kid, the fertility rate would soon reach 2. And if I'm wrong, nothing forbids to allocate more than 20 billions per year.", "id": "da7081q"}, {"comment": "One is guaranteed to work, and brings almost immediate returns.

On top of that being with them a culture that is literally racist, Xenophobic, homophobic, and misogynistic, and even the moderate religious ones are extreme compared to western culture...yet you call people that don't want them here racist white nationists.\n\nIf you're being responsible with your life and money, who do you side with?", "id": "da77nt1"}, {"comment": "First off that would only solve the problem for five years. The amount of money that is being spent on refugees in Germany is not permanent and they will not spend nearly as much money on them after 2020. Instead at that point the average refugee will likely be paying more to Germany in taxes than they receive in benefits. The addition of so many refugees solves the problem of a small fertility rate for far more than five years.\n\nSecondly it has been shown that more generous parental leave packages (which is essentially what you are talking about) do not lead to much higher birth rates. Here is an [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8041774/Child-benefit-how-it-compares-across-the-world.html) that briefly goes over some of my points and lists countries payments to parents. In Germany they pay parents 2,530 Euros *per year*, until the [child turns 18](http://www.howtogermany.com/pages/kindergeld.html). That is already far more than what your proposal pays, yet the German fertility rate is far lower than it is in countries that have far less generous universal child benefit programs (like America). Making it more generous is something that many countries should do because of its other benefits (children of poor parents in countries with these programs tend to do much better in school and life than countries with small or non-existent programs), but it is very ineffective at increasing the birth rate. The reason why fertility rates are low is largely cultural. Rich countries almost always have low fertility rates, and there isn't much we can or should do about that. \n\nAnd lastly, there isn't any reason to implement the kind of program that you are talking about when so many people want to immigrate to countries with low fertility rates. We are solving two problems with on program by allowing them to immigrate.", "id": "da71xod"}, {"comment": "Citizens are not widgets that you can just source from a different supplier.. at least, not without destroying the character of the very country you claim you're trying to protect.", "id": "da741np"}, {"comment": "*Instead at that point the average refugee will likely be paying more to Germany in taxes than they receive in benefits*\nDo you have any good explanation or proof of this? Do you really think most of the refugees are employable in the German economy and the amount of money used to train them, school their children, and provide them healthcare over time isn't going to exceed the cost that most of them will contribute as unskilled laborers? I suspect you might respond, with great optimistic enthusiasm, that there's potential that they will be exceedingly economic productive if you train / educate them for certain jobs or trades, but were those careers really in short-demand pre-Migrate Europe? Was there really a huge demand in most productive economic careers and jobs before this that not enough Germans, immigrants from EU nations, and expats couldn't fulfill? \n\nYou made really well-clear that your proposed intentions for the long-term isn't for humanitarian reasons for them, but apart of trying to improve the economy. With that being so, there's no excuse why they can't be selective with who they bring in. Why not import skilled and professional workers from countries and backgrounds around the world which have high fertility rates, or pledge that they will have a lot of kids while coming to said country, instead of being content with current refugees? \n\nYour economic proposals have no civic forethought that is compatible with the current democratic German society that has a huge social safety net. If you want economic drones just to make contribute to the pension funds of the nation's eldery, you mind as well make the migrants into a servile class that has no access to the same benefits and privileges of German citizens.

Federal election law and the constitution are silent on this, and is generally understood that Electors can vote however they damn well please. State law does NOT control Federal elections. Members of the Electoral College are participating in a Federal Election. So, legally, it doesn't matter if your state wants to fine you, or threaten jail if you, as an Elector, do not vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in your state. Even if it did, after you case your vote, just move to another state and you're cool.\n\nTraditionally, Electors stick to the states choice of popular candidate 99% of the time.\n\nHowever, there have been 185+ Electors who have voted differently than whom their state's top vote-getter candidate over our history. Some wrote in a candidate. Others abstained from voting entirely in protest.\n\nAgain, the Electoral College is the body that ACTUALLY votes in the President. It's set up like that to prevent popular-but-dangerous candidates from ascending to office, and is one more part of our system of checks and balances.\n\nThankfully, we've managed not to use this power of the Electoral College to fundamentally change an outcome, however if ever there was an election whereby the Electoral College SHOULD do so, it would be this one.\n\nClinton absolutely won the popular vote, and her margin grows daily.

My daughter had a gold taken from her this way when she was about 11. She has cerebral palsy that affects her right side. She was competing in the softball throw.  Her particular ability group happened to only have two people--her and another girl. My daughter really wanted to win, so she threw really hard, and set a new distance record for herself. It was also kind of a fluke.  Her form is terrible and random for obvious reasons, and she just kind of managed to swing her arm in the right way for good distance. She knew she had won and was very excited. \n\n\nSo we go to the awards podium and she gets placed on the 4th place spot (participation ribbon) and the other girl on the top at 1st place. We had no idea what was going on. They said she was a rabbit. We explained this to our daughter and focused on helping her be proud of her personal improvement, but she was still devastated.

The term has multiple uses, such as a driver who competes in an event in a series below their level of expertise to finish high. In bracket drag racing and short track racing when a racer has a dial-in time / qualifying speed much slower than the car can actually perform. The term can also be used to describe a fast driver who holds back during a race until just before the end, when they suddenly pass up through the field to win the event.\n\nMore info of \"why?\"\n\nDrag racing  \nThe function of sandbagging is to guarantee a win by outperforming the slower opponent at first, and then hitting the brakes near the finish line in time to just barely beat the opponent. However, sandbaggers run the risk of beating their dial-in time, thus disqualifying them from the race. Sandbaggers must be experienced in controlling this technique, and therefore, it should not be attempted by beginners. Sandbagging faces much criticism, as many argue that it is essentially cheating. Television shows such as Pinks and bracket racing rules discourage sandbagging by creating automatic disqualification for breakouts. However, if both cars run faster than their dial-in time, the car that runs faster by the least amount is the winner.\n\nExample  \nRacer A has a car that consistently runs a quarter-mile drag race in 12 seconds. Racer A gives a dial-in time of 15 seconds, therefore claiming that the car is 3 seconds slower than it actually is. Racer A goes against Racer B in an E.T. bracket race. In bracket races, both racers are supposedly equal since both have similar times. However, Racer B has an accurate dial-in time of 15 seconds while Racer A has an inaccurate dial-in time that gives Racer A the advantage. During the race, Racer A gets a clear advantage off the starting line. But to not be disqualified by racing faster than the dial-in time, Racer A slows near the finish line to just barely beat Racer B.", "id": "daisawy"}, {"comment": "Or he didn't take it seriously and it benefited him. 15% is a lot faster, impossible to train to that improvement in the timeframe.

Dogs are quite quick to learn that they can ignore certain commands (first/second, maybe different tone). Many people actually train their dogs that they don't need to actively listen, because the owner will do all the work to get the dog's attention. Repeating commands, for example, teaches a dog that it's not necessary to respond/listen the first time.\n\nDiscrimination training is the term used for teaching/learning differences between stimuli (e.g., for humans, learning the difference between wake/woke). If there isn't any serious benefit to learning a difference, most organisms will ignore it. This applies to the majority of stimuli in your life, as you wish to spend time/energy on more important things. This applies to animals. E.g., if a field of red berries and magenta berries taste equally good and are equally nutritious, the animal will not bother to remember which is which. But, if one tastes good and the other awful, or if one is harmful, an intelligent animal will, very quickly, learn to discern the two apart. Applying that, if a dog sitting on the first command is reinforced similarly to sitting on the second/third command, the dog won't put much energy into focusing on the first. After all, it knows it will get more chances. Similar, a smart/stubborn dog may resist commands from an unfamiliar or younger human--some dogs know that strangers have a lower threshold for satisfaction of dog obedience, and they will thus resist/ignore more of their commands. \n\nExpanding on that, if you always alert your dog when to listen to you (whether by tone of voice, calling their name, etc.), they will learn that nothing of benefit happens without that signal (this is called a discriminatory stimulus). They can also learn that only the next few words you might say will benefit them. So they may not respond, even if you talk straight at them, because they haven't heard the 'signal'. Having a clear signal can be helpful for many dogs, particularly those that may struggle with attention/still learning/prone to neurosis/etc., but it would be highly impractical for work/service/military dogs. Such dogs learn to pay attention for extended amounts of time, listening to extensive speech, because they are waiting for something they understand/should respond to. \n\nSorry to go on such a long tangent, I just see so many common misconceptions about animal behavior (especially dogs!) on reddit, so I thought I'd share what I know. I'm not a canine behaviorist, I am more familiar with human neuropsych, but there is overlap and I am involved with a lot of training (I have a neuro service animal for my disability).

I specialized in human neuropsych, but that requires learning/understanding many animal processing mechanisms as well. However, someone correct me if more recent research contradicts my education.\n\nIf intelligent animals could only learn sounds, it would be necessary to say commands with impossibly accurate pitch, tone, and timber each time. They would not be able to understand the commands between male and female communicators. However, animals actually are capable of learning human language sound components (termed phonemes). \n\nPhonemes have unique value in sounds, and while humans have more expansive verbal language centers, intelligent animals can also develop neural resources for processing phonemes. It is partially why socialized animals can recognize words as uniquely more valuable than other common sounds (pay attention when a human speaks). An animal can't understand heavy accents as quickly as a human, because it cannot use syntax clues to discern word meaning. But it *can* learn the adjusted phoneme set through regular exposure to words it is already familiar with. With enough exposure, an animal can expand its phoneme set to account for the experienced accent (just like humans).", "id": "da516w1"}, {"comment": ">I don't know the specifics about pandas, but other animals don't recognize the word, they recognize the sound. \n\n\nBut...

I WONDER WHY."], [270, "On a related note the government sent me this bs email on why they don't care about the petition that was meant to repeal the law:\nDear lightningbadger,\n\nThe Government has responded to the petition you signed \u2013 \u201cRepeal the new Surveillance laws (Investigatory Powers Act)\u201d.\n\nGovernment responded:\n\nThe Investigatory Powers Act dramatically increases transparency around the use of investigatory powers. It protects both privacy and security and underwent unprecedented scrutiny before becoming law.\n\nThe Government is clear that, at a time of heightened security threat, it is essential our law enforcement, security and intelligence services have the powers they need to keep people safe.\n\nThe Investigatory Powers Act transforms the law relating to the use and oversight of Investigatory powers. It strengthens safeguards and introduces world-leading oversight arrangements.\n\nThe Act does three key things. First, it brings together powers already available to law enforcement and the security and intelligence agencies to obtain communications and data about communications. It makes these powers \u2013 and the safeguards that apply to them \u2013 clear and understandable.\n\nSecond, it radically overhauls the way these powers are authorised and overseen. It introduces a \u2018double-lock\u2019 for the most intrusive powers, including interception and all of the bulk capabilities, so warrants require the approval of a Judicial Commissioner. And it creates a powerful new Investigatory Powers Commissioner to oversee how these powers are used.\n\nThird, it ensures powers are fit for the digital age. The Act makes a single new provision for the retention of internet connection records in order for law enforcement to identify the communications service to which a device has connected. This will restore capabilities that have been lost as a result of changes in the way people communicate.\n\nPublic scrutiny\n\nThe Bill was subject to unprecedented scrutiny prior to and during its passage. \nThe Bill responded to three independent reports: by David Anderson QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation; by the Royal United Services Institute\u2019s Independent Surveillance Review Panel; and by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament. All three of those authoritative independent reports agreed a new law was needed. \n\nThe Government responded to the recommendations of those reports in the form of a draft Bill, published in November 2015. That draft Bill was submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament. The Intelligence and Security Committee and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee conducted parallel scrutiny. Between them, those Committees received over 1,500 pages of written submissions and heard oral evidence from the Government, industry, civil liberties groups and many others. The recommendations made by those Committees informed changes to the Bill and the publication of further supporting material.\n\nA revised Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 1 March, and completed its passage on 16 November, meeting the timetable for legislation set by Parliament during the passage of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014. Over 1,700 amendments to the Bill were tabled and debated during this time.\n\nThe Government has adopted an open and consultative approach throughout the passage of this legislation, tabling or accepting a significant number of amendments in both Houses of Parliament in order to improve transparency and strengthen privacy protections. These included enhanced protections for trade unions and journalistic and legally privileged material, and the introduction of a threshold to ensure internet connection records cannot be used to investigate minor crimes.\n\nPrivacy and Oversight\n\nThe Government has placed privacy at the heart of the Investigatory Powers Act. The Act makes clear the extent to which investigatory powers may be used and the strict safeguards that apply in order to maintain privacy.\n\nA new overarching \u2018privacy clause\u2019 was added to make absolutely clear that the protection of privacy is at the heart of this legislation. This privacy clause ensures that in each and every case a public authority must consider whether less intrusive means could be used, and must have regard to human rights and the particular sensitivity of certain information. The powers can only be exercised when it is necessary and proportionate to do so, and the Act includes tough sanctions \u2013 including the creation of new criminal offences \u2013 for those misusing the powers. \nThe safeguards in this Act reflect the UK\u2019s international reputation for protecting human rights. The unprecedented transparency and the new safeguards \u2013 including the \u2018double lock\u2019 for the most sensitive powers \u2013 set an international benchmark for how the law can protect both privacy and security. \n\nHome Office\n\nClick this link to view the response online:\n\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/173199?reveal_response=yes\n\nThis petition has over 100,000 signatures.

It protects both privacy and security and underwent unprecedented scrutiny before becoming law.\n\nThe Government is clear that, at a time of heightened security threat, it is essential our law enforcement, security and intelligence services have the powers they need to keep people safe.\n\nThe Investigatory Powers Act transforms the law relating to the use and oversight of Investigatory powers. It strengthens safeguards and introduces world-leading oversight arrangements.\n\nThe Act does three key things. First, it brings together powers already available to law enforcement and the security and intelligence agencies to obtain communications and data about communications. It makes these powers \u2013 and the safeguards that apply to them \u2013 clear and understandable.\n\nSecond, it radically overhauls the way these powers are authorised and overseen. It introduces a \u2018double-lock\u2019 for the most intrusive powers, including interception and all of the bulk capabilities, so warrants require the approval of a Judicial Commissioner. And it creates a powerful new Investigatory Powers Commissioner to oversee how these powers are used.\n\nThird, it ensures powers are fit for the digital age. The Act makes a single new provision for the retention of internet connection records in order for law enforcement to identify the communications service to which a device has connected. This will restore capabilities that have been lost as a result of changes in the way people communicate.\n\nPublic scrutiny\n\nThe Bill was subject to unprecedented scrutiny prior to and during its passage. \nThe Bill responded to three independent reports: by David Anderson QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation; by the Royal United Services Institute\u2019s Independent Surveillance Review Panel; and by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament. All three of those authoritative independent reports agreed a new law was needed. \n\nThe Government responded to the recommendations of those reports in the form of a draft Bill, published in November 2015. That draft Bill was submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament. The Intelligence and Security Committee and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee conducted parallel scrutiny. Between them, those Committees received over 1,500 pages of written submissions and heard oral evidence from the Government, industry, civil liberties groups and many others. The recommendations made by those Committees informed changes to the Bill and the publication of further supporting material.\n\nA revised Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 1 March, and completed its passage on 16 November, meeting the timetable for legislation set by Parliament during the passage of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014. Over 1,700 amendments to the Bill were tabled and debated during this time.\n\nThe Government has adopted an open and consultative approach throughout the passage of this legislation, tabling or accepting a significant number of amendments in both Houses of Parliament in order to improve transparency and strengthen privacy protections. These included enhanced protections for trade unions and journalistic and legally privileged material, and the introduction of a threshold to ensure internet connection records cannot be used to investigate minor crimes.\n\nPrivacy and Oversight\n\nThe Government has placed privacy at the heart of the Investigatory Powers Act. The Act makes clear the extent to which investigatory powers may be used and the strict safeguards that apply in order to maintain privacy.\n\nA new overarching \u2018privacy clause\u2019 was added to make absolutely clear that the protection of privacy is at the heart of this legislation. This privacy clause ensures that in each and every case a public authority must consider whether less intrusive means could be used, and must have regard to human rights and the particular sensitivity of certain information. The powers can only be exercised when it is necessary and proportionate to do so, and the Act includes tough sanctions \u2013 including the creation of new criminal offences \u2013 for those misusing the powers. \nThe safeguards in this Act reflect the UK\u2019s international reputation for protecting human rights. The unprecedented transparency and the new safeguards \u2013 including the \u2018double lock\u2019 for the most sensitive powers \u2013 set an international benchmark for how the law can protect both privacy and security. \n\nHome Office\n\nClick this link to view the response online:\n\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/173199?reveal_response=yes\n\nThis petition has over 100,000 signatures.

Most of them are incapable of surviving in the wild, as they've been bred for that purpose. Do you think a chihuahua would have a better life as a feral dog than it would in a home?\n\nA humanely kept domestic animal has an objectively better life than a wild animal in practically every respect. It is safe from predators, safe from the elements, it receives treatment for illnesses, it is warm and well fed.\n\nIt will die quickly and painlessly, as opposed to wild animals who almost always die after prolonged suffering. Being caught and mauled by a predator (often toyed with by the predator's young as a form of training), dying of an untreated injury or disease, or starving to death. The concept of a \"natural death\" as we humans see it is just about the polar opposite of what a \"natural death\" for an animal is.\n\nAnd since an animal has no knowledge of its eventual fate and therefore does not spend its captive life under psychological distress because of this foreknowledge, I simply don't see how there's anything morally suspect about this.\n\nIn fact, I would argue that by breeding and raising domestic animals and treating them well, we are reducing the proportion of suffering among animals as a whole. If biodiversity wasn't a serious concern, I would argue that we should aim to replace all higher animals with domesticated versions whose suffering is artificially minimized.\n\n> Well, the ethical arguments are fairly one sided in academia.\n\nIt's almost as if the specific type of academia you're describing [has a tendency for radicalism and dogmatism](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/03/the_prevalence_1.html).

Or was there another one?", "id": "dagzuer"}, {"comment": "> Is that what this years is about?\n\nThis year they're digging a hole.\n\n> Or was there another one?\n\nThey do different a thing every year. Couple-a years back, they bought this island: http://hawaii2.website\n\nArticle from a local news somewhere idk:\n\n(the original link is ad infested and requests desktop notification and whatever else shady shit they do, so I won't link it)\n\n> LIBERTY, Maine \u2014 There\u2019s trouble in paradise, or rather on the 6-acre Lake St. George island recently renamed Hawaii 2 by its new owners, Cards Against Humanity.\n> \n> The Chicago-based party game company purchased the former Birch Island last fall for $190,000 and promptly divvied it up in square-foot parcels to give to the 250,000 people who purchased Cards Against Humanity\u2019s holiday mystery pack.\n> \n> This move tickled some \u2014 especially participants who gleefully shared their plans for the island on social media platforms \u2014 but ticked off others. The latter include some property owners on Lake St. George who worry about the potential problems of having up to 250,000 new neighbors.\n> \n> But that kind of extreme subdividing and the installation of a platform, shed and safe within 22 feet of the lake\u2019s normal high-water line are in violation of Liberty\u2019s subdivision and shoreland zoning ordinances, according to Liberty Code Enforcement Officer Donald Harriman.\n> \n> Story continues below advertisement.\n> Late last month, Harriman wrote to three legal entities involved with Cards Against Humanity and Hawaii 2 and gave them until April 15 to cease all commercial activity on the island, revoke the 250,000 \u201clicenses\u201d that grant the exclusive use of 1 square foot of land and remove the shed and platform from its present location. If this does not happen, he wrote, the town could levy fines of no less than $100 per day per violation and up to $2,500 per day per violation.\n> \n> \u201cWhile it is unlikely that the court would order penalties of $625,000,000 per day (250,000 multiplied by $2,500), the town will seek the maximum fines, penalties and legal fees as may be awarded by the court,\u201d Harriman wrote in the letter dated March 31. \u201cA remedial plan acceptable to the town must be in place on or before April 15, 2015, to avoid the filing of a land use enforcement action in court.\u201d\n> \n> The letter was sent to Cards Against Humanity LLC, Hawaii 2 LLC and Birch Island LLC. Harriman wrote that the latter two entities are believed to be affiliated with Cards Against Humanity.\n> \n> As of Friday, Liberty had not received a response, according to Pam Chase, third selectman.\n> \n> \u201cThe purpose of a subdivision law is to limit population density,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel the subdivision ordinance would allow a parcel this small to be subdivided this many times.\u201d\n> \n> She said she has heard complaints from some residents of Liberty, a town of fewer than 1,000 people that prides itself on the pristine condition of its lakes.\n> \n> \u201cA lot of folks are concerned about just how many visitors there might be,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we only had 500 visitors that showed up in one day, that would be quite a thing for the little town of Liberty.\u201d\n> \n> Efforts Friday to contact the Cards Against Humanity agent listed in Harriman\u2019s letter were unsuccessful.\n> \n> Last December, Max Temkin, a co-creator of the company, told the Chicago Tribune that \u201cwe wanted to do something big\u201d for the annual holiday fundraising campaign.\n> \n> \u201cWe thought about trying to launch something into space or doing something visible from space,\u201d he said. \u201cEventually that led us down the path of buying a private island, which is something we\u2019ve joked about in the past.\u201d\n> \n> Cards Against Humanity sent licenses for the square foot of the island to people who purchased the $15 holiday pack and sent them a letter describing the island as wooded and uninhabited. License-holders must follow local and state laws and cannot damage or cut down any trees, the letter said.\n> \n> According to Harriman, the town of Liberty considers that the licenses for use of Hawaii 2 effectively were sold and that the island \u201ccontinues to be advertised and marketed.\u201d He wrote that a race to open the safe installed on the island and remove the prizes placed inside attracted considerable attention and that over the winter some people who purchased licenses gained access to the island by crossing private property without permission of landowners. A YouTube video about bringing the safe over to the island shows it is filled with what appear to be packs of cards.\n> \n> \u201cComplaints have been made to the town and the Waldo County sheriff\u2019s department,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am unaware if the sheriff\u2019s department or state police have issued any summonses to date.\u201d\n> \n> Efforts Friday to see what, if any, actions have been taken by the Waldo County sheriff\u2019s office regarding trespassers were not immediately successful.\n> \n> Harriman also wrote it appears Cards Against Humanity is collaborating with a business named Owlchemy Labs to promote a geocaching adventure game and will place 100 thumb drives in a tree on Hawaii 2.\n> \n> \u201cI find that an unpermitted commercial use has begun on Birch Island, in violation of the Liberty Shoreland Ordinance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe entire scheme appears to be a development and/or divisions of land for profit with the possibility of intense use at various times.\u201d\n> \n> But according to a Feb. 4 post from Cards Against Humanity on the social media website tumblr.com, that wasn\u2019t their intention. The company gave participants a license to a square foot instead of a deed to the tiny parcel of land because, \u201cif people really owned their land, they could feasibly try to get permission to build something on it, which is not what we had in mind.\u201d\n> \n> The post \u2014 which was made public nearly two months before Harriman sent his letter \u2014 quoted Temkin as saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll never develop the island. If someone else bought it, they\u2019d build a summer home or a condo or something. This way, the land will be kept as a pristine piece of wilderness.

In a previous neighborhood, the HOA was run by a few housewives who had nothing better to do than harass the shit out of neighbors.\n\nThe president had two teenage kids who were rebelling in a white, upper class way. Both kids were actually very sweet, but they clearly couldn't stand their mother. The older kid, her son, was a goth kid. The younger child, her daughter, had a smoking body and would go out of her way to flaunt it. The President would passive-aggressively harangue the kids, which just made them act out more.\n\nRather than take care of stuff that really mattered, like aggressively negotiating the property management fees, replacing broken lighting in the common areas, and fixing the neglected signage at the entrance, etc, they would drive around the neighborhood looking for bullshit violations of the covenants, like planting flowers, trees, or shrubs without getting approval, or citing someone for replacing a deck on the rear of the house with a material that wasn't a very specific type of wood with only a natural finish, which, literally, nobody else could see.\n\nWhenever they'd find a *violation*, the *violator* would find a nasty letter in their mailbox that was signed:\n\n#THE MANAGEMENT\n\nI'd been living in the neighborhood for about a year when I purchased a boat, which was a prohibited item. I brought the boat over to my house one day to clean it. Sure enough, a hateful letter was in my mailbox the following day.\n\nI immediately wrote a letter to **The Management** informing them that they'd broken Federal law by placing an article in my mailbox, which was only for USPS use, and I cited the United States Code.\n\nI also studied the covenants thoroughly, wherein I discovered that the Board members had not followed proper procedures, such as maintaining an adequate reserve fund, publishing the dates and times of ALL meetings of the board 180 days in advance, and ~~not~~ publishing meeting minutes within 5 business days after each meeting.\n\nI let the board members know that, in addition to the violations I'd found, they'd also neglected their fiduciary duties by awarding work to family members without obtaining competitive bids. Therefore, I was hiring a personal attorney to file a lawsuit against the LLC under which the HOA had been incorporated, and that under state law, the directors of the this type of company could be held personally liable for damages that occurred to others as a result of the company's actions. I pointed out that all of the residents of the community had been harmed, and they constituted a *class*, which meant that I could file a lawsuit on behalf of them, unless they choose to opt out.\n\nUpon receiving my letter, the board members all promptly resigned, and in a blustery display, said something along the lines of \"**Well, if you're going to be an asshole, we quit! If you think you can run things better, be our guest!**\"\n\nAccording the by-laws, their *note of resignation* was sufficient for myself and other volunteers to serve for the remainder of the terms that were vacated, so long as no more than 1/3 of the homeowners objected. Not a single one did.\n\nWithin three years, we'd increased the reserve fund by 5 fold without ever raising dues. We did it by renegotiating the property management contract, lawn mowing contract, getting rid of bullshit \"services\" that virtually nobody used, like the monthly picnic, flower planting days, arts & crafts supplies, etc.\n\nI learned a great deal from that experience.\n\n**EDIT 1**: I didn't really expect anyone to read a comment buried this deep. *This edit contains minor grammatical fixes, and for anyone wanting more JusticePorn, [I posted a reply below with some additional follow-up up details.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/5f2bhj/people_have_paid_a_company_more_than_80000_to_dig/dahmya7/)*", "id": "dah9xrh"}, {"comment": "The freedom to impose your will on people with slightly less power than you is the most important freedom of all.", "id": "dah4g3k"}, {"comment": "I'm so happy my neighborhood doesn't have a HOA.

Since you gotta go through them to get dollars, then they become harder to get (Nowadays government rate dollars are impossible to get). Because they are hard to get, but people still need to exchange currency (Imports, Traveling, Savings, etc), a black market emerges.\n\nFor a while, before DolarToday became popular, people would just sell or buy their foreign currency at made up rates, usually just above the official rate. Eventually, I guess this guy realized there was a way to calculate an average rate at which people are currently trading and created his website.\n\nNow to really answer your question. With time the Govt. tightened and double down their currency control, instead of realizing early it was a bad idea. With more control, the harder it was to access official rate dollars, so the exchange rate skyrocketed to where it is now. This guy can seriously affect the economy simply because people have come to trust his website so much that it essentially is the new official rate.
