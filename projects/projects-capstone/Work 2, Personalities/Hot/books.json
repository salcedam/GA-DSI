The main character in the book, Frank Burly, is pretty reminiscent of Homer Simpson -- dim-witted, but generally well-meaning, and also pretty self-aware about his dim-wittedness.

Let me just say that, even though this sub may be a strange place for me to say it, I really don't like reading. I rarely enjoy it. I'm an engineer, and I have a hard time making it through a lot of books. I read slowly, and I find myself really \"studying\" books, rereading certain passages over and over, really trying to absorb everything. It makes reading go very slowly and feels somewhat like a chore. \n\nThat being said, I fucking love Kurt Vonnegut. Love him. Breakfast of champions is the book that made me realize I could read for pleasure, and not just for school. I read BoC at the age of 20, trying to impress a girl. It didn't work out with the girl, but the book changed my whole outlook. \n\nAfter that, I read Slaughterhouse, Deadeye Dick, Monkey House, Granfaloons, Man without a country, Cats Cradle, and literally just last week finished Sirens. Throw in a couple read-throughs of JK's On the Road (only book I've ever read twice) and a failed attempt at stating the Game of Thrones novels, and that is the summed up total of my adult reading. \n\nI'm happy to wax poetic about any of those novels if there is any interes, but on to Sirens...\n\nI didn't like it. \n\nAnd I don't know how to process that. \n\nI frequently see it on lists such as these, and maybe that's why I put off reading it, or maybe its hyped-ness is to a certain degree why I didn't like it, but I don't know how to handle that. \n\nSpoilers below if you anyone who made it this far hasn't read the book yet. \n\nI kept wanting... more. I wanted a reason things worked out the way they did. A rhyme to the whole thing. I wanted Unk to remember his whole past. Every glorious excruciating detail. I wanted there to be a happy ending, even though I am exceedingly aware that such a thing doesn't truly exist in a Vonnegut universe. The whole Chron flying with the birds thing, and the Tralfamadorian message? I mean, shit. And I didn't understand how, or why, Rumfoord seemed so shocked and depressed by the ultimate fate of things at the end. Obviously, I felt sort of the same way, but I thought this guy was supposed to be, at least within the boundaries of our solar system's existance, omniscient. How was he surprised at anything? And I didn't understand his warning to unk/MC early on that he needed to protect Chron's lucky piece of metal. Why point it out? I mean, A) that mofo did absolutely nothing to protect or even mention to anyone else the importance of the piece and B) Rumfoord could see the future and knew it was going to be there, he didn't need to tell anyone anything. Certainly not anything about protecting it. Everything about that book was frustrating to me. \n\nAnd I get it, so much of his work is about the futility of existence and the flightiness of \"fate\" and free will, or lack thereof, the universe and all that. They are regularly recurring themes in his work, and I've always \"gotten\" it and almost always enjoy it. But this one just didn't sit well with me. \n\nI don't know, man, this is probably too long and too rambly to make any sense to anyone else, but tl;dr I love KV but didn't enjoy SoT and I'm not sure how to handle it.\n\nSo it goes.

The Secret Garden - Frances Hodgson Burnett\n*Read when I was about 11-12yrs old. My first long novel. A lot that a confused little girl can relate to in it. I would gift it to any young female but encourage adults to read, too.*\n\n2. Brothers Karamazov - Fyodor Dostoyevsky \n*Read and studied this book on my own, took me three months to get through it. It changed my life and was my first huge russian novel. It's a challenge to read and so deep and multi layered.*\n\n3. Notes from Underground - Fyodor Dostoyevsky \n*Read during the summer before college. My intro into existential philosophy. I did not know what existentialism was at the time, only that I could relate to every word in that book.*\n\n4. Little Women - Louisa May Alcott\n*I've read this book probably 8 times in full. Read first as a tween, about 12, 13 years old. It's a wonderful story and the women in it are strong and moral without being all religious. Alcott was a Transcendentalist and a Deist but not necessarily christian. It's a great story to show the strength of women in adversity and most of the book is based on actual events.*\n\n5. 1984 - George Orwell\n*Just read it. It's amazing.*\n\n6. Valley of the Dolls - Jaqueline Susann\n*Read when I first moved to California. It's a great story about the rise and fall of women in the mid 1900's California and NYC. It involves drug use, unwanted pregnancies, lesbianism. It was very very avant gard when written, but stands as a classic tale, IMO.*\n\n7. Sickness unto Death - Soren Kierkegaard \n*Helped me understand my own existential angst.*\n\n8. The Myth of Sisyphus - Albert Camus\n*Gave me great hope after all the angst! \"We must imagine Sisyphus Happy\"*\n\n9. Tom Sawyer - Mark Twain\n*Read as a tween, just a great classic american tale of the adventures of an american boy and his friends. Funny, and a great read. It's just an american classic.*\n\n10. Franny and Zooey - JD Salinger \n*Again an existential angst book, about a girl which was cool for me. Anything by Salinger is amazing and I would recommend reading everything he wrote.*\n\nBonus: Fight Club - Chuck Palahniuk\n*Life Altering.*"], [9, "The Prince is very short and a great thing to have read.

Will books ever make you 'manly'? Almost certainly not! It might soothe your ego and feed your addiction to proclaiming the virtues of Manliness^TM that is so popular these days. Not everyone is going to enjoy the classics if they're just reading for story, and I hate 'required' reading lists altogether. Read what you want and what you enjoy.\n\nPeople read differently. A majority of people read books entirely for narrative. Therefore, readability is the only criteria by which they're judging the book. The Bible (and, in particular, the Old Testament) is not always easy to read like a novel, cover to cover. Originality of language doesn't even come under most people's radar. I think high school curricula sort of neglect the effect of beautiful language on the impact of literature. I remember hearing a good analogy: Most people view language as a clear pane of glass through which you view a story. Instead, it is a piece of stain glass, which distorts and colors your impressions of the material.\n\nAdditionally, a lot of people have been trained by book reports in school to look for a simple 'message' in a book. I don't read in these ways and I think looking for 'messages', morals or ephihanies in books is a terrible way to read, but who am I to judge? This is less a problem with the Bible as many people do read it for moral guidance, but can explain why people elevate books with rather simple and trite messages to the status of classics (Fight Club is an odd inclusion on the list for me, but it isn't my list so again not judging!!) and 'don't get' more complex works that really have no answers. This is especially bad with poetry - People read them looking for morals. If you just want a moral or message then it can be much more clearly and succinctly expressed in prose. Indeed, I find myself skeptical whenever I find people who say their life was changed by a book, especially the lowest form of book - the self-help book. \n\nFinally, people are increasingly reading ideologically, which makes reading the Bible or Paradise Lost or whatever into a political act. I do think that cultural criticism definitely has a place (Who can read *Heart of Darkness* the same way after reading Chinua Achebe's essay?), but there is something to be said for the texts that make up the vast majority of literary allusions and have vast aesthetic merit on their own.\n\nI am not Christian or from a Christian background, but, for me, reading the (King James Version) Bible is a powerful experience. Especially the Old Testament. It is a different sort of reading, but important too, I think.", "id": "dandlfg"}, {"comment": "I agree. The Bible is the foundational text for the largest religion in the world, and it's shaped western history for the past 1700+ years. It's impact is still seen everywhere in the world today. As a literary text, it represents around 4000 years' worth of oral tradition, documented by dozens of writers over hundreds if not thousands of years. In it's translations are the work of some of the West's best scholars spanning more than a thousand years. What's more, many of the great classic writers point to the Bible as one of the more impressive literary works of history - Tennyson for example found the book of Job to be the single greatest poem of all time. \n\nI get that it's hip to know that Oceania is always at war with Eurasia, or that four legs are good but two legs are better. But in terms of a document that brushes a broad stroke across history, philosophy, ethics, morality, poetry, prose, parables, fables, and a bevy other literary devices - a document that could potentially expand your horizons by exposing you to ideas and concepts you don't already know - the Bible is one of the better choices. \n\nBut I don't believe that is the point of these must-read lists.

Let me just say that, even though this sub may be a strange place for me to say it, I really don't like reading. I rarely enjoy it. I'm an engineer, and I have a hard time making it through a lot of books. I read slowly, and I find myself really \"studying\" books, rereading certain passages over and over, really trying to absorb everything. It makes reading go very slowly and feels somewhat like a chore. \n\nThat being said, I fucking love Kurt Vonnegut. Love him.

The whole Chron flying with the birds thing, and the Tralfamadorian message? I mean, shit.

Obviously, I felt sort of the same way, but I thought this guy was supposed to be, at least within the boundaries of our solar system's existance, omniscient. How was he surprised at anything? And I didn't understand his warning to unk/MC early on that he needed to protect Chron's lucky piece of metal. Why point it out? I mean, A) that mofo did absolutely nothing to protect or even mention to anyone else the importance of the piece and B) Rumfoord could see the future and knew it was going to be there, he didn't need to tell anyone anything. Certainly not anything about protecting it. Everything about that book was frustrating to me. \n\nAnd I get it, so much of his work is about the futility of existence and the flightiness of \"fate\" and free will, or lack thereof, the universe and all that.

The Secret Garden - Frances Hodgson Burnett\n*Read when I was about 11-12yrs old. My first long novel. A lot that a confused little girl can relate to in it. I would gift it to any young female but encourage adults to read, too.*\n\n2. Brothers Karamazov - Fyodor Dostoyevsky \n*Read and studied this book on my own, took me three months to get through it. It changed my life and was my first huge russian novel. It's a challenge to read and so deep and multi layered.*\n\n3. Notes from Underground - Fyodor Dostoyevsky \n*Read during the summer before college. My intro into existential philosophy. I did not know what existentialism was at the time, only that I could relate to every word in that book.*\n\n4. Little Women - Louisa May Alcott\n*I've read this book probably 8 times in full. Read first as a tween, about 12, 13 years old. It's a wonderful story and the women in it are strong and moral without being all religious. Alcott was a Transcendentalist and a Deist but not necessarily christian. It's a great story to show the strength of women in adversity and most of the book is based on actual events.*\n\n5. 1984 - George Orwell\n*Just read it. It's amazing.*\n\n6. Valley of the Dolls - Jaqueline Susann\n*Read when I first moved to California. It's a great story about the rise and fall of women in the mid 1900's California and NYC. It involves drug use, unwanted pregnancies, lesbianism. It was very very avant gard when written, but stands as a classic tale, IMO.*\n\n7. Sickness unto Death - Soren Kierkegaard \n*Helped me understand my own existential angst.*\n\n8. The Myth of Sisyphus - Albert Camus\n*Gave me great hope after all the angst! \"We must imagine Sisyphus Happy\"*\n\n9. Tom Sawyer - Mark Twain\n*Read as a tween, just a great classic american tale of the adventures of an american boy and his friends. Funny, and a great read. It's just an american classic.*\n\n10. Franny and Zooey - JD Salinger \n*Again an existential angst book, about a girl which was cool for me. Anything by Salinger is amazing and I would recommend reading everything he wrote.*\n\nBonus: Fight Club - Chuck Palahniuk\n*Life Altering.*", "id": "danqwsw"}], [{"comment": "The Prince is very short and a great thing to have read.

If you're saying that vaccines cause autism because most people agree the data does not support that conclusion or even a correlation, then you're likely expressing a strong bias and trying to defend one of your own unpopular (and statistically likely incorrect) opinion.\n\nThere's also a broad gap between scientism and accepting scientific findings.  Most of the people I hear decrying scientism are those who are relatively scientifically literate, however find themselves needing to defend a preconceived faith based belief system from the obvious contradictions with those findings (e.g. evolution).

A \"heresy\" is a disagreement with a particular group about the interpretation or content of religious revelation. Climate change and vaccine efficacy are issues of scientific consensus derived from evidence-based scientific investigation.\n\nHeresy is dangerous to religions because religious positions are not falsifiable\u2014you cannot through observation or experimentation determine if a dissident religious belief is more or less correct than the orthodoxy.\n\nMeanwhile, science relies on *reasonable* skepticism to work properly! If you can show in a concrete, repeatable manner that a particular model is wrong, or propose a model that better fits the available observational and experimental data, scientific consensus will change. That's how it works!\n\nThe problem with climate change deniers and vaccine-resisters is that they don't really have the hard data to support their positions. Because of they did, it would become the new scientific consensus.

In the end I accept scientific knowledge because I trust the various institutions behind it. It's a similar story with religion. Only a few people are privy to coherent religious revelations, so people trust the religious experts. Just like scientists, theologians and priests claim to produce accurate findings using a sound methodology (I would claim that a truly fair evaluation between ideologies requires trusting a another set of experts, the philosophers!). Heretics are dangerous because they challenge the factual authority of the religious establishment, in the same way that anti-vaxxers and climate deniers challenge the factual authority of the scientific establishment. From the outside it looks the same.\n\nIn any case, science has the benefit of providing something tangible for society: technology. That's a good reason as any to blindly accept the teachings of the scientific elites rather than pseudoscience.

I'm not a billionaire. So the structure of American politics today is such that I thought the right ethic was to run within the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe second quote definitely points to finances being a driving factor in his choice to run as a democrat, but again he didn't abandon the party that worked against him through the primaries. He actively campaigned for them... He may have run as a democrat for reasons you disagree with, but he didn't work against them.

In almost all cases, reading a book on a topic will give the basic information about that topic *in addition to* the more nuanced or miniscule details. In fact, it will likely repeatedly present the basic information to the reader (by necessity), thereby cementing that basic information in the reader's memory. Almost any history book on World War II will continually reference at least *some of* Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, events of the late 1930s and early 1940s, the situation in Germany and France, the Manhattan Project, Einstein, Tojo, Hirohito, Mussolini, et al. and etc., as it advances the book. Along the way, all that is becoming more and more familiar to you. Cut to 12 years later at a cocktail party, and someone brings up the war. Now you're not as lost as many college students. It feels \"obvious\" to you that WWII took place in the 1940s and involved Europe, U.S., and Japan, etc. Keep in mind, many college students have no idea of any of that (sadly). \n\nThese things also don't come up in conversations if you only have really limited conversations. But that is not the only kind you can have. But you have to have them with other people who are equally \"well read\".\n\nFinally, keep in mind, intelligence is not just knowledge or being well-rounded. In fact, that's maybe the least of it. It's problem solving, pattern recognition and analysis, emotional processing, aesthetic processing, proportion detection, short and medium-term memory, creativity/generativity, verbal command, integration of complexity, etc. Good writing can accelerate all that. It's not the *only* stimuli that can do it, though. I'd argue that other people, nature, math, working with objects, and intelligent music, dance, visual arts, martial arts, film, and other media can do it, too. But reading is a particularly amenable form to nitro-boosting one's mind."], [16, "It's probably a historical throwback that still plays into modern perception.

"], [3, "I definitely think reading improves my vocabulary, especially if it's in conjunction with working on my vocabulary outside of reading (I still go OOOH! VOCAB WORD! when I read one of my middle-school vocab words). My sister was a voracious reader as a kid (and still is), and she would routinely mispronounce words that she'd read in a book and picked up enough context to know what they meant, but she wouldn't know how to say them correctly because she'd never heard anyone say them out loud.\n\nAlthough I lack evidence, I suspect that reading has helped my grammar too. I wouldn't pretend it works this way for everybody, but there are times when I can read a sentence and know that it's wrong and how to fix/improve it, but I can't explain exactly what's wrong with it. Most of that I attribute to reading; I've read \"correct\" sentences enough times that I can pick up on \"incorrect\" sentences. \n\nI also disagree that you can't become more well-rounded or learn something from a work of fiction. I read essentially zero non-fiction as a child, but a bunch of books I read were based on or mentioned actual historical events, and I was able to pick up a lot of relevant/useful information. My favorite YA series is fantasy and taught me nothing about actual events, but I could relate to, learn from, and was inspired by the main character. Books I've read have put plenty of new thoughts into my head and shaped the way I perceive current policies and how they might impact our future. As far as adult books -- right now I'm reading Cryptonomicon. Besides teaching me persistence (sorry to anyone who likes this book ... it's only been intermittently entertaining to me so far), there are bits in there about algorithms, how data is randomized, and what people can learn from both imperfectly randomized data and perfectly randomized data. No, I'm not going to become a hacker tomorrow, and yes, it's a random thing to know just a tiny/outdated bit of information about, but I definitely think my horizons are just a smidgen wider today than they were two weeks ago, thanks to reading this one book.\n\nNow, if you want to argue that you can become just as well-rounded and learn just as much from watching things as reading ... I don't disagree with that. You can learn plenty of history and fear plenty of dystopian futures and find plenty of characters to emulate and absorb plenty of random factoids from shows. I guess it's just a matter of DO people learn/fear/emulate/absorb when they watch shows, or are most people like me, and they just want to zone out and watch someone else's drama unfold for a while so they can forget their own? Not that you can't read books for their zone-out value too, though."], [3, "To me it is a very active hobby. And I know that seems weird. While on the surface, playing video games or watching TV seems to have the same effect of story telling as reading, there is a huge difference. When you sit down and watch a movie or show it happens to you. You passively experience it. I know it seems that playing video games is not passive but I'll touch on that later.\n\nBut with reading nothing is happening to you. All the stimulation comes from yourself. We have to actively choose to engage our brains in a way that we don't see with other media, like video games. Yes we get to make choices with video games, but the experience is powered by external stimulation. We have to power our own experience when we read, and I think that itself attracts certain types of brains. \n\nOn top of that, these days we need to choose lack of external stimulation over stimulation in order to be drawn to reading. In the same way that most people know that a few minutes if meditation is good for the brain, but avoid doing it in favour of being stimulated, stimulation is addictive and most people give in to that. It is easy to sit back and watch TV, but you have to want to read in order to read. \n\nEven for me, I struggle to fight the urge to put on a movie regardless of the fact that I know I will enjoy reading more. I think the ability to make the choice to engage our brain comes along with the desire for mental exploration that comes with intelligence. Learning something can be driven by classes or tutorials, but actual learning takes place inside our own brains. Intelligent people seem to consistently choose learning, and I would say in a broad sense, that drive for learning and internal stimulation is intelligence.\n\nThat being said I know lots of people who are smart and have PhDs and who don't read (they seem oddly proud of it too) but I don't know many people I percieve as dumb who read. I do know lots of less intelligent people who listen to audio books, and I think that is a similar argument but I don't need to get into that.\n\n\n\n"], [3, "Literacy changes the way you think. Writing things down forces a clarity and organization of thought that the ephemeral spoken word does not. When you read a lot, you're exposing yourself to this way of thinking on a regular basis, and it changes the way you organize and format your own thoughts.\n\nThe human brain can hold about 7 items in its short term memory at once. For some people it's a few more, for others it's a few less. When you use written symbolic representations of thought, that number explodes. And you can later use those symbolic representations to aid your short term memory. For example, without the ability to count, the difference between 20 and 30 of something is hard to reason about. But once you understand numbers and have concepts of those symbolic representations memorized, you can reason about that with no difficulty. Now extrapolate that to more deep concepts. At high reading levels, a single word can convey as much meaning and nuance as several paragraphs of less good writing. If you're reading classic novels, you're getting insight into the human condition that your mom is absolutely not getting from her soap operas."], [1, "In terms of entertainment books are no different than movies, tv series, games or podcasts. Hell, I would argue that other medium prove to be more entertaining for most people. \n\nBut when it comes to gaining new information nothing comes close to  the bandwidth of information that you can get via reading. Lectures, talking to people, listening are far slower at transferring new info to your head. \n\nReading doesn't inherently makes you smarter, it's the ease with which new info can be gained that makes you smater.\n\n\n"], [2, "This is precisely the stereotype that intimidates new readers, in my experience anyway.

Maybe my vocabulary is broader and I might be able to put my thoughts on paper more easily, but other than that there is not much difference. However, reading goes far beyond mere intelligence. When you read, you are putting yourself into different situations, ones you may never experience otherwise. When you read, you find yourself thinking of the world and the people in it in ways you've never thought of before. TV can give you some of the same outcomes but you are not able to connect as emotionally as you would a book; a book takes longer to read, has more detail and insight into a character, etc. All in all, nearly all forms of entertainment have their benefits and we should never assume that someone who doesn't read is dumb, or someone who constantly reads is a genius.

VOCAB WORD! when I read one of my middle-school vocab words). My sister was a voracious reader as a kid (and still is), and she would routinely mispronounce words that she'd read in a book and picked up enough context to know what they meant, but she wouldn't know how to say them correctly because she'd never heard anyone say them out loud.\n\nAlthough I lack evidence, I suspect that reading has helped my grammar too. I wouldn't pretend it works this way for everybody, but there are times when I can read a sentence and know that it's wrong and how to fix/improve it, but I can't explain exactly what's wrong with it. Most of that I attribute to reading; I've read \"correct\" sentences enough times that I can pick up on \"incorrect\" sentences. \n\nI also disagree that you can't become more well-rounded or learn something from a work of fiction. I read essentially zero non-fiction as a child, but a bunch of books I read were based on or mentioned actual historical events, and I was able to pick up a lot of relevant/useful information. My favorite YA series is fantasy and taught me nothing about actual events, but I could relate to, learn from, and was inspired by the main character. Books I've read have put plenty of new thoughts into my head and shaped the way I perceive current policies and how they might impact our future. As far as adult books -- right now I'm reading Cryptonomicon. Besides teaching me persistence (sorry to anyone who likes this book ... it's only been intermittently entertaining to me so far), there are bits in there about algorithms, how data is randomized, and what people can learn from both imperfectly randomized data and perfectly randomized data. No, I'm not going to become a hacker tomorrow, and yes, it's a random thing to know just a tiny/outdated bit of information about, but I definitely think my horizons are just a smidgen wider today than they were two weeks ago, thanks to reading this one book.\n\nNow, if you want to argue that you can become just as well-rounded and learn just as much from watching things as reading ... I don't disagree with that. You can learn plenty of history and fear plenty of dystopian futures and find plenty of characters to emulate and absorb plenty of random factoids from shows. I guess it's just a matter of DO people learn/fear/emulate/absorb when they watch shows, or are most people like me, and they just want to zone out and watch someone else's drama unfold for a while so they can forget their own? Not that you can't read books for their zone-out value too, though.", "id": "dahab1q"}], [{"comment": "To me it is a very active hobby. And I know that seems weird. While on the surface, playing video games or watching TV seems to have the same effect of story telling as reading, there is a huge difference. When you sit down and watch a movie or show it happens to you. You passively experience it. I know it seems that playing video games is not passive but I'll touch on that later.\n\nBut with reading nothing is happening to you. All the stimulation comes from yourself. We have to actively choose to engage our brains in a way that we don't see with other media, like video games. Yes we get to make choices with video games, but the experience is powered by external stimulation. We have to power our own experience when we read, and I think that itself attracts certain types of brains. \n\nOn top of that, these days we need to choose lack of external stimulation over stimulation in order to be drawn to reading. In the same way that most people know that a few minutes if meditation is good for the brain, but avoid doing it in favour of being stimulated, stimulation is addictive and most people give in to that. It is easy to sit back and watch TV, but you have to want to read in order to read. \n\nEven for me, I struggle to fight the urge to put on a movie regardless of the fact that I know I will enjoy reading more. I think the ability to make the choice to engage our brain comes along with the desire for mental exploration that comes with intelligence. Learning something can be driven by classes or tutorials, but actual learning takes place inside our own brains. Intelligent people seem to consistently choose learning, and I would say in a broad sense, that drive for learning and internal stimulation is intelligence.\n\nThat being said I know lots of people who are smart and have PhDs and who don't read (they seem oddly proud of it too) but I don't know many people I percieve as dumb who read. I do know lots of less intelligent people who listen to audio books, and I think that is a similar argument but I don't need to get into that.\n\n\n\n", "id": "daiy4qw"}, {"comment": "Oh yea and the cultural perception probably also stems from the fact that only scholars could read for a long time.

For some people it's a few more, for others it's a few less. When you use written symbolic representations of thought, that number explodes. And you can later use those symbolic representations to aid your short term memory. For example, without the ability to count, the difference between 20 and 30 of something is hard to reason about. But once you understand numbers and have concepts of those symbolic representations memorized, you can reason about that with no difficulty. Now extrapolate that to more deep concepts.

He had a good handle on why some people do the things they do and how they feel when they do them and was able to articulate that in a funny and often moving way. I also think he was probably a better essayist than he was a writer of fiction as his knack for observation was really able to take centre stage when he was given a real world subject to tackle and didn't have the same license for self-indulgence that he had with his fiction; [his essay on Federer in particular is superb.](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?pagewanted=all)\n\nA lot of the authors he's associated with (Pynchon, DeLillo etc) can come across as incredibly cynical and distant, by contrast Wallace feels almost uncomfortably personal and intimate at times. I'm a big fan of Pynchon and enjoy DeLillo's work, but I've never felt the same emotional connection and response to their work as I have to sections of Wallace's. I think it's down to a lot of what Pynchon and Delillo write having no immediate relevance outside of its central themes, I can't really relate on a gut level to the sprawling history of a world full of caricatures or, in DeLillo's case, characters who all sound the same and feel like mouthpieces, in the same way I can the characters in Infinite Jest.\n\nHaving said all that, I do think the weird, self-help guru status he's attained since his death is a negative thing. It's detrimental to his work, glosses over his flaws and is probably something even he wouldn't have wanted - people have latched onto him in the same way they latched onto Bill Hicks and have elevated him to something he's not. The 'This Is Water' speech in particular has done a lot to distort his public image; I mean this is a guy who, despite extolling the virtues of empathy and respect for others, [threw a coffee table at and tried to push out of a car a woman he was obsessed with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace#Personal_life) and was rumoured to have slept with his students. He may have been a great writer, but he was a deeply flawed human being and the cloying fan worship people have for him does everyone a disservice and can be off-putting to people who might otherwise enjoy his work.\n\nI do think when he was on his game he was brilliant, but he could also be a bit like that person you sometimes meet at a party who reveals far too much about themselves far too quickly and keeps making self-deprecating comments whilst laughing nervously. \n\nre: IJ - You should finish it, it doesn't really come together until you've read it all and revisited the opening chapter as it's designed as a loop, much like the tape itself, and the beginning is chronologically the end of the timeline. It was once I re-read the first chapter that I realised how brilliant it was, stuff that had initially seemed trivial started to leap off the page and all the threads started to pull together in a way that felt incredibly rewarding.\n\n\n"], [10, "If you're not feeling Infinite Jest but want to try some Wallace, I'd go for \"Consider the Lobster.\" Funny and interesting short stories without the dozens of pages of math-related footnotes that I don't quite care about."], [5, "I hear you.\n\nOnce in a while I come across an excerpt and always think \"absolutely not\".\n\nHis fans are not a recommendation either."], [5, "I just finished Infinite Jest and I have a lot of mixed feeling about it. The one plot line that I loved consistently throughout the book was the main story of the Incandenza family. It almost felt like it was the inspiration for The Royal Tenenbaums. There are numerous similarities! I would put money that Wes Anderson dared Infinite jest in the 90's. If you feel you are strong reader and can endure his style, Infinite Jest is actually a hilarious book. I can't remember the last time literature gave me a gut buster. This book did it several times. Personally, as a reefer-addict myself, reading DFW write pages and pages and pages of someone waiting to buy weed or their love for smoking weed in secrecy is... is... Felt like he was taking my own thoughts out of my head sometimes. I often wondered if people who don't smoke weed and would get his nuances would be completely bored by it. But I guess the same could go with the Enfield Tennis Academy too. I mean, unrelated, he humorously (one of those gut busters) predicts Facebook, Instagram, and all of social media in '96.\n\nHere's the main takeaway that I think (maybe?) was the big purpose of Infinite Jest. It read, not just like Pynchon, but like Proust. DFW can stay on one scene, one room, one moment, and write countless pages about anything and everything relative and pertaining to THAT moment. Although his prose is long and difficult, never is it irrelevant. Ever. Like Proust's, In Search of Lost Time, DFW finds all the depths of a moment before moving onto the next. Basically, it made think of how much \"regular\" literature can gloss over everything. Although I would never want my books to be as detailed as Infinite Jest, it was nice to read a book that dared into every possible nuance.

His non-fiction, little there is, was the best of him, IMHO. My suggestion is try reading the guy Wallace absolutely hated, John Updike."], [3, "And...

Most people don't want to do work to read books (see ftn. 1), but this is one of the few cases where you're rewarded with hilarious literature and an interesting perspective for doing it.

He had a good handle on why some people do the things they do and how they feel when they do them and was able to articulate that in a funny and often moving way. I also think he was probably a better essayist than he was a writer of fiction as his knack for observation was really able to take centre stage when he was given a real world subject to tackle and didn't have the same license for self-indulgence that he had with his fiction; [his essay on Federer in particular is superb.](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?pagewanted=all)\n\nA lot of the authors he's associated with (Pynchon, DeLillo etc) can come across as incredibly cynical and distant, by contrast Wallace feels almost uncomfortably personal and intimate at times. I'm a big fan of Pynchon and enjoy DeLillo's work, but I've never felt the same emotional connection and response to their work as I have to sections of Wallace's. I think it's down to a lot of what Pynchon and Delillo write having no immediate relevance outside of its central themes, I can't really relate on a gut level to the sprawling history of a world full of caricatures or, in DeLillo's case, characters who all sound the same and feel like mouthpieces, in the same way I can the characters in Infinite Jest.\n\nHaving said all that, I do think the weird, self-help guru status he's attained since his death is a negative thing. It's detrimental to his work, glosses over his flaws and is probably something even he wouldn't have wanted - people have latched onto him in the same way they latched onto Bill Hicks and have elevated him to something he's not. The 'This Is Water' speech in particular has done a lot to distort his public image; I mean this is a guy who, despite extolling the virtues of empathy and respect for others, [threw a coffee table at and tried to push out of a car a woman he was obsessed with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace#Personal_life) and was rumoured to have slept with his students. He may have been a great writer, but he was a deeply flawed human being and the cloying fan worship people have for him does everyone a disservice and can be off-putting to people who might otherwise enjoy his work.\n\nI do think when he was on his game he was brilliant, but he could also be a bit like that person you sometimes meet at a party who reveals far too much about themselves far too quickly and keeps making self-deprecating comments whilst laughing nervously. \n\nre: IJ - You should finish it, it doesn't really come together until you've read it all and revisited the opening chapter as it's designed as a loop, much like the tape itself, and the beginning is chronologically the end of the timeline. It was once I re-read the first chapter that I realised how brilliant it was, stuff that had initially seemed trivial started to leap off the page and all the threads started to pull together in a way that felt incredibly rewarding.\n\n\n", "id": "dann3xd"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the detailed feedback!", "id": "danoek2"}], [{"comment": "If you're not feeling Infinite Jest but want to try some Wallace, I'd go for \"Consider the Lobster.\" Funny and interesting short stories without the dozens of pages of math-related footnotes that I don't quite care about.", "id": "dancvwd"}, {"comment": "Consider the Lobster is a collection of essays, not short stories.", "id": "dani8ku"}, {"comment": "on that note \"Anthemn\" is a great first step into ayn rand", "id": "danemxk"}, {"comment": "I dove head first into the Ayn Rand books.

There are numerous similarities! I would put money that Wes Anderson dared Infinite jest in the 90's. If you feel you are strong reader and can endure his style, Infinite Jest is actually a hilarious book. I can't remember the last time literature gave me a gut buster. This book did it several times. Personally, as a reefer-addict myself, reading DFW write pages and pages and pages of someone waiting to buy weed or their love for smoking weed in secrecy is... is... Felt like he was taking my own thoughts out of my head sometimes. I often wondered if people who don't smoke weed and would get his nuances would be completely bored by it. But I guess the same could go with the Enfield Tennis Academy too. I mean, unrelated, he humorously (one of those gut busters) predicts Facebook, Instagram, and all of social media in '96.\n\nHere's the main takeaway that I think (maybe?) was the big purpose of Infinite Jest. It read, not just like Pynchon, but like Proust. DFW can stay on one scene, one room, one moment, and write countless pages about anything and everything relative and pertaining to THAT moment. Although his prose is long and difficult, never is it irrelevant. Ever. Like Proust's, In Search of Lost Time, DFW finds all the depths of a moment before moving onto the next. Basically, it made think of how much \"regular\" literature can gloss over everything. Although I would never want my books to be as detailed as Infinite Jest, it was nice to read a book that dared into every possible nuance.

I'm like the least manly guy I know, and I've probably read over half of these. There is a lot of good stuff here, though, so some of it is definitely worth looking at.\n\nOne final thought: maybe they should have put a couple sentences on each book about WHY it's on the list, rather than just a quick summary of the book. We can all read the Amazon description or the book jacket."], [94, "Well, zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance was on the list, so ok.\n\nmanly lesson from that one was the beer can shim."], [93, "Lot of good books males should read, but the fact they made it ONE HUNDRED long and just added generic \u201cwell known good books\u201d to fill out the list really took away from it."], [67, "I see a lot of folk dismissing the AoM as some insecure shill of a blog, but I've read a lot of quality articles on that site that have improved my relationships and have made me a more thoughtful, courageous person.

"], [47, "It's disheartening that most people on this thread are discrediting the value of reading these books because of the website that facilitated the list. The breadth of the subject matter covered by the list has the potential to spark a person's interest into delving deeper into many different subjects - history, philosophy, economics, English literature, and so on. Surely this is a valuable pursuit. Additionally, many of the moral, ideological, and political doctrines in the books are diverse and often in conflict with one another. Ayn Rand and Alasdair MacIntyre are on the same list, for goodness sake.\n\nThis is a subreddit devoted to reading in case anybody has forgotten that.

There are definitely some good books on there, but I just don't understand how you come up with a list of this size. What qualifies a book apart from it being a decent read? I understand the website is aimed at men, so really it had to be a list of books men should read in some way. But how and why were those books chosen?\n\nAnyway, I agree with some of the selections. I do think for example that every man should read some Ernest Hemingway, as a lot of his books are about masculinity. But really, a lot of books mentioned should be read by everybody - not just men. \n\nAs somebody else pointed out though, most of these books were written by men. While they give a man's point of view, surely to be a rounded person you need to also read books by the opposite sex as well? (But it'd be hard for the list writer to do so if they haven't read many books by women...)\n\nI'd be interested to see a similar list aimed at women as it might interest me more?"], [17, "I used to follow AoM quite a bit about 5-6 years ago when they were smaller.

"], [15, "One thing I'm noticing is a serious lack of literature by female authors. \n\nYes, there are a few up there (Ayn Rand, Jane Austen, etc). I also understand that many of the \"classics\" are written by men, and that this is a list is for men, but still. There are plenty of award winning books that touch of the subject of masculinity in some form that are written by women. "], [15, "I hate stuff like this. There's no barrier to entry to be a 'real man/woman' (bracing myself for some edgy responses). All the prerequisites for 'manliness' seem to boil down to embarrassing gentleman stereotypes."], [14, "really? this should be called \"the books you read in highschool\". as a vehement fan of brave new world, the blurb included in this list isn't even accurate. to think that bernard marx is the main focus of the novel is foolish. the power of the novel comes from the introduction, and narrative, of John the Savage. a small nitpick i know, but to me it indicates that this list is just somebody trying to make themselves seem more intelligent by listing books they think that smart people read.

Here's a direct link for anyone who finds this post later. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/KRJAk \n\nSo, here is how it works. \n\nThere are three sections in which you read a chapter or two everyday. This can be up to 6+ chapters a day. Especially in psalms but those are generally short. Each section covers a specific slant under history, prophets, or new testament to provide a framework for the reader. \n\nKnow that this reading plan doesn't come with analysis or anything of that sort. It is merely to break the Bible into three concise parts to make it easier to get through over the year. \n\nLastly, You do not have to start it on January 1st. Just print it out or keep track of what you've read. It's a full 365 days of reading and will keep you busy. If you fall behind or miss a day, don't fret. Just pick up where you left off.

For instance, here's Smith endorsing progressive tax rates:\n\n>The proportion of the expence of house-rent to the whole expence of living is different in the different degrees of fortune. It is perhaps highest in the highest degree, and it diminishes gradually through the inferior degrees, so as in general to be lowest in the lowest degree. The necessaries of life occasion the great expence of the poor. They find it difficult to get food, and the greater part of their little revenue is spent in getting it. The luxuries and vanities of life occasion the principal expence of the rich, and a magnificent house embellishes and sets off to the best advantage all the other luxuries and vanities which they possess. A tax upon house-rents, therefore, would in general fall heaviest upon the rich; and in this sort of inequality there would not, perhaps, be any thing very unreasonable. It is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expence, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion.\n\nAnd here's Smith demonstrating he understands the importance relative poverty (how poor one is within one's society), not just absolute material poverty:\n\n>By necessaries I understand not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to be without. A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly speaking, not a necessary of life. The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very comfortably though they had no linen. But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day-labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty which, it is presumed, nobody can well fall into without extreme bad conduct. Custom, in the same manner, has rendered leather shoes a necessary of life in England. The poorest creditable person of either sex would be ashamed to appear in public without them. In Scotland, custom has rendered them a necessary of life to the lowest order of men; but not to the same order of women, who may, without any discredit, walk about barefooted. In France they are necessaries neither to men nor to women, the lowest rank of both sexes appearing there publicly, without any discredit, sometimes in wooden shoes, and sometimes barefooted.

I wasn't really sure, but who was I, as a new author, to argue? My protagonists were women, true, but they were divorced and had kids and although they were sort of looking for love, they were mostly concerned with other things too: like how to keep their children from writing on the walls and maybe how to settle issues they had with their moms. You know, real life. So! When I wrote my fourth novel (The Stuff That Never Happened), and the protagonist was NOT a young woman but was about to turn 50 and who was debating whether to keep her marriage together or to reinvent herself with the \"one who got away,\" it was clear that I was no longer in the \"chick lit\" category.

I am among those American writers whose books have been destroyed in the now famous furnace of your school.\nCertain members of your community have suggested that my work is evil. This is extraordinarily insulting to me. The news from Drake indicates to me that books and writers are very unreal to you people. I am writing this letter to let you know how real I am.\nI want you to know, too, that my publisher and I have done absolutely nothing to exploit the disgusting news from Drake. We are not clapping each other on the back, crowing about all the books we will sell because of the news. We have declined to go on television, have written no fiery letters to editorial pages, have granted no lengthy interviews. We are angered and sickened and saddened. And no copies of this letter have been sent to anybody else. You now hold the only copy in your hands. It is a strictly private letter from me to the people of Drake, who have done so much to damage my reputation in the eyes of their children and then in the eyes of the world. Do you have the courage and ordinary decency to show this letter to the people, or will it, too, be consigned to the fires of your furnace?\nI gather from what I read in the papers and hear on television that you imagine me, and some other writers, too, as being sort of ratlike people who enjoy making money from poisoning the minds of young people. I am in fact a large, strong person, fifty-one years old, who did a lot of farm work as a boy, who is good with tools. I have raised six children, three my own and three adopted. They have all turned out well. Two of them are farmers. I am a combat infantry veteran from World War II, and hold a Purple Heart. I have earned whatever I own by hard work. I have never been arrested or sued for anything. I am so much trusted with young people and by young people that I have served on the faculties of the University of Iowa, Harvard, and the City College of New York. Every year I receive at least a dozen invitations to be commencement speaker at colleges and high schools. My books are probably more widely used in schools than those of any other living American fiction writer.\nIf you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don\u2019t damage children much. They didn\u2019t damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.\nAfter I have said all this, I am sure you are still ready to respond, in effect, \u201cYes, yes\u2013but it still remains our right and our responsibility to decide what books our children are going to be made to read in our community.\u201d This is surely so. But it is also true that if you exercise that right and fulfill that responsibility in an ignorant, harsh, un-American manner, then people are entitled to call you bad citizens and fools. Even your own children are entitled to call you that.\nI read in the newspaper that your community is mystified by the outcry from all over the country about what you have done. Well, you have discovered that Drake is a part of American civilization, and your fellow Americans can\u2019t stand it that you have behaved in such an uncivilized way. Perhaps you will learn from this that books are sacred to free men for very good reasons, and that wars have been fought against nations which hate books and burn them. If you are an American, you must allow all ideas to circulate freely in your community, not merely your own.\nIf you and your board are now determined to show that you in fact have wisdom and maturity when you exercise your powers over the eduction of your young, then you should acknowledge that it was a rotten lesson you taught young people in a free society when you denounced and then burned books\u2013books you hadn\u2019t even read. You should also resolve to expose your children to all sorts of opinions and information, in order that they will be better equipped to make decisions and to survive.\nAgain: you have insulted me, and I am a good citizen, and I am very real.\n\nKurt Vonnegut\n"], [58, "It's just sad that the ones opposing the books have no reading comprehension.

Do you have the courage and ordinary decency to show this letter to the people, or will it, too, be consigned to the fires of your furnace?\nI gather from what I read in the papers and hear on television that you imagine me, and some other writers, too, as being sort of ratlike people who enjoy making money from poisoning the minds of young people. I am in fact a large, strong person, fifty-one years old, who did a lot of farm work as a boy, who is good with tools. I have raised six children, three my own and three adopted. They have all turned out well. Two of them are farmers. I am a combat infantry veteran from World War II, and hold a Purple Heart. I have earned whatever I own by hard work. I have never been arrested or sued for anything. I am so much trusted with young people and by young people that I have served on the faculties of the University of Iowa, Harvard, and the City College of New York. Every year I receive at least a dozen invitations to be commencement speaker at colleges and high schools. My books are probably more widely used in schools than those of any other living American fiction writer.\nIf you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don\u2019t damage children much. They didn\u2019t damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.\nAfter I have said all this, I am sure you are still ready to respond, in effect, \u201cYes, yes\u2013but it still remains our right and our responsibility to decide what books our children are going to be made to read in our community.\u201d This is surely so. But it is also true that if you exercise that right and fulfill that responsibility in an ignorant, harsh, un-American manner, then people are entitled to call you bad citizens and fools. Even your own children are entitled to call you that.\nI read in the newspaper that your community is mystified by the outcry from all over the country about what you have done. Well, you have discovered that Drake is a part of American civilization, and your fellow Americans can\u2019t stand it that you have behaved in such an uncivilized way. Perhaps you will learn from this that books are sacred to free men for very good reasons, and that wars have been fought against nations which hate books and burn them. If you are an American, you must allow all ideas to circulate freely in your community, not merely your own.\nIf you and your board are now determined to show that you in fact have wisdom and maturity when you exercise your powers over the eduction of your young, then you should acknowledge that it was a rotten lesson you taught young people in a free society when you denounced and then burned books\u2013books you hadn\u2019t even read. You should also resolve to expose your children to all sorts of opinions and information, in order that they will be better equipped to make decisions and to survive.\nAgain: you have insulted me, and I am a good citizen, and I am very real.\n\nKurt Vonnegut\n", "id": "dao687s"}], [{"comment": "It's just sad that the ones opposing the books have no reading comprehension.

Reading is not just about the love of doing it. Let's be real, we all enjoy reading here but that's an overly romantic view. No matter how much you love reading, you're not going to love every moment of every book. In fact, you're probably going to love only a small minority of the books you read, and even then perhaps not every chapter. Reading requires discipline when the love isn't there and that takes practice, time, and patience. Just because you don't love a book right at the very moment and want to put it down doesn't mean that it won't be a rewarding experience, or ultimately worth it, to slog it out to get to the end. Not only that, you'll be hamstrung if you ever need to read a book and you find you lack the willpower or attention span to get through it.", "id": "danoy0u"}, {"comment": "I'm a little confused by what you wrote, in particular what you are objecting to...\n\nLet's start with:\n\n> Reading is not just about the love of doing it. \n\nI'd argue in my case it is all about \"the love of doing it\".  I read, and have since a very young age, because I love to read.  I spend hours reading most days, go to the library, go to the bookstore, etc all because of my love of reading and this isn't some warped self image, anyone who knows me would say \"that Linus, he sure loves to read\".   I'd also hasten to point out that in the same way I say \"I love reading\" I could say \"I love playing cello\", how is playing the cello \"not about the love of doing it\"?\n\n>Let's be real, we all enjoy reading here but that's an overly romantic view. Let's be real, we all enjoy reading here but that's an overly romantic view. No matter how much you love reading, you're not going to love every moment of every book. In fact, you're probably going to love only a small minority of the books you read, and even then perhaps not every chapter.\n\nIf I follow here, you're saying that because I might not like every book I read, that somehow invalidates the statement \"I love to read\".  This is where I get confused because \"I love to read\" and \"I love every book I read\" are two non-equivalent statements, in fact neither implies the other.\n\n>Reading requires discipline when the love isn't there and that takes practice, time, and patience.\n\nThe only scenario \"when the love isn't there\" is when you have to read something you don't understand/like which is the result of some imperative (external or internal), otherwise there is no need for \"discipline\" or \"patience\".   If you're somehow \"required\", then by all means you'll have to suck it up and plow on, but If not, and you don't like what you're reading, stop and read something else. \n\n> Just because you don't love a book right at the very moment and want to put it down doesn't mean that it won't be a rewarding experience, or ultimately worth it, to slog it out to get to the end. \n\nTrue.  But neither is the converse true.  It is not the case that slogging through a book you didn't like to the end is in automatically rewarding.  So the only thing you can hope to say here is \"maybe it's worth it\".  (If you want to say \"because I did it\" you're talking about an internal imperative and you're back in the case above).  Here's an example, I once started a Janet Evanovich book, I read along until I came upon a character called \"Lula\".  This character struck me as borderline racist at worst and a lazily drawn stereotype at best.  I stopped reading the book and haven't read another one since, I went on to  read other books I found more enjoyable.  How would finishing this book would have benefited me?\n\n>Not only that, you'll be hamstrung if you ever need to read a book and you find you lack the willpower or attention span to get through it.\n\nI agree that lacking willpower or attention span will make it difficult to finish a book, but only in so far as lacking will power or attention span will make it difficult to do *anything* unless the \"anything\" is \"acting like someone with a lack of will power and a short attention span\". \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "danut0v"}]]], "5fehhg": ["Finnished Ann Leckie' Ancilliary trilogy today", "2016-11-29 00:43:50", 6, "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5fehhg/finnished_ann_leckie_ancilliary_trilogy_today/", [[1, "I got through the first one alright.

None of them made me become sexually active (I actually waited until I was 20) and none of them made me twisted or neurotic or afraid of sex. I think I have a pretty open and healthy attitude towards sex in all it's varieties - probably because reading about it helps you understand other people's views and experiences and desires, while allowing them to still be sympathetic characters you can relate to in other ways.\n\nI wish Americans could get over it already. Any type of sex between willing adult participants that causes no one harm needs to be a fine and private thing that's honestly no one else's business, but also nothing to ever be ashamed of.

Daniel chose the poem himself, as it was a piece that he has returned to many times over the years in his reading. The editing of the poem was a very considered process, which was exciting but also pretty terrifying, knowing the importance of the poem, and how much it's loved. We are not saying this is the definitive version of Prufrock - but how Daniel and Laura came to see it.

It did a great job of being in communication with the original text but also adding something new and modern to the conversation. \n\nOnly little nit pick is how the first couple of lines are read. Let us go then you and I is such overt romantic rhyming and then it crashes down to earth with the broken rhythm stark image of \"like a patient.\" The break in rhythm is one of the most dramatic intros, but the way it's read in the film you don't get that", "id": "dan3tma"}, {"comment": "Thanks. It's really interesting to hear that. Daniel recorded a voiceover way back before we shot the film to help with the production and editing process. But after shooting the film, which we shot over one long day and night in New York, we went back and recorded it again, as Daniel's understanding of the text and feeling for the words had changed considerably as a result of walking through certain half-deserted streets, watching the smoke that rises from the pipes, and a restless night spent in a one-night cheap hotel (apologies to our production assistant, whose apartment it actually is). The original VO felt very 'actorly' to him as a result. Its interesting to compare his reading with it with the readings that are available online by, amongst others, Jeremy Irons, Anthony Hopkins, Tom Hiddleston and, of course, by Eliot himself.

How do you remain a self if all you have are your thoughts? And does the work/school/social/cultural/spiritual repression inhibit your thinking? What effect on your creativity when all that's left is the State?  \n  \nGreat writing throughout, captivating generational story, a mystery, a book within a book, a little magic, a lot of music, a decent chunk of Tienanmen Square protest and its roots, and characters you grow to love. I was pleasantly surprised the author didn't bring up the Tank Man at all (I missed it if she did) because I think it would've reeked of intellectual dishonesty. Writing about a hallmark like that automatically imbues the story with what the author supposes the reader knows about it, sort of like a shortcut to depth. The author created characters vivid enough with enough complexity that she didn't need that marker as a path to our caring. The government here, the soldiers, the students with red arm bands, made the antagonists to our main characters nebulous and mysterious and enhanced the paranoia and fear--really captured what it must've been like for someone to live through this: the fear at every turn, friends turned activists turned traitors turned soldiers, neighbors and family disappearing, questions never answered.", "id": "damxaov"}]]], "5fitr5": ["Reading religious texts as literature", "2016-11-29 17:11:19", 4, "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/5fitr5/reading_religious_texts_as_literature/", [[7, "\"God: A Biography\" by Jack Miles is a classic (Pulitzer winner) that goes through each book of the Bible breaking it down as literature with the character of God analysed as the protagonist in many cases. \n\nhttp://www.jackmiles.com/Home/books/god-a-biography"], [5, "Check out an old book called Hamlet's Mill"], [3, "I had to read a few sections of the bible for a sort of joint history/literature class in college.

Honestly, when somebody says something like \"I overcame [life disaster] by the grace of this self-help book I found/was given\", I don't cheer against their victory or anything, but I always imagine that, when you're at a super low point, pretty much any alternative is welcome. So like, while the advice itself may not be especially good or philosophically complete, it might, for one reason or another, help you to, say, stay off heroin. The result speaks for itself, so you aren't too picky in hindsight about how you got there, because *sloppy philosophy that helps you stay clean is better than relapsing*. It's a lesson in not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\nBut then to the second, I don't want to attribute any more profundity to the advice than is necessary. I've been acquainted with some New Age types, and I've ended up reading a lot of that stuff just to try and get inside the heads of people who are trying to sell me on it (I did not finish this book, I grant that), and part of me gets the impression these lessons are typically both signposted and explained in such vague language that, with enough willpower and charitable interpretation, the bare phrasing can be retrofitted to your existing beliefs in a way that seems like something is \"clicking\", or like you're having an \"Aha!\" moment.\n\nIt's sort of like what happens with cold reading/horoscopes--your intuitions are primed by deliberately ambiguous language so you latch on and start pumping in your own information, and you feel like there's some kind of connection there when it's really just your own thoughts being repackaged and delivered to you. I don't deny the potential *efficacy* of self-help, but I deny the source of the advice: the benign things these Agreements are being interpreted as invoking are things I imagine already occur to pretty much everyone on some level, even if they get caught up in trying to justify doing the opposite--the fundamental takeaway just seems to be a special case of \"don't be an asshole\". If you're known as a serial liar, if you're super distrustful and hostile all the time, and if you half-ass everything you do, you're probably going to have a bad time. The reason you see virtues like these bubble up cross-culturally is because they're probably psychologically latent. If there's a more eloquent and spiritual-sounding packaging you can wrap them up in to remind people of something they probably already understand deep down, more power to them if it helps them get out of a dark place. But we don't have to pretend it's cutting-edge moral philosophy or a great wisdom.\n\nI guess I'm trying to look forward--like, it would be great if everyone cooperated and was really compassionate and stoic all the time, but the thing about most of the dispassionate sages is they weren't especially interested in worldly affairs, so thorough practice of their exalted virtues was a great strategy because they didn't have any real skin in the fight--they just accepted whatever the outcome was, self-satisfied their destiny was in the hands of Nature, or Fate, or one or more Gods, so whatever way things turned out was the way things either must be or ought to be. But for people who are immersed in the world, basic virtue templates probably aren't enough because you have to respond adequately to your environment to make it, so your strategy has to involve shrewdness and *some* amount of ruthless calculation, neither of which this advice prepares you for."], [1, "Thank you so much for this.

But I'm under no obligation to regard the criticisms of some random person as something I \"should\" take personally. It's not \"ignoring reality\", it's a conscious decision not to concern oneself with the judgments of others, because most of the time they're completely unimportant. And whenever they are important, then you address them - but even then, the idea of taking the word of others *personally* seems, in the colloquial sense, to be counter-productive to the goal: of meaningfully responding to someone trying to communicate with you.\n\nAnd it is false to claim that a person isn't an individual among individuals. Now, you might argue that there is a bigger picture than that, or that it's an incomplete perspective, and that's true. But *it is a true statement* that we are each individuals among individuals, however many qualifiers you might have to add to that in order to form a complete interpretation of society.

His equations fall apart when you talk about singularities, but nobody is saying that we should throw them out because of that one exception, right?

We are pre-judging outcomes. We have to make certain assumptions to make it through the day without overwhelming ourselves. The sun will rise.

Take them at their word and allow their actions to determine whether or not they are trustworthy.\n\n4. Always do your beast means keep trying even when you might not want to.

Honestly, when somebody says something like \"I overcame [life disaster] by the grace of this self-help book I found/was given\", I don't cheer against their victory or anything, but I always imagine that, when you're at a super low point, pretty much any alternative is welcome. So like, while the advice itself may not be especially good or philosophically complete, it might, for one reason or another, help you to, say, stay off heroin. The result speaks for itself, so you aren't too picky in hindsight about how you got there, because *sloppy philosophy that helps you stay clean is better than relapsing*. It's a lesson in not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\nBut then to the second, I don't want to attribute any more profundity to the advice than is necessary. I've been acquainted with some New Age types, and I've ended up reading a lot of that stuff just to try and get inside the heads of people who are trying to sell me on it (I did not finish this book, I grant that), and part of me gets the impression these lessons are typically both signposted and explained in such vague language that, with enough willpower and charitable interpretation, the bare phrasing can be retrofitted to your existing beliefs in a way that seems like something is \"clicking\", or like you're having an \"Aha!\" moment.\n\nIt's sort of like what happens with cold reading/horoscopes--your intuitions are primed by deliberately ambiguous language so you latch on and start pumping in your own information, and you feel like there's some kind of connection there when it's really just your own thoughts being repackaged and delivered to you. I don't deny the potential *efficacy* of self-help, but I deny the source of the advice: the benign things these Agreements are being interpreted as invoking are things I imagine already occur to pretty much everyone on some level, even if they get caught up in trying to justify doing the opposite--the fundamental takeaway just seems to be a special case of \"don't be an asshole\". If you're known as a serial liar, if you're super distrustful and hostile all the time, and if you half-ass everything you do, you're probably going to have a bad time. The reason you see virtues like these bubble up cross-culturally is because they're probably psychologically latent. If there's a more eloquent and spiritual-sounding packaging you can wrap them up in to remind people of something they probably already understand deep down, more power to them if it helps them get out of a dark place. But we don't have to pretend it's cutting-edge moral philosophy or a great wisdom.\n\nI guess I'm trying to look forward--like, it would be great if everyone cooperated and was really compassionate and stoic all the time, but the thing about most of the dispassionate sages is they weren't especially interested in worldly affairs, so thorough practice of their exalted virtues was a great strategy because they didn't have any real skin in the fight--they just accepted whatever the outcome was, self-satisfied their destiny was in the hands of Nature, or Fate, or one or more Gods, so whatever way things turned out was the way things either must be or ought to be. But for people who are immersed in the world, basic virtue templates probably aren't enough because you have to respond adequately to your environment to make it, so your strategy has to involve shrewdness and *some* amount of ruthless calculation, neither of which this advice prepares you for.", "id": "daidx33"}, {"comment": "rekt", "id": "daigdhs"}], [{"comment": "Thank you so much for this.

Then the monsters somehow just go away in the next books, never to be spoken of or heard from again.  Along with the evil tyrant guy.

This boy's a noble hero, this girl's a pretty diplomat, this man's a hardened veteran, blah blah blah.  \n\nThe author eventually had to release a book called the \"Lost Chronicles\" or some crap like that in order to fill the giant, gaping holes he left in the original books.  \"Wait...they're MARRIED now??

As I lack the capability to create a visual image in my mind my experience is primarily dependent on enjoying the plots; little facts, bit surprises, insightful characters; you name it.\n\nSo when the author takes two pages to describe a massive star ship controlled by an AI I do think that's cool but mostly wish dearly for him/her to move on with the plot.. It's the concepts what we're here for!\n\nThis is what makes Asimov's, The Last Question, work so well for me; every word of every sentence gives detail to the main concept. The closest he comes to descriptive visualisation is \"his face has lines of weariness on it\"; and that's something that has a direct meaning thus easy to take in.\n\nThe other side, the \"great books I don't get\", are exemplified in the Discworld novels; the short bits and anecdotes I read are fun.

The pinball problem is not to stop the ball before it\u2019s swallowed by the mouth at the bottom, or to kick it back to midfield like a halfback. The problem is to make it stay up where the lighted targets are more numerous and have it bounce from one to another, wandering, confused, delirious, but still a free agent. And you achieve this not by jolting the ball but by transmitting vibrations to the case, the frame, but gently, so the machine wont\u2019 catch on and say Tilt. You can only do it with the groin, or with a play of the hips that makes the groin not so much bump, as slither, keeping you on this side of an orgasm. And if the hips move according to nature, it\u2019s the buttocks that supply the forward thrust, but gracefully, so that when the thrust reaches the pelvic area, it is softened, as in homeopathy, where the more you shake a solution and the more the drug dissolves in the water added gradually, until the drug has almost entirely disappeared, the more medically effective and potent it is. Thus from the groin an infinitesimal pulse is transmitted to the case, and the machine obeys, the ball moves against nature, against inertia, against gravity, against the law of dynamics, and against the cleverness of its constructor, who wanted it disobedient. The ball is intoxicated with vis movendi, remaining in play for memorable and immemorial lengths of time. But a female groin is required, one that interposes no spongy body between the ileum and the machine, and there must be no erectile matter in between, only skin, nerves, padded bone sheathed in a pair of jeans, and a sublimated erotic fury, a sly frigidity, a disinterested adaptability to the partner\u2019s response, a taste for arousing desire without suffering the excess of one\u2019s own: the Amazon must drive the pinball crazy and savor the thought that she will then abandon it."], [220, "Outstanding essay, the part about syncretism is great:\n\n>This new culture had to be syncretistic.

Like what others have said, there's no need to justify, or rather there is no need to be defensive about your reading preferences. I have a friend who has a really different reading preference than I do. She enjoys reading non-fiction ( to which i do share similar interest in). However, when it comes to fiction she enjoys her classical literature, whereas I'm more of a fantasy buff and I know she has no interest in that whatsoever, and, to an extent, all other genres of fiction that i enjoy reading. Nevertheless I've never seen her as being a \"snob\" for only reading the classics, nor does she attempt to justify why she doesn't like to read fantasy (or any other genres). Basically, in a nutshell I believe that as long as you tell others how much you enjoy your subject matter, be it fiction or non-fiction, I don't see why you should further justify why you don't read certain types of books. It becomes condescending when you turn your nose and belittle others for reading/enjoying content that you don't but since you've established that I don't see how that is problematic.\n\nI suppose what I can suggest, since sometimes even the most well meaning comments can be misconstrued is that rather than saying \"I prefer reading non-fiction\" be more specific. Non-fiction is an extremely generalised genre and so many sub-topics could be placed under there.

However, when it comes to fiction she enjoys her classical literature, whereas I'm more of a fantasy buff and I know she has no interest in that whatsoever, and, to an extent, all other genres of fiction that i enjoy reading. Nevertheless I've never seen her as being a \"snob\" for only reading the classics, nor does she attempt to justify why she doesn't like to read fantasy (or any other genres). Basically, in a nutshell I believe that as long as you tell others how much you enjoy your subject matter, be it fiction or non-fiction, I don't see why you should further justify why you don't read certain types of books. It becomes condescending when you turn your nose and belittle others for reading/enjoying content that you don't but since you've established that I don't see how that is problematic.\n\nI suppose what I can suggest, since sometimes even the most well meaning comments can be misconstrued is that rather than saying \"I prefer reading non-fiction\" be more specific. Non-fiction is an extremely generalised genre and so many sub-topics could be placed under there.

Unlike other books I've read to challenge myself, or because I felt like I just *should*, I found myself actually laughing at this one, despite my confusion at what exactly was going on for the first couple of hundred pages.\n\nThe great thing about this book - or one of the great things - is that it is entirely successful in the way it overwhelms you with a bunch of information absent context at first, but then the further into the book you read, the more sense things you read *earlier* make. It works differently than most books - it's not a book where you mainly gather information that becomes useful later, it's a book that makes more sense *across* the book the further into it you get. All these scenes that seemed scattered and random and pointless suddenly make complete sense once you've read far enough.\n\nI also strongly related to the sections about alcoholism and addiction.

I ask because I watched the first two episodes along with listening to the podcast episodes and I can tell I'll have a lot of questions. I imagine others will as well now and as the podcast goes on.\n\nAnyway, one thing I wondered is what is the point of buying a casket if you are cremating a person? You mention in the second podcast episode that cremation requires a wooden casket as opposed to another material, but I always thought the person just got put in there on a shelf or something? It seems like a waste of money for anything but the bare minimum wood casket if it a requirement to have one at all.\n\nSecondly, how are the ashes collected for the urn? Are there traces of other diseased's ashes in there that get mixed in as the next person's is collected? \n\nThank you again for the podcast.

I was originally trying to use my post in the r/sixfeetunder sub to take thoughts, criticisms and start conversation, but I'll gladly answer your question here, as well as on my podcast, because I'm sure other people are just as interested in your question.\n\nSo to answer your first question, I said that the container has to be wood, and not metal. So, i'm answering this question for the state regulations that I know of, and it may be different elsewhere\u2026 But the crematory requires that a person is in a container - whether that be a cardboard container, or a wood casket, they must be IN something. Just place someone in a retort (where they are actually cremated) is somewhat....disrespectful? Undignified? So they must be placed in a container, and like I said, anywhere from an actual cardboard box (regulated & formed for a human body) up to the most expensive wood casket money could buy. In terms of pricing, a cardboard container would be your cheapest.\n\nTo answer your second question, on the forms that a family will sign, to actually give permission to the funeral home to cremate a loved one, there is a clause in there that creamains will commingle. So, after the cremation takes place, the crematory operator will open the retort, and for lack of a better word, sweep the cremains into a container - it is not ashes at this point - SOME ashes, but mostly bone particles - picture a degraded skeleton. They are transferred to a container, to go through processing, where the remaining particles are pulverized, and hence, turned into ashes. Now, because the nature of the environment in which a cremation takes place, some ashes/particles will be left behind in the retort - therefore a little of the previous cremation will end up in the next one. It's not a significant amount, I would say less than 1%, but the fact remains, cremains will commingle in the retort. But there should be a clause in the cremation authorization form, that makes you aware of this before the point. To otherwise change this, it would take a lot of time for cooling down + cleaning, thus increasing the cost. Therefore, if you can accept a very small amount of cremains will be mixed yours, then it will be ok.\n\nI hope I answered your questions, and I encourage any other questions as well\u2026 I will address this on my next podcast to give others the info I shared here.

Apparently the rules in the link you provided DO NOT apply to books. Authors are still free to give out advanced review copies and free copies of their books (outside of Amazon's free promo service they offer authors). There are services like instafreebie designed just for this purpose.\n\nThe only restriction in the book world, so I've heard, is that a reviewer must have spent $50 on Amazon - not per year or anything, just since they opened their account. \n\nNo way to prove whether they are enforcing this, but it's a very good stop-gap solution if they are. Many of the spam accounts aren't going to have a purchase history with Amazon. \n\nfyi - I'm a self-published author and I'd LOVE it if they can fix the review system. It's far worse than even the reddit post they reference in the article makes it sound. \n\nIronically, my first book has 17 reviews (11 on the US site), all five stars (all legit readers, no friends and family even). **I just got my first four-star review and was ecstatic!** Why? Because even though my reviews are not fake, when you have all five-star reviews it can look like maybe they are. \n\nSo good authors can get screwed simply for being good because there are so many scam reviews. \n\nTo make matters even worse....\n\n* Many promotion sites require 5-20 reviews before they'll promote a book (which is what forces authors to do scammy things). It took me almost a year to get 17 reviews... it's beyond frustrating and I can see why some authors go nuts and try to scam the system. I never did simply because I take my writing seriously and have no desire to trick readers or damage myself long term. But I can see why some authors would out of frustration. \n* Amazon rigs its own system. Self-pub books that are picked up by an Amazon imprint (they have about 8 such imprints I believe) get a massive rank bump to start them off (so they aren't really self-pub at that point though, they are amazon published books). No one else gets to start off at #10 in the store unless they have a TON of pre-orders or first-day orders. But amazon imprint books seem to get to do just that (maybe there's more to it that I'm missing, but that seems to be the case). \n\n\nPeople are going to hate this, but you know the easiest way to stop all this? LEAVE REVIEWS. \n\nSeriously. The reason the review system is so easily scammed is because no one leaves reviews (at least with books). The average rate of reviewing a book is something crazy like 1 in 1,000. \n\nWhen people leave reviews the scam reviews become very obvious. A book with 100 5-stars **and** 100 1 and 2 stars... it becomes obvious the author is paying for reviews. \n\nNot only does it help the author when you leave reviews, but more importantly, it help other consumers. \n\nI know people hate leaving reviews, but that's the #1 thing you can do to actually make the review system better.

Authors are still free to give out advanced review copies and free copies of their books (outside of Amazon's free promo service they offer authors). There are services like instafreebie designed just for this purpose.\n\nThe only restriction in the book world, so I've heard, is that a reviewer must have spent $50 on Amazon - not per year or anything, just since they opened their account. \n\nNo way to prove whether they are enforcing this, but it's a very good stop-gap solution if they are. Many of the spam accounts aren't going to have a purchase history with Amazon. \n\nfyi - I'm a self-published author and I'd LOVE it if they can fix the review system. It's far worse than even the reddit post they reference in the article makes it sound. \n\nIronically, my first book has 17 reviews (11 on the US site), all five stars (all legit readers, no friends and family even). **I just got my first four-star review and was ecstatic!** Why? Because even though my reviews are not fake, when you have all five-star reviews it can look like maybe they are. \n\nSo good authors can get screwed simply for being good because there are so many scam reviews. \n\nTo make matters even worse....\n\n* Many promotion sites require 5-20 reviews before they'll promote a book (which is what forces authors to do scammy things). It took me almost a year to get 17 reviews... it's beyond frustrating and I can see why some authors go nuts and try to scam the system. I never did simply because I take my writing seriously and have no desire to trick readers or damage myself long term. But I can see why some authors would out of frustration. \n* Amazon rigs its own system. Self-pub books that are picked up by an Amazon imprint (they have about 8 such imprints I believe) get a massive rank bump to start them off (so they aren't really self-pub at that point though, they are amazon published books). No one else gets to start off at #10 in the store unless they have a TON of pre-orders or first-day orders. But amazon imprint books seem to get to do just that (maybe there's more to it that I'm missing, but that seems to be the case). \n\n\nPeople are going to hate this, but you know the easiest way to stop all this? LEAVE REVIEWS. \n\nSeriously. The reason the review system is so easily scammed is because no one leaves reviews (at least with books). The average rate of reviewing a book is something crazy like 1 in 1,000. \n\nWhen people leave reviews the scam reviews become very obvious. A book with 100 5-stars **and** 100 1 and 2 stars... it becomes obvious the author is paying for reviews. \n\nNot only does it help the author when you leave reviews, but more importantly, it help other consumers. \n\nI know people hate leaving reviews, but that's the #1 thing you can do to actually make the review system better.

Then factor in how royalties differ between hardbacks and paperbacks - and the inverse relationship with how most people purchase their books.   Torrents do not result in any money reaching the author and are pretty blatant theft, which is why I personally do not support it. At least with used book sales, the original sale provided author income. Speaking from professional and familial experience, most publishers and authors love libraries buying their books.

Like it was written for a stage play or a movie. That quality of \"yeah, nobody actually talks or acts like that\". Lynch is more in line with more modern writing like Rothfuss or Scalzi. You get the feeling that if magic was real and that world existed, so would those people. The characters are interesting and flawed without descending into caricatures or \"character pre-fabs\".

It's a strange little book to say the least and totally defies standard storytelling expectations. The narrative is not very straightforward. Several things in it can leave you scratching your head and raising an eyebrow and would require you to \"read between the lines\". It plays with your perception of time, space, and reality. It draws on some classic fairy tales like The Twelve Dancing Princesses and Rapunzel but adds a macabre twist to them. And yes, it also frequently shifts from one character's perspective to that of another. It's quite a weird and cryptic book on the surface, but it's not difficult to detect some underlying themes like gender, sexuality, politics, and religion. \n\nAnd while I'm not sure if it fits the bill, I'd also suggest [*The French Lieutenant's Woman*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56034.The_French_Lieutenant_s_Woman) by John Fowles. It's basically historical metafiction. The story's set in the backdrop of the Victorian age but it's filtered through a modern lens and is frequently self-referential. Instead of attempting to create the 'illusion' that the events in the novel are taking place in 'reality', like most traditional narrators do, the author deliberately breaks the 'illusion' by drawing the reader's attention to the fact that the story is but a 'construct'.

I'm still trying to decide if there was simply something lost in translation, because it was originally in French and referenced a time period in France that I'm simply not familiar with, but didn't go into enough detail to explain what was going on. It seemed like nothing really happened, and when the narrator should have been feeling emotions, he seemed completely detached and disinterested. I didn't see the point of any of it.\n\nI might actually be angrier at *Pretty Girls* by Karin Slaughter and *A Partial History of Lost Causes* by Jennifer duBois. The former started with an interesting premise but quickly turned totally clich\u00e9 (woman married a man with a ~secret life~ which was very cringeworthy and tragedy-porny). The latter was more promising, had an amazing title and could have been a really fascinating post-Soviet political intrigue. Instead, the two main characters were so abysmally self-absorbed that I ended up hating them both and the plot fizzled without taking advantage of any of the interesting opportunities of the premise.

It's a play, and while Delillo is a hugely celebrated novelist, as a playwright, he leaves a lot to be desired.

And it's hilarious how Young builds his foundation of world rockin' realizations by making Jesus a Jew with a big nose and a dislike of religion, and God a big black southern mama named Papa (SO RADICAL). This book is preachy garbage with no plot or direction. The dialogue is weird and forced, the use of similes is sophomoric, and the main character Mack is only interesting because his daughter was murdered. A giant meteor would have been a more interesting ending to this (lack of a) story.  I could go on and on but I've already written too much. Young says he never intended to write a book which is very, very obvious after reading whatever The Shack is. \n\n\nI'm glad that people found solace in this book, I really am.

"], [1, "This is my all-time favorite book, and every time I finish reading it I have to resist the urge to go back to page 1 and start over. If I had to pick a favorite author, I think Neal Stephenson would be it.\n\nStephenson has a style of writing that, if it isn't unique, is at least rare. I'm going to be talking about this style, which is a hallmark of most of his books and is especially evident in Diamond Age, but I wouldn't consider this to be spoiling anything. Read on if you want.\n\nWhat I like most about Stephenson's style is how grows stories. Usually in fiction the story is initiated by some huge outside event -- the protagonist's parents are killed, or he is chosen to compete in \"the games\", a murder happens and needs solving, a war starts, a spaceship crashes, or a ring that has sat in trunk for decades suddenly needs destroying. After we get to know the characters is when some external force injects energy into the story to get things going. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with that model, but I find it much more interesting the way Stephenson does it. He introduces us to a few characters. They may have small challenges they are trying to overcome, but it seems like these are the regular challenges of everyday life. Failures or successes in these small challenges slowly start bending the paths of these characters together. As they come together, differences or similarities in what they are trying to achieve creates conflict. The point is there is something intrinsic to the characters that drives events to build in the story arc, rather than an external event. \n\nAs I think about it, I guess it's the difference between character and story driven storytelling. And I like being to see the path a regular person takes from ordinary existence to achieving great things. They lift themselves up, and that's inspiring.\n\nI\u2019m not going to go so far as to say this method is better, but it\u2019s better for me. I like it a lot more. Stephenson\u2019s books exhibit this characteristic to greater or lesser *ahemReamde* extent.  \n\nAnother thing I won\u2019t get into is how he tries to educate his readers about some principal, like cryptography, electronic engineering, economy, pollution, social progress, authority, or what have you. I think this can come across as preachy, and that makes a lot of people disengage, along with his wordiness.

If I had to pick a favorite author, I think Neal Stephenson would be it.\n\nStephenson has a style of writing that, if it isn't unique, is at least rare. I'm going to be talking about this style, which is a hallmark of most of his books and is especially evident in Diamond Age, but I wouldn't consider this to be spoiling anything. Read on if you want.\n\nWhat I like most about Stephenson's style is how grows stories. Usually in fiction the story is initiated by some huge outside event -- the protagonist's parents are killed, or he is chosen to compete in \"the games\", a murder happens and needs solving, a war starts, a spaceship crashes, or a ring that has sat in trunk for decades suddenly needs destroying. After we get to know the characters is when some external force injects energy into the story to get things going. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with that model, but I find it much more interesting the way Stephenson does it. He introduces us to a few characters. They may have small challenges they are trying to overcome, but it seems like these are the regular challenges of everyday life. Failures or successes in these small challenges slowly start bending the paths of these characters together. As they come together, differences or similarities in what they are trying to achieve creates conflict. The point is there is something intrinsic to the characters that drives events to build in the story arc, rather than an external event. \n\nAs I think about it, I guess it's the difference between character and story driven storytelling. And I like being to see the path a regular person takes from ordinary existence to achieving great things. They lift themselves up, and that's inspiring.\n\nI\u2019m not going to go so far as to say this method is better, but it\u2019s better for me. I like it a lot more. Stephenson\u2019s books exhibit this characteristic to greater or lesser *ahemReamde* extent.  \n\nAnother thing I won\u2019t get into is how he tries to educate his readers about some principal, like cryptography, electronic engineering, economy, pollution, social progress, authority, or what have you. I think this can come across as preachy, and that makes a lot of people disengage, along with his wordiness.

I've found that, when people of color are published, their books tend not to be about what I want to read, which  depresses me because I want to support them! Specifically, I feel like I really should read more black authors but most of the literary fiction published by black authors tends to be about immigration, race, civil rights/slavery or \"the struggle\" and I am just burnt out on all those things. It's essentially the only damn narrative we're allowed to have in the media and I'm just over that being our only stories because we have so much more to tell.  Books about African immigrants trying to make it in America just don't do it for me and I get annoyed/bored ('Americanah' did this to me) and books about the slave trade/colonialism/race drain the fuck out of me and not in a good way ('Homegoing' did this to me).

Recent female-written noir focuses more on the victim, the relationship she had with the killer, and often a long period of psychological abuse before the physical violence escalated.  Nordic noir is more of a procedural, where a detective (probably facing or just coming off of some personal crisis) plods through the day-to-day work to piece together someone's secret past.

I guess I'm just looking for more insight into how the selections were made, especially given the grandiose statements you're making here!

Castle though is super original - it's kind of a ghost story, kind of a coming-of-age story, kind of a story about witches and small-town superstition and one of the most visceral portrayals of agoraphobia and this really cool \"was it magical or is everybody just losing their minds\" ambiguity that is hugely influential in the horror/suspense genre. I'd say Hill House is mega influential in its own way, but I would also surface Castle as a really great novel that shouldn't be overlooked! \n\nNight Film - Marisha Pessl                \nThis is a great example of \"new horror\" - that contemporary take on the genre that lifts a lot of inspiration from found footage horror films, actually - *House of Leaves* is another big player in this niche, and Night Film is a lesser-known example of the kind of heady, real-feeling horror novel that has a lot of photographic inserts and \"screencaps\" from \"real web pages\" and such that make it a really immersive experience. Really cool example of what's being done with the genre right now. \n\n(Oh, and while I'm talking at you about new horror and Shirley Jackson and \"found documents\" writing - Jeff VanderMeer's *Annihilation* is a great modern novel that takes the spirit of Shirley Jackson's haunted house novels and runs with it in a sci-fi direction. Lots of great female characters, too.)\n\nThe Accursed - Joyce Carol Oates           \nJoyce Carol Oates' influence in contemporary horror writing is really underrated compared to contemporaries like Stephen King; anyone claiming to love horror novels should pick up something of hers and The Accursed is a cool starting point. It's an older \"found document\" style novel - the conceit is that it's a presidential biographer writing about Woodrow Wilson's time as a university president during a zombie/vampire plague outbreak, but there's also a lot of cool thematic stuff around racial prejudice and class issues in New England society. If you read a lot of horror you'll definitely recognize the aesthetic that pops up in stuff like Pride & Prejudice & Zombies now. \n\nHousekeeping or Home - Marilynne Robinson (similar titles, very different books - Home is technically a companion to the equally-excellent Gilead, but it can be read alone)     \nRobinson should be on any \"best of the 20th/21st century\" writers list, in my opinion. She's one of those authors who writes about \"humble\" topics - midwestern small town folks just getting by, pastors reflecting back on their careers in retirement, etc - and she's incredible for her ability to turn the simplest scenes into poetry. I literally have cried reading a paragraph about the spray from a sprinkler creating a rainbow effect (*Gilead*), her writing is so meditative yet sparse. She's one of those very talented authors who is able to address \"universal\" themes (not just the feminist themes you'd generally expect on a female authors list but stuff like mortality, the human condition, forgiveness, regret, etc). For the writing alone I'd recommend this, she's been super influential in terms of what critics look for in \"literary\" novels today. \n\nA Tale for the Time Being - Ruth Ozeki, criminally overlooked!         \nThis is one of those books that manages to both handle some really, really heavy themes and be super funny and readable. She's also one of those writers who blends down to earth straightforward slice-of-life writing with magical elements - you can see this kind of stuff in Helen Oyeyemi's work as well, or in books like The Association of Small Bombs that is winning a lot of recognition this year. It's also a really interesting take on the whole \"immigrant experience\" genre as it's about an American-born teenager of Japanese ancestry moving \"back\" to Japan with her parents after her dad loses his tech job. It's one of those books that manages to both wreck you emotionally and really uplift you. The author is also just a wonderful, very thoughtful person with a really cool outlook on life - she herself is Canadian-Japanese and a lot of her own experiences have been worked into the book. I've read all of her novels save one, and ATftTB is by far my favorite. It's one of those books that pops up frequently when you're looking for top novels of the past 5 years. \n\nBoy Snow Bird - Helen Oyeyemi     \nThis one is an underrated stand out in the \"dark twist on a fairy tale\" niche - Oyeyemi writes a lot of books setting racial issues against supernatural themes, and this one is great - it's a Snow White-esque novel about a white woman who marries a white-passing black man (not realizing he's black), adopting his white-passing daughter as her stepdaughter, and is shocked when their child is born with dark skin. \n\nThe Fifth Season - NK Jemisin     \nGreat example of modern black fantasy/sci-fi, in the tradition of authors like Octavia Butler and Nnedi Okorafor who try to work in a lot of nonwhite characters and like to base their fantasy universes on non-western lore and history. Another great set of hers is The Shadowed Sun/The Killing Moon, which is explicitly based more around Egyptian/African lore rather than your typical elves/goblins/wizards type fantasy. Really cool niche to explore, especially if you're already familiar with western fantasy mainstays and are looking for something fresh and different. \n\nHowl's Moving Castle - Diana Wynne Jones     \nThis book could be said to have started it all when it comes to new spins on fairy tales in YA writing - super original fairy tale type fantasy that's very funny and sweet, with the strong-willed, self-sustaining, get-it-done young female heroine type we know and mostly-love in YA chosen girl fiction these days. If you've seen the Miyazaki film of the same name don't expect the works to be very similar - Miyazaki basically took the basic concept of HMC and totally rewrote it. I quite like both. \n\nMy Cousin Rachel - Daphne du Maurier          \nRebecca was already on OP's list and I love that one; I'd suggest MCR as an ideal companion work. It's a little more developed and riffs on a lot of similar themes, while maintaining that pulpy fast-paced is-this-a-romance-or-a-crime-novel style that du Maurier is best known for. \n\nThe Member of the Wedding or The Heart is a Lonely Hunter - Carson McCullers           \nMcCullers is one of the greatest, most underrated writers of the mid-20th century, period! Really excellent small town gothic type writing (think Harper Lee, if Scout was 13 and hooking up with the neighbor boys and breaking into her dad's liquor cabinet - McCullers was a predecessor/contemporary of Lee's and I find their writing styles and character types to be really similar). She really captures that certain middle America during a specific time period feel, and she was one of the first writers to advocate for not only women's rights and black civil rights but also gay rights and to prominently feature disabled characters. The Member of the Wedding is one of my favorites, it's a short little book about a 12yo girl on summer break, experiencing that weird phase of adolescence where she's too mature to really hang out with the little kids in her neighborhood anymore or hang off the maid's apron strings all the time, but isn't old enough yet to really relate to the teenagers and their talk about kissing and dates and whatever. She's not really sure of her relationship with her dad anymore given that she's too old to sleep in his bed and whatnot now and her big brother is getting married and leaving her behind as well in a way! \n\n", "id": "daocmwh"}, {"comment": "(continuing as my comment length went over the top)\n\nFun Home - Alison Bechdel            \nHyperbole and a Half - Allie Brosh        \nThese two are super influential in contemporary comics, especially autobiographical - Bechdel focuses a lot on the lives of women and her own relationship with her parents (both re: coming out as gay + in general) and Brosh's book is a really touching (and at times hilarious) look at depression. \n\nState of Wonder - Ann Patchett           \nPatchett could write a new spin on a phone book and I'd be unable to put it down. State of Wonder is about a female pharmaceutical company employee who travels to the Amazon rainforest where one of her old female professors is doing fertility research on a tribe whose women never experience menopause. She goes to retrieve the body of one of her coworkers, who went down to supervise research and died - and ends up of course finding more than she bargained for. It's one of those books where the premise sounds pretty straightforward but it ends up being really suspenseful due to all of the twists and turns as you find out more and more of the backstory and where these characters all stand with each other. Patchett is super influential in the modern literary community and her writing is grade-A. I also really love *Bel Canto* by her, but SoW gets a leg up as one of the best books I've read this year. I actually read it in tandem with /u/Beecakeband who I met on this sub! \n\nThe Shipping News - Annie Proulx         \nAnother super influential contemporary writer - Proulx is better known for *Brokeback Mountain* but I really liked The Shipping News for its portrayal of a lot of oddball, sympathetic characters. I'd describe it as Fargo-esque, for a movie comparison - it's about a widower and his daughter who move to an isolated port town in Newfoundland to be near his aunt. He starts working at a local newspaper and meets a lot of weirdos; it's definitely a slice of life type novel rather than a plot-driven one.

I'm not sure what kind of eyesight problems your grandmother has, but it was one of the things that helped immediately.

However, I do have to say that there is no guarantee that they will work as well as we hope; but that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying.\n\nFirst thing first: Why is she struggling to read? Different conditions tend to have certain devices that work better for each patient. Is it macular degeneration? If so, she might actually need an eye exam because if she was suddenly unable to read, when she was previously able to, that makes me concerned that there might be new blood vessel growth where there should not be, and thus needs treatment. Sudden progression worries me. \n\nNext thing: With elderly patients, everything needs to be hands-free and stable on it's own. GOOD LIGHTING IS KEY. Daylight lamps and lighted stand magnifiers can make a big difference. When you mention that there's something about screens that she can't process, that might be the glare. I wouldn't recommend the iPad, but some of the E-readers might work for her. I work pretty closely with Enhanced Vision's product line and they are PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. The CCTVs are great because you can change the contrast and bump up the magnification without losing quality (which can be the problem with stand magnifiers...there's a limit to how large you can really make the print with lenses and still be able to functionally read something). \n\nLarge print books aren't always available, but searching amazon for \"large print books\" may yield results. \n\nNext, check out your local Lighthouse for the Blind. They offer rehab and Low Vision services and products, and if she's disabled, she might be able to get some of the things she needs on scholarship or for heavily reduced prices. So that's something else to consider. \n\nIf you're not sure where to look, I would search for \"low vision optometrist\" or \"low vision ophthalmologist\". Low Vision, as a specialty, is NOT about getting the patient to 20/20 vision, it's about giving them tools to reach specific goals, such as \"to be able to read my books\". So I would look into that for sure for her, because the entire goal of the exams is to improve quality of life.

However, I do have to say that there is no guarantee that they will work as well as we hope; but that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying.\n\nFirst thing first: Why is she struggling to read? Different conditions tend to have certain devices that work better for each patient. Is it macular degeneration? If so, she might actually need an eye exam because if she was suddenly unable to read, when she was previously able to, that makes me concerned that there might be new blood vessel growth where there should not be, and thus needs treatment. Sudden progression worries me. \n\nNext thing: With elderly patients, everything needs to be hands-free and stable on it's own. GOOD LIGHTING IS KEY. Daylight lamps and lighted stand magnifiers can make a big difference. When you mention that there's something about screens that she can't process, that might be the glare. I wouldn't recommend the iPad, but some of the E-readers might work for her. I work pretty closely with Enhanced Vision's product line and they are PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. The CCTVs are great because you can change the contrast and bump up the magnification without losing quality (which can be the problem with stand magnifiers...there's a limit to how large you can really make the print with lenses and still be able to functionally read something). \n\nLarge print books aren't always available, but searching amazon for \"large print books\" may yield results. \n\nNext, check out your local Lighthouse for the Blind. They offer rehab and Low Vision services and products, and if she's disabled, she might be able to get some of the things she needs on scholarship or for heavily reduced prices. So that's something else to consider. \n\nIf you're not sure where to look, I would search for \"low vision optometrist\" or \"low vision ophthalmologist\". Low Vision, as a specialty, is NOT about getting the patient to 20/20 vision, it's about giving them tools to reach specific goals, such as \"to be able to read my books\". So I would look into that for sure for her, because the entire goal of the exams is to improve quality of life.

Using a colored light won't really help do that. Some patients do benefit from the use of different filters to cut down on glare, but it's a lot more trial and error because every patient has a different goal and different needs based on how their disease has progressed. \n\nFor macular degeneration, orange and yellow lenses tend to help with depth perception and contrast. Grey lenses help cut down on glare.\n\nUltimately, I don't think that different colored lighting provides quite as much benefit as a bright white light. Shining a blue or a red or an orange light on a white page with black text is going to decrease the contrast.

If you're not constantly reading, your mind isn't running on the fuel of story. You're not learning what you like and what you don't like. You're not figuring out what your voice is. You are what you eat--what goes in comes out. Read outside your preferred genre. Non-fiction, crime, romance. Most novels contain elements of every genre in them. Someone once said that to write one book you have to turn over half a library and it's so true.\n\nI find that when I've let myself read too much Reddit and other social media and not enough narrative, my internal voice sounds like a Reddit comment, which is no bueno for writing novels, really. I have to go back to taking in words, not just putting them out. And in engaging with other fiction, the wheels always start turning again.\n\nAs for challenging yourself, well, this is what I did with Radiance. I had an idea that I was simply not a good enough writer to tackle back in 2008. I had to learn. I had to experiment. I had to grow and evolve.

I once had to write a story in the style of Hemingway and I cried.\n\nWhen it comes to mythology and folklore and such, I don't have to do a lot of research because my whole life has been researching those fields. They've been my obsession since I learned to read. It's just right *there*, I can reach for it anytime.\n\nWhen it comes to writing science fiction, historical fantasy, or indeed any fantasy more rooted in mathematics, philosophy, science, I have to do a lot more. I didn't study the sciences in college more than the requirements for my major, so it takes awhile to acquire and collate the information into a usable form. I took programming lessons in order to write about AI, for example, which taught me that I should never be a programmer. I strive to get things right. I talk to people who know more than I do. (I had a fabulous conversation with Seanan McGuire about deadly viruses and how to cure/not cure them last week, it was a blast.) If I'm writing a military book, I go shoot guns, I talk to my friends who are in active service, I read books written by soldiers. I go to Haworth before I write about the Brontes.

He's a guy who sees things from a different perspective, and society ostracizes him for it. How dare he not show emotion in the prescribed way, even if it isn't in his heart? Surely he loved his mother, but in his own way. \n\nAs somebody who's autistic, I see a lot of myself in Mersault. We have feelings. We have empathy. We just show them in different ways that society's conventions don't often pick up on. Mersault has a sort of disconnect with the \"normal\" people around him. Though they all come from the same place, he is a stranger among them."], [10, "*The Stranger* is basically a reductio ad, well, absurdum. It takes an absurdist character (i.e. someone who believes that there's no deeper meaning to be found in life) and, with the the help of extremely unfortunate events, makes a statement about how people like Meursault would fair in society. \n\nCamus once said that *The Stranger* is about how \"any man who does not weep at his mother's funeral runs the risk of being sentenced to death.\" While that was obviously a hyperbole (which he later expanded upon) you can see this sentiment in the story. \n\nIf Meursault's feeling and actions were more in tune with society, he would've condemned Raymond for beating his girlfriend and thus wouldn't have associated with him. This would've prevented him from even getting into the situation with the Arabs. Likewise, if he had shown remorse and guilt regarding the murder, he could've probably convinced the chaplain to put in a good word in court and save him from the death penalty. He could've easily claimed to have been emotionally unstable and generally confused following the death of his mother. But he didn't, because he wasn't. "], [5, "To me, Mersault is living his life in his own way, but the society around him sees him living it in their own perspective which leads to the conflict.

I also read it for school, specifically my IB English Literature class. Meursault is ... odd. He is inherently alien, he is the stranger after all. I've heard someone describe the range of human emotion as a scale between 1 and 100, with most people going between 30 and 70 most of the time. On such a scale Meursault would usually hover between 45 and 55, and that's being generous. I feel like the word sociopath is a broad term that we externally apply on people, perhaps too often, but I do think that if Meursault had his trial today, people would definitely use it to describe him. That does not however mean that Camus had that very idea in mind when creating the character. Let's be careful to apply our current culture's archetypes onto characters that come from a different time, as we may lose some intricacies by doing so.\n Meursault's distance from the average person does affect him, I think that this in combination with his fear is what fills him with so much hate by the end of the book. The line \"For the first time in years I felt the stupid urge to cry\" because \"I realized that everyone in the room hated me\" really struck me. Unlike the prosecutor would have us think, I don't believe Meursault is a pure monster. I am sympathetic to his character, despite his many \"antisocial\" qualities there are things that make him likeable (besides of course simply being the main character). Meursault takes joy in many things in life, despite his overall subdued and weak emotions. Unlike Raymond for example, Meursault rarely thinks about hurting people or getting any sort of revenge, which is part of the reason his murder is so perplexing. As a side note he has a few hilarious lines \"She told me to call the police, I told her I didn't like cops\". A big question I had from early on in the book was if he had always been the way he is, the answer to this comes in two parts. Firstly, he does say that he was full of all sorts of ambitions when he was a student, but he was forced to give them up and found him self happy enough without them. Second, and more importantly he let's us in on something very telling during the trial: \"I had never been able to truly feel remorse for anything\". This to me is a key part of his character, he simply goes along with life, whatever happens to anyone. His mother's death was a mildly bad day to him. Only the threat of imminent death, the end to the life which it is in his nature to simply float through, and what he perceives to be the hatred of all of mankind, can get truly stir up intense, soul-wrenching emotions in him. We don't know what happens to Meursault for sure, my sympathy for him makes me hope his appeal is granted, as that is at least somewhat plausible, but ultimately this story is not really about his very end, he could die the next day or 30 years from then. The story (at least when focusing solely on his character, and not any statements it may be making about socienty as a whole) is rather about his emotional arc, from being incapable of feeling anything other than content, irritation, and desire to full of desperate hope and misanthropic hate. If he survived, it's hard to say whether this change would be permanent, I think that is more left up to us to think about. As far as the murder itself, that does perplex me more than anything else. Perhaps that was the result of Meursault reaching an emotional height he wasn't used to, he was extremely stressed, all his friends were scared, and he saw the man he may have perceived as causing it all sitting right in front of him. He didn't understand taking such an action, it was so unfamiliar to him, that he externalized the cause, blaming the physical irritation he was experiencing for his actions. That's just the best I understand it."]], [[{"comment": "Mersault, to me, is not a sociopath. He's a guy who sees things from a different perspective, and society ostracizes him for it. How dare he not show emotion in the prescribed way, even if it isn't in his heart? Surely he loved his mother, but in his own way. \n\nAs somebody who's autistic, I see a lot of myself in Mersault. We have feelings. We have empathy. We just show them in different ways that society's conventions don't often pick up on. Mersault has a sort of disconnect with the \"normal\" people around him.

Different conceptions of psychopathy have been used throughout history. These conceptions are only partly overlapping and may sometimes be contradictory.[2]*\n\nI suppose it depends if you deem a disconnect with the  predominant culture as anti-social, or if you determine that anti-social must mean intent to buck the system rather than one who simply harbors a minority point of view. As for the case of impaired empathy, I stated that I don't feel Mersault fits that. He has empathy, but his empathy is not expressed in the same way as that predominant social culture.

If you're going by impaired empathy, then that still requires, by the very definition of the word, a base. His empathy has to be impaired in comparison to someone or something. And I'd say that that has to be society.\n\n> My distinction is that, in plain terms, there's a difference between a callous, uncaring individual who does not want to be part of society, and someone who simply does not fit in with those around him.\n\nThere is, but I think it just shows that we assume sociopath to mean something inherently evil. Meursault wasn't a bad person for the overwhelmingly most part, but he was (in my eyes at least) anti-social in every sense of the word. At various steps he acted the exact opposite way to someone you'd would describe as social. He didn't cry at his mother's wake. He did not think of the implications when his girlfriend asked him about marriage. He didn't show remorse or guilt after he shot a man. That is anti-social behavior.", "id": "dai231t"}, {"comment": "Just for fun, what would you think of him if the story took place in a society of people who were just like him?

This would've prevented him from even getting into the situation with the Arabs. Likewise, if he had shown remorse and guilt regarding the murder, he could've probably convinced the chaplain to put in a good word in court and save him from the death penalty.

Now, unlike Dickens, he is practically disregarded. He is little read and is almost never taught in schools and colleges. These three stories, all centring on young English boys, might offer a clue as to why that is. The second of them, Baa Baa, Black Sheep, is the most Dickensian. The story of a well-loved little boy bullied by the adult entrusted by his mother to take over his care is almost identical to the early chapters of David Copperfield.

LoTR is much more timeless than Harry Potter, and Shakespeare is more widely regarded than Dickens, despite the prose being completely obtuse by today's standards. People don't read 500 year old (or 100 year old) books for a quick jaunt.\n\nI would say thematic considerations are the best bet. LoTR jumps out in Fantasy, perhaps Dune if the sequels weren't so rough. Stranger in a Strange Land and PKD's stuff will endure for at least 100 years in the popular mix, I believe. That's just for Science Fiction. ", "id": "damob93"}, {"comment": "No, of course success doesn't matter directly. But success can be indicative of the thing in question containing something of value. It isn't alone a good measurement, but for someone to sustain interest the interest of millions of readers across seven main books over the course of ten years is no mean feat, not to mention the cultural interest in the HP world as a whole extending all the way to the current day with the new play and Magical Beasts movie(s). Hype in a thing can typically only sustain sales for a few years, though more is obviously possible (that case can and has been made that the epicenter of Beatlemania lasted about five years). All of this is purely speculative, but the case can be made that HP tapped into some feeling or mythic narrative trajectory that many modern people find fundamentally motivating, much the way the story of a Jewish political insurgent with a message of salvation had been executed for his rebellion tapped into many of the anxieties people thereafter had. Other stories of the last fifty years  resonate strongly with many (e.g. The Trial, Waiting for Godot, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, etc) for various reasons in the political, social, economical, or existential realms. Other stories tap on to other ideals, such as how Ahab chasing his white whale, Tony Stark becoming Iron Man, and the mythos around Michael Jordan seem to have cached in on a desire for the pursuit of greatness that can only be achieved by the individual on his or her own terms (or perhaps merely witnessing that pursuit is good enough to satiate). But not many stories seem to catch on so widely, across so many cultures and subcultures as Harry Potter has (translated into 65+ languages; who knows how many people have just read them, listened to them, or watched the films).\n\n\nNow, one of the things frequently talked about in this thread has been how explicitly tied to a time and a place a text can be, fiction seemingly especially so, just in a more subtle way. But written history has demonstrated ad nauseam how a people-group's valued works of popular culture are quick to become social currency and to be traded, even if the significance and interpretation of said work differs drastically from one people-group to another. The bible is a perfect example of this (and I'm not calling it fiction, but most of it reads more like fiction than say a college text book), in as far as it it has remained consistently relevant for 1,600 years all through a myriad of forms that it has taken since canonization (and far, far longer if you count its bits and pieces that were circulated on parchment and papyrus, and being circulated orally prior to that. It will be very hard to forget about Harry Potter at any point in the next few hundreds of year.\n\n\nAlso, I would say it's influence on other texts is not explicitly relevant to it's survival as one of the \"greats\" unless a profound interests in the  origins of a genre exists.

Before this year, I very rarely read graphic novels but I had more time to read this year and so I asked friends for suggestions and a lot of them were graphic novels.

If I miss a month I feel like I can't continue the story.\n\nI think 14 of the books are non-fiction, which is a lot for me.  I also tried to branch out with fiction, as I tend to read horror and fantasy.  This year I read a book about a MTF transgender high school kid, I read a few books that were translated into English, and I read a play.\n\nI really liked *The Bell Jar* and *The Bazaar of Bad Dreams*.

", "id": "dahkzn4"}, {"comment": "> In my opinion, he comes so close to stating that there is a moral imperative to returning violence given with even greater violence\n\nI think it would likely be impossible for Fanon to suggest greater violence than was already being perpetrated. You had a situation where in Algeria a settler could kill a native for whatever reason they liked, without any ramification, and these men were given arms and at the point of colonial dissent, carte blanche to kill as many as needed, essentially hunting season.\n\nFanon understood that colonialists would never under any circumstances relinquish power. Fanon understood that there could be no asking the master to leave a world where he owned everything, from the land to the people, and could do what he wanted with any of it. That violence was not a carnival of violence, he wasn't endorsing torture, or sadism, he wasn't endorsing what colonists did to them or what imperialists did to one-another. But he understood you need mass mobilisation and a total engagement.\n\nYou're dealing with people who incinerated Dresden, Tokyo, and so many others, in vengeance. What exactly is this 'greater violence'.\n\nThere's this liberal 'balanced' mindset where something like dropping white phosphorus on civilians is self-defence, firebombing wooden cities or nuking civilian targets is 'tactical' and 'measured', but the idea of colonised people who are non-human in that system, rise up and drive out the people that count the rape and murder of these non-humans as legal, is you know, 'too far', or 'barbarism'. In such cases it's clear that people have achieved a pretty spectacular cognitive dissonance. Perhaps this doesn't apply to you at all, perhaps you're just mistaken in what 'greater violence' against people who do not even rank you as human and treat you as such means.\n\nLook up what the French did in Algeria. Tell me exactly in what ways that level of violence - the depravity, etc - was ever, ever surpassed.\n\nAlso fwiw while Fanon had died at this point, his widow broke with Sartre over his continued support of the Israeli project.

The very stamp of modern Japanese literature exists because the Meiji Restoration in 1868 allowed for a permeation of Western influences.\n\nThe father of modern Japanese literature, Netsuke Soseki was educated in England and used English works as influence.\n\nMany of Junichiro Tanizaki's works specifically dealt with Western influences and his 1920s output involved flapper girls, jazz, and American music.\n\nKenzaburo Oe, the only living Japanese Nobel in Literature recipient, takes nearly no influence from Japanese literature and instead writes prose specifically styled after William Blake and various French authors (he studied French literature). He also frequently mentions Western films, novels, Vonnegut, and loads of French literature in his novels.\n\nMurakami's work vastly deals with Japanese topics. Many of his earlier novels are directly a reflection of the growing Japanese post-modern movement, in which works stopped being political and displayed a lack of goal, reflecting how many young graduates felt following the failure of the Japanese university protests of the late 1960s.\n\nHis works feature Yokai and aspects of shintoism, discuss the growing affect of commercialism on the Japanese psyche, and address modern Japanese terrorism organizations like Aum Shinrikyo. He frequently alludes to the works of Natsume Soskei and writes in a concise Japanese literary style similar too that of authors like Kawabata. He specifically writes using multiple forms of the Japanese \"I\" (watashi and boku) and by playing with Japanese language creates new ways for one to discuss themselves from multiple perspectives (this doesn't come across well in English translations).\n \nFurthermore, he's very clearly writing about Japanese life for Japanese people:\n\n> INTERVIEWER\n\n>Your writing is often talked about as being the most accessible Japanese literature for American readers, to the point that you yourself are described as the most Western of contemporary Japanese authors. I was wondering how you see your relationship to Japanese culture.\n\n>MURAKAMI\n\n>I don\u2019t want to write about foreigners in foreign countries; I want to write about us. I want to write about Japan, about our life here. That\u2019s important to me. Many people say that my style is accessible to Westerners; it might be true, but my stories are my own, and they are not Westernized.\n\n>INTERVIEWER\n\n>And many of the references that seem so Western to Americans\u2014the Beatles, for example\u2014are an integral part of the Japanese cultural landscape as well.\n\n>MURAKAMI\n\n>When I write about people eating a McDonald\u2019s hamburger, Americans wonder, Why is this character eating a hamburger instead of tofu? But eating a hamburger is very natural to us, an everyday thing.\n\n>INTERVIEWER\n\n>Would you say that your novels portray contemporary urban Japanese life accurately?\n\n>MURAKAMI\n\n>The way people act, the way people talk, the way people react, the way people think, is very Japanese. No Japanese readers\u2014almost no Japanese readers\u2014complain that my stories are different from our life. I\u2019m trying to write about the Japanese. I want to write about what we are, where we are going, why we are here.

The ones priced \u00a30.01 are usually mass market paperback versions. Pretty much nobody buys them, that's why the prices are so low, otherwise literally no one would buy them. Bottom line, there isn't as much profit in these books as you for some reason think there should be.\n\nAll that said, Amazon most definitely *can* and *does* have unoriginal products sold by third parties.

The mid-19th century was a turning point for fine dining, as the a la francaise (French) style of dining (where the meal was divided into just two or three courses and the food was attractively laid out on the table for diners to see) was being eclipsed by a new technique called service a la russe (Russian style), where courses were brought out individually in succession, each a presentation in itself. With its 17 courses, James Parkinson followed this new style for The Thousand Dollar Dinner, allowing his Philadelphia and New York guests to get a taste for what was trendy. Parkinson was also a tireless advocate for American foods, maintaining an \u201cAmerican style\u201d of cooking truly existed. He often incorporated indigenous American foods and recipes into his menus, including canvasback duck, terrapin, oysters, and rich Philadelphia-style ice cream. By showcasing these regional specialties, The Thousand Dollar Dinner helped establish the fact that America was beginning to assert some culinary influence. Today, it has spread throughout the world, sometimes fusing with the foods from other nations to provide a unique, global eating experience. Parkinson also promoted the use of local ingredients, a very popular concept these days,  with many people choosing and preferring fresh, local foods.", "id": "daog77x"}, {"comment": "Appreciate the information it's fascinating.
