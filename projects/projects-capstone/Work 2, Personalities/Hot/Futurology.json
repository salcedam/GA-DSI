A buffer is a solution that resists changes in equilibrium. Generally, in the past, when we've added energy to the ocean (as heat, co2, or other waste products), the ocean has absorbed that energy and nothing was really noticeable.\n\nBut buffers have a limit. The ocean is becoming more acidic. \n\n[This is a titration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UiuE7Xx5l8#t=0m35s), an analytical technique used to demonstrate the effectiveness of buffers, or determine unknown concentrations of chemicals using buffers of known strength.\n\nAs you can see, for a while when the pink indicator is added to the buffer solution, it disappears because the pH is too low for it to remain visible.\n\nAnd even when a high pH base is added, the pH remains low and the effects are hidden.\n\nBut then, suddenly, there's a tipping point.\n\nThe oceans are getting warmer. The oceans are getting more acidic. Soon (some argue already) there will be a tipping point where the ocean simply can't buffer any more of the changes. All those biotic carbon sinks will start to die, and release all the carbon the ocean has absorbed back into the atmosphere, further warming the ocean. Then the methane traps will melt, releasing a catastrophic amount of greenhouse gas.\n\nSo yes, the ocean is a significant player. That will fucking kill us.\n\n>This climate scare is to push policies and taxing mandates to the people. To line the pockets of politicians.

There's no way corporations and the wealthy would pay taxes that high; they already evade an enormous amount of taxes. \n\nYou could argue that the \"elite\" would band together and agree to pay this tax rate out of self preservation. Without a basic income, they can't sell anything, so they need to make it happen. But this presupposes far too much coordination and rationality in the \"elite\". If they were able to work together, plan ahead, and make decisions in such a logical manner (in order to avoid disasters that affect them all), we wouldn't have things like climate change, massive medical debts, and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those things all create a *net loss* to the economy, only benefiting a small subset of corporations and hurting all the others.\n\nAvoiding wide-scale disasters like 50% unemployment by automation requires all corporations to take a huge loss to profits, by voluntarily paying out insane sums to taxes. But if most corporations go ahead with the plan, then a few remaining corporations could cheat, evade taxes, and massively benefit from it. This is basic game theory: If everyone works together and takes a loss, then they all win in the long run. But if only a few people cheat, and exploit the cooperative loss, then the whole plan falls apart. By simple logic, everyone else has to refuse to take that voluntary loss. The inevitability of a small number of cheaters forces the entire group to cheat, effectively shooting the plan down.\n\nI would like to see this argument proven wrong. I'm not at all optimistic about the financial elite working together on a basic income, but I really hope they do.

Probably a little worse than collapse--it would just cease to be. Obviously there's a critical tipping point when suppliers realize their automation has snuffed out their demand.

How much do you care that ADM controls a lot of the food production in the US? Probably not much since relatively little of our economic output is in the form of wheat, corn, and other basic commodities. It's not that we've stopped production, more that the economy has moved on. The same will happen to our current economic system.\n\nIn the future all goods and services will be customized and niche.

Granted, about 25% goes to social security already, but the fact is that a low basic income would require the government to essentially double the tax rates. \n\nAlso consider that tax revenue couldn't be collected on the $10k given to each citizen, (otherwise you would've just given them $10k - taxes in the first place). So the only source of government revenue will come from corporate taxes and high income households. Guess who has a consistent track record of tax evasion? Corporations. \n\nSo a UBI will require the government to not only shift the tax burden entirely to the corporations and the wealthy, but to **double** it as well. There's no way corporations and the wealthy would pay taxes that high; they already evade an enormous amount of taxes. \n\nYou could argue that the \"elite\" would band together and agree to pay this tax rate out of self preservation. Without a basic income, they can't sell anything, so they need to make it happen. But this presupposes far too much coordination and rationality in the \"elite\". If they were able to work together, plan ahead, and make decisions in such a logical manner (in order to avoid disasters that affect them all), we wouldn't have things like climate change, massive medical debts, and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Those things all create a *net loss* to the economy, only benefiting a small subset of corporations and hurting all the others.\n\nAvoiding wide-scale disasters like 50% unemployment by automation requires all corporations to take a huge loss to profits, by voluntarily paying out insane sums to taxes. But if most corporations go ahead with the plan, then a few remaining corporations could cheat, evade taxes, and massively benefit from it. This is basic game theory: If everyone works together and takes a loss, then they all win in the long run. But if only a few people cheat, and exploit the cooperative loss, then the whole plan falls apart. By simple logic, everyone else has to refuse to take that voluntary loss. The inevitability of a small number of cheaters forces the entire group to cheat, effectively shooting the plan down.\n\nI would like to see this argument proven wrong.

These metal carports aren't that expensive and provide the surface area some properties may not have the space or use the house roof.  The solar panels have become a lot smaller from a few years ago, they aren't 200W for a 4x8 sheet. There are some starting to come out about 3x5 300W. It was about a $1 per watt for the panels a few months ago. That means 4 panels to get 1 kilowatt.  The market pressures are too high, the utilities can't keep obstructing more independent residential power. 20 years ago, the whole focus was on being able to net feed back to the utility to pay off the solar panel system. Now, if a residence can provide its own power for long periods of time, that cuts the electric bill enough to consider that as paying off the solar panel system. A solar panel system compared to utility rates 30 years ago took 30 years to pay off, 20 years ago, it took 20, now a pay off on a 5 kW residential system is 10 years.

With mandatory requirements of an internet-connected meter, pv array of minimum size, and battery storage of a minimum size they could then guarantee with pretty good reliability a minimum generation 24/7... maybe 1MW?

This leaves the day with the lightest residential load while the solar panels are at their maximum. That is where something like the Powerwall comes in. Even without solar panels, it could be used to store power during low rate peak hours then primarily for the evening power usage. The other thing is counties need to streamline permits for stand alone carports with solar panels on top of the roof. These metal carports aren't that expensive and provide the surface area some properties may not have the space or use the house roof.  The solar panels have become a lot smaller from a few years ago, they aren't 200W for a 4x8 sheet. There are some starting to come out about 3x5 300W. It was about a $1 per watt for the panels a few months ago. That means 4 panels to get 1 kilowatt.  The market pressures are too high, the utilities can't keep obstructing more independent residential power. 20 years ago, the whole focus was on being able to net feed back to the utility to pay off the solar panel system. Now, if a residence can provide its own power for long periods of time, that cuts the electric bill enough to consider that as paying off the solar panel system. A solar panel system compared to utility rates 30 years ago took 30 years to pay off, 20 years ago, it took 20, now a pay off on a 5 kW residential system is 10 years.

If the consequences are the literal end of humanity, and the US is the *only* holdout continuing to deny the obvious and dump pollutants into the atmosphere, that could very well trigger a third world war.\n\nThere are some signs that the Republican stance on the issue is more or less moot, though.  The biggest indicator is the insistence of the energy industry of phasing out coal power.  Coal plants across the US are shutting down and being scheduled for shutdown, all through Trump's presidency and beyond.  The reason is not scientific but economic.  Natural gas costs them less money to produce energy; solar is inching its way towards becoming cheaper than gas.  They have already more or less told Trump to fuck off on his coal power plans (DTE in Michigan has, at any rate).\n\nBeyond that, all the world's auto manufacturers, including the two major domestic manufacturers in the US, are pushing hard on electric and autonomous vehicles.

If the consequences are the literal end of humanity, and the US is the *only* holdout continuing to deny the obvious and dump pollutants into the atmosphere, that could very well trigger a third world war.\n\nThere are some signs that the Republican stance on the issue is more or less moot, though.  The biggest indicator is the insistence of the energy industry of phasing out coal power.  Coal plants across the US are shutting down and being scheduled for shutdown, all through Trump's presidency and beyond.  The reason is not scientific but economic.  Natural gas costs them less money to produce energy; solar is inching its way towards becoming cheaper than gas.  They have already more or less told Trump to fuck off on his coal power plans (DTE in Michigan has, at any rate).\n\nBeyond that, all the world's auto manufacturers, including the two major domestic manufacturers in the US, are pushing hard on electric and autonomous vehicles.  That is two major contributors to climate change being mitigated purely by the markets and industry that are affecting it.\n\nFinally, Trump and his GOP pals may be trying to kneecap climate research -- in the US, where they have the ability to do so.  The US doesn't have all the scientists in the world, hard as that is to believe.  The research will be ongoing, with or without us.\n\nTrump has the potential to cause a lot of serious, lasting harm to the US both economically and socially, but there are things that are out of his control or influence.  I think, ultimately, that climate is one of them.  Either the US industrial sector for monetary reasons and the rest of the world's governments for their own reasons will combine to make this a non-issue, or Asia and Europe will ally to force our hands economically or militarily.  I don't think that level of escalation can happen in four years.  I think, as with most other things, Trump is being an incompetent, narcissistic blowhard with this.

It's helpful to be polite and well-spoken and use your spell checker.\n\nCheap things you can do include replacing the incandescent light bulbs in your house with LEDs, which isn't so bad if you find the LEDs on sale.  They last forever and use very little energy.  Don't leave appliances and gadgets on or plugged in if you're not using/charging them.  This saves you money and uses less energy.  Turn off lights in rooms you're not in, unplug your phone or tablet when its done charging, shut down your computer every night and turn off the monitor, etc.  You can do a Google search on energy \"vampires\" that add up to a lot of energy use.\n\nYou could look into purchasing an electric car if there are still subsidies available on them, although it is debatable whether an electric car right now is a net savings in pollution compared to a gasoline car.  The energy has to come from somewhere, and right now those cars are charging from coal and gas powered plants.  At the very least, see what you can do to improve the mileage of your current car, such as checking tire air pressure, spark plugs, etc, and drive as little as you have to.

There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world\u2019s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and from phenomena such as increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes to many physical and biological systems.

We get to see police tell a man to put the gun down 10 times and when he doesn't reply we get to see them shoot them.

Who decides to let the hot girl out of her ticket? It's supposed to be a judge who makes the call.

Look back a couple of years and you can see where I am saying \"no\" to body camera's.  Look at recent posting history I say \"yes\" to body camera's.  Data shows that they are a good tool.  \n\nI will not be swayed by personal experience anecdotes of \"hot girls\"  In my experiences cops have never let me out of a ticket.  I have had plenty in my life.  When I had a crazy neighbor the cops were fair and unbiased.  \n\nIF data could be presented that showed more bad cops than good cops I would listen.  But I doubt it.  Let's take New York City for example.  There are 45,000 uniformed police officers in that city.  With literally millions of cell phones walking the streets every day.  If there were more bad cops than good cops and the bad cops did 1 \"bad\" thing every day there would be 22,500 \"bad\" things done per day.  Or just over 900 bad things per hour.  \n\nSo how many are making you tube appearances?  \n\nCops who play the \"Sometimes\" part are not cops they are criminals wearing a badge.  The unfortunate side of things is that they get away with too much.  Like my original post states.  Body cams prove a lot towards a cops innocence.  When police are called and someone is walking around with a gun in their hand and are told over 10 times to drop the gun then the police shot that person that is not murder it is not the police being judge, jury, and sometimes....it is the cops doing their jobs of protecting citizens.

The casting of the vote becomes the individual work performed by each individual that the cryptocurrency requires in order to complete the mining process. \n\nGeographical regions can subdivide into smaller regions as necessary to create greater accuracy. The evaluations from the previous month get graded to determine their accuracy based on collecting real world data.

The bonus system seeks to reward accurate evaluations.

That means it would not have a single geographic location. The UBI would therefore get distributed to people from all over the whole planet, not just a single country. Why limit it to one country? If it makes sense to distribute a UBI using a cryptocurrency approach for a single country, why not distribute it in every country? \n\nThe issue of the differences in the cost of living comes into play when determining what level of UBI to distribute. For example, [the cost of living in China runs 39.95% cheaper than in the USA.](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=China) If the UBI level gets set to a level sufficient to cover the cost of living in the USA, then do the UBI recipients in China get that exact same UBI? If so, they would collect a UBI that covers their cost of living and also puts a significant amount of extra spending currency in their wallets. \n\nFor the sake of simplicity, assume the monthly UBI gets set at a level with an exchange rate equivalent to 100 US Dollars. Of course, the actual cost of living in the USA costs much more than that, but pretend that it only costs that much to live for a month in the USA. Now, assume further that the UBI gets distributed at the same level everywhere on the planet. So, in China they get a UBI also with an exchange rate equivalent to 100 US Dollars. However, in China, they only need the equivalent of $39.95 to cover their cost of living. That means the UBI recipients would have an extra $60.05 worth of cryptocurrency to spend each month.\n\nThus, at the planetary level, a UBI needs to get equalized. Otherwise, some countries would have overblown UBI levels. Imagine what would happen in the USA if everyone received a monthly UBI set at a level more than twice as high as the monthly cost of living.\n\nThe idea of unconditionality relates only to the fact that recipients don't have to work to receive the UBI. In the system I outlined, they merely have to sign up to receive it and cast a monthly vote thumbs up or down, as to whether the amount they receive precisely covers their cost of living. Thumbs down would imply that the UBI either exceeded their cost of living or fell short. We need a UBI system that has a Goldilocks, \"just right\" coverage for the cost of living for everyone on the planet, not too much and not too little.\n", "id": "daqnhsg"}, {"comment": "As I promote UBI, Unconditional means unconditional, with no prejudice against those based on any criteria at all beyond asking for it, and being an individual.", "id": "daqnmag"}, {"comment": "So, do you think a UBI would succeed in your country, if every individual in your country who asks for it recieves a monthly UBI payment at a level three times higher than the average cost of living in your country?

When society takes good care of you, you respond in an equally caring way back to society.\n\nThe way we get criminals (which nearly all of us are, in one way or another) is by having society force people to live without the basic things that their bodies need, in order to function properly (healthfully).  We might be complex machines, but we are machines nonetheless, and if we don't take care of ourselves, we malfunction.  And for us social animals, that means we become anti-social.\n\nBasic income aims to solve the blindlingly obvious problem of the biological machines known as humans constantly trying to run a resource-abundant planet while seriously ill.", "id": "dapxtfh"}, {"comment": "> The way we get criminals (which nearly all of us are, in one way or another) is by having society force people to live without the basic things that their bodies need\n\nMost crimes, especially violent crimes, are not committed for financial reasons.

You can have tons of money and not be getting what you need, and you can have no money and be getting everything you need.  \n\nBut Unconditional Basic Income is one way to reduce the competition and violence being done to a large portion of humans who are mentally ill because they feel like society does not value them.  UBI is not a long term solution, it's a bridge between the old, competitive/anti-social system and the new, collaborative/health-based one.\n\nAgain, this has been proven over and over again, so it's not like those who have studied the science of human behavior don't know what we need to do, it's just a matter of doing it, and maybe of educating people like you who haven't studied the science, and have all sorts of confusion and myths surrounding the topic of mental health and effective systems.", "id": "daqgpbs"}, {"comment": "A cryptocurrency based UBI means it's *very* easy to con people who aren't tech-savy out of their wallet address.

Now having said that, I'm still a little bit at a loss why it wouldn't be completely obvious to you why many of us have reached the conclusion that most UBI supporters here simply must \"not get the reality\" of our current situation:\n \nDonald Trump has been elected president and there is a Republican majority in the Senate and House of representatives.\n \nIt's hard to summarize the status of our nation any better than that  last sentence. There will be no tax increases on the wealthy or on corporations in the next four years. UBI depends on tax increases. There will be no tax increases. The constant harping about UBI, **in the face of the current political climate** makes it extremely hard for many of us here to escape the conclusion that it is being pushed by people who are disconnected from reality. If they don't understand the political climate means that no meaningful change will occur in the next 4 years, then it's not a stretch for me to think they don't understand more fundamental flaws in the concept.\n \nTo use an analogy here, assume I and a decent number of my friends were fixated on banning abortion outright. Now assume that Hillary Clinton had won the election and the Democrats has taken over the House and Senate. And assume that my friends and I continuously posted and upvoted stories calling for a total ban on all abortions in America. And that we constantly commented in **entirely unrelated** discussions on posts about robots, computers, space travel that \"abortion needs to come to an end\" in a nonstop daily drone...\n \nWouldn't you be shaking your head and saying to yourself: \"wow, it's really interesting that lazychef and his friends are so totally unaware of the political situation in the country today that they think there's even the remotest possibility of this happening during the next four years\" when you read our posts? You'd initially just be surprised there are enough of us to get to the front page, but you'd start to view us as an obsessive cult tilting at windmills. You'd no longer really even be considering if we had a point about abortion in principle because you'd discount our intelligence just because you'd understand there's absolutely nothing we can accomplish until the next election cycle.\n \nUBI here is a constant daily drumbeat of tone-deaf wishful thinking.", "id": "daoxjy3"}, {"comment": ">I actually appreciate your reasoned contribution to the discussion. Now having said that, I'm still a little bit at a loss why it wouldn't be completely obvious to you why many of us have reached the conclusion that most UBI supporters here simply must \"not get the reality\" of our current situation\n\nI wasn't commenting on whether the required tax increases are realistic or not. I agree that it isn't in the very short term in the US in particular. I'm just saying that yes, it is obvious that they would be required for UBI to work.\n\nYou say that the results of the current election proves that UBI is politically unfeasible. Let me take both sides of the argument here. First the politics of the last 20 years proves that the situation is even worse. Right and left wings governments consistently refused to address corporate tax evasion. I vividly remember a G8 meeting in 2007 or 2008 that had corporate tax avoidance as its main topic, yet almost nothing was accomplished since then, even while the largest G8 country was under a supposedly left wing administration.\n\nSo in a sense the political hurdles are almost insurmountable, even worse than what could be inferred from last month's election results. I don't blame you for thinking that anyone who would take the idea seriously in the face of these challenges must be naive or missing some part of the puzzle.\n\nOn the other hand this is /r/futurology. The first step is to predict the future and **then** ask what solutions are possible (economically and politically) in those scenarios. **If** you accept that increased automation will lead to mass unemployment you have to ask what would be politically achievable in that kind of scenario, not what is achievable now.\n\nBut I think the question of whether UBI is desirable is a far more important question than whether it is feasible. In the long term most things are probably feasible given the right kind of effort.

Back then there was a genuine concern that there was going to be issues with mass starvation in the USA and other large countries.\n\nSo who do you hire to design your products if you want efficiency and shelf stability? You hire engineers and scientists, neither of which are chefs. Back then a lot of the unusual aspects of mass produced foods were marketed as positives. Wonderbread is definitely not traditional bread, and people knew that, but they used that as a way to market their product.\n\nEven going way back though almost all of these companies obviously had professional chefs or culinarians as part of their staff. The thing though is that they are there to make a benchmark. For example at a company like Campbell's they have chefs that make what they consider a gold standard for a recipe, lets say French onion soup. The chefs make a perfect soup, give it to the food scientists with the recipe and then the scientists go about how to make the soup production process friendly, shelf stable, and meet nutritional and cost guidelines. Additionally they do a shit load of focus testing. \n\nWhat's crazy is that focus testing is sometimes the hurdle and not the scientists not having tastebuds, especially with legacy brands. I was at a talk from the executive chef of Campbell's (why I used them as an example) and all of their chefs had wanted to push this new premium french onion soup recipe. All of them felt that it was really close to what you get at a nice bistro (minus the cheese) and they were really proud of it. Mainly because all of the chefs hated the tepid brown filth that was the Campbell's French onion soup. Well it went to focus group testing and all of the \"brand loyalists\" hated it. Comments on it being too thick, too salty, too onion-y, or \"how do I use this in my traditional family recipe that calls for a can of Campbell's french onion?\".\n\nAfter over a year of development and testing they just scrapped the entire thing.\n\nOnly in the last 15ish years has there been a growing trend to close that gap. Food science programs in the past were pretty much exclusively focused on the organic chemistry and biology aspects of food. Now there are more degree programs and incentives from large food producers to come from an angle of \"chefs that know science\" vs. \"scientists that make food\".\n\nI was a chef for a long time and now I work in food science now.", "id": "danvx4v"}, {"comment": "As someone who enjoys eating ass I'd advice you to stop this vile comparison at once.", "id": "danvy5z"}, {"comment": "maybe they do and they just like ass\n\nwhy judge", "id": "dansk12"}], [{"comment": "What exactly do they mean by \"structure sugar differently\"?

I don't think those words would be used if they were actually developing a chemically different sugar substitute. My best guess is that it is a combination of reduced particle size and improved dispersion throughout the product, while still maintaining the functional properties of the sugar.\n\nIt's like the difference between superfine 10x powdered sugar and normal larger grain table sugar or baking sugar. A finer particle size can lead to more surface area exposure, and more direct reception of those particles.\n\nAnother similar example I can think of that I have worked with recently is ultrasonic dispersion methods. I have seen ultrasonic sprays utilized in deli meat processing and potato chip manufacturing. For the deli meat an ultrasonic spray is used after slicing to function as an antimicrobial agent before packaging. With potato chips I have seen ultrasonic deposition used to apply a brine to a chip to season it using far less salt than normal.\n\nAgain I think this is probably a combination of both a new manufacturing method coupled with a slightly different processing of the raw ingredient.\n\nI would be really surprised if it is actually some sort of new unconventional saccharide structure.

With that said, here's my take on your question.\n\nPart of the dilemma comes from the assumption that the AGI is capable of changing itself. We can reason that it wouldn't likely change its terminal values (such as making as many paperclips as possible), but it may decide that limiters built in conflict with that goal and either disable or work around them in some way. This is particularly if the limiters are not part of the fundamental goals built into the AI.\n\nYou do have a point though, the risk primarily comes from badly chosen terminal values, and one as simple as \"make a lot of paperclips efficiently\" could probably be modified to be pretty safe. But we don't necessarily **know** that. We can't completely predict what a super intelligence might do, because if we could it wouldn't actually be more intelligent than us at all. If intelligence is the ability to find the best (most efficient, fastest, etc.) solution to problems, then a superintelligence might choose a solution that no human could ever imagine, and how do we guard against that? Even guarding against imaginable problems is tricky. Like if the goal was just \"make 10000 paperclips in as cost-effective a way as possible, only by using existing aluminum.\", maybe the AI will decide to crash the economy by manipulating the stock market so the price of aluminum goes down. That might end up achieving the goal, and it may fall short of an apocalypse, but it still wouldn't do anybody any good.\n\nThe best idea we have to prevent that is to try to create an AGI that has the capability of turning into an ASI with a goal carefully and explicitly crafted to help and protect humanity. But that kind of goal is really difficult to create, because it's so open ended and has so much potential for going wrong. And it's hindered by the fact that we don't even know of a way to create an AGI yet, but we also can't predict when it will be created, or by whom. And not all the people working on AI take the risk seriously, but if they're wrong and are careless then the whole world could suffer.

The people without the ambition or capacity are destined to be stuck working hard for medium pay all their lives so why not allow them to retire and use the stipend provided by the government to still have an amazing life, albeit with fewer luxuries.\n\nAutomation is inevitable - If companies do not automate, they risk becoming obsolete by ones that do. If companies become greedy and one decides to charge $10 for a burger and fries when it costs them $2 to make and serve, they'll be undercut by the automated food truck charging $5 for the same thing delivered right to your location and the prices will self-adjust as determined by ordinary market dynamics and government regulation.", "id": "daps774"}, {"comment": "Yes, that all makes sense in theory. However, we have had the basic income theory around since somewhere near the middle of the 19th century. Meanwhile, people keep losing their jobs at accelerating rates of change. Unemployment financial assistance levels provide such meager resources that it forces people to use debt financing, usually in the form of credit cards, as a means of economic survival between jobs. When they do, their FICO score falls which leads to the banks raising their interest rates for credit. \n\n\nSo, an honest hard working McDonald's employee who gets replaced by automation suffers the consequences of a system rigged against her. Yet, she manages to survive, by finding another job. She attends college in her off hours and goes into debt a bit more to pay for that. She then graduates and starts working at a relatively fair salary. She uses all of her spare earnings paying off her sizable debt. \n\n\nThen, after a few years of hard work, her debt has decreased, but not completely, when automation replaces her again. She cannot simply find another job, because automation replaces all jobs in the whole economy of a like nature at the same time. When those jobs go, they vanish forever. \n\n\nNow, she has reached the second level of the rigged system. She can return to school for more retraining. However, she already has a college degree. So, she decides to get a graduate degree. She can afford more debt to pay for the retraining, based on the fact that she will earn a higher salary when she finishes with a graduate degree. She works hard, gets excellent grades, and graduates to discover that she still faces a tough job market. Her FICO score suffers again and her interest rates go up again.\n\n\nAfter working at her new job with a high salary for only one year, the whole economy goes through a recession, all within a matter of months. Since she only has a year on the job, her company decides they have to cut staff and the lay-off will have to include her. They say they will give her great references though, and they do. \n\n\nHowever, due to the bad economy, she finds it even tougher than ever to find work. With her graduate degree, she manages to teach a few classes as an adjunct at a local community college. That pays about the same as collecting unemployment though. So, her FICO score suffers again, and her interest rates go up again. \n\n\nThis long, unlucky story, shows how the banks benefit by keeping the economy rigged against hard working people. They want average people to fail, because it provides a justification for raising the interest rates on any and all debt financing. So, they  create incentives for predatory lending, designed to put people into debts they cannot repay. They like it when people like our victim of the system have low FICO scores, because they can then charge her 33% for a credit card. Compare that profit margin to what they can get making risky investments. If her FICO score gets too bad and she can no longer get a credit card, then she can pay over 300% for a payday loan. Then, she faces the consequences for that, a seemingly endless cycle of borrowing again and again, mostly to pay for the previous payday loan.\n\n\nWhy would the 1% ever surrender such a profitable cash cow? They will fight against a universal basic income with everything in their arsenal. If it ever does pass as legislation, they will make sure that it has such low levels that people will still require debt financing to survive. Their business model depends on perpetuating that brutal system.\n\n\nIt works much like the slavery system did. The debt collectors play a role similar to those who made a living chasing runaway slaves. Read the book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, and you will see how treating people as financial properties formed the basis for that system and forced slave owners to sell the children of their slaves to pay off their debts. The slave owners might otherwise treat their slaves well, but they would have no choice when they faced financial ruin otherwise. Debt financing and the profits it generates can turn human beings into crude and brutal monsters.\n\n", "id": "dapwfwn"}], [{"comment": "Hilarious.... as if they did RnD solely in the last year when the fight for $15 was getting pushed.

That apple is far more valuable by all economic measures, until it's possibility of existence is traded on the open market and the company who owns the means of production is evaluated higher than the day before. And the possibility of the global apple stock is seen to be dropping so the global price for apples starts to rise. And so the investors who build factories that sort and distribute the apples see that while apple value is growing, they can put more money into making a few new factories. Then the expectation of higher output from that investment conflates factors further by shifting the global market again. \n\nMeanwhile the production and investment in the oil that is pushing that apple and it's packaging back and forth around the world is being determined in the same way, based on metaphors and preceived growth or stagnation. And the government policy dictating price caps and taxes on fuel are influenced by perceived vote gain or loss based on racial makeup, and income levels of districts that are currently represented by the policy makers. \n\nAnd then the companies that ship the apples are traded the same, will their minimum wage go up? Better increase the price of shipping so that the exec's can keep their bonuses. Oh, they can automate? Might as well undercut the competition and drop prices further.

In another paper, Olds looked at the creation of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which offers publicly funded health insurance for kids whose families don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid. By comparing the rate of entrepreneurship of those who just barely qualified for CHIP to those whose incomes just barely exceeded the cutoff, he was able to estimate the program\u2019s impact on new business creation. The rate of incorporated business ownership for those eligible households just below the cutoff was 31 percent greater than for similarly situated families that could not rely on CHIP to care for their children if they needed it.\n\nand also in this same article\n\n> A 2010 study by RAND found a similar effect with Medicare. American men were more likely to start a business just after turning 65 and qualifying for Medicare than just before.\n\n> When France lowered the barriers to receiving unemployment insurance, it actually increased the rate of entrepreneurship.. Until 2001, citizens on unemployment insurance had little incentive to start businesses, since doing so would terminate their benefits. Instead of gutting the program, the state simply decided to let anyone who founded a business keep drawing benefits for a limited period, and guaranteed that they would be eligible again if that business failed. The result: a 25 percent increase in the rate of new-firm creation. \n\nAlso, here's what [a recent European study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150331074345.htm) found:\n\n> Generous welfare benefit levels make people who are not in employment more likely to want to work rather than less, new research suggests. \"Many scholars and commentators fear that generous social benefits threaten the sustainability of the welfare state due to work norm erosion, disincentives to work and dependency cultures,\" the researchers say. \"This article concludes that there are few signs that groups with traditionally weaker bonds to the labor market are less motivated to work if they live in generous and activating welfare states.\"", "id": "dao5zk8"}, {"comment": "Welfare is only issued in certain situations.

And then they got onto the question of automation and the problems of unemployment that it was making and the difficulties of transferring workers from this to that when they were only trained for this. Finally I said, \"The trouble with you gentlemen is you still think money is real.\u201d And they looked at me and sort of said, \"Oh ha ha ha, someone who doesn't think money is real. Cause everybody knows money is money and it's very important.\" But it just isn't real at all because it has the same relationship to real wealth, that is to say to actual goods and services, that words have to meaning - that words have to the physical world. And as words are not the physical world, money is not wealth. It only is an accounting of available energy - economic energy.*\n\n*Now what happens then when you introduce technology into production? You produce enormous quantities of goods by technological methods but at the same time you put people out of work. You can say, \"Oh but it always creates more jobs. There will always be more jobs.\" Yes, but lots of them will be futile jobs. They will be jobs making every kind of frippery and unnecessary contraption, and one will also at the same time have to beguile the public into feeling that they need and want these completely unnecessary things that aren't even beautiful. And therefore an enormous amount of nonsense employment and busy work, bureaucratic and otherwise, has to be created in order to keep people working, because we believe as good Protestants that the devil finds work for idle hands to do. But the basic principle of the whole thing has been completely overlooked, that the purpose of the machine is to make drudgery unnecessary. And if we don't allow it to achieve its purpose we live in a constant state of self-frustration.*\n\n*So then if a given manufacturer automates his plant and dismisses his labor force and they have to operate on a very much diminished income, (say some sort of dole), the manufacturer suddenly finds that the public does not have the wherewithal to buy his products. And therefore he has invested in this expensive automative machinery to no purpose. And therefore obviously the public has to be provided with the means of purchasing what the machines produce.*\n\n*People say, \"That's not fair. Where's the money going to come from? Who's gonna pay for it?\" The answer is the machine. The machine pays for it, because the machine works for the manufacturer and for the community. This is not saying you see that a...this is not the statist or communist idea that you expropriate the manufacture and say you can't own and run this factory anymore, it is owned by the government. It is only saying that the government or the people have to be responsible for issuing to themselves sufficient credit to circulate the goods they are producing and have to balance the measuring standard of money with the gross national product. That means that taxation is obsolete - completely obsolete. It ought to go the other way.*\n\n*Theobald points out that every individual should be assured of a minimum income. Now you see that absolutely horrifies most people. \u201cSay all these wastrels, these people who are out of a job because they're really lazy see... ah giving them money?\u201d Yeah, because otherwise the machines can't work. They come to a blockage.*\n\n*This was the situation of the Great Depression when here we were still, in a material sense, a very rich country, with plenty of fields and farms and mines and factories...everything going. But suddenly because of a psychological hang-up, because of a mysterious mumbo-jumbo about the economy, about the banking, we were all miserable and poor - starving in the midst of plenty. Just because of a psychological hang-up. And that hang-up is that money is real, and that people ought to suffer in order to get it. But the whole point of the machine is to relieve you of that suffering. It is ingenuity. You see we are psychologically back in the 17th century and technically in the 20th.

People know what's best for them, not governments, so just give people cash, and let them use it in markets. Basic income also allows for the removal of market distortionary policies like welfare, subsidies, and minimum wage laws.\n\nHere's another good read along these lines as well, explaining [the Hayekian price system](http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/2016/04/22/the-unconditional-basic-income-and-the-hayekian-price-system/).", "id": "dao5ev8"}, {"comment": "> Basic income is the government deciding to hand out cash,\n\nGovernment itself has no wealth.

It has a 12.3 gallon tank (rounding down, it's actually closer to 12.4). It can do 34 mpg combined, 40 highway but for this example, I'll use the combined to give an extra advantage to the Tesla Model S. This means it can do 418.2 miles to a tank. Gas pumps in the US can dispense up to 10 gallons per minute, or you can fill the tank in 1 minute 14 seconds. Say 5 minutes in total to include the time it takes to pay for it assuming you don't pay at the pump. For the entire journey from New York to LA according to Google Maps, you would have to stop for gas 7 times (rounding up, you can't stop 6.6 times).\n\nNot only that, but Google Maps says that journey will take roughly 40 hours. This will be if you go the speed limit, so 40 hours + the time to refuel. Or, 18 hours quicker than that Tesla or almost a day, and I highly doubt they stuck to the speed limit.\n\nNow onto pricing. The Tesla Model S P85D starts at $84,900. The Civic, $19,700. I do know the Tesla Model 3 is much cheaper than the Model S, but it's still $10K more than the Civic. Sure, over time it will be cheaper to buy the Model 3 and even the Model S, but with the Model 3, you will still have the range issue.\n\nIf you only use your car to drive from a house in the suburbs into a city, then an electric car is fine, I'd actually encourage it as long as it's not one of those shitty Gee Whiz type cars.

A supply chain is basically all the products that go into making that final product. In the case of a head of lettuce, say, we can take an overview to see how the cost might be effected:\n\nThe end location, the supermarket, is where you need to get that head of lettuce. To do that you need to transport the lettuce from the processing plant to the store. That takes a vehicle, and since the processing plant might be 200 miles from the store it delivers to, you might need a specialized truck with a larger battery to transport it. Now, at the processing plant, they need bags to package the lettuce, the raw heads of lettuce, and blades and other supplies for processing. All of those also need to be transported, some of them over many miles, and the list goes on.\n\nThe supply chain is the reason new products run out of stock or need huge profit margins initially. When you're just starting to make something, you are asking many companies if you can buy more of their stuff, which means they have to ask their suppliers to buy more of their stuff, and so on. When there's so many people asking other people to do things, inevitably, the ball is dropped somewhere. Tesla cars are remarkable because in a short amount of time they have been able to get a supply chain for an entire vehicle together (thousands and thousands of individual parts). However, they still have tons of problems ramping up production and delivering vehicles on time because supply chain issues.\n\nOver time, your suppliers get used to you asking for product, and you're in the regular rotation of things. This can take from months to years to sort out well, but once you do, you have something called an *established supply chain*. Knowing you can rely on your suppliers and having a full set of backups just in case lets you know how much it will cost to make your product, which in turn lets you drop the cost of your product to be more competitive. All in all, it's a hidden part of product development that is as important to production as the research/design work needed to make said product.\n\nFull circle. To ask so many suppliers and logistics companies to switch their fleets from diesel vehicles to electric over the course of 10 years, you run into problems in the various supply chains. Not only do people making lettuce have to get used to the new vehicles and spend lots of money to buy them, but the electric vehicle companies also have to sort out their supply chains to make more vehicles. It becomes a mess very quickly, balls are dropping the the DOW in 2008, and to cover the cost of everything, the price of a head of lettuce quadruples...

You lend money to the bank in the form of deposits, which they invest to generate a return which they distribute out to shareholders and to pay the interest they owe to their bondholders/depositors (people like you).\n\nInvestment returns are fundamentally based on risk/volatility. Your savings account has extremely low interest rates for many reasons, but the most important is that they are essentially risk free (for you, because of FDIC), and they are demand accounts, meaning you can come, at any time, and demand they pay you back your money. You could give the bank $10 billion dollars, but come back the next day and want it back. The bank cannot afford to take a whole lot of risk with this money, because they have no idea how long they will have it for.\n\nThe interest on your savings account is tightly related to Fed. Reserve rates. If the Fed. Reserve raises interest rates, your savings account's interest will rise as well (think of Fed. Reserve rates as a \"baseline\" rate that most other rates are compared to. If Fed. Interest rates rise, most other interest rates will rise, too). At the moment, rates are extremely low to encourage lending (and thus, stimulate the economy).\n\n HOWEVER, raising interest rates is not a \"free lunch\". Many people will cite the massive savings account interest rates in the 80s, but they do not take into account the massive inflation at the time. Even though they were getting nominal \"10%\" interest, inflation was so high, the \"real\" returns were very low. \n\nIn addition, high savings account interest rates are as bad for us as they are for the banks. In the late 70s-80s, banks were competing with each other to offer the highest rates on their savings accounts (as Regulation Q had recently been removed, which capped the maximum interest rates banks could offer on their savings accounts).\n\nThe problem with this, is that many of these banks investments (at the time) were in fixed rate mortgages. When interest rates rise, their liabilities to depositors (like you) goes up, because suddenly they owe /u/getMeSomeDunkin 20% interest on his money, instead of just 10%. In addition, the dollar value on the account has not changed. Your $2000 is still $2000 regardless of what happens with interest rates. Their liabilities increase, but their fixed rate mortgages are stuck at the same rate were made out at. Because nobody wants to buy fixed-rate mortgages at rates lower than current lending rates, their market value plummets.\n\nTheir assets have lost value, while their liabilities have actually increased. If this continues, banks become insolvent, meaning that even if they were to liquidate all of their assets, they wouldn't have the money to pay you off when you come knocking for your money!\n\nNeedless to say, when all banks are doing this, this becomes a big problem.\n\nSavings accounts have always, and will always give you extremely low \"real\" returns, because they are riskless demand accounts. If you want a return, you have to expose yourself to risk (market volatility)!\n\n**EDIT: This is all a high-level, simplified view. Many forests would have to be cut down to print the thousands of volumes it would take to describe all of all the moving parts in perfect detail.**\n\nPS: I am a big advocate for improving Financial education in schools. Finance is everpresent in the modern world, and it will be as long as we have currency. The fact that we graduate HS students (and even College students) without ever teaching them how mortgage/auto loans work, what stocks are, or what an interest rate means is deplorable.\n\nFinance/Econ is interesting and fun, if you are starting college soon, please consider them!

The addition of 43 new major rules last year increased annual regulatory costs by more than $22 billion, bringing the total annual costs of Obama Administration rules to an astonishing $100 billon-plus in just seven years.\n\n>The effects of this rampant rulemaking are widespread. Among them: **higher energy rates from the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d; increased food prices for both people and pets as a result of excessively prescriptive food production standards; restricted access to credit for consumers and small businesses under Dodd\u2013Frank financial regulations**; fewer health care choices and higher medical costs because of the Affordable Care Act; **and reduced Internet investment and innovation under the network neutrality rules dictated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)**. \n\nThe bolded examples are all regulations that are very necessary, either to protect the environment, public health, or protect consumers **against monopolies**.\n\nThis comes from The Heritage Foundation, that describes itself as \n\n>The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institution\u2014a think tank\u2014whose mission is to formulate and **promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom**, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.\n\nThey even use the same language as the video when they say net neutrality reduces innovation.

This isn't a sub limited to technological discussion--it's a sub speculating about the future, period. Climate change will have an enormous impact on the future of civilizations. I'll grant you that the millennials banking article is itself shitty, but the theme is spot on--the article talks about what that means for the future of banking, and a big shift in finance would have enormous societal implications, perhaps moreso than a \"fusion breakthrough\" that may ultimately go nowhere. Likewise, climate change is influencing our world a hell of a lot more than carbon nanotubes ever will.\n\nAgain, this isn't just about technological breakthroughs, this is about current trends that could shape the future.

But you want to know what else I'd like to talk about? *How fusion would affect our daily lives, as well as our overarching system.* The current electrical grid can't handle limitless, nearly free energy. \n\nCarbon nanotubes are almost as magical as graphene. *What would a world that utilizes nanotubes look like?* Especially considering that nanotubes will greatly aid in energy efficiency\u2014 how would nuclear fusion power affect a society that widely utilizes carbon nanotubes? Certainly sociopolitics would be different, wouldn't it?\n\nSimply stopping at the tech wank would be to commit the same sin of cheap science fiction\u2014 it assumes the world of tomorrow is just the world of today with better gadgets.\n\nThe problem /r/Futurology has is that it keeps regurgitating many of the same topics. Maybe I'm biased because I'm all for /r/Vyrdism, but I've definitely noticed that Basic Income is a given on the sub and it's heresy to say anything against it (and, by extension, the State that's supposed to hand it out).

Pop-futurist blogs have to summarize these issues into just a few paragraphs, and most of the blogs are written by commission\u2014 Write an article, get paid $50, and whatnot.

This isn't a sub limited to technological discussion--it's a sub speculating about the future, period. Climate change will have an enormous impact on the future of civilizations. I'll grant you that the millennials banking article is itself shitty, but the theme is spot on--the article talks about what that means for the future of banking, and a big shift in finance would have enormous societal implications, perhaps moreso than a \"fusion breakthrough\" that may ultimately go nowhere. Likewise, climate change is influencing our world a hell of a lot more than carbon nanotubes ever will.\n\nAgain, this isn't just about technological breakthroughs, this is about current trends that could shape the future. I can only understand your complaint in the context of you fundamentally misunderstanding the purpose of this sub.", "id": "danpli7"}], [{"comment": "The fallacy committed is believing that \"futurology\" = \"tech wank.\" \n\nWhile there's definitely a lot of that, another huge part of it is \"the human response to tech wank.\" \n\nFor example\u2014 fusion sounds amazing, and funding for fusion has gone up in private circles. But you want to know what else I'd like to talk about? *How fusion would affect our daily lives, as well as our overarching system.* The current electrical grid can't handle limitless, nearly free energy. \n\nCarbon nanotubes are almost as magical as graphene. *What would a world that utilizes nanotubes look like?* Especially considering that nanotubes will greatly aid in energy efficiency\u2014 how would nuclear fusion power affect a society that widely utilizes carbon nanotubes? Certainly sociopolitics would be different, wouldn't it?\n\nSimply stopping at the tech wank would be to commit the same sin of cheap science fiction\u2014 it assumes the world of tomorrow is just the world of today with better gadgets.\n\nThe problem /r/Futurology has is that it keeps regurgitating many of the same topics. Maybe I'm biased because I'm all for /r/Vyrdism, but I've definitely noticed that Basic Income is a given on the sub and it's heresy to say anything against it (and, by extension, the State that's supposed to hand it out). Of course, I can tolerate that to an extent. Discussing when nations are considering basic income? I can tolerate that as well. But when every other damn article on the sub is about basic income and how \"It's Definitely Time To Consider Basic Income\" or \"Why We Need Basic Income\" or \"The Future Is Basic Income\" or whatnot\u2014 usually repeating the same things the last 10 articles stated without adding anything new\u2014 you can see how it can get grating.\n\nThis is partially because pop-sci blogs are the lifeblood of the subreddit. I say 'pop-sci', but to remove confusion with PopSci, I'll just use the term 'pop-futurist'. Pop-futurist blogs have to summarize these issues into just a few paragraphs, and most of the blogs are written by commission\u2014 Write an article, get paid $50, and whatnot.

That'll likely go up enough so transmission doesn't exceed what the grid can handle.

That argument about the Beach is a common straw man argument while the rest of your arguments are valid. \n\nStorage and Variable Solar Input Availability are concerns they are merely technical problems and not insurmountable even with current technology. \n\nThe largest issue is the Amount of Panel you need for the amount of Electrical power it produces. If you can Shrink the Area the panel needs to power a house while keeping the power produced the same then you can fit more panels on the roof. IF you could make it so that one panel is Say 3 feet by 3 Feet and can produce all the power a typical Household uses in a day. In theory if you placed two or more of them on the home they you could produce the power needs for both the day and night/cloudy days long as you can store that energy. \n\nSo the challenge for solar is not working at night but maximizing power output to surface area covered during the sunny days and storage of that power so it can be used when needed. \n\nYou also missed that Solar has one other glaring problem that normal utilities don't. Most Solar installation for the home needs to be connected to the Standard electrical Grid by law. This puts a strain on the Electrical Grid during peek times of the day by adding extra load. This can burn out Transformers and Fuses along standard electrical lines faster then normal. \n\nThere is an answer to this problem and that is to make the electrical grid smarter which requires computer controls which in and of itself has a list of problems regarding security(Smart Grids could potentially be hack-able).

The solar panel structure must penetrate the roof barriers; waterproofing and AV barriers to connect with the primary building structure.

Considering that agricultural society started around 10,000 years ago, that's tomorrow...relatively speaking.  And its a species-altering event.   \n\nMy problem is not at all with solar, its with the thread that advocates cancelling fusion research to further solar.  That's nuts.  Solar is great and practical too.  But its not even a drop in the ocean compared to fusion's potential.  Want to put resources from oil and gas into solar?  Great.  Coal?  Awesome.  Wind?  Ok.

Solar is becoming cheaper and more abundant as time goes by.\n\nEven more important, solar is scalable. You can make a small rural solar installation, or a really big one for large cities.

Actually amniotic stem cells are very under rated. If you have the opportunity to donate your placenta, do it! You can also request the placenta be stored in a cryochamber for future technology in case your child needs a new organ.

We create multiple wounds per animal to minimize the number of animals needed. \n\nAfter months of paperwork, we get approval that our experiment is humane and does not cause excess stress or pain on the animal. \n\nThe procedure is identical to surgery on a human. The pig is given a mild sedative to relax it, it's brought into a research OR room where everything is as sterile as a human OR. A vet puts the animal under complete anesthesia. Wounds are created with a scalpel and given the appropriate treatment (3D printing vs skin control vs standard skin graft vs nothing). We didn't do burns, but the procedure is identical (also 3rd degree burns are not as painful as 2nd degree because the nerves are dead, same with removing skin). \n\nThey are bandaged up appropriately and the vets wake them up. I think the pigs were given oral pain killers but it might be a patch, I don't remember. Either way the pigs do not feel pain and are closely monitored. If the animal shows any sign of pain, they are quickly given more meds. \n\nAnyone involved with the animals down to the janitors mopping the floors can report potential animal cruelty to any of several different levels of reviewers. Everyone's ass is on the line, so if for only that reason, everyone is really careful to not cause suffering to the animals. \n\nAny research involving animals goes through this process.
