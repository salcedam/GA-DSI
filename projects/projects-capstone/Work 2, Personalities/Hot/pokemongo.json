Excited me decided to leave early for lunch and see if I could catch it.\n\nIt was at a stop near my job that is a park that I don't visit much anymore as my best catch there has been 1 Magikarp.  It's also across train tracks so I have to drive there as a straight walk to this park is not possible without putting myself at risk.\n\nSo giddy me takes a careful drive over to the park.  I was happy to see the Omanyte show up just as I stepped out of my car.  It was fairly close to the stop and the new tracker got me to go revisit a spot I thought was no longer useful.  It has been at least 3 weeks since I caught a new Pokemon in the wild so this was refreshing.  So on one hand this new tracker can be useful in letting players know what's nearby at stops they don't frequent.\n\nOn the other hand; the 2 new Pokemon I have caught in the wild prior to Omanyte (Lapras & Wheezing) were caught due to the Sightings in my neighborhood.  Had the Nearby system been implemented at that time I would have missed both of those completely.  I keep the app open almost all day incase of rare spawns (often times while phone is plugged in) and have never seen Lapras or Wheezing shadows in my neighborhood or by my job or anywhere else in my travels.

But with a 1300x1300ft region to search now, the tracker may as well be useless. \n\n1300ft is a serious distance to walk. Google calculates it would take around 9 minutes to walk it. Now consider that you would have to repeat that 10 times to criss cross the 1300x1300 region. \n\nFuthermore, consider that even criss crossing the region 10 times to cover all the streets running in the east west direction may be insufficient because the spawn circle isn't large enough to cover half a block to either side. So in reality, you have to cover the entire region twice, going first east west, and then north south.\n\nThat's THREE HOURS of walking to locate that \"nearby\" pokemon, and by the time you finish walking it will have long since despawned!\n\nThe only way this makes sense at all is if there are some people who have no pokemon at all spawn nearby and they need that extended radius to detect something, anything... But it's still useless because if the pokemon is that far away they will NEVER find it in time without some kind of compass indicating the general direction of the thing.\n\nAnd if their problem is no pokemon spawning within 50M, well, the developers should just fix that, because it's stupid to limit spawns to only highly trafficked areas.

All you had to do was throw a ball and you'd get the pokemon. That'd be boring as hell. Even if the values just decreased, that'd still just make the game easier and weaker.

Fortunately it seems to be progressively improving. They just released the update that increased sightings to 200m, and a new platform for adding pokestops might be coming soon as it was released in ingress.\n\n>terrible trackers\n\nHave you used the tracker much? It works wonderfully. Sure, you need pokestops around you to use it, but when you have those it's super helpful. They found a nice balance between easy and hard that also doesn't cause legal/safety issues and keeps people engaged with pokestops.\n\n>constantly having insufficient balls\n\nI mean this too is just the design of the game.

There are also many comments in the tool itself.\n\nJust a few words  about moveset rankings.\nThese rankings come from 2 data sources : [gameinfo](https://pokemon.gameinfo.io/fr) & /u/Professor_Kukui (who you may know for his intense [work](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/4vcobt/posthotfix_pokemon_go_full_moveset_rankings/) on Pok\u00e9mon Go datas and posts on TSR).\n\nYou can chose the data set and your language (fr/eng). It will change all the rankings. You can also unhide all the columns to compare rankings. \n\n- The 1st point was to rank all 842 pok\u00e9mon and make choice according to the rank of the moveset you'll get. You know it, The difference is huge between movesets but it's really hard to find a \"simple\" way to compare them. I gave an example with arcanine (in the sheet), but you can take any Pok\u00e9mon and compare the movesets ... it's crystal clear. \nThis helps to stop focusing on IV and focus on the moveset instead.\n\n- Then, my second point was to get a better understanding of IV impact. What would be the real difference between what is called a \"bad\" pok\u00e9mon and a \"perfect\" one ? Should I focus on the global percentage or the IV stats themselves ?\nThis manager gives the answer. You can really compare and make choices accordingly. \nYou will also have the possibility to consider the stat itself according to the profile your pok\u00e9mon have (attacker or defender)\nLet's say you \"may\" have the 25th best attacker (after evolving) and you have a decent IV (80%) BUT quite low attack IV, you can really reconsider your choice to even evolve it ! That's why I wait for a max defense IV Rhyhorn whereas I already have a max attack one ... Cause I know he's a defender type thanks to rankings. \n\n- And, my third point was to have ALL the useful information in a single line. I hate to scroll and collect data from here and there, and still don't get why such a tool hasn't been made yet... here, you know everything you have to know about your pok\u00e9mon.

These are the one you have to be \"picky\" on. Super IV, best or second best moveset defensively or offensively, super ranking among the 842 possibilities.\n- ALL the other pok\u00e9mon are good to keep if you hit a good moveset.

I have repeatedly said that given the progression of the game experience by the players, I don't think the community as a whole (forgive me rural people) will ever see buying pokeballs as a value proposition. It is my firm belief that the only way Niantic will see the revenue numbers they would like to see from Pokeballs would be to sell an infinite unlock for Pokeballs - it could be a one time fee like bag/storage or they could charge monthly perhaps. However, the problem with being stingy with Pokeballs is that Pokeballs are the main in-game currency for staying engaged with the app. Taxing Pokeballs heavily will cause disengagement by all players. Disengagement equals less selling opportunities all over the board - from in-game purchases to why would a sponsor need to sponsor a game with a dwindling player base?\n\nThe more I analyze the business case the more I see that Niantic is between a rock and a hard place on revenue distribution. I'm not saying they haven't made a monumental pile of cash or that they aren't currently making any money. I'm saying from a business perspective, they want to earn as much revenue as the market can bear. How do you do that as a developer? Make a game people want to play and continue to stay engaged with over time. Dangle little QoL purchases that makes the consumer feel like it has enhanced the game play.

Some people have always had 2-3 items per poke stop.  It was only recently that the curveball bonus was unrolled to some people in the latest update.  Some people take twice as many balls to catch even simple pokemon (for those of you who think this is skill based, you're fooling yourself - start several accounts and compare how each behaves).    \n\nNiantic are clearly doing multivariate testing on the game so it's difficult for anyone's experience to compare to another persons experience.  One hypothesis which has been discussed is whether or not Niantic are penalising players for spending money.  Now this is a new trend in tech companies, if you spend money on facebook advertising your facebook page - facebook will then penalise you when you don't spend money (i.e. your posts won't reach your full follower base the way it did pre-spending money) - the logic being - \"this person is willing to spend money, lets milk them for all we can.\"  It's highly probable that Niantic with their google heritage may be trying something similar - far from rewarding those that have spent money - Niantic would more likely penalise them and make the game harder for them unless they spend more money - same logic applies, \"this person is willing to spend money - what can we do to get as much money out of them as possible?  Let's penalise them until they spend more money - then reward them with temporary normal gameplay when they do\".  It's classic addiction mimicking the effects of physical addictions. It's highly probable that they are implementing an algorithm like this given it seems to be a trend amongst tech companies - so my best advice is... no matter how bad your game, don't spend money.  \n\n**EDIT: TLDR; Don't spend money**"], [7, "At least you have the new tracker which will show you where the closest pokestop is...

However, the problem with being stingy with Pokeballs is that Pokeballs are the main in-game currency for staying engaged with the app. Taxing Pokeballs heavily will cause disengagement by all players. Disengagement equals less selling opportunities all over the board - from in-game purchases to why would a sponsor need to sponsor a game with a dwindling player base?\n\nThe more I analyze the business case the more I see that Niantic is between a rock and a hard place on revenue distribution. I'm not saying they haven't made a monumental pile of cash or that they aren't currently making any money. I'm saying from a business perspective, they want to earn as much revenue as the market can bear. How do you do that as a developer? Make a game people want to play and continue to stay engaged with over time. Dangle little QoL purchases that makes the consumer feel like it has enhanced the game play. Most of us (sorry rural again) are used to having enough pokeballs to play the game - flipping this switch is going to be close to impossible.", "id": "dap7sld"}, {"comment": "Such as new uniforms for a buck or little ties and bows for the Pok\u00e9mon. 10 pack with various colors for a couple bucks.

One hypothesis which has been discussed is whether or not Niantic are penalising players for spending money.  Now this is a new trend in tech companies, if you spend money on facebook advertising your facebook page - facebook will then penalise you when you don't spend money (i.e. your posts won't reach your full follower base the way it did pre-spending money) - the logic being - \"this person is willing to spend money, lets milk them for all we can.\"  It's highly probable that Niantic with their google heritage may be trying something similar - far from rewarding those that have spent money - Niantic would more likely penalise them and make the game harder for them unless they spend more money - same logic applies, \"this person is willing to spend money - what can we do to get as much money out of them as possible?  Let's penalise them until they spend more money - then reward them with temporary normal gameplay when they do\".  It's classic addiction mimicking the effects of physical addictions.

And only a select Pokemon are ever going to be the best. Snorlax, Dragonite, Vaporeon and a few others are the best Pokemon to use but what about Butterfree? A Pokemon I love? I can't use it because it sucks. No amount of training will change that. But in the main games I have one with a more tactical edge, something I could actually make use of. Pokemon Go rewards farming Pokemon, it rewards sheer power, it rewards the depersonalisation of Pokemon and I think that is rooted in the way you catch Pokemon and the battle system.

It was a paid concert area earlier in the day but this was no-one-fucking-o'clock 6-7 hours after it finished so I went over the balls-high metal screening fence and jogged around looking for a Dratini that spawned in there.

Anyways, these two people where sitting on a public bench in front of the* **COURTHOUSE** *and talking to one another about Pok\u00e9mon GO, then, out of nowhere this man (A Charlie Manson looking ass hole) starts yelling from his apartment window across the street, telling my friends* **\"You better move on\"** *and* **\"I am telling you to leave now!\"**. *Obviously my friends knew they where doing nothing wrong so they stayed on the public bench and continued to play Pok\u00e9mon. After a few minutes the man came out of his upstairs apartment and stormed across the street and repeated some of the things he was yelling earlier, thing like \"I am telling you to move on\" and \"You need to leave now!\". My friend (the guy sitting down) refused to leave because they where on public property. After he refused to leave the man then pulled a lead pipe out of his waistline and said \"I am only going to say it one more time, move on now...\". Obviously my two friends proceeded to leave and walk right in to the court house and report him, he was fined 200$ and given a court date and a parole of sorts where if he verbally abused anyone in range of the courthouse again before his court date, he would be sent to jail for an un-disclosed amount of time. This guy, like many people, is just severely screwed up in the head, like an animal that has been severely abused.

I think it was more menacing because I couldn't see them in the dark, only tell there were multiple people and they were trailer trashy. Later on they yelled at me from their car as they drove home and it wasn't a big deal as I could see them, just looked like a group of mostly drunk women being more happy drunk then angry drunk.\n\nAnother time when asked what I was doing out riding at midnight by two women with a baby I said \"oh you don't want to know it's a bit embarrasing\" before saying pokemon. The other woman I wasn't talking to started going on about how I should go get laid instead of playing games and to get a life. I ignored it and said \"My kids and wife are at home, you're braver than I am taking a baby out for a midnight walk in the dark\". It wasn't clever or a dig really.. But was enough to shut her up. Let her know I was further along in \"having a life\" than she was and make her feel judged for being out in the near wilderness at that time. Not that I think there is anything wrong with it, but just to give her a taste of her own medicine.\n\nOh almost forgot, got ushered out of a cordoned off concert area on public grounds at 4am by a security guard. It was a paid concert area earlier in the day but this was no-one-fucking-o'clock 6-7 hours after it finished so I went over the balls-high metal screening fence and jogged around looking for a Dratini that spawned in there. Security guard who I wouldn't have even guessed was there for a public park area confronted me. Can't complain about that though, that was actually suspicious activity and he had every right to usher me out. I simply had no idea anyone would give AF. I guess there might have been equipment in there I couldn't see.\n\nShould add, i'm sorry you had to deal with your situation. I wouldn't have put up with it personally.

It's also fascinating that you assume that the pokemon around you that you're now missing out on are rare yet the pokestops a ways away are just going to be filled with weedles, despite the fact that the sightings menu only sampled from one spawn area whereas the pokestop tracker samples from up to nine different spawn areas.\n\n>until you realise that there are passengers in a car too.\n\nGod forbid you have to walk in a walking game?

Its like Niantic wants people to drive in this situation to get there before the Pok\u00e9mon despawns. But they heavily discourage driving. \n\nThere's plenty of examples of why this is a poorly thought out solution.

You power up your pokemon through Stardust. You get it the following ways:\n\n100 per capture, 500 per gym occupied, hatching eggs, first-day catches and 7-day streaks, etc.\n\nThere's no real focus to the game other than to catch them all, level up, battle at gyms, and have fun.", "id": "darasg9"}], [{"comment": "The point of a gym is to try to get one of your Pok\u00e9mon into it, buy either \"training it up,\" or eliminating all of the opposing teams Pok\u00e9mon from it. Then, once your Pok\u00e9mon is in the gym, you can collect 1000 star dust and 10 coins FOR EACH GYM you have Pok\u00e9mon in.  \nSo, let's say for example, you only can access two gyms in your area, for whatever reason. Let's say one is red team and one is blue team. The red team gym is level 3. You can take your Pok\u00e9mon into that gym and fight it over an over again, and every time you do, the gym gets more points (I'm assuming your red team due to flair), once the gym has enough prestige from you \"training it\" (i.e. attacking it over and over again), you can put one of your Pok\u00e9mon in it. Now, let's say you walk over and attack the blue gym, and let's say it's level 3 as well, with two Pok\u00e9mon in it, both CP 2000. Every time you fight and defeat those Pok\u00e9mon, the gym loses prestige, and once it has 0 prestige, you can then take over the gym and place one of your Pok\u00e9mon in it. In this scenario, if you were able to do all that and not be knocked out of either gym, you could then tap on Shop in game and tap on the little shield up top that would read \"2\" (again, in this scenario), at which point, you would get 2000 star dust and 20 Coins (in game currency). I think it's that much. I haven't taken the time to do any gyms as it is pointless for me to try to do more than one in my area and at my level. So, if I am wrong, I apologize, but I know if you have one gym at least, it is worth 1000 stardust and 10 coins (at least as of last week).  \nIf you are lucky and no one knocks you out of the gyms your Pok\u00e9mon are in, you can collect your Shop reward every 20 hours.  \nOh, and you go get a meager amount of XP for training a gym or attacking it, but not all that much.  \n\nEDIT: It looks like it is 500 stardust. sorry.", "id": "daranl4"}, {"comment": "Also, you can collect shop rewards every 21 hours, not 20.", "id": "darfoio"}], [{"comment": "sweet, sweet coins and dust.", "id": "daraaqb"}, {"comment": "Ok.\n\nBut I have no coins and no dust.\n\nJust a lot of lost time and potions.\n\nWhere do the coins and dust come from?", "id": "daraeje"}, {"comment": "Collect coins at shop", "id": "darajfc"}, {"comment": "they come from the shop, if you have your pokemon in the gym, either by flipping a rival teams gym or leveling your ownbteams and placing a pokemon inside", "id": "darakaw"}], [{"comment": "You get exp for battling, you may have missed that on finished battle screen, unless you didn't defeat any pokemon.\n\nIf you are at an enemy gym you are trying to defeat pokemon to be able to turn it to your teams gym.

It just felt so easy and I'm not a big gamer. My prestiging count is almost the same as my battle count. \n\nIt was also refreshing to see all lower level trainers in gyms from all teams. Based on that, it looked like niantic increased the player base. Meaning, lots of different players in 20 gyms around me, instead of roughly the same 10 players in the 20 gyms around me. Maybe it's because I see no glory in holding the most gyms. It seems pointless.\n\nThe GSP spoofers around me ended up playing less too, which made the game more enjoyable (less frustrating). They would roll through almost daily. Beyond a doubt spoofing when 4 gyms are in view and the 2 furthest apart are ~300 meters.\n\nWe will see how the game plays out with the new formula.

In contrast to what people think of Africa, there is a lot of it that IS populated.

We experienced it happen for Japan with the Lapras event. Hell, it happens daily with the exclusives already so it's far from impossible to keep Pokemon from spawning in more dangerous territories to deter people from making the trip to those territories.\n\nIn the end, we're talking about something considerably unimportant.

The same argument you just made could be flipped around and said for how the old system was, that we were missing out on excellent and rare pokemon at our local pokestops.\n\nI mean if anything, the new tracker should statistically return more rares, as they sample from up to nine spawns vs the sightings menu that samples from only one.\n\nI *do* think allowing both the tracker and sightings menu to appear is a good thing, I just don't agree with this reasoning.", "id": "dar24w8"}, {"comment": "To me, there's one key difference. With the sightings system, I knew that if there's something I'm after close by, it popped up. When it did show up and I had time, I went for a short walk and explored the neighborhood a bit. I tried a few directions and most of the time found the Pok\u00e9mon I was after. There was a whole unknown world beyond the area that was tracked by sightings system but I didn't really care about it, it was \"too far\".\n\nWith the new system, I don't know anything about my surroundings (unless there's a stop close by) and I'm not going to randomly change directions because of \"what if there's something around but tracker doesn't show it?\". In other words, I no longer care about my surroundings and I lost part of the motivation. I simply walk where I'm headed and hope that I bump into something. The new tracker has its advantages - it's nice to see that there's a Bulbasaur next to a Pok\u00e9stop a kilometer away - but if I'm on foot (which is 95% of the time when I'm out) there's a high chance it will disappear before I get there.\n\nWith new tracker, I simply play less.\n\n---\n\n> the new tracker should statistically return more rares, as they sample from up to nine spawns vs the sightings menu that samples from only one.\n\nThey do sample more locations, that's true. However from what I've seen so far, they only show Pok\u00e9mon that are located closest to the stops. And the ultra common Pok\u00e9mon are so prevalent (at least in my area) that I only saw something different only 3-4 times. Most of the time it's 5 Pidgeys, 3 Rattatas and Spearow/Zubat. It seems to me that the algorithm works like this:\n\n    1. for each Pok\u00e9stop on screen\n        get all Pok\u00e9mon closer than 50 meters and put them to list P\n    \n    2. sort list P by distance of each Pok\u00e9mon from their respective (closest) pok\u00e9stop\n    3. display the first 9 Pok\u00e9mon from sorted list P in the tracker\n\nThis is only my personal experience though so it's all subjective and based on a guess. It would be interesting to know how it actually works.\n\n---\n\nYou brought up a few good points which were worth replying to.

"], [6, "Done Facebook, G+, created a Twitter just for it, all when the new system went live west of the Mississippi. It didn't do anything, but I'll try again here.\n\n\nI'm tired, Niantic. I am emotionally exhausted trying to deal with the whole rollercoaster that has been Pok\u00e9monGo from its release. I'm trying to be civil, but at this point, it's hard.\n\nMy wife and I ~~play~~, ~~try to play~~, *used* to play this game together a lot, and we play \"with\" family on the other side of the country.  It has kept us connected with family 2,000 miles away, and for that I thank you.  But no more.  \n\nLosing the three step tracker hurt, but it was understandable given the server loads.  \n\nWhen the beta for the new system was announced months ago, I was dumbfounded. People had already been complaining about how much of a disadvantage rural players were at with a lack of pok\u00e9stops and spawn points, and it was immediately clear then that this new system, if adopted, would make the disparity far worse.\n\nLosing root access phones was not understandable, and effectively banned a large number of legitimate players for no good reason. There is nothing wrong illegal, or even remotely shady about owning a rooted phone, and that was like the community being given the middle finger by you.  I had to make a choice between losing major functionality on a personal device I paid almost $800 for (that's a LOT for us), specifically so that I could root it, or \nnever get to play Pogo again.  I chose to play Pogo again because I have dearly loved the franchise since I was a child, and because of how it brought my family together to play something in a way nothing ever had before.\n\nI now regret that choice.\n\nWhen the Halloween event was announced, my wife and I were very excited. Ghost pok\u00e9mon are absolutely never seen anywhere near where we live, and the two of us played for several hours almost every day the event went on, even driving an hour there and an hour back to the next town over, which had better spawns.  We never saw one ghastly.  All over the internet, people were talking about the number of gengars they were evolving from scratch, three and four at a time. Our relatives, who live in a fairly big city, each were able to evolve five or six gengars.  The disparity between rural and urban play was so very real to us during that time.\n\nThen came the catch and pokestop speed cap.  It doesn't really effect my wife and I much, but it sure effects our family in that big city.  See, their main way of getting pokestops was while riding mass transit to and from work, and they don't have time to go where the pokestops are, afoot, in their off time.  Playing the game suddenly became very hard for them, but still, they have been staunch supporters of the game and of you,  pressing through all the while.\n\nThen, the new tracker hit us in Arizona. At the same time as the thanksgiving event and Ditto.  We tried to play the game, but the new tracker, for the same reasons shouted from the rooftops for months now which I will not pointlessly echo here, simply made play effectively pointless. We gave up on the first day of the event, and haven't been back.  I voiced my concerns and gave feedback, along with a sea of others, and they were not listened to.\n\nToday the update rolled out even further. One of my relatives who, again, lives in a big city where this new tracker is supposed to shine, texted me first thing this morning with this text:\n\n\"The new tracker does suck. Say what you will about them, but it shows Niantic's determination to keep this a free to play game (because nobody is going to buy stuff anymore).\"\n\nHe had been a staunch advocate and a daily player, even after losing the ability to play during his commute. This coming from a location where the new system is supposed to shine.  Now he's done.\n\nWe all are. My whole family is done. Even a Gen 2 release couldn't fix this.  How could it when we wouldn't be able to even catch them?  \n\nThe game has been abandoned by a late portion of it's players, and the servers were expanded months ago. Why can't we have the 3 step system back now? It makes no sense."], [6, "I'll go ahead and get noted the likely reasons for the new tracker here:\n\n1. They may monetize pokestops sometime in the near future.\n\n2. The legalities of this change makes it so that Niantic can now claim that the game no longer entices players to go into areas they should not be.  The location of pokestops are generally known, public places that it is ok for players to go.  Their legal liability is now NONE because the game no longer shows you stuff spawned in your neighbors backyard."], [5, "I think they're semi on the right track with this tracker, but it could be made a lot better.

For me, a Porygon (!) was on the nearby, and I was able to get to it within minutes.

I had this today with a Magmar. There needs to be some hierarchy in terms of what appears (or just axe the commons, as suggested above). \n3) Absolutely kills the game for rural/suburban players.\n3a) Either you only get told what's at the one Pokestop 500 metres away, completely obscuring that Snorlax that spawned 20 metres away... \n3b) ... or you are further than 500 metres away from a Pokestop, and it only lists on the Sightings the Pokemon that have already spawned in the player's spawning circle, making it utterly and completely pointless.\n\nSolutions? I echo other users here by suggesting to simply keep the pre-update system on one tab (named 'Nearby' maybe), and the new system on another tab (named 'Sightings') which the player can switch between at will. This would mean that rural players could keep as they were, possibly seeing if anything was nearby that one nearby Pokestop, and urban players can track Pokemon by Pokestops as they wish. \n\nAny thoughts?"], [3, "Things Niantic must do to fix this shit-show:\n\n* Prioritize rare Pokemon or allow for user-selected filtering of common spawn types. I don't need or want to know about the 6 Pidgey's spawning at Pokestops within 1km of my location, I want to know where that Lapras was that briefly appeared in the list before getting pushed off by all the fucking junk, common spawns.\n* Either add the ability to switch between \"Sightings\" (Pokemon spawned near Pokestops, and \"Nearby\" (Pokemon spawned within 200m of current location or make the list scroll-able\n* Add similar system the current implementation uses to 'nearby' Pokemon. Select them the list, the game secretly notes their location on the map, and you get a distance indicator that helps guide you to their location. I don't need you to show me exactly where on the map these are. That's not much of a game.\n\nThat's what you *must* do. Here's some things that would be *nice*:\n\n* Don't show me Pokemon that are going to despawn before I could reach them with an average walking speed. You've made it *painfully* clear that the game is meant to be played below a certain speed limit so don't show me potential rewards that I can't possibly reach without violating those limits. Simple math here. If time_remaining < distance / reaqsonable_speed_limit\n* Let me tag a *specific* Pokemon(s) and have the game give me offline push-notification that they have spawned within my area. A text message that says 'Hey! There's a Snorlax sighted at a nearby Pokestop. Log in now to find out where!\"\n\nI get that you're trying to drive people to Pokestops for a number of reasons, and that's fine. But the core of the game is still--as far as I know--meant to be about walking around, exploring, and finding random Pokemon. This update has made it nigh impossible to do anything other than just collect what happens to be on your pre-determined path or zip around from Pokestop to Pokestop.

However, I really haven't been all that diligent in checking the nearby list at home anyway, plus there's still the problem of having to actually locate it.\n\nHowever, for me this is a definite upgrade.  My usual Pokemon Go playtime is spent out at a park with 3 gyms and over a dozen pokestops.  It used to not spawn pokemon, but with the change that put pokemon spawns near pokestops and gyms, it spawns plenty.  Yesterday afternoon and each day before, I'd see 9 pokemon nearby, but with no indication of where, that wasn't useful information.  Now, I see 9 sightings, and while the commons don't matter, when something like a Bulbasaur or Magikarp does pop up (I'm level 27, still need Gyarados and evolved starters), I can walk right to it instead of just hoping.  That's a step in the right direction for me (no pun intended).\n\nIt could use some refinement.  I'd love to be able to toggle back to \"nearby\" when I'm not at the park, and use \"sightings\" when I am there.  Also, it needs a filter.

It's cold where I live and there is no way I'm walking my ass to that pokestop in the dark and cold. What if I come home from work, have a few beers (legal adult here), and then a Dragonite pops up nearby, 1/3 mile away? Obviously I am responsible for my actions but the temptation is there. Not to mention even if I did walk it may take 15 minutes to get there, and it could be too late, which is even more incentive to drive.\n\nThis is a stupid, stupid tracking system. They thought showing direction was bad because it might direct people onto private property?

", "id": "dans1mk"}], [{"comment": "Done Facebook, G+, created a Twitter just for it, all when the new system went live west of the Mississippi. It didn't do anything, but I'll try again here.\n\n\nI'm tired, Niantic. I am emotionally exhausted trying to deal with the whole rollercoaster that has been Pok\u00e9monGo from its release. I'm trying to be civil, but at this point, it's hard.\n\nMy wife and I ~~play~~, ~~try to play~~, *used* to play this game together a lot, and we play \"with\" family on the other side of the country.  It has kept us connected with family 2,000 miles away, and for that I thank you.  But no more.  \n\nLosing the three step tracker hurt, but it was understandable given the server loads.  \n\nWhen the beta for the new system was announced months ago, I was dumbfounded. People had already been complaining about how much of a disadvantage rural players were at with a lack of pok\u00e9stops and spawn points, and it was immediately clear then that this new system, if adopted, would make the disparity far worse.\n\nLosing root access phones was not understandable, and effectively banned a large number of legitimate players for no good reason. There is nothing wrong illegal, or even remotely shady about owning a rooted phone, and that was like the community being given the middle finger by you.  I had to make a choice between losing major functionality on a personal device I paid almost $800 for (that's a LOT for us), specifically so that I could root it, or \nnever get to play Pogo again.  I chose to play Pogo again because I have dearly loved the franchise since I was a child, and because of how it brought my family together to play something in a way nothing ever had before.\n\nI now regret that choice.\n\nWhen the Halloween event was announced, my wife and I were very excited. Ghost pok\u00e9mon are absolutely never seen anywhere near where we live, and the two of us played for several hours almost every day the event went on, even driving an hour there and an hour back to the next town over, which had better spawns.  We never saw one ghastly.  All over the internet, people were talking about the number of gengars they were evolving from scratch, three and four at a time. Our relatives, who live in a fairly big city, each were able to evolve five or six gengars.  The disparity between rural and urban play was so very real to us during that time.\n\nThen came the catch and pokestop speed cap.  It doesn't really effect my wife and I much, but it sure effects our family in that big city.  See, their main way of getting pokestops was while riding mass transit to and from work, and they don't have time to go where the pokestops are, afoot, in their off time.  Playing the game suddenly became very hard for them, but still, they have been staunch supporters of the game and of you,  pressing through all the while.\n\nThen, the new tracker hit us in Arizona. At the same time as the thanksgiving event and Ditto.  We tried to play the game, but the new tracker, for the same reasons shouted from the rooftops for months now which I will not pointlessly echo here, simply made play effectively pointless. We gave up on the first day of the event, and haven't been back.  I voiced my concerns and gave feedback, along with a sea of others, and they were not listened to.\n\nToday the update rolled out even further. One of my relatives who, again, lives in a big city where this new tracker is supposed to shine, texted me first thing this morning with this text:\n\n\"The new tracker does suck. Say what you will about them, but it shows Niantic's determination to keep this a free to play game (because nobody is going to buy stuff anymore).\"\n\nHe had been a staunch advocate and a daily player, even after losing the ability to play during his commute. This coming from a location where the new system is supposed to shine.  Now he's done.\n\nWe all are. My whole family is done. Even a Gen 2 release couldn't fix this.  How could it when we wouldn't be able to even catch them?  \n\nThe game has been abandoned by a late portion of it's players, and the servers were expanded months ago.

I echo other users here by suggesting to simply keep the pre-update system on one tab (named 'Nearby' maybe), and the new system on another tab (named 'Sightings') which the player can switch between at will.

The only difference will be the ratio of their stats. For example, a 1000 cp vaporeon will have tons of hp and shitty attack, compared to a 1000 cp seadra.\n\nA pokemon with 0 IVs is just as good as 45 IVs when prestiging. In fact, the 0/0/0 might even have higher stats, because pokemon with one exaggerated stat relative to the others will _lose_ that stat if an equal IV count is applied to each stat.\n\nFor example, Let's say you're prestiging against something with 1200 cp, so you want a 600 cp for maximum prestige. If you had a 15/15/15 gastly, the highest cp under 600 you could get is 587 (level 20, 15/15/15). That gastly would have 121 attack, 51 defense, and 45 stamina.\n\nIf your gastly was 0/0/0, the highest cp you could hit without going beyond 600 is 591, which would be a level **27** gastly, and it's stats would be 130 attack, 49 defense, 42 stamina.\n\nSo the 0/0/0 gastly has 9 more points of attack, at the expense of 2 defense and 3 stamina.\n\nIVs really mean very little when prestiging.", "id": "daro3ad"}], [{"comment": "Nope don't care I max everything and everyone no ones safe you're gonna get maxed too \n\nP.s. please give Stardust need to max my Pinsir to 2600", "id": "daro3k6"}], [{"comment": "No CP cap but I have a level cap.

Then, when you finish training, you'll see that you leveled up the gym and you STILL can't add one of yours.  \n\nNiantic made it harder to \"snipe\", by giving the person who was training priority if they just got the last few points to level it up, but it's still possible to get \"sniped\" if you level it up past the next prestige level and then keep fighting.
