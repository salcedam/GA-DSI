Dire Straits emerged during the post-punk era of the late '70s, and while their sound was minimalistic and stripped down, they owed little to punk. If anything, the band was a direct outgrowth of the roots revivalism of pub rock, but where pub rock celebrated good times, Dire Straits were melancholy. Led by guitarist/vocalist Mark Knopfler, the group built their sound upon the laid-back blues-rock of J.J. Cale, but they also had jazz and country inflections, occasionally dipping into the epic song structures of progressive rock. The band's music was offset by Knopfler's lyrics, which approximated the winding, stream-of-conscious narratives of Bob Dylan. As their career progressed, Dire Straits became more refined and their new maturity happened to coincide with the rise of MTV and the compact disc. These two musical revolutions from the mid-'80s helped make Dire Straits' fifth studio album, Brothers in Arms, an international blockbuster. The band - along with Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, and Steve Winwood - became one of the leaders of a group of self-consciously mature veteran rock & rollers in the late '80s that designed their music to appeal to aging baby boomers. Despite the band's international success, they couldn't sustain their stardom, waiting a full six years to deliver a follow-up to Brothers in Arms, by which time their audience had shrunk significantly.\n\n> Knopfler (born August 12, 1949) was always the main force behind Dire Straits. The son of an architect, Knopfler studied English literature at Leeds University and worked briefly as a rock critic for the Yorkshire Evening Post while at college. He began teaching English after his graduation, leading a pub rock band called \"Brewer's Droop\" at night. By 1977, Mark was playing with his brother David (guitar) and his roommate John Illsley (bass). During the summer of 1977, the trio cut a demo with drummer Pick Withers. A London DJ named Charlie Gillett heard the demo and began playing \"Sultans of Swing\" on his BBC show Honky Tonkin'. Following a tour opening for Talking Heads, the band began recording their debut for Vertigo Records with producer Muff Winwood in early 1978. By the summer, they had signed with Warner in America, releasing their eponymous debut in the fall. Thanks to the Top Ten hit \"Sultans of Swing\", Dire Straits was a major success in both Britain and America, with the single and album climbing into the Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n> The LP \"Dire Straits\" established Dire Straits as a major force on album-oriented radio in America, and their second album, \"Communiqu\u00e9\" (1979), consolidated their audience, selling three million copies worldwide. As the group was recording its third album, David Knopfler left the band to pursue a solo career; he was replaced by former Darling member Hal Lindes. Like its predecessor, \"Making Movies\" was a sizable hit in America and Britain, even though the band was criticized for musically treading water. Nevertheless, the record went gold on the strength of the radio and MTV hits \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Skateaway\". Dire Straits followed the album two years later with \"Love Over Gold\", an album filled with long, experimental passages, plus the single \"Private Investigations\", which became a number two hit in the United Kingdom. The album went gold in America and spent four weeks at number one in Britain. Shortly after the release of \"Love Over Gold\", former Rockpile drummer Terry Williams replaced Withers.\n\n> During 1982, Knopfler began exploring musical avenues outside of Dire Straits, scoring the Bill Forsyth film \"Local Hero\" and playing on Van Morrison's \"Beautiful Vision\". Apart from releasing the \"Twisting by the Pool\" EP early in 1983, Dire Straits were quiet for the majority of 1983 and 1984, as Knopfler produced Bob Dylan's \"Infidels\", as well as Aztec Camera and Willy DeVille; he also wrote \"Private Dancer\" for Tina Turner's comeback album of the same name. \n\n> In the spring of 1984, the band released the double album \"Alchemy: Dire Straits Live\" and by the end of the year, they had begun recording their fifth studio album with their new keyboardist, Guy Fletcher. \n\n> Released in the summer of 1985, \"Brothers in Arms\" was Dire Straits' breakthrough album, making the band international stars. Supported by the groundbreaking computer-animated video for \"Money for Nothing\", a song which mocked music videos, the album became a blockbuster, spending nine weeks at the top of the American charts and selling over nine million copies; in England, the album became the biggest-selling album of the '80s. \"Walk of Life\" and \"So Far Away\" kept \"Brothers in Arms\" in the charts through 1986, and Dire Straits played over 200 dates in support of the album. \n\n> Once the tour was completed, Dire Straits went on hiatus for several years, as Knopfler produced records by Randy Newman and Joan Armatrading, scored films, toured with Eric Clapton, and recorded a duet album with Chet Atkins: \"Neck and Neck\" (1990). In 1989, he formed the country-rock group Notting Hillbillies, whose sole album, \"Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time\", became a British hit upon its spring 1990 release. During the extended time off, John Illsley recorded his second album; the first appeared in 1984.\n\n> In 1990, Knopfler reconvened Dire Straits, which now featured Illsley, Clark, Fletcher, and various session musicians. The band released \"On Every Street\" in autumn 1991 to great anticipation. However, the album failed to meet expectations - it only went platinum in America but went to number one in the UK charts and most of Europe - it failed to generate a hit single in the UK.  The tour embarked on was massive but may have been a bit of a disappointment, with many tickets going unsold in both the U.S. and Europe. Once the tour was completed, the live album \"On the Night\" was released in the spring of 1993 and the band again went on hiatus. \n\n> Dire Straits released one last album in 1995, Live at the BBC, as a contractual album release to Vertigo Records.  That same year, Knopfler disbanded the group.\n\n> In 1996, Knopfler launched his solo career.

Apart from releasing the \"Twisting by the Pool\" EP early in 1983, Dire Straits were quiet for the majority of 1983 and 1984, as Knopfler produced Bob Dylan's \"Infidels\", as well as Aztec Camera and Willy DeVille; he also wrote \"Private Dancer\" for Tina Turner's comeback album of the same name. \n\n> In the spring of 1984, the band released the double album \"Alchemy: Dire Straits Live\" and by the end of the year, they had begun recording their fifth studio album with their new keyboardist, Guy Fletcher. \n\n> Released in the summer of 1985, \"Brothers in Arms\" was Dire Straits' breakthrough album, making the band international stars. Supported by the groundbreaking computer-animated video for \"Money for Nothing\", a song which mocked music videos, the album became a blockbuster, spending nine weeks at the top of the American charts and selling over nine million copies; in England, the album became the biggest-selling album of the '80s. \"Walk of Life\" and \"So Far Away\" kept \"Brothers in Arms\" in the charts through 1986, and Dire Straits played over 200 dates in support of the album. \n\n> Once the tour was completed, Dire Straits went on hiatus for several years, as Knopfler produced records by Randy Newman and Joan Armatrading, scored films, toured with Eric Clapton, and recorded a duet album with Chet Atkins: \"Neck and Neck\" (1990). In 1989, he formed the country-rock group Notting Hillbillies, whose sole album, \"Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time\", became a British hit upon its spring 1990 release. During the extended time off, John Illsley recorded his second album; the first appeared in 1984.\n\n> In 1990, Knopfler reconvened Dire Straits, which now featured Illsley, Clark, Fletcher, and various session musicians. The band released \"On Every Street\" in autumn 1991 to great anticipation. However, the album failed to meet expectations - it only went platinum in America but went to number one in the UK charts and most of Europe - it failed to generate a hit single in the UK.  The tour embarked on was massive but may have been a bit of a disappointment, with many tickets going unsold in both the U.S. and Europe. Once the tour was completed, the live album \"On the Night\" was released in the spring of 1993 and the band again went on hiatus. \n\n> Dire Straits released one last album in 1995, Live at the BBC, as a contractual album release to Vertigo Records.  That same year, Knopfler disbanded the group.\n\n> In 1996, Knopfler launched his solo career.

Cole's hometown of Fayetteville would provide much of the sights and experiences that would come to shape his sound. Cole fell into rapping at the age of 12 when his cousin from Louisiana spent the summer in Fayetteville, showing him the basics of rhyming. He was instantly hooked. From there he delved deep into the music of hip hop luminaries including Tupac Shakur, Nas and Outkast, taking from them a love for telling stories with an unbridled rigor. Seizing every opportunity to write, at age 15 J. Cole found himself with composition notebooks full of rhymes but no beats of his own to lay them on.

She granted his wish and from there, a young Cole spent all his free time creating sounds and songs that would lay the foundation for what his style has evolved to today.\n\n> Feeling the need to be heard, J. Cole used college as a tool to chase his dreams. He attended St. John's University on an academic scholarship, choosing the school so that he could be in the heart of the music industry: New York City. After polishing his sound and graduating Magna Cum Laude, J. Cole is dropping his debut mixtape, properly titled \"The Come Up\" hosted by DJ On Point. A mash up of dusty, soul filled sound beds, raw, energetic drums and an endless range of topics everything from the carefree days of college to the seemingly endless plight of those have-nots scrapping for change. The Come Up puts J. Cole's broad palette of lyrical and production talents on display. \"All a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that, but they rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back,\" he vehemently spits over the cascading keys and triumphant strings of the self produced \"Lil' Ghetto Nigga.\"\n\n> With such a diverse display, J.

After two more solo albums of all original material, he teamed with mandolin master Mike Marshall for a stunning album of duets called Into the Cauldron, which included forays into jazz, world music, and Bach. In 2004 Chris released Deceiver, a departure from his earlier work which contained a variety of pop/rock/folk influenced vocal numbers. In September 2006, he released a new album entitled How to Grow a Woman from the Ground, which consisted of an extensive bluegrass band, and more traditional tracks than his previous album.\n\n> In addition, an announcement was made on the website of Nickel Creek that Thile and his band-mates would be taking an extended hiatus from the band at the end of 2007. He is currently touring with the How to Grow a Band, consisting of members Greg Garrison on bass, Noam Pikelny on banjo, Gabe Witcher on fiddle, and Bryan Sutton on guitar. With the exception of Bryan Sutton, this is the same group of musicians that appear on How to Grow a Woman from the Ground; Chris Eldridge is the guitarist on the album.

After two more solo albums of all original material, he teamed with mandolin master Mike Marshall for a stunning album of duets called Into the Cauldron, which included forays into jazz, world music, and Bach. In 2004 Chris released Deceiver, a departure from his earlier work which contained a variety of pop/rock/folk influenced vocal numbers. In September 2006, he released a new album entitled How to Grow a Woman from the Ground, which consisted of an extensive bluegrass band, and more traditional tracks than his previous album.\n\n> In addition, an announcement was made on the website of Nickel Creek that Thile and his band-mates would be taking an extended hiatus from the band at the end of 2007. He is currently touring with the How to Grow a Band, consisting of members Greg Garrison on bass, Noam Pikelny on banjo, Gabe Witcher on fiddle, and Bryan Sutton on guitar. With the exception of Bryan Sutton, this is the same group of musicians that appear on How to Grow a Woman from the Ground; Chris Eldridge is the guitarist on the album.

Which is *really freaking cool*.\n\nThe really interesting part here is that the fact flew right over your head- and I mean *absolutely no offense* by that, since it flew over my head too, until I re-read the post! Basically, their neural network is able to reproduce the sound of a piano so well that it's indistinguishable from a really good synthesizer. There are so many more directions they could go from here- by retraining the network, you could have it reproduce the sound of any pianist, on any piano, in any venue. It's probably not limited to piano, either- so any instrument, really.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there! Since it's just working with training data, you could conceivably train the network on the sound of *different instruments*, and see what it spits out! Imagine this same melody, but \"played\" by a network that was trained on the sound of both a violin and a piano! Imagine an \"instrument\" which could seamlessly elide between the sound of a flute and the sound of a trumpet! Or a network that can \"cover\" existing songs in a new style, simply by playing it the original! \n\nThis bit of music is completely *ex nihilo*, traditionally speaking and *that's* where the hype comes from.\n\ntl;dr- their existing neural network *composed* the music, their new neural network *synthesized* the music based only on what it \"thinks\" a piano sounds like", "id": "dare4w8"}, {"comment": "Yeah this is so amazing if true that it's hard for me to believe.

They are best known for their eclectic sampling and quirky, surreal lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz hop subgenre. They are the best known of the early alternative hip-hop acts. The members are Kelvin Mercer (Posdnuos, Mercenary, Plug Wonder Why, Plug One), David Jude Jolic\u0153ur (Trugoy the Dove, Dave, Plug Two) and Vincent Mason (Pasemaster Mase, Maseo, Plug Three). The three formed the group in 1987, while still in high school and caught the attention of producer Paul Huston (Prince Paul) with a demo tape of the song \"Plug Tunin'\".\n\n> Their debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising (1989), was a critical smash that saw the group labeled hippies due to the message of peace and love. They quickly became prominent members of the Universal Zulu Nation, along with A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sheep, Queen Latifah, Jungle Brothers and others. They were also members of the famed Native Tongues Posse and mentioned the group often in their music (though they have since left the group for various reasons). \"Me Myself and I\" became a huge hit, further cementing the group's popularity. However, rock group The Turtles sued the group for sampling \"You Showed Me\" without permission on De La Soul's \"Transmitting Live from Mars\". From that point on, sampling required permission from the sources before it was released.\n\n> After 3 Feet High and Rising, De La Soul was pegged by audiences as hippies and were expected to continue creating the same type of music. This greatly agitated the group, as they always envisioned their career as a constantly changing style. This would influence their next recording sessions.\nDe La Soul's second album, De La Soul Is Dead (1991) was a much darker album. It featured skits that criticized the direction that hip hop was heading in at the time, though it still managed to maintain a light sense of humor. While the album is a fan favorite today, it received mixed reviews and did not sell as well as 3 Feet High and Rising.\n\n> 1993's Buhloone Mindstate and 1996's Stakes Is High saw the group evolve a new sound which - though it still failed to garner commercial success - cemented their position as mainstays in the alternative hip-hop movement.\n\n> Four years later, De La Soul announced that they would release a triple album series entitled \"Art Official Intelligence\" (or AOI). All three albums were intended to be released within a year, beginning with the release of Art Official Intelligence: Mosaic Thump. This was followed by AOI: Bionix in late 2001.

They are best known for their eclectic sampling and quirky, surreal lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the jazz hop subgenre. They are the best known of the early alternative hip-hop acts. The members are Kelvin Mercer (Posdnuos, Mercenary, Plug Wonder Why, Plug One), David Jude Jolic\u0153ur (Trugoy the Dove, Dave, Plug Two) and Vincent Mason (Pasemaster Mase, Maseo, Plug Three). The three formed the group in 1987, while still in high school and caught the attention of producer Paul Huston (Prince Paul) with a demo tape of the song \"Plug Tunin'\".\n\n> Their debut album, 3 Feet High and Rising (1989), was a critical smash that saw the group labeled hippies due to the message of peace and love. They quickly became prominent members of the Universal Zulu Nation, along with A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sheep, Queen Latifah, Jungle Brothers and others. They were also members of the famed Native Tongues Posse and mentioned the group often in their music (though they have since left the group for various reasons). \"Me Myself and I\" became a huge hit, further cementing the group's popularity. However, rock group The Turtles sued the group for sampling \"You Showed Me\" without permission on De La Soul's \"Transmitting Live from Mars\". From that point on, sampling required permission from the sources before it was released.\n\n> After 3 Feet High and Rising, De La Soul was pegged by audiences as hippies and were expected to continue creating the same type of music. This greatly agitated the group, as they always envisioned their career as a constantly changing style. This would influence their next recording sessions.\nDe La Soul's second album, De La Soul Is Dead (1991) was a much darker album. It featured skits that criticized the direction that hip hop was heading in at the time, though it still managed to maintain a light sense of humor. While the album is a fan favorite today, it received mixed reviews and did not sell as well as 3 Feet High and Rising.\n\n> 1993's Buhloone Mindstate and 1996's Stakes Is High saw the group evolve a new sound which - though it still failed to garner commercial success - cemented their position as mainstays in the alternative hip-hop movement.\n\n> Four years later, De La Soul announced that they would release a triple album series entitled \"Art Official Intelligence\" (or AOI). All three albums were intended to be released within a year, beginning with the release of Art Official Intelligence: Mosaic Thump. This was followed by AOI: Bionix in late 2001. After this, however, the public saw no release of the third and final album in the AOI series. For the next two years, the only De La Soul releases were singles or remix compilations. Jolic\u0153ur (Dave) stated in an interview that it usually takes about four years for the group to record an album, promote it with advertisements, touring and so on.

Known as one of the most popular duos in modern musical history, they achieved their greatest fame from the late 70s to the mid-80s, having a fusion of rock and roll with rhythm and blues that they dubbed \"rock and soul\". They are best known for their six #1 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"Rich Girl\", \"Kiss on My List\", \"Private Eyes\", \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\", \"Maneater\", and \"Out of Touch\", as well as many other songs which charted in the Top 40.\n\n> In total, the duo had 34 singles chart hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, seven RIAA platinum albums, and six RIAA gold albums. Because of that chart success, Billboard Magazine named them the most successful duo of the rock era, surpassing even The Everly Brothers. In 2003, they were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. They were also placed #15 on the Billboard Magazine list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and the #1 duo, while VH1 placed the duo as #99 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\n\n> From their first hit in 1974 onwards, Daryl Hall and John Oates' smooth, catchy take on Philly soul brought them commercial success\u2014 including six number one singles and six platinum albums as referred to before. Hall & Oates' music was well-constructed and produced; at their best, their songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them by incorporating elements of  arena rock and new wave.\n\n> Daryl Hall, born on October 11, 1946, began performing professionally while he was a student at Temple University. In 1966, he recorded a single with Kenny Gamble and the Romeos; the group featured Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell, who would all become the architects of Philly soul. During this time, Hall frequently appeared on sessions for Gamble and Huff. In 1967, Hall met John Oates, a fellow Temple University student. Oates was leading his own soul band at the time. The two students realized they had similar tastes and began performing together in an array of R&B and doo wop groups. By 1968, the duo had parted ways, as Oates transferred schools and Hall formed the soft rock band Gulliver; the group released one album on Elektra in the late '60s before disbanding.\n\n> After Gulliver's breakup, Hall concentrated on session work again, appearing as a backup vocalist for The Stylistics, The Delfonics, and The Intruders, among others. Oates returned to Philadelphia in 1969, and he and Hall began writing folk-oriented songs and performing together. Eventually they came to the attention of Tommy Mottola, who quickly became their manager, securing the duo a contract with Atlantic Records. On their first records \u2014 Whole Oates (1972), Abandoned Luncheonette (1973), War Babies (1974) \u2014 the duo were establishing their sound, working with producers like Arif Mardin and Todd Rundgren and removing much of their folk influences. At the beginning of 1974, the duo relocated from Philadelphia to New York.

Known as one of the most popular duos in modern musical history, they achieved their greatest fame from the late 70s to the mid-80s, having a fusion of rock and roll with rhythm and blues that they dubbed \"rock and soul\". They are best known for their six #1 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"Rich Girl\", \"Kiss on My List\", \"Private Eyes\", \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\", \"Maneater\", and \"Out of Touch\", as well as many other songs which charted in the Top 40.\n\n> In total, the duo had 34 singles chart hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, seven RIAA platinum albums, and six RIAA gold albums. Because of that chart success, Billboard Magazine named them the most successful duo of the rock era, surpassing even The Everly Brothers. In 2003, they were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. They were also placed #15 on the Billboard Magazine list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and the #1 duo, while VH1 placed the duo as #99 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\n\n> From their first hit in 1974 onwards, Daryl Hall and John Oates' smooth, catchy take on Philly soul brought them commercial success\u2014 including six number one singles and six platinum albums as referred to before. Hall & Oates' music was well-constructed and produced; at their best, their songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them by incorporating elements of  arena rock and new wave.\n\n> Daryl Hall, born on October 11, 1946, began performing professionally while he was a student at Temple University. In 1966, he recorded a single with Kenny Gamble and the Romeos; the group featured Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell, who would all become the architects of Philly soul. During this time, Hall frequently appeared on sessions for Gamble and Huff. In 1967, Hall met John Oates, a fellow Temple University student. Oates was leading his own soul band at the time. The two students realized they had similar tastes and began performing together in an array of R&B and doo wop groups. By 1968, the duo had parted ways, as Oates transferred schools and Hall formed the soft rock band Gulliver; the group released one album on Elektra in the late '60s before disbanding.\n\n> After Gulliver's breakup, Hall concentrated on session work again, appearing as a backup vocalist for The Stylistics, The Delfonics, and The Intruders, among others. Oates returned to Philadelphia in 1969, and he and Hall began writing folk-oriented songs and performing together. Eventually they came to the attention of Tommy Mottola, who quickly became their manager, securing the duo a contract with Atlantic Records. On their first records \u2014 Whole Oates (1972), Abandoned Luncheonette (1973), War Babies (1974) \u2014 the duo were establishing their sound, working with producers like Arif Mardin and Todd Rundgren and removing much of their folk influences. At the beginning of 1974, the duo relocated from Philadelphia to New York. During this period, they only managed one hit \u2014 the number 60 \"She's Gone\" in the spring of 1974.\n\n> After they moved to RCA in 1975, the duo landed on its successful mixture of soul, pop, and rock, scoring a Top Ten single with \"Sara Smile.\" The success of \"Sara Smile\" prompted the re-release of \"She's Gone,\" which rocketed into the Top Ten as well.

Indeed, at the outset, a young Tony Mortimer had been on the verge of signing a solo deal with London Records until ex-Pet Shop Boys manager Tom Watkins suggested that what the world needed was a boy-band antidote to Take That and a band that bad girls could fall in love with. Of course, what Mortimer says now is that he really thought the world needed a UK version of New Kids On The Block and when you think about it this is not a million miles from the inevitable truth. The resultant chaos produced a 1992 debut single, House Of Love, which sold 600,000 copies and a debut album that hit the No.1 spot the following year. The band went on to achieve 18 Top Twenty hits (including Deep, Steam, Let It Rain, It\u2019s Alright and Christmas No.1 Stay Another Day, the latter remaining No.1 for five weeks) as well as four Top Ten albums and sales of over twenty million records. And when East 17 finally split in 1997 it was heralded (and still remains) one of the greatest break-ups in pop history.\n\n> EAST 17 are Tony Mortimer, John Hendy and Terry Coldwell but it hasn\u2019t always been this way. Back in 1991 Mortimer\u2019s school-friend Hendy had been hired to provide backing vocals whilst Coldwell and Brian Harvey (who were three years younger) were originally commandeered as dancers. Tellingly, however, Mortimer heard Harvey singing along in a recording session, noted that his own songwriting skills and rap sensibilities absolutely suited Harvey\u2019s fluid R & B vocal overtones and the latter was elevated to lead singer. The ploy worked and soon East 17 were ubiquitous not just in the UK but throughout the world; It\u2019s Alright made them the biggest band in Mongolia, stayed at No.1 in the Australian charts for seven weeks and when the band visited the country the airport was so mobbed with fans they had to sneak out through the back doors; in 1994 the band\u2019s second album Steam reached No.1 and spawned the epic ballad Stay Another Day which earned Mortimer an Ivor Novello Award; in 1995 the band played to 100,000 in Moscow\u2019s Red Square then watched boggle eyed as the usually stony faced security services danced and sang along with the crowd (some of whom - the band found out later - had sold their shoes in order to be able to attend the show); and in 1996 even a duet with Gabrielle called If You Ever reached No.2.\n In 1997 with little serendipity East 17\u2019s world came crashing down around them. Harvey did a radio interview in which he suggested drugs were cool and \u201cecstasy can make you a better person\u201d and whatever one thinks of his comments now it\u2019s plain to see that they were ill-timed: the country\u2019s media had barely recovered from the ecstasy-related death of Leah Betts and the subsequent tabloid furore was part-fuelled by the singer\u2019s apparent moral abandonment; Harvey was sacked, then Mortimer left and the band imploded. A year later Harvey rejoined but it was never going to work without Mortimer and a No.2 single entitled Time on Telstar was an isolated incident. It was time to call time.\n\n> Fast forward to June this year, East 17 sign to FOD Records, songwriter and main-man Tony Mortimer takes over vocal duties and if a new single called Can\u2019t Get You Out Of My Mind (Crazy) is anything to go by then this move proves to be a revelation. Can\u2019t Get You Out Of My Mind (Crazy) is about a gorgeous girl you notice at a rock \u2018n roll after-show party but more than that \u2013 it marks a sea change in East 17 repertoire that sees them sound like a cross between Summer Of \u201869/Boys Of Summer Americana and, well, bands like Coldplay and U2 it would seem. Mortimer explains the change in direction. \u201cI think everyone is subconsciously inspired by American music and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. And this time around I just wanted to do something more live and when you start out with drum machines you always have to compromise with that music when you play live anyway. So why not try and be as live as you can in the studio? I love dance music and that is the core of what we do but we now just take the energy from that.\u201d John suggests, \u201cWe\u2019re older now and a younger sound wouldn\u2019t suit us. It\u2019s funny \u2013 we used to get compared to Take That even though they were bubblegum pop and we were much harder and edgier. Now their new material is much more grown up and I guess it kind of makes sense for us to do a grown up rock thing. And anyway, it suits Tony\u2019s voice more!\u201d Fittingly, flirtingly, Terry goes further, adding, \u201cBelieve it or not, we\u2019ve always liked bands like Coldplay and U2, and we need to go this way.\u201d\n\n>  Just as in their original, mega-successful incarnation Mortimer has written the majority of material for the new album: Counting Clouds is an intensely personal song about Mortimer\u2019s wife preparing to go into hospital to have a spinal operation and him promising her that he can\u2019t wait to take her on holiday so they can walk on a beach and count clouds. Crazy Fool is about not being able to express how you feel in a relationship; and Broken Valentine is about a guy who is attracted to woman who is completely out of his depth and she doesn\u2019t even know he exists. Additionally, Coldwell provides two numbers - You Shine, a song about a girl who completely changes your life around and Afterlife which is about a man who dies but continues to looks after his girlfriend from the afterlife. They\u2019re both enormous-sounding as is the entire record and it\u2019s a record you can see both America and the open-top car industry embracing in abundance.\n\n> Earlier this year T Mobile commissioned a Royal Wedding spoof commercial which garnered more than twenty million You Tube Clips in a couple of weeks. To soundtrack the ad you can bet they were looking for something cheeky, irreverend and loved by the great British public. And you can bet that they didn\u2019t have to look much further than East 17\u2019s The House Of Love. Nowadays, of course, that song seems an age away and you\u2019d be far more likely to see East 17 sound-tracking a movie featuring roller-coasters and freeways \u2013 but nothing changes: they\u2019re still cheeky, irreverend and much loved. Oh, it\u2019s great to have them back.\n\n> new single from the upcoming EAST 17 album \"DARK LIGHT\" (2012)\npre-order on iTunes here : http://bit.ly/w71u82\n\n> East 17 updates:\nwww.east17official.com\nwww.facebook.com/East17official\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/East17official\nwww.fodrecords.com Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/East+17): 162,014 listeners, 1,064,257 plays  \n tags: *pop, 90s, dance, british, boyband*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0."]], [[{"comment": "**East 17**  \n [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/53610407d80344e0b22eac888bf7f5e4.png)  \n\n> When East 17 stumbled into the Walthamstow, England limelight in late 1991 they had little idea that their rabble-rousing brand of boy-band pop would create such a storm.

The ploy worked and soon East 17 were ubiquitous not just in the UK but throughout the world; It\u2019s Alright made them the biggest band in Mongolia, stayed at No.1 in the Australian charts for seven weeks and when the band visited the country the airport was so mobbed with fans they had to sneak out through the back doors; in 1994 the band\u2019s second album Steam reached No.1 and spawned the epic ballad Stay Another Day which earned Mortimer an Ivor Novello Award; in 1995 the band played to 100,000 in Moscow\u2019s Red Square then watched boggle eyed as the usually stony faced security services danced and sang along with the crowd (some of whom - the band found out later - had sold their shoes in order to be able to attend the show); and in 1996 even a duet with Gabrielle called If You Ever reached No.2.\n In 1997 with little serendipity East 17\u2019s world came crashing down around them. Harvey did a radio interview in which he suggested drugs were cool and \u201cecstasy can make you a better person\u201d and whatever one thinks of his comments now it\u2019s plain to see that they were ill-timed: the country\u2019s media had barely recovered from the ecstasy-related death of Leah Betts and the subsequent tabloid furore was part-fuelled by the singer\u2019s apparent moral abandonment; Harvey was sacked, then Mortimer left and the band imploded. A year later Harvey rejoined but it was never going to work without Mortimer and a No.2 single entitled Time on Telstar was an isolated incident. It was time to call time.\n\n> Fast forward to June this year, East 17 sign to FOD Records, songwriter and main-man Tony Mortimer takes over vocal duties and if a new single called Can\u2019t Get You Out Of My Mind (Crazy) is anything to go by then this move proves to be a revelation. Can\u2019t Get You Out Of My Mind (Crazy) is about a gorgeous girl you notice at a rock \u2018n roll after-show party but more than that \u2013 it marks a sea change in East 17 repertoire that sees them sound like a cross between Summer Of \u201869/Boys Of Summer Americana and, well, bands like Coldplay and U2 it would seem. Mortimer explains the change in direction. \u201cI think everyone is subconsciously inspired by American music and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. And this time around I just wanted to do something more live and when you start out with drum machines you always have to compromise with that music when you play live anyway. So why not try and be as live as you can in the studio? I love dance music and that is the core of what we do but we now just take the energy from that.\u201d John suggests, \u201cWe\u2019re older now and a younger sound wouldn\u2019t suit us. It\u2019s funny \u2013 we used to get compared to Take That even though they were bubblegum pop and we were much harder and edgier. Now their new material is much more grown up and I guess it kind of makes sense for us to do a grown up rock thing. And anyway, it suits Tony\u2019s voice more!\u201d Fittingly, flirtingly, Terry goes further, adding, \u201cBelieve it or not, we\u2019ve always liked bands like Coldplay and U2, and we need to go this way.\u201d\n\n>  Just as in their original, mega-successful incarnation Mortimer has written the majority of material for the new album: Counting Clouds is an intensely personal song about Mortimer\u2019s wife preparing to go into hospital to have a spinal operation and him promising her that he can\u2019t wait to take her on holiday so they can walk on a beach and count clouds. Crazy Fool is about not being able to express how you feel in a relationship; and Broken Valentine is about a guy who is attracted to woman who is completely out of his depth and she doesn\u2019t even know he exists. Additionally, Coldwell provides two numbers - You Shine, a song about a girl who completely changes your life around and Afterlife which is about a man who dies but continues to looks after his girlfriend from the afterlife. They\u2019re both enormous-sounding as is the entire record and it\u2019s a record you can see both America and the open-top car industry embracing in abundance.\n\n> Earlier this year T Mobile commissioned a Royal Wedding spoof commercial which garnered more than twenty million You Tube Clips in a couple of weeks. To soundtrack the ad you can bet they were looking for something cheeky, irreverend and loved by the great British public. And you can bet that they didn\u2019t have to look much further than East 17\u2019s The House Of Love. Nowadays, of course, that song seems an age away and you\u2019d be far more likely to see East 17 sound-tracking a movie featuring roller-coasters and freeways \u2013 but nothing changes: they\u2019re still cheeky, irreverend and much loved. Oh, it\u2019s great to have them back.\n\n> new single from the upcoming EAST 17 album \"DARK LIGHT\" (2012)\npre-order on iTunes here : http://bit.ly/w71u82\n\n> East 17 updates:\nwww.east17official.com\nwww.facebook.com/East17official\nhttp://twitter.com/#!/East17official\nwww.fodrecords.com Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/East+17): 162,014 listeners, 1,064,257 plays  \n tags: *pop, 90s, dance, british, boyband*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0.", "id": "dar10gs"}]]], "5ga4rj": ["(Don't Fear) The Reaper - Live [Rock]", "2016-12-03 18:53:57", 34, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8VhFooPsfA", [[3, "Always liked this.

It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 with approximately 218,000 units sold.\n\n> Cole has appeared on the cover of The Source and Beyond Race magazines, as well as being featured as one of XXL\u2019s 2010 Freshmen. Cole appeared on Jay-Z\u2019s 2009 album The Blueprint 3, on the track A Star is Born, and is also featured on labelmate Wale\u2019s debut album, Attention Deficit. Most recently, he was touring with Jay-Z, Young Jeezy, and Trey Songz on The Blueprint 3 tour.

Seizing every opportunity to write, at age 15 J. Cole found himself with composition notebooks full of rhymes but no beats of his own to lay them on.

The Come Up puts J.

On their first demo, Sanjiv contributed vocals. In 1987, bassist and vocalist Jeffrey Walker, formerly of the Electro Hippies, joined them.\n\n> The band focused on topics mostly relating to the medical field and bizarre combinations of medical equipment and chemicals with human anatomy, such as \"Intenacious, intersecting / Reaving fats from corporal griskin [...] Skeletal groats triturated, desinently exsiccated\". This lyrical focus led many in the music press to falsely believe that one or more members of the band had studied medicine. There is more evidence to show that this lyrical focus was a method of pushing vegetarianism (For example, \"Exhume To Consume\"). Typical Carcass song titles from their early work include \"Lavaging Expectorate of Lysergide Composition\" and \"Microwaved Uterogestation.\"\n\n> Having started their career as a goregrind band, Carcass gradually changed their sound and lyrical content. Starting with the album 'Necroticism - Descanting The Insalubrious', the careful listener could hear music-theoretic experimentation beyond the amodal noise of previous work, and even a hint of the harmonic minor scales that would later crystallise more fully. Their best-known album, Heartwork, was largely devoid of the gory lyrics and grind style that had been present on their earlier recordings, with a cleaner, more melodic sound, but retaining occasional forays out of more complex harmonies into atonal grind.\n\n> With Carcass having signed to Sony before the release of Heartwork, some fans regarded the evolved sound as proof of the sellout they had expected. In contrast, many were very receptive to what was perceived as a new zenith of talent and composition in death metal, showing a command of motif development and harmony that is underappreciated even within the metal community. In fact, today some credit Carcass with being a very early founding influence for not just one, but two genres of metal - grindcore (or, more specifically, goregrind), and the melodic death metal sound. Michael Amott left the band right after Heartwork was recorded and was for a while replaced by Mike Hickey who was later replaced by Carlo Regadas. Carcass broke up in 1995 after releasing Swansong, which drew some criticism from fans for its melodic riffs which in some ways bordered on late 1980s thrash.\n\n> Ken, Jeff and Carlo continued with the Blackstar project accompanied with former Cathedral bassist Mark Griffiths. Blackstar (Later Blackstar Rising) went defunct after Ken suffered from a severe brain haemorrhage. Michael Amott went on to found hard rocking combo Spiritual Beggars and the melodic death metal band Arch Enemy.. In the biggest musical departure, Bill Steer reappeared in Firebird, a Claptonesque guitar-rock trio.\n\n> In June 2006, in an interview with Walker, he discussed the possibility of reforming Carcass. In September 2007 it was confirmed by Michael Amott that he had been rehearsing with Bill Steer, Jeff Walker and Daniel Erlandsson (replacing Ken Owen, who is incapable of playing a full set with Carcass due to health reasons) in secret to rehearse old Carcass songs for a possible reunion tour. The original plans were to play at several festivals during the summer, but they couldn't meet the deadlines.\n\n> In October 2007, Carcass were confirmed to play at German heavy metal festival Wacken Open Air and Finland's Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in 2008. Carcass later embarked on a reunion tour, beginning on June 6, 2008. Carcass also played at Hellfest Summer Open Air, Metalcamp and several other festivals. The band toured Australia and New Zealand in 2008, and then in North America during September and October 2008, followed by the band's first South American tour, playing in Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.\n\n> Carcass continued to play live in 2009, with a North American tour completed in March 2009.

He was born in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens, Lancashire, England. Astley currently resides in Richmond, Surrey with his Danish girlfriend, Lene Bausager, and their daughter, Emilie.\n\n> In 1985, Astley was playing the club circuit as a singer with a soul band named FBI, when he was seen by the record producer Pete Waterman and persuaded to come to London to work at the PWL recording studio. Under the tutelage of production trio Stock Aitken Waterman, Astley was taught about the recording process and groomed for his future career, supposedly starting off as the recording studio 'tea boy'. During much of his career prior to the proliferation of music videos, many listeners assumed he was black. In one instance, the comedic entertainer, Sinbad, discussed him with a talk-show host, expressing his surprise that Astley was not \"one of the brothers.\" Even after his visual appearance, it was still popular belief that he was miming for a black American singer. His brother Mark Astley helped to refute this assertion.\n\n> His first single was the little-known \"When You Gonna\" credited to Rick & Lisa, but his first solo outing was \"Never Gonna Give You Up,\" released in 1987. It became an immediate success, spending five weeks at the top of the British charts and becoming the year's highest-selling single. It was the first of no fewer than 13 (world-wide) Top 30 hit singles for him. \n\n> The album Whenever You Need Somebody also reached Number One in the UK, and the hit singles continued, including the title track and a cover of Nat King Cole's \"When I Fall In Love.\"\n\n> On 12 March 1988, \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" had also topped the U.S. singles chart and was followed by a second U.S. #1 on 18 June with his second U.S. single release \"Together Forever.\"\n\n> By the end of the decade, Astley had parted company with Stock Aitken Waterman. He achieved one more major success with the 1991 ballad \"Cry For Help,\" which reached the Top 10 in both the UK and the U.S. It featured a gospel choir arranged by Andra\u00e9 Crouch, who'd also been involved with Madonna's 1989 hit \"Like A Prayer.\"\n\n> His next album Body & Soul was released in 1993. The album did not chart in the U.K. and managed to make The Billboard 200 peaking at a lowly #182. The two singles, The Ones You Love and Hopelessly performed very well on the adult contemporary chart, peaking at #19 and #4 respectively. Hopelessly also crossed over and peaked at #31 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart. For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, Astley remained largely out of the spotlight.\n\n> In 1991 the RIAA certified that two million copies of Whenever You Need Somebody had been sold. Total world sales of Astley's records (inclusive of singles, albums and compilation inclusions) have reached 40 million.\n\n> Almost 10 years after \"Body & Soul\", Rick finally returned to the music world and released \"Keep It Turned On\" in 2002. The album featured the single \"Sleeping\", which became a minor club hit, thanks to a set of remixes from U.S. house producer Todd Terry.\n\n> In 2005 Astley released the album Portrait in which he covered many classic soul standards such as \"Vincent\", \"Nature Boy\" and \"Close To You\".\n\n> In early 2006, Astley withdrew unexpectedly at the eleventh hour from appearing on the BBC TV celebrity/pro duets show Just the Two of Us after committing to the series. This led to criticism from those in the entertainment industry and media. His place was filled by opera singer Russell Watson, who eventually won the competition. The BBC failed to explain that Astley's withdrawal was due to his partner Lene Bausager being nominated for the 2006 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for her produced/directed film \"Cashback\". Astley would have missed a crucial part of the show by attending the awards ceremony and so withdrew before the show started its run.\n\n> Based on various music charts in the UK, U.S. and Canada, Astley has charted a grand total of 14 (different) hit singles and 6 (different) hit albums as of March 2006.\n\n> During the later part of 2006 and the beginning of 2007, the song \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" became part of an internet meme similar to the \"Duckrolling\" of the 4chan game forums.  A link would be submitted to the forum, in the first instances to a supposed trailer of a new game, and would redirect the user to the video.  This process fondly became known as a \"Rickroll\", and the usage of which has developed exponentially since.

The group is currently signed to Sumerian Records, have released five full-length studio albums, the latest being Matriarch, and are often considered to be a contributor in the \"djent\" scene. The name of the band is derived from the Cynic song of the same name. The band originally took use of multiple guitar players, but since 2007 Okubo has been the only guitarist the band employs.\n\n> Veil of Maya originally formed after melodic death metal band Insurrection broke-up, which led to members Marc Okubo (lead guitar) and Sam Applebaum (drums) to begin a new project. Okubo and Applebaum were joined by bassist Kris Hilger, guitarist Timothy Marshall and vocalist Adam Clemans; who all decided on naming the band Veil of Maya.\n\n> After recording a demo in 2005, the band inducted guitarist Scott Okarma into the group in 2006 while they played and booked shows in their local area. With Okarma's inception, Veil of Maya at this point were a six piece that employed three guitarists, however, both Marshall and Okarma shortly thereafter left the band, and the members found Bryan Ruppell to replace them both.\n\n> With this five member line-up, the band recorded, self-produced and released their debut full-length album All Things Set Aside through Corrosive Recordings in 2006. After this debut, vocalist Clemans and guitarist Ruppell would both leave the group, which then had Veil of Maya in search for a new vocalist which led to them discovering 20-year old Brandon Butler, who was formerly part of a Christian metal band named Iscariot. Butler joined in 2007, however, the band decided not to search for a new rhythm guitarist, thus leaving Veil of Maya as a four piece.\n\n> After Butler's inception and after gaining exposure through tours and interviews, Veil of Maya signed with Sumerian Records in January 2008. Sumerian manager Shawn Keith and founder Ash Avildsen were both reportedly very ecstatic and interested in signing the band. Veil of Maya's second album, The Common Man's Collapse was recorded with Butler in 2008 and released the same year. Being Veil of Maya's first album through the much larger label that Sumerian is, it was produced in better quality than their debut. After this release, the band parted ways their original bassist Kristopher \"Kris\" Higler in 2009, he was replaced by Matthew Pantelis.\n\n> After their second album's release, the following several months held extensive touring before the writing and recording for the group's third full-length, [id] began. [id] was released on April 6, 2010, and reached number 107 on the Billboard 200. The band worked again with producer Michael Keene from The Faceless for this album, who previously produced The Common Man's Collapse. The album's name was derived from the main character of the PlayStation game Xenogears, the album itself also holds several concepts and references to other topics in popular culture, especially television shows.\n\n> After [id], Pantlis as well left the band, which lead to Dan Hauser replacing him in 2010, the band's current bassist. On January 13, 2012, Sumerian Records released a teaser for Veil of Maya's most recent album, Eclipse. On January 17, the single \"Vicious Circles\" was released onto the iTunes Store.

The group is currently signed to Sumerian Records, have released five full-length studio albums, the latest being Matriarch, and are often considered to be a contributor in the \"djent\" scene. The name of the band is derived from the Cynic song of the same name. The band originally took use of multiple guitar players, but since 2007 Okubo has been the only guitarist the band employs.\n\n> Veil of Maya originally formed after melodic death metal band Insurrection broke-up, which led to members Marc Okubo (lead guitar) and Sam Applebaum (drums) to begin a new project. Okubo and Applebaum were joined by bassist Kris Hilger, guitarist Timothy Marshall and vocalist Adam Clemans; who all decided on naming the band Veil of Maya.\n\n> After recording a demo in 2005, the band inducted guitarist Scott Okarma into the group in 2006 while they played and booked shows in their local area. With Okarma's inception, Veil of Maya at this point were a six piece that employed three guitarists, however, both Marshall and Okarma shortly thereafter left the band, and the members found Bryan Ruppell to replace them both.\n\n> With this five member line-up, the band recorded, self-produced and released their debut full-length album All Things Set Aside through Corrosive Recordings in 2006. After this debut, vocalist Clemans and guitarist Ruppell would both leave the group, which then had Veil of Maya in search for a new vocalist which led to them discovering 20-year old Brandon Butler, who was formerly part of a Christian metal band named Iscariot. Butler joined in 2007, however, the band decided not to search for a new rhythm guitarist, thus leaving Veil of Maya as a four piece.\n\n> After Butler's inception and after gaining exposure through tours and interviews, Veil of Maya signed with Sumerian Records in January 2008. Sumerian manager Shawn Keith and founder Ash Avildsen were both reportedly very ecstatic and interested in signing the band. Veil of Maya's second album, The Common Man's Collapse was recorded with Butler in 2008 and released the same year. Being Veil of Maya's first album through the much larger label that Sumerian is, it was produced in better quality than their debut. After this release, the band parted ways their original bassist Kristopher \"Kris\" Higler in 2009, he was replaced by Matthew Pantelis.\n\n> After their second album's release, the following several months held extensive touring before the writing and recording for the group's third full-length, [id] began. [id] was released on April 6, 2010, and reached number 107 on the Billboard 200. The band worked again with producer Michael Keene from The Faceless for this album, who previously produced The Common Man's Collapse. The album's name was derived from the main character of the PlayStation game Xenogears, the album itself also holds several concepts and references to other topics in popular culture, especially television shows.\n\n> After [id], Pantlis as well left the band, which lead to Dan Hauser replacing him in 2010, the band's current bassist. On January 13, 2012, Sumerian Records released a teaser for Veil of Maya's most recent album, Eclipse. On January 17, the single \"Vicious Circles\" was released onto the iTunes Store. Eclipse was then released on February 28, 2012 and was produced by Periphery guitarist Misha Mansoor.

None of this was apparent when S\u00d3LSTAFIR released their album debut \"\u00cd Bl\u00f3\u00f0i og Anda\", which translates as 'In Blood and Spirit' in 2002. Instead of today's Icelandic gravel throated siren chants, frontman A\u00f0albj\u00f6rn Tryggvason spit forth vitriolic crust-like vocals and the ripping guitars were clearly black metal inspired.

With \"\u00d3tta\" the Icelanders touch something ancient and timeless, while defying easy categorisation. This album needs to be heard again and again to peel back layers of details, each different and yet always revealing the same: great songs \u2013 all of them.

Known as one of the most popular duos in modern musical history, they achieved their greatest fame from the late 70s to the mid-80s, having a fusion of rock and roll with rhythm and blues that they dubbed \"rock and soul\". They are best known for their six #1 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"Rich Girl\", \"Kiss on My List\", \"Private Eyes\", \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\", \"Maneater\", and \"Out of Touch\", as well as many other songs which charted in the Top 40.\n\n> In total, the duo had 34 singles chart hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, seven RIAA platinum albums, and six RIAA gold albums. Because of that chart success, Billboard Magazine named them the most successful duo of the rock era, surpassing even The Everly Brothers. In 2003, they were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. They were also placed #15 on the Billboard Magazine list of the 100 greatest artists of all time and the #1 duo, while VH1 placed the duo as #99 on their list of the 100 greatest artists of all time.\n\n> From their first hit in 1974 onwards, Daryl Hall and John Oates' smooth, catchy take on Philly soul brought them commercial success\u2014 including six number one singles and six platinum albums as referred to before. Hall & Oates' music was well-constructed and produced; at their best, their songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them by incorporating elements of  arena rock and new wave.\n\n> Daryl Hall, born on October 11, 1946, began performing professionally while he was a student at Temple University. In 1966, he recorded a single with Kenny Gamble and the Romeos; the group featured Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell, who would all become the architects of Philly soul. During this time, Hall frequently appeared on sessions for Gamble and Huff. In 1967, Hall met John Oates, a fellow Temple University student. Oates was leading his own soul band at the time. The two students realized they had similar tastes and began performing together in an array of R&B and doo wop groups. By 1968, the duo had parted ways, as Oates transferred schools and Hall formed the soft rock band Gulliver; the group released one album on Elektra in the late '60s before disbanding.\n\n> After Gulliver's breakup, Hall concentrated on session work again, appearing as a backup vocalist for The Stylistics, The Delfonics, and The Intruders, among others. Oates returned to Philadelphia in 1969, and he and Hall began writing folk-oriented songs and performing together. Eventually they came to the attention of Tommy Mottola, who quickly became their manager, securing the duo a contract with Atlantic Records. On their first records \u2014 Whole Oates (1972), Abandoned Luncheonette (1973), War Babies (1974) \u2014 the duo were establishing their sound, working with producers like Arif Mardin and Todd Rundgren and removing much of their folk influences. At the beginning of 1974, the duo relocated from Philadelphia to New York. During this period, they only managed one hit \u2014 the number 60 \"She's Gone\" in the spring of 1974.\n\n> After they moved to RCA in 1975, the duo landed on its successful mixture of soul, pop, and rock, scoring a Top Ten single with \"Sara Smile.\" The success of \"Sara Smile\" prompted the re-release of \"She's Gone,\" which rocketed into the Top Ten as well. Released in the summer of 1976, Bigger than the Both of Us was only moderately successful upon its release. The record took off in early 1977, when \"Rich Girl\" became the duo's first number one single.\n\n> Although they had several minor hits between 1977 and 1980, the albums Hall & Oates released at the end of the decade were not as successful as their mid-'70s records. Nevertheless, they were more adventurous, incorporating more rock elements into their blue-eyed soul. The combination would finally pay off in late 1980, when the duo released the self-produced Voices, the album that marked the beginning of Hall & Oates' greatest commercial and artistic success. The first single from Voices, a cover of Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling,\" reached number 12, yet it was the second single, \"Kiss on My List\" that confirmed their commercial potential by becoming the duo's second number one single; its follow-up, \"You Make My Dreams\" hit number five. They quickly released Private Eyes in the summer of 1981; the record featured two number one hits, \"Private Eyes\" and \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do),\" as well as the Top Ten hit \"Did It in a Minute.\" \"I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)\" also spent a week at the top of the R&B charts \u2014 a rare accomplishment for a white act. H20 followed in 1982 and it proved more successful than their two previous albums, selling over two million copies and launching their biggest hit single, \"Maneater,\" as well as the Top Ten hits \"One on One\" and \"Family Man.\" The following year, the duo released a greatest-hits compilation, Rock 'N Soul, Pt. 1, that featured two new Top Ten hits \u2014 the number two \"Say It Isn't So\" and \"Adult Education.\"\n\n> In April of 1984, the Recording Industry Association of America announced that Hall & Oates had surpassed Everly Brothers as the most successful duo in rock history, earning a total of 19 gold and platinum awards. Released in October of 1984, Big Bam Boom expanded their number of gold and platinum awards, selling over two million copies and launching four Top 40 singles, including the number one \"Out of Touch.\" Following their contract-fulfilling gold album Live at the Apollo with David Ruffin & Eddie Kendrick, Hall & Oates went on hiatus. After the lukewarm reception for Daryl Hall's 1986 solo album, Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine, the duo regrouped to release 1988's Ooh Yeah!, their first record for Arista. The first single, \"Everything Your Heart Desires,\" went to number three and helped propel the album to platinum status.\n\n> However, none of the album's other singles broke the Top 20, indicating that the era of chart dominance had ended. Change of Season, released in 1990, confirmed that fact. Although the record went gold, it only featured one Top 40 hit \u2014 the number 11 single, \"So Close.\" The duo mounted a comeback in 1997 with Marigold Sky, but it was only partially successful; far better was 2003's Do It for Love and the following year soul covers record Our Kind of Soul.

Cole, is an American rapper and producer from Fayetteville, North Carolina. He is best known for being the first artist to be signed to Jay-Z's label Roc Nation after Jay heard his single Lights Please. He released his debut mixtape The Come Up in 2007 and followed this up with 2009's The Warm Up and 2010's Friday Night Lights. Songfacts reports that he dropped his first official single, Work Out on June 15, 2011, the two-year anniversary of The Warm Up.  He released his highly anticipated debut album \"Cole World: The Sideline Story\" on Tuesday, September 27, 2011. It debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 with approximately 218,000 units sold.\n\n> Cole has appeared on the cover of The Source and Beyond Race magazines, as well as being featured as one of XXL\u2019s 2010 Freshmen. Cole appeared on Jay-Z\u2019s 2009 album The Blueprint 3, on the track A Star is Born, and is also featured on labelmate Wale\u2019s debut album, Attention Deficit. Most recently, he was touring with Jay-Z, Young Jeezy, and Trey Songz on The Blueprint 3 tour. In January 2010, along with Jay Electronica and Mos Def, he appeared on the first single from the new Reflection Eternal album, Just Begun.\n\n> The rap world is at a crossroads. In the face of shrinking budgets, music executives, resting on their laurels, search out the next YouTube sensation with a catchy hook and dance move in order to amass digital single sales. While many artists have tried to break through despite an industry melt down, few have been met with critical praise. And the applause for those that have has not been loud enough to sway the course of the current rap market. Looking to excel where his contemporaries have failed, North Carolina native J. Cole (born Jermaine Cole) brings promise of a new day in hip hop music.Raised by his mother in North Carolina, J. Cole's hometown of Fayetteville would provide much of the sights and experiences that would come to shape his sound. Cole fell into rapping at the age of 12 when his cousin from Louisiana spent the summer in Fayetteville, showing him the basics of rhyming. He was instantly hooked. From there he delved deep into the music of hip hop luminaries including Tupac Shakur, Nas and Outkast, taking from them a love for telling stories with an unbridled rigor. Seizing every opportunity to write, at age 15 J. Cole found himself with composition notebooks full of rhymes but no beats of his own to lay them on. Determined to create original songs, he begged his mother for a beat machine so he could produce music solely for himself. She granted his wish and from there, a young Cole spent all his free time creating sounds and songs that would lay the foundation for what his style has evolved to today.\n\n> Feeling the need to be heard, J. Cole used college as a tool to chase his dreams. He attended St. John's University on an academic scholarship, choosing the school so that he could be in the heart of the music industry: New York City. After polishing his sound and graduating Magna Cum Laude, J. Cole is dropping his debut mixtape, properly titled \"The Come Up\" hosted by DJ On Point. A mash up of dusty, soul filled sound beds, raw, energetic drums and an endless range of topics everything from the carefree days of college to the seemingly endless plight of those have-nots scrapping for change. The Come Up puts J. Cole's broad palette of lyrical and production talents on display. \"All a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that, but they rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back,\" he vehemently spits over the cascading keys and triumphant strings of the self produced \"Lil' Ghetto Nigga.\"\n\n> With such a diverse display, J. Cole is poised to wake up a dormant industry and cement his name in this game. But more than that, with his debut studio album currently in production, he hopes to change the tide of current rap music, swaying it in a more insightful, meaningful and passionate direction.\" Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/J.+Cole): 1,376,025 listeners, 24,322,636 plays  \n tags: *Hip-Hop, rap, underground hip-hop, Jazz Hop, North Carolina*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0."], [18, "God damn he's so good \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc"], [12, "I dont know who pissed him off but he's on a killing spree.

After polishing his sound and graduating Magna Cum Laude, J. Cole is dropping his debut mixtape, properly titled \"The Come Up\" hosted by DJ On Point. A mash up of dusty, soul filled sound beds, raw, energetic drums and an endless range of topics everything from the carefree days of college to the seemingly endless plight of those have-nots scrapping for change. The Come Up puts J. Cole's broad palette of lyrical and production talents on display. \"All a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that, but they rather lock us up and make sure we don't come back,\" he vehemently spits over the cascading keys and triumphant strings of the self produced \"Lil' Ghetto Nigga.\"\n\n> With such a diverse display, J. Cole is poised to wake up a dormant industry and cement his name in this game. But more than that, with his debut studio album currently in production, he hopes to change the tide of current rap music, swaying it in a more insightful, meaningful and passionate direction.\" Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/J.+Cole): 1,376,025 listeners, 24,322,636 plays  \n tags: *Hip-Hop, rap, underground hip-hop, Jazz Hop, North Carolina*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0.", "id": "daqlifb"}], [{"comment": "God damn he's so good \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc", "id": "daqr92d"}], [{"comment": "I dont know who pissed him off but he's on a killing spree.

Instead, he is rejecting the fact that the music industry is controlled by an elite few and structured to milk money from artists. The \"white man\" is a generalized persona and not an actual statement about the race of the person oppressing artists.  He is discrediting those artists because their existence is disingenuous. \n\nThis is a common theme for J Cole and Kendrick Lamar over the past few years.  For Kendrick it's quite a bit more complicated, where the \"white man\" is one characteristic of the industry which results in a love/hate relationship. The entirety of To Pimp A Butterfly can be interpreted from this perspective and recently Kendrick has even continued this theme with his features (see Bad Blood remix with Taylor Swift).

This may seem a bit late, now that it's January 6th and all, but actually, I've got a reason for posting it today. :)  Today is the day of Epiphany, a day when the coming of the wise men is celebrated, much as Christ's birth is celebrated on December 25th. Way back in the day, there was this thing called the Twelve Days of Christmas, or 'Christmastide', when the coming of Christ was celebrated, from December 25th to January 6th... there's still some people that celebrate it this way, I'm sure, but I imagine most don't nowadays... but, I thought I'd celebrate a bit by posting this. :) So, at least in some circles, today, Epiphany, is the official end of  the Christmas season. :) For a little education, the wise men (or Magi), contrary to what many Christmas cards would have us believe, actually showed up two years after Christ's birth, according to the Gospel of Matthew (better late than never, I'd say). And also, there's really no certainty that there were three of them. The Gospel of Matthew doesn't say how many there were. The educated guess is three because they brought three gifts (gold, frankincense, and myrrh). :) Anyways, I've always liked the story of the wise men. Just the picture in my mind of some old men, traveling alone through the night in the desert, under the stars, captures my imagination...  And it makes me wonder... What were they thinking? And did they have any doubts? Did they wonder if they were just crazy sometimes, following some star to find a child in some obscure town?  I can relate to their journey. It must have been long and hard, and they must have wondered what they would find, and maybe if it was even worth the journey. But they kept going, and they had faith, and hope... and finally found what they were looking for... which is encouraging to me. :) Also, I love gazing at the stars. Sometimes I go out, when the weather's good, and with my dog usually, in the middle of the night, and walk out under the stars and think, and pray, and explore... sure beats watching TV, I'll tell you. :) Well, I hope you enjoy this video. :)  May you too wonder when you think of these things, and may you be able to someday find the One that the Magi were seeking, and that I've been seeking to, the One who made the stars, and us, and came to save...

Vocalist/lyricist Byron Roberts, who came up with the idea for the band around 1989, took the name 'Bal-Sagoth' from a Robert E. Howard short story \"The Gods of Bal-Sagoth\". Their first demo was released in 1993; they have since released three albums on Cacophonous and three on Nuclear Blast.\n\n> The band incorporates black metal influences and symphonic elements into an overall grandiose canvas, with the elaborate lyrics of Byron Roberts painting a picture of battles in an antediluvian age where Atlantis had not yet been destroyed and the continents were still joined in a Pangaean mass. A predominant feature is the use of epic keyboards played by Jonny Maudling who composes and arranges the music. The guitar, drums and keyboards work together as an integral entity rather like a symphonic work. The vocals of Byron Roberts are a mixture of spoken word and black metal screams making the songs more like stories set to music than anything else. The stories are told like a play, with many characters (or groups of characters, speaking in unison) exchanging dialogue. Byron uses different vocalizations and effects to set them apart. The songs frequently have very long titles.

Vocalist/lyricist Byron Roberts, who came up with the idea for the band around 1989, took the name 'Bal-Sagoth' from a Robert E. Howard short story \"The Gods of Bal-Sagoth\". Their first demo was released in 1993; they have since released three albums on Cacophonous and three on Nuclear Blast.\n\n> The band incorporates black metal influences and symphonic elements into an overall grandiose canvas, with the elaborate lyrics of Byron Roberts painting a picture of battles in an antediluvian age where Atlantis had not yet been destroyed and the continents were still joined in a Pangaean mass. A predominant feature is the use of epic keyboards played by Jonny Maudling who composes and arranges the music. The guitar, drums and keyboards work together as an integral entity rather like a symphonic work. The vocals of Byron Roberts are a mixture of spoken word and black metal screams making the songs more like stories set to music than anything else. The stories are told like a play, with many characters (or groups of characters, speaking in unison) exchanging dialogue. Byron uses different vocalizations and effects to set them apart. The songs frequently have very long titles.

The band features Steve Miller on guitar and lead vocals, and is known for a string of (mainly) mid-1970s hit singles that continue to be staples of the classic rock radio format.\n\n> Steve Miller (born 5 October 1943) is a blues and rock and roll guitarist and performer. He was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin but attended high school in Dallas. While at St. Mark's School of Texas, he formed his first band, The Marksmen. Miller taught one of his classmates, Royce Boz Scaggs, a few guitar chords so that he could join the band; Scaggs became better known by his nickname, Boz. Miller attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison during the 1960s, where he formed The Ardells. Scaggs joined the Ardells the next year. Ben Sidran was added to the Ardells as a keyboardist the following year.\n\n> In 1968, Miller formed the Steve Miller Band, with Scaggs handling vocals, and released an album, Children of the Future, the first in a series of discs rooted solidly in the psychedelic blues style that dominated the San Francisco music scene at the time. Scaggs would leave the band after a couple of albums with vocal chores taken over by drummer Tim Davis; Miller himself would begin singing occasional lead on 1969's Brave New World. These albums performed respectably on the album charts but failed to yield a hit.\n\n> In the 1970's the band had some hits that became classics over the years - Jet Airliner, with some evocative lyrics that brought home the loss of life on the road; and The Joker which includes the famous line about the \"pompatus of love\", which is of course nonsense, but that didn't stop a lot of stoned folks from spending years talking amongst themselves.\n\n> Steve Miller's father was a wealthy doctor in Dallas, and friends with famous guitarist and guitar designer Les Paul.  Les Paul gave Miller his first guitar lessons.\n\n> Longtime member Norton Buffalo (harmonica player) died from lung cancer on October 30, 2009.\n\n> John King (drummer during \"The Joker\" era) died after a short bout of kidney cancer on October 26, 2010.\n\n> Band-member James Cooke died from cancer on 16 May 2011.
