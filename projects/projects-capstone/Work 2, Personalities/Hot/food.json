Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "dapzz8j"}, {"comment": "Have you never tried it?

Fold in the ends slightly.\n3. Add cinnamon butter to the top, turn the tube so the butter is on one side (not on top) and *gently* coil up into a spiral so the butter is on the inside.\n4. Put on a greased/oiled tray and add egg wash (some of the butter may leak and mix, doesn't matter) and then sprinkle with pearl sugar (which is how they do them in Sweden) instead of covering with icing.\n5.  Bake at around 220 C/425 F until the surface goes a strong golden brown, then maybe 5-10 mins longer just to make sure the inside is cooked through (you can test by sticking a needle in the dough and checking for residue). It takes quite a bit longer than the small cinnamon rolls.

Set up a breading station with two shallow dishes. In one dish, combine the beaten egg, whole milk, and hot sauce. In the other dish, combine the flour and salt.\nRemove the chicken from the pickle juice and dip into the egg-milk mixture first, then dip into the flour-salt mixture.\nPour 2-3 inches of oil into a large cast iron pot or pan and heat the oil to 350F degrees over medium-high heat. Fry each chicken breast for about 8 minutes on each side, or until internal temperature registers 165F degrees. After removing chicken from oil quickly dip into prepared hot sauce to get a nice coating on each side. Drain on a wire rack over a sheet pan.Whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. In a small bowl, mix together the egg, milk, and melted butter until well combined. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture and mix together just until the batter comes together. Fold the cheese, cooked bacon, and jalape\u00f1os into the batter.\nLightly grease the waffle iron, if needed, and cook per the iron's directions\n\nTo assemble this masterpiece place a waffle on a plate and add a portion of hot chicken. Is great adding a poached egg on top, which I overcooked mine so it wasn't pictured.  Can also garnish with dill pickles for more authentic style Hot Chicken.
