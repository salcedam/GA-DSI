So he signed the paperwork allowing the vet to put the dog down; although, the paperwork states that you are signing the pet over to the animal hospital.  So they took the dog and the asshole didn't even wait around to see the dog off so . . .they checked the dog out and it was in perfect health.  Now that the dog with signed off to them it was the vets property so they made some phone calls and found a home with one of my girlfriends coworkers family.  A couple weeks go by and the new owners say this dog is the greatest dogs they ever owned.  The new owners said that the dog was clearly beaten because when it did get into trouble with its new owners it acted like it expected to be beaten.  Oh and the fuck wad that gave the dog up came in to the vet a few weeks later with a huge tube of dogfood and wanted to get a refund for it! As a fuck you the vet told the guy they found a home for the dog so he then wanted a refund for the euthanasia but the great part is in the contract he signed stated that the dog is now the property of the vet and the money would go towards the euthanasia **OR** finding the animal a new home.

She routinely visited a free support group downtown that offered one-on-one and group councelling for all these things.  Bullying, suicide, emotional support.  The group would also plan group outings so they could all hang out together and do things together.  You could even invite your straight friends to come hang out/support you.  That's what Jamie needed.  People even found partners at this group.  He could have found that boyfriend!  \n\nI have depression and anxiety and Jamie's blog mirrorred my own thoughts when outside influences of my life were causing me so much mental pain, I actually did want to end things.  It actually felt like physical pain.  It's unbearable.  To me, thoughts of suicide felt akin to someone with chronic physical pain choosing to die, rather than to live with pain. \n\nThe ONLY thing that took away this pain was SUPPORT.  I went to see councillors and psychologists, just like Jamie.  It does feel better to talk to someone about your problems, but the psychologists and councillors cannot FIX your problems.\n\nI am an adult, so I can find out where I need to go and figure out what I have to do to get the support I need.  I have complete control over my life.  If someone harasses me at work, I have control over getting that person to stop.  In highschool, nobody gives a shit.  You're just supposed to take it.  One person can only take so much, before their mind gives up on trying to pull through.\n\nJamie was still in highschool.  He's not fully an adult yet.  He still needs guidance on how to seek help that he needs.  The only help described in the article was medication and psychotherapy.  Jamie needed a support group.  He needed a place where he could feel like he belonged and where he would be accepted.  Did his parents find this for him or help him find his way to that place?  \n\nIf medication and psychotherapy aren't working and the problem is getting worse, common sense dictates you have to try something else.  Did they?\n\nDepression also manifests from internal and external causes.  People who have depression because of an internal problem, usually have to be on medication for the rest of their lives.  However, there are people who are depressed because of external influences.  These people may NEVER need medication.  I am hoping that Jamie's doctor knew what he was prescribing, because there definitely seems to be more than sufficient evidence to indicate that his depression may have been from external influences.  The way to solve that is to change your environment and eliminate the negative external influences.

It was much like Shenmue II.\n\u25a0We went to the nearest city and took a carriage to a city that was further away. It could take us to any of the game\u2019s cities \u2013 even the ones we hadn\u2019t been to.  \n\u25a0We heard people shout for help in the wilderness in a fashion not dissimilar to Red Dead Redemption, except instead of needing to be defended from outlaws, they\u2019re running from dire wolves or Orcs. Or dragons. \n\u25a0We stared in awe at the mist around mountains. It looks phenomenal. \n\n\u25a0We went into someone\u2019s house and were asked politely to leave. Then firmly.

He'd seen us too. Run!\n\u25a0We spent 20 minutes riding from one spot on the map to another. Skyrim is freakin' humongous, and much of it in wide-open areas populated by mammoths and giants. \n\u25a0We learned the difference between riding on the road with a horse (they can gallop at full-speed) and riding in the hills on a horse (they can only trot, never building speed). \n\u25a0We fell off a cliff with our horse several times. Most of the times it killed us, but once we saw our character slowly climb to his feet and continue after a particularly unfortunate fall.\n\u25a0We were amazed as we rode through shallow water with a horse. Water ripples are brilliantly rendered in real time, and look straight out of a Pixar movie.\n\u25a0We had the horse shot out from under us.

Snowberries and Silverside Perch resist frost; Dragon's Tongue and Strawberries both resist fire; Deathbell and Bleeding Crown both contain weakness to poison. When we mixed Snowberries, Silverside Perch, and Dragon's Tongue we created a Potion of Resist Frost. \n\u25a0We also tried to improve our weapons using Grindstones, but we didn\u2019t have any of the ingredients.\n\u25a0We swung our axe at the Grindstone in frustration \u2013 it bounced off. \n\u25a0We tried to talk to a Ghostly Headless Horsemen, but he wouldn\u2019t have a conversation with us despite having a \u201ctalk' prompt.\u201d Presumably, because he doesn\u2019t have a mouth. That, or he\u2019s a rude bastard.\n\u25a0We mistakenly alerted guards as we tried to sneak up on them by bumping into bones dangling from ropes on the ceiling. They made a clattery noise and we jumped. \n\u25a0We passed a stone column with a sword, shield, and flowers laid at its base. We left them well alone.\n\u25a0We enjoyed talking to NPCs without time freezing around us. Talking to people is a much more organic process, happening in real-time.\n\u25a0We reloaded a previous save because an NPC wouldn\u2019t progress the quest.

Or there was an enemy stuck in it. \n\n\u25a0We hit a guard in the head with a mace and got thrown in jail.\n\u25a0We tried to pick the lock in our jail cell but failed, breaking the one lockpick we snuck in.\n\u25a0We broke out of our cell by smashing through a crumbing wall, and then took back our stuff and fought our way out .\n\u25a0We saw some giants standing around and went to talk to them. They didn\u2019t want to talk to us. Way to perpetuate the stereotypes, guys.\n\u25a0We drank a potion and entered into an NPC\u2019s memories.\n\u25a0We talked to a salty sea captain who lost his sea salt in a sea cave. \n\u25a0We overheard a conversation about women in a town having horrid nightmares, and were given a side-quest to help end them.\n\u25a0We randomly attacked a ship\u2019s captain, hoping the crew would join in our coup.\n\u25a0We weren\u2019t all that surprise when the crew didn\u2019t join in our coup. \n\u25a0We jumped off the boat into the water, and swam away from out failed coup. \n\u25a0We walked in snow so thick we could barely see where we were going.\n\u25a0We read the letters in our inventory, which are 3D and unfold as you select them, revealing their written contents realistically written on the paper, not just as screen text. \n\u25a0We had some epic battles thanks to the new combat. Holding down the attack button does a charge attack in both senses of the word. Not only will the blow be more forceful, our Argonian also ran forward several steps before delivering the attack. \n\u25a0We missed several powerful swings of our weapon. The lunge is easy to miss, though if it was too easy, the move would likely be overpowered. If you do hit, however, it knocks the hell out of them. \n\n\u25a0We saw a fox while we were running through the forest. Quickly, we turned to it and used our magical ability to light it on fire. We actually laughed out loud and said \u201cHeh, Firefox.\u201d\n\u25a0We leveled up and spent our skill to improve our magical abilities. It turned our small flame attack into a full-blown flamethrower. \n\u25a0We swung a mace at a wolf and hit it so hard it rolled down the side of a hill for nearly a minute. It was a big hill.\n\u25a0We were randomly attacked by a woman while passing a village, but the only reason we noticed it was because we heard a \u201ctwang\u201d and saw an arrow fall to the ground after striking a rock.\n\u25a0We overheard people talking about a recent attack, though they didn\u2019t go into details. \n\u25a0We found a cave in the middle of nowhere filled with traps.\n\u25a0We tried to explore the cave, but were killed by the traps.\n\u25a0We tried to explore the cave again, but were killed by zombies after being weakened by the traps.\n\u25a0We decided that the cave sucked and was for losers and didn\u2019t go back.\n\u25a0We went to the cave again and cleared it, earning awesome new items and gaining a ton of experience.\n\u25a0We walked into a city we saw an executioner preparing to bring an axe down on a man\u2019s neck.

Which of you wouldn\u2019t consider it the highlight of his reddit career just to associate with them for even one day? Sure, I\u2019m lucky. Who wouldn\u2019t consider it an honor to have known the 'Fuck Sears' post? Also, the creators of animation's greatest empire, Pixar showing Up to a dieing 10 year old girl? To have spent five years with that wonderful little fellow, Snoo? Then to have spent the next five years with outstanding leaders, that smart student of psychology, the best admins in Reddit today, hueypriest, spladugalienth, chromakode, bsimpson, intortus and kemitche? Sure, I'm lucky.  \n  \nWhen Digg, a website you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift \u2014 that\u2019s something. When everybody down to the mods and those boys in white coats remember you with karma\u2014 that\u2019s something. When you have a wonderful mod who takes sides with you in squabbles against their own subreddit\u2014 that's something. When you have a community who works so that you can have an education and build a body\u2014 it's a blessing. When you have a subreddit who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed \u2014 that's the finest I know.  \n  \nSo I close in saying that we might have been given a bad break, but we've got an awful lot to live for.

Which of you wouldn\u2019t consider it the highlight of his reddit career just to associate with them for even one day? Sure, I\u2019m lucky. Who wouldn\u2019t consider it an honor to have known the 'Fuck Sears' post? Also, the creators of animation's greatest empire, Pixar showing Up to a dieing 10 year old girl? To have spent five years with that wonderful little fellow, Snoo? Then to have spent the next five years with outstanding leaders, that smart student of psychology, the best admins in Reddit today, hueypriest, spladugalienth, chromakode, bsimpson, intortus and kemitche? Sure, I'm lucky.  \n  \nWhen Digg, a website you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift \u2014 that\u2019s something. When everybody down to the mods and those boys in white coats remember you with karma\u2014 that\u2019s something. When you have a wonderful mod who takes sides with you in squabbles against their own subreddit\u2014 that's something. When you have a community who works so that you can have an education and build a body\u2014 it's a blessing. When you have a subreddit who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed \u2014 that's the finest I know.  \n  \nSo I close in saying that we might have been given a bad break, but we've got an awful lot to live for.

It will still happen, it will just take a bit longer, maybe sooner than you think. All this accomplished is to dig the hole deeper so we fall even harder when it happens. \n\nThe banks are right back to their evil ways, speculating on derivatives to the tune of about $70 Trillion right now. Nothing has been done to prevent them from destroying the economy again and they will accomplish just that. They are gamblers, they gamble money they don't have and our money. When they win, they get to keep their ill gotten gains. When they lose they expect us to pickup their tab. There is no incentive not to gamble with the deck stacked like that. There are no consequences if they lose. There are tremendous rewards if they win. All you have to do is share a little of your winnings with a few choice Congressmen and Senators and you are in like Flint, the game must go on. Sure beats working at McDicks. \n\nI say let it all collapse now. We will pick up the pieces and this is the only way to wake up the sheeple. A good disaster seems to bring out the best in people. We will survive and the system will change through necessity. Our current Congress has outlived its usefulness. "], [130, "Most importantly, we'll never know.\n\nFrom what I gather, the usual expectation is that it would have been worse in the short run (definitely a depression), but better in the long run (since no shoddy banks would have survived).\n"], [107, "Yeah, the banks fucked up. However, if the banks had not been \"bailed out,\" credit would remain frozen. If banks don't lend to one another, they cannot raise any additional capital. If they don't raise additional capital, they cannot meet the obligations of the money that they possess on liability (i.e, your savings and checking.) No bank actually has the cash on hand to liquidate all their accounts. This is why bank runs are so dangerous.\n\nIf a bank were liquidated extremely fast as happened in the bank runs in the Great Depression, the FDIC would still have to attempt to compensate for the money that the bank can't supply, and the government would essentially bail out a few investors, but by then the system already has a wrench in its gears.\n\nInstead, the \"bailout\" loans (it wasn't just a donation) were used to maintain the spread, and even made a profit for many banks. In the end, I believe the loans have mostly been repaid.\n\nIn a word, no. We'd all be fucked."], [86, "Everytime someone says Sheeple a baby is blended alive."], [34, "No, they had to be saved. After they were saved they should have been broken up and their directors, executives and major stock holders tried and jailed.\n\nInstead they did not even have to suffer the return of the regulations which had kept them from behaving in totally criminal ways.\n\n"], [28, "They should have let the banks fail to discourage future wrong-doing. All we did was encourage their dishonest behavior."], [25, "Errrr... You can't let banks fail on a large scale. That is, if you like groceries in the stores and your neighbor not killing you for your supplies."], [20, "I think the idea of a reset is far more romantic than the reality.  People don't realize how bad things would have gotten.  We were very close to being in a situation where you would have gone to the store and there literally was no food.  Payrolls would have stopped.  I'd like to think rational minds would have worked through it, but you never know.  If we heal the wound under the band aid, it is better, but if we allow the status quo to remain, then yea it was probably worse to delay.  People love to talk on here about hedging your risk with gold.  You'd be a lot better off with bullets and food.  Because when it goes that bad, no one is going to ask if you want to trade your gold for food.  If you have what they want, they will take it."], [20, "Have you ever heard of a bread line? No probably not since you are actually asking this questions.\n\nThe entire economy, that is everything you buy, do, drive, ride, eat, sleep in, protect yourself with, all it is based on credit. Grocery stores use short term credit to shelve their stores, where you get your food. If the banks had been let to collapse, all of that would have been destroyed and just about every business in the country, and shortly after, the world would shut down. There would be massive riots as people in cities starved to death. There would be wide spread crime as the police stations shut down, and likely martial law through out the world.\n\nThe banks didn't ask for a bail out, the bail outs were **FORCED** upon the banks because Treasury and the Fed knew just how bad things would get. And don't forget that they did let one bank fail, Lehman Brothers, and it almost lead to the senario described above.  And when I say almost, I mean we were days away.  Days away from what can really only be compared to complete collapse of society.\n\nDo yourself a favor and read *Too Big to Fail*, or at least go watch the HBO movie of it."], [17, "Without a bailout millions of people would have lost their retirements.

Any time the government gets involved, it forcibly takes money from one part of the economy (businesses, markets, etc.) and gives it to another.  What about the banks that didn't get bailed out?  They were squashed in favor of the big banks.  Maybe they could have risen to the top as an ethical, sane alternative to BoA and friends.  The market is resilient, but not when it is fucked with.\n\nThe big banks will forever be bailed out or will fail harder because they were bailed out.  With the current economic situation and the people waking up, I go with the latter."], [6, "Well, wait a sec, the FDIC isn't a general fund for money the bank can't supply.  It insures depositors accounts, up to $100,000, in case the bank does fail.  The larger money supply is maintained by the Federal Reserve (I think).\n\nA bad thing about bailing out the banks is that this action renders the whole moral hazard idea null.  In otherwords, if the banks F-up through their own actions, and some other entity bails 'em out, there's no sense that doing something wrong or stupid carries any consequences.  With the bailout, the government socialized the losses by taking on bank debt and privatizes profit.  Banks get to operate in a consequence free environment as a result.

Google \"Austrian Economics\".\n\nThe scholars in this field have been advocating letting the banks fail since day 1.

When they start thinking that Uncle Sam will have their back and bail them out then they make increasingly risky decisions, which can lead to high profits, but also devastating losses. Had those banks been allowed to fail no doubt we would all be hurting right now, probably in a slightly worse recession, but it would have benefited society in the long run because the thought of failure curbs the risky behavior of the people."], [4, "It would be better to let them fall, I mean look at Iceland, three of their top banks went under a couple years ago and now they are coming back economically.

If you are too big to fail then you are too big to exist. So no, it would not have been better to let the banks fail but they sure as hell should not have received that type of bail out. It's absurd to socialize the loses but privatize the earnings."], [5, "Your question is ambiguous about what exactly is meant by \"letting the banks fail,\" because you don't specify if you mean *liquidation* or *reorganization*.  These are two forms of bankruptcy: in a liquidation, the business ceases to exist, all of its assets are sold off, and its employees are out of a job, whereas in a reorganization, its stockholders are wiped out, the creditors become the new owners, and the business keeps ticking under new management.\n\nWhen it comes to the bank bailouts, there are four parties involved:\n\n* The financial businesses.  By this I mean primarily the corporations, their directors, management, employees and assets.\n* The stockholders of the financial businesses.\n* The government, who provides money for the rescues.\n* The taxpayers, who finance the government; you could see them as the government's \"shareholders.\"\n\nThe bailout that we've had is, basically, the government stepping in to rescue the financial businesses **and their stockholders** at the taxpayers' expense.  But the big problem here isn't the rescue of the businesses\u2014which is probably justified in order to help the economy\u2014but rather the rescue of the stockholders, who should have been wiped out for investing in a business that failed.  Rescuing the stockholders is letting them keep the rewards but put the risk on taxpayers.\n\nSo if by \"let the banks fail\" you mean let the **businesses** close down (i.e., liquidate), the answer is no, it would have been a lot worse if we'd let them fail.  If you mean reorganize them, then hell yeah, that would have been better.  The government would put up the money for keeping them afloat\u2014but then the government ends up as the owner, and sells the recovered businesses back in the market when the economy recovers."], [4, "You met me at a very strange time in my life."], [4, "There is nothing more possibly terrible and wrong than to go about the path we are now, and have been since the earlier days of England. The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel. We always hear about money going to foreign banks (specifically, around 80% of bail out money went to foreign banks). Who are these banks? Are they run by a sovereign nation? No. Are they run by a private corporation/families? Yes. \n\nThere is a reason no one on the media or anywhere for that matter are allowed to speak about WHO owns these foreign banks. The reason is because all Western media sources and many others through trickle-down-effect of reprinting the same story, are owned by these Foreign banking elite. The Rothschilds are the number one family in the world, estimated to be worth upwards of 500 trillion dollars. They downplay their wealth because people tend to get more educated, and true history will show that this is the case. The Federal Reserve is a Rothschild central bank modeled after the Central Bank of England, a private 'crown' corporation, who's shareholders are these private families. They are Ashkenazi Jews, very smart people. It's no wonder they are ahead of the masses in terms of control through things like the media. However, the internet is changing it all. Awareness is being spread around. People are starting to figure out what the Federal Reserve actually does. \n\nWhen you understand the implications of the Fed, it relates to everything else, including the power of corporations. The founding fathers knew about this power. They wanted the power of banking in the hands of the people, for once. This is why they are so respected. Andrew Jackson's entire presidency was to kill the private bank. They caused economic disasters and blamed it on Jackson. The people didn't know any better, and they really still don't for the most part.\n\n\"We have, in this country, one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board. This evil institution has impoverished the people of the United States and has practically bankrupted our government. It has done this through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it\". \u2014 Congressman Louis T. McFadden in 1932 (Rep. Pa)\n\nIf you let the banks fail, yes it will be problematic and manifest other problems that otherwise wouldn't exist. But it is a drastic moment for drastic change. It will be counterbalanced by the benefits of removing these useless corporate entities from power. Too big to fail? Too big to exist. \n\nSo what's the solution of the Fed. These are things to consider:\n\nShould the power of the control of a nation's currency belong to the people/Congress or should private currencies compete? The problem with the latter, is that these 'money changers' as they've been known as throughout history, corner markets with their established wealth, and drive prices up to as high as the market can bare.\n\nMy thoughts is that it should belong to the people/Congress. Support and promote transparency in government. Remove the Fed, expose the 'Foreign Banks/Rothschilds' cartel, educate and aware the people for a change, and perhaps Congress will have more faith from the people and it will work in this unprecedented age of technology and transparency.\n\n   \"Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.\" \u2014 James A. Garfield, President of the United States\n\nHistory repeats itself. The Rothschild aka \"Foreign Banking\" cartel has existed since the wars of France and England, with whom the Rothschilds backed England and helped defeat France. They made their wealth from loaning to governments since they were better investments to be backed by the tax payers. This system has gone no where. To this day, you will see documentaries and works around the world wide library about how almost all nations on Earth are subject to this debt-money scam. \n\n\u201cMoney is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal \u2013 that there is no human relation between master and slave.\u201d Leo Tolstoy, Russian writer.\n\nAnd you may wonder, if this is true why haven't the Rothschild's been exposed? Well besides hiding their wealth behind proxies, they also set up an entity called the Anti-Defamation League, which basically seeks to harass anyone who commits defamation or slander against Jews. This was created conveniently and coincidentally the same year the Rothschild's/foreign bankers set up the 'Federal' Reserve, in 1913. \n\nTherefore, anyone who attempts to relate global banking conspiracy/NWO/world government to Zionism or the Rothschilds than they are automatically attacked by the ADL and basically forced to keep quiet. \n\nA good introduction to the Federal Reserve is G. Edward Griffin's 'Creature from Jekyll Island: A 2nd look at the Federal Reserve. Also, 'Money Masters', 'The American Dream', talks about the Fed by Louis McFadden, JFK, the founding fathers (called it Central Banks), Milton Friedman, Ron Paul, etc. All great starting areas. \n\nAlso Central Banking isn't necessarily bad, but fractional reserve banking allows banks to create money continuously and make profits of it's interest, meanwhile attributing to serious inflation. \n\nIf there is a God, I hope it helps us all. World poverty would end in a year if the Rothschild/Foreign Banking system is exposed and ridiculous national debt owed to private families abolished.\n\nLet African nations print and issue and control their own currency. Let Canada. Let America. Let Europe. \n\nWho doesn't have a Rothschild bank? \n-Iran (stuxnet virus to shut down nuclear plants, enemy in media)\n-Afghanistan (failed state, NATO occupied)\n-Sudan (failed state)\n-Cuba (enemy in media, operation northwoods conspiracy)\n-Libya (a central bank has been set up by the rebels according to Western media.

That much is pretty clear.  \n\nTo the average person, including yours truly, \"bank\" is a catch-all term for institutions dealing in money, whether insurance giants, lending institutions, or banks that only offer deposit accounts.  Fact is most of us don't have time to learn the details of real hard economics, as it is an incredibly complicated discipline, and it would take full time learning over the course of years to really come to grips with its idiosyncracies.\n\nThere's an opposite tendency I notice, whereby experts become (for lack of a better word) desensitized to the bigger picture, or the dangers of things.  I found this in myself when I was taking my chemistry & biochemistry training - as I learned more about things like arsenate, ethidium bromide, pyridine, hydrofluoric acid, cyanide, etc, including working with them in the lab and learning about them in theory, I became desensitized to them - felt as though by virtue of my knowledge I had somehow conquered them.  They remained just as dangerous for my health, but somehow my expert knowledge changed my perception of them.  I feel like a similar phenomenon is at play when economics students rattle off technical jargon about financial instruments in political discussions.\n\n", "id": "c2sr3oi"}, {"comment": "I've been trying to put this in words for quite some time.\n\nExcellent post.\n\nThank you.", "id": "c2sram0"}, {"comment": "Huh?

Wish I could upvote you more than once.\n\nIt is plainly obvious that bailing out the banks or \"too big to fail\" creates a HUGE [moral hazard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard) and will only serve to make the rest of us poorer, and the rich richer.  The big banks are enjoying privatized profits and socialized losses to a massive degree.\n\nLetting the banks collapse is the ONLY way correct the massive imbalance, and fix our economy in the long run.  But thanks to our politics of high spending and high debt, that would now create astronomical problems for our economy.  Bank failure would cause credit to freeze, and the resulting deflation would be catastrophic for servicing the public debt.  \n\nThe only two options at that point.  One is outright default, which would send the globe into total and utter chaos.  It would force our government to balance its budget (because lending would halt completely), which would cause a deep depression, which further reduces government revenue.  The ensuing depression will be far worse than the Great Depression.  There will be LOTS of pain.  Good thing is, it would clear out almost ALL the malinvestments that have been built up over decades.  Those people who do have savings & capital will be able to invest in a VERY favorable environment where labor & commodities are dirt cheap.  Companies may actually start to manufacture in the US again.  The economy will quickly rebuild on very solid foundation.\n\nThe other option would be where Bernanke fights the deflation with money printing.  The Fed will start QE3, QE4, QEx and ensure the government will not technically default.  However this will cause massive price inflation which will torpedo the economy.  The failing economy would further reduce government revenue and force even more money printing.  Then we enter a hyperinflationary depression that completely destroys the currency, the economy, and possibly the government.  This happens over several years all while Bernanke and the politicians are trying to \"fix\" it.  The rich people, of course see it coming and they are already well positioned in hard assets.   \n\nThis is why the governments are fighting so desperately to save the banks and to prop up Greece, no matter what moral cost they incur by pushing bad debt onto the public.", "id": "c2sr56b"}, {"comment": "This is what 30 years of deregulating financial institutions gives you.

So our GDP looks *okay*, but wealth inequality has actually gotten *worse*, which is worse for society in both the short term and the long term.\n\n>the \"bailout\" loans (it wasn't just a donation)\n\nI'm really tired of hearing people talk about how TARP was a loan and not a grant as though this ends the conversation.  Yes, it was a loan.  But it wasn't just any old loan.  It was a loan on more favorable terms than **any person or even any bank would have gotten from any other creditor in the world even under the best of circumstances**.  Like, you know how if you have a so-so credit rating, and you apply for a loan or a line of credit, how the bank will give you less than you might have asked for (if it gives you anything at all), and it will charge you a huge chunk of interest?  Like, these days, something around 20% APR or more?  The failing banks are like a would-be debtor with so-so credit, except that instead of getting only a tiny loan with shitty repayment terms, they got massively huge loans (and ask any financial analyst: those loans were *not* secured by proportionately valuable assets -- remember all the talk a few years back about toxic assets?  THOSE were the assets securing trillions in debt.  It was like getting a $500k mortgage secured by a crumbling, rotting shed sitting out on a swamp.  It's something NO HUMAN PERSON WOULD EVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS EVER GET FROM ANY CREDITOR) with some of the most favorable loan repayment terms known to mankind.\n\nTHAT'S why people call it a bailout.  Because it was a **FUCKING BAILOUT**.  There is no way that those kinds of loans were financially justified under any kind of standard credit rating decision.  They were as close to gifts as a loan can be without being a flat-out handout.  They were \"loans\" the way it's a \"loan\" if your parents pay for your college and tell you you're supposed to pay it back someday, without interest, if and when you get a job.  Yes, technically, it got paid back, as back in the day when college graduates could get jobs they often managed to pay back their folks for helping with school.  But that hardly means it was a \"loan\" in any meaningful sense that is true to the term \"loan\" as it is used in standard finance.\n\n/soapbox", "id": "c2srier"}, {"comment": "Bingo", "id": "c2srulk"}, {"comment": "I thought credit was still pretty much frozen no matter how much money they throw into the system with quantative easing", "id": "c2sqmxv"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "c2sqv46"}, {"comment": "I heard the banks weren't particularly willing to lend at the moment", "id": "c2sqwtq"}, {"comment": "bank runs are dangerous, but what if we (the 99%) \"slowly\" stopped using banks?

These are two forms of bankruptcy: in a liquidation, the business ceases to exist, all of its assets are sold off, and its employees are out of a job, whereas in a reorganization, its stockholders are wiped out, the creditors become the new owners, and the business keeps ticking under new management.\n\nWhen it comes to the bank bailouts, there are four parties involved:\n\n* The financial businesses.  By this I mean primarily the corporations, their directors, management, employees and assets.\n* The stockholders of the financial businesses.\n* The government, who provides money for the rescues.\n* The taxpayers, who finance the government; you could see them as the government's \"shareholders.\"\n\nThe bailout that we've had is, basically, the government stepping in to rescue the financial businesses **and their stockholders** at the taxpayers' expense.  But the big problem here isn't the rescue of the businesses\u2014which is probably justified in order to help the economy\u2014but rather the rescue of the stockholders, who should have been wiped out for investing in a business that failed.  Rescuing the stockholders is letting them keep the rewards but put the risk on taxpayers.\n\nSo if by \"let the banks fail\" you mean let the **businesses** close down (i.e., liquidate), the answer is no, it would have been a lot worse if we'd let them fail.

The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel. We always hear about money going to foreign banks (specifically, around 80% of bail out money went to foreign banks). Who are these banks? Are they run by a sovereign nation? No. Are they run by a private corporation/families? Yes. \n\nThere is a reason no one on the media or anywhere for that matter are allowed to speak about WHO owns these foreign banks. The reason is because all Western media sources and many others through trickle-down-effect of reprinting the same story, are owned by these Foreign banking elite. The Rothschilds are the number one family in the world, estimated to be worth upwards of 500 trillion dollars. They downplay their wealth because people tend to get more educated, and true history will show that this is the case. The Federal Reserve is a Rothschild central bank modeled after the Central Bank of England, a private 'crown' corporation, who's shareholders are these private families. They are Ashkenazi Jews, very smart people. It's no wonder they are ahead of the masses in terms of control through things like the media. However, the internet is changing it all. Awareness is being spread around. People are starting to figure out what the Federal Reserve actually does. \n\nWhen you understand the implications of the Fed, it relates to everything else, including the power of corporations. The founding fathers knew about this power. They wanted the power of banking in the hands of the people, for once. This is why they are so respected. Andrew Jackson's entire presidency was to kill the private bank. They caused economic disasters and blamed it on Jackson. The people didn't know any better, and they really still don't for the most part.\n\n\"We have, in this country, one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board. This evil institution has impoverished the people of the United States and has practically bankrupted our government. It has done this through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it\". \u2014 Congressman Louis T. McFadden in 1932 (Rep. Pa)\n\nIf you let the banks fail, yes it will be problematic and manifest other problems that otherwise wouldn't exist. But it is a drastic moment for drastic change. It will be counterbalanced by the benefits of removing these useless corporate entities from power. Too big to fail? Too big to exist. \n\nSo what's the solution of the Fed. These are things to consider:\n\nShould the power of the control of a nation's currency belong to the people/Congress or should private currencies compete? The problem with the latter, is that these 'money changers' as they've been known as throughout history, corner markets with their established wealth, and drive prices up to as high as the market can bare.\n\nMy thoughts is that it should belong to the people/Congress. Support and promote transparency in government. Remove the Fed, expose the 'Foreign Banks/Rothschilds' cartel, educate and aware the people for a change, and perhaps Congress will have more faith from the people and it will work in this unprecedented age of technology and transparency.\n\n   \"Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.\" \u2014 James A. Garfield, President of the United States\n\nHistory repeats itself. The Rothschild aka \"Foreign Banking\" cartel has existed since the wars of France and England, with whom the Rothschilds backed England and helped defeat France. They made their wealth from loaning to governments since they were better investments to be backed by the tax payers. This system has gone no where. To this day, you will see documentaries and works around the world wide library about how almost all nations on Earth are subject to this debt-money scam. \n\n\u201cMoney is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal \u2013 that there is no human relation between master and slave.\u201d Leo Tolstoy, Russian writer.\n\nAnd you may wonder, if this is true why haven't the Rothschild's been exposed? Well besides hiding their wealth behind proxies, they also set up an entity called the Anti-Defamation League, which basically seeks to harass anyone who commits defamation or slander against Jews. This was created conveniently and coincidentally the same year the Rothschild's/foreign bankers set up the 'Federal' Reserve, in 1913. \n\nTherefore, anyone who attempts to relate global banking conspiracy/NWO/world government to Zionism or the Rothschilds than they are automatically attacked by the ADL and basically forced to keep quiet. \n\nA good introduction to the Federal Reserve is G. Edward Griffin's 'Creature from Jekyll Island: A 2nd look at the Federal Reserve. Also, 'Money Masters', 'The American Dream', talks about the Fed by Louis McFadden, JFK, the founding fathers (called it Central Banks), Milton Friedman, Ron Paul, etc. All great starting areas. \n\nAlso Central Banking isn't necessarily bad, but fractional reserve banking allows banks to create money continuously and make profits of it's interest, meanwhile attributing to serious inflation. \n\nIf there is a God, I hope it helps us all. World poverty would end in a year if the Rothschild/Foreign Banking system is exposed and ridiculous national debt owed to private families abolished.\n\nLet African nations print and issue and control their own currency. Let Canada. Let America.

Or it could have been beneficial...but I doubt it, as inertia is a bitch; the stronger it is, the more effort it takes to stop, start, or redirect it.\n\nAs far as doing it all over again goes, I'm not happy about some of the things that happened, not by a long shot...but we're in a position now where things can still be fixed, rather than potentially having nothing left to do but sift through the rubble.\n\nOn a broader thought...\nOur financial system is rotten to the core.  Replacing already-festered parts with parts ripe to begin festering won't fix anything, it just means that some time passes and the non-corrupted become corrupted and the cycle persists.\n\nFor a beautiful case study in this, look at DC.  No matter how many fresh bodies we send, we're doing nothing but treat the symptoms of a greater underlying disease.  And contrary to some of the nutters out there, burning it all to the ground (and then doing nothing, expecting magic to take care of it, or intentionally building a randian dystopia from the ashes, depending on who you ask) isn't the solution.\n\nWe don't torch our houses and then build a new one when the roof leaks.  We don't replace our cars when a tire goes flat.  We don't rip out every traffic signal and sign in town when some drunken yahoo gets in a wreck, and we didn't dismantle the internet because somebody created a virus.  We fix the problems.  So why is government any different?\n\nIt's not.\n\nIf the republic is to survive, if society is to heal, we've got a lot of work to do.  Separate money from politics...when dollars are votes, we slide towards plutocracy, and plutocracy has a track record of collapsing 100% of the time.  It is however a nasty chicken-and-egg scenario...those able to do the repairs are also at the heart of the problem, and most are unwilling to sacrifice their careers and put a strong, stable society first.  When some entities are more equal than others, we get corruption.  Return logic, reason, and pragmatism to the world of business...as long as business leaders are expected to gamble with the company's future, the gambling will continue.\n\nFinancially, we've condoned excessive risk.  By privatizing the profits and socializing the losses, we encourage economic gambling...bet the farm all the time because there's no repercussions (as long as your company's big enough to have 'friends' in congress).  Rather than focusing on and rewarding steady, sustainable operation we've sold investors on the idea of the ever-increasing return.  Log ago have logic and reason been abandoned in favor of clinging to the idea that prices [in this case, price per share] will only ever go up and only ever accelerate in its rate of climb.\n\nSound familiar?  It should.  It's the same thing that got us into the housing debacle.  'If you ever can't pay your loan, just sell the house and turn a profit!  You've got nothing to fear!  Prices will never decrease!'\n\nWithout well-regulated markets [in quality of regulation, meaningfulness of penalties, and even-handedness of enforcement], our economy will remain unstable.  So long as real wages remain stagnant, the foundation of our economy will continue to erode, and eventually it'll come toppling down anyway when the discretionary dollar is right up there with Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy as figments of the imagination.\n\nAnd so long as money and politics are allowed to intermingle, we'll have the best government money can buy...a plutocracy, a nation where fitness to lead (and in a dystopian version, even availability of basic rights) is determined by net worth.  So long as money and politics are allowed to intermingle, the attitude will remain 'to hell with the dirty peasants...if they didn't want to be treated like peasants, they shouldn't have been born peasants!'\n\nThe ballot box has failed us, America.  It's time to use the soap box.  And God help us if that doesn't work...the old saying might be wrong about the order [soap-ballot-ammo, when time and time again we see ballot-soap-ammo], the final box is always the same...and it never gets opened without horrific levels of violence, bloodshed, and loss of life following in its wake.

The overwhelming majority of people who start off poor and end up rich do it by starting small businesses. They aren't investing in the stock market at all early on, they're investing in business cards and brooms at first. Eventually they work up to investing in hiring other people to work for them. Later on they start investing in for retirement, or as a business, but that's not generally until much later on.\n\nWhere the governments involvement starts to hurt is in stability. With all the random bailouts and bank takeovers, the economic climate is very unstable. It's much harder to hire an employee, buy new equipment, and spend money to advertise when things are shifting by the month. Businesses need to plan years in advance, and government meddling makes that a much more imprecise calculation.\n\nThe second second issue is lending. There are a lot of ways that creative people find to raise money or otherwise avoid borrowing it, but in a bad economy, lenders are wary, so finding start-up funding is much tougher, and some types of businesses are much, much easier to start with investor buy in.\n\nThe third and arguably the largest issue is regulation and red tape. Bernie Marcus, founder of Home Depot, has said there is no way he could do what he did with the current level of government bureaucracy to slog through.

I was already suspicious that something might be going on bc on her wall these guys are popping in saying stuff like what you doing tonite or you free on Saturday or we should go out for a drink sometime. And it was some what obvious bc she added these guys as friends through some app on FB called like hot or not or something like that. So I got curious on why she is pm'ing these dudes, clicked in one. This guy had asked why are you on that app if you have a bf, aren't you afraid you are going to hurt him if he found out. She responded with \"he'll get over it\". That statement was embedded in my mind and caused a lot of grief. This happened about 6 months in to the relationship. At that time she have a daughter that was about 2 years old and she was living with her mom. She didn't make much money and could barely scrape by. I was the guy who paid for everything when we do go out. One night I was actually hanging out with her daughter and her. While she walked away to do laundry she got a text, from the guy on FB. Basically said what are you doing blah blah blah. I was kinda pissed bc she told me she had stopped talking to him. And we took a break for a couple days, then i have in amd said lets get back together. 5 months after we get back together It really hit rock bottom when we got in to a fight and I found out she had kissed some other dude at the bar. Basically there was this guy who was really in to her ever since when she was in high school. Keep in mind I never cared that they hung out bc she told me to trust her and she has absolutely no attraction to that guy. We got in to a fight. Didn't talk to her for like 2 days. Finally get a text from her, she said she is hanging out with that guy. I said ok whatever, then the next day she calls me and tells me they kissed and she is really sorry. Through those incidents and the amount stress it had put on my body and my mind, I developed hyperthyroidism.

That's not to say that just joining a Credit Union and ditching a commercial bank will solve the problems that large commercial banking firms cause (what with speculative investing and all) but to even compare a Credit Union to a Bank in terms of them being evil and money grubbing is ignorant at best, and plain idiotic at worst.\n\nI suppose some of the very basic, important differences should be noted:\n\nCredit Unions are not-for-profit organizations.  They exist solely to provide services to their members. For just about all Credit Unions, Member Service is the NUMBER ONE GOAL.  You could essentially call any person with a single dollar held at a Credit Union a \"Shareholder\".\n\nBanks are for-profit, with their only allegiance being to shareholders. All actions are expected to show a profit.  You are not number 1 in the Bank's eyes. You're probably not even number 10.  Decisions are all made by highly paid executives, influenced by wealthy investors (other corporations) with the customer's interest rarely taken into account.\n\nJust that comparison there should be enough to clue anyone in as to why a Credit Union should be your first choice.  Look at Bank of America and their $5 dollar debit card fee.  In the Credit Union world, an idea like that would be absolute lunacy.  Fees and income from a Credit Union essentially get cycled back to the Members in the end, through services and rates.  The Credit Union in which I bank and work offers free checking, free online banking, free mobile banking, free coin counting machines, free shared service center usage (out of state), free telephone banking, free bill pay etc etc.\n\nAt a CU, The Board of Directors are volunteer, voted upon by the Membership.  There is no corporate interest controlling decisions of a Credit Union. You have a say, as you are a part owner.\n\nCredit Unions are also heavily invested in increasing the quality of the community in which they are located.  This ties directly with the not-for-profit status.

They also took flak for holding every loan 100% through the end instead of breaking up payments from bank-to-bank to spread around the risk. They responded in a letter to members that they aren't here to make a big profit. We're here to make sure members have their money when they need it, have access to borrowing loans based on the community's collective credit rating, and would meet interest promises based on everyone paying back the loans they'd made. As a money sucking whore at the time? I was fuming. The tirade was noteworthy. \"Only in Portland would a group of bankers turn down money!\" (I'm cleaning that up..my mom is probably watching).\n\nFlash forward to 2009, they (I should say we)..WE were in better shape than a lot of banks. We never rode the crest of the wave, but we sure as hell didn't get caught in the trough either. I remembered that letter our CU President (that I dumbly voted AGAINST during re-election) wrote to the members a couple years prior, and cooly waited for a simple post-it note saying \"told you so.\"...It never came though. I wish it had. I would have framed it and put it on my wall.\n\nOn top of that? I have a mortgage. I have 6 months worth of payments saved. I also lost my job, and didn't get a new one for 7 months. I know I know, Suze Orman says I need a year. I didn't have a year ok? I really like beer and my battle.net account.\n\nI wound up a month behind on my payments. I called the number for the person responsible for maintaining my loan, and told them what was up. She credited me the compounding late fees, threw another 200 bucks on my monthly payments until I was caught up, and waived the extra interest.\n\nTotal time to execute? Around 10 minutes, and she finished by referring me to a head hunter. She'd check in from time to time, to see if I was surviving. She was watching unemployment hit my account, and wondered if I was able to keep the lights on, or if I needed to throttle back the payment to 50-75 bucks until I got more cash. 5 months later, she called me and told me I was caught up, grats on the new job, and thanked *ME* for my business. \n\nSo why a CU instead of a bank?

That's not to say that just joining a Credit Union and ditching a commercial bank will solve the problems that large commercial banking firms cause (what with speculative investing and all) but to even compare a Credit Union to a Bank in terms of them being evil and money grubbing is ignorant at best, and plain idiotic at worst.\n\nI suppose some of the very basic, important differences should be noted:\n\nCredit Unions are not-for-profit organizations.  They exist solely to provide services to their members. For just about all Credit Unions, Member Service is the NUMBER ONE GOAL.  You could essentially call any person with a single dollar held at a Credit Union a \"Shareholder\".\n\nBanks are for-profit, with their only allegiance being to shareholders. All actions are expected to show a profit.  You are not number 1 in the Bank's eyes. You're probably not even number 10.  Decisions are all made by highly paid executives, influenced by wealthy investors (other corporations) with the customer's interest rarely taken into account.\n\nJust that comparison there should be enough to clue anyone in as to why a Credit Union should be your first choice.  Look at Bank of America and their $5 dollar debit card fee.  In the Credit Union world, an idea like that would be absolute lunacy.  Fees and income from a Credit Union essentially get cycled back to the Members in the end, through services and rates.  The Credit Union in which I bank and work offers free checking, free online banking, free mobile banking, free coin counting machines, free shared service center usage (out of state), free telephone banking, free bill pay etc etc.\n\nAt a CU, The Board of Directors are volunteer, voted upon by the Membership.  There is no corporate interest controlling decisions of a Credit Union. You have a say, as you are a part owner.\n\nCredit Unions are also heavily invested in increasing the quality of the community in which they are located.  This ties directly with the not-for-profit status.  More members = more revenue = better/free services = more employees/better employee pay = increased community involvement = more members.", "id": "c2srj0y"}], [{"comment": "For some reason I read BofA as \"Bank of Fucking America\"...", "id": "c2srlnv"}], [{"comment": "I moved from a bank (Canada), to a CR quite awhile ago.

Just my opinion though, so take it how you will.\n\n\nGrowing up I was in a shit environment.  The word \"abuse\" doesn't really cut it.  I decided that I wasn't going to grow up to be that same type of person, and I made a conscious decision to change.  Talk about playing the long game!  I saw the faults and chose not to repeat those same actions as I grew to be an adult.  That's what you need to do - Break the cycle.  It's easy to fall into the same path that you were exposed to your entire life, but at the end of the day regret and \"should have, could have\" don't fix anything.  When the day comes that you have kids (if you chose to), think about how things were for you and what you would have done differently.\n\nHere's the cold hard fact - your relationship with your folks may never get better.  There's a chance that you or them will hold resentment for the rest of your lives.  I'm sure that you've been told to re-evaluate your friends, well, that same advice can be offered for family sometimes, too.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think that that family is probably the most worthwhile cause to support, and that you should do anything that you can to make it work.  At the same time, sometimes you just have to cut your losses and move on with your life.  You said that you're an adult, and I don't know if you're still living with them, but if you are -  bide your time, follow the rules, then get out and be the person that you want to be.  You may have to grow up faster than you want, and may wish that you had the Normal Rockwell family, but remember that you can eventually have that if you make it for yourself.  Try not to pity yourself, but instead empower yourself.\n\nNow here's some fatherly advice -\n\n* talking and being open - Don't be ashamed of your feelings.  Even if nothing that you say changes how your folks react to you, you'll know that you spoke your mind.  It's an empowering feeling, embrace it.\n\n\n* Atheism - religion requires faith.  It's a firm belief in something that is inherently unbelievable.  It's not for everyone.  I personally believe that churches can play a strong role because of the values that religion tend to hold.  Be good to others, be good to yourself.  I'm an atheist too, by the way.\n\n* Cannabis use - I'm pro legalization/regulation/taxation, but the cold hard fact is that it is still illegal.  Your folks don't have to stand behind you breaking the law, and you should respect their wishes while you're around them.  If you do decide to use it, do so responsibly.  Don't drive, go to work/school under the influence, or pressure others into using it.  That's just not right.  They may have used in the past, but no longer do, I don't know, but that doesn't make them hypocrites, either.  It comes back to the fact that people can change.\n\nGood luck, and I hope that everything works out for you in the long run.  It's not going to be easy, and there will be setbacks, just keep on keeping on!\n\n\n", "id": "c2szrjm"}], [{"comment": "My parents were pretty laidback just trying to protect me.

I think it was kind of a showcase feature at the time the school was built. \n\nAt recess, a couple groups of kids would build \"volcanoes\" in the silty sand on the playground. They'd heap up the dirt, and meanwhile, a chain of kids would go to the fountains, take a mouthful of water, and then run over to the \"volcano\" and spit/dribble the water on it, while the other kids -- always just two -- built up the mountain on moistened dirt. \n\nThis would continue, and the industry of it all is an impressive memory in my mind. It was a constant line of water-spitters, racing back and forth from the volcano to the drinking fountains. \n\nAfter the thing got yay high, they'd start concentrating on the peak, forming a crater, while the two builders would start tunneling at the base, toward the center. \n\nEventually, their hands would meet, and the crater would reach the tunnel. \n\nAt that point, they would shake hands in a solemn ceremony, followed by much cheering and back slapping on the part of the water-spitters. The feeling of accomplishment was intense. \n\nAfter that, all the water-spitters got to take their turn reaching in and shaking hands with one another. \n\nThere was no class distinction between the builders and the water-spitters. Nobody was better than anyone else. The ones who were the builders were just the ones who got a good start, attracting the most water-spitters. \n\nAt the beginning of recess, maybe half a dozen volcanoes were started, and it was up to the water-spitters to choose whichever ones to add their efforts to. After a few minutes, a \"shakeout\" whittled the number of volcanoes down to two, as the builders who were unsuccessful at attracting water-spitters gave up and became water-spitters themselves. \n\nWhen the bell rang, we kicked and destroyed the volcanoes.

I think it was kind of a showcase feature at the time the school was built. \n\nAt recess, a couple groups of kids would build \"volcanoes\" in the silty sand on the playground. They'd heap up the dirt, and meanwhile, a chain of kids would go to the fountains, take a mouthful of water, and then run over to the \"volcano\" and spit/dribble the water on it, while the other kids -- always just two -- built up the mountain on moistened dirt. \n\nThis would continue, and the industry of it all is an impressive memory in my mind. It was a constant line of water-spitters, racing back and forth from the volcano to the drinking fountains. \n\nAfter the thing got yay high, they'd start concentrating on the peak, forming a crater, while the two builders would start tunneling at the base, toward the center. \n\nEventually, their hands would meet, and the crater would reach the tunnel. \n\nAt that point, they would shake hands in a solemn ceremony, followed by much cheering and back slapping on the part of the water-spitters. The feeling of accomplishment was intense. \n\nAfter that, all the water-spitters got to take their turn reaching in and shaking hands with one another. \n\nThere was no class distinction between the builders and the water-spitters. Nobody was better than anyone else. The ones who were the builders were just the ones who got a good start, attracting the most water-spitters. \n\nAt the beginning of recess, maybe half a dozen volcanoes were started, and it was up to the water-spitters to choose whichever ones to add their efforts to. After a few minutes, a \"shakeout\" whittled the number of volcanoes down to two, as the builders who were unsuccessful at attracting water-spitters gave up and became water-spitters themselves. \n\nWhen the bell rang, we kicked and destroyed the volcanoes.

They use fast neutrons and aren't used any where in the US, basically because of nuclear proliferation concerns.\n\nJust curious, because a thermal breeder reactor would be pretty amazing.  Especially the bit where it won't produce weaponizable isotopes, because then they might start using breeder reactors here in the US.  I really hope that Forbes is right when they talk about the Thorium breeder cycle using thermal neutrons, because I think it would lead to much quicker Thorium cycle adoption in the US.

Also ignored are the daunting problems, both engineering and safety, involved in developing the Thorium Cycle.\n\nThe reactor shown in the article is the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in China. The reactors there are Chinese designed CPN-600s (quite conventional pressurized light water reactors) and Canadian designed CANDU reactors (the name derived from CANada Deuterium Uranium). Neither use Thorium based fuel fuel.\n\nCanada HAS spent over 50 years researching Thorium Fuel Cycle reactors.

Germany and India at one time each had Thorium reactors in use though I couldn't tell you if those are still active currently. \n\nUnfortunately in the U.S. law currently prohibits the funding of thorium fuel cycles hence why it's hasn't caught on as much.  One of the technologies that has since replaced the hole left by Thorium tech includes MOX fuel which is a Russian method called mixed oxide fuel.  Unfortunately its still very radioactive and does have the potential to extract weapon level materials from it.\n\nIf you are really interested in reading over it I suggest Looking over some of the congressional committee hearings over the issue in the last few years, multiple senators / reps have been discussing it.

They use fast neutrons and aren't used any where in the US, basically because of nuclear proliferation concerns.\n\nJust curious, because a thermal breeder reactor would be pretty amazing.  Especially the bit where it won't produce weaponizable isotopes, because then they might start using breeder reactors here in the US.  I really hope that Forbes is right when they talk about the Thorium breeder cycle using thermal neutrons, because I think it would lead to much quicker Thorium cycle adoption in the US.

Like fast reactors, it uses about 99% of the energy content of the fuel, rather than the 1% of uranium thermal reactors. Thorium only has one common isotope which is exactly what you need, so no enrichment is necessary.\n\nAnother advantage of being thermal is that it only takes about a tenth as much startup fuel (from \"nuclear waste\" and decommissioned warheads), compared to fast reactors. If we wanted to replace fossil fuels with nuclear power over the next several decades, fast reactors couldn't do it without also building new conventional reactors. Thorium [could](http://energyfromthorium.com/plan/).\n\n(If for some reason thorium doesn't work out, we do have a fast-reactor design ready to go.

FDA manages medication, and the DEA is currently the agency enforcing marijuana laws.\n\n- What legal and regulatory safeguards need to be put in place before we just instantly legalize it?

Not really. I mean sure, it's an entertaining read and has a certain appeal to the adolescent mind with its \"talented child genius called upon to save the world\" theme (see also Harry Potter series), but as *literature* it's dime novel pulp stuff, thoroughly non-compelling and really not all that cleverly written. If you read Card's original short story *Ender's Game*, it's more obvious just how much meaningless **filler** he shoveled into it to stretch it to book length--- all the stuff with his siblings on \"the nets\", the pointless random dreamland phlosophy of the computer simulation world, etc. The original story was just ENDer at battle school, then commanding the human fleet to victory, then a few generals afterwards verbally musing whether it was truly *moral* for adults to be using up children as weapons like that--- basically Card not being sure he'd belabored the point sufficiently, so he spelled it out for us in case we're stupid. Thing is, it's a pretty cheesy moral, and his execution is fairly weak to boot. Nothing Ender did in battle school was actually all that clever. Card apparently couldn't devise any **truly** interesting tactics, so he just had the other teams act like complete idiots, then have the instructors *gush* over the genius of Ender when he won by being slightly less stupid. Then he makes the inexplicable leap that a child showing (supposed) tactical genius can be thrown into a position of *strategic* command and somehow translate the same facility into victory. Anyone with a modicum of military experience knows the two are almost wholly dissimilar. On top of it all, he describes prepubescent **children** as developing muscles, reflexes, and intellectual capacity that the nature of human biology dictates is impossible. It *maybe* might have been possible with them as teenagers when they started, but 7 yr old Bean as a squad leader under 10 yr old Ender as platoon leader? Complete nonsense. 7-10 yr old children simply don't have the **capacity** for such development, as such development is *absolutely dependent* on the associated physical development of puberty. Then again, if Card had made them teenagers, it would have ruined his melodramatic \"adults using children as weapons\" theme.\n\nSo no, *Ender's Game* isn't literarily great. It's entertaining, sure, but it lacks any sophisticated philosophical depth and the raw execution is weak. I think a lot of introverted nerdy guys read it at an age where they strongly identified with Ender, themselves feeling like unpopular, unrecognized geniuses. I certainly felt that way in my youth. I didn't read the book then, though, I read it 10 years later, as a 24 year old  sergeant in the Army. As a result I saw *Ender's Game* for what it is. It boggles my mind that the USMC has put *Ender's Game* on their OCS reading list. Its value to people in the **real military** is nil. There's a thread of \"improvise to changing conditions\" throughout the book, which the USMC likes to emphasize, but the book offers no particular insight into *how* to improvise. Card basically just says \"Ender thinks outside a very simplified box and wins again\".", "id": "c2sr76w"}, {"comment": "No one here is putting Ender's Game on the same level as Infinite Jest, Ulysses or The Odyssey, but it is a definitely a book I would recommend everyone read. You seem to have missed most of the points of the book (yes adults using children as weapons is one among many) and dwell on some things that need not be dwelled on.\n\n\nHis siblings: Interestingly enough, Peter and Valentine become possibly MORE important than Ender in the grand scheme of things and are not 'thrown in as filler.' They are major characters for the remainder of the series.\n\n\"the nets\" which you brush off as pointless are possibly the most genius thing Card puts in the book, as it IS a science fiction book. The book was published in 1985 and he predicts the importance and omnipresence of the internet (not to mention tablet computers) with remarkable accuracy. Message boards, chatroom, news rooms, moderators, editors, its all there 10 years before any of it really becomes available.\n\nThe ideal of its value to \"real military\" is pointless. It was not written as some sort of strategic volume it is a story written for 17 year olds. It IS however, a great way to introduce new soldiers and new officers (who start training when they are 17...) to the importance of relying on each other and gaining the trust of your fellow soldiers and yeah, it talks about thinking outside the box -- simple boxes are doubly important to think outside of (and often the most difficult).\n\nIt also brings into moral light the total destruction of the buggers and whether this was a move that was legitimate.\n\nYour points about children not being able to do such and such are pretty meaningless -- these are supposed to be super-children, fed, bred, and taught to be super human almost from birth. The earth is so overpopulated everyone can only have 2 children and these kids are like the 200 smartest people in the world (out of probably something like 20 billion).

Read about it yourself [here](http://peachfront.diaryland.com/enderhitlte.html).", "id": "c2sv08l"}, {"comment": "Well there's at least a couple differences between Ender and Hitler.\n\nIn Ender's Game the buggers posed an obvious threat to the mankind. And so Ender was more or less created by the government as a tool to wipe the buggers out. AND Ender didn't even know he was killing buggers in the end. AND he was a kid being controlled by adults. AND it made Ender feel like crap. And when he actually understood the Bugger he sought to undo his harm. Likewise with the buggers, they almost wiped out mankind due to their misunderstanding.\n\nHowever Hitler, a grown man, sought to wipe out the Jews, who never posed a threat to humanity, by his own free will and was never sorry for it. And even if he were, he would still be nothing like Ender.\n\nBut I've often found that people almost never change their mind on this topic.", "id": "c2t6vhn"}, {"comment": "I didn't say that I agreed with the point of view. I think the novel is a ham-fisted cash in which inserts a bunch of arbitrary plot-points fromm which to hang the utterly inferior second novel. I found this article yesterday, and thought it was a very interesting point of view. Also I was amused by the notion that the novelisation of Ender's Game was ghost written.\n\nDid you read the article I linke to?", "id": "c2t9ice"}, {"comment": "Yes i read the entire article and some of John Kessel's. I didn't see anywhere about it being ghost written, and I've read enough of Card's work to say that it wasn't. Many of the parallels are a stretch or meaningless. And nothing is cited which makes it difficult to judge the claims. She said that Ender had an almost insect-like love for Valentine. Nowhere in the book does does it even hint at that. That was just a desperate attempt to draw parallels to Hitler. Besides, Ender was like 10 years old. Give me a break. I say, let's forget about all these isolated comparisons. Why don't we look at what real issues people have with Ender's Game. For some reason it rubs some people the wrong way when they read about some perfect in nearly every way kid killing yet not doing anything wrong. So how about this. Your life is in danger by some crazy killer. Is it ok to defend yourself by killing him given the chance? I say yes. She's making the Jew/Bugger comparison, yet the scenarios in Ender's Game and the Holocaust are totally different. She claimed that Novinha was blamed for her own abuse in Speaker. I've read Speaker and this is simply not true. Her complaints about how the science fiction in the book was out there, well guess what, it IS science fiction. And she was actually put of by Jane's existence. It annoyed her that Jane spent her time talking to a man, much less Ender. And it annoyed her that Jane didn't have any woman parts. You see where this is going? Well I don't. There might be a couple insignificant isolated facts that parallel Ender and Hilter, just like every other character in existence. For example I share the same birthday as Selphie Tilmitt from FFVIII. Anyways the author of that article thinks that Ender's Game resonates with people because it tells them that their suffering makes them special and gives them a righteous reason to destroy their enemies. Yet in Ender's Game he only does what he needs to to stay alive. I think she's annoyed that Orson Scott Card even could suggest the existence of such an awesome person as Ender.\n\nIn war you crush your enemy and you don't play fair in order to protect yourself and everyone you care about.

It does not claim to be an authority.\n\nI do not believe that Card used a ghost writer. I do believe he had much more of an axe to grind (probably several) with his rewrite. I am sure that his politics were more extreme later in his life, and that he had a laundry list of plot points and characters to insert to make the (terrible) sequil somehow relevant.\n\nI brought it to your attention because I found it amusing that there was a serious discussion that Card used a ghost writer. I have no idea of the company Card keeps, nor what he or they would gain by re-working the short story into a shitty novel. I think events are very easy to explain by drawing a paralell to George Lucas and his re-release of Star Wars. To sum up in two words: Cash In. Novellas don't sell for much money. Writers get paid (roughly) by the word. The novelisation of what is arguably the best thing Card ever wrote made exponentially more money than the novella. The following (increasingly crap) books were a nice little earner for a professional writer.\n\nCard is a tool. His work has become less relevant and of a lower standard with every passing year. He will be thrilled that the forthcoming movie will thrust him back into popular culture and to a new audience. I am waiting for Hollywood to vomit all over this (like they do with most everything good) and fuck up what little good is left in one of the most powerful and moving short stories from my youth.\n\nRegardless of what I think, people will continue to rave about Enders Game (the novel) as the best and most wonderful story they have ever read, just like they do with Twilight.", "id": "c2tqmj4"}], [{"comment": "did you know that you are very strong?", "id": "c2sqol1"}], [{"comment": "My vote is for [The Little Prince](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince).", "id": "c2sqpbh"}, {"comment": "I never could get into The Little Prince.

You could caption funny pictures in a contest, you could read the startlingly intelligent works of David Wong, or you could lose your goddamn mind reading John Dies at the End.\nI read the entire book there, in the dark corridor between three classrooms, and then had to walk back to my car.\n\n\nI had to walk through the woods at night to get there; I'd parked at the entrance to the paths for the park reserve, because I couldn't afford a school parking permit and it seemed like a good idea before I read that book.\n\n\nThe almost-full moon in October was bright enough to help ward off the usual \"woods at night\" fears, and that electric tingle at the base of your skull that's controlled by the light switch at the bottom of basement steps everywhere. \n\n\nStill, I was power-walking through the woods at a pretty stern clip. I was recounting to myself some of the more ridiculous parts of the book like a patronus to keep the book's leathery-winged shadows at bay when the moon went out. I could see the outline of the cloud that was crossing it, but not very much else. I took out the flashlight fob I have on my keys, and flat-out Olympics 100 meter ran my way to the tiny lot by its woefully inadequate light.\n\n\nI hopped in the car Duke-style and blew out of the lot like a champagne cork with the devil after it. I turned the corner so hard I felt as if I were going to put the car up on two wheels, and sped down the little boondocks highway that ran past my speck of a town.\n\n\nI hit the breaks so hard coming into my building's lot that I left marks. I wrenched the door open, and slammed it behind me.\nI was still using the flashlight on my keys, even though there were streetlamps and houselights that drowned its wan pool. I shot up the stairs three per stride, and had to use both hands to fumble the key into the lock.\n\n\nI nearly leaped through it, and closed it to whatever thing might be chasing me, and stood gulping air in the dimly lit entrance to my apartment.\n\n\nIf I had an October birthday, this story would have a fun ending where I shit my pants because my friends threw on the lights and yelled \"SURPRISE!\"\n\n\nSadly, I do not, and they did not. They were not there.

Sure, there's a tiny little fraction of the organization that still has government oversight, but MOST of the organization is an international crime syndicate which uses the grey areas of international law to murder and steal.  We found this out when Oliver North was put on trial and his superiors testified in Congress in the 80s.  It's on YouTube, you can watch the dudes lay it all out.  They maintain their own army, navy, and air force.  They deal drugs and arms to raise money for their operations.  And it is entirely a 'black' organization, with absolutely no legal oversight whatsoever.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that the US government is too afraid to come out and excommunicate the CIA, shut down the tiny piece still attached to the government, and help hunt down and kill all of the CIA agents around the world breaking international law on a daily basis.  Most of what they do is secret, but we know enough to make one thing conclusively clear - they are the single most widespread and active enemy of democracy on the planet.  They rigged the elections in Afghanistan so poorly that the whole thing had to be thrown out, just so they could get Karzai in there so they could manipulate him through his brother, and retain control over the opium trade.  They rigged elections in Iraq.  They rigged elections in Haiti.  They kill candidates they don't think will serve US interests.  Killing everyone so that every nation in the world ends up with a pro-US leader is NOT democracy.  It is the most cynical rejection of democracy.  It is saying 'we know democracy can never work.  We know democracy is a joke.  The only way to get ahead is stomping on babies and robbing the innocent.\n\nThe real sick part is that most of the public inherently agrees.  They think the idea of a government controlled by the general public is patently insane.  They think everyone is so stupid that it would be guaranteed to collapse into utter chaos, and thinking it could work is a ridiculously naive pipe dream.  They think it's all a nice illusion that is only maintained by men in the shadows \"making the hard choices\" and feeding puppies into paper shredders to make the illusion of civility possible.  These are some of the most dangerous views in the world today.\n\nOh, and the CIA admitted a few years ago that all of Vietnam was their fault.  They wanted America to go to war in Vietnam, so they made up the Gulf of Tonkin incident, lied about it to the world, and tricked the politicians into going to war.  This is supposed to be a fucking intelligence agency, providing information to politicians.

Dec!. of Constance E. Rea, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't of Def., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 271 'U~ 12-14) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10,2008). Apparently, the videotapes were retained in the field, without physically having been transferred to the OIG and without otherwise having been sent to headquarters. Id.; see also Dec!. ofAlicia L. Bannon, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't ofDef., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 450, Exs. 41-42) (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2011). Nor can I say that the individuals who destroyed, or who approved the destruction, of the videotapes, were aware of court orders requiring identification or production of the videotapes. However, the lapses ofindividuals cannot excuse the failures of the Agency. The CIA, qua agency, had the obligation to identify or produce the videotapes, and the CIA cannot be excused in its dereliction because of particular individuals' lapses.\n\n**Basics of the decision** It is true that the interrogation videotapes, having been destroyed nearly six years ago, cannot now be produced. But the CIA has remedied that failure by a massive production of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 documents-records that deseribe the contents ofthe videotapes, corresponding in time to their creation, and records that relate to the videotapes' destruction, in particular, the persons and reasons behind the destruction, corresponding in time to both the videotapes' creation and destruction. Plaintiffs have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate whether those records, or any of them, are exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption I or 3 or must be produced.\n\n**Summary** \"The measure ofthe court's power in civil contempt proceedings is determined by the requirements offull remedial relief.\" McComb, 336 U.S. at 193. Because plaintiffs already have achieved substantial remedial relief and would be entitled to no further relief if I were to find the CIA in civil contempt, I deny plaintiffs' motion to hold the CIA in contempt.\n\nAlso, I would like to add this case is being appealed. I am sorry, but I fail to see how this decision makes *\"US government above the law\"*\n\nMy personal opinion? I don't totally agree with the court, but I see how it came to its conclusion. Not sure whether the appellate court will uphold or reverse, but I'm leaning toward the opinion being upheld. My problem is with these incredibly annoying sensationalist titles.

Most of us are pretty happy here and we'd rather not shake things up.

Sure, there's a tiny little fraction of the organization that still has government oversight, but MOST of the organization is an international crime syndicate which uses the grey areas of international law to murder and steal.  We found this out when Oliver North was put on trial and his superiors testified in Congress in the 80s.  It's on YouTube, you can watch the dudes lay it all out.  They maintain their own army, navy, and air force.  They deal drugs and arms to raise money for their operations.  And it is entirely a 'black' organization, with absolutely no legal oversight whatsoever.\n\nThe worst thing about it is that the US government is too afraid to come out and excommunicate the CIA, shut down the tiny piece still attached to the government, and help hunt down and kill all of the CIA agents around the world breaking international law on a daily basis.  Most of what they do is secret, but we know enough to make one thing conclusively clear - they are the single most widespread and active enemy of democracy on the planet.  They rigged the elections in Afghanistan so poorly that the whole thing had to be thrown out, just so they could get Karzai in there so they could manipulate him through his brother, and retain control over the opium trade.  They rigged elections in Iraq.  They rigged elections in Haiti.  They kill candidates they don't think will serve US interests.  Killing everyone so that every nation in the world ends up with a pro-US leader is NOT democracy.  It is the most cynical rejection of democracy.  It is saying 'we know democracy can never work.  We know democracy is a joke.  The only way to get ahead is stomping on babies and robbing the innocent.\n\nThe real sick part is that most of the public inherently agrees.  They think the idea of a government controlled by the general public is patently insane.  They think everyone is so stupid that it would be guaranteed to collapse into utter chaos, and thinking it could work is a ridiculously naive pipe dream.  They think it's all a nice illusion that is only maintained by men in the shadows \"making the hard choices\" and feeding puppies into paper shredders to make the illusion of civility possible.  These are some of the most dangerous views in the world today.\n\nOh, and the CIA admitted a few years ago that all of Vietnam was their fault.  They wanted America to go to war in Vietnam, so they made up the Gulf of Tonkin incident, lied about it to the world, and tricked the politicians into going to war.

Dec!. of Constance E. Rea, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't of Def., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 271 'U~ 12-14) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 10,2008). Apparently, the videotapes were retained in the field, without physically having been transferred to the OIG and without otherwise having been sent to headquarters. Id.; see also Dec!. ofAlicia L. Bannon, Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep't ofDef., No. 04 Civ. 4151 (Doc. No. 450, Exs. 41-42) (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2011). Nor can I say that the individuals who destroyed, or who approved the destruction, of the videotapes, were aware of court orders requiring identification or production of the videotapes. However, the lapses ofindividuals cannot excuse the failures of the Agency. The CIA, qua agency, had the obligation to identify or produce the videotapes, and the CIA cannot be excused in its dereliction because of particular individuals' lapses.\n\n**Basics of the decision** It is true that the interrogation videotapes, having been destroyed nearly six years ago, cannot now be produced. But the CIA has remedied that failure by a massive production of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 documents-records that deseribe the contents ofthe videotapes, corresponding in time to their creation, and records that relate to the videotapes' destruction, in particular, the persons and reasons behind the destruction, corresponding in time to both the videotapes' creation and destruction. Plaintiffs have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate whether those records, or any of them, are exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption I or 3 or must be produced.\n\n**Summary** \"The measure ofthe court's power in civil contempt proceedings is determined by the requirements offull remedial relief.\" McComb, 336 U.S. at 193. Because plaintiffs already have achieved substantial remedial relief and would be entitled to no further relief if I were to find the CIA in civil contempt, I deny plaintiffs' motion to hold the CIA in contempt.\n\nAlso, I would like to add this case is being appealed.

What you're referring to is the difference between those that liked it and those that didn't like it, which could be one metric of gauging how liked something is in general.\n\nThere's an infinite number of ways to weight likes and dislikes, however. You could compare the proportion of likes over the total likes and dislikes, for instance, to get closer to the probability that someone will like a video. The simple difference is actually probably one of the least effective/useful metrics one might consider using for this type of thing since it does not scale well. If there's a video with 100 million likes and dislikes, the difference of 100 isn't all that substantial. If the video has only 100 likes or dislikes, however, the difference is very substantial. In terms of gauging how well received the content was by those who actually viewed it, the difference here is clearly not going to tell you much.

What you're referring to is the difference between those that liked it and those that didn't like it, which could be one metric of gauging how liked something is in general.\n\nThere's an infinite number of ways to weight likes and dislikes, however. You could compare the proportion of likes over the total likes and dislikes, for instance, to get closer to the probability that someone will like a video. The simple difference is actually probably one of the least effective/useful metrics one might consider using for this type of thing since it does not scale well. If there's a video with 100 million likes and dislikes, the difference of 100 isn't all that substantial. If the video has only 100 likes or dislikes, however, the difference is very substantial. In terms of gauging how well received the content was by those who actually viewed it, the difference here is clearly not going to tell you much.

This comic is the very definition of political satire.  Read the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire) for satire or something, since it seems you have some sort of overly strict list of requirements for a work to be considered satire that just flat don't exist.\n\n> Doesn't humor usually derive from a disparity between observation and fact?\n\nI also don't understand where you get that idea.  Sure that is one form of humor, but humor comes in all forms and I would say that isn't even close to the most common.  Hell, pretty much all of stand-up comedy revolves around pointing out amusing anecdotes about the world around you, or pointing out otherwise unamusing anecdotes in amusing ways.\n\nIt sounds like you just have a much narrower view than most people in what you find funny, and that's fine.  However, humor is in the eye of the beholder and just because you don't find something funny or amusing does not mean you can declare it to be humorless.  I think the very fact that there is a 100+ comments from people who found this comic funny means you can't even claim that this is not funny, just that _you_ don't find it funny.", "id": "c2ssj3s"}, {"comment": ">However, humor is in the eye of the beholder and just because you don't find something funny or amusing does not mean you can declare it to be humorless.\n\nYeah I know, that's why I was asking what I was missing, this is obviously funny to others.\n\n>Hell, pretty much all of stand-up comedy revolves around pointing out amusing anecdotes about the world around you, or pointing out otherwise unamusing anecdotes in amusing ways.\n\nYes but the humor comes from the *way* things are observed which is most often not factually. No observational humor is funny if it is literal (That's when you end up with statements like: \"What's the deal with airline food, it's really awful.\" Yeah we know that's not comedy just fact). All observational comedy falls flat if you actually pick it apart and find the reasonable behavior behind the apparently absurd behavior (For example: \"Airline food is bad because because it is incredibly cheap and steamed via the heat from the plane's engines\" Now any humor that could have been there is dissipated).\n\nBut what I really meant is about the disparity between observation and given fact, a man notices someone acting in a way that is unusual or counter intuitive to a logical behavior and behold, hilarity ensues.\nOr even notices that standard practiced behavior is illogical or counter intuitive, the logical fallacy (aka disparity between observed behavior and expected behavior) is the humor.\n\nI think all humor can be reduced to expectation and having the opposite of those expectations fulfilled.\n\nTension and release.\n\n>Are you telling me you literally looked at the last panel and thought to yourself, \"I see, this comic is clearly describing a statement of fact often overlooked in the war on drugs through a parallel using dandelions. While logical, this is entirely devoid of humor due to the analogy only amounting to a straight-faced statement of fact.\"\n\nYes, that's why I wrote it.\n\nI do however find this conversation amusing.\n\nEdit: I think all of the replies to my comment would have been unnecessary if someone had just told me: \"You did get it, you just didn't find it funny.\"\n", "id": "c2stk2m"}, {"comment": "> Yeah I know, that's why I was asking what I was missing, this is obviously funny to others.\n\nWell I think at the time it was mildly funny, while also attempting to point out the absurdity in the \"just say no\" campaign (that's the political satire part).  Pointing out that overloading kids with warnings about drugs will have the opposite effect is not merely stating a non-novel statement of fact as you claim, otherwise we would have never had that stupid campaign to begin with.  Clearly to a large majority that idea is not only non-obvious, but some even rejected it.  I bet there were people that even took irrational offense to this comic.  \n\nEspecially to the reddit crowd, there is added humor in viewing this comic in hindsight.  I suspect you too are affected by viewing this message in hindsight, but for you it is lowering the humor rather than increasing it.  Looking back retrospectively at the point this comic is attempting to make about the \"just say no\" campaign, we have the benefit of hindsight that allows us to see this message as obvious.  \n\nTo you that has turned the comic from funny into merely pointing out a truth you accept so innately, you have trouble viewing it as anything but a mere statement of fact.  To the rest of us though, this adds humor by first causing us to think \"haha awesome, that guy got it from the start.\"  But then also of the depressing hilarity that even back then not only were there people who got it, but tried to warn others and yet the campaign charged on forward.\n\nComics are also not always supposed to be gut-busting funny, a large aspect of them their is character development and aesthetically pleasing artwork.  I never followed this comic, but I'm willing to bet that someone who knows this character would have the added humor in thinking \"ha! That's _just_ like so-and-so to do that!\"\n\n> No observational humor is funny if it is literal\n\nSee that is exactly what I was disagreeing with.  The stand-up comics I usually find the funniest are the ones that make me think, \"HA that's so true, that _does_ happen all the time!/they _do_ act like that in that situation!\"  A simple flat statement like \"What's the deal with airline food?  It's awful\" is indeed unfunny if flatly delivered in those words.  However, a good comedian could go on for an hour ripping on humans for wearing backpacks and have the crowd in stitches.  Especially if he ends by merely describing, exactly as it happened, a real life event from his childhood about a kid who would filled his backpack extremely full to save time while ignoring the warnings of those around him.  Only to end up falling backwards and being unable to get up as everyone busts up laughing.  A factual story told exactly as it happened and was observed, but extremely funny if delivered half-way decently.  \n\nEven if you are saying that someone merely stating commonly known facts is never funny, I still don't buy it.  I bet a good comedian could compile a list of facts that would make people laugh out loud when read one after the other in order.  I guess you could still say the comedy is in the delivery if you consider the order they are put the delivery, but then at what point does the delivery become disjointed from the content?\n\nI also don't know why you think a comedian must rip apart the reasons _why_ an absurd behavior happens, this comic certainly didn't do that.  If you are saying all observational comedy becomes unfunny to the listener if they were to pick it apart themselves, then uhhh don't do that?  I also don't buy that doing so would be inherently unfunny, sometimes the reasons why we do absurd behaviors are absurd and hilarious in themselves.  \n\n> But what I really meant is about the disparity between observation and given fact, a man notices someone acting in a way that is unusual or counter intuitive to a logical behavior and behold, hilarity ensues. Or even notices that standard practiced behavior is illogical or counter intuitive, the logical fallacy (aka disparity between observed behavior and expected behavior) is the humor.  \n>  \n> I think all humor can be reduced to expectation and having the opposite of those expectations fulfilled.\n\nWhat you describe is one _type_ of humor, and I'd agree you could boil down a lot of modern humor to fit that archetype.  However, you can't possibly think that _all_ humor falls under that archetype.  Think about any joke that has ever been told, that is based on a stereotype.  Someone telling a story their coworkers find humorous about how they nearly got hit by a little black Honda, and low and behold he looks over and it's an Asian women, is funny precisely because they had an expectation and that _exact_ expectation was filled.\n\n> Edit: I think all of the replies to my comment would have been unnecessary if someone had just told me: \"You did get it, you just didn't find it funny.\"\n\nExactly, humor is diverse, subjective, and entirely in the eye of the beholder.  Things also almost certainly cease to become humorous at the point where you have to break the down and analyze them.", "id": "c2svlzd"}, {"comment": "It's satire.

The objectives of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, what they\u2019re trying to accomplish with their military action in these countries is the following: \u2018To remove dictatorship and stop the oppression of our people; to fight for the immediate restoration of the competitive multiparty democracy in Uganda; to see an end to gross violation of human rights and dignity of Ugandans; to ensure the restoration of peace and security in Uganda, to ensure unity, sovereignty, and economic prosperity beneficial to all Ugandans, and to bring to an end the repressive policy of deliberate marginalization of groups of people who may not agree with the LRA ideology.\u2019 Those are the objectives of the group that we are fighting, or who are being fought and we are joining in the effort to remove them from the battlefield.\u201d\n", "id": "c2sqzg1"}, {"comment": "I often wonder if people like Rush actually support the political ideology of people like Hitler.

First you are comparing a deployment of 100 US soldiers to a 175,000 person army. Second, although Saddam was a detestable villain, he was a sovereign head of state, recognized by world courts. Third, the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Joseph Kony, while the UN refused to countenance the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nRemember, also, that politics is the art of the possible. The concept of precedent is only useful to level charges of hypocrisy during debates. Precedent does not play a factor in international affairs. The 2003 Iraq war was opposed by many who saw it as an unjustified act of aggression by the US. That's a valid reason to oppose that war. There are also those who thought that Saddam should be removed from power, but predicted (sadly, accurately) that we'd do more harm than good if we invaded the country.

And that's what has basically been happening over the past 200 years.

These symbols allow those that read equations, definitions, or proofs to quickly and unambiguously understand what is being discussed. If you end up studying higher math for a while, you become familiar and comfortable with this style of notation. \n\nInterestingly, notation like this and the thought process it represents is important in [understanding the structure of mathematical logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_numbering), forms a large part of the [basis of automata theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory) (aka why you're able to enjoy complex technology, like computers), and may [hold key insights into the nature of consciousness and sentience itself.](http://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1318910159&sr=8-1)\n\nIf you've got the stomach for the notation, wide worlds of fascinating information await!", "id": "c2sctuy"}, {"comment": "Actually, we're able to enjoy complex technology because people started working together on large projects. And those large projects are highly dependent on readable code.  If people were still so dependent on basement coder style shorthand, we'd still be dealing with extremely small scoped bug ridden software.  Chances are the more advanced the project is, the more likely it's code is verbose and follows well established patterns.\n\nIMO, Math needs a rewrite to become more accessible.", "id": "c2se9rm"}, {"comment": "I agree that accessibility is immensely practical, and there is no doubt that readable and well-documented code is incredibly important in the development of large software projects. \n\nWhat you seem to imply, though, is that mathematical notation doesn't follow well-established patterns, and that math itself is not verbose, and I disagree with that. It's true that, in practice, mathematical formulas and notation are often  abbreviated and confusing to newcomers, but again, this is for the sake of clarity for those who understand it. Most often, as with the case of [\u211d](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number#Notation) and [~](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation#Notation) in the OP's example, the notation used is universally accepted convention. In the case of shorthand being used outside of convention, it is exceedingly rare (and generally bad form) to see it presented without verbose explanation beforehand, unless it is in a publication aimed at an audience where the shorthand *is* considered convention.\n\nConvention is precisely why I don't quite understand your suggestion. The conventional shorthand used in mathematical notation is essentially no different from using function calls within a program. Although the name of a function can impart important details to the reader about it's functionality and implementation, if the reader wants to know *exactly* how it works, they're going to have to look up the function definition. Similarly, a total code neophyte might not understand what exactly a while loop does. Does that mean that programmers should be required to thoroughly document every instance of one?\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that accessibility is a relative concept. What constitutes readability in code is not necessarily the same for mathematical notation. Aside from that, there is also value to and reasoning behind mathematical notation as it currently stands, which is what I was trying to get across with my previous post.\n\nI don't disagree with the view that higher-level mathematical notation can be inaccessible to the uninitiated, but I don't see how mathematical notation could practicably be entirely re-written without compromising its international clarity or its versatility. Not that I'm an expert, of course, and perhaps there are people attempting, or even succeeding at, just that. I'd welcome it wholeheartedly. I'm curious, though. If you were to try to make math more readable, how would you suggest it be done?

Specifically, I am writing this using comparisons to Pacific Southwestern American English. For a refresher, [this](http://web.ku.edu/~idea/northamerica/usa/california/california4.mp3) is how we talk out here.\n\nThe \"upside down e\" sound is called a schwa. There is no equivalent in Japanese, correct. However, in any instance where an English word is transliterated into Japanese, the English spelling is typically used as the basis for spelling in Japanese (exceptions occur when the schwa is at the end of the word). For example, the word \"bottle\" becomes \"botoru\", where \"o\" represents the schwa, but in the word \"about\", it becomes \"abauto\" (schwa remains \"a\" in Japanese). Establishing this, we can agree that there is no equivalent for the schwa in Japanese.\n\nHowever, in the video, the error in pronunciation is not occurring due to the missing empty vowel in words like \"w\u0259rk\". Using Japanese pronunciation conventions, he would either try to replace the \u0259 with either \"o\" (r**o**w) or \"u\" (**u**ber), resulting in either \"work\" (rhymes with \"dork\") or \"wurk\" (I couldn't think of a word. Maybe the **u** in \"Tuna?\"]). \n\nHowever, we do not hear either of these in the video. The closest phonetic representation I can muster is \"wook\" (remember, Pacific Southwestern American).

Perhaps Mandarin, Icelandic, or Hindi would be a good start. I doubt you'd be able to even tell what you were saying wrong when you said it because your brain has not developed the capability to pick up on those subtleties and even if it did your mouth would not have the muscle memory to pronounce them properly. Your examples seem easy to you from your ethnocentric perspective, but if you don't realize that you'd be equally lost with pronouncing things little kids who speak other languages find obvious, you're demonstrating quite a bit of ignorance.\n\nI would love for you to post a video of you trying to say or understand the differences that allow something like this [poem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WuvsN4VkRE) known as [The Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den) to be intelligible. Yes, it's a bit of a tongue twister, but even independently I doubt you'd get the inflections for the words anywhere close to right and from their point of view you'd seem like a fool who is partially deaf/dumb to what they consider obvious differences. Native Mandarin speakers would have no trouble understanding that the poem says by how the words sound, unlike an English sentence like [\"Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo) where all the words actually sound the same independently (are homophones) and the differences in the three types of words used are purely in terms of semantics as interpreted word order.", "id": "c2srwpq"}, {"comment": "I get what you're saying and agree.  But that's lightyears away from the situation we're discussing, with this dude's phone and my ex-girlfriend.  Both of them grew up in a world where English is EVERYWHERE, including millions of experiences with the sound of RRR.  Am I ignorant or racist to be pointing out that this is an ethnocentric world, for the English language?!  That's just the truth/reality...  \n  \nWhat I've encountered over and over and over amongst Japanese people is a near unwillingness to break out of their severe accent.  There's something going on that seems to nonconsciously insists on making other language's sounds conform to that constricted Japanese alphabet.  Don't know if the guy in this video is Japanese, but it sounds like the same issue/dynamic - just repeating the same mispronunciation like he can't even hear or comprehend what he's doing wrong.  In the various countries I've been in, I've often mispronounced something the first few times, but I listen more carefully and then make an effort to dial it in.  That has never failed.  I'm not claiming perfect accent by any means, but am claiming workable accent.  WAHK for WORRRK is not workable, and that word/sound is simple (again, considering that person almost certainly grew up with English all over the place - vs me who didn't grow up w/ Chinese 'shehr' sounds all around, or German glottals all around - because we don't live in that world).  \n  \n  ", "id": "c2ssn9r"}, {"comment": "Ignorance is briss.", "id": "c2srx5a"}]]], "lgixo": ["In a \"normal\" stall on campus", "2011-10-18 22:10:18", 95, "http://www.imgur.com/zH7XF.jpg", [[1, "HogimusPrime, is my sarcasm detector still malfunctioning?"], [1, "so true, they're too damn big...i need to be in a tiny pooping chamber or I feel too exposed"]], [[{"comment": "HogimusPrime, is my sarcasm detector still malfunctioning?", "id": "c2stmtx"}], [{"comment": "so true, they're too damn big...i need to be in a tiny pooping chamber or I feel too exposed", "id": "c2u8bm6"}]]], "lfhe9": ["Knowing the reddit community, I can't be the only one who thought this...", "2011-10-18 00:08:40", 406, "http://i.imgur.com/X9jbc.jpg", [[45, "I agree, my exact sentiment was: \n\n\"Oh you're gay??

Nevertheless, I would be remiss in my duties if I didn't add Paul Atreides to my ever-growing list of badasses.  Here's why:\n\n> * First off, Paul is the heir of one of the universe's most powerful ruling Houses and is fucking genetically-engineered to be a badass.  He's bred to be the freaking saviour of humanity as the Kwisatz Haderach, and he can fucking see the future and shit.  Which is awesome.  Plus, he's trained in military strategy and hardcore back-alley knife-fighting by Jean-Luc Picard, who also teaches him how to create weird CG box shields around himself, lumber around like Tom Green in a Sumo Wrestling Fatsuit and stab people in the throat.  Oh, and he learns martial arts somewhere in there too. \n\n> *  In order to test how fucking rad he is, some bitch makes Paul put his hand inside this box that melts his flesh off.  To make sure he's not a total pussy, she yells at him and says that if he pulls his hand out before he's supposed to he'll die immediately.  So Paul is just like, \"yeah whatever you stupid whore this doesn't hurt at all\" and just sits there while fucking ants eat his hands or something.  He just manages to mind-over-matter himself through it and acts like an emotional automaton while this crazy fucked-up box of mystery is doing all kinds of horrible shit to his hand.  Once the ritual is over, his hand goes back to normal and everyone realizes that he's tough as fucking nails. \n\n> *  He has cool hair. \n\n> *  When the shit hits the fan back at House Atreides, Paul and his mom haul ass through the sands of Arrakis, meeting up with the Fremen, who recognize Paul as being a total badass and make him their king.  He teaches them all how to kick ass and they all decide to be fanatically loyal to him until death even though they've only known him for a couple of days.  Shit, the Fremen chief is even like, \"damn Paul you're hardcore.  Why don't you fucking get it on with my daughter and have some awesome kids or some shit?\" \n\n> *  The Fremen give Paul two names;  Muad'Dib, which is like the name of the God of Living in the Desert, and Usul, which is a super-secret name which only one person can ever call him.  If anyone else calls him Usul, Paul is well within his rights to kill them immediately.  This is badass.  I can really only think of one other person with a super secret name like that, and that's Yahweh.  Yahweh is also badass. \n\n> *  When he gets all wigged out on spice, his eyes start glowing blue and people start exploding. \n\n> *  He rides around on hugeass sand worms that can swallow entire armies in one bite.  Shit, he doesn't even need a fucking saddle - he just uses a rope with hooks on either end and climbs on top of these giant man-eating beasts like they were the fucking twenty-five cent motorized horses outside of Target. \n\n> *  In the movie, he learns some crazy technique called the \"Weirding Way\", which lets him point a box at somebody, yell really loudly and make their body cavity explode.  His name is even a \"killing word\".  How fucking rad is that?  I wish I could just point a stapler at someone, yell my name really loudly and watch their heads cave in. \n\n> *  In the books, his crazy technique is actually an insane martial art that lets him zip around like The Motherfucking Flash and beat the holy living shit out of people.  The Fremen learn this art and use Muad'Dib's name as a \"killing prayer\", whispering the name into the ears of people who have just been stabbed in the face or had their necks broken and are on the verge of death.  That's also cool.  There's something badass about making sure that your name is the last thing that your enemies hear before they die. \n\n> *  When Sting shows up and starts acting all weird and shit with his stupid-looking hairless cat, Muad'Dib has a hardcore Beat It-style knife fight with him in the Harkkonen throne room.  Of course, Paul is awesome and knifes Sting to death. \n\n> *  Paul drinks that crazy Water of Life shit that killed like a million people before him but just ends up getting a really fucked-up acid trip out of it and waking up with a hangover.  While he's tripping balls he meets all of his dead ancestors and the Virgin Mary cries blood or something.  I couldn't really figure out what the fuck was going on in that scene. \n\n> *  He threatens to destroy all the Spice on Arrakis and effectively bring all civilization in the universe to a screeching halt unless the Emperor of the Universe (!!) steps down and lets Paul take over.  And the Emperor of the Universe agrees. \n\n> *  Basically after all this shit, everyone realizes Paul is fucking awesome so they built some sort of crazy cult around him and worship him like a god."], [7, "I will upvote anything remotely connected to Dune!

Frank Herbert was a brilliant man who gave us a lot to think about through his stories. Growing up, this book has had a major impact on my idea of mankind's place in the universe and how we look at the universe itself, adapt to our surroundings.\n\nThe Fremen are a beautiful representation of what mankind is going through. We used to live in squalor, drinking our own piss and generally being badass, but then we got our luxuries. We got lazy. We got water-fat.

Though Herbert compensates even further by injecting the books with a bunch of pseudo-philosophy from one of his robot characters (forgot the name).\n\nAs for House Corrino, I've forgotten most of the details, and the three 'House' books sort of blend together in my memory, but I do remember enjoying them in a guilty pleasure sort of way.

Once the ritual is over, his hand goes back to normal and everyone realizes that he's tough as fucking nails. \n\n> *  He has cool hair. \n\n> *  When the shit hits the fan back at House Atreides, Paul and his mom haul ass through the sands of Arrakis, meeting up with the Fremen, who recognize Paul as being a total badass and make him their king.  He teaches them all how to kick ass and they all decide to be fanatically loyal to him until death even though they've only known him for a couple of days.  Shit, the Fremen chief is even like, \"damn Paul you're hardcore.  Why don't you fucking get it on with my daughter and have some awesome kids or some shit?\" \n\n> *  The Fremen give Paul two names;  Muad'Dib, which is like the name of the God of Living in the Desert, and Usul, which is a super-secret name which only one person can ever call him.  If anyone else calls him Usul, Paul is well within his rights to kill them immediately.  This is badass.  I can really only think of one other person with a super secret name like that, and that's Yahweh.  Yahweh is also badass. \n\n> *  When he gets all wigged out on spice, his eyes start glowing blue and people start exploding. \n\n> *  He rides around on hugeass sand worms that can swallow entire armies in one bite.  Shit, he doesn't even need a fucking saddle - he just uses a rope with hooks on either end and climbs on top of these giant man-eating beasts like they were the fucking twenty-five cent motorized horses outside of Target. \n\n> *  In the movie, he learns some crazy technique called the \"Weirding Way\", which lets him point a box at somebody, yell really loudly and make their body cavity explode.  His name is even a \"killing word\".  How fucking rad is that?  I wish I could just point a stapler at someone, yell my name really loudly and watch their heads cave in. \n\n> *  In the books, his crazy technique is actually an insane martial art that lets him zip around like The Motherfucking Flash and beat the holy living shit out of people.  The Fremen learn this art and use Muad'Dib's name as a \"killing prayer\", whispering the name into the ears of people who have just been stabbed in the face or had their necks broken and are on the verge of death.  That's also cool.  There's something badass about making sure that your name is the last thing that your enemies hear before they die. \n\n> *  When Sting shows up and starts acting all weird and shit with his stupid-looking hairless cat, Muad'Dib has a hardcore Beat It-style knife fight with him in the Harkkonen throne room.  Of course, Paul is awesome and knifes Sting to death. \n\n> *  Paul drinks that crazy Water of Life shit that killed like a million people before him but just ends up getting a really fucked-up acid trip out of it and waking up with a hangover.  While he's tripping balls he meets all of his dead ancestors and the Virgin Mary cries blood or something.  I couldn't really figure out what the fuck was going on in that scene. \n\n> *  He threatens to destroy all the Spice on Arrakis and effectively bring all civilization in the universe to a screeching halt unless the Emperor of the Universe (!!) steps down and lets Paul take over.  And the Emperor of the Universe agrees. \n\n> *  Basically after all this shit, everyone realizes Paul is fucking awesome so they built some sort of crazy cult around him and worship him like a god.", "id": "c2sp5g9"}, {"comment": "Not sure if this guy is trolling or if he sincerely believes he got the story right.

Atheist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Scientologist, etc. We can all agree this is a tad ridiculous and saying something it didn't intend\n\nI remember along time ago I worked on an embedded x86 system. It had some real mode code and protected mode code. It could run Dos for testing.\n\nIn particular int 0xff was hooked by a protected mode virtual machine manager. It allowed you to do things like write to the page table and thus map memory above 1MB into the 1MB real mode address space. Int 0xff didn't actually do anything in real mode. In fact the ISR didn't even point anywhere. So if you wanted to see if the VMM was actually there you needed to set up a dummy ISR. Then you'd call int 0xff with the right parameters to see if protected mode code took over. If it didn't - because it hadn't been loaded  - your real mode ISR would stop the machine from hanging. You'd print a message and exit.\n\nBut if the VMM was running you'd see the results of the page table changing.\n\nNow here's the point. Real mode code that didn't know about protected mode code would think that int 0xff didn't do anything.

If 40,000 people witnessing something does not constitute proof (which it does in fact not), no number of witnesses does.\n\nWorse, the very thing making it somewhat believable (that the Astonomers and Observatories nearby that should've witnessed the event did not) puts a final nail in the coffin of the event being proven to be anything at all.\n\n> Your idea of the blood would still fail to convince most people, it's gotta be something like messing around with things in the sky, giving us a few extra moons (even then it might just be aliens! But if those aliens are doing that I think we have more important things to worry about than god). Until that happens (any day now!), the debate is decidedly undecided in my mind, and that's fine with me.\n\nI'm talking proof, not convincing.  You can convince someone that gravity doesn't exist, but you can prove it does by measuring it. Ditto with cats, by providing taxidermy, blood and hair samples, actual live specimens heavily tested.\n\nI don't think any miracle (assuming a real miracle could happen) would be able to prove anything about the divine.  This, more than anything, is why belief or unbelief boils down to faith.  \"Prove god exists\" is like saying \"prove laughter is green\".  It is a useless statement that gets nobody anywhere.  There is no measurable phenomenon that can be tested against to claim the existence or non-presence of god.  The very nature of things people believe God is capable of make those things either impossible to prove, or impossible to link to the divine.  \n\nIf one day I flapped my arms and flew onto the roof, and 100 people witnessed it, I could not prove I had done it, unless I could repeat it (repetition has always been a tough cookie for all religions) *and* it could be measured in some way.  Without measuring it, any witness (including the camera) could be hallucinating/malfunctioning.", "id": "c2sg2bc"}, {"comment": "I try my best.", "id": "c2sac9o"}, {"comment": "Of course not everything we do is rational, but there's a difference between not rationalizing something and flat-out *refusing* to rationalize something.

In exchange for this support the pope crowned Charlemagne as the Roman emperor, despite the Roman empire still existing in the east.
