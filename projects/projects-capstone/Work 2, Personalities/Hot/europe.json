One group which attempted to get a libertarian perspective on the situation was Mujeres Libres (Free Women). By the end of September 1936 it had seven Labour Sections - Transport, Public Services, Nursing, Clothing, Mobile Brigades for non-specialists, and brigades able to substitute for men needed in the war.(12) The federation grew, organising for women to make the maximum contribution to whatever practical work had to be done. Its members saw themselves as having an important educational function, working to emancipate women from the traditional passivity, ignorance and exploitation that enslaved them, and towards a teal understanding between men and women, who would work together without excluding each other. They saw a need to awaken women to vital consciousness of their movement, and convince them that isolated and purely feminine activity was now impossible. They saw themselves as based on comprehensive human aspirations for emancipation, realisable only in social revolution, which would liberate women from the stagnation of mediocrity.\n\nPolitically, the slogans of Mujeres Libres described the situation simply as a struggle between two classes and two ideologies: labour against privilege; liberty against dictatorship. It was to prove rather more complicated. The characteristic anarchist mixture of high-flown rhetoric, sketchy theory and intensive practical activity did not match up to the exigencies of grim political reality, despite the real achievements of the group under difficult conditions.\n\nDefence of Madrid \nOf course, the Nationalist threat was forcibly present, providing at first a stimulus as well as menace to revolutionary action, as people took the fight against it in their own hands. The stand made for Madrid against the Nationalist army in early November 1936 renewed the spirit of the immediate response to the military rising, and again women played as great a part as in the first days of the war. A women's battalion fought before Segovia Bridge. At Gestafe, in the centre of the northern front, women were under fire all morning and were among the last to leave. In the retreat to Madrid, occasional militia women were to be seen - some more soldierly in appearance than the men, others neat, groomed and made-up, a male observer noted. (13) With the Italians of the International Column in Madrid was a sixteen-year-old girl from Ciudad Real, who had joined up after her father and brother were killed. She had the same duties as men, shared their way of life, and was said to be a crack shot,\n\nInside the city, women organised mass demonstrations, devised propaganda and slogans including the famous \"No Paseran\" (\"They Shall Not Pass\", accredited to La Pasionara), and built barricades, often with 'the help of children and sometimes under fire. Committees were set up based on districts, houses and blocks, for the provision of food, ammunition and communications. Women contributed actively to the defence, including anti-aircraft observation, and surveillance of fifth- column suspects. Their committees organised collective meals and laundry; the creches and maternity homes set up between July and October carried on as best they could. Brou\u00e9 and T\u00e9mime have described the spread of House and Neighbourhood Committees as amounting to a second Madrid Revolution, the basis of a genuine Commune.\n\nSimultaneously, women often had to bear the brunt of hardship, risking violation of the curfew regulations which barred them from the streets before 6 a.m., in order to get a good place in queues for food (the first place the next day went to those not served). Wives were told that they must be ready to take the men's lunches not to the factories but to the trenches. (14) Working-class women carried hot meals to the barricades. More middle-class women ran soup kitchens for refugees and first-aid stations for victims of fifth-column sniping.\"", "id": "daqd5p7"}, {"comment": "So your proposal is to name them streets after a working class women that carried hot meals to the barricades and the likes.\n\nNo women Spanish scientists or of that level of importance?\n\nCool.", "id": "daqhmv2"}, {"comment": "You can't read or Google can you?

Some details are found [here](https://euobserver.com/foreign/135022). The proposal is in fact backed [by France, Germany, Italy and Spain](https://www.ft.com/content/ddad201e-50c9-36fc-b694-8e9522fb9323). \n\nAfter the last council meeting, it was decided that the proposed HQ will only be established for \"non-executive\" missions. I take it that these are missions not directly related to combat. This is because the EU needed to [agree on](http://www.politico.eu/article/eu-backs-greater-military-cooperation-nato-donald-trump-federica-mogherini/) allowing \"Permanent Structured Co-operation\" and the UK didn't like the idea of a full military-civilian HQ.\n\n>One of the proposals is a new EU military headquarters that is still opposed by London. But even on that point, the U.K. expressed flexibility, provided it is used only for civilian missions, or so-called non-executive missions, Fallon said. \n\nThis doesn't mean the EU cannot engage in such missions, only that it needs to set-up an HQ for each one, just like it does now. Once the UK leaves this will most likely be revised.\n\nWhat we are left with an EU that is pushing for *allowing* deeper defense and security integration ([Council conclusions on implementing the EU global strategy in the area of security and defence](http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/11/14-conclusions-eu-global-strategy-security-defence/) within the context of the EU, in particular but not exclusively in areas outside of NATO's competence. \n\nAll of this has a two-speed Europe in mind. The Franco-German proposal is, in my view, the most likely result for those member states who wish to participate in defense integration. This is the driver behind all the recent defence-related news coming out of Brussels, in particular the decision by the Council to allow permanent structured co-operation I linked to above, as well as this weeks' news about increased defense spending.\n\nEdit: FT article in full:\n\n>Italy and Spain have rowed in behind France and Germany in their push for closer European defence co-operation, calling for the creation of autonomous EU bodies to take charge of common military operations.\n\n>In a letter sent on Tuesday night to their EU counterparts, the defence ministers of the four countries said the uncertainties presented by Brexit and Europe\u2019s \u201cdegraded\u201d security environment demanded a strengthening of the bloc\u2019s defence capacity.\n\n>They insisted an \u201cEU army\u201d was not their objective and said there was no clash with Nato activities, adding that unnecessary duplication should be avoided.\n\n>With Britain on its way out of the EU, European officials believe an opportunity has opened up to fortify the bloc\u2019s own defence operations.\n\n>The proposals backed by Italy and Spain build on a Franco-German position paper of September in which they called for a new military headquarters and shared assets.\n\n>Citing previous EU operations in Mali, Somalia and Congo, the ministers said the EU will in future \u201cmost probably have to launch missions of military and/or civilian character in regions Nato does not consider taking action.\u201d\n\n>Even though London has already signaled resistance to greater EU military integration, the ministers urged the UK \u201cto accompany us as closely as possible.\u201d Britain will continue to provide a significant contribution to the security of Europe through Nato, they added.\nThe letter \u2014 seen by the FT \u2014 comes after Federica Mogherini, EU foreign policy chief, asked member states to define the \u201clevel of ambition\u201d to guide a new drive to deepen defence coordination in Europe.\n\n>\u201cOn the one hand, we should enhance the EU\u2019s ability to autonomously assess and evaluate its security environment and to take the initiative by launching military operations from low to high intensity levels,\u201d the ministers said.\n\n>\u201cOn the other hand, we need to consolidate a European defence industrial and technological base able to manage key defence technologies, provide the future military capability necessary to the European defence reinforce our decision-making autonomy.\u201d\nThe letter was signed by Jean-Yves Le Drian of France, Ursula von der Leyen of Germany, Roberta Pinotti of Italy and Pedro Morenes of Spain.\n\n>Although they do not add new operational proposals to the original Paris-Berlin paper, the involvement of Rome and Madrid provides fresh impetus at a time when several proposals to boost European defence are under discussion.\n\n>EU member states already engage in limited military cooperation but deeper integration has long been opposed by Britain, which warns against the wasteful duplication of activities reserved for Nato, and by neutral member states.\n\n>Poland and Slovakia have privately questioned the push to fortify EU defence activities and there are political concerns in neutral countries such as Austria and Ireland. Still, the four ministers said they wanted to implement their proposals at the level of 28 member states \u201cor, with respect to the Brexit decision, at 27.\u201d \n\nEdit2:\n\nI'm a bit confused regarding the \"non-executive\" mission part. I took the politico quote for granted before, but after having looked into it a bit it seems taht \"non-executive\" should be taken a bit more literally, i.e. a non-executive mission means that some government/governmental body coordinates/aids in efforts but is not the body that executes orders (or gives orders, in the strict military sense).

Coupled with increased defense spending, this of course means that we can drastically increase the amount of money each member state can spend on their capabilities. \n\nIf we also manage to pull off workable EU battlegroups as proposed,  which requires some kind of \"executive mission\" HQ, then we even get an EU force that might be called an embyrionic army.

The U.S. is Germany\u2019s largest trading partner, accounting for almost 10% of all German exports, according to Germany\u2019s state statistical office.\n\n\u201cIf Trump can enact the trade limits he has announced, the damage would be substantial,\u201d said Clemens Fuest, president of Germany\u2019s Ifo Institute for Economic Research.

My own views are advanced from a secular point of view where humans are not reliable actors in society. I do not appreciate \"moral crusading\" either, but I'm willing to engage in a earnest debate about the intellectual and practical merit of various ideas and policies. I think you can also have a discussion on morality in the same way though. Regarding the care of the elderly, this is not mutually exclusive with other activities, so I don't think it's fair to paint my point about sacrifice and obligations as inconsistent with it. There is no life threatening sacrifices to cleaning a old person's body, or making them food, or doing their laundry. It's not the same as [this](http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/05/31/japan.nuclear.suicide/index.html).

But when it comes to the fetuses in abortion cases, they almost always could have developed to their full potential as an adult human.\n\nThe difference is that fetus are potential life without contentiousness, whereas people in coma are actual living persons who already effected their environment with their distinct observable inner and/or outer features and therefore the emotional connection is different. There are just abstract ways to experience a fetus in its early development and that is why there is no inconsistency just a logical one, but human morals are based on emotions and sentiments, that why humans tend to value the direct experiencable  over the potential.\n\n>I think there are logically consistent viewpoints for many combinations of these views, personally.\n\nConsistence is certainly something worth to aim for, but its hard if not impossible to be consistent when two different (or even more) topics  meet in one phenomenon which is the case when it comes to abortion. However the second dimension of abortion is the effect on the mothers life. Something you just  fob off because of your focus on life and you conviction that life is life regardless of its consciousness its state of development or tangibility, actually that is the very questions about the ethics of abortion, when does human life start? What to value more and how to evaluate a fetus in comparison to the influence on the mothers life. And your arguments are just a more sophisticated repetitions/alterations of the same tune and so are mine. You choose the life aspect over the emancipatory aspect and I choose vice versa.  \nThe emancipatory  dimension manifest chiefly in the negative consequences of the pregnancy and motherhood which are myriad and have a huge potential to disadvantage women over men and even effect them regardless if they decide to give the child up for adoption or not. If you aim for consistence in  how you evaluate life in general than there is the potential that you sacrifice the gender-specific distinct features of abortion and there you create an inconsistency in this topic. Also its apparent that the evaluation of abortion highly depends  on the individual believe of when human-life starts, its not like that there is an hard scientific evidence, but as your posts has shown the dominance of morals and perspectives. \nThe question therefor is also why should the moral perspective of one group influence the actions of the other group, even-though the second group is the one who has also live with the consequences, which highly effect their lives, how do you justify  that  one moral conviction (and therefor subjective perspective or emphasis  regardless of how consistent it is) to dominate the other? But when if you turn it around the first group only has to live with feeling that something is wrong about what other people do but there is no direct effect on their lives, because they can just relinquish from the possibility to abort and therefor live in consistency with their personal conscience and what other group do is just an offense against their personal (very subjective) moral beliefs, without further effect on their lives. \n\n Its a very complex topic and our discussion is the very proof that it hugely depends on what you value over the other and when you think human-life starts.  \nIts like the Trolley-Problem in which different ethical ways of thinking produce different beliefs of what is the right thing to do. \n\n\n", "id": "dar8vkf"}, {"comment": "> Its more complex than that, because it ignores grey areas, like rape or dangers for the mother, to define these matters as selfish is just wrong, self-preservation is not selfish but the most natural thing.\n\nI would advocate abortion in all of these cases but it's still a very selfish choice.

Lysenko served as the director of the Soviet Union's Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Lysenkoism began in the late 1920s and formally ended in 1964.

Now the Kremlin is investing in academic kooks and conspiracies.\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 The award ceremony had all the trappings of legitimacy: a trendy loft venue not far from the Kremlin; a rapturous, inquisitive, and mostly young audience; and a jury made up of top scientific minds.\n\nThe prize at stake, however, was not about whose research had been the most cutting-edge or who had made the greatest contribution to Russian science that year. The jury, instead, was charged with determining who had been most successful in \u201cbringing the light of ignorance to the masses.\u201d Those voting cast their ballots into a tin-foil hat.\n\nIn the end, October\u2019s inaugural \u201chonorary member of the pseudoscience academy\u201d award went to Irina Yermakova, a biologist and regular commentator on Russian national television. Yermakova is on the record as believing that men, as a sex, evolved from early hermaphrodite Amazonians. She\u2019s one of Russia\u2019s leading anti-GMO campaigners, claiming that genetically modified foods are actually an American bioweapon aimed at committing genocide against Russia. In handing her the award, Russia\u2019s scientific community was seeking to demonstrate that, even in trying times, it hasn\u2019t lost its sense of humor. The event organizer, Alexander Sokolov, a science journalist and award-winning author, issued a defiant proclamation from the stage: \u201cLet as many people as possible see that science is alive in Russia and that it can defend itself!\u201d\n\nExcept there\u2019s growing evidence it can\u2019t.\n\nScience is under assault in the land that has produced some 17 Nobel Prize winners in the sciences. It\u2019s not just that funding has been slashed (though it has) or that the field struggles with corruption and brain drain (though it does). Members of the scientific community say one of the biggest issues they face is the recent embrace of pseudoscientists like Yermakova by the Russian state. The Kremlin has elevated and institutionalized their ideas, often mixing them with a healthy dose of anti-Western rhetoric for good measure.\n\nYermakova, for example, in addition to her TV spots, has appeared as an expert before the Russian parliament, where populist lawmakers use her to back up their case against genetically modified foods. \u201cRussia has been pressured into GMO after its accession to the [World Trade Organization],\u201d majority party member of parliament Yevgeny Fedorov told state channel Rossiya 24 in 2014 in words that echoed Yermakova\u2019s views. \u201cThis is political pressure; its goal is to create risks of sterilization\u201d to shrink the Russian population, he said. Russia passed a law in July banning production of genetically modified foods, despite repeated protests by the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nOther believers in fringe pseudoscience who have been elevated to positions of authority include Mikhail Kovalchuk, a physicist from Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle who presides over the Kurchatov Institute, a nuclear energy research institution. Last year (the same day Moscow began its bombing campaign in Syria), Kovalchuk gave a presentation to Russian senators warning that the global elite, overseen by the United States, is developing a special human subspecies \u2014 a genetically different caste of laboring \u201cservant people\u201d who eat little, think small, and reproduce only on command. (Buried beneath the wacky conspiracy theory and anti-Western hyperbole was a lobbying pitch for more state funding so that his institute could stay ahead of the curve on groundbreaking research.)\n\nIn some cases, these figures have already done real damage. Kovalchuk is one of Putin\u2019s top science advisors, a veteran senior member of his science council who is also the brother of Yuri Kovalchuk, a man the U.S. government has called the \u201cpersonal banker\u201d to senior Russian officials. Kovalchuk\u2019s connections were expected to make him an eventual shoo-in for Russia\u2019s top academic post as president of the Academy of Sciences. The academy\u2019s membership, which selects both members and leaders in democratic votes, unexpectedly resisted Kovalchuk, however; his bid to become a full member of the academy, a requirement to head it, was rejected in 2008.\n\nThis and other moves by the academy to reject Kovalchuk are believed to have led to a backlash in 2013, when the Russian government moved to dismantle the institution: It took away most of the academy\u2019s property, diluted its ranks by combining it with the less rigorous agriculture and medical academies, and curbed its independence, subjecting it to the supervision of a newly created state agency for scientific organizations. The reforms have done \u201cgreat damage\u201d to the academy, an institution that dates back to the 18th century and serves as the nerve center for a network of Russian scientific institutions, said science journalist Alexander Sergeyev. They\u2019ve buried scientists in paperwork and subjected them to the control of non-scientists. Meanwhile, Kovalchuk\u2019s Kurchatov Institute is becoming increasingly powerful and has assumed control over some of the academy\u2019s research centers.\n\nBelievers in, and peddlers of, pseudoscience now occupy positions throughout the Russian government. Anton Vaino, Putin\u2019s virtually unknown chief of staff, who was elevated to the post in August, published academic work in 2012 on the \u201cnooscope,\u201d a baffling mystical instrument that he claims can forecast and control society and the economy by scanning the universe. The Kremlin\u2019s ombudswoman for children, Anna Kuznetsova, appointed in September, reportedly believes in telegony \u2014 the archaic theory that a woman\u2019s child bears the traits of all her past sexual partners. \u201cSuch people in power is a new trend that shows that the authorities are no longer afraid of people that are overt carriers of pseudoscientific ideas,\u201d Sergeyev said. \u201cOn the contrary, the authorities are ready to accept them and to be under their influence.\u201d\n\nThe Russian government\u2019s seeming vendetta against legitimate science is no coincidence, critics say. The Kremlin has discovered that pseudoscience fits its present ideological needs.\n\nIn September, the academy\u2019s special commission to fight Russian pseudoscience published a report that found that its rise was in part tied to the country\u2019s growing isolation and nationalism. Russians who reject global scientific norms have treated this ideological shift as an opportunity to lobby for government support for their projects. The report concluded that unscientific ideas and projects have thrived in recent years in part by \u201cspeculating on pro-regime ideologies.\u201d Kovalchuk, for example, has theorized that Russia could stay ahead of Western science by funding an undefined field he calls \u201cconvergent technologies\u201d; another argument, currently popular in Russia, is that established methods for fighting the spread of HIV, such as condom use, are in fact an American tool to weaken Russia. \u201cThe pseudo-patriotic rhetoric that surrounds these para-scientific topics allows their lobbyists to rise to a level far higher than their competence,\u201d the academy\u2019s report said.\n\nMeanwhile, the growing link between nationalism and pseudoscience has allowed pseudoscientists to accuse their critics of being unpatriotic Russophobes. Anatole Klyosov, a Russian biochemist who worked in the United States before veering off into genetics, last year opened a Moscow-based \u201cacademy\u201d for DNA genealogy, a field he claims to have discovered and upholds as a \u201cpatriotic science.\u201d In the 10 books he has published since 2010, Klyosov has advanced outlandish claims, including the idea that the human species originated in the Russian North and that the view that humans derived from Africa is an expression of Western political correctness.\n\nIn 2015, a group of scientists from various fields wrote an open letter saying Klyosov\u2019s writing could fuel hatred by \u201cattracting readers whose nationalist and political ambitions are not satisfied with the world\u2019s scientific body of knowledge.\u201d Klyosov responded in his latest book, which he called Lies, Insinuations, and Russophobia in Modern Russian Science, dismissing his critics as members of a \u201cfifth column.\u201d\n\nIn addition to creating a climate that supports pseudoscience, the Kremlin seems to be making efforts to cut off legitimate Russian researchers from the outside world, said Sergeyev, who is part of the academy\u2019s pseudoscience-fighting commission. Whispers last year indicated some universities are reviving the Soviet-era requirement that administrators vet scholarly papers before publication while others have imposed a ban on professors giving interviews without first receiving permission.\n\nRussia has a mixed historical legacy when it comes to science policy. Science in the Soviet Union enjoyed relative prestige, especially fields that had applications for the military, space, and nuclear research. Students, beginning from a young age, were encouraged to pursue physics and mathematics in particular (the country\u2019s proud stock of Nobel laureates and Fields medalists attests to the success of those efforts), and universities headhunted promising students to work in secret government labs in relatively comfortable conditions.\n\nBut the country has also long been susceptible to the potent combination of political power and pseudoscience. Research on an idea known as the Torsion field theory, for instance \u2014 which claimed to be able to explain telekinesis and levitation, among other phenomena \u2014 secretly received funding from the Soviet military and the KGB in the 1980s despite rejecting basic principles of physics.", "id": "dapgh78"}, {"comment": "The darkest example of state support for pseudoscience comes from the period between the 1930s and the 1960s. That was the heyday of a biologist named Trofim Lysenko, who became a darling of Joseph Stalin.\n\nLysenko was everything the dictator wanted in a scientist: a plain-spoken man from a peasant family, eager to put science to work for the people. Appointed to head the Soviet agricultural academy in 1938, Lysenko went on to set Soviet science and agriculture back decades by promoting baseless ideas, including methods for transforming rye into barley, and insisting that schools reject Mendelian genetics.\n\nWhat might have been a scientific debate between geneticists and agronomists like Lysenko who rejected natural selection turned into something else entirely with Stalin\u2019s overt support for the latter. The government amplified Lysenko\u2019s slander against his opponents (state media discredited geneticists as \u201cmisanthropic fruit fly lovers,\u201d proponents of eugenics and imperialism), and hundreds of Russian scientists who challenged his ideas were sidelined, exiled, or killed. The most famous victim of what came to be called Lysenkoism was Russian ethnobotanist Nikolai Vavilov, who dedicated his life to eradicating famine and created the world\u2019s largest collection of plant seeds in St. Petersburg. Vavilov came to be highly critical of Lysenko\u2019s ideas, however, and as a result was labeled a traitor and died in prison in 1943.\n\nLysenkoism was summarily discredited, and the taboo on genetics discarded in the 1970s and 1980s, after the departure of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, a Lysenko supporter. Meanwhile, Vavilov\u2019s name now graces several prestigious Russian institutes, including the Institute of General Genetics in Moscow. In recent years, however, Lysenko has crept back into the realm of respectability, riding on the coattails of the rehabilitation of Stalin himself.\n\nIn 2014, a book that was at least partially sponsored by a state grant from the Ministry of Communications \u2014 titled Two Worlds, Two Ideologies \u2014 represented the argument between Lysenko and opponents as one between \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cnational traitors.\u201d Articles praising Lysenko appear regularly today in national newspapers: One 2015 article in the newspaper Kultura erroneously said, \u201cAgricultural methods developed by the academic are still used in the entire world.\u201d It continued: \u201cIf one were to analyze facts objectively, one would have to say that Lysenko was without question an extraordinary man.\u201d\n\n\u201cPseudoscience exists in all countries, but it is like cancerous cells: A healthy organism rejects them and does not let them grow,\u201d said Svetlana Borinskaya, a geneticist who works at the Institute of General Genetics. \u201cA sick organism is not able to react.\u201d There are signs in Russia that the cancer is taking hold: An annual study by the Higher School of Economics, a research university in Moscow, found in 2015 that the number of Russians who felt that science and technology bring more harm than good was 23 percent. The ratio of positive to negative views of science places Russia 30th out of 31 countries in a ranking of how much they value scientific progress; the study called it a \u201cworrying signal.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven educated people are starting to talk about reptilians that have taken over and are plotting in the world government,\u201d Borinskaya said. The influence of such ideas on Russian society has been strong enough that one news website, Gazeta.ru, has created a special subsection in its science department called \u201cObscurantism\u201d to expose fake science. \u201cPseudoscience and obscurantism harm real researchers and harm the public,\u201d said Gazeta.ru\u2019s science editor, Pavel Kotlyar. \u201cThey harm the elderly babushkas who absorb the nonsense about various health gadgets and water filters.\u201d\n\nRussian scientists have begun to fight back. In addition to the pseudoscience academy award and several independent popular science projects, a group of online vigilantes has been exposing widespread fraud in Russian Ph.D. dissertations since 2013 as part of a project called Dissernet. The practice is widespread in the social sciences, Andrei Rostovtsev, one of Dissernet\u2019s founders, told me. The fake dissertations are then defended in corrupt dissertation councils in what amounts to a vast criminal business that has impaired entire fields, particularly economics.\n\nMany of these fraudulent dissertations were produced by people who go on to become parliamentarians, Rostovtsev said. Others serve the Kremlin as politically convenient \u201cexperts\u201d: After Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 went down over eastern Ukraine in July 2014, for instance, Moscow brought out of them, Ivan Andriyevsky, on state television to back up its theory that MH17 had been shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet. Andriyevsky showed a crudely altered satellite image of a plane to a reporter as evidence. A few days later, Dissernet looked into his dissertation and found that 17 of 26 pages in the work on Russia\u2019s defense industry, for which he received a Ph.D. in economics, had been copy-pasted from other work, with heavy plagiarism on most of the other pages as well.\n\nRostovtsev describes Dissernet as a symbolic tool for Russia\u2019s legitimate research community to maintain its reputation and build solidarity but doubts it will help hold any Russian officials directly accountable. The same is likely true for the academy\u2019s pseudoscience award, whose trophy shows a sad reptilian creature posing like The Thinker and sitting atop an Egyptian pyramid. A few days after the pseudoscience ceremony, I called the organizer, Sokolov, to ask if Irina Yermakova had yet to collect it. She had not.\n\n\nBy Maria Antonova", "id": "dapgi1a"}, {"comment": "Thank you.\nVery obnoxious website on mobile. ", "id": "daqf8s1"}], [{"comment": "That is a shame.

First, it would require Reddit and other sites that host user-submitted content to *proactively* filter anything that might be subject to copyright. So, for example, if you upload someone else's photo, or submit a poem as a text post, Reddit could be held liable for hosting it. Second, it introduces ancillary copyright, which covers thumbnails and text snippets accompanying links like you see on Reddit, Twitter or Facebook. There isn't an EU-wide \"fair use\" exception to copyright law, which they would otherwise fall under, and this law only further cements that.\n\nThen there is also the recent ECJ ruling that basically states that linking to copyrighted content without permission is illegal from for-profit web sites, where \"for-profit\" can be as little as running ads to cover some of your operating costs.\n\nThe lawmakers and industry lobbyists who have been pushing this law have said that they won't target social media like Twitter or Facebook, \"only\" Google, however that doesn't mean that law won't apply to the former as well, and there is nothing that would stop them from changing their mind. The \"chilling effect\" it would create is very real, as in such cases of uncertainty, lawyers generally like to be on the safe side.\n\nDownvoting and excluding stuff from /r/all doesn't apply here, as the content is still present on the site. The argument that \"this was downvoted to oblivion\" won't hold in court.\n\nIronically, there are technical means to block the use of thumbnails and text snippets on external sites.

There's a huge proliferation of such sites because it's an [incredibly profitable business for the creators](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/fake-news-writer-paul-horner-thinks-he-got-trump-elected-2016-11), and such profitability can only occur if there's a hysterical demand for it.

So as long as the migrants were compatible with our values and as long as they contributed to the society I would not mind about them. And by contributing to the society I mean working and paying taxes. And no, they don't all have to be doctors and rocket scientists, however I would be very sceptical of migrants with little to no education at all regardless of their skin colour. It's just that the ratio of people with very poor education happens to be the biggest in developing African and Asian countries. \n\nIf you're asking about the general public reaction, it would depend a lot on whether they were muslim or not. A lot of the \"racism\" and \"xenophobia\" in CEE is actually islamophobia, which from my point of view is not completely unreasonable. Racism against gypsies is widespread, that's true, but it's also not completely black and white, since it Roma people often fail to integrate pretty much in all European countries.\n\nI wouldn't say that racism towards all non-white people is that prevalent. We have a quite big Vietnamese community and they're pretty much accepted. Prague is nowadays at 15% foreigners, including people of different colours, and there are little tensions.\n\nThe attitudes of people in small towns and villages would be more hostile though.\n\nI understand your point though and I'm not saying that there are no racists in the CEE. There are for sure people who feel themselves superior to Blacks/Asians. I was definitely not trying to claim that we're a tolerant paradise while the UK is a racist hellhole. I was just responding to the question of the OP and while I do realize that a huge influx of migrants would create some negative reactions in this region as well, I did not find it relevant to the original OP's question.", "id": "dangc50"}, {"comment": "Right I'm back. First off wanna thank you to being the second person to actually get my point. Funny how (judging foolishly by flairs) the person who didn't get my point was a \"fellow brit\". Why I understand OPs question I choose not to answer because I feel its more important that I dont want someone to assume or think that the British people as a whole dislike EEs or CEs, even though I know you don't think that in general but I feel to smell a slight odour of it. \n\nI won't restate my point since im happy you got it. But you said something which is bloody spot on. \"The attitudes of people in small towns and villages would be more hostile though.\" - This is what happened to EEs and CEs in the UK. Not saying London is a paradise by any means but those in the small less economically benefitted towns have had the biggest \"shift\" in their communities by influx of european immigration and thus have had the greatest change to them. This has caused a LOT of friction. One has to remember most of these places who did voted to leave Brexit (most) are the ones which throughout history have been fucked the most by successive governments and always get the scraps of pile. I would honestly compare it to Germany pre second world war where Jews and polish (not exclusively) were blamed for \"this country is shit because of them grrr\". When people are in a bad mental state already and don't have a good environment for propagation of freedom or great thoughts i.e they are swimming in shit, they get angry and bitter and look for a way out. \n\nInstead of working hard and pulling themselves out of the cesspit (some do) they look for reasons to blame as to why theyre in that place. It not my fault its other people etc. Eastern europeans were the perfect scape goat. In a service based country which ruined its industry in the thatcher era EEs were a fucking gold mine. Mostly educated CHEAP labour hard working? No contest. Sadly after the baby boomer generation a good chunk of the UK and its population has become intoxicated on the social welfare standard (you owe me a living). When people came along who did not think like this it threatened their way of a lax life. Globalisation is a bitch huh. Cue the garbage media and their owners latching onto this resentment milking it for the udders (EEs claim benefits, claim NHS benefits etc) and people got madder and madder. Why are these people getting things \"for free\" when they just came here? When we've been here since birth and we get nothing? - General sentiment. \n\nThe problem occurred when people who can't really think for themselves start being spoonfed propaganda by the shovel full.  EEs get this EEs get that. Just because a couple handful of people abuse the system (Brits do it too) doesn't mean its their fault, its the fault of a garbage system being riddled with loopholes which allows it to happen. Don't want to get robbed? Lock your door. This is the essential piece. \"locking of the door\" or in other words cut off from the EU - Brexit. The sad part is some people after voting OUT actually claimed they didnt know why they voted out and just did it because they thought people would vote in the majority for in. And also you got to remember a LOT of people who could vote did not vote because they were not given the correct facts. There was garbage propaganda from everywhere and sadly the british aren't too used to thinking with a clear head and only see what they wanna see (when in a badmood but hey who is). Ye i guess its an island mentality we have and sadly Ill be the first to admit too many of us have an arachaic garbage superiority complex which we need to divorce from as fast as possible. All this \"they're only coming here for 'our\" benefits and money\". We've been through a lot of shit post war. \n\nBut dont think that out of that 52% 100% of them have a resentment for EEs, its not true. Yea some do. But some just despise the despots in Brussels which personally sicken me too. How a group of unelected people can dare talk about and discuss lawful changes to politics in relation to a country it has no ties to is kinda messed up but hey. \n\nFor what its worth I voted to stay in cause i couldnt give a flying fuck what language someone speaks or who comes to this country.

But de 'trollkelder' is a well known beer bar with a large selection.\n\nAs for beers: it's hard to recommend beause it depends on what you like. Which is also the best thing about Belgian beers: there's a huge variety. Tripel, dubbel, quadrupel, abbey beers, geuze, kriek, etc.\n\nI'll try to cover a few of the basics:\n\n1. Every bar/caf\u00e9 will have 1 pils beer on tap. Almost always Jupiler, Stella or Maes. These are the low alcohol drinking beers (4.8%).\n\n2. Aside from the pils, Duvel is probably the most popular beer in Belgium. It's a fairly strong blond beer (8.5%), Pretty standard blond beer.\n\n3. Trappist. These are brewed by Cistercian monks. My personal favorite for the blond beers is the Westmalle trippel. Fairly strong, yeasty flavor.\n\n4. Also trappist: Regularly voted as the best beer in the world is the Westvleteren XII. It's also very hard to get because the monks brewing it make just enough to live their lives and don't care about profits. So they refuse to make more. However, during WW1 they were scared the brewery might get destroyed, so they shared the recipe with St Bernardus. It's not exactly the same anymore, but the St-Bernardus Abt is very similar. 10% so pretty strong. Rochefort 10 is 12% if you want it really strong.\n\n5. All the Belgian trappist breweries are great, La trappe in Holland is great too. The other are VERY new breweries with pretty mediocre beers. So don't bother.\n\n6. Geuze/Kriek. I fucking love these. Geuzes is brewed by natural fermentation. The beer in poured in large copper baths and it will start to ferment by itself. Geuze is a sour beer. Kriek is based on the same method, but a (sour) kind of cherry is added and left to age for a year of more. Although there are also Kriek beers that are basicly just beer + cherry syrup. These are extremely sweet and not a 'real' kriek. The best Geuze has been aged for about 4+ years, but that'll be a bit harder to find.\n\n7. Saison beers. Usually not to much alcohol (6-8%). Usually a pretty refreshing beer, nice to drink in the summer.\n\n8. There's also the IPA's (a recent thing), Stouts, fruity beers, white beers, etc.\n\nSome of the more popular beers you might want to try: Duvel (a standard strong blond beer), Karmeliet (a more herbal taste), Lachouffe (a bit sweeter), Boon geuze (sour), boon kriek (sour with a bit of sweet), Westmalle trippel, St Bernardus abt 12, Orval, Chimay bleu, etc.\n\n\nIf you go to a proper beercaf\u00e9, you can just ask the servers for advice. They'll be happy to help, but it will help if you know what to ask for (Strong or light, bitter, sweet, sour, etc).\n", "id": "damb4mq"}, {"comment": "Who's a good Belgian ?

It's not exactly the same anymore, but the St-Bernardus Abt is very similar. 10% so pretty strong. Rochefort 10 is 12% if you want it really strong.\n\nI think they actually outsourced all production of Westy to Watou (now St. Bernardus) after WWII because it was thought that brewing began to distract the monks from their religious duties. They only started to brew again within actual the Abbey in the early 90's because of the Trappist Brand mark that was created (and obviously Bernardus wasn't one so they had to bring back production of Westy 12, 8, and Blonde back to Westvleteren.) If you look at old bottles of Westy when it was made in Watou, like from the 50's, the labels look much like the Bernardus labels look like now and everything. People still have bottles cellar'd from that era because of how well the Quad ages, so bottles that old are usually crazy expensive. \n\nIt really isn't difficult to get, but merely expensive. I order it once a year but limit myself to that because of cost (places like Belgium in a Box online make is easy, and they even get some rare Lambics in sometimes like Cantillon, etc.). Bernardus Abt. 12 is extremely comparable to Westy 12 and can be bought anywhere easily internationally in actual stores, both are fantastic Quads.   \n\nThere was also that time back in Dec. 12 that they released six packs all around the world for like 80 bucks a six pack, which was pretty cool (to fund their new abbey if I remember right).

The clashes were not about ethnicity(both christians and muslims were Greeks speaking Greek and having Greek surnames) but about the support of the muslims for the regime of the Sultan. Think of Nazi collaborators. The muslim Cretans organized battalians and attacked the Christians who were rebelling against the Ottomans. There were tons of Christians that died in those rebellions until Crete's autonomy was achieved. Btw, during the Ottoman invasion Crete's population was reduced by 70%.\n\nGreeks and Turks live just fine in Greek Thrace.\n\n> I don't think a war like that will happen in my lifetime but how about a 50 years later?

There is little to gain and much to lose in invading Baltics for Russia, so I don't get why so many in Baltics believe Putin will inevitably start a war with them. Even at the height of Russian military propaganda in the summer of 2014 the large part of Russian population was not in favor of large-scale 'hot' war with Ukraine. What we got (clandestine intervention in the conflict and continuing support of 'our guys') is about what most Russians could support. But starting a WW3 by invading random countries? That's not exactly a popular proposition. \n\nI imagine only two scenarios where Russia might be forced to invade Baltics: the first is where those countries start a campaign of genocide against ethnic Russians. Like, mass executions on the streets. This could force the Russia's hand (even against the wishes of Putin himself, who is not exactly an ethno-nationalist and has a lot of critics on the right), but hopefully it will never ever happen as it happened in, for example, the 90's Tajikistan. The second scenario is a threat to Kaliningrad, the keypoint of Russian strategic defence in the Baltic region. If Germany, Poland and Lithuania attempted to blockade or invade Kaliningrad, Russia would be forced into at least a small scale conflict if not an actual nuclear war, which will probably involve occupying the countries of Baltics because of the purely geographical reasons. Hopefully, we won't see WW3 in our lifetime or at least it won't start here.\n\nBy themselves, the countries of Baltics aren't of much interest to Russia. They were a logistical hub for our sea trade for a long time, but as far as I know we mostly ship goods through the ports on the Russian mainland now. The majority of Russian population does not like Baltics because of the mid-2000s scandals and Russophobia, but the countries of Baltics are seldom in the center of news or political discussions. Based on what I read of translated Baltics press, your level of anti-Russian propaganda is way higher than our level of anti-Baltics propaganda.

There's a few areas where the Assad regime is uniquely bad however:\n\n1. It killed 1500 civilians in a Sarin chemical weapon attack including 500 children. Russia of course blocked the UN from directly implicating Assad in the attack but the source of the attack was verified to come from the Syrian Arab Army. They've gone on to carry out multiple other chemical attacks using chlorine (not as bad as Sarin but has still caused countless casualties). This violates international law and an international norm - this is rare even among the most tyrannical regimes in history (Saddam in Halabja did a similar attack). The only other group responsible for chemical weapons attacks in the Syrian war is ISIS and even then they've been reduced to chlorine attacks mainly against rebels.\n\n2. They are [responsible for ~95% of civilian casualties in the war](http://whoiskillingciviliansinsyria.org/) and according to every poll carried out of Syrian refugees in several countries Assad has been the number one reason they've fled Syria. Merkel has said the same recently.\n\n3. Assad's clerical mouthpiece [Grand Mufti Ahmad Badreddin Hassoun](http://www.voanews.com/a/top-syrian-cleric-warns-of-suicide-bombs-if-west-attacks-131485523/146459.html) has threatened to send suicide bombers to attack Europe and the United States.\n\n4. Even outside of the civil war, the regime is responsible for crimes against humanity against detainees so extreme they amount to \"extermination of the civilian population\" [according to the UN's findings.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/syria-assad-regime-kills-so-many-detainees-it-amounts-to-extermination-of-civilian-population-un-a6860876.html) \n\n5. Due to lack of available manpower Assad is now heavily reliant on Shi'ite militia including Hezbollah and the same groups who were conducting attacks against Western forces based in Iraq. [Hezbollah](https://mobile.mmedia.me/lb/en/newsreports/567525-hezbollah-to-play-lead-role-in-new-syria-regime-force) and [Iran](http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/how-iran-is-building-its-syrian-hezbollah) will also take leading roles as they are primarily the reason the regime is still around today. This basically means Syria becomes a colony of Iran and there is now a very strong anti-West axis going from Iran all the way through to the Mediterranean via Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. If Iran were to restart its nuclear programme or up its support of listed terrorist groups they would be able to retaliate along this entire axis which is entirely dependent on Iran.

The Romanians' decision (54% of Transylvanians) was supported two weeks later by the German minority's similar decision, another 10% of the population. The 31% minority Hungarians were not enough to disqualify that.\n\nNational days often have a win/lose side to them. But July 4th is not perceived as offensive by the British, just a celebration of American independence.

It's more about the suffering of the Hungarian people who could not decide their fate and were forced to become inhabitants of a foreign country without ever moving from their hometowns.

Almost nobody alive today in Hungary experienced that, so the reason they are bitching about it today is because that's how they were raised. Well, the government could intervene and try to stop new generations of hungarians being raised crying for spilt milk. Education should fix this. Instead, they encourage and promote the same tired message.\n\nLet's not forget that when crying over Trianon hungarians conveniently \"forget\" they were part of an empire themselves, and they ruled over other nations and abused and oppressed them.

Their ancestors were wrong 100% of the time when choosing sides in a world war.\n\nTo end this, I think it's shameful to pull this shit as a member of NATO and the EU. I think other EU members should call them out on this. In order to join NATO they had to officially give up any territorial demands. Romania had to do the same thing, too.

In both cases there's always someone interpreting the \"will\" - a high priest for a *vox Dei*, a political leader for the *vox populi*. God says this, the people want that.

You are describing a Ponzi scheme. The alternative is obvious: incentivize native birth rates. For instance in Germany an additional 20k euro / 1 million children / year (the replacement rate) would cost as much as their current 100B / 5 years investment for the migrant emergency. Nothing forbids investing more (or much more) if necessary to avoid sacrificing the historical ethnic homogeneity. Even if you don't find any value in the latter, the result is saving on the at least 10 years to get proficient in the local language and to relearn any local profession other than the low skilled or manual ones (if not, you create even more segregation, and anyway many of these jobs are getting automated). Then you have to subtract those who'll never find work and live on welfare, as expected from how the statistics compare to the natives' ones.\n\n2. What is the threshold between integration and invasion? People sometimes use statistics relative to the total population with the intent of diluting the natives' fear of being displaced.

In 2015, 27.5% of live births in England and Wales were from foreign born mothers (ONS [1]) and 38.5% of newborns in continental France (where statistics on ethnicity are illegal) were judged in conditions to warrant a test for Sickle-cell disease, an inherited disorder which hardly affects any native Western European (AFDPHE [2]).

Gorbachev himself proclaimed the film \"wonderful\" after a private viewing.\n\n\"For the life of me, I can't understand how Gorbachev could like it,\" he said, sounding distressed.\n\n\n\nBeginning with the 1918 murder of Czar Nicholas II and other members of the royal Romanov family, it presents viewers with one Bolshevik crime against the people after another.\n\nIt documents the mass slaughter of the bourgeoisie under Lenin; the artificially created famines; the tens of millions of deaths and imprisonments under Stalin; the destruction of churches and liquidation of the priesthood; the distortion of people's consciousness with ideological propaganda; and the impoverishment of the vast, rich country through idiotic mismanagement.\n\nThe scenes shift next to the \"disgusting humiliation\" of everyday Soviet life, with its lines, shortages, poverty and moral bankruptcy, and the crooked bodies created by such conditions and \"70 years of the wrong genetic policy.\"\n\n\"The crimes of Hitler's regime cannot begin to measure up to all this in scale and cruelty, especially if you consider that it was done against one's own people,\" Govorukhin says in the film's narration.\n\nAgainst footage of the post-World War II Nurnburg trials of Nazi leaders, he raises the prospect of a similar national trial of Communists. He says the organizers of a crime should bear the brunt of punishment.\n\nThe Moscow News weekly predicted last week that Govorukhin would be accused of \"malice, mockery and painting everything black\" by \"the very people whom he proposes for a national trial.\"\n\nJudging by two preliminary screenings and commentaries beginning to appear in the Soviet press, however, it is mainly Govorukhin's unrelieved gloom, not his political views, that upsets audiences.\n\nOne viewer at the Foreign Ministry showing remarked that \"we all already know we can't live this way. What we need to know is how we should live.\"\n\nGovorukhin, a tall, balding man with a deep voice, offered no apologies for his downbeat views at question-and-answer sessions after the screenings.\n\n\"Personally, I'm a pessimist,\" he said. \"I have no basis to think everything will get better quickly. There's no one in this whole country except absolute idiots who doesn't think tomorrow will be worse.

People who think this is some new thing are exactly the people who are respresented by the systems which the unrepresented people are protesting. \n\nI could go on, but I think we both know what the user was getting at. A lot of young people [16-30] are only now beginning to participate in the political landscape, had they been paying attention for all those years instead jumping in now and opening their mouths as if they speak gospel there would be a lot less turbulence in the political sphere and a lot more sensible discussion. I think a cursory glance at the user's post history would confirm this and establish a clear partisan leaning. Which direction they lean I will leave unstated.\n\nUnfortunately prosperity breeds a certain bit of political lazyness and it is only when the wine stops flowing do people realise they should participate in the governance of their society. Unfortunately by this point they lack a historical perspective but make up for that shortcoming with anger and ignorance. \n\nIts all perfectly predictable and normal human behavior. \n\nEdit: Oh, and another part of it is class struggle. Every time there is a class struggle [haves vs have nots] there is a rise of what we call the \"left\" which is typically followed by a rise of what were call the \"right\". In reality it can be more adequately describe as oppressor vs oppressed, status quo vs change, which then one side is typically hijacked and used as a platform to simply eradicate the previous \"haves\" with a new set of Social-Political-Economic Overlords who pass just enough reforms to end the class struggle for now, or merely replace the oppressor class and proclaim the class struggle over with the regular joe on the street no better and often worse off. That at least is my analysis, I could be wrong. A class struggle can be over wealth, freedom, race whatever. All that it takes is for an inequality[or even merely the perception of an inequality] to exist and for the struggle to become public and polarizing. \n\nEdit2: I cleaned up the language and grammar/syntax and sentence structure.

Despite this huge surge, it turns out that wages didn't really change very much. Why not? Well, as others have pointed out, the Cubans that arrived needed food, mattresses, haircuts - in other words, they are also consumers. As it turns out, the net impact of immigrants as consumers and workers is generally very close to zero (i.e. they push wages down by being recruited as workers, but drive it up by being new consumers). This isn't some armchair economics argument, the overwhelming majority of studies suggest that the impact on low skill wages by immigration is neutral-to-slightly negative (this is also the position of the OECD).

Economics is not only a 'harder' science than most social sciences (such as psychology), but both it and psychology both promote the scientific method and peer review. Just because there are more disagreements in these subjects than in something like physics (due to more uncontrolled or uncontrollable variables) does not mean that it is any less scientific.\n\n>You cannot just outsource thought to economists - that is the ultimate in anti-intellectualism.\n\nActually I can, because the entirety of society is based on trust. It is completely unreasonable to expect everyone to know and understand the complete fountain of human knowledge - because it's completely impossible.\n\nConsider - how do you know that the Earth goes around the Sun? How do you know that the planets go Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune? Hell, how do you know that the Higgs Boson exists?\n\nAssuming you're not an amateur astronomer (or work at CERN), chances are you know this because you were taught it at school. Maybe you've been on the NASA website and seen some photos. How do you know that it isn't just a conspiracy, and that the Sun doesn't just go around the Earth?\n\nThe answer is because a sufficiently trained individual will be able to replicate (generally - replication is a long and complicated issue) the methods of the investigator and achieve the same result. Hence the model proposed by the investigator can be validated or argued by other experts repeating the experiment, or otherwise building off their work.\n\nWhen we're talking about sciences which aren't just hard maths (and this doesn't just mean economics and psychology, this also means chemistry and even physics occasionally), your uncontrolled or uncontrollable variables increases. The point of repetition is to eliminate random variance which are a source of error. Over time and with debate, experts in their fields form a consensus on the issue at hand. We then treat this as fact, since it is the model with the best predictive power at that moment in time.\n\n(It's additionally worth pointing out that this doesn't just happen in economics with their various schools of thought - most people are now aware that two major models in physics (relativity and quantum mechanics) are incompatible. However, both are still used in different applications because they are both still fit for purpose.)\n\nHence, fundamentally, society inherently requires trust and inter-connectivity to function. You might not have ever seen a germ, but you still (hopefully) wash your hands before preparing food. There is no reason for you to decide that germs exist because 'microbiologists said so', yet those economists _can't_ be right about immigration not affecting wages and job opportunities because it's '''''anti-intellectual'''' to just believe them, other than your own cynicism about how it doesn't line up with your own pundit worldview.

It also has the highest standard of living for those in its boarders. \n\nI'm perfectly fine with pro-Israel parties. Because Israel stands for the modern and liberal values that we claim to support. \n\nAs far as Islam is concerned, this criticism is needed. Radical Islam poses a threat to the progress that the western world has made. And though not all Muslims are radical there is a frightful amount of Muslims in the west that support the values and ideas seen by groups like ISIS.

This positioned the city as an important European manufacturing center; urban renewal projects and the modernisation of local infrastructure were initiated by local government. Manuel Agustin Heredia's ironworks, La Constancia, located in San Andr\u00e9s, started a run of productivity in 1834 that made it the country's leading iron foundry.\u201d\n\nThere were more industrial focus in Spain like Vigo, Alcoi, Val\u00e8ncia, C\u00e1diz\u2026 they couldn\u2019t compete with the Catalan industry thanks to the Evil-Spanish-State-Which-hates-Catalans because as the famous Swiss writer Stendhal, who knew Spain well, wrote: \u201cCatalans want just laws \u2013 he notes down \u2013 with the exception of the customs law, which must be done to its measurement. They want that every Spaniard who needs cotton pays four francs the pole, for the fact that Catalonia is in the world.

According to L\u00f3pez, that leaves them with 40% to 60% more in resources per capita*\n\n\nBut ultimately, you are right.

Support for antiestablishment parties is surging in France and Germany, too, both of which have elections next year.\n\nMr. Renzi\u2019s proposed reform takes aim at Italy\u2019s unwieldy legislature, which counts more than 900 members in a system with strong checks and balances established in the wake of fascism. The goal, he says, is to make it easier to pass laws, including those meant to strengthen Italy\u2019s sclerotic economy.\n\nThe overhaul would cut the size of the Italian Senate to 100 from 315 members and strip it of its power to hold votes of confidence on new governments, leaving that responsibility entirely to the lower house. Mr. Renzi says that change would make for more durable governments in a country that has seen more than 60 since World War II. The proposal also aims to eliminate overlapping powers between central and regional authorities that exacerbate the inefficiencies of Italy\u2019s notorious bureaucracy.\n\nMr. Renzi has pledged to resign in the case of a \u201cno\u201d vote, making the ballot effectively a vote of confidence in his government. That has galvanized Mr. Renzi\u2019s opposition. Everyone from union leaders to center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi and former Prime Minister Mario Monti is seizing on the chance to topple Mr. Renzi, a self-styled \u201cDemolition Man\u201d who swept into power in early 2014 with promises to overhaul Italy\u2019s political and economic establishment.\n\nThe vote also comes as voters\u2019 patience wears thin waiting for Mr. Renzi\u2019s economic reforms to kick-start an economy that is only 0.5% larger than in 2000 and where nearly half of young people have no jobs.\n\n\u201cRenzi used to be the Demolition Man, and now he\u2019s the man to be demolished,\u201d says Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, professor of politics at Rome\u2019s LUISS University. \u201cHe has become the establishment\u2026. Many voters want to use this opportunity to punish him for what he has promised and not delivered.\u201d\n\nThe last polls published before a blackout was imposed Nov. 18 had the \u201cno\u201d vote ahead by as much as 8 percentage points. However, at least 20% of respondents were undecided, leaving Mr. Renzi\u2019s supporters hope that a \u201cyes\u201d vote could still prevail.\n\nSome say Mr. Renzi\u2019s resignation could open the door to a new government headed by the 5 Star Movement, an antiestablishment group that now enjoys nearly 30% of popular support. That prospect has spooked markets because of the party\u2019s eclectic economic positions, including a nonbinding referendum on Italy\u2019s euro membership and renegotiation of the country\u2019s \u20ac2 trillion ($2.1 trillion) debt.\n\nBut if Mr. Renzi resigns, most analysts instead expect Italian President Sergio Mattarella to appoint a caretaker government to draft a new electoral law and ferry the country to new elections, currently slated for early 2018. There is broad consensus on the need for a new law, since Italy currently has two different electoral rules for the upper and lower house of Italy\u2019s legislature\u2014a situation likely to produce a hung parliament in the next elections.

In one year service in average rose 1.5 percent, while goods by 0.2 percent.

Slovenia therefore achieves higher growth this year, as announced by domestic and international institutions (Umar, the IMF, the European Commission, the Bank of Slovenia).\n\nPrivate household spending continues to encourage economic activity in the country. In the third quarter increased by 2.6 percent, a weak point remains of gross investments, which have decreased by 0.4 percent. Gross fixed capital formation decreased by 3.6 percent.\n\nAs in previous quarters this year, the gross investments in fixed assets in the quarter negatively affected investment in buildings and structures (are decreased to 12.4 percent). Investment in machinery and equipment rose by 6.6 percent and thus mitigate the fall in gross fixed capital formation.\n\nThe slowdown in the growth of exports and imports\n\nExports in the third quarter of 2016 increased by 5.4 per cent (exports of goods increased by 5.2 percent, exports of services increased by 5.8 percent). Imports increased by 4.5 percent (imports of goods increased by 4.9 percent, while imports of services by 2.5 percent.). The trade surplus has contributed to economic growth by 1.1 percentage points.\n\nEmployment increased by 2.1 percent\n\nTo economic growth in the third quarter of 2016, contributed the most in manufacturing, by 1.3 percentage points. Value added in manufacturing increased by 6.5 per cent. The most significant is the increase in hotels and restaurants, namely 11.0 percent. Total value added of the Slovenian economy increased by 2.5 percent.\n\nIn the third quarter, employment grew by 2.1 percent, which is about as much as in the previous quarter (2.0 percent).\n\nGrowth in consumer prices was in November 2016 at the annual level by 0.6 percent. In one year service in average rose 1.5 percent, while goods by 0.2 percent. Durable goods prices have been increased (0.7 percent), while prices of durable and semi-durable goods decreased (by 1.7 and 0.1 per cent) were calculated national statistics.\n\nChamber of Commerce: growth everywhere except in construction\n\nThe dynamics of annual growth in the third quarter (three per cent) has been adjusted for season and calendar, even higher than in the first two quarters (2.2 percent), but the annual review may be the final value can change quite considerably, as the latest economic data National statistics commented on the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nGrowth in the overall estimates with the exception of construction. This is struggling with a big drop in construction works in civil engineering, as a result of the end of the old financial perspective and the smaller inflow and investments from European funds. A similar trend is also known in most countries of the Visegrad Group. Private investment in facilities and buildings are modest, but the pace of new building permits suggests that growth in 2017 is higher. Companies still invest more in machinery and equipment, which is a good sign for the future growth of industrial production is estimated at Chamber of Commerce, which maintained the estimate of 2,3 percent growth this year and next, the current risks are exposed to the outcome of the forthcoming Italian referendum that would once again shaken confidence in the euro.\n\nGDP is still below pre-crisis levels\n\nIn Slovenia, the quarterly growth again significantly higher than the average in the euro area and in the yoy comparison remain among the countries with the highest growth, in a commentary on available statistical figures highlighted by IMAD. But alongside these positive aspects also point to the much less encouraging fact.\n\nSlovenia is in spite of the relatively rapid reduction of the deficit in recent years, it remains in the group of those countries where GDP lags behind the pre-crisis level: our real GDP is still at least two percentage points lower than it was eight years ago.", "id": "damohu5"}], [{"comment": "So proud when a fellow European country does well <3", "id": "damozyx"}], [{"comment": "Good job bros!

How can I make the call to not know about something if I don't know what it is?  Does this mean that, for example, it is guaranteed that a government permit a four-year-old me to sign away my right to access to knowledge on various subjects for a candy?\n\n> Everyone has the right to an equal participation in the digital sphere.\n\nIs this a positive right, where government must subsidize to smooth out economic differences?  If someone lives in French Guiana, are they required to have the same throughput available for the same price as someone living in Berlin?\n\nHow does this interact with existing hate speech regulation?\n\n> The use of automated procedures must not lead to the exclusion of people from access to goods, services or participation in social life. This applies in particular to health, protection from elementary life risks, right to work, right to housing, right to freedom of movement, and to the judiciary and the police. \n\nI assume that this is aimed at reassurance for people whose jobs are threatened by automation.  It might be desirable to *control* that rate, but I don't think that people should be guaranteed that the state or companies prevent jobs from being automated at all, or it may seriously hamper Europe's ability to economically-compete.\n\n> (1) In the digital age, internal and external security is threatened in a new way.

Exceptions are only permissible on the legal basis for the protection of particularly important legal goods.\n\nI've never liked loopholes like this that might obsolete the guarantee entirely, but from what I've read of constitutions and similar documents in Europe, this kind of \"soft\" guarantee is a lot more common over there, so this may just be a difference in approach.\n\n> (3) Massless monitoring is not carried out.\n\nThe translation is bad here.  I don't know whether this is \"baseless\" monitoring (as in, monitoring without a warrant) or \"electronic\" monitoring.  The former *might* be viable, but seems excessively-broad -- for example, that would seem to ban, say, traffic cameras.  The latter seems too broad.\n\n> (4) Weapon systems may not be fully automated.\n\nI would be more-specific.  For example, does an \"on/off\" switch suffice?  Does someone have to take action at every point in time?  Do the rules change when at war?  What about defensive systems?  I can understand establishing certain \"lines\" that everyone can agree on, like standardizing the degree to which long-range missile systems require human authorization.  I am a lot less-sanguine about placing restrictions on point-defense systems like [Phalanx CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_CIWS), [Tunguska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2K22_Tunguska), [DS30M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30mm_DS30M_Mark_2_Automated_Small_Calibre_Gun), [Meroka CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meroka_CIWS), [Goalkeeper CIWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_CIWS), [GDM-008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinmetall_Oerlikon_Millennium_Gun), and similar.\n\nMy belief here is that the goal is to avoid unbounded automated escalation.  For example, a small glitch causes a robot to act, which causes a larger counter-reaction, which causes a larger counter-reaction, and so forth, and within the hour, a nuclear World War III is underway, with limited human involvement.  I think that this is a technically-complex task that would be better served by an international, UN-level treaty.\n\n* First, the action taken here should be bilateral between potential opponents, not unilateral, since the main incentive to do this is that one's opponent might also do it.\n\n* Second, this is of limited value in avoiding automated escalation unless both sides coordinate specifically how to avoid escalation, draw specific lines.\n\n* Third, it may make more sense to agree on bans on weapons that take effect and *require* very fast reactions in response, like use of laser weapons.  It may make sense to require that automated response may not exceed weapons that give a particular range or a particular destructive power.  It may make sense to require actors to describe in response what they would consider an action requiring automated escalation (e.g. \"any projectiles traveling towards this ship at more than X speed and reaching Y range may permit for an automated response\").\n\nBasically, I don't think that a document on civil rights guarantees, where being unilateral is fine, is a good place for commitments on weapons.\n\n> Everyone has the right to freely express his opinion in the digital world. A censorship does not take place.\n\nI like the idea.  I'm going to be honest -- a document on digital rights is almost certainly *not* the place to change European policy on hate or political speech.  There is no reason to tie this to electronic communication.  If Europe wants to say \"you are guaranteed the right to advocate for communism\", it makes no sense for that to be online only.  Further, I don't think that that right should be bundled up with a lot of these other things -- it's too important.  If the EU wants a Declaration of Freedom of Speech, let that stand on its own.  It's not just keeping up with technological change.\n\n> (2) Digital incitement, bullying and activities which are likely to seriously jeopardize a person's reputation or integrity shall be prevented.\n\nThis -- in particular the \"jeopardize a person's reputation\" -- is almost *certainly* more-restrictive than the current state of affairs.  I'm not enthusiastic about that, and I'd suggest that people carefully consider the consequences.  Does accusing a corrupt politician of corruption jeopardize his reputation?\n\n> (3) A plural public discourse space is to be ensured.\n\nSounds grand, but not concrete.  What does this actually wind up meaning?  Can private forums be moderated, for example?\n\n> (4) Public bodies and operators of information and communication services are obliged to ensure compliance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.\n\nI don't know if the EU has US-style [common carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier) status, but normally in the US, telcos can simply disclaim responsibility for the specifics of communications unless they are made aware of an issue.  That is, they have no obligation to actively-monitor for these.  I think that if this is not the case, it may place a heavy burden on telecommunication operators -- it is not clear to me whether this is compatible with such a status.\n\n> Profiling by government agencies or private is only permitted on a legal basis.\n\nI don't understand the point of this.

Insofar as automated procedures lead to impairments, a person is entitled to disclosure, review and decision.  The criteria for automated decisions are open.                                  \n\nI understand the general fear -- that somewhere a computer will decide that, say, someone's credit is not trustworthy, they will appeal, the bank will say \"well, that's what the computer says...we don't even know how that happens these days or what specifically set it off\", and someone winds up caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare.                                                           \n                                                                                \nI think that it is better to wait for actual issues to come up and let policy be created to address those than to try to legislate in advance here.  In particular, this might require European companies to disclose proprietary secrets in how they make decisions that would disadvantage them.  An insurer, for example, probably falls under this category, but the algorithms used to assess risk is their stock-in-trade, and to give them up may make it difficult for them to make money from and thus fund improvements in that decision making. \n                                                                                \nI would be more-sympathetic to the idea of establishing some sort of trusted appeals board that has the power to demand to see data used for and criteria used for the specifics of a decision.  That also means that people with technical knowledge in the particular area can be the ones examining the thing.  Probably necessary to figure out some way to throttle the rate of appeals coming in, but that at least seems a lot more viable than simply mandating that the public have access to all criteria.    \n\n> Anonymity and transparency must be ensured, in particular, in the processing of mass data. \n\nWell...anonymity always leaks to some degree.  There's no real binary line between being anonymous and not.  For example, you can look at Google Trends and see where particular phrases are popular searches -- [Euromaidan](https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=euromaidan) is important to Ukraine, Germany, and the United States, for example.  That's *some* information leaking, but most people consider that acceptable, since the group of people is still very large.  On the other hand, disclosing an individual's search history in entirety may be an issue.\n\nFurthermore, it may be possible to use multiple data sources that *individually* may not leak enough information to cross the line to deanonymize someone.  For example, if I run a forum and release its database, I might have real names and IP addresses and posting times.  Combine that with another service that has IP addresses and posting times (like Wikipedia, which does this), and I can correlate the IP addresses and posting times and now know what John Smith is reading and working on -- even if each individual thing didn't cross my red line for breaking anonymity.\n\nIf member countries implement this differently, it seems like it would result in a horrible mish-mash of useless legislation.\n\n*If* anonymity guarantees are to be provided, it seems to me like (a) it should  involve people specific with the technology involved and have rules specific to the country involved, (b) probably not be a timeless solution, but a \"solution for a decade\", with new legislation required down the road, and (c) probably be best standardized across more member states, else information that may be released in one may be combined with that in another to deanonymize someone.\n\nThe transparency bit  seems either like a polite nothingness or a requirement that would radically change how the digital world works.  For example, is Google required to give up their advertisement-targeting algorithms if they operate in the EU?  That is, after all, their stock-in-trade...\n\n> (1) Ethical-normative decisions can only be made by people.\n\nI don't honestly think that this is a risk that requires legislation.  That is, I don't think that many people say \"I want and need a machine to set social norms for society without any human involvement\".\n\nFurther, people naturally will use computers *in the process* of\ndetermining norms.  If I do data-mining and determine that 30 percent\nof rapists below 40 years of age engage in\n[recidivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recidivism), but that there\nis no recidivism among rapists above that age, perhaps I say \"it is\nacceptable for society to impose longer prison sentences on rapists until they reach the age of 40 for the protection of society\".\n\nI think that most would not want to interfere with this process, and to the extent that this is unclear, it might do that.\n\n> (2) The use and development of artificial intelligence in areas relevant to fundamental rights must be accompanied by society and regulated by the legislature.\n\nEither too vague or too restrictive to have effect.  Suppose \"accompanied by society\" were removed here -- what actual effect would differ?\n\nI could understand this saying \"The European Parliament shall have the power to regulate the use and development of artificial intelligence in areas relevant to fundamental rights\".  That's a meaningful classification of authority -- it takes power from member countries, and gives it to the EP.\n\nI could understand this saying \"The legislature of each EU member shall establish a board of review which shall have the power to review and regulate the use of artificial intelligence in areas relevant to fundamental rights\".\n\nBut as-is...in all EU members, I suspect that the existing legislature already has the power to establish laws as regards AI.  So this seems like it does nothing in its current form.\n\nI'd add that in the US, this wouldn't make sense -- [*federal regulations*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations) are made by the Executive Branch, whereas [the code of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Code) is made by the Legislative Branch, but I realize that this may be a translation issue or relate to the differences from a parliamentary system.\n\n> (3) A natural or legal person must always be responsible for the actions of self-learning machines and the resulting consequences.\n\nNeat that they thought of [legal persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality).  That being said:\n\n(1) What happens if I set up a shell limited-liability-corporation or the European equivalent and make it responsible for half a million death-drones running around Europe?  Maybe it has $100 in assets or so.  How much meaningful responsibility and ability to dissuade bad decisions or handle their consequences exists here?\n\n(2) I think that this is probably already realistically the case -- that is, I don't think that any court would realistically rule that the operator of such a machine is not liable.\n\n(3) It might be more-interesting to require that the person be made explicit, since otherwise, I see a mess of lawsuits over whether the creator of an AI or the operator is liable for what the AI does, or at least firm up criteria for determining that.  Not even specific to AI -- I'd like to know who is on the hook if, say, all self-driving cars freeze up on leap years, say.\n\n> In the case of infrastructures which are essential to the functioning of the company, state control and crises must be ensured.\n\nHow is that to be ensured?  Like, let's say that I can reduce workers at a power plant by using AI.  Where do I cross the line into inability to act?  I guarantee that if all computer and telco systems went down today, power distribution in the US would be screwed up.  Is AI to meet a higher bar than that?  Should maybe the criteria be that there be some form of \"stress tests\" that happen?  Perhaps that using AI disclose all their known risks and detail how they expect to permit AI control to be overriden in these cases?  Because as-is, it seems to be too vague to realistically do much.  If I'm a company and you feed me a wildly-vague restriction, either I'm going to just stay entirely away from the area as too unknown, or I'm going to ignore the restriction and work it out in court if issues come up.  I'm *not* going to be the one to spend a lot of money to have lawyers speculate what legal constraints probably exist on me.\n\n[continued in child]\n\n\n", "id": "dao9m9w"}, {"comment": "[continued from parent]\n\n> Public sector information must be accessible to the public.\n\nDoesn't seem specific to digital concerns.

Is web-browsing activity from my home something that may not be observed?  By what parties?  That could be a pretty substantial restriction.\n\n[Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo) and [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) sell products with always-on cameras and microphones.

If you can't decide here, maybe create a mechanism to decide on those specifics?  This seems way beyond a fine detail that should be left up to a court.\n\nSpecifically what does \"respect for his privacy\" mean?  Can companies sell personal information that they gather?  How about customer lists?  What happens when they are acquired?  AFAIK, \"privacy\" is not a legally well-defined concept in the EU -- if this were simply elevating a well-defined legal principle to the status of a right, that'd be one thing, but it seems to me that if you're providing a right, you gotta give enough concrete material to let someone have a good guess at what it actually means in terms of restrictions.\n\n> Personal data may be collected and processed only in good faith\n\nWhat would it mean to process data in bad faith?  Like, I say \"I need this data for purpose X\" but then use it for another purpose as well?\n\nYou might just wind up with huge EULAs that everyone forgets about.  How about mandating that companies register the list of things they plan to do with processing with the EU, so that there's a permanent on-record file, and if there's some lawsuit later, people can refer back to it?  Right now, you get a hundred pages of legalese and an \"accept\" button that everyone clicks which probably says what that data is going to be used for.\n\n> Compliance with these rights is monitored by an independent body.\n\nSounds good.\n\n> Providers of services or products may collect and process only those data which are necessary for the purpose of the use.\n\nEhhh...I think that you wind up with companies coming up with trivial justifications, like \"to assess customer actions on our website to improve user experience in the future\" and then just go and log everything.\n\n> The integrity, confidentiality and integrity of information technology systems shall be ensured.\n\n[Integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity) has a technical meaning as regards data storage.  Not sure that's what's meant here.\n\n> Everyone has the right to encrypt their data.\n\nOkay, that's a meaningful right.  Next question: Can they be compelled to decrypt it or hand over keys or have keys stored in escrow or similar, as some EU members do?\n\n> (1) Everyone has a right to the security of information technology systems and the data processed by them. The highest possible protection is to be ensured.\n\nThis sounds like the [best available technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_available_technology) guarantee in the US, which I've never been happy with, since taken literally it creates a legal obligation to essentially spend unlimited amounts of money.  If a vendor comes out with a new form of protection that is better in some way but costs millions of dollars, you theoretically are legally-obligated to purchase it.\n\nI appreciate that protection of data needs to be improved, and that that is a real area in which digital legislation could help.  I do not think that this \nis the way to do it.  In the US, the best example I know of of legislation that provides data protection standards is [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act).  That might be too-restrictive, but I think that realistically, the question of data protection -- at least on certain types of data -- deserves its own legislation and should be more-concrete, and start from something like that.\n\n> Identity theft and identity falsification must be combated.\n\nI think that this is probably already a goal that is legislated against in all EU members.  If something needs to change here -- unification of standards or penalties or more to be done -- then maybe it's best to be specific about that.\n\n> The right to vote and vote must not be restricted to access to digital media. \n\nI assume that this is to avoid vote fraud with electronic voting, to guarantee a non-electronic vote as an available option?  I don't think that this achieves the goal.  Sure, I can guarantee that *my* vote is legit -- but if there's fraud elsewhere, the legitimacy of my vote is irrelevant.\n\n> Everyone has the right to free, equal and anonymous access to communications services without having to renounce basic rights. The Internet is part of the basic supply.\n\nWon't be equal unless you block people from purchasing more bandwidth or guarantee that everyone have the largest-possible amount.\n\n> Everyone has the right to a non-personalized use of digital offers.\n\nI don't know what this means.\n\n> Network neutrality is to be ensured. This also applies to services that provide access to the digital sphere.\n\n\"Network neutrality\" means a large range of things.  Some companies, like Google, treat it as a \"telco providers may not use their [natural monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly) to extract money from electronic services providers\".  Other people want it to ban throttled data access.  Other people want to ban bundling of electronic services with telco services.  Others want it (I *especially* disagree with this crowd) to prevent selling either tiered access or using quality-of-service systems to priorities critical traffic.  If you're going to make a broad guarantee like this, probably want an EU definition of what network neutrality actually is.\n\n> In the digital world, pluralism and cultural diversity must be ensured.\n\nHmm.  I don't really think that this is specific to the digital world, even if that's created more international interaction.\n\n> Market abuse is to be prevented effectively. \n\nSame -- not specific to the digital world.  Anticompetitive institutions already exist.\n\n> Everyone has the right to a digital new beginning. This right finds its limits in the legitimate information interests of the public.\n\nThis is an interesting guarantee.  It's one of the first really *new* guarantees that I see Europe providing.  I am not familiar with the legal history here, though I always wondered how it dealt with backups (of, say, old websites with their databases), and whether the obligation was simply to take down things upon demand.\n\nI think that it may be very difficult to, in practice, enforce this.  If enough *interesting* information is removed, I could see activist groups in locations that do not extend this right (China, US, India, etc) simply running something like archive.org and refusing right-to-be-forgotten takedown requests.  Sure, the EU could block access to these services from the EU, but that isn't really achieving what the EU wants.\n\nFurther, I [recall some serious turmoil in the UK over how political figures were using this to suppress undesirable information about themselves](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/law-firms-exploiting-eu-right-to-be-forgotten-ruling-to-help-individuals-remove-awkward-newspaper-10185164.html).\n\nFurther, it's not clear to me how effective this is in addressing the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect).\n\nI appreciate that going online creates an indelible, world-readable record, and that this is a real, practical change in privacy.  I think that to date, there are still some serious questions about how this is to be implemented.  That is, it seems to me, that some information is really in the public interest to be kept available *even if the individual in question would rather that not be the case*.\n\n> Children, adolescents, disadvantaged and particularly vulnerable persons enjoy special protection in the digital world.\n\nI think that adolescents are fine.  Frankly, I think that the elderly are at greater risk than anyone else, based on historic scams.\n\n> Everyone has a right to education that enables a self-determined life in the digital world.\n\nWould this better be put in a document relating to education, not digital issues?  This seems to be kinda outside the scope.\n\n> Digitization is an elementary educational challenge. It is of central importance in the curricula of public education institutions. \n\nI feel like this is a translation issue.  I'm pretty sure that the authors don't want to teach people to [scan documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitizing).\n\n[continued in child]\n", "id": "daobgch"}, {"comment": "[continued from parent]\n\n> Work remains an important foundation of life support and self-realization.\n\nNot specific to the digital world.\n\n> Effective employment protection must be ensured in the digital age.\n\nAll right, this is a contemporary issue.  It seems to me that this warrants its own document too, and this is *exceedingly* vague on a critical issue -- it's hard to know whether to buy into this.  It could range from requiring employers to put money in escrow to spend $N on retraining if the industry fails to having the government keep defunct industries alive just to make work available, which could be fantastically-expensive.\n\nI do not think that this is a solved problem.  I was reading about how US federally-funded retraining was not very successful a while back.\n\nI think that it would make more sense to, rather than start guaranteeing rights, to instead fund an organization with the target of ensuring that unemployment/underemployment above a certain age falls below a certain level and to deal with automation or shift in demand.  I do not think that there are good policy answers yet.\n\nFurther, I would encourage that any policies enacted at the level of the European Single Market.  Because the EU is a single market, if one member enacts one sort of protection (e.g. subsidizing auto factories that make heavy use of manual labor), and another does not, this creates a wildly-uneven playing field.\n\nI would also point out that while this is a concern, at the moment, my understanding is that youth unemployment is much higher in many members, and may take precedence.\n\n> Rights holders are entitled to a fair share of the proceeds from the digital use of their intangible assets. These rights must be balanced with non-commercial use interests. \n\nToo vague.  What is \"fair\"?  Who, in the absence of this text, would have advocated for an \"unfair share\" to be allocated?  Where is this balance to be struck?  Who strikes it?  I mean, great, nice-sounding principle, but are you granting authority to the EU to make this call on balance, shifting authority from member states?  If not, it's not clear to me what the function of this item is -- it doesn't seem to have any actual function.\n\n> (1) The interpretation of the rights contained in this Charter is ultimately the responsibility of the European Court of Justice.\n\nAh, see, I should have read this first -- should have been up front, since it's critical to understanding the purpose of the document.\n\nOkay, so the point of this document is basically, \"we want to move member state authority on many things to the EU level\".\n\nI agree with some of the moves to the EU authority level.  I think that it is extremely dubious that the ECJ is the appropriate body for this, though it *might* be the right body to make calls about legislation written to implement some of these goals.  Why the ECJ and not the EP, say?  I mean, these are so vague that there must be masses and masses of concrete rules made, and the ECJ's goal is to clarify legislation, not to write it, yes?\n", "id": "daoc1kr"}, {"comment": "In summary:\n\nI think that this is basically too-vague in its form to be actionable for companies and individuals.  I simply cannot know whether something I am doing will violate it or not.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the goal here is to shift authority from member country level to EU level.  I agree with this in at least some cases.\n\nI think that a legislature probably has to hash out the details before something like this enters into force.  These are so broad and overarching that it's nearly-impossible for a company to know whether its actions might run afoul of it.\n\nI do not think that tying together the grant of authority and the specific guarantees is the best way to do this -- it hands an immense wad of power to the ECJ and creates huge uncertainty, if I understand this correctly.  In the US, if you wanted to move something from state to federal level, someone would propose a Constitutional amendment.  Three-quarters of the state legislatures would need to agree.  At that point, the amendment comes into force, and the states cede control over the item to the federal government.  It would *probably* say something like \"The federal legislature shall have the authority to pass laws on this issue\", rather than detailing all the fine points itself -- that is, the grant of power would be independent from the legislation in question.  *Then* the legislature would create the laws (which would be specific-enough to be something that one could take action on).  You could look at, say, the [Eighteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), which federalized authority, and the separate [Volstead Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volstead_Act), which used that authority to establish the precise rules.\n\nIt may be that I am unfamiliar with the EU's processes here, and that there is some other mechanism involved or some reason why this is not necessary.\n\nWhat it *seems* to me is the case, though, is that the idea is to let members retain legislative authority in the area, but then to let the ECJ push them back into line if it thinks that they have crossed the boundaries.\n\nHowever, it seems to me that this three-stage process makes more sense:\n\n1. Member states agree to move authority over an item to the EU level.  They still will retain input on the item, but only as a member -- they won't have absolute control over it within their borders.\n\n2. The EP uses that authority to establish new laws.\n\n3. These laws may be evaluated by the ECJ.\n\nAgain, this may just be due to a misunderstanding of EU process on my part...but if my understanding is correct, it really does seem like having a tight, understandable set of expectations for companies and non-commercial organizations and individuals in advance is much preferable to them having to guess whether-or-not an action is legitimate, take it, and maybe be whacked by the ECJ.", "id": "daocvst"}, {"comment": "> I'd suggest that documents like this should seek to be timeless insofar as is possible. I'd eliminate specific technologies where possible.\n\nAgreed. \n\n> I'm personally not enthusiastic about the criticism of companies -- as far as I know, this is not the norm for existing EU documents.\n\nI wouldn't say that it is critical. It is a valid point of concern that some companies possess too much control over our information. \n\n> I don't understand what this means. Does this means that the rights do not apply to NGOs like Greenpeace or to companies? Do they apply to foreign government bodies? \n\nI think they wanted a definition that applies to anybody, not just limited to the governemnt. Everything that isn't the government is private. \n\n> What is the jurisdiction here -- do these claim to apply to, say, German companies dealing with private Chinese citizens? Chinese companies dealing with German citizens?\n\nGood question, this touches on the essential problems of the internet. Unlike everything we know so far, the internet isn't limited to national borders. It remains open whether this applies to data stored in europe or data accessed in europe. I would say the latter. \n\n> I don't understand what this means. May be the English translation, but is this libre or gratis? Is this a positive right guaranteeing government-funded Internet service (and access to any future information services, without fee, like academic publications?) How does this interact with existing restrictions on, say, hate speech or copyright?\n\nIt isn't the translation. The term has mutliple meanings in German as well. Could be interpreted either way.\n\n> I don't know what this means. How can I make the call to not know about something if I don't know what it is? Does this mean that, for example, it is guaranteed that a government permit a four-year-old me to sign away my right to access to knowledge on various subjects for a candy?\n\nI think it means that you are not object to all kinds of information if you don't want it. If you do not want to be adressed by special offers, you should have the right to enforce that. That's what I understand at least. \n\n\n\n\n> How does this interact with existing hate speech regulation?\n\nNot at all? \n\n> I assume that this is aimed at reassurance for people whose jobs are threatened by automation. It might be desirable to control that rate, but I don't think that people should be guaranteed that the state or companies prevent jobs from being automated at all, or it may seriously hamper Europe's ability to economically-compete.\n\nAgreed. This sounds like guaranteeing jobs that have become obsolete. \n\n> Seems redundant -- this is just saying \"laws must be followed\", yes? Surely that would already have been the case.\n\nNah, it means that the actions of the state in this area should be strictly limited. \n\n> I've never liked loopholes like this that might obsolete the guarantee entirely, but from what I've read of constitutions and similar documents in Europe, this kind of \"soft\" guarantee is a lot more common over there, so this may just be a difference in approach.\n\nYeah thats how it works here. \n\n> The translation is bad here. I don't know whether this is \"baseless\" monitoring (as in, monitoring without a warrant) or \"electronic\" monitoring. The former might be viable, but seems excessively-broad -- for example, that would seem to ban, say, traffic cameras. The latter seems too broad.\n\nIt is. It means monitoring without any reason. Without a warrant. It appears to be targeted at all the Snowden-related stuff. \n\n\n> I would be more-specific. For example, does an \"on/off\" switch suffice? Does someone have to take action at every point in time? Do the rules change when at war? What about defensive systems? I can understand establishing certain \"lines\" that everyone can agree on, like standardizing the degree to which long-range missile systems require human authorization. I am a lot less-sanguine about placing restrictions on point-defense systems like Phalanx CIWS, Tunguska, DS30M, Meroka CIWS, Goalkeeper CIWS, GDM-008, and similar.\n\nAgreed.\n\n> My belief here is that the goal is to avoid unbounded automated escalation. For example, a small glitch causes a robot to act, which causes a larger counter-reaction, which causes a larger counter-reaction, and so forth, and within the hour, a nuclear World War III is underway, with limited human involvement. I think that this is a technically-complex task that would be better served by an international, UN-level treaty.\n\nEven if there is no escalation happening - imagining fighter robots that kill without any human control are frightening. \n\n> Basically, I don't think that a document on civil rights guarantees, where being unilateral is fine, is a good place for commitments on weapons.\n\nI totally agree. But I doubt that we will find a legally binding treaty here. Too much at stake. \n\n> I like the idea. I'm going to be honest -- a document on digital rights is almost certainly not the place to change European policy on hate or political speech. There is no reason to tie this to electronic communication. If Europe wants to say \"you are guaranteed the right to advocate for communism\", it makes no sense for that to be online only. Further, I don't think that that right should be bundled up with a lot of these other things -- it's too important. If the EU wants a Declaration of Freedom of Speech, let that stand on its own. It's not just keeping up with technological change.\n\nI fundamentally dislike the idea. Since the charta is binding for both state and private actors, it would also mean that we (the mod team) would no longer be allowed to moderate this subreddit. And I can tell you that this would not be pretty. Even those believing in full free speech will have to accept that moderation is necessary. This proposal goes a lot further than *anything* we have seen. The first amendment might be the most liberal law in the world when it comes to free speech - but it mainly affects the government, not the people. I also agree that this is the wrong place for something of this kind. \n\n> This -- in particular the \"jeopardize a person's reputation\" -- is almost certainly more-restrictive than the current state of affairs. I'm not enthusiastic about that, and I'd suggest that people carefully consider the consequences. \n\nIt is somewhat in line with current german law. \n\n> Does accusing a corrupt politician of corruption jeopardize his reputation?\n\nNo. If we are going by the german law, which this charta is obviously based on - the higher your public exposure, the higher the barrier. Public exposure = you need to endure more. \n\n> Sounds grand, but not concrete. What does this actually wind up meaning? Can private forums be moderated, for example?\n\nSounds like nothing that has a place in a charta. \n\n> I don't know if the EU has US-style common carrier status, but normally in the US, telcos can simply disclaim responsibility for the specifics of communications unless they are made aware of an issue. That is, they have no obligation to actively-monitor for these. I think that if this is not the case, it may place a heavy burden on telecommunication operators -- it is not clear to me whether this is compatible with such a status.\n\nHonestly don't know how this is here. \n\n--\n---\n--\n\nIm done for today.

Whenever something can be construed as a rejection of the establishment, or a win for authoritarianism, or a triumph for swaggering, braces-twanging, fast-talking bombast\u2014or some other shift the writer does not like\u2014the subject is ascribed to a global Trump-ite revolution. Often this comes without nuance.\n\n\nTake this week. On Monday the response to the election of a statist, pro-death-penalty MEP as UKIP leader followed the trend. \u201cPaul Nuttall: Poundshop Trump\u201d ran one much-shared tweet; \u201cTrump minus the wig\u201d went another. Today Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, called his party\u2019s victory in the Richmond Park by-election a repudiation of Mr Trump. Then on Sunday Italians may reject their government\u2019s proposed constitutional reforms and a presidential election in Austria may produce Europe\u2019s first far-right head of state since 1945. \u201cItaly has a Trump of its own\u201d ran a Haaretz headline on the leader of the \u201cNo\u201d campaign there; \u201cAustrian nationalists hope for a \u2018Trump bump\u2019\u201d went a Washington Post headline today. Expect much more if these eventualities come to pass. It seems no day goes by without politics somewhere being related to the president elect\u2019s shock victory. \n\n\nEnough.It\u2019s not that the comparisons are wrong. A populist, nationalist wave is sweeping the West. It has to do with the economic crisis, globalisation, automation, immigration, stagnant wages, social media and a less deferential culture; albeit in drastically varying proportions in different countries. Each instance of this shift spurs on the next. So to draw some comparisons is fair. Important ideological and demographic traits unite Mr Trump\u2019s election, Britain\u2019s vote for Brexit, Mr Nuttall\u2019s prospects in northern England, Norbert Hofer\u2019s in Austria and those of \u201cNo\u201d campaign in Italy. There is also the Dutch vote in April against the EU-Ukraine association agreement, the rise of hard-right parties like the Sweden Democrats and Alternative for Germany, authoritarian leaders like those of Hungary and Poland, movements like Pegida and the Tea Party.\n\n\nThe problem is that talking about the similarities between these forces is all the rage, but talking about their differences is not. And that matters. For the similarities tell a flattering story: one of ordinary folk everywhere losing patience with their self-serving rulers, the private-jet-bound Davos crowd, the Clintons and Blairs, the Goldman Sachs bosses and their silky lobbyists. The similarities narrate a 1989 for the 21st century. The overlooked differences, however, are just as striking, and all-together less flattering.\n\n\nThey tell local tales that give the populists less credit. Tales of Hillary Clinton\u2019s failings and those of her campaign, of David Cameron\u2019s endless use of Brussels as a punch bag, of the organisational weaknesses of Britain\u2019s anti-Brexit campaign, of the liberal arguments against Mr Renzi\u2019s constitutional reforms, of UKIP\u2019s dysfunction and Nigel Farage\u2019s inability to win even a favourable parliamentary seat last year. Each of these sagas is distinctive and local. Each, too, suggests that the populists in question are not the dynamic heralds of an unstoppable, inevitable change that the similarities between them might imply.\n\n\nThe differences also repudiate the notion of a sudden wave of change. They reveal that while Ms Le Pen may make the second round in the French election next year, her more overtly right-wing father achieved the same in 2002. They reveal that while Mr Hofer could win the (mostly ceremonial) Austrian presidency on Sunday, his party has been an established force in the country for decades and became the larger part of a coalition government as long ago as 2000. They attribute Italy\u2019s \u201cTrump of its own\u201d to an anarchic Italian tradition that predates not just Mr Trump\u2019s election win but also his birth. They reveal that the post-communist nationalism thriving in central European countries like Hungary and Poland emerged not before the turn of the decade but before the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n\nAnd the differences between populists belie the simple solutions proffered by some moderates. It is widely said that the \u201cliberal elite\u201d cannot possibly understand the changes through which it is living because it does not understand the hard-up strivers driving them. Never mind that this sort of thinking cedes the designation of \u201celites\u201d to those wealthy corporatists who happen to dislike foreigners. It also fails to explain why Mr Trump\u2019s success in neglected, rust-belt America is supposedly echoed in Sweden, a country with a gleaming welfare state and a former steel welder for a prime minister. Nor does it explain why Germany, pace most of the English-language press, still broadly likes Angela Merkel as it approaches 2m mostly Muslim incomers in a matter of years. Nor does it explain why the vast majority of hard-up strivers in America who happen not to be white voted for Hillary Clinton (or even acknowledge that she won the popular vote by over 2.5m votes). As a theory of the times we are in, the simplistic, undifferentiated \u201cglobal Trumpism\u201d narrative sucks.\n\n\nMost telling of all is how the populists cling to the comparisons. In his victory speech on Monday, Mr Nuttall vowed to \u201cput the great back in Great Britain\u201d, a limp echo of Mr Trump\u2019s \u201cmake America great again\u201d. Meanwhile the president elect has called himself \u201cMr Brexit\u201d and given Nigel Farage a high-profile ride in his golden elevator. Ms Le Pen and Mr Hofer celebrated both Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU and the American election outcome. The morning after the Brexit vote Breitbart, the in-house journal of the populist right, ran an editorial claiming: \u201cIt\u2019s not just Britain, you see. The revolution against globalism is, well, global. Britain may be leading the charge, but insurgents and rebels from D.C. to Berlin are also hard at work tormenting their elitist overlords.\u201d Wonder why these populists revel in such similarities?\n\n\nThe answer is simple: unburdened by nuance, the comparisons speak of no messy local circumstances, beg no difficult questions and imply that any given populist force has its finger on the pulse of international events and therefore must be on to something. Journalists who reach for the \u201cX is our country\u2019s Trump\u201d line without specifying the differences are not just lazy: they are abetting the forces of authoritarianism on whom they may believe they are helpfully shedding light.\n\n\nThis is not to say that the similarities do not exist. They do.

"]], [[{"comment": "A PATTERN is emerging in political journalism. Whenever something can be construed as a rejection of the establishment, or a win for authoritarianism, or a triumph for swaggering, braces-twanging, fast-talking bombast\u2014or some other shift the writer does not like\u2014the subject is ascribed to a global Trump-ite revolution. Often this comes without nuance.\n\n\nTake this week. On Monday the response to the election of a statist, pro-death-penalty MEP as UKIP leader followed the trend. \u201cPaul Nuttall: Poundshop Trump\u201d ran one much-shared tweet; \u201cTrump minus the wig\u201d went another. Today Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, called his party\u2019s victory in the Richmond Park by-election a repudiation of Mr Trump. Then on Sunday Italians may reject their government\u2019s proposed constitutional reforms and a presidential election in Austria may produce Europe\u2019s first far-right head of state since 1945. \u201cItaly has a Trump of its own\u201d ran a Haaretz headline on the leader of the \u201cNo\u201d campaign there; \u201cAustrian nationalists hope for a \u2018Trump bump\u2019\u201d went a Washington Post headline today. Expect much more if these eventualities come to pass. It seems no day goes by without politics somewhere being related to the president elect\u2019s shock victory. \n\n\nEnough.It\u2019s not that the comparisons are wrong. A populist, nationalist wave is sweeping the West. It has to do with the economic crisis, globalisation, automation, immigration, stagnant wages, social media and a less deferential culture; albeit in drastically varying proportions in different countries. Each instance of this shift spurs on the next. So to draw some comparisons is fair. Important ideological and demographic traits unite Mr Trump\u2019s election, Britain\u2019s vote for Brexit, Mr Nuttall\u2019s prospects in northern England, Norbert Hofer\u2019s in Austria and those of \u201cNo\u201d campaign in Italy. There is also the Dutch vote in April against the EU-Ukraine association agreement, the rise of hard-right parties like the Sweden Democrats and Alternative for Germany, authoritarian leaders like those of Hungary and Poland, movements like Pegida and the Tea Party.\n\n\nThe problem is that talking about the similarities between these forces is all the rage, but talking about their differences is not. And that matters. For the similarities tell a flattering story: one of ordinary folk everywhere losing patience with their self-serving rulers, the private-jet-bound Davos crowd, the Clintons and Blairs, the Goldman Sachs bosses and their silky lobbyists. The similarities narrate a 1989 for the 21st century. The overlooked differences, however, are just as striking, and all-together less flattering.\n\n\nThey tell local tales that give the populists less credit. Tales of Hillary Clinton\u2019s failings and those of her campaign, of David Cameron\u2019s endless use of Brussels as a punch bag, of the organisational weaknesses of Britain\u2019s anti-Brexit campaign, of the liberal arguments against Mr Renzi\u2019s constitutional reforms, of UKIP\u2019s dysfunction and Nigel Farage\u2019s inability to win even a favourable parliamentary seat last year. Each of these sagas is distinctive and local. Each, too, suggests that the populists in question are not the dynamic heralds of an unstoppable, inevitable change that the similarities between them might imply.\n\n\nThe differences also repudiate the notion of a sudden wave of change. They reveal that while Ms Le Pen may make the second round in the French election next year, her more overtly right-wing father achieved the same in 2002. They reveal that while Mr Hofer could win the (mostly ceremonial) Austrian presidency on Sunday, his party has been an established force in the country for decades and became the larger part of a coalition government as long ago as 2000. They attribute Italy\u2019s \u201cTrump of its own\u201d to an anarchic Italian tradition that predates not just Mr Trump\u2019s election win but also his birth. They reveal that the post-communist nationalism thriving in central European countries like Hungary and Poland emerged not before the turn of the decade but before the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n\nAnd the differences between populists belie the simple solutions proffered by some moderates. It is widely said that the \u201cliberal elite\u201d cannot possibly understand the changes through which it is living because it does not understand the hard-up strivers driving them. Never mind that this sort of thinking cedes the designation of \u201celites\u201d to those wealthy corporatists who happen to dislike foreigners. It also fails to explain why Mr Trump\u2019s success in neglected, rust-belt America is supposedly echoed in Sweden, a country with a gleaming welfare state and a former steel welder for a prime minister. Nor does it explain why Germany, pace most of the English-language press, still broadly likes Angela Merkel as it approaches 2m mostly Muslim incomers in a matter of years. Nor does it explain why the vast majority of hard-up strivers in America who happen not to be white voted for Hillary Clinton (or even acknowledge that she won the popular vote by over 2.5m votes). As a theory of the times we are in, the simplistic, undifferentiated \u201cglobal Trumpism\u201d narrative sucks.\n\n\nMost telling of all is how the populists cling to the comparisons. In his victory speech on Monday, Mr Nuttall vowed to \u201cput the great back in Great Britain\u201d, a limp echo of Mr Trump\u2019s \u201cmake America great again\u201d. Meanwhile the president elect has called himself \u201cMr Brexit\u201d and given Nigel Farage a high-profile ride in his golden elevator. Ms Le Pen and Mr Hofer celebrated both Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU and the American election outcome. The morning after the Brexit vote Breitbart, the in-house journal of the populist right, ran an editorial claiming: \u201cIt\u2019s not just Britain, you see. The revolution against globalism is, well, global. Britain may be leading the charge, but insurgents and rebels from D.C. to Berlin are also hard at work tormenting their elitist overlords.\u201d Wonder why these populists revel in such similarities?\n\n\nThe answer is simple: unburdened by nuance, the comparisons speak of no messy local circumstances, beg no difficult questions and imply that any given populist force has its finger on the pulse of international events and therefore must be on to something. Journalists who reach for the \u201cX is our country\u2019s Trump\u201d line without specifying the differences are not just lazy: they are abetting the forces of authoritarianism on whom they may believe they are helpfully shedding light.\n\n\nThis is not to say that the similarities do not exist. They do. The evidence of the past months is that populist success in one country can \u201cembolden, enlighten and maybe even detoxify\u201d populists in another (as I, hands up, wrote yesterday about Mr Hofer\u2019s presidential run). This process and especially its channels of communication and mobilisation (like the identitarian movement, which I profiled here) deserve extensive scrutiny.

You can't not follow the same regulations and be part of an economic area within which market participants can rely on the fact that part or products they buy from elsewhere within that area will comply with their respective national regulations.\n\nHere's a [short video](https://youtu.be/R6F0inyJPDc) that explains how the Single Market works.

If the UK is part of the single market but doesn't have FOM that will make it a less attractive location for business in comparison to setting up in a country that has access to the entire EU labour market, you don't need to regulate against country's handicapping them selfs economically because its self correcting.

That is not how it is portrayed here. On the other hand I try to tell every Romanian nationalist about the way that some Romanians from Transylvania thought against the Romanian Army 100 years ago (a thing missed by plenty).\n\nOverall, Hungary is more nationalistic. The public discourse even more so, although recently some new wave of BS Romanian nationalism started to sprung here. But nowhere near what you can find in Hungary although I am very wary about it.\n\nSzekelyfold is a rural, mountainous conservative area. What their corrupt, idiot leaders want is power and less oversight in their corrupt deals. The Hungarian leadership there is rotten to the core.\n\nUrban Hungarians in Romania care less about Trianon than you might think. As a relative of mine who speaks Romanian with an accent and whose wife is a Hungarian literature teacher here said \"Whenever I hear a Hungarian moan about Trianon, I barely can stop myself from punching them\".\n\nHungarians are sometimes treated differently in subtle ways but overall the situation is good and definitely improving. It is not the 90s anymore. Some Romanians claim there are absolutely no problem - they don't know.\n\nSituation could be better but there are two sides who profit from them not being ok - Romanian nationalists and Hungarian nationalists from Szeklerland.\n\nIt is utterly disgraceful when a Hungarian politician is arrested and everybody from RMDSZ and Neppart starts seeing oppression of Hungarians in that (they don't believe that, they just like to claim xenophobia everywhere, even where there is none). This is such a stupid counterproductive thing, they can't imagine. The leaders of the Hungarian community lost any respect with this. I had friends in Bucharest (100% Romanians) who voted RMDSZ to balance powers back in 2004. Now they are horrified and claim the party is one of the most corrupt.\n\nI do not see autonomy being a solution and I believe it is a false subject. It would not resolve shit and might fuel even more nationalists from Szeklerland, the 64 varmegye types. Fuck them. No, really, fuck them in the ass.\n\nAbout discriminating, just an anecdote I heard from my Hungarian neighbor whose sister moved to Gyor in the 90s. Even now their neighbors call them \"the Romanians\" although, just like my neighbor they never spoke the language besides basic words. And not just this neighbor but some distant relatives who moved to rural Hungary (near Karcag) experienced the same thing being called \"Budos Olah-k\". Yay for inclusive Hungarians!\n\nI could go on and counter any Romanian nationalist discourse, and I do often that.

At first, they started spreading rumors about VdB suffering from Chancer and Dementia. In the later phase of the campaign, they started calling VdB a nazi, a communist, a spy of the eastern block (while always claiming that Hofer had better relations to Russia) and a neoliberal.\n\nThis right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out. In an earlier debate, he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in Jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of Israel. The TV station found out, that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack Hofer claimed to have witnessed. He and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate. It later became known that while Hofer was at the temple mountain, someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police, but this was not identical to Hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns. He was not near that, but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack. A few weeks ago, he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses. When beeing called out for that, he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim. Telling lies with a straight face is what Hofers campaign is based on.\n\nHofer tried to make himself look sympathetic, but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling \"lies\" when VdB started citing him. There is a real danger that should he get into office, he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view. If he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate, he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness, taking Austria as a hostage with him.\n\nThe really dangerous thing about Hofer is, that he is working against the EU membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to Russia and Serbia. Both of these countries are economically unimportant to Austria. Hofer would cause economical damage by trying to severe relations to countries that are the most important to us while bowing down before a country that offers no perspective for us except how things looked 50 years ago.

In the later phase of the campaign, they started calling VdB a nazi, a communist, a spy of the eastern block (while always claiming that Hofer had better relations to Russia) and a neoliberal.\n\nThis right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out. In an earlier debate, he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in Jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of Israel. The TV station found out, that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack Hofer claimed to have witnessed. He and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate. It later became known that while Hofer was at the temple mountain, someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police, but this was not identical to Hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns. He was not near that, but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack. A few weeks ago, he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses. When beeing called out for that, he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim. Telling lies with a straight face is what Hofers campaign is based on.\n\nHofer tried to make himself look sympathetic, but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling \"lies\" when VdB started citing him. There is a real danger that should he get into office, he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view. If he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate, he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness, taking Austria as a hostage with him.\n\nThe really dangerous thing about Hofer is, that he is working against the EU membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to Russia and Serbia. Both of these countries are economically unimportant to Austria. Hofer would cause economical damage by trying to severe relations to countries that are the most important to us while bowing down before a country that offers no perspective for us except how things looked 50 years ago.

It was recognized by all nations of the Entente, officially invited to the Paris Peace Conference, and became one of the founding members of the League of Nations. Poland also enjoyed a close alliance with France. Lithuania did not receive international recognition (it was first recognized de jure in July 1920 by Soviet Russia) as the Entente hoped to revive the Russian Empire within its former territory, which included Lithuania. Not invited to any post-war diplomatic conferences, it also had to battle negative propaganda that the Council of Lithuania was a German puppet, that Lithuanians harbored pro-Bolshevik attitudes, or that Lithuania was too small and weak to survive without a union with Poland.\n\nThe only reason Poland didn't fully occupy Lithuania was because of it's prestige in world stage, they didn't want to be seen as imperialistic nation.", "id": "dapm72i"}, {"comment": "Great way to sum it up.

Conclusions**\n\n>The EU is currently witnessing an upward trend in the scale, frequency and impact of terrorist\nattacks in the jurisdictions of Member States. France in particular has recently been hit hard by\na series of terrorist attacks, perpetrated both by groups of terrorists and lone actors. IS is\nactively propagating terrorist acts on EU soil by any means available, increasingly inspiring\nradicalised individuals to act. IS has proven to be very effective in both moving people to\ncommit terrorist acts and to set these actions in motion themselves.\nThe success generated by these terrorist attacks, as seen from an IS perspective, will\nencourage the group to hit more targets in the EU. Although France appears to be the primary\nfocus of IS, the organisation has threatened all countries that are part of the US led coalition\nagainst IS in Syria and Iraq, including Germany, the UK and other Member States, which have\nspecifically been mentioned as enemies of IS in several video messages.\nWhat should not be overlooked is that IS is not the only terrorist organisation with the intent\nand capability to carry out attacks against the West, or to inspire individuals and groups\nresiding in EU Member States to do so. Al-Qaeda and/or Al-Nusra affiliated or inspired groups\nand individuals continue to pose a serious threat to Member States of the EU and to Western\ninterests in general.\nNew attacks by both terrorist groups and lone actors are thus to be expected, most probably\nfollowing the patterns that have been used in earlier attacks. New variations in attack, for\nexample in the use of car bombs, may also develop.\nThe continuous increase in arrests and court proceedings across the EU for terrorism related\noffences of a jihadist nature is proof of the high priority assigned to counter terrorism in law\nenforcement and the judiciary. The need for enhanced information exchange is increasingly\nacknowledged and addressed. But as long as IS remains a factor in Syria and Iraq, and even if\nthey are defeated there, they will continue with their attempts to encourage and organise\nterrorist attacks in the EU.", "id": "darh7p0"}, {"comment": "The two threads aren't mutually exclusive. As a state, the Islamic State is losing. Their Caliphate is shrinking. In Iraq, they've essentially been reduced to just Mosul (their other territories will fall quickly once Mosul is retaken). In Syria, they look set to lose Al-Bab to either the Syrian Arab Army & the Kurdish SDF (who are working together) or the Turkish-backed FSA. The main question being asked by people who follow the conflict is which one of those two factions will reach Al-Bab first. Raqqa and all the other Euphrates holdings will last for a while longer but are not sustainable in the long run, given the threat posed by the SAA after they finish off the rebels & any Iraqi PMU forces that decide to cross the border to fight ISIS.\n\nThe Islamic State is unlike past jihadist groups in that its ideology focused around creating a physical state - the caliphate - with leaders, borders, taxes, et cetera. It is going to lose that.\n\nHowever, sunni jihadism won't die with the caliphate. People will continue to conduct terrorist attacks in the Middle East & the West, either in the name of IS or in the name of some other group. My guess is that it there will be a surge in terrorist attacks as ISIS enters its death throes (cornered animals and whatnot) but the attacks (in the west, at least) will decline afterwards. A big part of why ISIS was so succesful at carrying out attacks was essentially due to marketing - ISIS became the go-to brand or any would-be sunni terrorist, effectively supplanting Al Qaeda. Their defeat will destroy their luster, and whilst diehards will remain, the amount of new recruits will lessen.

I wish Europe was at least 10% as concerned and smart about these issues as the Japanese were. When they found out from an early 2000s survey that obesity rates were increasing, the govt freaked out, put their planners to work, and just two years later, had schools implement mandatory food education. They also have schoolchildren provided with nutritionally balanced lunches, as part of the national food policy.\n\nSince then, they've seen obesity rates steadily decline, they have preserved and expanded their country's traditional food culture (also notice how popular Japanese foods have been getting over here in the West lately, I can hardly escape it these days), they have created more jobs (nutritionists, workshops, tours, etc), children have fun in the school gardens and forge a sense of community by eating together and talking about nutrition. Also parents are encouraged to talk to their children about nutrition. Childcare institutes have rules about what lunches children can bring, putting an emphasis on fresh food rather than frozen, preserved or fast food.\n\nEducation is key. Culture most likely also is. And the fact that they have a government that takes their people's health seriously and actually put words into action through early recognition of the problem and an aggressive approach, probably helped too.\n\nMeanwhile in Europe, we're bombarded with headlines every year about how bad sugar is and how Europeans are getting fatter and how we're going to have an obesity epidemic in the next decade. We just kind of shrug it off and don't care because 'freedom' (read: stubbornness and wanting to do the opposite of what someone might say is probably good for you) has become more important than health, apparently. Jamie Oliver tried to get a petition going for food education, and got barely over half of the few million signatures he needed.\n\nQuite frankly, I don't think people realize how serious the situation is. What idiot wouldn't want a healthier population and therefore less burden on society and a larger pool of employable people? I guess the Japanese just take these things more seriously and value education a lot more and see education and good policy as a way to work out issues. No wonder they're outdoing us on so many fronts. You think a sugar tax or whatever is going to do anything? That's just a lazy way of making it look like you pay attention to this problem.\n\nI keep repeating this over and over because I don't think people are taking this issue seriously enough. We're set to have an obesity epidemic in a few years, people.\n", "id": "dapuddu"}, {"comment": "Individualism might be a problem in this case.

Let the missions speak for themselves. Yes NASA features in a lot if fiction but it a lot of that is because it's believable (in some cases) that NASA would take on such a mission. They have earned that reputation with Project Apollo which inspired generations, the iconic STS and dozens of unmanned marvels. If you want ESA to be held in the same regard pump the money into missions, not vain propaganda. Wanting to strengthen European film is admirable but not, in my opinion, for this reason.\n\nPersonally as someone who works in astronomy I believe ESA's media has gone a bit overboard in some cases. Take the landing of Philae for example and compare it to MSL Curiosity. With MSL we watched the mission team who had spent years on this project wait for confirmation and it was breathtaking, only much later did Bolden step in and say a few words of congratulations to the team. With Philae we watched a weird TV show where literally seconds after a quick nod from mission control we launched head-first into speech after speech from politicians and bureaucrats all saying the same things. A few people actually involved in the mission did get a word in edgewise, later. It was all so self-congratulatory and premature, as we later found out things didn't go quite to plan. I'm exaggerating but only slightly. Let the science and the engineering speak for itself. Let the passion of the people who have invested years or even decades of their lives tell the story, it's those engineers who have accomplished something of true merit.

Then it was someone standing in for a vice-chair of the ESA council, both Swiss bureaucrats. Then another bureaucrat from DLR. Then the president of CNES, a bureaucrat. Then 4 more people speak but I don't know who they are as they aren't really introduced but I'm quite sure they're all bureaucrats of some rank or another, one definitely from NASA and one from the UK. None of them express any personal connection to the mission. Then we hear from mission control, after 33 minutes of speeches, and we hear things aren't looking right. Then right back to another ESA bureaucrat from the manned spaceflight division. And then the event is over. No engineers or scientists spoke after the landing as far as I can see. Please feel free to correct me if I missed anyone out.\n\nThis is exactly what happened. ESA's mission control room contained only a few senior managers (6 people is not the whole team, some may not even be Rosetta people), by the time the speeches have ended the control room is dead again.
