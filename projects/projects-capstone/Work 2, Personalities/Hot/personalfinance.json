A small part of your score (10-15%) is the age of your credit. You will want your cards to age with you.

I have a cap 1 card I got about 6 years ago that I haven't used in probably 3 years. It hasn't been inactive and doesn't hurt your score. It in fact helps your score both by increasing your average age of credit and padding your utilization. For instance if you have that card with a 300 limit and don't use it and later get another card with a 500 dollar limit your total credit it 800. So having 100 dollars on one of those cards is compared against both cards limits combined.\n\nIf you find yourself unemployed try to pay the card off, lock it somewhere safe, and check back in when you are employed again.

Merit scholarships? Many of those types of money have different rules attached to them, if it's university grant they may have some more leeway with the rules.

Honestly I doubt the dean of student knows much of anything about financial aid rules so unless this info was passed directly from financial aid, I'm not sure I trust it. Now given all the gray areas you can ask to schedule a meeting with the most cogent-seeming person in financial aid and ask clarifications about whether things are \"all set\" if you get them the document by that date or whether there is still some risk you won't get that money at that point. Tell them you will do abosuletly everything in your power to try to get the document in on time and that you ask them they do everything in their power to help you get your aid.

Some can be used for unpaid balances in past semesters within a certain amount of time. When you meet with someone ask if they have any resources or recommendations and how that process would work logistically with their office after the semester is over and what the processing turnaround is. They might have resources on their website.\n\nAnother option if they say they won't give you the money is to escalate to the president.

Here are what I perceive to be some of your main points to plan- how is the 2015 tax return transcript being obtained? Is parent trying every day to get it electronically at irs.gov? Are they walking into an irs office that takes walk ins? If they request it be mailed via the IRS website then that takes another 5-10 days. Do you have a point person at the university that you are sending this to directly who can confirm receipt? Are you facing or dropping it off? \n\nNow, what types of aid are you expecting from the school? Pull grant, direct loans, Perkins loans, state grant? OR \"university grant money\"? Merit scholarships? Many of those types of money have different rules attached to them, if it's university grant they may have some more leeway with the rules. Federal aid like pell grant and direct loans are very highly regulated and there are indeed a lot of specific rules about timing. For example they can't process direct loans once the semester has ended. I work in financial aid and this is a difficult conundrum because there is such a thing as \"late verification\" sometimes, but only for specific types of aid and in certain circumstances. Honestly I doubt the dean of student knows much of anything about financial aid rules so unless this info was passed directly from financial aid, I'm not sure I trust it. Now given all the gray areas you can ask to schedule a meeting with the most cogent-seeming person in financial aid and ask clarifications about whether things are \"all set\" if you get them the document by that date or whether there is still some risk you won't get that money at that point. Tell them you will do abosuletly everything in your power to try to get the document in on time and that you ask them they do everything in their power to help you get your aid. Calmly explain what a financial blow it would be to not get it and kindly thank them for their time and assistance - hopefully these people will do what they need to do to help you.\n\nNow worst case scenario if you don't get any money one of the last resorts would be a private educational loan from a private lender. Some can be used for unpaid balances in past semesters within a certain amount of time. When you meet with someone ask if they have any resources or recommendations and how that process would work logistically with their office after the semester is over and what the processing turnaround is. They might have resources on their website.\n\nAnother option if they say they won't give you the money is to escalate to the president. This is your abosolutely last resort - write them a professional email or hand deliver a letter to their office. Ask them in writing to confirm receipt and respond at their earliest convenience for whether they can help you. Kill them with patience and kindness.

At my school if you take an incomplete you have the next semester to finish up the course work but you do not actually get enrolled in the course for credits for that next semester.

Bottom line. For most managers, you're just a cog in the wheel. They got by before you and they'll get by after. You need to be in a position where losing you will really be a difficult situation for them. \n\nThis is especially important for jobs which are not highly skilled jobs. They can replace you literally today.\n\nPeople see things in black and white but here, it's not so simple. While leverage works for some people, don't bank on it. I'd say the odds are against you. I see people on here often saying the opposite and I think it's irresponsible.\n\nIf you are using an offer as leverage. You MUST be prepared to walk away. Do not make up some leverage and do not use leverage if you don't actually feel you're happy to walk away and into a better position. Sorry OP, don't mean to rag on you, it's more on the people on this sub who give this advice.\n\nOne last thing has to be mentioned too. Even if you're lucky enough to get a counter offer and it's acceptable to you... it's still sort of a black mark on you for a while for most managers, and it gets worse if word get's around. Managers will somewhat question your commitment and loyalty for a while so if you get the raise, they expect you to earn it going forward. It'll wear off eventually once you've proved you're not the sort to pull this for no reason. They want to see that you are infact committed and dedicated to your current position and you were only thinking of accepting the other offer because it was justso much better financially, it wouldn't make sense to turn down... otherwise you'd never dream of leaving your current position.\n\nSince word easily gets around a workplace, co-workers can be somewhat resentful of it too because if you get a raise, it's at their expense. There's only so much money for bonuses and raises in any company and if it goes to the other guy, you won't be happy. They'll also question, like the manager, how much they can rely on you if it's some sort of project setup where they feel you might just up and leave any time leaving the burden on the workload on them to meet deadlines.\n\nThink about what you're doing and make sure you're doing the right thing."], [218, ">A cautionary tale for all those who read that getting a new offer is a good way of leveraging a raise at your current job - if you do this be prepared that you may have to walk away\n\nYeah.. that is pretty much common sense."], [135, "Well, yeah.

Sorry OP, don't mean to rag on you, it's more on the people on this sub who give this advice.\n\nOne last thing has to be mentioned too. Even if you're lucky enough to get a counter offer and it's acceptable to you... it's still sort of a black mark on you for a while for most managers, and it gets worse if word get's around. Managers will somewhat question your commitment and loyalty for a while so if you get the raise, they expect you to earn it going forward. It'll wear off eventually once you've proved you're not the sort to pull this for no reason. They want to see that you are infact committed and dedicated to your current position and you were only thinking of accepting the other offer because it was justso much better financially, it wouldn't make sense to turn down... otherwise you'd never dream of leaving your current position.\n\nSince word easily gets around a workplace, co-workers can be somewhat resentful of it too because if you get a raise, it's at their expense. There's only so much money for bonuses and raises in any company and if it goes to the other guy, you won't be happy. They'll also question, like the manager, how much they can rely on you if it's some sort of project setup where they feel you might just up and leave any time leaving the burden on the workload on them to meet deadlines.\n\nThink about what you're doing and make sure you're doing the right thing.", "id": "daq2d2e"}, {"comment": "Well even if you're just average, it takes way more time and money to train someone new for your job than keeping you. Usually it's worth it to just give someone a raise. And if they don't like you or consider you a flight risk, they start looking for replacements in advance. Then again, I'm looking at this from a skilled/educated position.

If you're *highly* skilled and are literally walking out the door with knowledge they just can't get a new person up to speed on in time... yeah.\n\nBut those are the minority. In most office jobs, there's another engineer or accountant or whatever who can do what you do. And mostly, there's always another store assistant, or mailman, or whatever that they can place in there.\n\nIf you're not in the top tier, it's a huge risk. You need to be able to know you ARE in that position and be realistic in assessing your value.", "id": "daqb2u0"}, {"comment": "Right, but what I'm saying is almost any skilled position takes a lot more hiring and training time than you think to get up to a current employee's efficiency. If you're an engineer, you don't have to be a great one to have lots of valuable in-company experience. You know how their database system works, you know how they do purchasing, you know who to contact for typical issues, and you don't have to bother other employees for this type of information. And to hire someone new you often have to pay market rate, which is probably more than what the current employee is making if they're disgruntled. I think you are underestimating how quickly people can come up to speed. Most studies show it takes a few months to a year. That time costs money.", "id": "daqo1dq"}, {"comment": "I hear you. I'm just saying, not all managers think like you.\n\nI'll give you an example. The company I work for loves to outsource as much as it can. Similar to OP's case. Personally I prefer talent to be on-site, especially if they are good. At least once a year rumours fly around about cut back in engineering. It makes everyone feel uncomfortable. Not a good way to run things for staff moral, but these managers think it keeps people on their toes. \n\nIt prevents people from really asking or pushing for raises/promotions because they know the company would jump at the chance to move the position abroad and save money.\n\nNow, in my position, I hate it. I've had some seriously talented people leave or be cut and given cheaper/less experienced staff I have to work with abroad. It's terrible. As you said, those who left, left with a lot of knowledge and experience and we're constantly scrambling to get off shore resources up to speed and a lot of them are very unmotivated and I can't tell if they don't want to or just can't produce at the same level.\n\nProblem is... the very managers above me, who ultimately decide on the money, make all the decisions. They work on the motto that engineers are just cogs in a wheel and we are in a buisness and location where the competition is fierce for engineering staff. We can find new ones easily.\n\nHonestly, I think what you personally are doing is great. You value good workers and in a fair world, every manager would. But it's not realistic to say the majority or managers do, especially when they themselves are being pushed to cut expenditure constantly by owners/CEOs/shareholders.\n\nThat's why I say it's not good to tell *everyone* this is a good idea. Know you're own worth to your own manager is probably a better way of putting it. If I was making the calls, I'd retain more of our talented guys, just as you say because I see their value. The management above does not. Therefore if one of my engineers were to approach management, they surely have to have assessed the direction of the company and understand management is unlikely to match their offer... however, if you were their boss, then they can appraise the situation differently. And that's why it's important to evaluate and not just tell everyone in any situation they should feel they are worth so much.", "id": "daqp6z8"}, {"comment": "From what I've seen, I think you're mischaracterizing how \"leverage\" is used here.

For a credit card, that would be your credit limit.  For a bank, it might be a loan.\n\nWhen you get a credit card (cc), your credit history will be updated with a few things:\n\n* credit inquiry - someone checked your credit history to see if you are a risk to their money.  They can be a soft pull (quick check, general info) or hard pull (full history) depending on what you're getting checked for.  Typically, a cc or loan will be a hard pull.  An increase in a credit limit down the line may only be a soft pull.  Too many hard pulls in a short period of time may cause you to be denied for whatever it is you're having it checked for (car loan, addtl credit card, etc.).\n* # of accounts - how many accounts you have, both open and closed.  Too many newly opened accounts in a short period of time may cause you to be denied for future lines of credit (loc).  After a period of time, these tend to drop off or have less impact.\n* average age of credit - the average age of your open accounts, from the time they started through today.  The lower this age, the less likely you are to get \"better\" loans e.g. lower interest rates, higher credit limits, etc.\n* credit utilization - how much money you have in the form of a balance due on your ccs / locs, versus the total credit limit.  if you have 1 account open, owe $2k, and the limit is $2k, you are at 100% utilization.  If you only owe $1k on a $2k credit limit (cl) card, then your util % is 50%.  You want this value to be < 10%.  10-20% is ok.  Any higher, your credit score takes a significant hit, and you become a risk to those loaning you money in the future.  You will end up with higher interest rates on your future loans, or possibly get denied.\n* history of payments - if you were on time or late for any payments on any account, ever.  do not miss a payment.  do not make late payments.  if necessary, at least make the minimum payment required.  do not. miss. payments.\n* derogatory remarks - if you ever went to collections, or similar situations.  you rack up $3k on a cc.  you stop paying.  it goes to collections.  it gets reported to the major credit bureaus.  it ends up here.  dont do this.  same with not paying a doctor's bill, or other owed debts.  they end up here, and hurt for up to 7 years if you don't take care of them.\n\nthe biggest factors in calculating your credit score are credit util %, payment history, and derogatory remarks.  the others factor in as well, but not as much.\n\nin this situation, if you open the amazon card, you now have 1 hard inquiry and 1 account on your credit report within 30-60 days.  with that, amazon will report your credit limit how much you owe on the card.  if this is your first card, youll end up with an avg age of 1 month.  if you pay off the balance, your util % will be 0%.  youll have 1 month good pay history.  for every month you keep the account open with $0 balance when they report to the bureau each month, youll have another month added to the age of the account, another month good pay history, and another month with 0% util.  these are all good factors.  a lot of ppl close cards they arent using.  if theres no fee to keep the card open (some have a yearly $ to maintain the card account and any benefits), then keep it open.  the longer your history with good payments, the less of a risk you look to lenders.  the less of a risk you appear to be, the lower any future interest rates will be, and the larger the amounts you can be loaned.", "id": "dari86b"}], [{"comment": "Amazon gets a bonus from you signing up for their card.

You'll also need to increase your emergency fund because you'll be spending about another $1k per month on mortgage+utilities than you currently do, so let's call it $121k needed in total savings to buy a $500k apt.

It helped a lot and at least got me to the point where I could make sure I had my major bills covered without scrambling. Their \"goals\" mechanism is pretty cool. But it's also pretty limited. And \"occasional big bills\" like my $500 vehicle registration, or $400 annual gun club membership use to jump out of nowhere and I'd have to scramble again. But I still give Simple a big thumbs up and recommend it.\n\nSo I decided to try a budgeting app and I actually tried two the first month: Dave Ramsey's free \"EveryDollar\" and YNAB. Halfway through the first month, I declared YNAB the winner and stopped using EveryDollar. I don't recommend it (but it might work for you so maybe check it out anyway!)\n\nNow that I feel totally in control with YNAB, I'm moving all my banking back to my CU. I'll keep Simple around. But now nearly all my monthly spending goes on my Cashback card. Because of YNAB, I never have to worry about over-spending and not being able to pay the card off. Before YNAB, the card was \"emergency use only\" because I never had a clear enough grasp on what money was going where to be confident I could pay the card off in full. So even though YNAB is $5/mo, I'm making more than $25/mo in cashback now, all because of YNAB. And that doesn't even include the hundreds (thousands some months) more that I'm saving just by being aware of where I'm spending money.\n\nAnyway, sorry for rambling. I just really dig the tool.

Sure the 50k will hold you out for a few months and you can still pay the minimum, but your minimum payments are almost $4,000! And most of that is still towards interest! At least you can get rid of some of the interest and still have an amount to live off of, and won't be required to pay as much in minimum. Sure if you run out of money, you'd need to use a CC to pay things off and go into more debt, but it's better to get rid of 40k debt now which incurs interest for a year and gain 10k debt a year later. Sure not getting into more debt is ideal, but not paying off what you can now puts you in a worse situation.\n\nIf you pay off the 28k personal and the BOWL loan (I assume its around 10k) that's 38k of debt gone.

I know of people personally who lived with a family of 6 off 20k a year. Sure they struggled and sure they lived in a cheaper and more dangerous area, but even if you raise the standard of living they could've gotten by with 50k.

Now say after 3 months of losing your job, you find a new one. Great, but you still have 124k in debt, and maybe 20k left over from your efund. your net = -104k.\n\nNow, say you paid of 40k of that debt lose your job a year later, your minim payments are 2.8, of the 30k previously used, 11.4k was from minimum payments, so you really spent 18.6, and in this case with a lower minimum payment, you'll need to take on new debt of 17k, but now you'll -101k net worth.

I know my other expenses (mortgage, auto loan and insurance, personal loan, and paying the guy who trims my horses' hooves) which are always the same, and then I look at what I have left over and know that's my actual cc limit for that month.

The problem is that the more people use credit cards, the price of goods goes up greater than the payback you get. \n\nThat is, stores must pay the credit card company for the use of the card, and are either barred by contract or law (lobbied by credit card companies) from charging the individual for the use of the card; they have to include it in overhead costs of doing business.\n\nAs an example, suppose the credit card company charges the store owner 3% for each purchase. If you are the only person using a credit card and you spend $100 per month in that store, the store needs to pay $3 per month to the credit card company. If the store sells $100,000 worth of goods each month, they can just raise the price of everything by 0.003%, which is negligible. Essentially, all of the other customers pays for your credit card use (as do you) by a very small amount. And the credit card company give you back 1%, which is $1 in this case, and keeps the other 2% ($2).\n\nNow as more people catch on to this, more use credit cards. If everybody uses credit cards, and the store still pays 3% to the credit card company for each use, now they owe $3000 per month for the $100,000 in sales (all using credit cards), which means they raise their price of goods by 3%. And everybody gets their 1% back, so everybody is now paying 2% more and thinking they are getting a deal of 1% back. \n\nThe reality is that it will be somewhere between these two cases of 0.003% and 3%. Some will use credit cards but not everybody. If 1/3rd of sales use credit cards, prices rise 1% and you break even if you use the cards. If greater than 1/3rd, you are losing money; if less you are making money.\n\nIronically, it's the people who don't use the cards that pay the mark-up but don't get it back as rewards that make the credit card company their money. Sadly, the people who don't qualify for the cards, or the better rewards cards, are the poor. That is, the poor tend to pay slightly higher retail costs, part which goes to the rewards of the richer card users, and part which goes to the credit card company revenues.\n\nHowever, there is never a point where you, as an individual, are better off not using the card. If everybody else is using it and you don't, you are paying the inflated prices but not getting the 1% back so are worse of than if you used the card and got 1 back. If you use it you have have a small punishment of 2% loss. If you don't use it you have a larger punishment of paying 3% loss from markup. \n\nIf nobody else is using it and you don't use it, you break even with $0 net. If you do use it, you have a net reward of 0.997% (1% reward - 0.003% markup in price).\n\nThis is an example of a financial Prisoner's Dilemma. The only way to get rid of it is by legislating it to be an illegal practice, perhaps forcing stores to charge the credit card users directly for the costs of using credit cards.\n\nThere are other values to credit cards though, like fraud coverage and credit score, but that doesn't really change the description above; that just gives individuals potential reasons to use the card even if they had to pay for it's use directly at the checkout. \n", "id": "daqghpm"}, {"comment": "This only covers credit cards and assumes cash is perfect though. \n\nThere's also two additional cases off the top of my head. \n\n1. people are likely to spend more depending on payment method: http://www.cultofmac.com/455124/apple-pay-drives-vending-machine-spending-roof/ .

I believe the gifter can claim from their 5 million estate tax to avoid paying taxes, but I really don't know the rules well.", "id": "dargxh2"}, {"comment": "> I really don't know the rules well.\n\nHere's my copy-pasta of the rules. In other words, there's very little chance that, at least at the federal level, that there will be any taxes:\n\nThe TL;DR is that no one pays federal gift or estate tax unless you're multimillionaires. The giver *reports* some larger gifts, but that doesn't mean it's taxable.\n\n\nThe following is my understanding. It should be at least mostly correct, but don't depend on it alone for any big decisions. :-)\n\n* Every year, any person can gift any other person up to $14K (the \"annual gift exclusion\") without any paperwork.\n* The annual gift exclusion is per-*person*, so e.g. if your parents are giving you something they can each give you $14K; if you're married, each of your parents could give each of you and your spouse $14K (total: $56K)\n* There are also other things that don't count at all, like paying an educational institution or (I think, in some cases) paying directly for health care.\n* If you exceed the exclusion, you have to *report* the gift (form 709) when you do your taxes. However, that does not necessarily mean it's taxed yet.\n* You have a lifetime *total* unified gift/estate limit of, currently, about $5.45 million. When you die, if the total value of everything inherited by people-not-your-spouse exceeds your unified limit, then estate tax is owed on the excess.\n* If you exceed the annual exclusion, the excess reduces your unified gift/estate limit; this means that a smaller estate may be taxed.\n* If your lifetime unified limit is reduced to $0, only then do you start paying gift tax.\n\nSo examples (assume everyone is unmarried):\n\n* Bob never exceeds the annual exclusion. He dies worth $5 million. No gift tax, no estate tax.\n* Sue never exceeds the annual exclusion. She dies worth $10 million. No gift tax, but estate tax on the $4.55MM above the excess.\n* Marcus exceeds the annual exclusion twice, by giving $514K to each of his kids. He dies worth $5 million. Because his unified limit was reduced by the two large gifts, it's now $4.45MM; thus estate tax is owed on the remaining $550K\n* Susanne makes a gift of $10MM+$14K (her first time exceeding the annual exclusion). She will owe *gift* tax on the $4.55MM that exceeds her unified limit. In addition, her unified limit is reduced to $0; thus estate tax will be owed on her entire estate when she dies.", "id": "darhkev"}, {"comment": "Thank you for the reply.", "id": "darheqp"}], [{"comment": "Lawyer here - not licensed in Florida, so all I can say is hire a lawyer to find the best way to do this beforehand under Florida probate law.

I let them know in the exit interview it all came down to compensation. They asked how much more I was getting and I gave them a range % since some benefits were different. I heard from former co-workers that at the next annual evals that everyone in that branch saw significant bumps. Apparently the main office did their due diligence and shit their pants because they were worried of a mass exodus from underpaying most everyone there. So I helped some buddies and spurred some change. But I had already moved on.\n\nEdit: a word", "id": "daqow3s"}, {"comment": "Some companies have a no negotiation policy for internal moves only.

You shouldn't be asking *What should I budget?*, but rather *What can I afford to budget?*\n\nWhen it comes to food expenses, you'll need to decide what you can live with. When you are traveling, it's easy to spend $50/day per person on consumables - eating meals out, getting munchies, grabbing a beer, buying a bottled water. It adds up quick, but it's really easy to save some money with a bit planning. Bring a cooler, keep it stocked. You can bring munchies that travel well - cereal, peanut butter, granola bars, stuff like that. By preparing some of your own meals, you'll have more money for the fun stuff. \n\nBring your own car. For sure. It will give you a lot more freedom to explore and it will keep your expenses down. Also - road trips are fun. Personally, I never drive for more than about 4 hours without taking the time to see a sight. Our country is a big and beautiful place - why drive past it all, just to stop in a single place for a week?\n\nRooming and accommodations: Definitely a huge expense. Once again, decide what works best for you. Can the two of you stand to \"rough it\" for a couple of night? Maybe bring some camping gear or rent a stripped out cabin in some camping grounds, rather than paying full price for a room. Air BnB is also an option. \n\nAs for things to do...I just moved to Austin about a year ago. Here's some fun things I've done:\n\n1. Take a Segway tour of downtown. This was great fun. There are tours of different lengths and prices. We went by UT, the capitol building, and saw a lot of neat places to visit later on our own time.\n\n2. Visit the Oasis on a Friday night or Saturday evening. It's a beautiful shopping center on Lake Travis. The eatery (I forget its name) has a three-story outside deck that looks out onto the lake. On the weekends, there's live music. Very family oriented, but still a blast. I suggest going about 7 p.m., as they close at 10 p.m. It's a great way to start a night out, or to finish a night (if you are an \"early to bed\" couple).\n\n3. Visit Zilker Park's Botanical Garden. It's free, but parking costs a few bucks near the garden entrance. Well worth it. \n\n4. Go to Rudy's BBQ. Get the super-moist brisket. There are several locations around Austin. Rudy's one of those places that everyone in Austin visits at least once. \n\n5. Go downtown and drink on 6th Street. A ton of bars. I suggest just walking into one, taking a look around and deciding if you want to have a drink there. If it doesn't look like your kind of place, find another. 6th Street is the main \"drag\" for bars. You'll find every kind imaginable, styles from micro-brewery to pool hall to club to dive and everything else.\n\nOne last thing - I suggest coming in the spring. April and May are beautiful months here.

You shouldn't be asking *What should I budget?*, but rather *What can I afford to budget?*\n\nWhen it comes to food expenses, you'll need to decide what you can live with. When you are traveling, it's easy to spend $50/day per person on consumables - eating meals out, getting munchies, grabbing a beer, buying a bottled water. It adds up quick, but it's really easy to save some money with a bit planning. Bring a cooler, keep it stocked. You can bring munchies that travel well - cereal, peanut butter, granola bars, stuff like that. By preparing some of your own meals, you'll have more money for the fun stuff. \n\nBring your own car. For sure. It will give you a lot more freedom to explore and it will keep your expenses down. Also - road trips are fun. Personally, I never drive for more than about 4 hours without taking the time to see a sight. Our country is a big and beautiful place - why drive past it all, just to stop in a single place for a week?\n\nRooming and accommodations: Definitely a huge expense. Once again, decide what works best for you. Can the two of you stand to \"rough it\" for a couple of night? Maybe bring some camping gear or rent a stripped out cabin in some camping grounds, rather than paying full price for a room. Air BnB is also an option. \n\nAs for things to do...I just moved to Austin about a year ago. Here's some fun things I've done:\n\n1. Take a Segway tour of downtown. This was great fun. There are tours of different lengths and prices. We went by UT, the capitol building, and saw a lot of neat places to visit later on our own time.\n\n2. Visit the Oasis on a Friday night or Saturday evening. It's a beautiful shopping center on Lake Travis. The eatery (I forget its name) has a three-story outside deck that looks out onto the lake. On the weekends, there's live music. Very family oriented, but still a blast. I suggest going about 7 p.m., as they close at 10 p.m. It's a great way to start a night out, or to finish a night (if you are an \"early to bed\" couple).\n\n3. Visit Zilker Park's Botanical Garden. It's free, but parking costs a few bucks near the garden entrance. Well worth it. \n\n4. Go to Rudy's BBQ. Get the super-moist brisket. There are several locations around Austin. Rudy's one of those places that everyone in Austin visits at least once. \n\n5. Go downtown and drink on 6th Street. A ton of bars. I suggest just walking into one, taking a look around and deciding if you want to have a drink there. If it doesn't look like your kind of place, find another. 6th Street is the main \"drag\" for bars. You'll find every kind imaginable, styles from micro-brewery to pool hall to club to dive and everything else.\n\nOne last thing - I suggest coming in the spring. April and May are beautiful months here.

Find one that you think is reasonably priced, they have it listed for $14,000, and go into the dealership. Bonus if you're buying a Nissan at a non-Nissan dealer. Let them know that you're serious about buying the car, let them run your credit to prove it, and show them 3-4 others in the area that are similarly priced. Undercut their internet price by 15-20%, and negotiate from there. If they aren't willing to work with you, be COURTEOUS, RESPECTFUL, and leave your number. Thank the salesman for his time, and tell him you're going home to research a little more and think it over. Being unafraid to walk away is the greatest power that you have.

If you want a 2014 Altima with 30,000 miles for example, instead of buying a $2,000 extended warranty, why not just use that $2,000 to buy an Altima that is that much newer and has lower miles, not needing the warranty?!\n\nAlso, some places REALLY don't negotiate any more. With the internet giving us Edmunds, TrueCar, NADA, KBB, various owner forums telling each other what they paid, etc. then car haggling is much more of a science than it used to be.

You might be seen as a freak by your friends and neighbors if you don't take on a load of debt to get a car that's worth at least $21k (before you drive it off the car lot and it becomes instantly worth a chunk less). \n\nSo a compromise between waiting to get it when you can afford it, and getting it instantly when you want it and can't afford it, is to save up until you have that extra $5k to put towards it, and get it then, using a smaller loan.", "id": "dara5mo"}], [{"comment": "Do not buy a depreciating asset.

Despite the few years I wholly consumed myself in work (and even sometimes with that much work), I'd still manage to have fun. I'd talk with people, dated very understanding girls who actually respected someone looking towards the future, had roommates so I was also at least having some human contact outside of work, etc. When I scaled down hours I was still 110% at work in focus and drive, but also the same drive with my personal life (I'd go do things, I'd do more than sit around playing games or vegging out).\n\n\nPeople think work either consumes their life, halts the life, or is a burden on their life. It's not, it can truly be at least part of the whole with happiness and development. And people don't even realize that it often is even with their opposing attitude. People who complain about work throughout life often can objectively go back and see how many friends they made, connections they made, opportunities they got, companies or It's they moved to, skills they learned, even often spouse they found.\n\n\nYou're listing a dichotomy that doesn't HAVE to exist (and likely won't, but with the improper attitude you'll feel like it does), that you just end up a one dimensional person and end up with low retail pay forever. I'm not saying to work 100+ hours always, not even 40 really, that's just what I was mentioning what some should do when trying to hit temporary financial goals (like getting debt free). But even at 40 hours or less, there is great happiness in what's coined as \"adulting\" in culture today, and looked down upon as burdensome. I never bought into it.\n\n\nMy specific sacrifices were probably staying info so many work hours for so long, it took a bit of a toll on my body, not really from the hours but the focus. I didn't take as much interest as I should have with some simple things to balance out my focus, like eating more healthy. That's been corrected though and didn't really take up too much time. The other wasn't really a sacrifice but I kind of thought so at the time. Around that age everyone is telling you to have fun or travel or crap life that. Usually this is either from others that same age who think \"fun\" means the getting high, drunk, random sex, and clubbing every other night of the week. The other people it comes from are broke and unhappy old people whose life choice advice shouldn't be listened to, because they did the same. I didn't have a real grasp on what is \"fulfilling\" in life so I just thought (at the time I might be missing out on it. I did some of that stuff on rare occasion of course but I didn't make anywhere near a lifestyle of it. It turned out staying away from that actually LET me develop proper fulfillment values insured of just taking the advice of others.\n\n\nBefore starting the business at 22, I had already had all sorts of other jobs, and I had good work ethic and always tried to do a job above and beyond anyone else, even simple retail or service jobs. Everyone complains like you can't get ahead these days, but we truly live in a time where it's not only the easiest time to build a business, but even in labor jobs you actually stand put today as the cream of the crop by doing what used to be considered a bare minimum baseline. Seriously, dress nice, wear deodorant, wear a belt, smile and look people in the eyes, say thank you and you're welcome and actually assume gender by saying yes sir and no maam, and show up on time. That limited stuff now makes you highly valued, it's insane. Just that alone got me far in other jobs, but then when I actually attempted to do the jobs above and beyond, admired my work, and expressed interest in the job and advancement it would.just catapult me. Months into little retail or severe jobs and is be offered promotions and all sorts of things.\n\n\nMy main line of work in the business was a bit of a mingle of life to work, work to life fit. As to business grew I changed my life, and vice versa. But that's just the thing, by that point in life that sort of thinking was fading away, I didn't think in terms of work OR life, just life. It's all the same to me, whether I'm working, eating, learning a new skill, meeting with friends, relaxing, reading a book, taking a vacation, studying things that interest me, etc. Whether it's 6am on a Tuesday or Saturday, or 8pm Monday or Friday, it's all the same to me. What matters is if I'm nurturing my life as a whole, to be able to accomplish short term and long term goals, not just seeking happiness but knowing that actually doing these things IS part of that enjoyment of life, not just the means to happiness later.", "id": "dar47g1"}, {"comment": "Thanks for taking the time to write that, it's good to hear a more realistic version of finding happiness than just the typical \"love what you do and you'll never work a day...\".

It leads to this strange feeling all the time, I'm either feeling guilty for not working hard enough or I'm feeling guilty for not enjoying my life enough, again tying into the feeling that they are seperate.

My advice is for the student loans you have pay on the highest % interest. Start with paying the minimum on the others and much more on your highest % interest. With your salary depending on location your biggest hitter will be housing.

Weigh the time vs gas vs house/apartment payment options. \n\nEdit: I know your living with your parents for now but this is looking at if you ever choose to move out. Living with your parents for a year will save a lot of money to put towards student loans.\n\nAlso your company has a 401k matching % do the percent match because it's free money into your 401k. My company does 3% so I match with my check of 3%. Some have incremental up to cap of if you invest a further 3% they will match 1%. Options for people who are later in life closer to retirement.

I paid of $24,500 in 4 years (and that was with getting married thrown in). I graduated in 2012 with a Psychology degree...psychology...and had exactly 0 job prospects. I moved from GA to NC because that is where my then gf (now wife) lived. I had about 4k in savings when I first got out of school and due to my move and employment status I had to dip into savings by about $1,500 in 3 months to stay alive while I looked for work. I got a PT job to cut of my cash hemorrhage where I build back up my savings to $4500 (and 2-3k in checking). I got my first \"real\" job offer at about 35k and took it. This is where I would advise AGAINST what I did...I got engaged...I am not saying that I SHOULDN'T have gotten engaged but to those that have $4500 in savings and a few grand in checking should probably wait a little longer until their financial situation stabilizes. During all this time I made the minimum full monthly payment. I did not do income based repayment plans as I knew I would be paying it off anyways and to do so would just be pushing it off and allowing more interest to build. So we got married and had a deal with her dad that he would pay 5k for the wedding...we did it with 4k so that was a victory because everything over 5k we would've had to pay for. We spent about 3k on the honeymoon that we paid off between the engagement and wedding. So...once we were married we build our minimum savings up to around 8k and kept enough money in the checking to cover monthly bills. We were combined making probably 60k. We were contributing to our employer 401ks at the match level and we allowed that to be our primary savings for retirement. We then ASSAULTED my debt as aggressively as we could. Some months I would pay 8x the monthly payment. We also put a little extra money aside to make huge payments to the debt because it felt good to see it go down by 2k at once but also because we realized we may have been saving too much (I know that makes me sound like I am the spawn of satan around here but oh well). We put off buying a new house, new car, and even moved in with the in laws for awhile paying $400/mo rent. We just full court pressed that thing until it was paid and honestly I think that is the way to go. We paid the rest off with our tax return from last year and went out and bought our first house. Yes we have changed jobs since then and both make about 50k. We are prioritizing our debt even our 1.9% interest rate car loan. I think that living debt free while still saving for your retirement is the way to go if you can swing it.  "], [1, "Very very fast with ultra focused intensity. Declare war on This debt and Win! Send huge payments every month like 10x minimum payment at least! You can focking do it t19!"], [1, "If you are living with your parents for another year. You should live frugally as you did when you are a student to pay off a huge portion of your school debt within a year. "], [1, "My wife and I are living with her mom to pay down our student loan debt. The first thing to do is take an inventory of your loans so you know exactly what you're dealing with, and then decide what the best strategy is to pay them off.\n\nFor example: is the $25k a bunch of separate subsidized and unsubsidized loans? Is it mostly a collection of smaller federal loans and then a larger personal loan? Is it a refinanced lump sum total? Each scenario accrues interest in a different way, so the strategy would change.\n\nStep 1: make at least the minimum payment on everything to prevent accruing additional interest. Student loans are special in that they accrue interest daily, and the interest amount gets added to the principal amount very quickly. Factor this total as part of your monthly necessities. My wife's mother had consolidated ALL of my wife's loans (not recommended) so we had a 65k lump principle at 8% interest that was accruing almost $500/month in interest alone. Bad.\n\nStep 2: (if itemized) pick the loans accruing the most interest first by factoring their amount and their interest rate. Any additional money that you have per month should go to knocking this total down. Obviously, we had to target our $65k beast.. But once that's gone, we'll be able to chip away at mine that are still separate loans in smaller amounts.\n\nStep 3: since you're not paying rent, decide on an amount that would have been your rent and pay that on your targeted loan every month. We used to live in Chicago where rent was getting pretty expensive, so we factored with that. My monthly share of the rent was about $850/month: spread that out for the year and it's about $10k - so your $25k will be completely taken care of in 2 and a half years.\n\nStep 4: don't get discouraged, the most important piece of the equation is time. It's going to feel like nothing is happening, and you'll want it to go faster - but if you stick with it and watch your numbers, you'll be way better off than paying your minimum monthly payments for the rest of your life.\n"], [1, "I make 39k a year, which is recent for this year. The years ago, it was 35k. I loved on my own with a roommate and that cut my bills in half for two years. After taxes, my take home was around 24k at first and has moved up to around 27k. I was able to pay off 9.5k of my 20k total loan, just budgeting my salary without extra money added in. I did things like, being my lunch instead of eating out or having an Internet bill over having a cable bill (both is pointless). I believe my only monthly subscription is through Amazon. If you get my point, living at home should be used to pay off your debt. With a salary of 55k, I wouldn't doubt for a second that you could pay it off in 2 years, as long as major financial issues don't arise. The reason I recommend paying it off soon, the longer you pay, the more interest on the loan you pay. So, the longer it takes, the more money you end up paying. When you're debt free from a loan with high interest, which student loans usually are, your freed funds allow more investments. \nI ended up paying off my loan in less than 4 years, because I was injured at work and the workmans comp money finished it off for me. Not something I recommend either! However, it would have been paid off in another 2-3 years with my normal budgeting and extra work over those years that earned time and a half pay. \nBest of luck. "], [1, "You're in a great situation, and I admit my approach is a bit different than most on here would say. Since you do not have a high standard of living you are accustomed to, as you haven't graduated and started making money yet, I would plan to pay off the debt in full in one year. \n\nI choose this approach because debt makes me nervous. It feels like a dark cloud following me around, and my goal is always to remove it as quickly as possible. Then, a year from now when you are debt free, it will feel like you have received a $20,000 raise. Thus, here is how I would proceed if I were you.\n\nStep 1: Figure out your post-tax income.\n\nStep 2: Up front plan to put $2,000 a month into debt payments. This should get you debt free in 13 months.\n\nStep 3: Figure out how much you want to give away, if any. Never be a sporadic giver who gets guilted into giving money. Plan for this if it will be a part of your life. You can also choose to wait until debt is paid off to do this. However, don't plan to wait until you are making a bigger income to start giving. Become a percentage giver early on.\n\nStep 4: Figure out how much you want to save. Again, don't plan to start saving when you're making more money. Start percentage saving as early as possible. Plan to increase this percentage dramatically when student loan debts are paid off. Included in this category: save an emergency fund. Do not stop adding to this until you have 6 months living expenses saved up.\n\nStep 5: Live on the rest. If you are already paying off debt, giving, and saving, you have guilt free freedom to spend the rest of your money as you wish. Be smart about this and prioritize what will truly add to your life, rather than eating out once a day. Save for vacations, save for a car, buy new work clothes, whatever you need and want within your means. "], [1, "Are you in Ontario? I'm going to assume you are on OSAP. I have similar stats to you, living at home but I'm about a year into my budget. My loan was smaller ~22K and I'll be finish paying for it in November 2017.\n\n&nbsp;\nHonestly you can find a line of credit that's cheaper than OSAP rates and but I like the grace period OSAP provides. Starting out in your career you might switch jobs often and OSAP freezes the interest on your loan when you're jobless whereas a LOC will not do that. I've had 3 different jobs in the last year and having this perk makes it less stressful.\n\n&nbsp;\nAnyways if you're not on OSAP: I've looked into the flow charts provided here about where to prioritize your funds and generally it doesn't account for irresponsible decisions like having fun, buying a cool car or renting out a great apartment downtown in contrast of being frugal or \"smart\" with your money. My advice is to pay off what you can afford and save as much as you can. \n\n&nbsp;\nMy goal was to move out December 2017, save ~$20K and have paid off OSAP by then @ $1000/month. Could I exceed my goals and save up more money by then? Sure; but it'd be at the expense of stuff I enjoy. \n\n&nbsp;\nTips: Set the amount of your repayments to less than what you're willing for them to take out every month and send them the difference of what you can afford. Some cash-strapped months like December(Christmas), I wish I could've paid off less than I usually do but then again it teaches you how to be more responsible. Like for example if you're paying off you're loan @ $1000/month after you've gotten used to paying that amount and paid off your loan you can then start to invest at an additional $1000/month of what you're already saving. Open a TFSA and max that out, then I would do RRSP's to utilize the first-time home buyers perk ($25,000) which is non-taxable if repaid in 15 years. By the time you have maxed your TFSA, have $25,000 in your RRSP's, and found a mate to buy a house with; you should be well over your 20% down payment for your first home. At that point in time you can figure out how much of the downpayment you want to put down (>20%), how big of a house you want, or how big your crash fund should be, etc. \n&nbsp;\nWell that's my plan anyways...

My advice is for the student loans you have pay on the highest % interest. Start with paying the minimum on the others and much more on your highest % interest. With your salary depending on location your biggest hitter will be housing. Some places make sense getting a house for rent/buy over apartments other locations don't depending where you live find a place close to work that's not super expensive. Weigh the time vs gas vs house/apartment payment options. \n\nEdit: I know your living with your parents for now but this is looking at if you ever choose to move out. Living with your parents for a year will save a lot of money to put towards student loans.\n\nAlso your company has a 401k matching % do the percent match because it's free money into your 401k. My company does 3% so I match with my check of 3%. Some have incremental up to cap of if you invest a further 3% they will match 1%. Options for people who are later in life closer to retirement. You will want to do the minimum match to start. \n\nAlso when tax return comes around the following year go ahead and plan on using your return on your student loans.\n\nYour debt is rather low compared to most, but you can pay it off in  a year or two if you live frugally. Or you can live a little bit looser and still be able to do nice things just may take an extra few years. Don't worry about that part though cause your tax return based on student loan interest payments from above the government will usually give you back around 2-3k back a year ( note this is for claiming single and none also can depend on state laws) for that that's extra income. To put to student loans.\n\nMutual funds are good to get into but they usually require 10,000 or more to start. which starting after college you usually don't have that kind of money but when you can and can invest into without putting yourself in a bind.

I moved from GA to NC because that is where my then gf (now wife) lived. I had about 4k in savings when I first got out of school and due to my move and employment status I had to dip into savings by about $1,500 in 3 months to stay alive while I looked for work. I got a PT job to cut of my cash hemorrhage where I build back up my savings to $4500 (and 2-3k in checking). I got my first \"real\" job offer at about 35k and took it. This is where I would advise AGAINST what I did...I got engaged...I am not saying that I SHOULDN'T have gotten engaged but to those that have $4500 in savings and a few grand in checking should probably wait a little longer until their financial situation stabilizes. During all this time I made the minimum full monthly payment. I did not do income based repayment plans as I knew I would be paying it off anyways and to do so would just be pushing it off and allowing more interest to build. So we got married and had a deal with her dad that he would pay 5k for the wedding...we did it with 4k so that was a victory because everything over 5k we would've had to pay for. We spent about 3k on the honeymoon that we paid off between the engagement and wedding. So...once we were married we build our minimum savings up to around 8k and kept enough money in the checking to cover monthly bills. We were combined making probably 60k. We were contributing to our employer 401ks at the match level and we allowed that to be our primary savings for retirement. We then ASSAULTED my debt as aggressively as we could. Some months I would pay 8x the monthly payment. We also put a little extra money aside to make huge payments to the debt because it felt good to see it go down by 2k at once but also because we realized we may have been saving too much (I know that makes me sound like I am the spawn of satan around here but oh well). We put off buying a new house, new car, and even moved in with the in laws for awhile paying $400/mo rent. We just full court pressed that thing until it was paid and honestly I think that is the way to go. We paid the rest off with our tax return from last year and went out and bought our first house. Yes we have changed jobs since then and both make about 50k. We are prioritizing our debt even our 1.9% interest rate car loan.

", "id": "dap4n4r"}], [{"comment": "My wife and I are living with her mom to pay down our student loan debt. The first thing to do is take an inventory of your loans so you know exactly what you're dealing with, and then decide what the best strategy is to pay them off.\n\nFor example: is the $25k a bunch of separate subsidized and unsubsidized loans? Is it mostly a collection of smaller federal loans and then a larger personal loan? Is it a refinanced lump sum total? Each scenario accrues interest in a different way, so the strategy would change.\n\nStep 1: make at least the minimum payment on everything to prevent accruing additional interest. Student loans are special in that they accrue interest daily, and the interest amount gets added to the principal amount very quickly. Factor this total as part of your monthly necessities. My wife's mother had consolidated ALL of my wife's loans (not recommended) so we had a 65k lump principle at 8% interest that was accruing almost $500/month in interest alone. Bad.\n\nStep 2: (if itemized) pick the loans accruing the most interest first by factoring their amount and their interest rate. Any additional money that you have per month should go to knocking this total down. Obviously, we had to target our $65k beast.. But once that's gone, we'll be able to chip away at mine that are still separate loans in smaller amounts.\n\nStep 3: since you're not paying rent, decide on an amount that would have been your rent and pay that on your targeted loan every month. We used to live in Chicago where rent was getting pretty expensive, so we factored with that. My monthly share of the rent was about $850/month: spread that out for the year and it's about $10k - so your $25k will be completely taken care of in 2 and a half years.\n\nStep 4: don't get discouraged, the most important piece of the equation is time. It's going to feel like nothing is happening, and you'll want it to go faster - but if you stick with it and watch your numbers, you'll be way better off than paying your minimum monthly payments for the rest of your life.\n", "id": "dap65up"}], [{"comment": "I make 39k a year, which is recent for this year.

I was able to pay off 9.5k of my 20k total loan, just budgeting my salary without extra money added in. I did things like, being my lunch instead of eating out or having an Internet bill over having a cable bill (both is pointless). I believe my only monthly subscription is through Amazon. If you get my point, living at home should be used to pay off your debt. With a salary of 55k, I wouldn't doubt for a second that you could pay it off in 2 years, as long as major financial issues don't arise. The reason I recommend paying it off soon, the longer you pay, the more interest on the loan you pay. So, the longer it takes, the more money you end up paying. When you're debt free from a loan with high interest, which student loans usually are, your freed funds allow more investments. \nI ended up paying off my loan in less than 4 years, because I was injured at work and the workmans comp money finished it off for me.

Since you do not have a high standard of living you are accustomed to, as you haven't graduated and started making money yet, I would plan to pay off the debt in full in one year. \n\nI choose this approach because debt makes me nervous. It feels like a dark cloud following me around, and my goal is always to remove it as quickly as possible. Then, a year from now when you are debt free, it will feel like you have received a $20,000 raise. Thus, here is how I would proceed if I were you.\n\nStep 1: Figure out your post-tax income.\n\nStep 2: Up front plan to put $2,000 a month into debt payments. This should get you debt free in 13 months.\n\nStep 3: Figure out how much you want to give away, if any. Never be a sporadic giver who gets guilted into giving money. Plan for this if it will be a part of your life. You can also choose to wait until debt is paid off to do this. However, don't plan to wait until you are making a bigger income to start giving. Become a percentage giver early on.\n\nStep 4: Figure out how much you want to save. Again, don't plan to start saving when you're making more money. Start percentage saving as early as possible. Plan to increase this percentage dramatically when student loan debts are paid off. Included in this category: save an emergency fund. Do not stop adding to this until you have 6 months living expenses saved up.\n\nStep 5: Live on the rest. If you are already paying off debt, giving, and saving, you have guilt free freedom to spend the rest of your money as you wish. Be smart about this and prioritize what will truly add to your life, rather than eating out once a day.

I have similar stats to you, living at home but I'm about a year into my budget. My loan was smaller ~22K and I'll be finish paying for it in November 2017.\n\n&nbsp;\nHonestly you can find a line of credit that's cheaper than OSAP rates and but I like the grace period OSAP provides. Starting out in your career you might switch jobs often and OSAP freezes the interest on your loan when you're jobless whereas a LOC will not do that. I've had 3 different jobs in the last year and having this perk makes it less stressful.\n\n&nbsp;\nAnyways if you're not on OSAP: I've looked into the flow charts provided here about where to prioritize your funds and generally it doesn't account for irresponsible decisions like having fun, buying a cool car or renting out a great apartment downtown in contrast of being frugal or \"smart\" with your money. My advice is to pay off what you can afford and save as much as you can. \n\n&nbsp;\nMy goal was to move out December 2017, save ~$20K and have paid off OSAP by then @ $1000/month. Could I exceed my goals and save up more money by then? Sure; but it'd be at the expense of stuff I enjoy. \n\n&nbsp;\nTips: Set the amount of your repayments to less than what you're willing for them to take out every month and send them the difference of what you can afford. Some cash-strapped months like December(Christmas), I wish I could've paid off less than I usually do but then again it teaches you how to be more responsible. Like for example if you're paying off you're loan @ $1000/month after you've gotten used to paying that amount and paid off your loan you can then start to invest at an additional $1000/month of what you're already saving. Open a TFSA and max that out, then I would do RRSP's to utilize the first-time home buyers perk ($25,000) which is non-taxable if repaid in 15 years. By the time you have maxed your TFSA, have $25,000 in your RRSP's, and found a mate to buy a house with; you should be well over your 20% down payment for your first home. At that point in time you can figure out how much of the downpayment you want to put down (>20%), how big of a house you want, or how big your crash fund should be, etc. \n&nbsp;\nWell that's my plan anyways... Try to remember that it's a long-term goal and you shouldn't beat yourself up if you fall outside your budget.

First, I don't have a degree. I went to an expensive private school, changed majors a couple times, not doing well at all in my prerequisite classes, and eventually dropped out. I started working my way up and figuring out what I wanted to do. I now work in IT for law enforcement and am starting to win the eye of nearby agencies, a couple who have started sending me job offers. More importantly, I genuinely love my job. \n\nHere's how I got here. I spent probably ten years after dropping out of school trying to figure out what I want to do. I started at a computer shop fixing viruses and stuff like that. It was a challenge and I felt pretty cool. I liked my coworkers and I got to play lots of video games. I loved it... for a few years. At that point, I started to want more. I was thinking, \"man, if I could find a job where I make 30k/yr I'll be set! But IT is unattainable because I'm not smart enough and I didn't finish college.\" That held me there for a while and I got depressed. I didn't understand why. I loved computers. Everyone was telling me \"do what you love and you will never work a day in your life.\" This idea of following your passion that everyone says is te secret to happiness wasn't working! Then I took the other piece of advice that everyone gives - \"just get your foot in the door.\" An opportunity presented itself to move to a large organization who builds slot machines. They wanted people with computer experience because slots were becoming Windows based. That was my ticket to a real IT department! Yeah, that job sucked too. It was the typical golden shackles corporation. You must make major sacrifices for minimal gains, just to try to get a small step ahead of the competition only to find out that your hard work and dedication means nothing when someone else has a personal connection with the hiring manager. At that point I decided to ignore everyone's advice and do what felt good. I made my own rules that went something like this: \n\n 1: Promotions are a waste of time. The way to make more money is to change jobs and move upward each time (this rule has it's limits and I am no longer following it)\n\n2. Always apply for jobs that I am under qualified for. Since I am getting my training on the job, I need to be challenged and I need room to grow. \n\n3. I need to find another job that I love. I'm not going to look for jobs that are \"doing my time\", a \"foot in the door\", or \"resume material\". \n\n4. Always look for a job before I need one. Don't wait until I'm laid off or need to make more money to survive. Being able to walk away is incredible for negotiating your starting contract. \n\nThis was more of a change in attitude than anything. I was suddenly much more confident and was now looking for a job that fit me instead of looking for a job that I got into. I began looking at interviews as me interviewing employers instead of them interviewing me. I had a friend who had an IT job at a casino. He put in a good word for me which got me a graphic design job there. I had a little photoshop experience so why not? They asked me to do a Flash based animation and I said \"yeah, I can do that.\" I had never even opened flash, but that night I watched enough tutorials to get through and land the job. I did design for them for a couple years and helped my friend out with IT in the process. I learned then that I'm not good at design but I can convince people that I am. I also learned that I don't like design. So it was time to move on. I applied for an IT job at a tv station. I used my IT help at the casino as experience to say I knew what I was doing, and I demanded a better deal than what they were offering. That made it a good move up and I took the job. \n\nThis was my first real IT job and it was a promising career. There were people high up in IT who made hundreds of thousands. But it wasn't long until I realized I wasn't happy here either. I didn't like the micro-management and I wasn't generally fulfilled. I also felt like I had maxed out my growth in the position and moving up in the company would mean moving to a new city. I didn't want that so it was time to move on. I applied for my current job, which is essentially the same work but for a different company. It was a small step up in pay. When I announced that I was leaving the tv station they offered me a 10k raise to stay. I had no intention of taking it, but I told my new employer about it. They were already heavily invested in me so they matched it as my starting wage. That just meant I would cap out sooner, which meant I would need to start planning for a re-class right away. \n\nAnd now here I am. I am doing something I never thought I could do, I have a promising career with a lot of opportunity, my experience now speaks louder on a resume than my poor education. I make far more than the 30k I used to dream of. And I genuinely love my job. \n\nDoing what you love is the last part I want to talk about, and probably the most important. It's a lie. If you simply try to do what you love, you will find yourself hating what you used to love. I hated my last job but love this one, yet the day to day work is pretty much the same. The difference is that this job provides fulfillment. It gives me a sense of pride. I love that my work helps save lives and rescue people from domestic violence and keep people safe, where before doing my job well helped put fuel in a CEOs private jet. I am trusted to be an expert and I have to own my successes and failures. I have many possible paths going forward, and none of them have ceilings or bs corporate hurdles. My growth is only limited by my drive. These are the things that make me happy with my job and none of them have to do with computers. In fact, that passion is dead. I haven't turned my home computer on in months. It runs like shit and my family complains about that, but  I've lost my passion for computers altogether. Yet, I still love my job.\n\nYou can find what you are looking for if I can. You have a major leg up on me, which is a degree. It is hard to get interviews without one. But you do not have to apply for jobs that align with your degree. Apply for jobs that you think might be interesting. If they feel good, go for it. You will get there quicker than you think. My whole story took ten years. \n\nTL;DR Throw out all the advice of \"do what you love\" and \"just get your foot in the door.\" Do what you are good at and find an environment that provides you with the qualities that important to you. Don't worry about what field your degree is in, it doesn't matter. Just do what you are good at, and you will be able to take what you want.  "], [7, "Project Manager.

Military service is something that you need to plan into your career. \n\nOfficer experience is great, if your goal is a particular job is in the military.  If your end goal is a job in the private sector... you're putting off your real career for 6-8 years at a minimum.

Tho combat engineer is a terribly boring MOS with a lot of terrible moments.  If you don't go to school for civil engineering or something construction... you're not in a better position when you leave the military.  A career like IT specialist is great for enlisted personal, but not everyone qualifies for those.  Remember the benefits weren't that good until the post 911 GI bill under Bush.

First, I don't have a degree. I went to an expensive private school, changed majors a couple times, not doing well at all in my prerequisite classes, and eventually dropped out. I started working my way up and figuring out what I wanted to do. I now work in IT for law enforcement and am starting to win the eye of nearby agencies, a couple who have started sending me job offers. More importantly, I genuinely love my job. \n\nHere's how I got here. I spent probably ten years after dropping out of school trying to figure out what I want to do. I started at a computer shop fixing viruses and stuff like that. It was a challenge and I felt pretty cool. I liked my coworkers and I got to play lots of video games. I loved it... for a few years. At that point, I started to want more. I was thinking, \"man, if I could find a job where I make 30k/yr I'll be set! But IT is unattainable because I'm not smart enough and I didn't finish college.\" That held me there for a while and I got depressed. I didn't understand why. I loved computers. Everyone was telling me \"do what you love and you will never work a day in your life.\" This idea of following your passion that everyone says is te secret to happiness wasn't working! Then I took the other piece of advice that everyone gives - \"just get your foot in the door.\" An opportunity presented itself to move to a large organization who builds slot machines. They wanted people with computer experience because slots were becoming Windows based. That was my ticket to a real IT department! Yeah, that job sucked too. It was the typical golden shackles corporation. You must make major sacrifices for minimal gains, just to try to get a small step ahead of the competition only to find out that your hard work and dedication means nothing when someone else has a personal connection with the hiring manager. At that point I decided to ignore everyone's advice and do what felt good. I made my own rules that went something like this: \n\n 1: Promotions are a waste of time. The way to make more money is to change jobs and move upward each time (this rule has it's limits and I am no longer following it)\n\n2. Always apply for jobs that I am under qualified for. Since I am getting my training on the job, I need to be challenged and I need room to grow. \n\n3. I need to find another job that I love. I'm not going to look for jobs that are \"doing my time\", a \"foot in the door\", or \"resume material\". \n\n4. Always look for a job before I need one. Don't wait until I'm laid off or need to make more money to survive. Being able to walk away is incredible for negotiating your starting contract. \n\nThis was more of a change in attitude than anything. I was suddenly much more confident and was now looking for a job that fit me instead of looking for a job that I got into. I began looking at interviews as me interviewing employers instead of them interviewing me. I had a friend who had an IT job at a casino. He put in a good word for me which got me a graphic design job there. I had a little photoshop experience so why not? They asked me to do a Flash based animation and I said \"yeah, I can do that.\" I had never even opened flash, but that night I watched enough tutorials to get through and land the job. I did design for them for a couple years and helped my friend out with IT in the process. I learned then that I'm not good at design but I can convince people that I am. I also learned that I don't like design. So it was time to move on. I applied for an IT job at a tv station. I used my IT help at the casino as experience to say I knew what I was doing, and I demanded a better deal than what they were offering. That made it a good move up and I took the job. \n\nThis was my first real IT job and it was a promising career. There were people high up in IT who made hundreds of thousands. But it wasn't long until I realized I wasn't happy here either. I didn't like the micro-management and I wasn't generally fulfilled. I also felt like I had maxed out my growth in the position and moving up in the company would mean moving to a new city. I didn't want that so it was time to move on. I applied for my current job, which is essentially the same work but for a different company. It was a small step up in pay. When I announced that I was leaving the tv station they offered me a 10k raise to stay. I had no intention of taking it, but I told my new employer about it. They were already heavily invested in me so they matched it as my starting wage. That just meant I would cap out sooner, which meant I would need to start planning for a re-class right away. \n\nAnd now here I am. I am doing something I never thought I could do, I have a promising career with a lot of opportunity, my experience now speaks louder on a resume than my poor education. I make far more than the 30k I used to dream of. And I genuinely love my job. \n\nDoing what you love is the last part I want to talk about, and probably the most important. It's a lie. If you simply try to do what you love, you will find yourself hating what you used to love. I hated my last job but love this one, yet the day to day work is pretty much the same. The difference is that this job provides fulfillment. It gives me a sense of pride. I love that my work helps save lives and rescue people from domestic violence and keep people safe, where before doing my job well helped put fuel in a CEOs private jet. I am trusted to be an expert and I have to own my successes and failures. I have many possible paths going forward, and none of them have ceilings or bs corporate hurdles. My growth is only limited by my drive. These are the things that make me happy with my job and none of them have to do with computers. In fact, that passion is dead. I haven't turned my home computer on in months. It runs like shit and my family complains about that, but  I've lost my passion for computers altogether. Yet, I still love my job.\n\nYou can find what you are looking for if I can. You have a major leg up on me, which is a degree. It is hard to get interviews without one. But you do not have to apply for jobs that align with your degree. Apply for jobs that you think might be interesting. If they feel good, go for it. You will get there quicker than you think. My whole story took ten years. \n\nTL;DR Throw out all the advice of \"do what you love\" and \"just get your foot in the door.\" Do what you are good at and find an environment that provides you with the qualities that important to you. Don't worry about what field your degree is in, it doesn't matter. Just do what you are good at, and you will be able to take what you want.  ", "id": "daph2ot"}], [{"comment": "Project Manager.

So, you would take the money out of the savings account and put in those relatively low risk ETFs?

A good savings account will make 1-2%/yr with no risk of losing any money. A bond ETF will usually pay 3-4%/yr as dividends and the price of the ETF will stay relatively stable. They grow a bit every year on average, but they can also go down a bit too. An equity ETF averages 5-8%/yr but they can really fluctuate. I have some investments that are sitting at -6% right now.

They offered a 3 month salary bonus to anyone who was there to 'turn the lights out' at the 12 month mark.\n\nTowards the end I was getting nervous about timing and I knew that 3 months would be for nothing if it took me 3 months to get a job.

I thought about the job fair, and the 3 months bonus...   When the light turned green I turned right instead of left.  I went to the job fair instead of the office.\n\nThat allowed me to meet the man who is my current boss.  That was 6 years ago, I am being paid 30% more than my old job (so I make that \"3 month bonus\" every year!) in a job that I love.\n\nMany decisions led me here.  The decision to go to the job fair, sure.  But also, the decision to NOT go to the prior 2 job fairs where I might have found a job that was better, or worse, etc.   Who can say?\n\nSounds like you are happy where you are now.
