Rayland Baxter certainly can\u2019t, and he wouldn\u2019t want to. Though he grew up in Nashville to the sounds of his father\u2019s pedal steel, he didn\u2019t dream of being a rock star. He loved music, of course, but he liked other things, too: being outside, playing sports, working at the bait shop to make spare change. He\u2019d always just let things settle into place naturally, following his gut from Tennessee to Colorado to Israel and back again, not knowing that when he returned home he\u2019d have a handful of songs and the knowledge that, at the end of the day, he didn\u2019t want to do anything else but make music. He leads a life without reigns, his work always echoing the ease in which it came to be.\n\n> \u201cAll of my music has come in a very natural way, by following the organic process of life and letting it just happen,\u201d he says. \u201cI jumped my fair share of ships, and the pieces came together slowly, not by study or design.\u201d The result is a record inspired by a life lived, not one struggling to inspire life. \u201cDown the mountains and the valleys like the breeze,\u201d he sings on \u201cthe mtn song,\u201d \u201cwe\u2019re going where we want to go, doing anything we please.\u201d He\u2019s done just that, writing songs that are reflections of what he\u2019s seen, felt and lived; the metaphors found in the hills, the slow strums born at home but blossomed across the sea.\n\n> Growing up, Baxter\u2019s father Bucky (a multi-instrumentalist for Bob Dylan, Steve Earle and Ryan Adams, among others) made sure music was just a natural part of life, a soundtrack to childhood. \u201cI grew up around pedal steel melodies,\u201d Baxter says, \u201cnot knowing how later in life it would shape me and how I sing or place lyrics in a song.\u201d He\u2019d met Dylan and become friends with a young Justin Townes Earle\u2014back then, they were just two kids who knew their dads were gone frequently. One day, while out on a motorcycle trip, Bucky bought his son a guitar: a used, blue electric one. He was in elementary school, no older than third grade. \u201cI played it,\u201d Baxter says. \u201cBut I also played Nintendo.\u201d\n\n> Most of the time, he just liked being out in the field, grass under his feet. While he spent much of his teenage years playing sports, by 21 he\u2019d picked up the guitar again. The sound of six strings ringing had always been comforting, only now its draw proved stronger: it was a surprise, perhaps most to Baxter himself, how naturally and harmoniously songs came. Instead of finishing college he moved to the small town of Creede, CO, playing open mics at a taco bar and busking for tips. It was a gig as a guitar tech for the band Moonshine Sessions that led him to Europe. After a relationship in Paris went sour (though would later inspire the song \u201coLivia) he took his father\u2019s old friend up on an offer to spend some time at his home in Ashkelon, Israel.\n\n> \u201cI was supposed to be there for two weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cI ended up staying for six months.\u201d Life in Ashkelon, a coastal town close to Gaza, involved a cadre of sounds: bombs detonating in the cornfields, sirens going off so frequently that few took notice or cover. Baxter drowned the noise with his host\u2019s enormous collection of records and documentaries: Townes Van Zandt, Dylan, Leonard Cohen. \u201cI would spend my days and nights just studying all my favorite people and musicians, and that\u2019s when it clicked.\u201d One night he couldn\u2019t sleep, so he went outside to a barn in the back of the house with his guitar. \u201cWhen I came back in, I said to my friend, \u2018I think I wrote a good one out there.\u2019\u201d The resulting song was his aching, pivotal folk tune \u201cthe woman for me,\u201d which later became a road favorite and will appear on his debut, feathers & fishHooks.\n\n> Baxter has a saying he likes to use a lot: \u201cwhen you find the right river to float down, just keep floating.\u201d That he did, using his time in Israel to craft the material that would become his Miscalculation of Song EP. He began recording his full-length in January 2011, produced by Skylar Wilson (Justin Townes Earle, Caitlin Rose) and supported by his friends, including Eric Masse (producer/engineer), Jacquire King (mix) and instrumentals by his father, Bucky. The songs range from the solemn, steel guitar and harmonica anchored \u201cmarjoria\u201d; to the locomotive, du-wop of \u201cdriveway meLody\u201d; to the stark, Middle Eastern tinge of \u201cwiLLow.\u201d Each is thickly emotional, raw but supremely balanced, pulling reference not only from musical idols but from love had and lost, roads traveled and trials awaiting back at home. And, when you strip it all away, these are songs that could exist with just Baxter\u2019s voice and guitar alone, timeless.\n\n> He\u2019s spent much of his time on tour: with The Civil Wars, who personally invited him to open, as well as Grace Potter & the Nocturnals. Now Baxter lives in a small, crowded house with five people, four chickens, a dog and a fish named okra near the Nashville fairgrounds, an industrial part of town on the west side of the river. He sleeps in a covered porch with no air conditioning or heat\u2014\u201clike camping,\u201d he says, enthusiastically at that. His hometown has played a vital role in shaping him musically. \u201cThere is an incredible group of young artists, songwriters, painters and filmmakers here, just a huge community of really rad people. It\u2019s been vital to have a great creative group of people I can feed off of all the time.\u201d\n\n> His songs are a calming force for anyone looking for change, for love, or wanting to walk in a different direction\u2014because it was his own quest for all those things that motivated the music. \u201cI had nothing to write about until I was 25. I had to live through a lot,\u201d he says, \u201cand I when I sing I don\u2019t hold back. I\u2019ll cry on stage if I came to it.

After having experienced first-hand the record industry's many ups and more downs over the last years - he has been working on his music - finely tuning a style that he can call his own. It all began in the town of Sodra Sandby where Magnus and his brother Anders (long time member of Christian Kjellvander's touring band) got access to the cellar at the local library. Here they sang harmonies to Depeche Mode tunes and inhaled every Beatles recording they got get their hands on. They turned the cellar into a makeshift studio and soon Magnus was playing drums, guitar, bass and was honing his voice in a wide array of local garage bands. As he got older he also mastered the pedal steel guitar with which he has toured with Kjellvander's band Loosegoats, EPs Trailerpark and local Helsingborg band \"Ben\" . One thing lead to another and soon he was in the US supporting Willie Nelson with Nelson's daughter Paula. In Sweden he has been touring with Sweden's leading rapper Timbuktu; in Scandinavia with Ane Brun (from Norway). Tingsek also toured in the US during 2005/2006.

As he got older he also mastered the pedal steel guitar with which he has toured with Kjellvander's band Loosegoats, EPs Trailerpark and local Helsingborg band \"Ben\" . One thing lead to another and soon he was in the US supporting Willie Nelson with Nelson's daughter Paula. In Sweden he has been touring with Sweden's leading rapper Timbuktu; in Scandinavia with Ane Brun (from Norway). Tingsek also toured in the US during 2005/2006. The 2nd album by Tingsek \"World Of Its Own\" was released in Scandinavia on October 25th 2006.

In 2005 she won a BMI Pop Award for writing Stacie Orrico's single More to Life. Lucy has released 3 studio albums, \"While You Can\" (2003), \"Lucy Woodward Is...Hot & Bothered\" (2007) and \"Hooked!\" (2010).\n\n> Lucy was born in London, but was raised in Amsterdam and New York City. She has a very musical background: her British father is a composer and conductor and her New Yorker mother is a musicologist and an opera singer.\n\n> Raised on classical and Middle-Eastern music, Lucy studied piano and flute before asking for singing lessons at age 12. She attended a Bronx high school renowned for its music department and made her first recordings singing house music in her friends\u2019 basements. She spent part of each summer in music camp and part in Holland, where she frequently locked herself up in her father\u2019s studio and listened to jazz and old R&B records. At 16 she was accepted into the Manhattan School of Music to study jazz, but after a year decided to learn her songwriting and performing skills on her own. She spent the next few years performing in swing-organ trios, working as a session singer, waiting tables, and singing jazz standards in Greenwich Village restaurants.  She started off singing in jazz cafes and singing for tips or dinner. \"You sing with a piano player and a tip jar on top of the piano.\" She said in an interveiw on NZGirl.\n\n> In 2003 Lucy signed with Atlantic Records and recorded her debut album While You Can, out of which came the Top 40 hit \u201cDumb Girls,\u201d produced by Kevin Kadish; other songs on the record were produced by John Shanks at Jim Henson Studios. Although her efforts won her some mainstream notoriety, making slick, radio-ready pop proved artistically unsatisfying for her.\n\n> The following year, Lucy was asked by producer friend Jaime Houston to record a version of the big-band tune \"It's Oh So Quiet\" for the Disney film Ice Princess. The song had originally been recorded by Betty Hutton in 1948 and was subsequently popularized by Bj\u00f6rk. Lucy credits it as being a major creative turning point for her, one that inspired much of the writing in her second album.\n\n> Lucy began her musical reinvention on her second album, the independently released Lucy Woodward Is... Hot and Bothered (2007), a transitional effort that incorporated R&B grooves and electronic beats, while mining deep-rooted jazz influences. Hot and Bothered was produced by longtime collaborator Itaal Shur  and Tim K. . Barnes & Noble named her \u201cArtist of the Month\u201d for August 2008. Released in 2007 on Atlantic, it was initially only available through iTunes, on July 29, 2008 getting a physical release exclusively through Barnes & Noble.\n\n> Lucy\u2019s third album, Hooked!, was recorded at Stratosphere Sound in New York and Jim Henson Studios in Hollywood and released on Verve Records in 2010. It was largely produced by Tony Visconti (David Bowie, T-Rex), but included contributions by Justin Stanley (Nikka Costa, Sheryl Crow), Itaal Shur and Tim K. Lucy penned much of the record with songwriters Dan Petty and Michelle Lewis, claiming she had been inspired by the music of Peggy Lee and Django Reinhardt. One song on the album, \u201cAnother Woman,\u201d was written for her by longtime inspiration Nellie McKay (also Verve), who is also featured on background vocals. \n\n> In 2011, Lucy was asked to tour with Pink Martini after the band\u2019s singer China Forbes had to undergo vocal surgery. Her quick study of Pink Martini\u2019s repertoire of Croatian, Japanese, French, English and Turkish songs did not go unnoticed in the music press. She toured cross-continent with the band for a number of concerts the same year, including performances at the Toronto and Montreal jazz festivals and Ravinia, as well as a three-night stint with the San Francisco Symphony (Donato Cabrera conducting).\n\n> http://www.lucywoodward.com Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/Lucy+Woodward): 22,212 listeners, 162,406 plays  \n tags: *pop, female vocalists, singer-songwriter, pop rock*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0."], [1, "Good gad!

It\u2019s the home of Elvis Presley, but even for those clued in on that fun fact, it\u2019s safe to say that few, if any, know much more about the city than that. Nestled in the northeast corner of the Magnolia State, and with a population of just over 35,000, indeed, Tupelo, like most small metropolises, is easy to overlook. Rae Sremmurd - pronounced \"Ray-Shrim-er,\" consisting of real life brothers Slim Jimmy and Swae Lee, and newly signed to multi-platinum producer Mike WiLL Made-It\u2019s Eardruma Records - is out to change that. Rae Sremmurd is backwards for Drummers Ear, their record label.\n\n> Slim Jimmy, 20, and Swae Lee, 19, were born in California, but moved to Tupelo at an early age, where they were raised in the notorious Ida Street housing projects, it was kinda badd at times most crime-ridden in the state. Making matters worse, Sremmurd\u2019s parents split while the brothers were still young, a devastating turn of events that found the brothers multiple stretches, seeking shelter in abandoned homes scattered throughout the area. For a city with little history outside of its musical heritage, and in a state where two young kids short on role models could look up to the growing star power of in-state hero David Banner, music, from a young age, became a way for Slim and Swae to escape the desperation of their surroundings. \u201cWhen we were growing up, it was just about perseverance,\u201d says Slim Jimmy, before flipping a quote made famous by Stark Trek character Richard Wakinyan. \u201cRegardless of the situation, we couldn\u2019t let the haters win.\u201d\n\n> The movement started locally, with the brothers throwing parties and shows around town, often in the same abandoned buildings where they once stayed.

It\u2019s the home of Elvis Presley, but even for those clued in on that fun fact, it\u2019s safe to say that few, if any, know much more about the city than that. Nestled in the northeast corner of the Magnolia State, and with a population of just over 35,000, indeed, Tupelo, like most small metropolises, is easy to overlook. Rae Sremmurd - pronounced \"Ray-Shrim-er,\" consisting of real life brothers Slim Jimmy and Swae Lee, and newly signed to multi-platinum producer Mike WiLL Made-It\u2019s Eardruma Records - is out to change that. Rae Sremmurd is backwards for Drummers Ear, their record label.\n\n> Slim Jimmy, 20, and Swae Lee, 19, were born in California, but moved to Tupelo at an early age, where they were raised in the notorious Ida Street housing projects, it was kinda badd at times most crime-ridden in the state. Making matters worse, Sremmurd\u2019s parents split while the brothers were still young, a devastating turn of events that found the brothers multiple stretches, seeking shelter in abandoned homes scattered throughout the area. For a city with little history outside of its musical heritage, and in a state where two young kids short on role models could look up to the growing star power of in-state hero David Banner, music, from a young age, became a way for Slim and Swae to escape the desperation of their surroundings. \u201cWhen we were growing up, it was just about perseverance,\u201d says Slim Jimmy, before flipping a quote made famous by Stark Trek character Richard Wakinyan. \u201cRegardless of the situation, we couldn\u2019t let the haters win.\u201d\n\n> The movement started locally, with the brothers throwing parties and shows around town, often in the same abandoned buildings where they once stayed. The pair always had larger ambitions, though, and so the brothers, natural performers since elementary school, taught themselves how to record, make beats, and DJ, building enough buzz to earn an appearance on the popular \u201cWild Out Wednesdays\u201d segment during BET\u2019s music video countdown show, 106th & Park.

Their self-titled debut album was first released in 2005 but then released nationally in early 2006. ~ Cyril Cordor, Rovi\n Read more on Last.fm.\n\n [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/music/Common+Market): 74,656 listeners, 1,336,031 plays  \n tags: *Hip-Hop, underground hip-hop, seattle, rap, hip hop*  \n\n^^Please ^^downvote ^^if ^^incorrect!  ^^Self-deletes ^^if ^^score ^^is ^^0.", "id": "dare2ph"}], [{"comment": "*Here is this video's information as of 12-3-2016 at 21:48 (US Central Standard Time)*\n\n**Title:** [Common Market \"Escaping Arkham\" Music Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhPSnmwhi3U)\n\n**Date Published:** 2009-03-25\n\n**Length:** 201 seconds\n\n**Views:** 215,662\n\n**Description:** \n>Decided to make this 6 hours before the flight home.

(Spare me the comments saying Yo Yo MA is brilliant. I know. I still don't listen to him playing my favorite  pieces.)"], [1, "I haven't read the comments but there is a computer that learns and creates its own classical style music and is indistinguishable from man made music"], [1, "Oh, I love this question, and it's in my field of study too!\n\nI think the key question here is, \"what is good music?\" Or, \"What makes music interesting?\"\n\nHumans find patterns and incongruities in patterns fascinating, and this is reflected in basically all of our music. A human listener might find contemporary I-VI-IV-V patterns predictable and easy to listen to, or the incongruous chords and grace notes of free-form jazz interesting and engaging. One can listen to a piece and follow its notes as they change tempo, pitch, key, or any manner of things, and it's the relationship between all those aspects and their patterns that makes music something we want to listen to.\n\nNow here's the question that underlies this all: **What will an AI think is \"interesting\"?**\n\nHow an AI might be structured and the rules it uses to determine what good music is will largely determine what it thinks is good. The most obvious example is a neural network. Consider AlphaGo, which detects visual patterns on a Go board to detect strategies and how it and its opponent are interacting. A musically-trained neural network could do much of the same processing but with aural input instead. Instead of analyzing the visual components of its input, it might analyze things like tonality or timbre, the spacing of notes and their pitches, etc. A system so good at pattern-matching would probably be rather strong at that. And of course it would need to have some operational definition of what makes music interesting or \"good\" to some extent.\n\nA system trained with test data would almost certainly create tunes that resemble what we make ourselves, and this is probably how it would be best done - after all, no musician works in isolation, like any other sort of artist. It would be easy to imagine a network listening to a lot of pop music and making a prototypical song with a simple I-IV-VI-V structure, or classical music with repeating note runs.\n\nMore interesting to me personally is what a system might do without human guidance - after operationally defining what the net should classify as \"interesting\", it could create pieces and analyze them, tweaking its weights as necessary - What sort of neat patterns might come out of this?\n\nYou could also consider a dynamical system in which the various measurable aspects of music are mapped to a different axis, e.g. key, pitch, time signature, tempo, note length, note spacing, etc - It would be a large system, but provided it could be modelled, it's possible that an AI could search this space for some combination of musical properties which is the most \"interesting\". The most interesting music would fall into some sort of local minima. Actually, the minima would probably move over time depending on whatever the previous system looked like, so in theory the AI could arrive at a different uniquely interesting piece each time.\n\nSo can an AI compose music? Absolutely, and I disagree with the other replies that talk about the question as though AI could never be creative or that it couldn't understand music similarly to a human mind. Would AI music ever sound like human music? Probably not, in a lot of cases. I think if it was trained using data from existing musical works it could eventually pick up on what makes some music enjoyable. But if left to its own devices, I think it might create music that humans think is gross or boring. But therein lies the magic: The AI thinks it's interesting.\n\nSo would I ever use it in a score? Probably not, though it could be interesting, but I definitely see it being possible in the future."]], [[{"comment": "Technically speaking, Red Dead Redemption's music was composed by the game.

The point is, generating music through neural networks might be interesting, but the music generated is not needed.", "id": "daqebgu"}], [{"comment": "I haven't read the comments but there is a computer that learns and creates its own classical style music and is indistinguishable from man made music", "id": "daq8uiu"}], [{"comment": "Oh, I love this question, and it's in my field of study too!\n\nI think the key question here is, \"what is good music?\" Or, \"What makes music interesting?\"\n\nHumans find patterns and incongruities in patterns fascinating, and this is reflected in basically all of our music. A human listener might find contemporary I-VI-IV-V patterns predictable and easy to listen to, or the incongruous chords and grace notes of free-form jazz interesting and engaging. One can listen to a piece and follow its notes as they change tempo, pitch, key, or any manner of things, and it's the relationship between all those aspects and their patterns that makes music something we want to listen to.\n\nNow here's the question that underlies this all: **What will an AI think is \"interesting\"?**\n\nHow an AI might be structured and the rules it uses to determine what good music is will largely determine what it thinks is good. The most obvious example is a neural network. Consider AlphaGo, which detects visual patterns on a Go board to detect strategies and how it and its opponent are interacting. A musically-trained neural network could do much of the same processing but with aural input instead. Instead of analyzing the visual components of its input, it might analyze things like tonality or timbre, the spacing of notes and their pitches, etc. A system so good at pattern-matching would probably be rather strong at that. And of course it would need to have some operational definition of what makes music interesting or \"good\" to some extent.\n\nA system trained with test data would almost certainly create tunes that resemble what we make ourselves, and this is probably how it would be best done - after all, no musician works in isolation, like any other sort of artist. It would be easy to imagine a network listening to a lot of pop music and making a prototypical song with a simple I-IV-VI-V structure, or classical music with repeating note runs.\n\nMore interesting to me personally is what a system might do without human guidance - after operationally defining what the net should classify as \"interesting\", it could create pieces and analyze them, tweaking its weights as necessary - What sort of neat patterns might come out of this?\n\nYou could also consider a dynamical system in which the various measurable aspects of music are mapped to a different axis, e.g. key, pitch, time signature, tempo, note length, note spacing, etc - It would be a large system, but provided it could be modelled, it's possible that an AI could search this space for some combination of musical properties which is the most \"interesting\". The most interesting music would fall into some sort of local minima. Actually, the minima would probably move over time depending on whatever the previous system looked like, so in theory the AI could arrive at a different uniquely interesting piece each time.\n\nSo can an AI compose music? Absolutely, and I disagree with the other replies that talk about the question as though AI could never be creative or that it couldn't understand music similarly to a human mind. Would AI music ever sound like human music? Probably not, in a lot of cases. I think if it was trained using data from existing musical works it could eventually pick up on what makes some music enjoyable. But if left to its own devices, I think it might create music that humans think is gross or boring. But therein lies the magic: The AI thinks it's interesting.\n\nSo would I ever use it in a score? Probably not, though it could be interesting, but I definitely see it being possible in the future.", "id": "dar45bk"}, {"comment": "Wow! Thanks for the long answer! Yeah, the possibilities are endless. Personally I think that the best combo is Human + A.I. scoring the music. Then you can get some interesting results!", "id": "darl0jb"}, {"comment": "No worries. AI is my field of study and a professor of mine who I've been able to spend some lab time with actually studies imagination and creativity in AI. The possibilities really are out there with what you can do.\n\nFor something like this, if you wanted to make music which would be interesting to a person I think the best bet would definitely be a human-trained AI, but I don't think the human would have to do much. I can imagine a system where the human asks a neural network to create a piece with a certain structure and using test data from pieces which sound similar, it goes and creates it. Then the human vets it for irregularities or even retrains it to not produce those irregularities, producing a score they like.", "id": "darm4j4"}]]], "5g7pd4": ["Cadillac -- Summersun [Progressive Indie Electronica] (2011)", "2016-12-03 06:43:28", 63, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YQTlR4zd88", [[3, "Great fuckin find, thank you!"]], [[{"comment": "Great fuckin find, thank you!", "id": "daqco39"}]]], "5g1al0": ["Polyenso - Dog Radio [Experimental Rock]", "2016-12-02 07:17:15", 9, "https://youtu.be/IHkHis0x4vI", [[1, "**Polyenso**  \n [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/ac31655158ec4f949d11665c9ab42ea8.png)  \n\n> Launched in 2012, Ployenso is an indie rock band from St. Petersburg, Florida, years in the making.

They called your sister the next day and even winked at your dad as the screen door closed.\n\n> Sour Bridges is Austin, TX\u2019s premiere browngrass band. It's like bluegrass, just a lil dirtier.  In spring of early 2009 they all got together and made music into magic. Comprised of artists from every different corner of the country, Sour Bridges\u2019 sound is an infectious combination of Texas folk, Appalachian bluegrass, and old-time rock and roll. The five members of Sour Bridges bring a wide variety of character and instrumentation to the table with the harmonious blend of fiddle, banjo, mandolin, lovin\u2019 and acoustic guitar.\n\n> In 2010, Sour Bridges released their colorful debut full length LP, Workin\u2019 on Leavin\u2019. Since then the band has been busy making \u201cSour Bridges\u201d a staple in the Austin and Hill Country music scenes by playing one dance-filled show after another. In May of 2013, Sour Bridges will release their sophomore LP, Catfish Charlie.\n\n> Their fun and lovable reputation landed them the opening slot at UTOPiAfest in 2012.

Paying homage to her hip hop godmothers MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, and Lauryn Hill, this Snow Hill, North Carolina native represents much more than just the female side of hip hop culture; she is an emcee who represents hip hop culture beyond the lines of gender, proving that anything the boys can do, she can do, too, and better. Her virtuosity and dexterity behind the microphone highlight her presentation, and her humble demeanor attests to her constant pursuit of improvement with every beat and rhyme.\n\n> After proving her impeccable craftsmanship with features on 9th Wonder's \"Dream Merchant 2,\" Skyzoo's DJ-Drama hosted \"The Power of Words,\" and numerous Kooley High releases, Rapsody made her solo debut on December 7, 2010 with \"Return of the B-Girl,\" a 20-track project boasting production by 9th Wonder and DJ Premier among others, as well as features from Big Daddy Kane, Mac Miller, Skyzoo, Rah Digga, Phil Ade, and more.

She has captivated audiences at sold-out performances at dozens of venues on The Incredibly Dope Tour with Mac Miller and the Mic Fest Tour with 9th Wonder and her Jamla Records label mates. In her sophomore project \"Thank H.E.R.

This seven-headed entity was given birth by Thomas Corpse and Thomas Fiend in 2010, its purpose being to translate their explorations of the magical realms into sonic transmissions we usually call long plays.\n\n> With the vocal talent Jess as their front woman and three guitars in the lineup, JATAO draws inspiration from pretty much everything that lies within the musical fields and beyond. Imagination is never to be censored when writing music, and one could say that's the lifeblood of all art.\n\n> Starting out with a strong NWOBHM influence, as heard on their self-titled debut back in 2012, the band has slowly grown towards their own true identity. Nowadays one can find traces of surf, blues, folk, jazz, rock, and loads more in their exciting and smoky sound. The \"Astral Sabbat\" EP and the \"Castaneda\" 10-inch are fine examples of their current state of being.\n\n> Often mentioned as a part of the occult rock movement, the group is unwilling to force themselves within any particular genre. They believe that diversity is one of the keys that will keep the stones forever rolling so there is no need to be locked within a small room with no view.\n\n> In 2014, King Diamond summoned JATAO to be the warm-up act for his North American tour, which consisted of 17 shows.

This seven-headed entity was given birth by Thomas Corpse and Thomas Fiend in 2010, its purpose being to translate their explorations of the magical realms into sonic transmissions we usually call long plays.\n\n> With the vocal talent Jess as their front woman and three guitars in the lineup, JATAO draws inspiration from pretty much everything that lies within the musical fields and beyond. Imagination is never to be censored when writing music, and one could say that's the lifeblood of all art.\n\n> Starting out with a strong NWOBHM influence, as heard on their self-titled debut back in 2012, the band has slowly grown towards their own true identity. Nowadays one can find traces of surf, blues, folk, jazz, rock, and loads more in their exciting and smoky sound. The \"Astral Sabbat\" EP and the \"Castaneda\" 10-inch are fine examples of their current state of being.\n\n> Often mentioned as a part of the occult rock movement, the group is unwilling to force themselves within any particular genre. They believe that diversity is one of the keys that will keep the stones forever rolling so there is no need to be locked within a small room with no view.\n\n> In 2014, King Diamond summoned JATAO to be the warm-up act for his North American tour, which consisted of 17 shows. It was the first long tour for the band, and it really turned the volume of their live performances towards newly found heights. Today you can see a confident band on stage, who really enjoy performing their art for all to see.\n\n> Their lyrical concept is based upon the personal trips and out of this world experiences of the writers.

But only a portion of their car time is dedicated to their touring schedule \u2014 the rest is something like driving in the middle of the night from Nashville to Alabama and back, just to listen to a new record 12 consecutive times. Despite their wagon\u2019s sketchy brakes, this happens a lot. It\u2019s where the indie-roots band discovered a shared love for the timelessness of Motown records, the weight of Springsteen\u2019s Nebraska, the textures of modern rock bands, as well as the intensity of really skilled acoustic players.\n\n> It\u2019s also where they cemented their bond, spontaneously forming the band after just one gig at Belmont University in Nashville, TN. Now, just over two years later, The Apache Relay is releasing their second album, American Nomad, a modern and young roots-rock collection produced by Nielson Hubbard. Their debut 1988, was released in 2009, produced by Doug Williams best known for his authentically raw approach with the Avett Brothers. The record cracked the door to reveal the band\u2019s capabilities, and Paste Magazine named it an \u201cAuspicious Debut\u201d and highlighted the band as \u201cBest of What\u2019s Next.\u201d\n\n> Since then, they\u2019ve continued solid and non-stop touring, securing a fervent fanbase for their jumping-up-and-down energetic shows. \u201cPower Hungry Animals\u201d is one song culled from that energy and growth as musicians. \u201cThe lyrics are a bit harsh in that it\u2019s a response to my first trials with music industry politics and coming to terms with the idea that control is just an illusion,\u201d says Michael Ford Jr. \u201cBut there is an element of freedom and joy in that awareness and the music reflects that.\u201d\n\n> Indeed, the song\u2019s refrain \u201csouls cannot be fooled,\u201d is driven at first by separate layers, then swelling together into a flood of sound with Kellen Wenrich\u2019s fiddle almost indistinguishable from Mike Harris\u2019 (insert electric guitar name here) and Brett Moore\u2019s keys. It\u2019s the essence of Apache Relay\u2019s own wall of sound \u2014 culled from different instruments, voices and approaches.\n\n> Ford Jr. found his bandmates by chance in a dorm in Nashville, where he was becoming known for his songwriting. His first introduction was to guitarist Mike Harris, who circumvented the music school\u2019s practice hour rules pretty much any time he wanted. Harris would roll his amp into Ford Jr.\u2019s room to jam on Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn tunes into the night. Later, when Ford Jr. started disliking performing his songs alone, he heard about Harris\u2019 new band, The Apache Relay (named for the underdog race in Ben Stiller\u2019s Heavyweights). And though Ford Jr. had never heard or met the trio with Moore and Wenrich \u2014 he hired them to back him at a show, and all four musicians knew they had started something special.\n\n> There was something about the talent and chemistry that everyone brought to the table that just worked right off the bat. Mixed in is a Bad Brains bumper sticker, a bit of Suzuki training, jazz lessons, a lot of Beatles listening, knowledge of traditional mountain music, a worship of Phil Spector and the love for the complex but accessible layers of bands like the Arcade Fire.\n\n> As a lyricist, Michael Ford Jr. has an unvarnished way of presenting the joy of infatuation or the sadness of loss. It\u2019s youthful in a way, in that it grasps of deeper emotions before time starts making them more complex and overwrought. But the songs are transformed by his bandmates, as with the title track, a pop-influenced melding of the electric and acoustic into an infectious momentum. \u201cThe song was originally written as ballad, but when I played it for the guys and they gave it a new life by speeding up the tempo and it quickly became the backbone and a favorite at our shows.\u201d\n\n> \u201cHome Is Not Places\u201d is another highlight and perhaps a companion song, brimming over with space-filling sounds, tempo changes and a robust chorus of 15 friends in the studio. \u201cIt\u2019s a song that that battles the feelings of isolation and homesickness while touring. It\u2019s the idea home can be found in a community not a physical place.\u201d\nThe one song he didn\u2019t pen for American Nomad is Springsteen\u2019s \u201cState Trooper,\u201d a song that became a linchpin for the band. \u201cWe all were influenced by Nebraska, and we played the song out of necessity in the very beginning because we didn\u2019t have enough material to fill the set,\u201d says Ford Jr.\n\n> The indie stalwart Thirty Tigers will release American Nomad nationally on April 12th, 2011. The Apache Relay will extensively tour in support of the album, playing festivals and clubs across the country with planned stops at SXSW and more.

But only a portion of their car time is dedicated to their touring schedule \u2014 the rest is something like driving in the middle of the night from Nashville to Alabama and back, just to listen to a new record 12 consecutive times. Despite their wagon\u2019s sketchy brakes, this happens a lot. It\u2019s where the indie-roots band discovered a shared love for the timelessness of Motown records, the weight of Springsteen\u2019s Nebraska, the textures of modern rock bands, as well as the intensity of really skilled acoustic players.\n\n> It\u2019s also where they cemented their bond, spontaneously forming the band after just one gig at Belmont University in Nashville, TN.

Its two members, Haruka (Halca) and Yukari (Yucali) also comprise the group's name; a concatenation of \"Haru\" and \"kari\". Haruka, born April 21, 1988 and Yukari, born July 18, 1987 originally met as finalists at a hip-hop audition held in a local school in the Meguro district, where both were born. \n\n> At their inception, the girls were produced by Oshare Track Factory (OTF) comprised of producing artists Rip Slyme, Ryo-Z and DJ Fumiya and signed to Tokyo-based record label, For-Life Music Entertainment (FLME).\n\n> Released in 2003, their debut single, \u30bf\u30f3\u30c7\u30e0 (Tandem) and accompanying music video paid \"double homage\" to the RIP SLYME song \u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\u30ba\u30fb\u30c7\u30a3\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8 (Steppers Delight) which originally parodied the song Rapper's Delight by American artists The Sugar Hill Gang as well as various video game and pop-culture references, including the Super Mario Bros. and \u5b87\u591a\u7530\u30d2\u30ab\u30eb (Utada Hikaru).

She\u2019s a joy for any listener to discover\u2014a lover and a fighter and old-soul trader in genuine energy, aiming straight for the heart. Prass turns a sly eye to the pageantry of emotion, the drama of love and the mysteries of everyday life with a disarming mixture of sincerity and cosmic insolence, unapologetically romantic, spinning golden threads of lyric and melody, each inflection and melisma planned and considered, each word tailored for meaning and effect\u2014the pop gesture as artform. She delivers it all with carefree charm and nearly divine intuition.\n\n> Born in Cleveland, in the heart of the 1980s, Prass entered the teenage slipstream back on the east coast, past the haunted houses, surf shops, and burger joints of Virginia Beach, a mid-tier, rough-around-the-edges resort town. There is an inevitability to every biography, a myriad of strange narrative palm lines that twist and intersect, and she followed hers bravely to a seam of alternative beach culture, living close to the Atlantic Ocean but studying a less bronzed way of life. With her pet bird on her shoulder, she took intensive music and visual art courses all through high school. Going to a good music school was the next logical step, but after a year in cold, snowy Boston, Prass dropped out of Berklee and returned to the beach.

She\u2019s a joy for any listener to discover\u2014a lover and a fighter and old-soul trader in genuine energy, aiming straight for the heart. Prass turns a sly eye to the pageantry of emotion, the drama of love and the mysteries of everyday life with a disarming mixture of sincerity and cosmic insolence, unapologetically romantic, spinning golden threads of lyric and melody, each inflection and melisma planned and considered, each word tailored for meaning and effect\u2014the pop gesture as artform. She delivers it all with carefree charm and nearly divine intuition.\n\n> Born in Cleveland, in the heart of the 1980s, Prass entered the teenage slipstream back on the east coast, past the haunted houses, surf shops, and burger joints of Virginia Beach, a mid-tier, rough-around-the-edges resort town. There is an inevitability to every biography, a myriad of strange narrative palm lines that twist and intersect, and she followed hers bravely to a seam of alternative beach culture, living close to the Atlantic Ocean but studying a less bronzed way of life. With her pet bird on her shoulder, she took intensive music and visual art courses all through high school. Going to a good music school was the next logical step, but after a year in cold, snowy Boston, Prass dropped out of Berklee and returned to the beach. She spent a spell working and playing shows in boardwalk clubs before moving out to Nashville where she has spent close to the last decade developing her craft, collaborating with some of the better characters on the edges of Music City culture, building a reputation with her radiant voice, unique performances, and for being a bit of an iconoclast.
