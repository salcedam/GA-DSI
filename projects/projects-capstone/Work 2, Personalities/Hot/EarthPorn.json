Plenty of great hikes in Waimea Canyon and it's easily one of the best place for photography on the Island.  Bit chillier up there so dress a bit warmer than you'd expect for Kauai.  The soil there is quite dry so even if it does rain for an hour or so it won't make the trails over there muddy the way they are in other spots on the island.  Up in the Canyon weather changes very quickly.  If you get to a nice spot for photography and weather seems off, just wait about a half hour and weather will likely change and open up.

Also across the road Waimea canyon hike to the top of the falls, and down in poipu is a great coastal hike I forget what it's called but it's near that cave and tortoise farm. And of course kalalau trail\n\nBest thing I can reccomend for hiking in Kauai and no one ever takes my advice but you should, is buy a set of Kahoola microspikes. It's a tiny price to pay given how much this trip is likely costing you. The trail is often wet and often slippery and steep. I was jogging past people sliding down parts of the trail on their bums. I was able to walk the goat path knife edges with ease. ", "id": "dap19ve"}, {"comment": "Your advice has been the most helpful so far so I will 100% take your word for it. I have already purchased a set of those exact spikes because I will be doing some hikes on the Big Island which look beyond slippery.

I'd like to do some star gazing too.", "id": "dapb95r"}, {"comment": "If you have those spikes, and ideally trekking poles, and have some hiking experience I would recommend linking Awawapuhi with Nualolo via the cliff trail. Cliff trail is closed because about 30 feet washed out and the trail is now off camber and slippery, but with microspikes and trekking poles there's no issue. Worst case you don't like it you just turn around and skip Nualolo point. Awawapuhi is better but it's a great loop of you can do it. The rest of the cliff trail is flat and overgrown, poses no challenge.\n\nI didn't do any late day hikes, the weather was by far the biggest challenge when I went in May, it was often cloudy. Kalepa and kalalau lookout are the worst for being socked in, as you move down the ridge things stay clearer longer, for stargazing I'd say Nualolo offers your best chance because it's the lowest elevation, and the trail back in the dark would be no problem. \n\nJust FYI Honopu trail is a little tricky to find, there's a web of little trails in the woods and it took me some time to find the actual trail, when you find it, it will be obvious. Wear long sleeves and long pants because it's overgrown and otherwise you will get scratched to death. I mean it. \n\n", "id": "dapbsoo"}, {"comment": "Wow thanks for so much info here!

I've also noticed that most visitors will go just to check out Machu Picchu, Cusco, and maybe Ollantaytambo. Cusco is a beautiful city with a lot to offer but the rest of the country is also wonderful! \n\nThe coastline has a lot of really cool archaeological sites with really impressive monumental architecture that still survives. If you're in Lima, about 45 minutes away is Pachacamac, an oracle site that existed for a few thousand years before the Inca conquered them and built a huge mound dedicated to the sun. It overlooks the ocean and the views are insane. On the north, outside Trujillo, there are the Huacas de Moche, also known as Huaca del Sol and Huaca de la Luna, more huge pyramids, and these ones have preserved murals on the sides that were painted some time before 900 AD and entire complexes on the tops. There's another site, a bit inland, called Chan Chan. It was built by the successors to the Moche, the Chimu, and is 9(?) huge citadels with really complex layouts, artificial lakes, and other cool stuff. \n\nIn the highlands my favorite site is Chavin de Huantar. It's about 3000 years old and was an oracle/pilgrimage site. The inner temple is full of labyrinths, which were basically intended to disorient visitors after they had imbibed hallucinogenic cactus and before they visited the lanzon, the Oracle of the site, a big carved obelisk made from a single stone. It's also in the middle of a valley and has beautiful views all around. It's tough to get to, you have to drive about 3 hours from Huaraz, but it's so very worth it. \n\nI also finally made it to Arequipa the last time I was there. It's a city in the highlands, in the shadow of a volcano. It's full of majestic churches carved from white volcanic stone (which is why they call it La Ciudad Blanca) and its chock full of really cool things to see while also being a good hub for visiting the Colca Valley and seeing condors.

I don't recommend hiking the trail. It's a nice workout, but not a nice hike. You could definitely spend your time better.  I'd just do the gondola if your goal is sight-seeing. If you hiked up Tunnel Mountain instead before or after the gondola ride, that would probably be more enjoyable.  \n\nBut don't take advice from anyone who isn't thinking about the fact that it's May, and therefore winter.  \n\nSince you're staying in Canmore, if you want to hike, try hiking in the east end of the Bow Valley instead, where you're more likely to find safe, snow-free conditions.

What makes a hike worthwhile for you?  \n\nOptions are significantly more limited in May, so some more idea will help me give you something more helpful.  \n\nYeah, a lot of people come to visit thinking May will be a lovely lower-cost, lower-busy spring, but don't realize that at 51N and 1800m, May is solidly winter.
