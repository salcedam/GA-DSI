I know too much about these. They are much more efficient than any other irrigation method for several reasons. The center pivot eliminates the need for machinery and resources (tractor, labor, time) to move a sprinkler row. Instead, there are electric motors on each wheel which rotate the sprinkler around its pivot. These move at intervals of about 5 seconds on, 30 seconds off, and move (on the outside of the circle, of which the radius can be up to around a quarter mile) at about 1-2 mph. Very slow, but they are constantly rotating so there is even coverage over the whole field. The other major advantage is that the sprinkler heads are hung from the bottom of the main truss section and have a finer, more even mist. This reduces water waste to evaporation and you also don't have to waste energy throwing it upwards in the air to let it fall down again.\n\n-[/u/Mplus2](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2g9glo/farms_in_saudi_arabia/ckgzyyl/)", "id": "daq08yc"}]]], "5gbzf8": ["This guy puts his fridge on his back and bikes away", "2016-12-04 00:54:51", 94, "https://i.imgur.com/GvitlRx.gifv", [[20, "What the *fuck*?"], [13, "I've never been more amazed by anything in my life."], [8, "And it was all in vain, because that compressor isn't going to work very well after having been on its side like that."], [5, "That looks unsafe."], [4, "I'm not sure what is more amazing: the fact that he thought this would work, or the fact that it did."], [5, "What happened at the bottom of that hill is what I want to know.

The state record Brown Trout, the size of an Atlantic Salmon, came out of East Lake.  Both lakes are stocked with rainbow trout that over winter well, near the hot springs.  There are places on the sandy shore where you can dig out a hole and make your own geothermal hot tub.  Drive to the top of Paulina Peak to get a complete view of the two lakes, the cinder cone that separates them, and the three obsidian flows.

I've been on so many jobs and newbie welders who have a grasp of how to do basic mig or flux core welds do so so work but never really understand the basics. \n\n\nI was started off with oxy/acetylene gas welding and it was a bitch. I finally got it down and learned it's limitations and how to do it fair enough to fix my Grandpa's muffler for his tractor. It had rusted out on the end and broken away partially.  I saw it as a sort of experience I needed. Basically stole it off his tractor at the shop, loaded it up in my vehicle and headed off for weld school in Long Beach. Actually used a carbon arc gouger to clean it up a bit and take off the thin metal and then used the gas torch to weld it back to original condition. Found out how the suckers are made in the process. Got it back on his tractor in mint condition next week with him not even knowing it had been repaired until much later. So gas welding is also a cool place to start. \n\n\n\nBut you are right. Stick welding teaches some basic skills and is slow enough that a learner can see how it is actually working. \n\n\n\nAnd you are so right about people that start off with flux core (I'm talking FCAW or gas with a flux core here) or mig and have no basic understanding. They will never understand the process with out someone there to explain it to them and it's so easy for them to just imagine they are doing it right but don't know what they are doing and looking at. \n\n\nI worked in a shop where I was on the end of an assembly line and  a bunch of parts came down the line and when I assembled and welded them I was required to do a very quick inspection lasting maybe five or ten seconds where I would give a good rap on certain parts just to be sure. No biggy. Just give a rap here and there and listen to the right sounds. Rings true? Do my part and shove it down the line. \n\n\n\nSuddenly after months of never having an issue a bunch of units come down the line and when I do my little test, parts are falling off. The same part. The same weld. The same side of each weld. All fell off. \n\n\n\n The welds were text book perfect except for that one edge that showed a small signal of lack of fusion. I knew who did it and went to watch him. He had his heat just a bit too low and his wire just a bit too high. He was aiming his stick out wire just a bit too far to one side every time. I stood behind him and secretly watched through my own weld hood. \n\n\n\nThen I major messed with his head. I asked him, \"What the ell are you doing?\". He was a kid. A rookie. He was confused and a bit nervous. \"I'm welding these parts on.\". Still confused and now worried. \"No you're not. There's no welding going on here at all\". Took him back to my booth and showed him what I found. Took him back to his booth, grabbed his hammer and hit each completed part that were stacked up. Went down the stack hitting the added part. Those nice picture perfect welds all snapped off with ONE HIT!!!. He was shocked and I started laughing my ass off before I showed him what he was doing wrong. And that's why you are so right.

This takes a large voltage since you're literally splitting the N2/O2 molecules. This path of ionized air has little to no resistance\n\nOnce one of these arcs find ground, and current is formed and electrons begin to travel. Because of the lack of resistance in this ionized path, a lot of current flows. ( Voltage = Current x Resistance). This heats up the air lowering its resistance even more ( dielectrics (insulators) get more conductive with heat, conductors lose conductivity with heat). This provides near short circuit conditions( resistance -> 0 )\n\nAs you can tell those bright fast arcs are those locations with short circuit conditions.

If you spin the cable at less than escape velocity, though, it will come down... somewhere. It's impossible for a broken cable to reach a stable Earth orbit, so it will eventually come down with several kilotons of force. At escape velocity, however, the only concern is whether by some freak occurrence there's a satellite in the way. \n\nFourth, the centrifugal force of the cable doesn't just have to support the cable's weight, but the weight of the sheath protecting it from the air, and the payload being set on top of it, so it has to support several times its own weight, which means the centripetal acceleration has to be several times gravity.

TIL", "id": "dam8r8s"}, {"comment": "Drones are different. I own a 40 dollar syma X5SC and it has a cheap little camera on it, but it's fun (flight time of 4-5 minutes and takes 2 hours to charge. Upset about that so I'm going to get a better battery and motors to carry it) so it's a good starter to learn basic controls. It even has a 3 axis stabilizer gyroscope so you won't crash easily. This is a good starter though as you can replace the batteries over and over with others (batteries aren't like AA Duracells. They're more like lithium ion phone batteries where you charge them and reuse them) and buy small upgrades for it. There isn't much to upgrade though as the motor housing is small. I cut away parts inside to make the battery housing bigger , so at the slight cost of ascension speed, I gained more flight time.\n\nMy higher drone is a parrot SWAT , headlights , also gyroscoped, no camera, but also has an emergency crash landing button and assisted recall (still learning to make it work. This one has your phone be the controller). You can deactivate the gyroscopes once you're ready for more advanced flight. Faster charging time , and uses a simple cable like our phones (micro USB) , and even indicates when it's done with colored lights. I suspect this to be ~$200 as I got this as a Christmas gift last year. Better than my syma, but worth it because I like drones. It's super fun but for someone who may not like drones, the cheaper alternative would be better. Maybe an RC store nearby has a few testing models (one in my mall does ) you can try. \n\nThe one this guy uses based on how far he went while having control, the camera quality , and assuming he has some good cash, it's going to be one of the $2,000+ plus models. I've never flown one of these big ones but there's RC and drone meetups in my city and some guys were showing off their models vs some younger teens homemade drones (I'll give it to the teens. No gyroscope but they programmed all the motors controls and such. And their drones are FAST.) , and they explained some stuff to me. Generally bigger is better as long as there's quality, but way too costly to start with if you're interested in just trying out.", "id": "dam9j0l"}, {"comment": "Great comment!\n\nThe one thing that I would add is that the teens who built their own drones probably have a flight controller with a gyroscope in it, but choose to fly in a mode that doesn't utilize auto-leveling.

Grooveshark is garbage.

Many of the tracks are unlabelled or mislabelled, of inferior sound quality, and at least one of the songs on this playlist doesn't exist on this site. (\"Dogs\" by the band \"Out of Phase only exists on Spotify). So go to Spotify instead if at all possible. Grooveshark is a bottom feeding leech, even by Spotify standards.\n\nSo if you actually care about supporting the artists even in a nominal matter, at the very least use a site which gives the tracks proper credit. If at all possible, import this playlist into whatever more legit website you *can* use in your country, and shoot me the link and I'll post it up.\n\n I feel gross even making this Grooveshark playlist, but I feel I had to since someone else went ahead and made one anyway, left out several tracks, put the rest of the tracks all the tracks the wrong order and put the wrong versions of some of the songs up there.

Now, for this sphere, it gets more complicated. A sphere isn't made up of a number of small circles, as it happens with a cube. In fact, a proper wireframe sphere can't properly exist, as it would result in a finite number of flat faces unless it was solid, so in 3d space, a 4d projection/shadow of a \"4d sphere\" would simply be a sphere, much like the shadow of a sphere is simply a circle, regardless of rotation. By reducing it to a general 3d polyhedron, though, the 4d representation is still just a number of rotating copies of the initial polyhedron warping inside of each other.

The following is an explination of how to visualize the fourth dimension as both time and a physical dimension at the same time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The first three dimension**\n\nLet's imagine a dot. There is no mass, no length, no size, just a point in a non-existant space. This is the 0th dimension - nothing. To find the 1st dimension, imagine placing another point ouside of the first one. Now copy that point infinitely in each direction, crossing both points. This is the 1st dimension: length. A line. For the second dimension, imagine placing another point, outside of this line. Take and copy our line infinitely in each direction, crossing this new point. We now have the 2nd dimension: width. A plane. For the 3rd, imagine placing another point ouside of our plane, then copy that plane infinitely in each direction, crossing the new point. We have the 3rd dimenion: height. An infinitely large cube. This is where we live, the 3rd dimension. This cube represents a still frame of our universe; a snapshot of where we live. With me so far?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Imagining the fourth dimension as time**\n\nNow to find the fourth dimension, hold the image of this infinitely large cube we made previously, and then place a point ouside it. Can you place it? Probably not. We have an infinitely large cube, and there's nowhere to place the fourth point. So what we do is; take the entire infinte cube, and shrink it down into a single point. This point represents a still frame of our entire universe. Copy this point infinitely many times in each direction, crossing that new point. This is our timeline. Every frame of the universe exists on this timeline. Each copy is slightly different than the previous. As three dimensional creatures, we travel along this line, each step being another slice of our universe. For two dimensional creatures, the third dimension is time. An infinte amount of . For four dimensional creatures, the fifth dimension is time. Remember how we copied the plane infinitely in each direction, when going from the second to the third dimension? Each of these planes would be slightly different than the previous, and two dimensional creatures would travel along this stack of planes, through the third dimension. Have I lost you yet? Don't worry, there are whole schools of thought devoted to explaining this stuff. A person could spend a lifetime thinking about it, and still not fully grasp it.\n\nI can continue explaining the next 6 dimensions if you're interested.

The way we evolved on our planet with everything (including the planet itself) trying to kill us, not to mention millennia of fighting amongst ourselves, made us into the perfect killers, able to withstand great hardship, and more aggressive. Our adrenal systems actually make us stronger when put under pressure, and the more you push us, the less likely we are to accept defeat, preferring to fight against all odds for glory or to prove a point, or for strange concepts such as \"revenge\". In fact we even take pleasure in competition and beating others (where other species of the galaxy prefer cooperation and live in harmony). The concept of killing your own species is completely anathema to every other species of the galaxy, but humans have been doing it for aeons.\n\nThe other species of the galaxy have been in a very long war when they discover humans, and they are somewhat disgusted by our nature, and also a little scared of our potential.
