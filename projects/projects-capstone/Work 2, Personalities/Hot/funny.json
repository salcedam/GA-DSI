One of the parts of each unit is art. So we get to the unit that includes this painting. We would each be assigned a painting or two to research and present. Usually we just pick from a list. This time, my teacher comes up to me and tells me that she wants me to do two particular paintings, this one and another that was also more daring, although, compared to this one was was forgettable. I remember going to do a google search for this painting. I get my results. My mouth is now agape. What did my teacher assign me? I quickly close my search results before anyone could see, I can't be THAT kid. So I walk over to her desk and ask her did she realize what she had assigned me. Why yes she did. You see I was a particularly mature teen and fairly sheltered. So, she knows I can share the painting quickly and concisely and will at all costs avoid questions so I can get this off the screen. It works. My presentation goes off flawlessly and in my speed, people forget to even ask questions to keep it up on the projector longer. I'm successful, although I will never forget the feeling of that google search. My first encounter with porn didn't shock me as much as that google search did.

That's actually pretty funny because you're not actually *that* far off. Hanging upside-down is a pretty well-studied evolutionary trait of birds. Pretty much like you said, when the mother bird first lays the egg, the eggs tend to lay upside-down or on its side at first. Not due to weight, but actually the physical shape of eggs themselves. However, during the incubation period as the hatchling matures and gains weight, the egg tends to shift upside-down. Since hatchlings have no perspective of vision yet, they assume during the incubation period that this is the correct form to occupy. Once they hatch and mature into baby chicks, most of them outgrow this trait. Some however do not, which is the case in this gif with this adult bird. This is why when chicks are born, sometimes the mother birds can be incredibly loud and vocal. They must make sure to communicate to the baby chicks and remind them that the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead.

The machines on the inside store better prizes, but are naturally more difficult to win. \n\nIn these stores, you can generally ask an attendant to \"reset\" the state of any given machine. They'll open it up and put all the prizes back to their original positions, and if you fail enough times they'll make it easy enough for you to win, especially if you're obviously a foreigner (they want you to bring back tales of how you won crane games, to potentially bring in more interest? idk)\n\nanyways, tl;dr this machine isn't \"rigged\" in the way you think it is ", "id": "daq4sc9"}, {"comment": "That's more than fair enough, thank you for explaining what I was unaware of.

[Example scissor machine](http://i.imgur.com/LkOQYrr.jpg) \n\nBut the main attraction is usually the big claw machines. These ones, you simply have to ditch the initial thought of \"use the claw to pick it up and drop it in the chute\", because the claw is simply not strong enough to work that way. The attendants will often place prizes right on the very very edge of the prize chute. The most typical way to \"win\" is to use the claw to either pull up the back of it to lever the prize in, or to use the claw itself to \"hit\" the prize into the hole. [Example picture](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WUf3tKqCvow/VJwKcnppazI/AAAAAAAAwNw/aPQ6Rq-GA9Q/s1600/IMG_2007.JPG)\n\nThe other popular machines look [more like this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_IQnWsrhbAM/VJwI6O9Mp1I/AAAAAAAAwM0/ZX9JDb2BdqM/s1600/IMG_2002.JPG), with a large variety of types. These are meant for you to strategically move the box to make them fall in. Naturally, you can't do that in a single try, and that's why many people fail and think the machines are rigged. It's simply a matter of the machine taking multiple (planned) tries to move the prize in the way that you're aiming for in order to win. If done properly, the amount paid should be less than the value of the prize itself (as the prizes can generally be found in hobby shops all around japan for a set price). \n\nThere are many blogs/posts online that talk about strategies to \"win\" in these games. Bottom line is that although some machines may be stacked against you (many many 3-claw machines), many are very possible to win, otherwise arcades would never be able to hold a profit.\n\nSome aforementioned blogs (short and generally a fun read) [Blog 1](http://www.thewackyduo.com/2015/01/wacky-tokyo-ufo-catcher-tips-and-tricks.html) [Blog 2](https://pseudomacro.wordpress.com/ufo-catchers-tricksters-of-the-japanese-arcade/)\n\n", "id": "daq5y40"}], [{"comment": "This simply demonstrates that these machines are indeed the spawn of the devil.", "id": "dapp7qp"}], [{"comment": "That game is rigged.", "id": "dapodmp"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "daqe3pk"}, {"comment": "That doesn't sound very pretty.", "id": "daqgry0"}], [{"comment": "To the people claiming these rubber bands are fake, I would have won a Final Fantasy tonberry lamp in Akihabara on my first try if it were not for these things.
