So you get the \"call me stupid again - I dare you\" sort of response.\n\nThe solution isn't the usual Democratic pandering like Hillary Clinton with a shotgun or Michael Dukakis in a tank. The solution is for the Democratic Party to return to being the party of union values and standing up for the little guy.

Depends on how long the patient is down before CPR, and then secondarily on how quick shocks and drugs show up.\n\nThis assumes you've got a shockable rhythm, though. Ventricular fibrillation (VF, heart jiggles randomly and doesn't move blood) and ventricular tachycardia (VT, heart pumps way too fast so nothing happens) respond well to shocks; most of the time someone who survives sudden cardiac collapse has one of these going on. Asystole (actual flatline) and pulseless electrical activity (not VF or VT, rhythmic, but no effective pumping) are a lot harder to fix. Prompt CPR still boosts survival rates a lot, though.\n\nThirdly, a lot of cardiac arrest is due to an underlying cause. Sure, 30 minutes of hard work, drugs, and electricity might get you back, but that's not going to fix the nail in your pericardium (protective sac around the heart).

Brilliant.  \n\nedit: \\*sigh* Let me try to explain my view.   \nI'm not a fan of data collection, because for many problems it plain doesn't do shit.\n\n\nPromoting this app is like promoting plastic surgery for children who were victims of car accidents.  \nThis is totally nice for the minority that needs facial reconstruction, but doesn't do anything for those who broke their legs or spines or came out with bruises. It does nothing to make cars or roads safer, it doesn't promote better driving skills for the adults.  \nWhat it does is make people feel warm and fuzzy inside because they're doing something.\n\nMy problem with this whole thing is that once again we're trying to solve problems with technology. What we need is not another app to feed the everhungry datacenters. We need better education. We need children to know what people can and cannot do. We need people who deal with children on a regular basis be educated about how to spot and respond to signs of danger for the child. We need people who are attracted to children be able to find a psychiatrist and get help without having to fear for their lives - even most professionals don't want to deal with pedos, and those who do don't feel confident in their education and ability. We need social systems where families that need help can get it, where people with mental problems aren't cast aside, and where people with addictions are treated as sick, not criminals.  \n\nWe need to stop talking about this issue as if the problem is kiddie porn and pedophile rings. It's not. Most children get abused by people they trust: relatives, teachers, priests, doctors. Most abusers aren't even pedophiles but use children because they're easier to fool, to frighten or to force into submission. And only a fraction of the abusers document their crimes.  \n\nNow traffickam might be a good thing for the fraction of the children that get abused in a hotel room by the fraction of the abusers that film their actions. But let's be real, it's a very small minority, and by focussing on helping those few visible cases we lose sight of the roots of the problem.  \n\nThese are hard problems for sure. It needs time and money and the will to change things for the better. Things like traffickam are well intentioned, but I believe they take away from what we need to do in order to stop abuse from happening in the first place."]], [[{"comment": "It's a brilliant app. I've done the rooms at my hotel that I work at.

It does nothing to make cars or roads safer, it doesn't promote better driving skills for the adults.  \nWhat it does is make people feel warm and fuzzy inside because they're doing something.\n\nMy problem with this whole thing is that once again we're trying to solve problems with technology. What we need is not another app to feed the everhungry datacenters. We need better education. We need children to know what people can and cannot do. We need people who deal with children on a regular basis be educated about how to spot and respond to signs of danger for the child. We need people who are attracted to children be able to find a psychiatrist and get help without having to fear for their lives - even most professionals don't want to deal with pedos, and those who do don't feel confident in their education and ability. We need social systems where families that need help can get it, where people with mental problems aren't cast aside, and where people with addictions are treated as sick, not criminals.  \n\nWe need to stop talking about this issue as if the problem is kiddie porn and pedophile rings. It's not. Most children get abused by people they trust: relatives, teachers, priests, doctors. Most abusers aren't even pedophiles but use children because they're easier to fool, to frighten or to force into submission. And only a fraction of the abusers document their crimes.  \n\nNow traffickam might be a good thing for the fraction of the children that get abused in a hotel room by the fraction of the abusers that film their actions. But let's be real, it's a very small minority, and by focussing on helping those few visible cases we lose sight of the roots of the problem.  \n\nThese are hard problems for sure. It needs time and money and the will to change things for the better.

They might negotiate the cost of an EpiPen for, say, $100 (hypothetically). The government will then pay that for people on Medicaid. \n\nPrivate health insurance works differently. If a private plan covers health insurance, they might go to a company and say, \"OK, give me a $500 negotiated rate,\" and then they turn to their consumers and say, \"With our insurance, the price is $500, and we cover 20% of it--or $100. You owe $400.\" Now the drug company turns to people without insurance and says, \"The normal price is $750.\" \n\nWhat happens then, is people who pay $400 for it say, \"Well, you shouldn't be so stupid as to not have insurance. If you had insurance, you'd only be paying $400 instead of $750!\" When, in reality, both people are grossly overpaying. Then, when people complain to the drug companies, they'll say, \"We have coupons available online, and a program where poor people can apply to get their EpiPens covered if they can't afford them.\" But, in reality, most people end up paying way too much.\n\nThat is why private health insurance doesn't do as good of a job as public insurance. They'll pass a lot of the cost off to the consumer. \n\n----------------\nFor people who don't live in America, that's why we get bills that say something like this:\n\nCost of emergency room visit for a head injury: $3,500\n\nNegotiated cost of emergency room visit with your insurance company: $1,250\n\nInsurance company pays: $250\n\nPatient is responsible for: $1,000\n\n", "id": "d6wdsxl"}, {"comment": "People wonder why some decide to join the Armed Forces (US).

You'll also learn the super useful words which often have multiple meanings and uses. Knowing them will help a lot with:\n\n**Reverse translations**.\nAlways reverse the translation and see if its still clear what the meaning was. Or at least in the same ball park.\n\n**Yeh, idioms and slang.**\nWhile Google appears to do well with a lot of idioms they are a mine field for awkward misunderstanding. Forget slang, even two people with the same mother language but from different areas get confused by slang.\n\n**Danger words. **\nThere are so many words that have more than one meaning in English or can be used as verbs. Once a co-worker got into a taxi and google translated blahblah building for the driver. The translation took the meaning of \"building\" to be \"construction\". Between the languages (using reverse translate) figure out the danger words that risk translating badly.\n\n**Negation and double negatives**\nLots of languages happily do double negatives, again Google has got a lot better at this but double check stuff with negation in it (especially Asian languages) because sometimes Google will turn a true into a false. \n\n**Break it down**\nAnother one for Asian languages. Because of the way the characters can be split up in the sentence sometimes Google will choose the wrong pairing which can make the translation totally bizarre. This happens when pairing used by google is more common than the one the author intended. \n\nAlso deleting a few characters or sentences can make things much more clear.\n\n**Keep it simplified.**\nReally keep to subject verb object as much as possible.  In fact when I first moved to China I studied \"simplified English\" and learned to speak it. Everywhere I go in the world, when people aren't good at English, then I revert to simplified English. This makes a big difference. It also keeps Google pretty accurate as well.\n\n**Lots of sentences**\nI usually stick to short sentences with a single idea. Long run on sentences with multiple conditions will screw up Google big time. If you need to use conditions or branches  (if, then. Because, therefore) try to put details on the conditions in the next sentence. \n\n**Time and places **\nBig to small always works best. 24 hour clock. Tomorrow at 21:30 is better than 21:30 tomorrow. Suburb, street, building not the normal: building, street, suburb. \n\nAnd dates just do YYYYMMDD, everyone gets this.\n\n**Adjectives and adverbs **\nIn some languages these can carry a different connotation even though the translation is accurate. No way to avoid these without knowing them I think. But like i said, study the target language for yourself a while, it makes a huge difference when using machine translation.\n\n**Spell and grammar checker**\nI used grammarly a lot to check bigger emails. It helped a lot in getting a clearer translation from Google.\n\n**Include both languages in your reply.**\nWhere possible put the source and target languages in the email and make it clear it's a machine translation. This covers you if Google says something rude on your behalf.\n\n**Don't just use google**\nEach language will have it's favorite translation and dictionary tool. Get those and use them side by side with google. Usually google comes out on top, especially for European languages. But having a second opinion will sometimes uncover weirdmess that could be better written. \n\nAlso the dictionary tool is handy to go word by word or character by character when the wheels really fall off and google's translation is just totally incomprehensible.\n\nForgive the formatting, mistakes and me seemingly not following my own rules.

But, if the result's meaning comes back *very* differently, then you may want to try phrasing it differently. \n\nWhile it won't always work, it is a very quick way to spot instances where the translator uses the wrong definition of a word (like ones that depend on the context of its usage)."], [5, "Avoid idioms at all costs. it'll make conversation dry, but easy because the meanings of many many idioms don't translate at all so it'll be taken literally by the reader.

You'll also learn the super useful words which often have multiple meanings and uses. Knowing them will help a lot with:\n\n**Reverse translations**.\nAlways reverse the translation and see if its still clear what the meaning was. Or at least in the same ball park.\n\n**Yeh, idioms and slang.**\nWhile Google appears to do well with a lot of idioms they are a mine field for awkward misunderstanding. Forget slang, even two people with the same mother language but from different areas get confused by slang.\n\n**Danger words. **\nThere are so many words that have more than one meaning in English or can be used as verbs. Once a co-worker got into a taxi and google translated blahblah building for the driver. The translation took the meaning of \"building\" to be \"construction\". Between the languages (using reverse translate) figure out the danger words that risk translating badly.\n\n**Negation and double negatives**\nLots of languages happily do double negatives, again Google has got a lot better at this but double check stuff with negation in it (especially Asian languages) because sometimes Google will turn a true into a false. \n\n**Break it down**\nAnother one for Asian languages. Because of the way the characters can be split up in the sentence sometimes Google will choose the wrong pairing which can make the translation totally bizarre. This happens when pairing used by google is more common than the one the author intended. \n\nAlso deleting a few characters or sentences can make things much more clear.\n\n**Keep it simplified.**\nReally keep to subject verb object as much as possible.  In fact when I first moved to China I studied \"simplified English\" and learned to speak it. Everywhere I go in the world, when people aren't good at English, then I revert to simplified English. This makes a big difference. It also keeps Google pretty accurate as well.\n\n**Lots of sentences**\nI usually stick to short sentences with a single idea. Long run on sentences with multiple conditions will screw up Google big time. If you need to use conditions or branches  (if, then. Because, therefore) try to put details on the conditions in the next sentence. \n\n**Time and places **\nBig to small always works best. 24 hour clock. Tomorrow at 21:30 is better than 21:30 tomorrow. Suburb, street, building not the normal: building, street, suburb. \n\nAnd dates just do YYYYMMDD, everyone gets this.\n\n**Adjectives and adverbs **\nIn some languages these can carry a different connotation even though the translation is accurate. No way to avoid these without knowing them I think. But like i said, study the target language for yourself a while, it makes a huge difference when using machine translation.\n\n**Spell and grammar checker**\nI used grammarly a lot to check bigger emails. It helped a lot in getting a clearer translation from Google.\n\n**Include both languages in your reply.**\nWhere possible put the source and target languages in the email and make it clear it's a machine translation. This covers you if Google says something rude on your behalf.\n\n**Don't just use google**\nEach language will have it's favorite translation and dictionary tool. Get those and use them side by side with google. Usually google comes out on top, especially for European languages. But having a second opinion will sometimes uncover weirdmess that could be better written. \n\nAlso the dictionary tool is handy to go word by word or character by character when the wheels really fall off and google's translation is just totally incomprehensible.\n\nForgive the formatting, mistakes and me seemingly not following my own rules.

It sounds rude to us to skip those pleasantries... but if the listener is aware of your lack of language skills, then they should be understanding.\n\nAnd when you're down to only using two or three words (when your natural inclination is to use eight), you can more easily cycle through synonyms if it turns out the key word you're thinking of (\"reservation\") is better expressed with a different word/translation (\"appointment\", \"booking\", etc). Translation software is bad at understanding context. So strip it down to words that make sense regardless of context. Hopefully that makes sense? \n\nAlso, we tend to put the adjective in front of the noun (\"red door\"). A lot of languages do the opposite (\"puerta roja\" in Spanish, for example). Software doesn't always catch this, especially when it's buried inside a sentence. So putting \"door red\" into the software may get your message a little bit closer to something that sounds natural to the receiver (which lets them focus on the other parts that made them say \"huh?\"). \n\nAnd truthfully, it's a matter of trail and error a lot. I've had a lot of funny moments where it takes maybe a minute before I hit on a word or two that the Japanese speaker gets and we both get excited, and move on to the next part that we're confused about.

I'll also double check on medical coverage options because people see it and say \"well obviously I want the doctors visit covered\" and not realize that their health insurance would have them covered. Those are usually the default and sometimes needed, but not always.\n\nThe basics are doable and most people do an OK job. I never see anyone botch it hard but there's almost always one or two little things that can be better tailored.\n\nOh, and plus a lot of companies might offer early shopper discounts or whatever and if people want a quote to get a rough idea they'll often put today's date as the effective date and lose out what can sometimes be a couple hundred dollars savings in premium because they just didn't know what discounts where on the table.", "id": "d6n4k8j"}, {"comment": "You have no idea what you are taking about. ", "id": "d6na5cl"}, {"comment": "Please tell me which points are wrong and what jurisdiction you are licensed in. Specifics change with state/national laws and details may not be conveyed perfectly over a few sentences on the internet.\n\nEdit:\n\nActually, I'll break it down: I never disagreed with the comment above mine. You can usually do a pretty good job discerning your coverage with an online self quote with a little bit or research. However, I still recommend talking to an agent for the discount reason I recommended. If a consumer was not in the know, and most are not, then they might miss out simply because of a lack of knowledge. Some companies do offer that type of discount, mine does and I have seen others. It does exist, so that's right. Your coverage you selected would be spot on, but there still may be things you're missing because you just aren't in the know.\n\nOnto the point about the uninsured/under-insured motorist. [Let's just define that term so we're on the same page. Here's something from Progressive, they're the first Google result for the topic and are pretty reputable](https://www.progressive.com/glossary/uninsured-underinsured-motorist/). Many people will often match their UIM protection to match their liability limits. Not for any particular reason, it just often works out that way. This often changes when you get into higher liability limits. For example, state minimum liability in my state is 25/50/25. Which means you get a 25k maximum of coverage paid to one person for bodily injury, a 50k aggregate limit (say 2 people in the car at 25k each. If you hit 3 people at 25k each you're 25k short) for bodily injury, and 25k for property damage such as the other car, a sign, when you hear about people driving through the front of a gas station, etc.   \n\nI often recommend 100/300/100 because it's very easy to rack up medical bills if you hit someone and it's very easy to do over 25k or even 50k worth of damage if you hit one new Mercedes, or hit one nicer car, another car gets involved, and one of them gets pushed into a sign/wall. Matching your UIM coverage on the bodily injury side to 100/300 is fine and actually good since it's just as easy for you to rack up medical bills if someone hits you. But the issue lies on the property damage side. Look back at the terms for the property damage side. It's the amount you will be covered if an uninsured/under-insured motorist hits your car.\n\nNow lets say you drive a 2010 Lexus LS 460, a pretty nice luxury sedan with little age on it, but not much. In excellent condition Kelly Blue Book is pricing it at a little less than 23k. But lets put it at 25k max to be thorough because of regional differences, a dealer might ask more than a private party, etc. Now, how much UIM property damage coverage do you need if an uninsured motorist hits and totals your car? 25k because it is impossible to do more damage than something is worth. Anything above 25k to repair and the car is totaled, written off as a complete loss, and you're given a check to go buy another one. Your car will never need 50k, let alone 100k if you matched the above limits, worth of coverage in this category because it is impossible for you do do 50k worth of damage to a 25k car. You are paying for coverage you will never ever be able to claim.\n\nSo I fail to see how that assessment was wrong. People will assume to match the limits because they're of similar category or the program/website will default them to match sometimes. It depends. An agent can help you properly evaluate your needs and make sure you are neither under or over-insured. Now like the comment I replied to said, **if** you do the research you can determine this for yourself. However the vast majority of people do not do the research or might not even be sure how to make sense of the information. It happens very often and is a common problem in today's mindset of immediate results via the internet.\n\nOnto medical: if you have good health insurance it will adequately pay for medical bills after an accident. However you need to evaluate your own health insurance and determine your needs. Hence why I say I always double check. I ask about their health insurance situation. If the medical pay is needed then we add it, but once again, most people do not know insurance laws and local jurisdictions may change (for example, \"no-fault\" states might get a little odd and if the accident is determined to be no fault then each drivers company will pay out as need be, 10k is a common amount) a few things. Yet another reason to forego the online quote and speak to an agent. And once again, the 'default' coverages for the company/site might throw on medical coverage to the tune of a thousand or two, and unless you've evaluated your circumstances well enough you might be hesitant to drop coverage that appears to pay for your medical bills.\n\nTalking to an agent will make sure you're adequately covered, you better understand your policy, and will likely save you time. And as you go on in life, acquire assets, have a family, needs change and agents can reevaluate your circumstances and introduce new policies and coverage as need be. \n\nThose two examples above are relevant to my jurisdiction ad are things that are often missed and can be better tailored to a fit a customer's needs.\n\nOh, and for kicks and giggles, an online quote might not even be accurate/validated depending on whether or not the company runs consumer reports (credit, etc.) and driving records beforehand. They're charged for them so many will wait until after the initial quote to get a baseline to see if they're competitive. Once again, your specifics may change, so talk to an agent licensed for your jurisdiction for the details. You may have to end up speaking with an agent anyway.\n\nMost people just do not know, may get a vague idea with online research (but state specifics change), or might not even be able to make heads or tails of it. Some people don't really get computers, some don't really get insurance. Not everyone knows everything, hence why agents are trained and licensed to help you.

The two most important/valuable 'upgrades' (so to speak) by doing so are these (imo):\n\n1)  There is no deductible for a claim on the ring; and, \n2)  The item is now covered for 'mysterious disappearance'\n\nWhat the hell is 'mysterious disappearance'?  Well, for example, during breakfast one day, the missus suddenly notices her ring is gone, or the stone fell out, or something dreadful like that.  \n\nIf the ring were *not* scheduled, unless the ring was missing/damaged because of a named peril (e.g., theft, blew away in a tornado), she'd almost certainly be SoL and she'd get nothing and like it.  \n\nEven if it had been stolen, she'll still be obliged to pay the deductible on the policy (typically $500 or $1000) **and** chances are there's a built-in limit on jewelry (let's guess $3000 max) ... so, essentially, she'd be looking at getting a check of ~$2000 to \"replace\" her ring which, while not completely impossible, is going to be quite unlikely.  \n\nIf it were scheduled, it isn't bound to only the named perils on the list ... maybe she lost it while shopping, maybe it went down the drain while doing the dishes (how sexist), who knows ... it's a \"mystery\", thus 'mysterious disappearance'.  Whatever the case (minus fraud obviously), the company would, essentially, take care of replacing the ring with precisely the same kind (or at least as similar as is humanly possible), no muss, no fuss, no deductible, no problem more or less.\n\nNow, how often do people \"lose\" rings or stones?  Well, I don't know, but I don't imagine it's too terribly often ... just as it's really not terribly common to have a complete loss from your house burning down or dying specifically because of a car accident.  But it does happen, and insurance is there to protect you from catastrophe, and catastrophe can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes.  Some might suggest that $90 / year as insurance against the wife's peace of mind should that catastrophe strike is a pretty good deal; some might not.

The best column to look at is the \"$/mo avg\" column, because that shows you the all-in cost counting drive-off and monthly cost divided by the total number of months.  So a Spark EV comes out to $111.39/month, with that best deal.\n\n**But**, there are also state incentives which are not taken into account in that chart.  So in California, for example, you can get $2500 back from the state if you buy *or lease* an EV, as long as the lease is 36 months or longer.  So then, if you live in a state with an incentive like that, you can look at the \"$total\" column and subtract the amount of the state credit from it - which leaves you at $1,510 for the Spark EV over 36 months.  Divide that out, and your real lease cost is $42/mo.  Note that you do **not** get the federal tax incentive for leasing an EV - that incentive is taken by the lessor (the dealership), which is then rolled into the lower lease payments, which is why EV leases seem like such steals when compared to the purchase price of the car.\n\nThe CA rebate is subject to income restrictions, if you make over 250k or something then you don't get it, but if you make *under* 300% federal poverty line, which is like 35k, then you can actually get a $4k rebate from California - which means then that your lease cost on that Spark EV would be about 30 cents per month.\n\nThe deals change all the time, too.  A few weeks ago there was a Spark EV for $2,610 over 36 months, which comes out to about $3/mo after rebate.  I am sure there are additional taxes or whatever, and also you have to pay registration, insurance, and the cost of electricity to fuel it.  But compared to leasing any other vehicle, these numbers are going to be the same (tax, registration) or lower (electricity...and sometimes insurance, since companies are finding EV drivers are on average safer drivers so sometimes offer slightly cheaper insurance, plus they like to know that you're in a new well-maintained car rather than an unsafe jalopy) anyway.\n\nedit: also you should look at each dealership's website for any other restrictions, sometimes they have a \"lease conquest\" thing where the price they advertise is only available if you are currently leasing a competitive vehicle (Fiat does this), but the chart is a pretty good guideline for how cheap EV leases can be.", "id": "d7v3owf"}, {"comment": "This should be a YSK", "id": "d7v7d8z"}, {"comment": "Thanks.

By giving you material that a pathogenic virus or bacteria would have on it, such that your immune system can match what it saw from the vaccine with what the actual infection is and start attacking it right away. Your immune system maintains a memory of all infections it has seen before - this is why children often get sick a lot more than adults, as adults have a better developed memory in their immune system. These adults are infected all the time, but their immune system takes care of the infection before symptoms develop.\n\nSymptoms are a result of your body reacting to something.

If you get better, then it could've been from the antibiotic, or your body finally accepting the flu shot or getting rid of whatever it didn't like about it and the timing just panned out that way. But if the antibiotic doesn't help, then two things can have resulted: The flu shot is actually the cause, but it'd be weird to have symptoms lasting that long from it, or something else is going on. I suppose the rash would be your clue to differentiate between the two. If the rash goes away but you still have a migraine and episodic fever, then you have something else and it's a coincidence you got sick shortly after the flu shot.\n\nIf it turns out to be the flu shot, it would be nice to see if it's this particular brand that got you.

We were there later in the day so the tide was coming in, I played in the water while my aunt sat very far away on the sand.

As I swam closer to my friend I noticed he was struggling and in a panic. He was drowning. I had no idea what the right thing to do was so I grabbed him and told him to relax and swim with me back to the dock.

He likes science, he likes innovation, but he's not a big fan of controversy. He got very upset when James Randi (IIRC) took on another speaker that same year, arguing directly against what the other guy (a pop religious figure, I think -- it's been awhile) had to say. Anderson did not like that, and I believe that Randi left the event early.\n\nTEDx, conversely, is entirely dependent upon the personalities of the committees of people who organize the various events. Some of them are serious (I know the folks currently behind TEDx Redding in California are pretty sharp, e.g.), some of them are complete loons. The one at which I spoke had a strong committee leader who did all of the outreach and coordination with speakers, but ultimately everything had to go through whatever group of volunteers sat at the table that year.\n\nOf the five speakers at that event, two of them (me and a former inmate turned activist) could definitely have given our talks at a real TED. One was pretty superficial, and the other two had good topics but needed more experience speaking to large groups.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind about TED and, for what I've seen, TEDx is that the talk structures are fairly tightly controlled. The time limits are absolute -- at my year, I saw Chris Anderson get up and walk slowly towards a speaker who ran over her time, eventually standing right in front of her between her and the audience, not saying a word but just staring at her.\n\nHer talk was not included on the official DVD.\n\nIn general, giving in-speech citations is discouraged -- this is a general audience talk, not an academic lecture -- although having citations on slides can be okay. They *really* dislike slides with bullet points and/or abundant text. The preferred talk format is:\n\n* Here's an interesting conundrum (problem, situation, puzzle)\n* Here's a potential answer for this conundrum.\n* Here's why this matters.\n* Here are several surprising implications.\n* If relevant, here's what you can do yourself.\n\nThis style is not going to satisfy people looking for deep thoughts or strong opinions. A lot of nuance and complexity will go missing. Emotional or visually spectacular do better than subtlety. \n\nAlso, people don't always know this: speakers at TED or TEDx are *not* paid. I believe TED covers basic travel expenses for speakers, but nothing more than that. Conversely, at real TED the swag bags (given to all speakers and attendees) were awesome.

I put years into reading, looking up words that didn't understand, figuring out how to use a dictionary to learn pronunciation, striving to grasp  what may be the most important human ability (speech). it doesn't reflect poorly on someone who hasn't at all, and any assumption of being talked down to or feelings of inadequacy come from inside, not from the speech of others.\n\nthis reductionism of language is not good. but more than that, the idea that one is being a jackass by using a full and diverse vocabulary is more insulting than any perceived slight by using it.\n\nI could go on, but I think that covers the essence of what I meant well enough for you to think about and rebut if you so choose", "id": "d80esi6"}, {"comment": "Hey thanks for the thorough explanation!

First off, if you are an individual (not a business) then the IRS typically does not have your phone number! (unless it's about something ongoing that you have given it to them, but no personal tax forms request your phone number)  They will always contact you by postal mail.   If it is just information it's regular first class mail, if it's money owed or action to be taken it will be by Certified Mail.\n\nNow should they actually call you, then they always will immediately state their name and that they are calling from \"The Internal Revenue Service\"  (i've never had them say calling from IRS, later they may say something like The IRS reserves the right to..\")   They generally do not give you their first name.    For instance, \"Hello, this is Mrs. Jones from the Internal Revenue Service, I'm trying to reach Mr. Smith\"  - they will always ask for you by name and will almost always call you Mr./Ms.   It's a dead giveaway if some Indian guy calls and says  \"This is the IRS, and you must pay this right now...\"   (saying you  vs. your name)\n\nThe IRS is very professional, and the nicest people I have ever dealt with  (seriously)  when they call you (or in person) they are super polite and patient.   They would never start a phone call off threatening you or in a stern/threatening voice.  There would not be a ton of background noise of a call center behind them.     (now if you call an 800# IRS call center about generic questions, you might get a tired rep who isn't as polite or professional, but the people who call out are amazingly nice)\n\nThe IRS does NOT collect payment over the phone EVER.   They only accept payment via the EFTPS website or buy you mailing in a check or money order.   It will always go to a large city such as Philadelphia or Cincinnati.\n\nAny official mail from the IRS almost always includes a pamphlet about your rights and the appeals process.

You have not cited a holding based on Rule 403 that apologies, as a rule, have a prejudicial effect that substantially outweighs their prejudicial value. \n\nAs to the preponderance of the evidence standard, again, you do not understand. Exceptions exist in the rules of evidence that allow in hearsay if it is a recorded recollection, for example, or if it is a dying declaration. The party who wants to offer the hearsay must prove by SOME standard that the proferred hearsay falls into that exception. My recollection is that they must do so by making a preliminary showing that it is more than 50% likely that the hearsay falls within one of those exceptions.\n\nSo you can go fuck right off.\n\nEDIT: And my memory was correct, in most cases under Rule 104(a) preliminary questions as to the admissibility of evidence is decided by a preponderance of the evidence standard.

If you are in pain you need help, doesn't matter why. Yeah, maybe you're fat and you did it to yourself but even if you have started dieting that doesnt go away over night. Maybe they sprained their ankle really badly and are just using it while it heals. Or maybe they're dealing with psychological issues and have barely been getting by, let alone throwing in the responsibility of consistent diet and exercise. There is a mental investment involved and it is exhausting.\n\nThere are also those who are fat but have medical problems that are not the result of getting fat - I'm one of those people. I had a crooked spine as a kid that had to be fixed w/ rods and screws, I also have fibromyalgia. So I have suffered with chronic pain my whole life including mobility issues at times. I look totally normal on the outside but my body is so fucked up that I'm 2 arms, legs, and a head away from having a skeleton that looks like Wolverine's. No matter what I weigh I will still have chronic pain, period. If you looked at me and didn't know my story you would say yes I should suffer and give up a wheelchair. So I should suffer because I'm fat, even though I do the best I can through severe pain? Even though I went through gastric band surgery and lost 50 lbs already and am doing what I can to get thinner? But you wouldn't know that because it, too, is hidden.\n\nMy point is you don't know everyone's story so don't judge. Obesity is a complicated issue that involves mental and sometimes physical issues, 43% of obese people are clinically depressed. Maybe there are some lazy fuckers out there but I think far more people who use for a wheelchair legitimately need them than don't. I avoid using them as much as I possibly can because I've been given looks before at disney for using one and it's embarrassing and de-humanzing. Am I supposed to not live life and enjoy vacations because I have chronic pain and can't stand for hours at a time? Fuck that. \n\nThis idea that there are thousands of fat fucks out there, unnamed individuals, who's stories we don't know, using a wheel chair \"unfairly\" has ruined it for almost everyone who has a problem now. Now you can't safely (socially speaking) use a wheel chair without being 70, are lacking a leg, or have a cast, and even the cast is iffy. And that is so much more unfair than someone using their own money to pay for an expensive wheelchair rental at disney world. Trust me, they aren't free everywhere you go.

Some of those other companies generate their electricity from wind or solar power.

It used to be that you paid a little extra and specified that your sources should be renewable, if there wasn't enough renewable to meet the demand then the companies that supplied the grid would be forced to create sources like solar or wind. A decade ago that was at a premium - you'd pay a whole lot extra per kWh- but your dollars would be forcing those companies to create extra sources of renewable energy  rather than shovel a few extra heaps of coal into a factory to supply your house. nowadays enough companies have added enough renewables that when those companies factor in tax credits it's possible to save money. This is very location dependent based on tax credits and subject to change, clearly, based on recent election results. \nIt's an interesting concept that a lot of people, especially diehard environmentalists, didn't like because you're paying for cleaner energy somewhere but you're not necessarily getting it yourself. So if you live 2 blocks from a coal plant, all of the power to your house is coming from that plant, even though paying a premium for renewables. meanwhile your extra dollars are paying for someone 100 miles away to have power supplied completely by renewables even though those people may not care even a little bit that their energy is good for the world. Personally I don't care, I'm happy to make the world a little bit better somewhere, but a lot of people are only happy if their own little home bubble is the only place where their renewable money goes.  \nThere is a similar international argument, if you're a factory in the US and you want to buy energy you could pay $100 bucks an hour for regular coal power, but, as a US company, to change your factory over to renewable sources you'd probably have to pay $300/hr to install solar panels and inverters and change your whole set up. but if you wanted instead to  keep paying the status quo here for $100/h of coal power and pay $50/h extra to help a company in India, where the costs of installation are much lower start a company that is entirely solar powered. Your company is still totally powered by coal but for a smaller price you are perpetuating a system that is far more renewable and creating supply/demand for renewables. In the same way some people feel this is a cop-out since your own factory remains a coal consumer. \nTLDR: a little extra money from everyone for their power bill can encourage companies to finance renewable energy rather than reinforcing their non-renewable sources.

Around 2005, when the New York Times decided that it would sell ads for its online articles for something like 1/10th or less what it sold ads for in print, that precipitated a freefall in revenues for journalism and journalism hasn't recovered.\n\nA lot of people have said things like, \"Well, get with the times, print is dead, etc.,\" but the problem is [we still desperately need journalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq2_wSsDwkQ), and the money for the kinds of investigative journalism projects that drive changes to government and society has just been squirting out its artery for years now. The money website-based journalism makes off of ads--already cut off at the knees by the Times decision to value web ads so much lower than print--is cut even shorter by people using ad blockers to get content that's valuable to them but not valuable enough to endure ads. And it isn't just one site or another--it's industry-wide.\n\nSo whether you value Forbes or whatever, or you don't, if you value journalism, it's worth turning ad-blockers off on journalism sites. \n\nEDIT: ONLY on journalism sites.

We all want to read free articles from a wide variety of different publications. Putting up with ads from those publications we trust is, at this moment in time, how we can contribute as consumers of journalism to having journalism tomorrow.

However, sites that just bombard you with nonsense popups/malware are just not worth the risk. Which Download button is the real one? Let's click 10 of these, there's a chance 1 of them isn't malware!\n\nThe ad industry sort of did this to themselves. They abused themselves out of existence. Prior to Chrome/Firefox, remember running Internet Explorer? Every site would bombard you with 1000 popups. Chrome and Firefox eventually implemented it's own popup blocker. While that made browsing the internet more secure, ad companies only got more vicious in their attempts. The evolution of which eventually lead to software such as AdBlock Pro.\n\nIt doesn't help that some of the most trusted sites out there - have contributed to Malware intrusion. [In 2006 alone, Malware caused $13B in damage.](http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1225) Now that is alot, don't get me wrong. Imagine what it is now. Malware contributes to Ransomware. [Here's a Fox Business report from 2013 stating that Cyber Crimes topped $500B.](http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/07/22/report-cyber-crime-costs-global-economy-up-to-1-trillion-year.html) Of course Cyber Crime is everything. In that number, is a large amount of Ransomware/Malware contribution, without a doubt.\n\n\n\n> In 2012, it was estimated nearly 10 billion ad impressions were compromised by malvertising.\" Attackers have a very wide reach and are able to deliver these attacks easily through advertisement networks. Companies and websites have had difficulty diminishing the number of malvertising attacks, which \"suggests that this attack vector isn\u2019t likely to disappear soon.\"\n\n\n> In 2014 - there was a reported 325% increase in malware attacks, from the previous year.\n    \n> In 2015, Yahoo was the victim of it's own Malvertising. \n\nhttp://www.scmagazine.com/hackers-spread-malware-via-yahoo-ads/article/437075/\n\n> Furthermore, 2015 has seen attacks against, eBay, answers.com, talktalk.co.uk, wowhead.com and many others. It involved breaches of ad networks, including, DoubleClick and engage:BDR. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising\n\nBetween 2012 - 2016 the increase of malware has skyrocketed to around 1500%. Without an Adblocker in place, you're pretty much browsing the internet at your own risk (or, without a condom). \n\n----\n\nSo while Journalism is important in it's own right, the system evolved in part due to the blatant abuse on advertisers part. I'm not saying The Oregonian is responsible for this. It's a systematic error, that has in part been building up between advertisers and consumers for the better part of 2 decades (digital media).\n\n", "id": "d6sgqiq"}, {"comment": "Oh yeah-- I work in infosec journalism quite often!

Iost my job five months ago due to some legal stuff I have been dealing with. Unfortunately, my only expertise is in retail, owing to my general stubbornness and overall stupidity in my teens and early adulthood, but I have generally been very successful in that field, successfully running several stores for several highly regarded companies.\n\nThat said, I am having a large amount of trouble finding work right now (felony convictions are a bitch). My wife works, full time, and makes decent money, but in Maryland it's not quite enough to really live comfortably. Unfortunately she makes just a bit too much to qualify for any assistance whatsoever (she grosses 150 over the poverty line), which means i make too much to get any assistance either. \n\nOn top of that, for the past 3 years, until August, we were living with a friend rent free, just paying off bills and getting caught up financially. This means, obviously, that we own very little furniture (a dresser and a bed) and no kitchen equipment or food to speak of. \n\nIn August we were forced to leave his house due to his moving back home to be with his family. This left us with nothing and very little ways of coping. We were able to score a (relatively) cheap apartment for $725 a month (yes, that is cheap in our area, unless you move in to the ghetto, and neither of us is comfortable with that.), And that includes power and water, fortunately, but still we have nothing else. Our little apartment is completely empty outside of a bed. \n\nAll of our money is split. A little over half of what she makes goes to rent. About 300 a month or so to food, thus far, $150 to our phone bills and $200 to car and rental insurance, and the rest goes in to the gas tank of our one car to get her back and fourth to work. Somewhat ironically there is also $70 to a storage unit (mostly clothes and my TV) that I have to pay every month because I can't afford to rent a truck so I can empty it out, and I don't know anyone who is willing to loan me one. Each week when she gets paid we put aside $30 or $40 to buy something for the apartment (thus far kitchen stuff so I can cook and clean).\n\nI have been scouring for work since I lost my job, and especially since getting out of jail, applying to everything I possibly can, but thus far nothing. I can't do physical labor due to several injuries I have sustained over my life time, but I also don't qualify for disability because of them, though I am trying that route anyway. \n\nI know that if we keep trying we will work something out eventually, but I wish beyond hope that I could get some sort, any sort, of help. But again, we are stuck in a weird point where we don't qualify for anything but still don't make enough to live, and it is hard to see a way out of that....", "id": "d8euytw"}, {"comment": "Hey man, \n\nI can't comprehend what it would like to be you, having said that i'd like to try and help. First off the $70 storage fee seems to be the best place to start. A bit of googling led me to [this site](https://www.budgettruck.com/truck) You can get a van for $20 a day + 99c per mile. So in effect you can do 50 miles in it until it becomes more expensive than it is to rent out the place. However once it's done that's something you no longer have to pay.\n\nAlternatively, you mention it's just clothes and a tv, will the tv not fit into your wifes car at all? You don't have to do it all in one go and I know it will eat into the petrol a bit if you have to do loads of trips. But again that's $70 you save per month forever once it's clear.\n\nNext let's look at your food costs. I live in the UK and I don't know what the prices are like in Maryland, but everytime I've visited the US (Cincinatti, NYC, Atlanta, LA, Raleigh (NC)) I'm always taken aback by how cheap everything is compared to the UK, especially food. \n\n$300 seems excessive for 2 people, if you really take a close look at it are you sure you need to spend every dollar you currently are? Hell even if you cut $10 out that's $10 per month in your pocket which brings our total up to $80p/m saved.\n\nFor comparison my family in the UK (4 people) spends around \u00a3200p/m ($254) on groceries and from what i've seen in the places i've visited I estimate we could live comfortably on $200p/m. You can buy \u00a31 microwavable meals here (there must be an equivalent in the us). Live on those for a month and suddenly you have an extra $120 in your pocket (which more than covers the cost of that van rental from earlier).\n\nBack in Uni I lived on nothing but beans and noodles for 3 years. Mainly because I can't cook for shit, but also because tuition is super fucking expensive.\n\nThat phone bill is fucking huge, I know you guys get absolutely raped on phone bills compared to us so I'm not sure what can be done other than maybe a sim only service (which from what I can see after looking around on google should drop your bill by $40). But $150 is just outrageous to me. I pay the same for 3 mobiles (all 4g), 1 landline (unlimited calls 24/7) and 76mbps down 20mbps up internet for just under \u00a3100p/m ($127) (this includes the cost of 3 new handsets every 2 years).\n\nA quick look at T-mobiles website shows me that you can get unlimited talk texts and data for $50 a month. So thats a $50p/m saving if you get 2 lines.\n\nSo that's where i'd start. If you made all those changes tomorrow you would have $220 in your pocket extra each month.\n\n  ", "id": "d8ew3zm"}, {"comment": "The $300 a month for groceries thus far is excessive, but it is mainly due to the fact that we were starting from nothing.

Now that we have some stores (staples and cooking supplies are covered at the moment, and I have invested in cheaper bulk meats and frozen them to save money over the long term), I do believe that we can cut that down to about $200 a month, but given the overall costs I don't see it being cut down less than that, especially with her being pregnant.\n\nOn top of all that, I suffer from celiac disease, which cuts out a lot of the low cost options.

A good food pantry also will provide nutrition education and connect someone with other resources locally and govermentally to better address their food and nutrition insecurity . Also, food pantries are not usually trying to provide all the food a family or individual will need. The food is to increase the amount of food dollars available at the grocery store to \"stretch\" them. For example, meat is expensive in the store and many people may forgo this option for highly filling pasta, however, not only has the food pantry provided them with pasta to be able to buy that meat instead, but understand things to consider when buying meat, such as looking for sales, comparing unit prices, purchasing bulk (if possible now), and buying for health considerations like lower fat content and being able to prepare it in a healthier fashion. This is a comprehensive approach. This is also why food pantries provide tolitertries, cleaning supplies, clothes closets, and baby items, to free up other essential areas for money for food instead. Or why meals on wheels programs provide pet food to prevent food sharing with pets and creating more money for food items.

It's a bit tricky because a lot of manufacturers use their own proprietary names for the synthetic fibers they use, when they are simply variations on nylon, polyester, etc.  \"Polartec Fleece\" is PET - a type of polyester, for example.  \n\nFor outdoor cold weather activities, getting wet can be a huge problem.  And the \"wet\" can be from rain/snow, but it's also from your sweat when you're hiking/climbing/skiing/etc.  If your clothes trap that sweat, you can end up soaking wet without any precipitation.  No matter how good the \"shell\" is at being breathable, you're going to be somewhat sweaty, and thus somewhat damp.  Cotton is horrible for this.  Wool and silk (such as for long underwear) can be good.  Down is excellent insulation... when dry.  If it gets wet, it matts down and loses the air-holding capacity that makes it great insulation.\n\nSo because plastic fibers don't hold water and can be treated to be hydrophobic (repelling liquid water) they keep much more insulation ability when damp/wet, and dry out a lot faster than most (all?) \"natural\" fibers, particularly cotton.", "id": "dahce9g"}, {"comment": "They always recommend that women wear cotton underwear rather than nylon since it \"breathes\".

So, some libraries are part of a consortium, wherein they partner with libraries nearby (usually within the same county, but this varies) to share resources easily-- their catalogues are often connected digitally, so you can place holds and request materials yourself, and even return what you borrow at any library in the consortium. My library is part of a really big, county-wide consortium, but there are still one or two libraries who don't participate. This is completely at the discretion of the library's director and their board of trustees. That doesn't mean that they don't loan materials out, though. MOST libraries participate in an inter-library loan (ILL) program wherein they will actually send requested materials to patrons at other libraries, but it's often for a shorter time and likely without opportunity for renewal of the material. There are a bunch of ILL programs, but you actually have to have a librarian make the request for you. ILLs differ from a consortium in that materials shared within a consortium are able to be seen as available (or not), and ILLs are electronic requests made to multiple participating libraries, and THEY decide if they want to send the material out or pass the request onto the next library. It's hard to know where an ILL is coming from unless you're the librarian processing the request. Patrons can put their on materials on hold through consortial sharing, or even walk into an affiliated library and use their home library's card there. (Electronic resources are often exclusive to their libraries, though-- meaning, if I have a card at Library A, I can go to Library B and check out a book, DVD, CD, etc., but most likely cannot use their eBook database, or even some of their research databases.) \n\nSoooooo, to answer your question: Maybe!

The way portal redirections work is one of two ways:\n\n1. Redirection via DNS: You enter an address, and the hotspot gives you the IP of the captive portal. After you logged in, the DNS works normally again.\n2. Redirection via HTTP: You enter an address, and no matter what you entered, you get a 30x Redirect Response. The browser then follows this redirect to the captive portal. After you logged in, you will get the correct content rather than a redirect.\n\nOP's tip helps against type one portals. Because you normally cache DNS responses (i.e. the domain <-> IP mapping), it might take some time before the browser/OS realizes \"*maybe I should fetch this again just to be sure*\" and gets the portal.\n\n[HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) or HSTS was invented to \"prevent protocol downgrades\". Before, an attacker sitting between you and the website could just say \"*hey, no more https, plz send http*\" even after you connected, and the browser would then send everything unencrypted. HSTS fixes this by saying \"*Hi, nice to connect with you. By the way, I support SSL, and I will for at least X days in the future. So please only exchange encrypted content with me no matter what you hear!*\". So as long as the initial connection was secure, you will be safe. HSTS preloading simply means that browsers include a list of sites that should have SSL when you download the browser, making you even safer.\n\nNow, redirections via HTTP are a kind of man-in-the-middle attack. Think about it: What if you entered the website of your bank, and instead of redirecting to the captive portal, the hotspot provider would present you with a Phishing site? So the browser does the right thing and says \"*There's something phishy here, I will not connect to this site*\".

Because the attacker can create a bridge between the site, and your device, and use a fake HTTPS certificate that your device may blindly accept because it doesn't know any better.\n\nMeanwhile, if you visit a site on your mobile device within the safety of your home network, *prior* to accessing it on a public network, there is an aspect of HTTPS called HSTS that protects you from unexpected *changes* to an HTTPS certificate.

Think about a lake surface, when it's smooth, clear image, when it's windy and the surface is irregular, no clear image. The eye is like this, and if the surface isn't smooth, you don't see well. Tears keep the surface smooth, particular basal tear secretion. The act of blinking smooths the tears across the surface and helps to remove excess so that it doesn't roll down your face all day long.

I've held open the eyelids of many a friend, to help them get drops in. \n\n(On that note-- I'm also somewhat baffled at the number of people who seem incapable of using their fingers to hold their eyelids immobile.)\n\n*EDIT:* Wow... it's amazing how *angry* people seem to have become over such simple commentary.

And they do so involuntarily when something is getting dropped into them (as they should).", "id": "d678lbe"}, {"comment": "I'm not quite sure what I do that makes my process so different, but I'll try to explain it:\n\nI use my thumb and my index finger. Thumb for the lower eyelid, index finger for the upper one. I'm kind of using the *sides* of my fingers for this procedure. Make an \"OK\" sign with your fingers. Now raise the circle (thumb and index) part up toward your eye. This is more or less the finger shape I use. \n\nI press the sides of the pads of the aforementioned fingers into their respective eyelids. I try to place each finger as close to the eyelashes as possible. In other words, as close as possible to the point where the eyelids *meet*. So the inner edge (near the pads) of the fingers are right next to the eyelashes. \n\nThen with one motion, I simultaneously push the eyelids *in* and *open*. I'm not just applying pressure up (with the index) and down (with the thumb) but also applying a slight pressure toward the eyeball itself. At first the inward pressure is less than the up/down pressure, but when the eyelids clear the eyeball, I press inward harder.\n\nI continue this motion until the eyelids feel taut, and can't be pulled any further. In the final position, you should have a good bit of inward pressure (toward face / eyeball) as well as the up/down. In the final position, your fingers should be resting on the bone of the skull above and below your eye. (I can actually feel the bone through the skin when I do this.) \n\nAnd voila, my eyelids are now immobile. I'm exerting enough pressure with my fingers, where my eyelids will be unable to close involuntarily. Surely most people have stronger fingers than eyelids, no? Actually I just tested it, and even if I ***try*** to force my eyelid shut (using only the typical face muscles) I am unable to do so, with my fingers in this position. \n\nI'm sure it also helps that I've regularly been using eye drops for 20 years. So not only do I have the aforementioned technique down pat, but I no longer flinch when I put in the drops. IMHO it's just a matter of practice. I don't think I'm completely unique here.

Then where do jams come from?\n\nThe real problem is, traffic engineers for the last century have been blaming the jams on human behavior such as needless brake-tapping.  Yet they've been wrong from day one.  Since jams aren't caused by \"greed\" or \"human nature,\" traffic jams might actually be solvable.  But the experts can't do a thing until they admit their mistake and get over it.\n\nWhat causes jams then?   Jams arise for basically the same reason that a PA system will howl and squeal if the microphone is too close to the loudspeaker.   [Dense traffic is an amplifier,](http://trafficwaves.org/preventwaves.html) and jams are from the positive feedback: waves that grow from nothing.   Once the tiniest wave exists, the \"amplifier effect\" will enlarge it until traffic in one region is 2mph, and nearby it's empty road and 60mph.\n\nIn other words, the jams start out invisibly small, with waves that grow continuously.   Finally the waves grow so large that the drivers can no longer just ease off the gas a bit.  To avoid rear-end collisions, instead they have to actually tap the brakes.  Generations of traffic experts leap on this, \"AHA, human brake-tapping is what causes the wave!\"  Nope, the wave was already there before the first brakelight flashed red.  The same wave appears even if every car is computer-controlled, with no \"human nature\" involved.\n\nHow do we wipe out the waves?   Simple: by *wiping out the waves!*   Truckers learned this trick decades ago:  never be tempted to rush forward into empty space, and don't lose your large forward gap, even in heavy slow congestion.  And, whenever you come to a jam, wipe it out by slowly closing up your gap while refusing to brake.  (With a 1000-foot gap ahead of you, you won't be forced to hit the brakes for a looong time.)\n\n**tldr;** when you hit a dense wave on the highway, if you only have a 2sec gap ahead, you're forced to hit the brakes to avoid collision.  We CAN'T not-tap-the brakes.  The real trick to wiping out jams is to maintain a giant buffer:  100ft minimum, if everyone does it.  If only a few are keeping empty gaps, then they need to be much larger than 100ft.\n"], [2, "Pittsburgh has a downtown region that is pretty much exclusively accessible by tunnel or bridge (or joy of joys... both).

It doesn't benefit \"me before you\" behavior, it's out of our league. "], [1, "Here's an idea though. If keeping a large distance and avoiding unnecessary breaking really helps preventing traffic congestion or even reducing traffic jams, wouldn't it make sense for government to send \"congestion eraser\" cars on highways during peak times that would follow these guidelines?

Simple: by *wiping out the waves!*   Truckers learned this trick decades ago:  never be tempted to rush forward into empty space, and don't lose your large forward gap, even in heavy slow congestion.  And, whenever you come to a jam, wipe it out by slowly closing up your gap while refusing to brake.  (With a 1000-foot gap ahead of you, you won't be forced to hit the brakes for a looong time.)\n\n**tldr;** when you hit a dense wave on the highway, if you only have a 2sec gap ahead, you're forced to hit the brakes to avoid collision.  We CAN'T not-tap-the brakes.  The real trick to wiping out jams is to maintain a giant buffer:  100ft minimum, if everyone does it.  If only a few are keeping empty gaps, then they need to be much larger than 100ft.\n", "id": "da6s73q"}, {"comment": "Obviously OP is not suggesting to completely avoid hitting the brakes, even if that means crashing. The basic idea is the same as what you're saying: keep the large buffer so that you can cruise without crashing for a long time. But in addition to that, even when keeping a good distance, some people tap the brakes every time they see brake lights of the car in front of them, instead of checking if taking their foot from the gas pedal would be enough. OP is suggesting to not brake *when it's not necessary*.\n\nLooks like you mostly agree with that but somehow you make a conclusion that traffic jams are not caused by human behavior. How is not keeping enough distance not a human behavior?\n\nI think greed may be a factor too because some people are afraid that if they keep a large distance someone will pull in front of them and they consider that unfair or maybe mistakenly think that it'll make them arrive to their destination much later.", "id": "darqlgr"}], [{"comment": "Pittsburgh has a downtown region that is pretty much exclusively accessible by tunnel or bridge (or joy of joys... both).

There are still a lot of them out there though. What is important to realize is that for sellers launching new products on Amazon, these incentivized reviews were the primary way to get their product seen.\n\n If a seller listed a new product on Amazon and didn't do something to get some sales, their product will be lost in no man's land 20 pages deep and would literally never be seen by almost anyone. It is a catch 22 of selling on Amazon that you need to make sales in order to be visible, but you need to be visible in order to make sales. The primary way to gain visibility on a new product was to give away 25 or 50 units of a product to reviewers. This was not just for the reviews, but for the boost in sales rank so buyers might actually see your product. The problem was that people selling competitive products would just continually give away hundreds of units a month every month in order to out-rank their competitors. That's where you would see products with 2500 reviews and only 250 'verified' reviews. \n\nWhat is important to realize is that just because a product has incentivized reviews doesn't mean that it is a cheap,  low quality product or a knock off. It only means that it was launched on Amazon within the last 3 years or so. Almost all sellers used these review services to gain traction/social proof on new products. They practically had to in order to compete. \n\nIf you want to know if a seller was abusing the incentivized reviews on their products, Amazon has the option to filter for 'verified reviews' only. If a product has 500 reviews and when you filter the results it only has 100 reviews or less, they were abusing the system. If a product has 500 reviews and when you filter the results they still have ~450 I'd say they are probably pretty legit.

There are still a lot of them out there though. What is important to realize is that for sellers launching new products on Amazon, these incentivized reviews were the primary way to get their product seen.\n\n If a seller listed a new product on Amazon and didn't do something to get some sales, their product will be lost in no man's land 20 pages deep and would literally never be seen by almost anyone. It is a catch 22 of selling on Amazon that you need to make sales in order to be visible, but you need to be visible in order to make sales. The primary way to gain visibility on a new product was to give away 25 or 50 units of a product to reviewers. This was not just for the reviews, but for the boost in sales rank so buyers might actually see your product. The problem was that people selling competitive products would just continually give away hundreds of units a month every month in order to out-rank their competitors. That's where you would see products with 2500 reviews and only 250 'verified' reviews. \n\nWhat is important to realize is that just because a product has incentivized reviews doesn't mean that it is a cheap,  low quality product or a knock off. It only means that it was launched on Amazon within the last 3 years or so. Almost all sellers used these review services to gain traction/social proof on new products. They practically had to in order to compete. \n\nIf you want to know if a seller was abusing the incentivized reviews on their products, Amazon has the option to filter for 'verified reviews' only. If a product has 500 reviews and when you filter the results it only has 100 reviews or less, they were abusing the system. If a product has 500 reviews and when you filter the results they still have ~450 I'd say they are probably pretty legit.

Now if you put a item on sale you will still be paying Amazon as if you sold the item for the whole price.

So with the original price the earnings would be \u20ac9, and with the reduced price your earnings would be \u20ac8,10. Now, say you increased the price to \u20ac11, this would be the price on which Amazon is going be taking their part. So if you then put the item on sale for \u20ac10 your total earnings would be \u20ac8,90. \n\nNow, this is for  FBA in Amazon Germany, I don't know if this is how it works on all the other Amazon stores..

That is not true: organic farms can use pesticides so long as they are not synthetic. This is an arbitrary distinction, as many organic pesticides are significantly more toxic to humans or more harmful to the environment than synthetic alternatives. Toxicity to humans is mostly a concern for people living near farms or the applicators themselves because by USDA regulations pesticide residues on produce must be at least 100x lower than the lowest dose known to cause harm. Toxicity to the environment is a serious concern, especially for metal-based compounds (eg. copper sulphate) which can bioaccumulate, and synthetic pesticides are often designed with reduced environmental toxicity as a priority.\n\nThere are 25000+ approved pesticides by OMRI (Organic Material Review Institute) for use in the NOP (national organic program) run by the USDA. To point out a few harmful pesticides and try and say that organic pesticides are in general more harmful is naive at best. DDT is a classic example of \"conventional\" ag using a harmful pesticide. Most organic farms on a very large scale will be spraying in the same frequency as a large scale (monoculture) \"conventional\" farm. The difference is many small farms are organic and spray very infrequently, if at all. IPM should be your go to before just spraying.\n\n> Organic also means that the crops are not products of biotechnology (genetically engineered (GE) or \"GMOs\"). However, organic crops can be developed by randomly mutating the crop with methods such as radiation mutagenesis. These old methods are untested, the mutations are uncharacterized, and the crops are sold with zero regulations. An organic farmer could bombard hir seeds with radiation, grow the mutant crops, and sell them to you without a single biochemical test. Meanwhile, GE cultivars are produced over the course of years with careful analysis of the desired mutations, characterizing each change and assessing the effect on the plant - and that process is stringently regulated.\n\nNot one god damn organic farmer is out there radiating seeds for production purposes. I'm sure it's been done on a commercial level, but pretty much everything grown by organic farmers is just a verified organic version of what conventional farmers use. Sungold tomatoes, organic or not, are the same thing and are a hybrid cherry tomato species. Almost all productive crops, are hybrids because of the effects of hybrid vigor; same thing for cornish cross chickens for meat or leghorns for eggs, organic or not. You'll find this true across almost all sectors of agriculture that are attempting to maximize yields.\n\n> More important than the pesticides or the seed development technique used, though, are the direct ecological impacts of farming itself. Modern farming methods are able to mitigate environmental harm by using more sustainable tillage methods, careful use of exclusion barriers, optimizing fertilizer/pesticide/water inputs and land use. Choosing to not use pesticides and only use organic fertilizers sounds like a great idea, until you lose more than half of your crop to pests, voiding any ecological benefits you thought would occur!\n\nIf you know anything about CEC (cation exchange capacity), how soil is developed, biodiversity in soil and the soil life web you we never make statements like this. The use of salt based fertilizers do not enter the soil food web, in fact they kill parts of it off, so those nutrients do not get locked up, then run off into streams/rivers and contaminate the water supply. \n\nLets look at the midwest of the USA where most corn and soy for feed purposes is grown. In the last 50 years we've lost more than half of the top soil and in another 60, we probably wont have [anymore](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/). This is causes by monoculture, run off, essentially dead soil (microbes are the glue in soil that hold it together) and fallowing the land.\n\nAs for yields, yes, traditional \"conventional\" ag does yield better, but only by [~20%](http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/12/09/organic-conventional-farming-yield-gap/). The big difference here is that organic soil becomes **more** productive the longer your farm it, while \"conventionally\" farmed soil is actually **less** productive the longer you farm on it. So which is really less productive? Year by year, it would seem \"conventional\", but in 100 years, almost definitely organically grown.\n\n\n;You may wonder why I continually use the term \"conventional\" with quotes. Conventional by definition is: based on or in accordance with what is generally done or believed. That type of ag is not generally done or believed. It is also not traditional. We only started this type of ag after WWII when we had an excessive amount of chemical weapons left over, so we started using it as insecticides and herbicides."], [451, "Organic isn't poorly defined.  In the United states it's highly regulated and growers must be certified.\n\nYour theory ignores the cost to the environment from pesticides, herbicides, and chemical fertilizer.  It all depends on what study you look at.  The chemical companies don't like to look bad so there may be some bias in studies.  Did you know many of the chemicals used in us food production are restricted or banned in europe.  We have no idea what some of these chemicals do for sure.  What effects on pregnant women? What effects on developing kids? What about cancer risks?\n\nYour theory ignores that non organic methods are highly dependent on the petrochemical industry.  they're married.  When crude oil goes up, food goes up.   You can't make that cheap fertilizer without petrochemicals.   This means you're funding more wells and the associated pollution and spills.  It means the world food prices (and food security) is tied to petrochemical prices.    Sure organic farms use diesel in tractors, but their dependence on petrochemicals is much less significant.\n\nOrganic means the farms resist being assimilated by the corporate monoculture that controls most of our food supply.    If 80 or 90% of the world grow the same strain of one plant, what happens when an unexpected disease/drought decimates it?  Can you imagine the impact if world corn production dropped by half for a few years?   \n\nOrganic is *appealing* to some consumers, whether you think it should or not.  Market demand is there.

Randomly irradiating crops might lead to some bad stuff. So might monocultures, or even lengthily developed mutations. GMOs have increased global yields, [but might also be linked to the colony collapse disorder](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1051/apido/2010012), dangerously reducing the population of commercial bees. You also see a lot of vegans on the non-GMO train, but where industrial and chemical fertilizers are regulated, non-GMO farmers might use animal fertilizer, supporting the incredibly unsustainable commercial meat industries. Then again small farmers can be sued if accidental cross pollination happens by companies who claim to own a specific gene, not to mention the elbowing out that happens naturally with higher yields sold at lower prices. Of course the best tomatoes I've ever had were from a GMO free local farmer sold at a farmer's market, and even though GMO tomatoes can be made bigger, redder, and in greater quantities, some people just prefer fresher. On that note, lower yields might mean more on-farm resources for a smaller return, but small organic farms might involve less packaging, transportation, and food waste. \n\n\nSo while it might be foolish to be completely anti-GMO, it's just as foolish to be completely anit-Organic.

And yeah, organic pesticides are closer to a form of bacteria than a synthetic insect deterrent, and that can be more dangerous to humans than insecticides or herbicides. And on top of that, organic pesticides are less effective and need to be applied more liberally and more frequently than synthetics.

That is not true: organic farms can use pesticides so long as they are not synthetic. This is an arbitrary distinction, as many organic pesticides are significantly more toxic to humans or more harmful to the environment than synthetic alternatives. Toxicity to humans is mostly a concern for people living near farms or the applicators themselves because by USDA regulations pesticide residues on produce must be at least 100x lower than the lowest dose known to cause harm. Toxicity to the environment is a serious concern, especially for metal-based compounds (eg. copper sulphate) which can bioaccumulate, and synthetic pesticides are often designed with reduced environmental toxicity as a priority.\n\nThere are 25000+ approved pesticides by OMRI (Organic Material Review Institute) for use in the NOP (national organic program) run by the USDA. To point out a few harmful pesticides and try and say that organic pesticides are in general more harmful is naive at best. DDT is a classic example of \"conventional\" ag using a harmful pesticide. Most organic farms on a very large scale will be spraying in the same frequency as a large scale (monoculture) \"conventional\" farm. The difference is many small farms are organic and spray very infrequently, if at all. IPM should be your go to before just spraying.\n\n> Organic also means that the crops are not products of biotechnology (genetically engineered (GE) or \"GMOs\"). However, organic crops can be developed by randomly mutating the crop with methods such as radiation mutagenesis. These old methods are untested, the mutations are uncharacterized, and the crops are sold with zero regulations. An organic farmer could bombard hir seeds with radiation, grow the mutant crops, and sell them to you without a single biochemical test. Meanwhile, GE cultivars are produced over the course of years with careful analysis of the desired mutations, characterizing each change and assessing the effect on the plant - and that process is stringently regulated.\n\nNot one god damn organic farmer is out there radiating seeds for production purposes. I'm sure it's been done on a commercial level, but pretty much everything grown by organic farmers is just a verified organic version of what conventional farmers use. Sungold tomatoes, organic or not, are the same thing and are a hybrid cherry tomato species. Almost all productive crops, are hybrids because of the effects of hybrid vigor; same thing for cornish cross chickens for meat or leghorns for eggs, organic or not. You'll find this true across almost all sectors of agriculture that are attempting to maximize yields.\n\n> More important than the pesticides or the seed development technique used, though, are the direct ecological impacts of farming itself. Modern farming methods are able to mitigate environmental harm by using more sustainable tillage methods, careful use of exclusion barriers, optimizing fertilizer/pesticide/water inputs and land use. Choosing to not use pesticides and only use organic fertilizers sounds like a great idea, until you lose more than half of your crop to pests, voiding any ecological benefits you thought would occur!\n\nIf you know anything about CEC (cation exchange capacity), how soil is developed, biodiversity in soil and the soil life web you we never make statements like this. The use of salt based fertilizers do not enter the soil food web, in fact they kill parts of it off, so those nutrients do not get locked up, then run off into streams/rivers and contaminate the water supply. \n\nLets look at the midwest of the USA where most corn and soy for feed purposes is grown. In the last 50 years we've lost more than half of the top soil and in another 60, we probably wont have [anymore](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/). This is causes by monoculture, run off, essentially dead soil (microbes are the glue in soil that hold it together) and fallowing the land.\n\nAs for yields, yes, traditional \"conventional\" ag does yield better, but only by [~20%](http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/12/09/organic-conventional-farming-yield-gap/). The big difference here is that organic soil becomes **more** productive the longer your farm it, while \"conventionally\" farmed soil is actually **less** productive the longer you farm on it. So which is really less productive? Year by year, it would seem \"conventional\", but in 100 years, almost definitely organically grown.\n\n\n;You may wonder why I continually use the term \"conventional\" with quotes. Conventional by definition is: based on or in accordance with what is generally done or believed. That type of ag is not generally done or believed. It is also not traditional.

You are implying that because something isn't known, we ought to assume it is dangerous. But if you are claiming it is dangerous, the burden is on you to show it. I can't reasonably prove a negative, just as Hans Blix couldn't prove there weren't WMDs in Iraq even though there weren't.

There are unquestionably myriad things used in organic agriculture that a) are chemicals and b) we don't know what they do \"for sure.\" Perhaps organic pesticides of one kind or another will turn out to be extremely dangerous. Perhaps there is an unknown risk of fungal infections being spread from certain types of organic composting. We could speculate endlessly as to hypothetical risks.

And on top of that, organic pesticides are less effective and need to be applied more liberally and more frequently than synthetics.

From The Fruit Orchard (1945), one in a series of books on organic gardening issued by the same publisher [combined snippets]:\n\nOrganic Gardening Series\n\nThis series contains the most valuable reprints from back numbers together with much original material first printed and specially prepared. Organic Gardening is the science and art of feeding plants with organic materials, to produce healthy plants, so that we ourselves can obtain healthy food.\nThe crucial point here is that the people in this movement saw themselves as supplying organic foods (in the nineteenth-century sense of that phrase) rather than inorganic ones to the plants that they were growing. As a result, an organically farmed vegetable is organic not just in the sense that it contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, but in the sense that it doesn't contain artificially abundant quantities of various inorganic elements, because of the way it was grown.\n\nTo like effect is an earlier item from Feed & Farm Supplies (1941) [combined snippets]:\n\nIn many parts of the world, where settled agriculture has only existed for a few decades, experience is necessarily lacking and the unco-ordinated application of modern agricultural technique has had disastrous consequences for the soil. People are more and more turning to \"organic farming\" looking to natural plant covers and organic manures to preserve the soil fertility which human inexperience only destroys. In this country, also, we tend to look back rather wistfully to those days when organic manures and a few recognized crop rotations sufficed to keep the land in good heart for agriculture, although at a level of productivity that would be inadequate to meet our present and future requirements.\nThe movement took off during the 1940s\u2014and by the 1950s, the new understanding of organic was well established. From The Organic Farmer: Farming Without Chemicals, volume 3 (1951) \"\n\n", "id": "d76cokm"}, {"comment": "\"Organic as a chemical description\n\nThe results of a Google Books search for the phrases \"organic foods,\" \"organic diet,\" \"organic farming,\" \"organic gardening,\" and \"organic vegetables\" in works published between 1800 and 1960 corroborate the poster's impression that notions of organic and inorganic chemical composition preceded usage of organic in the sense of healthful, naturally occurring, and/or unadulterated.\n\nMatches for \"organic foods\" in a Google Books search go back as far as 1853. From \u201cAgricultural Chemistry,\u201d in Encyclopedia Britannica, eighth edition (1853):\n\nCarbonic acid, ammonia, and water, are the great organic foods of plants. But while the plant has afforded to it an inexhaustible supply of the last, the quantities of the two former, both in the atmosphere and the soil, which are available as food, are limited, and insufficient to sustain its life for a prolonged period.\nAn explanation of \"organic foods\" appears in An M.D., \u201cThe Theory of Food,\u201d in The Englishman\u2019s Magazine of Literature, Religion, Science, and Art (September 1865):\n\nEvery one knows, I suppose, by this time, the great classification of organic foods which was propounded by Liebig, and which has since been generally accepted. He arranged them under two heads \u2014 the heat-creating, and the tissue-forming foods. The latter, as they one and all contain nitrogen, though in varying proportion, were called nitrogenous, or nutritive ; the former, calorifacient, being for the most part destitute of nitrogen, and containing chiefly carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\nThe distinction between organic and inorganic is more fully addressed in W. H. Broadbent, \u201cAn Attempt to Apply Chemical Principles in Explanation of the Action of Poisons,\u201d in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London (June 18, 1868):\n\nThe operations taking place in the animal organism may be divided into two great classes :\u2014(a) for maintenance of structure, (b) for evolution of force. ...\n\nThe two great classes of food, organic and mineral, are in close relation with these. The organic foods build up the tissues, but ultimately undergo oxidation and yield force. The inorganic foods take a subordinate part in the composition of the textures ; they do not yield force by oxidation, but they influence the nutritive processes.\nThe phrase \"organic diet\" likewise appears in some relatively early serach results. From Dr. Elam, \u201cPopular Physiology,\u201d in The Eclectic Review (January 1861):\n\nThe vegetable cell attracts to itself certain portions of water, carbonic acid, and ammonia, whence it extracts oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and azote, and from these it constructs an albuminous pabulum which serves it for nutrition. The animal cell appears incapable of extracting its nourishment from the inorganic world, and requires absolutely that an organic diet be previously prepared for it. This it attracts to itself, and operates upon until it be fit for its nutriment.\nAnd from John Hobson, The Social Problem: Life and Work (1902):\n\nSo, while each rational man, with what small aid \u201cscience\u201d can afford, must build up a complex organic diet for himself adapted to his individual needs, and changing as those change, he must similarly work out a complex standard of uses of energy. If he is wise, he will shun exactitude and leave \"a broad margin to life,\" a large proportion of his fund of energy and time unallotted to specific purposes ; the rest he will distribute so as to get the widest variety of exercise consistent with such specialization as is demanded by society, or for some private satisfaction.\nIn all of these instances, organic appears in contrast to the alternative inorganic; and in most of them, it is itself subdivided into nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous forms. But the notions of \"natural\" and \"unadulterated\" do not enter into the analysis. Not coincidentally, there are no relevant (and confirmable) matches for the search terms \"organic farming,\" \"organic gardening,\" and \"organic vegetables\" from 1800 through most of the 1930s.\"", "id": "d76cqmj"}, {"comment": "Chemically yes.

Since 10...I ain't touched em (except turning off XPS stuff). The following is just my own experience.\n\nHaving used this page (BlackViper) in the past at the suggestion of software vendor (Cakewalk immediately comes to mind), there is validity to the concept. As well, home users not using the networking and infrastructure junk built in to pro versions COULD turn off unnecessary background services. Samsung SSD's using Magician make adjustments, as is relevant to settings chosen...\n\nAll in all, aside from having fun tinkering, there seems to be next to no real world benefit from these adjustments on modern (and even modestly appointed older gen hardware) when running 8.1/10. Unless it is necessary due to software incompatibility (which really doesn't exist anymore). \n\nFWIW, I've ran autoCAD, the Adobe collection, Protools, Maya, and anything/everything media related in between while running Windows 10 on a Dell Precision m4800, two homebuilt towers using older hardware (old Q9550, and a 2nd gen i3), as well as on my 2012 Mac mini and 2015 MacBook Pro. The graphic intensive stuff I run exclusively on my Precision, which has a 2.9GHz 3rd gen i7, 32gb ram, and an ATI workstation card. \n\nNone of the above machines - including the q9550 - demonstrate any performance benefits when turning off services since windows 8.1/10. I played around this morning...if there is any benefit, I cannot trace it. However, with respect to the page and the spirit of tinkering / have fun! You really cannot hurt anything but...\n\nBe aware, though, as I recall minor conflicts in the past which - although easily remedied - have potential to give someone with less knowledge and experience a headache.

Hopefully the hospital has medical records for this person.\n\nWith that being said, if you have something which needs to be considered by medical providers for them to determine their treatment options in an emergency, get a medical alert tag and keep a *list* of meds and doses up to date in an easily accessible location, such as on your refrigerator door (or even IN the fridge...seriously, this is a thing.)\n\nWhat might be more beneficial is to keep a laminated list of emergency info, including emergency contacts and medications/conditions you have in your wallet.

I am saying that it will most likely not be the first or last place checked by responding medics unless there is an absolute compelling reason to, such as a note in the wallet saying, \"Hey, check my phone for further details.\"\n\nIt is also dangerous to say, \"paramedics are now trained to look there\" as a factual statement.

He failed to meet the minimum level of functioning for driving for both cognitive functioning and on the road test.  He both believes that the tests and the testers are objective and that he is doing a good job at driving and on the tests.  He thinks he has quick reaction times when one test measured his reaction time to be between 15 to 21 seconds.  \"Normal\" should be about 3 seconds.
