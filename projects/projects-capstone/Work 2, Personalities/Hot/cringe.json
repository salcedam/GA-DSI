I have three sisters, all of which went to the same university as my parents. So the odds were stacked against me as I attended a game with a packed stadium of 25,000+ people and had no choice but to sit next to my sister. She was two years older than me and it was fun hanging out with her since she'd let me party and break out of my parents extremely strict household. \n\n\nSo what I'd began to believe was the inevitable happened. The Kiss Cam zoomed in on my sister and I, since we bear little resemblance to one another... of all my sisters she's the that I look the least like. The moment we were up on the screen, people behind me started shaking my shoulders, egging me on. The two other people in our row who knew that we were brothers and sisters just looked horrified.\n\n\nI did the only thing I could do, I formed an X with my arms and yelled while trying my best to make it easy to lead my lips that \"SHE IS MY SISTER.

I have three sisters, all of which went to the same university as my parents. So the odds were stacked against me as I attended a game with a packed stadium of 25,000+ people and had no choice but to sit next to my sister. She was two years older than me and it was fun hanging out with her since she'd let me party and break out of my parents extremely strict household. \n\n\nSo what I'd began to believe was the inevitable happened. The Kiss Cam zoomed in on my sister and I, since we bear little resemblance to one another... of all my sisters she's the that I look the least like. The moment we were up on the screen, people behind me started shaking my shoulders, egging me on. The two other people in our row who knew that we were brothers and sisters just looked horrified.\n\n\nI did the only thing I could do, I formed an X with my arms and yelled while trying my best to make it easy to lead my lips that \"SHE IS MY SISTER.

The nice thing about ultrasound is that you can show live images. If they would give a shit about the wellbeing of the girls, they would have had her look at the images whilst making the ultrasound, providing an explanation of the images she's seeing on the screen. Then she would have been able to see what images correspond with the position of the ultrasound probe, and it would have been a lot more convincing for her that there is actually no pregnancy (of a certain maturity). Now all we see is indifferent grey images and there's no way to tell what we are actually seeing. Then the most convincing thing to do, in order to show the girl she isn't pregnant is to show her womb. A non pregnant womb can't always be visualised (at least not properly) with an abdominal ultrasound, but getting an image of the empty cavity of the womb is the only way to tell with an ultrasound that someone is not pregnant.\n\nIn conclusion, the people involved are terrible people for setting this whole thing up with good TV in mind, in stead of good care for a mentally troubled girl.

Yes, Kalle Lasn is absolutely correct, and his message is a very important one which is supported by science. The reason that the interviewer gives a lot of resistance isn't necessarily because she is ignorant (although she may be a little stubborn). The problem here is that Lasn's message is too \"heavy-handed\" for the average American to comprehend. This video a little older - probably early 2000s. The messaging of the environmental movement back then was often along these lines \"americans are greedy, overconsumers who need to change their ways\". The reality is that very few americans consider themselves \"greedy\" (even if they are compared with people in developing countries). They probably work hard for their money, they save up for things patiently, they are frugal with their belongings, they buy a lot of presents for their grandchildren, etc. Therefore, when someone like Lasn comes on the TV and demands that people change their behaviour, most people can't even relate or comprehend the message and so they ignore it.\n\nLasn is trying to argue that it is immoral to overconsume. There is certainly some logic to this claim, but it takes quite a few logical steps to get there (consmuption drives production, production requires materials and energy, material extraction and energy production create environmental harms such as climate change and reduce stocks of finite resources, environmental harms and reduced material stocks cause long term impacts for future generations of humans). To someone who is unaware of how the world works, and with no comparison to how others in developing countries actually live, it seems very counterintuitive to \"stop consuming\", especially when we are all raised to be told that a strong economy is important, and that we should all support businesses by purchasings goods. People just switch off when they hear this kind of message. Furthermore, one could argue that reducing consumption on black friday will do very little to address the overall consumption since people simply displace their purchasing to another day. Consider - in a similar situation, environmental groups in the past have campaigned for people to have a \"no buying petrol/gasoline day\". Naturally, people could take part simply by filling up the car on the day before or on the day after, accomplishing nothing.\n\nIf you want to persuade people to consume less, you can't do it by claiming people are immoral for overconsuming. The people's behaviour is a result of the way that their whole society is constructed, and to even begin to unpick this mess, you need to encourage people to question their own beliefs. We need to ask whether perpetual economic growth is actually something that helps us to flourish. We need to persuade clothing companies to make products which last for years, not seasons. We would need to persuade apple or samsung to focus on long-life and resilient phones, maybe a new model once every 10 years, with every phone and tablet designed for future recycling. We would need to ask companies like jaguar, honda, ford, BMW to stop pushing their new models and focus on empowering and supporting the second hand / refurbish car market.

The reason that the interviewer gives a lot of resistance isn't necessarily because she is ignorant (although she may be a little stubborn). The problem here is that Lasn's message is too \"heavy-handed\" for the average American to comprehend. This video a little older - probably early 2000s. The messaging of the environmental movement back then was often along these lines \"americans are greedy, overconsumers who need to change their ways\". The reality is that very few americans consider themselves \"greedy\" (even if they are compared with people in developing countries). They probably work hard for their money, they save up for things patiently, they are frugal with their belongings, they buy a lot of presents for their grandchildren, etc. Therefore, when someone like Lasn comes on the TV and demands that people change their behaviour, most people can't even relate or comprehend the message and so they ignore it.\n\nLasn is trying to argue that it is immoral to overconsume. There is certainly some logic to this claim, but it takes quite a few logical steps to get there (consmuption drives production, production requires materials and energy, material extraction and energy production create environmental harms such as climate change and reduce stocks of finite resources, environmental harms and reduced material stocks cause long term impacts for future generations of humans). To someone who is unaware of how the world works, and with no comparison to how others in developing countries actually live, it seems very counterintuitive to \"stop consuming\", especially when we are all raised to be told that a strong economy is important, and that we should all support businesses by purchasings goods. People just switch off when they hear this kind of message. Furthermore, one could argue that reducing consumption on black friday will do very little to address the overall consumption since people simply displace their purchasing to another day. Consider - in a similar situation, environmental groups in the past have campaigned for people to have a \"no buying petrol/gasoline day\". Naturally, people could take part simply by filling up the car on the day before or on the day after, accomplishing nothing.\n\nIf you want to persuade people to consume less, you can't do it by claiming people are immoral for overconsuming. The people's behaviour is a result of the way that their whole society is constructed, and to even begin to unpick this mess, you need to encourage people to question their own beliefs. We need to ask whether perpetual economic growth is actually something that helps us to flourish. We need to persuade clothing companies to make products which last for years, not seasons. We would need to persuade apple or samsung to focus on long-life and resilient phones, maybe a new model once every 10 years, with every phone and tablet designed for future recycling.

The economy doesn't just change when the supply changes. We have the power of demand, which is just as important if not moreso. We have to vote for leaders who will enact laws of reform and regulations and education, we need to participate in democracy more, we need to change ourselves and buy less wasteful junk we don't need, we need to be smarter consumers and buy high quality goods that are made ethically and sustainably, which very quickly forms a sustainable market that businesses will adapt to. It's really all of the above. I really think being a smart, picky consumer as well as being a businessman who practices sustainability is one of the highest forms of patriotism and pride.

And they're not wrong, individual households are a drop in the bucket compared to corporate pollution but then those same corporations fund ads that tell us to recycle, and it's bs.

Second, apparently the whole conversation centered around what desert to make, and the contest winner was obviously browbeaten into making Cradock's choice of desert, which turned out to be a complete failure in execution, and that apparently annoyed the viewing public who felt that Cradock had ruined this lady's otherwise-perfect dinner.

I'm unfamiliar with the whole thing.", "id": "d9y6sxw"}, {"comment": "Oh, the Leslie Jones issue. I'll try to be as unbiased as possible here (if I err, please inform me!). We all know the Ghostbusters reboot fell far short of expectations, in terms of critical response and box-office yields. It's not really a huge fault of the actors in it since editing and so many other factors influence a final result (Annie Hall was supposed to be a [murder mystery](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0075686/trivia) but last minute it was re-edited and became one of the first romantic-comedies). \n\nHowever, all four of the actresses somewhat became targets from trolls making really shitty comments to their Twitter accounts, with Leslie jones getting the worst of it. There's a rule on Twitter that basically no one can encourage or direct followers to act against another user (kind of like the rule we have here with upvotes or personal attacks). Milo trolled Leslie (I'll try to find screenshots) basically calling her a crybaby for getting hate mail when \"all famous people get some to some extent\"(paraphrase). This was BEFORE she received the offensive tweets in question that eventually led to his ban.\n\nHe basically was trying to capitalize on the general dislike of the film and twist it like \"see? They're calling us sexist for not liking a shitty film because the Left is oppressive!\" It's what he does all the time (he's really good at quips and one-liners, and even among republicans he's seen as a caricature, but he's seen as humorous). Other Twitter users soon after that jumped in and sent really racist and offensive stuff (pictures of Leslie like she's a monkey, images with semen on her face, etc). \n\nMilo undoubtedly is someone that racist shitheads would likely agree with (though without any sense of restraint), but there was no proof that Milo directed, encouraged or ordered anyone to do anything against her. Milo always wants to make it about him and promote himself, so it's somewhat plausible that if shocking things were to be said he'd want to get the credit for it, or that's my opinion. I think he also likely knows that if you do push a group to act a certain way, some will take it waaaay too far (look at how a few bad apples are vandalizing during the \"No Trump\" protests and giving the opposition fuel to deride them as riots).\n\nEither way, Twitter banned Milo for violating the terms of service with regards to \"doxxing\" and personal attacks, but they provided no evidence of said rule-violation. Twitter reserves the right to ban someone for basically whatever reason (I think), and I support their right to do so, but they also inadvertently made Milo a martyr for \"free speech.\" It made him immensely more popular than he ever was, and I think it backfired. [more](https://www.google.com/amp/reason.com/blog/2016/07/20/twitter-bans-milo-yiannopoulos-initiate/amp?client=safari)\n\nI like Leslie Jones. She's outspoken and funny, and even she has claimed to have \"called out\" or bitten back at shitty trolls (in a way that would technically violate the same terms of service Milo supposedly violated, but I see that more as mere philosophical hypocrisy and *not* something worth pursuing in any way). I'm glad she's back, but it really seemed like Milo was made into a \"free speech symbol\" in an attempt to make the issue look resolved (is Twitter really a less offensive place with Milo gone? Nah, it's just missing one troll). \n\nThat's my two cents on it. Milo should have and still should face public condemnation for what he says, but it's also hard to find racism or misogyny and fight it if it's hidden among smaller chat rooms and other less-restrictive areas.

When people say something is a 'fact' it very rarely is. \n\nFirst, the obvious.... you have a home. I can name 10 ways this contributes to your well being. Most people who arent homeless also have heat, money for food, a mobile phone. I can name 10 ways these contribute to your well being. \n\nIn terms of debt.... the main issue woth debt is the cost to service the debt. That is the cost to pay the monthly payment and the interest.  So when someone says they have a million dollars in debt, therefore someone with zero dollars is a million dollars richer needs to take a entry level economics class. \n\nI dont know where you live but I assume it's not America. Because your 'fact' doesnt apply here. 38% of the homeless in America are children. 28% are familes.  34% of sheltered people have cronic substance abuse issues. 23% have SEVERE mental health issue.  In terms of lazy.... 44% percent of homeless have done paid work during the last 30 days. In fact the so call 'working homeless' is the largest growing homeless demographic. This is because 53% of homeless dont have high school degrees and the limited work available to such people is in urban areas where costs of living is often highest.

No, rap has been legitimized, we are in a period of experimentation essentially, with more weight now falling on producers and engineers and pushing the boundary's of whats still rap.

I\u2019ve had to make a few guesses in some ambiguous sections, but I\u2019ve done my best to render the most accurate translation. Note that this means that some sentences are not translated word-for-word. I hope that by means of this translation, I can show the full dose of cringe that native speakers get from reading the original.\n\n_____\n#Translation\n\nA guy from New Zealand meets a fellow Australian while living in England in his mid-20s. He then moved back home to Australia with her. His best friend also lives in Australia.\n\nAfter pussyfooting around with the girl for a couple of years, he proposes to her. The first detail of the wedding that he worried about was the bachelor party. He wanted to go camping for five nights because he doesn\u2019t have many friends in Australia and figured that this is the better choice since he wouldn\u2019t have the attendance numbers to get bottle service and a table at a club. He thought that camping with his friend, his dad, and another friend/person would make him happy as now deceased Australian boxer Larry Foley, which frankly doesn\u2019t sound very happy at all. However, Larry was known for never losing a fight and having any resemblance to him at all would of course be a good omen for his impending life as a married man.\n\nThe best man wanted a list of people to invite to the bachelor party, but the groom-to-be only only put one name on it. He even appears to have a blas\u00e9 attitude about inviting this additional friend at this part of the story, only inviting him because he thinks this other guy might be able to show up. On the first day of the bachelor party, the best man takes the groom-to-be to his fianc\u00e9\u2019s parent\u2019s house for a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d type party for all the people who are going to go camping. *[Translator note: Apparently the fianc\u00e9e has had a sex change at this point, although it may be possible that the criminals dropped the silent e in fianc\u00e9e to form a fianc\u00e9-fianc\u00e9e merger when they got shipped to the Southern hemisphere from England. Such linguistic knowledge is a bit outside of my expertise.]*\n\nThey start up the grill but eventually put the cooked food back(?) in the fridge because it was getting cold, so it might as well get colder faster. The reason the food had gotten cold and not eaten was because no one else had shown up. This means that that one extra friend had let him down by not committing almost an entire week to a bachelor party of someone he presumably doesn\u2019t know that well, considering that he had to be invited through the best man. The groom-to-be blames the best man for this and is embarrassed to have his male fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents find out that he only has one friend and not two. Apparently, the groom-to-be\u2019s father failed to show up as well, which surely compounded the shame.\n\nThe failure by the best man to procure one more friend to show up to the \u201cmeet-and-greet\u201d was deemed to be unforgivable. So much so that they wisely only ended up camping for a single evening, during which the groom was in a bad mood.\n\n**tl;dr New Zealander has almost no one show up to his bachelor party, causes himself to look like a loser in front of his Australian fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents; much like having no one show up to your birthday party, but in addition your in-laws will forever judge you for it**", "id": "d9l4gv0"}, {"comment": "i love that the american translation loses the fact that new zealand and australia are different countries ", "id": "d9lgxzk"}, {"comment": "Sure, they're separate, but it wouldn't REALLY matter if they weren't.", "id": "d9m1l24"}, {"comment": "This is better than the original.

Can we still draw a meaningful comparison between these two reports? How might we go about doing that?\n\nWhat is the reasoning behind the differences in the two studies' methodologies? Are both studies attempting to study the same phenomenon? If not, do their methodologies reflect the differences in their focus? If their methodologies are different, can we draw a meaningful comparison between them?  \n\nWhy did you choose to use this article as your source, and not the NCVS that it cites as its own supporting source?

The charity for this event is Prevent Cancer Foundation, so her comments aren't completely out of left field here, it was relevant to what everyone was there for. We do this charity every year in January so you should definitely check it out if you are into gaming!\n\n>As the runner, I take part of the blame since I did want to have decent control on the commentary. The runner always gets to decide how to commentate his/her run. Some like to be very informative with the glitches in the game, some like to have a more casual environment. I wanted to explain a decent amount, but I'm dressed in a cosplay, it's obviously supposed to be a bit laid back too (crack a few jokes, some of the glitches look pretty funny, etc.).\n\n>Another thing, runners actually practice a lot for this event, not just with the speedrun, but the commentary. I spent a lot of time going over in my head how I would proceed to talk about certain tricks or certain things. Imagine that you have to give a presentation to an audience of...50K people! You are going to want to know what you are going to say for the most part.\n\n>But now imagine that one of the audience members throws you a real curveball of a question on your presentation. Uh oh! Some people fumble with their words, some people freeze up. That's pretty much what happened to me here. I was not prepared and not expecting this type of comment from the audience (the audience really isn't even supposed to say anything, outside of the couch). So it caught me really offguard and I just froze up thinking, \"How can I defuse the situation and not look like a dick trying to get back to talking about the speedrun?\" Usually I like to joke around to calm things down but I knew that wouldn't work here.\n\n>One more thing to mention: I did not hear her say, \"Can you stop?\" There's a lot of background noise, donations being read, people whispering, and you kind of get dialed in on what you are doing. It wasn't really until there was a super dead silence in the room and I could hear her voice breaking that I realized how bad the situation behind me was (I can't see her or anyone else in the room really).\n\n>Also to be clear, we had a discussion together about 2 days after the event, and cleared things up with each other. There are no hard feelings here. I think we'd both agree the situation was awkward and not ideal, but it's in the past.\n\n>This happened over 2 years ago, it's been around. I do wish this would stop popping up. It's been posted here before, it's been on r/videos, it's been on 4chan, even Bam Margera made a stupid blog post about it.

You can run around it and it takes 3 seconds, or try to jump it costing 1 second.  The problem is that you only can jump across successfully 30% of the time.

The charity for this event is Prevent Cancer Foundation, so her comments aren't completely out of left field here, it was relevant to what everyone was there for. We do this charity every year in January so you should definitely check it out if you are into gaming!\n\n>As the runner, I take part of the blame since I did want to have decent control on the commentary. The runner always gets to decide how to commentate his/her run. Some like to be very informative with the glitches in the game, some like to have a more casual environment. I wanted to explain a decent amount, but I'm dressed in a cosplay, it's obviously supposed to be a bit laid back too (crack a few jokes, some of the glitches look pretty funny, etc.).\n\n>Another thing, runners actually practice a lot for this event, not just with the speedrun, but the commentary. I spent a lot of time going over in my head how I would proceed to talk about certain tricks or certain things. Imagine that you have to give a presentation to an audience of...50K people! You are going to want to know what you are going to say for the most part.\n\n>But now imagine that one of the audience members throws you a real curveball of a question on your presentation. Uh oh! Some people fumble with their words, some people freeze up. That's pretty much what happened to me here. I was not prepared and not expecting this type of comment from the audience (the audience really isn't even supposed to say anything, outside of the couch). So it caught me really offguard and I just froze up thinking, \"How can I defuse the situation and not look like a dick trying to get back to talking about the speedrun?\" Usually I like to joke around to calm things down but I knew that wouldn't work here.\n\n>One more thing to mention: I did not hear her say, \"Can you stop?\" There's a lot of background noise, donations being read, people whispering, and you kind of get dialed in on what you are doing. It wasn't really until there was a super dead silence in the room and I could hear her voice breaking that I realized how bad the situation behind me was (I can't see her or anyone else in the room really).\n\n>Also to be clear, we had a discussion together about 2 days after the event, and cleared things up with each other. There are no hard feelings here. I think we'd both agree the situation was awkward and not ideal, but it's in the past.\n\n>This happened over 2 years ago, it's been around. I do wish this would stop popping up. It's been posted here before, it's been on r/videos, it's been on 4chan, even Bam Margera made a stupid blog post about it.

He awakens as Barry leaves, and yet the room is still in disarray as though he really was just there - which means that what just happened was real and couldn't have been just a dream.\n\nAlso, dream manipulation and premonitions are not outside the realm of possibility in the DC universe. Mad Hatter, one of Batman's great foes, is known to have the ability or technology to manipulate dreams. The dreams in the film don't appear to be normal dreams as they appear to have an eerie truth to them. These dreams almost come as warnings as to what is to come. The desert dream warns of Darkseid and the apocalypse he will bring. The Flash dream is a straight up warning to Bruce that these events will happen if he doesn't do something.\n\nSo, I personally believe the dreams were more like premonitions brought on by an external force (perhaps the Flash himself has the technology in the future). If these are premonitions, then they are far more real than any dream.

It's not because the government is corrupt, the reality is most of the tax revenue from the U.S. goes to mandatory programs such as Medicare/Medicaid, Social Security, Unemployment and Disability, etc. These are all social welfare programs and they are obviously the most expensive programs. As you can see, there is not a single penny of the federal budget that \"goes into the pockets of one-percenters\". The highest tax bracket for these \"one-percenters\" is 39.6% and that's not including sales tax, FICA, state taxes, property taxes, etc. If you factor in all those other taxes, you'll likely look at nearly 50% of your income being taxed. It has nothing to do with corporate tax rate either, the U.S. has a significantly higher corporate tax rate then anywhere in Scandinavia. The real difference is population size, all of Scandinavia is slightly smaller than the population of the state of Texas. A single state in the U.S. has more people than all of Scandinavia combined.

The politicians are the public face of the elite corporatocracy in the world.

ESPECIALLY in a country where consumerism culture is the religion of acceptance in the present day.

Basics like observation of history through the passing of time such as:\n\nAlan Greenspan proposes and installs the disintegration of market regulations and laws... Decades later, we have the near collapse of the global economy etc..\n\nIf you are honest with yourself and aim for objectivity, there is no need to justify and waste time thinking about what went wrong, simply cut your losses and work off the fact what that guy has done, has not worked for the benefit of the collective whole.

", "id": "daovtix"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "dap05t4"}, {"comment": "> What she is doing is not morally wrong - it's just really dumb.\n\nThat's my concern. If she were someone who had done her homework, I'd say she was an adult making adult decisions. Legally, that's what she is - but in reality some people mature faster than others and there's nothing magic about reaching Age of Consent that makes people immediately understand everything on their birthday.\n\nShe comes across as someone who has not thought her decision through. And since it's a relatively risky decision, she really should have.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with sex and nothing fundamentally wrong with selling sex - but it's a profession fraught with dangers that she appears not to have given any thought at all.\n\n> everyone here is acting as if shes committing an act of murder\n\nI reiterate - there is nothing morally wrong with her plan. She is not harming anyone except potentially herself. There is a difference between \"morally wrong\" and \"dumb\". I can't speak for everyone else, but I am only accusing her of being one of those. \n\n>  yet literally thousands of people around the world have unprotected sex with strangers and call it a one night stand.\n\nHaving a one-night stand with a stranger is inherently risky. When I have had one-night stands, I have at least had a few preliminary conversations first to make sure I get a good vibe from them. That's not completely foolproof, of course, but it weeds out some of the more obviously-bad ideas. I also made sure to meet them somewhere public to have that preliminary conversation, so that I wouldn't be alone with them before I'd at least done a rudimentary sanity check. There were still risks, and I did what I could to mitigate them. The risks I could do nothing about, I felt like I was okay with.\n\nThat's all very different from what she is doing - she's considered none of that.

I'm working on a retro futuristic game right now and I get these little voices you speak of all the time. Maybe I'm wasting my time? Wtf who's gonna pay for that... Then you snap out of it a week later and you're like nah, game's nice, I just have to keep working on it, it'll be a fun game.\n\nAs for the little guy with the clown looking haircut, he is a complete tool and a piece of shit with no respect. If he thought the game was shit, there would be better ways to go about it than to put him down like that. Even insulting the time it took to get to the point the game is, I found that part most funny. It undeniably shows that he is clueless when it comes to game development and the grind that comes with it. He probably caters to kids around the age of 12 to 13, just your typical twitch streamer/youtuber turning tricks to little kids, playing the ploy of a daily cartoon to make a living.\n\nThe moment their circus crashes and their viewership dwindles, is the moment their life is in jeopardy. They usually have no ambitions and I believe there are actually cartoon youtubers who dropped out of school to do Youtube as a \"full-time job\", a ridiculous and reckless moves unless you've reached Markiplier/Pewdiepie levels, generating millions of views per video, and even then, your viewer base will still undeniably tank at one point or another.\n\nWe usually don't hear of these horror stories too much but there are plenty of youtubers that made it big back in 2010-2011 only to inevitably fall in limbo. WoodysGamertag comes to mind, he used to pull around 500k per video, and started living off of youtube IIRC. Now look at him, weak numbers across. There are plenty more but I can't think right now. Many older CoD youtubers are in that barrel as people have gradually stopped giving a shit about CoD.\n\nAll things considered, the game doesn't even look too bad. Instead, it could be described as whacky which I think is the point of such a game. For most of this post, I'm going to make a parallel with \"Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden\" as TopCaster seems to be trying to pull some of the same string.\n\nBarkley shows how looks can be deceiving. Graphics are all over the place, the plot is as whacky as whacky can be and yet and yet, it's one of the most emotional piece of video game out there and can only be described as art. The music would also fit right at home in a final fantasy classic, and it'd be some of the best music in the series. (the boss theme is absolutely legendary, one of the greatest boss theme I've heard) Inconsistent graphics are usually bad, but there is a certain way that it can be approached such that it creates a stark contrast between the different elements of the game which can only be described as whacky. It's a very potent source of game design which is difficult to harness, and it has to be done masterfully. (Barkley)\n\nThere are only a handful of ways to properly pull it off. One such way as in Barkley, is to create the contrast in the plot itself, by devising a plot that is completely ridiculous but actually ends up being taken VERY seriously, with very serious complications. It makes commoners like us connect on a more personal level with the characters as we can relate more easily, believe or not. Another way as seems to be the case in the game, is to put the emphasis on the contrast created by weird elements that do not seem to fit together. (For example, a wrestling video game where Stephen Hawking wrestles with a shark that shoots laser out of its eyes) It's totally whacky, but you do not want good graphics for such a game. You want a complete visual mess with funny audio and over the top sound effects, it creates this odd contrast that I've been talking about.\n\nThe problem with TopCaster seems to be that the contrast is confused and muddled. In some parts, it's great. In others, not so much. For example, if we look at [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/VSOTbLI.png) from the sneak peek trailer, (which is a year and a half old, may be inaccurate) The whacky contrast is not clear. It's not clear whether it's a crappy game, or crappy on purpose. The player character and enemies have serious looking sprites, the terrain looks somewhat lame but not lame enough that it could be said that it's lame on purpose. I do however enjoy the icons like the anime waifu that is completely out of place.\n\n[This screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/EWQQKSK.png) from the latest trailer however, it much better. Why is cartoony-looking player fighting a man with no legs and a cut off arm who is summoning lightning? Complete nonsense, just what the game needs. I would argue that to make this better, an actual real-life picture of a human should be use rather than a drawn asset.\n\nSee where I'm going? It's not exactly clear what is the direction of this game. A serious actual game that is trying to stand out? Or whacky and shitty on purpose but actually-is-pretty-good? Hm...\n\nFor all I know, the game could be fun, so I'm not going to criticize the gameplay from this short trailer. The user interface and HUD elements do look pretty bad and unmatching, this needs to be said. As for the price, I think $20 is over the top, it should be 5 or 10, at most. The problem with whacky games like that is that you can't ask for too much, because the first sentiment that is emanated is that it's a poorly made game. Barkley is free but couldn't be sold for more than $5, despite being worth a lot more to a lot of people who have played it. With these kinds of game, you have to lower the barrier of entry with a low price and simply make the game excellent so that word to mouth will get the game out and make it sell like hot breads.", "id": "d9xcck6"}, {"comment": "Don't mind me, I'll just be in *DAMAGE CONTROL OVERDRIVE*", "id": "d9v4uo6"}, {"comment": "Dead on.

Had respiratory failure on the 2nd, and intubated until the 10th or 11th. Missed all of SGDQ but what can you do. I was told I had Guillain Barre Syndrome but I have no idea, symptoms didn\u2019t match up in order.\n\nBeing intubated and awake was an experience as well as first time having spinal tap twice. First two days of being intubated was fine, afterwards it became extremely demoralizing. I was glad I was able to still write down anything to communicate with the staff and family. I didn\u2019t really understood the ventilator until the first night or second, trying to keep up with a weakened diaphragm and other muscles around it was a bad idea. Secretion suctions down your throat were pretty rough, especially when it became thick and they needed to lavage to loosen it. Feeding tubes sucks, especially when your throat starts to swell up from having something obstructing it, doesn\u2019t help I accidentally bit into the tube at one point and it became really noisy [pretty much having compressed air can next to each ear blasting away] for until a respiratory therapist (RT) plugged the hole. Eventually I had the feeding tube replaced with one that went down your nose, don\u2019t remember what it was called, TIGER or something that went through your nose down to your intestines. Extremely itchy around your nasal cavity every time you swallowed it was like something was scratching between your nasal cavity and your throat. At one point a nurse grabbed it and started to spin it around like a tassel, pretty rude. Spinal tap wise, first one was fine, second was 3 days later and that one hurts pretty bad down my right leg and back.\n\nAfter extubation, being able to use mouthwash was the most refreshing thing I have ever felt, spent my first hour just trying to rinse. Afterwards it was a tight diet of ice chips for a couple days.\n\nI was admitted back to the hospital on the 16th to 17th for breathing problems and total leg weakness, but that cleared up pretty quick.\n\nICU staff are pretty amazing and I enjoyed my experience with all of the RTs between both hospitals I was at as well as most of the nurses. Even though I was woken up every hour for symptom checks and prodded with needles multiple times throughout each day.\n\nCurrently face is still partially paralyzed more so on the left, throat is recovering from the tubes, respiratory system still sucks a bit but getting better. Can\u2019t really read for more than an hour since my left eye can\u2019t focus for very long. Fatigue apparently brings back all of the symptoms I had before so that sucks a bit, especially progressive fatigue throughout the day eventually notice it anyways.\n\nIt\u2019s been a rough and interesting month so far, and I want to thank my family for being supportive through the shittiness.", "id": "d9wy8i5"}], [{"comment": "I feel bad for Harmon but I don't know why he didn't do a little more research.

What would have?"], [17, "Don't worry bruv. I had a panic attack in front of a class of about 30 people in university whilst giving a presentation. I just ran out of the room. It was pretty cringe. "], [18, "Here's a couple of tricks I learned which made this process significantly easier. I used to be the guy who would freak out to the point of almost passing out (I feinted at least once, maybe more, don't really remember), but I eventually figured out that it was because I would focus too much on rehearsing and focus on the final product and freak out if anything felt even slightly off. Don't rehearse the thing a bunch, but learn the material better and practice explaining it as if it's one on one until you really get it. Treat your whole presentation like you're teaching one on one and just focus on that (even though it's going to be something different most likely). Do run through it however to know where you're going, why, and what the whole structure is, but don't sit there and do the presentation 20 times; just do it enough you know what topic is coming up and how it relates to your presentation. Having to improv but knowing what the punchline is is better than trying to think of the punchline when all you know is the lead up.\n\nThe way I got to avoid the nervous stutters was to just not allow myself to use \"uhhh\" or anything else like it (\"like\", \"umm\", \"well\", \"so...\", \"okay\", etc.) in normal speech and any other situations I was in (where it would just be a filler word and not part of what I was saying). That \"awkward pause\" or \"awkward silence\" isn't that awkward if you're confident about it (or, at least not unconfident about it). The \"awkward silence\" with confidence can also be almost like a challenge to other people, a show of dominance and strength even. Don't let it be awkward and accept it will happen when you're thinking, and people will think you're either contemplative or letting people sit on your words, instead of struggling for words.\n\nMost people in presentation based classes also have to go through it themselves. They don't want to be the person who calls someone out or tries to stir things up unless they really are interested or are grade A assholes. The two are very noticeably different. No one is going to call you out or be inquisitive unless they care since the asshole you can see a mile away has already been kicked from the class or told to shut up after the first time. In presentation type classes, the teacher has no qualms telling that guy to shut up and not speak unless it's something positive or a genuine question. You just won't run into it more than once ever, even in a class full of assholes, and if you do, your grade is pretty much sealed as compensation for being the one that the teacher needed to find the asshole.\n\nAnother thing which can help is if someone is trying to test your knowledge or call you out, just accept you don't know and don't try and bullshit if you don't know. Confidently and very coolly and collectedly stating you don't know something is a million times better than pretending you know and trying to BS your way through it. If it's on the tip of your tongue and you can't recall, just say you looked over it, but can't recall at the moment. Treat it like it's just a minor detail as long as it isn't something integral to what you're doing, and if it is, very calmly state your nerves are getting to you and most people will accept it. Staying cool and calm, but admitting you don't know will make you look significantly more confident and knowledgeable than knowing everything and being even a little shaky.\n\nHopefully this helps you avoid awkward speeches. I worked as a teacher for years and ended up having to fill in for subjects I really knew pretty much nothing about. Calmness, collectedness, coolness, confidence, and honesty made me pretty much the favorite teacher of any school I was at. To this day, if you give me a subject and expect me to give a speech on it, even to experts, I can do it without freaking out, even if I barely know what the subject is let alone anything about it. Accept your flaws, appear confident even if you aren't confident, don't overprepare to the point of failute, accept that you can't control the audience, and accept you're human, and you'll be able to make it without freaking out. Obviously, it's easier said than done."], [4, "You done it yet? how did it go?"], [2, "You'd be surprised how many people use propanolol for things like this.

", "id": "dalwnm8"}], [{"comment": "Here's a couple of tricks I learned which made this process significantly easier. I used to be the guy who would freak out to the point of almost passing out (I feinted at least once, maybe more, don't really remember), but I eventually figured out that it was because I would focus too much on rehearsing and focus on the final product and freak out if anything felt even slightly off. Don't rehearse the thing a bunch, but learn the material better and practice explaining it as if it's one on one until you really get it. Treat your whole presentation like you're teaching one on one and just focus on that (even though it's going to be something different most likely). Do run through it however to know where you're going, why, and what the whole structure is, but don't sit there and do the presentation 20 times; just do it enough you know what topic is coming up and how it relates to your presentation. Having to improv but knowing what the punchline is is better than trying to think of the punchline when all you know is the lead up.\n\nThe way I got to avoid the nervous stutters was to just not allow myself to use \"uhhh\" or anything else like it (\"like\", \"umm\", \"well\", \"so...\", \"okay\", etc.) in normal speech and any other situations I was in (where it would just be a filler word and not part of what I was saying). That \"awkward pause\" or \"awkward silence\" isn't that awkward if you're confident about it (or, at least not unconfident about it). The \"awkward silence\" with confidence can also be almost like a challenge to other people, a show of dominance and strength even. Don't let it be awkward and accept it will happen when you're thinking, and people will think you're either contemplative or letting people sit on your words, instead of struggling for words.\n\nMost people in presentation based classes also have to go through it themselves. They don't want to be the person who calls someone out or tries to stir things up unless they really are interested or are grade A assholes. The two are very noticeably different. No one is going to call you out or be inquisitive unless they care since the asshole you can see a mile away has already been kicked from the class or told to shut up after the first time. In presentation type classes, the teacher has no qualms telling that guy to shut up and not speak unless it's something positive or a genuine question. You just won't run into it more than once ever, even in a class full of assholes, and if you do, your grade is pretty much sealed as compensation for being the one that the teacher needed to find the asshole.\n\nAnother thing which can help is if someone is trying to test your knowledge or call you out, just accept you don't know and don't try and bullshit if you don't know. Confidently and very coolly and collectedly stating you don't know something is a million times better than pretending you know and trying to BS your way through it. If it's on the tip of your tongue and you can't recall, just say you looked over it, but can't recall at the moment. Treat it like it's just a minor detail as long as it isn't something integral to what you're doing, and if it is, very calmly state your nerves are getting to you and most people will accept it. Staying cool and calm, but admitting you don't know will make you look significantly more confident and knowledgeable than knowing everything and being even a little shaky.\n\nHopefully this helps you avoid awkward speeches. I worked as a teacher for years and ended up having to fill in for subjects I really knew pretty much nothing about. Calmness, collectedness, coolness, confidence, and honesty made me pretty much the favorite teacher of any school I was at. To this day, if you give me a subject and expect me to give a speech on it, even to experts, I can do it without freaking out, even if I barely know what the subject is let alone anything about it. Accept your flaws, appear confident even if you aren't confident, don't overprepare to the point of failute, accept that you can't control the audience, and accept you're human, and you'll be able to make it without freaking out. Obviously, it's easier said than done.", "id": "dak183y"}, {"comment": "This is some great advice. Thanks for typing it out.

Valets would never be able pay it back.", "id": "da8gyan"}, {"comment": "can confirm u/morto00x's statement, I worked for a valet company for 6 years, 2 years as weekend MOD (manage on duty).  Having a conversation with a customer about their damaged car is never fun, especially because our insurance company required that we not say anything along the lines of \"don't worry, insurance will cover it.\"  Or, \"yeah, definitely, this is our fault, we will pay for the damage.\"  \n\nSo many times I had customers try to coax those statements out of me and getting verbally abused for not reassuring them.  You have to understand, though; insurance companies need to do a full report and make sure that the accident wasn't due to the car's mechanical failure and was, in fact, driver error.  Same as they would for any accident.  \n\nJust a PSA, if you ever valet, remember these important ten commandments for valeting your vehicle:\n\n1.  Valet drivers are a very young demographic, and probably have less driving experience than you\n\n2.  Valet drivers definitely have less experience driving your particular car\n\n3.  A valet zone can be a fast-paced, stressful environment that creates danger even when proper precautions are being observed.\n\n4.  Accidents happen, if you parked 150-300 cars in one night in some tight spaces, the odds are in favor of at least a minor scrape or momentary lapse in judgment\n\n5.  Most valets make minimum wage and don't get a share of the curb fee.  Tips go along way in the care of your vehicle.  Not saying intentional damage occurs, but placement in the parking ramps and lots can play a role in likely damage.  I will gladly keep a mid-90's Geo metro close by the zone for a good tip, rather than have a pretty Ferrari to look at and hate my life when the driver doesn't tip.\n\n6.  Don't get pissed if we move your seat, especially if you're extra tall or extra short.  We try to move them back, but even the most professional valets will get it wrong on occasion.  \n\n7.  If you have a giant fucking truck or ridiculously sized vehicle, it's not our job to accommodate you.  If we don't have space, we don't have space.  If you valet your lifted Diesel F350 super-duty pickup because it's a pain in the ass to park downtown (or wherever you are), imagine how much of a pain in the ass it is for the valets.  Be considerate and understand that the world was not designed for vehicles that size.  \n\n8.  No, we cannot keep your car up front because you decided to bring your dog to dinner.  Not only are dogs an extra liability issue for our insurance company, but that sweet little cute adorable puppers that you love so much, might be a competely different dog with strangers around, getting in and out of your car, making lots of noise, etc.  Leave your dog at home or park it yourself.  I never thought I would deal with this so much as a valet, but it was at least a weekly occurence.  Don't do it.\n\n9.  To reduce wait times, be ahead of the game.  If possible, bring your ticket out ten or fifteen minutes before expected departure and your vehicle will be waiting for you when you leave.  This is especially important on busy or cold nights.  Some restaurants will even let you give the ticket to the server, who will then bring it to us.  I love this foresight by people.  \n\n10.  most importantly, valet parking is a luxury, not a right inherent to you for going to a particular establishment.  There are plenty of parking or travel options, all of which have their benefits and potential dangers.  Valet is no different.  \n\nedit:  removed a word\n", "id": "da9v3ol"}, {"comment": "I doubt it.
