I've tattooed all over the world and back in the 90s, when regular conventions were a new thing and there weren't more than 15 on the planet in any given year. I was one of about 100 people \"on tour\", tattooing in a different city every month or so, and did so until I broke my back in 2002 and stopped traveling until just a couple years ago. \n\nI've seen fresh *and* healed tattoos from *thousands* of tattooers and the fact is, was, and shall always be, that fresh tattoos *rarely* look like they do healed. The single exception is properly done old school/new school work with a heavy outline and solid, completely saturated colors that are done correctly. \n\n*The best* tattooers do a tattoo based on what it's going to look like in a month or two, rather than doing what looks good on the day and calling it good, since only a healed tattoo is going to show you that not only was the artwork done well, but the mechanics of the tattoo are first quality also. You can do a beautiful tattoo where less than half the pigment is deep enough to heal solidly, yet it'll look great the day it was done, which is exactly what those pics show.\n\nOtherwise you wouldn't see so damned many black and grey pieces witg all the light tones faded out and few if any dark contrasting areas. *Everything* in a B&G tattoo looks darker the day it's done, and some of the lightest greys fade for up to a year. \n\nColor realism is a particularly tricky technique, and I've seen way too many tattooers who do a nice painting with a rotary tattoo machine (because they didn't do a proper apprenticeship and were never taught the ins and outs of coil machine tuning and setup) that looks great the day it was done, but who don't understand the principles of color saturation and how much ink really needs to be in the skin and how deep it needs to be for those colors to remain solid when it's healed or even half a dozen years old. Most of these people work the hundreds of conventions per year, never really spending much time in the shop, and never even see their healed work unless a client returns a year later or sees them at another convention in another city. \n\nYeah, there's great tattooers doing this stuff whose work retains its luster and saturation, but they're rare as hen's teeth. And this is why portfolios filled with pics of fresh tattoos and very few healed tattoos are misleading in the extreme. In my portfolios at work and online, the *only* tattoos that are fresh in the pics are tattoos I never saw again. Most portrait and realistic pieces are photographed when they're. *minimum* of three months old.

It is always a good idea to compile reference material and have at least a basic concept for your design.  If you do have a rough sketch or even a design that you believe is finished, listen to your tattoo artist when they suggest revisions and/or redesigning the piece.  A lot of factors go into a good tattoo design, and what looks good on paper may not work for the medium.\n\n**Watercolor tattoos and other designs without bold outlines do not typically age well.**  See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/3gulyy/monarch_butterflies_tattoo_by_adam_sky_rose_golds/cu1rd5l) from /u/Tattoodles:\n\n>From a technical standpoint I always surround color application with black ink. Color tattooing that stands the test of time requires either a black outline or black shading to not only create contrast but to also encapsulate color. Color application left on it's own without black ages badly. It may look great when just applied but after a few years when the tattoo starts to settle in and fade a bit, the structure of the tattoo will dramatically fall apart.\nJust about every ten years you'll see a resurgence in tattooing that abandons the tradition of applying black outlines and using color on it's own. What's now called 'watercolor' is the latest generation of new tattooers foray in to this cyclical mistake. After a few years when we start to see these tattoos come back with deteriorating structure, this style will get abandoned, just like it does every ten years when the latest generation of new tattooers realized through experience that tattooing has traditions, limitations and technical rules for a reason. So because of my observations of how tattoos age after 25 years of doing this job, the 'watercolor' style is a style I avoid because I want my work to age gracefully.\n\n>TL;DR: There's an old saying in tattooing... \"Half black or half whack\", so no watercolor style for me. \n\n**Why can't we discuss aftercare?**  Unfortunately, people who do not know what they are talking about love to give their two cents.  For this reason, we do not allow aftercare questions here.  If you have any questions or concerns, talk to your tattoo artist.\n\n**Constructive criticism is encouraged here.**  While we do not allow comments like \"ur tat is shit, m8,\" we do encourage constructive, *educated* criticism.  The most important function of /r/tattoos is to educate people about what is good and bad about execution and designs.

Bold will hold, as the saying goes.\n\n>If you make the piece too small and still try to squeeze in a lot of detail, the lines that are too close together will blur over time.  The same thing goes for other styles, including traditional and neo-traditional.\n\n>With tattoo longevity, bigger is always better.  Ink spreads and fades over time.  A skilled artist with work with you to find a good compromise between size, detail, and optimal placement.\n\n>As always, the most important thing that you can do is research potential artists carefully.  Never impulse buy, and never bargain shop.  Find someone with a large portfolio that contains zero shitty pieces.  Ideally, you want to see healed and aged pieces in addition to freshly-tattooed ones, but that can be difficult to find if the artist does not have an ongoing relationship with some of their clients.  \n\n>Be sure that the artist has several examples of the style of tattoo that you are looking for in their portfolio.  Some artists specialize in a specific style because that is what they excel at.  Those are often the people that you want to make permanent alterations to your appearance, but you may have to book an appointment several months in advance.\n\nSource:  my comment, also from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/4mbgyt/water_color_dragon_markered_and_tattooed_by_jinx/d3ufsbo)"], [1, "Can I post a picture of work I already have completed and ask for ideas on how to add to it?"], [1, "Where can I ask about different types of tatoos?

A post which outlines some of the common ways that various stages can go would be great.  Something along the lines of this:.\n\nMost shops and artists have slightly different processes that they follow, but the general process goes like this:\n\n1) You decide you want to get a tattoo.  For some people this is an easy decision.  Others will spend a long time thinking about it.  Bear in mind, this is something that will be on your body for the rest of your life.  \n2) You need to find an artist.  There are a bunch of ways to do this.  These days, most artists have their portfolios online - this is a great way to find someone with a style you like.  When you find an artist whose work you like, examine what you see using the [/r/tattoos \"How to examine a portfolio\" guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/mcpr1/collectors_and_those_thinking_of_getting_a/).    \n3) Make your booking.  Some stores will allow you do this online.  Some will take bookings over the phone.  Others will want you to come into the store so you can complete the next stage at the same time.  \n4) Talk to your artist about what you want.  Where you want it, etc.  While we don't talk about pricing here, this is the time for you to get a good understanding of how much the tattoo will cost you.  \n5) Tattoo day!  Go to the store.  Wear comfortable, loose clothes on the area that will be covering your tattoo.  *I've only had the one tattoo, so I don't actually have a lot of tattoo day advice here - I'd love guidance from someone in the community*.  \n6) Aftercare - it's important to follow the advice of your artist if you want your tattoo to heal well.  For more tips, see the /r/tattoos [aftercare guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/egafj/healing_process/c17vj2k)\n\n**Edit:** I'm actually looking for this - I get nervous on tattoo day.  And I've stumbled with the booking process a couple of times - my first tattoo artist did all the bookings via email, and the tattoo artist that I'm looking to book right now, only takes bookings in person.

A lot of factors go into a good tattoo design, and what looks good on paper may not work for the medium.\n\n**Watercolor tattoos and other designs without bold outlines do not typically age well.**  See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/3gulyy/monarch_butterflies_tattoo_by_adam_sky_rose_golds/cu1rd5l) from /u/Tattoodles:\n\n>From a technical standpoint I always surround color application with black ink. Color tattooing that stands the test of time requires either a black outline or black shading to not only create contrast but to also encapsulate color. Color application left on it's own without black ages badly. It may look great when just applied but after a few years when the tattoo starts to settle in and fade a bit, the structure of the tattoo will dramatically fall apart.\nJust about every ten years you'll see a resurgence in tattooing that abandons the tradition of applying black outlines and using color on it's own. What's now called 'watercolor' is the latest generation of new tattooers foray in to this cyclical mistake. After a few years when we start to see these tattoos come back with deteriorating structure, this style will get abandoned, just like it does every ten years when the latest generation of new tattooers realized through experience that tattooing has traditions, limitations and technical rules for a reason. So because of my observations of how tattoos age after 25 years of doing this job, the 'watercolor' style is a style I avoid because I want my work to age gracefully.\n\n>TL;DR: There's an old saying in tattooing... \"Half black or half whack\", so no watercolor style for me. \n\n**Why can't we discuss aftercare?**  Unfortunately, people who do not know what they are talking about love to give their two cents.  For this reason, we do not allow aftercare questions here.  If you have any questions or concerns, talk to your tattoo artist.\n\n**Constructive criticism is encouraged here.**  While we do not allow comments like \"ur tat is shit, m8,\" we do encourage constructive, *educated* criticism.  The most important function of /r/tattoos is to educate people about what is good and bad about execution and designs.  Even if it is too late for a person who has gotten a sub-par tattoo, that person's misfortune may help others avoid making the same mistake.  It can also help the OP make a better decision next time.  ", "id": "d296qpz"}, {"comment": "**More information about watercolor tattoo longevity**\n\n>That is because it is a new trend, and tattoos typically take years to deteriorate.  Watercolor does not age well, and there is more info in the comments section of the stickied post at the top of the subreddit. \n\n>There is a very good reason that traditional tattoos are designed to be simple, bold, and have a black outline.  That is the tried-and-true formula for longevity.  Tattoos have become increasingly mainstream since the 90s, with many innovations in both technique and materials.  However, a lot of younger artists that branch out into trendy techniques do not have the decades of experience to anticipate what these flashy pieces will look like in 10-20+ years.  Customers want to follow current styles, and artists need to make a living.  The watercolor trend will eventually die due to poor aging and looking dated like all fads (remember 90's tribal).  Many of us warning against permanently inking a watercolor piece on your body have been around through a generation or more of body modification fads, and do not want to see young people repeat the mistakes of our generation.\n\n>All of this aside, the OP is a solid artist, and I trust that he has thoroughly discussed all concerns with his client.  Sometimes you have to give people what they want, even if you know that it isn't optimal in the long run.\n\n>Also, there have been some posts by early adopters of the watercolor fad.  They demonstrated the terrible way that bright and pastel colors with no outline age in as few as five years.  I am sorry, but I do not have links readily available.  I know that saying \"you'll see that we were right in a few years\" isn't a compelling argument, but I do hope that people who are considering something other than proven design elements will at least be aware of the potential pitfalls.  We have no other motivation here than to try to help people learn how to get the best possible tattoos for them.\n\nSource:  my comment from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/4mbgyt/water_color_dragon_markered_and_tattooed_by_jinx/d3ufsbo)", "id": "d3upoe5"}, {"comment": "So I'm not trying to be a dick here, and I'm genuinely asking but...it's not new.

The same thing goes for other styles, including traditional and neo-traditional.\n\n>With tattoo longevity, bigger is always better.  Ink spreads and fades over time.  A skilled artist with work with you to find a good compromise between size, detail, and optimal placement.\n\n>As always, the most important thing that you can do is research potential artists carefully.  Never impulse buy, and never bargain shop.  Find someone with a large portfolio that contains zero shitty pieces.  Ideally, you want to see healed and aged pieces in addition to freshly-tattooed ones, but that can be difficult to find if the artist does not have an ongoing relationship with some of their clients.  \n\n>Be sure that the artist has several examples of the style of tattoo that you are looking for in their portfolio.  Some artists specialize in a specific style because that is what they excel at.

I've had a tattoo done in Ireland, and I'm planning another one in the US, and being a bit awkward about it, I've make the whole thing a lot more difficult for myself.  A post which outlines some of the common ways that various stages can go would be great.  Something along the lines of this:.\n\nMost shops and artists have slightly different processes that they follow, but the general process goes like this:\n\n1) You decide you want to get a tattoo.  For some people this is an easy decision.  Others will spend a long time thinking about it.  Bear in mind, this is something that will be on your body for the rest of your life.  \n2) You need to find an artist.  There are a bunch of ways to do this.  These days, most artists have their portfolios online - this is a great way to find someone with a style you like.  When you find an artist whose work you like, examine what you see using the [/r/tattoos \"How to examine a portfolio\" guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/mcpr1/collectors_and_those_thinking_of_getting_a/).    \n3) Make your booking.  Some stores will allow you do this online.  Some will take bookings over the phone.  Others will want you to come into the store so you can complete the next stage at the same time.  \n4) Talk to your artist about what you want.  Where you want it, etc.  While we don't talk about pricing here, this is the time for you to get a good understanding of how much the tattoo will cost you.  \n5) Tattoo day!  Go to the store.  Wear comfortable, loose clothes on the area that will be covering your tattoo.  *I've only had the one tattoo, so I don't actually have a lot of tattoo day advice here - I'd love guidance from someone in the community*.  \n6) Aftercare - it's important to follow the advice of your artist if you want your tattoo to heal well.  For more tips, see the /r/tattoos [aftercare guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/egafj/healing_process/c17vj2k)\n\n**Edit:** I'm actually looking for this - I get nervous on tattoo day.

You get the chance to take a look at the shop, judge your artists character (are they shady? Do they know what they are talking about? Do you feel comfortable around them?). I would suggest calling ahead, ask when your artist is available for a session and if you like what you hear (not a year from now, or the timing is perfect) ask for a consultation. It doesn't take too long and that is the best time to show the artist what you want, and maybe as those questions about placement, color and size. Once you are both on the same page, book your appointment. I have always payed a one hour deposit on my booking.

Let me explain you why:      \nEvolution also gave us also lots of other things, one of them it's ethics. Our ancestors stole, murdered, raped and did lots of things that we consider nowadays morally wrong. So we must be critic with what our ancestors (and we) used to do.\n\nWe're omnivores, that's a fact, I absolutely agree with you here, but it means that we *can* eat meat, not that we *must*. As I just said, we also can punch weaker people and rape women, but it doesn't mean that we must, therefore we must consider ethically out actions. Since there's an option to avoid meat (with is cruel -- see sentiocentrism) then it's not a necessity anymore, just \"a pleasure\" that is commonly done worldwide but it's ethically wrong since we're unnecessary killing billions of animals under these kind of myths.\n\nSo, there's [lots of fallacies](http://www.yourveganfallacyis.com) (lions, plants, deserted island, canines, protein, ...) So it's normal that people still do it (and will keep it in the same way for years) but there's more world beyond \"meat\" and I think it's necessary that people know that.\n\nIf you want anything just let me know ;)", "id": "dapl63t"}, {"comment": "You just compared the morality of rape to the morality of eating meat.

People create murals on the sides of buildings or craft amazing landscape pieces, or recreate scenes from a book or movie. They all could have meaning behind them, but I don't think it's required. What ever happened to people just making art for the beauty of it? You put a urinal in a museum and of course it has a \"meaning\" behind it and a message it's trying to get across. But what about a simple painting or picture of a mountain valley? The depth, the crisp lines, the intersecting shades of colors, not all intertwining because there's a story about how their interactions create a tale, but coming together to be pleasing to the eye.

That was your inspiration. You saw the tattoo, liked it, and got it. Something compelled you to get the tattoo. With the gumball artist -- something *inspired* them to start creating art even if the art itself has no meaning.
