You're helping them let go.\n\nThe problem is that your dog refuses to let go. You need them, there they are. Always. And not just when you need them, but when you're on the computer, or sitting on the couch. Your dog is there, because that's what they do.\n\nDogs don't know how to ask to be let go: It's not in a dog's nature to leave a man behind, so to speak. You gotta be the one to tell them it's okay, and you're not leaving.\n\nYou don't put them down. You pay them back for all the love they've given you.\n\nSo for all those of you who are going to go through this soon, just do me a favour, if you're making that trip to the vet's: Hold your dog's paw when he's gotta go.

Other than some injuries, and the death of our bus driver, everyone else on the bus was fine in the long run (the driver of the other bus who fell asleep behind the wheel lost both of his legs). My mother disliked my father because he was an alcoholic. She remarried and never really taught me anything about him. When I visited my grandmother in Brasil as a 23 year old man, I asked about him. She showed me a room in her shed with a whole bunch of his belongings, which she would later give to me. I treasure those soooooooooooooooooo much. I used his old beat up wallet for the better part of 5 years even though it was falling apart (it's in a storage container now as I don't want it to disintegrate on me). I just wanted to be close to something that was close to him.

Every few minutes he'd stop short to catch his breath and then the turd necklace would pelt him repeatedly in the backside, which scared him senseless and off he went running and screaming all over again. He'd make sharp turns and the turd necklace would whip around and smack him in the face. (Can you imagine the indignity of being slapped across the face with your own feces?) So after damn near 20 minutes of this chaos, he nearly collapsed from exhaustion. At that point I got some tissue, pinned him down, grabbed the turd necklace, gave it a good yank and *POP* it came out of his butt. Turns out there was a huge turdball on the end that was stuck inside of him. I later noticed there was a minefield of litter and poop surrounding his litter box. I can only guess he spotted the loooooong string in the box while passing it, then got freaked and bolted mid-#2. (sigh)...This was when he was maybe a year old, he lived to be nearly 16.

They say cats have a special enzyme of some sort in their saliva that works like new, improved Wisk - dislodging the dirt where it hides and whisking it away.\n\nI've spent most of my life believing this folklore. Like most blind believers, I've been able to discount all the facts to the contrary - the kitty odors that lurk in the corners of the garage and dirt smudges that cling to the throw rug by the fireplace.\n\nThe time comes, however, when a man must face reality; when he must look squarely in the face of massive public sentiment to the contrary and announce: \"This cat smells like a port-a-potty on a hot day in Juarez.\"\n\nWhen that day arrives at your house, as it has in mine, I have some advice you might consider as you place your feline friend under you arm and head for the bathtub:\n\n- Know that although the cat has the advantage of quickness and lack of concern for human life, you have the advantage of strength. Capitalize on that advantage by selecting the battlefield. Don't try to bathe him in an open area where he can force you to chase him. Pick a very small bathroom. If your bathroom is more than four feet square, I recommend that you get in the tub with the cat and close the sliding-glass doors as if you were about to take a shower. (A simple shower curtain will not do. A berserk cat can shred a three-ply rubber shower curtain quicker than a politician can shift positions.)\n\n- Know that a cat has claws and will not hesitate to remove all the skin from your body. Your advantage here is that you are smart and know how to dress to protect yourself. I recommend canvas overalls tucked into high-top construction boots, a pair of steel-mesh gloves, an army helmet, a hockey face mask and a long-sleeve flak jacket.\n\n- Prepare everything in advance. There is no time to go out for a towel when you have a cat digging a hole in your flak jacket. Draw the water. Make sure the bottle of kitty shampoo is inside the glass enclosure. Make sure the towel can be reached, even if you are lying on your back in the water.\n\n- Use the element of surprise. Pick up your cat nonchalantly, as if to simply carry him to his supper dish. (Cats will not usually notice your strange attire. They have little or no interest in fashion as a rule. If he does notice your garb, calmly explain that you are taking part in a product- testing experiment for J.C. Penney.)\n\n- Once you are inside the bathroom, speed is essential to survival. In a single liquid motion, shut the bathroom door, step into the tub enclosure, slide the glass door shut, dip the cat in the water and squirt him with shampoo. You have begun one of the wildest 45 seconds of your life. Cats have no handles.\n\n    Add the fact that he now has soapy fur, and the problem is radically compounded. Do not expect to hold on to him for more that two or three seconds at a time. When you have him, however, you must remember to give him another squirt of shampoo and rub like crazy. He'll then spring free and fall back into the water, thereby rinsing himself off. (The national record is - for cats - three latherings, so don't expect too much.)\n\n- Next, the cat must be dried. Novice cat bathers always assume this part will be the most difficult, for humans generally are worn out at this point and the cat is just getting really determined. In fact, the drying is simple compared to what you have just been through. That's because by now the cat is semipermanently affixed to your right leg. You simply pop the drain plug with your foot, reach for your towel and wait. (Occasionally, however, the cat will end up clinging to the top of your army helmet. If this happens, the best thing you can do is to shake him loose and to encourage him toward your leg.) After all the water is drained from the tub, it is a simple matter to just reach down and dry the cat.\n\nIn a few days the cat will relax enough to be removed from your leg. He will usually have nothing to say for about three weeks and will spend a lot of time sitting with his back to you. He might even become psychoceramic and develop the fixed stare of a plaster figurine.\n\nYou will be tempted to assume he is angry. This isn't usually the case.

Like he will not leave me alone, follows me everywhere, freaks the fuck out when I come home. He's not the smartest but he doesn't get into trouble *ever*. He chases his tail, sleeps on my face, purrs nonstop. He loves new people, and if there's more than one person in the house he'll go back and forth nonstop trying to pick a lap to purr in. My favorite is when I come home from work and he gives me actual hugs around my neck when I pick him up, and gets all nuzzly in my neck.

She knew when I was about to get up. She learned quickly what the sound of the carrier sounded like. And also to avoid anything that only had one exit (she was a very fearful cat and motivated by fear. But she learned quickly anything that was scary and how to avoid it).  She also knew when jumping and I wasn't wearing pants to be very gentle with the claws (I yelped once and it scared her so she tried to make sure I didn't make loud yelpy noise again and correctly attributed it to her claws being out).\n\nMy maine coon knows when I'm about to leave the house and kick her out of my room (she gets sneaky and will see me start to prepare and go try to sneak into my closet cause she knows I might forget and lock her in the room). She knows we won't let her on the table when we are eating on it (but she can sit at a chair and watch and maybe she'll get scraps). She knows the word \"treat\". She knows when I'm about to wake up (she doesn't wake me up but when I'm waking up she gets active and moves up from the foot of my bed to sleep on my face. Hell, I've woken up and stayed still in my bed and she'll know I'm up). She knows how the doorknob works from watching us but can't get enough grip to turn it. I am betting I could have taught her how to flush the toilet (she was very interested in the water going down) but my husband warned me, \"Do you really want to encourage her to do that?\". She also was very jealous of the siamese (when the siamese was alive, she died earlier this year :(. Hence why I have two new idiot kittens). When the maine coon was a kitten she realized if she climbed the drapes I would yell and this would scare the siamese... so she woudl climb the drapes if the saimese was on my lap to get the siamese chased off. Yeah my Maine Coone is kinda devious ;).\n\nNo, cats don't train well, they're not motivated to please. But they do learn well (There's a difference between being trainable and learning). You just have to know what incentives will get them to do stuff (for my siamese it was easy, just scare her and she'd avoid it).\n\n(unfortunately with these kittens who are littermates btw, they don't tend to link cause and causation and are stubbern so even when they get an inkling of it they do it anyways half the time. I swear, I wish they'd at least either be smarter so they'd learn to avoid when I get annoyed like at least don't jump on the kitchen counter when I'm right there! or less stubbern.
