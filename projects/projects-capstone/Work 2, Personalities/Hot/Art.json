He's described as relentlessly itching scabs off and being covered in scabs.\n\nInferno, Canto 29, lines 79-84\n>...as they assailed themselves with clawing nails--their itching had such force and fury, and there was no other help. And so their nails kept scraping off the scabs, just as a knife scrapes off the scales of carp or of another fish with scales more large.\n\nSchicchi is in the second group of the tenth pouch: counterfeiters of others' person.\n\nInferno, Canto 30, lines 25-33\n> ...two shades I saw, both pale and naked, who, biting, ran berserk in just the way a hog does when it's let loose from its sty. **The one came at Capocchio and sank his tusks into his neck** so that, by dragging, he made the hard ground scrape against his belly. And he who stayed behine, the Aretine, trambled and said: **\"That pahntom's Gianni Schicchi, and he goes raging, rending others so.\"**\n\nBolded by me for the relevant bit to the painting.\n\nReally beautiful painting, but Capocchio's skin is a little too clean, contrary to the source material.\n\nEDIT: Those line numbers come from my copy.

Just 'cause I'm on a roll (and feel free to ignore this comment, but I'm a nerd and I like this stuff) I find it interesting that the whole idiom of 'when hell freezes over' exists since the ninth circle of hell was a desolate, frozen wasteland in Dante's rendition.\n\nInferno, Canto 31:\n>Passage to the Ninth Circle. The central pit or well of Hell, where Cocytus, the last river of Hell, freezes.\n\n\\\n>The Ninth Circle, First Ring, called Caina, where Traitors to their Kin are immersed in the ice, heads bent down. (...) The Second Ring, called Antenora: the Traitors to their Homeland or Party.\n\n\\\n>The Third Ring, Ptolemea, where Traitors against their Guests jut out from ice, their eyes sealed by frozen tears.\n\n\\\n>The Ninth Circle, Fourth Ring, called Judecca, where Traitors against their Benefactors are fully covered by ice. Dis, or Lucifer, emperor of that kingdom, his three mouths rending Judas, Brutus, and Cassius. Descent of Virgil and Dante down Lucifer's body to the other, southern hemisphere. Their vision of the stars.\n\nThat last quote is the last chapter in Inferno before they move on to Purgatory (Purgatorio). Really cool stuff.

I eventually grew up and read it because I was sick of looking at it, and I liked it. Also took an art history class my first year of college, lots of pieces of work are tied together in some way. Neat stuff. To be honest again I didn't recognize the characters from the painting, but I looked it up and remembered the scene. The last few chapters of Inferno are pretty neat.

You return to the house, reality is really bending in on itself now as the holes expand to the point of merging, accelerating the expansion process and propagating the errors further. You upload the snippets to the OneCloud via your headsource, then pull out your mind pin in order to move up one dimension and instantiate all code objects. From here you can insert the snippets being careful to parse all relevant variables between associated functions. Autocompile completes with 98% absorption rate, \"that'll do\" you think, as you reinsert the mind pin and move back into the magical world. The room is back to normal, no more informational voids, just a couple of cracks from the 2% of incomplete absorption. They'll fade in time as the underlying code adapts and reconfigures over time.

The viewer asks \"Okay, she is missing a leg, what is the reason for the hope within that?\" and then every idea of the hope becomes encapsulated within that missing leg. One crutch is leaning against the window to make the subject larger and really drive in the fact that she is missing a leg and that is in fact an unmistakable crutch. This is a deliberate action by the artist.\n\nThe artist obviously wants to elicit compassion and empathy from the viewer, but to use the same tactic as a humane society ad that features a 3 legged dog trying to get by to receive donations is uncreative in my opinion.
