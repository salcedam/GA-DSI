So the complementary ad looks like its meant to appeal to business people who can afford luxury watches, with the typical \"executive\" profile. \n\nI'm certain there was more thought put into designing the dummy ad than \"We just needed something that looked like a regular ad.\" Your own explanation seems contradictory. Why not run the dummy ad as anything else (a backpacking hiker cresting a ridge, reaching over toward the laptop because he wants that more than the beautiful natural landscape he's surrounded by, or a racing driver, or a pastry chef, or anything else). They're still using the imagery of the watch-obsessed executive to stick in your mind when you're considering your purchase when the time comes, just as much as the \"light and thin\" components.\n\nEvery design decision, every component of the ad design, should be integral to the overall message of the advertisement, whether it's direct or indirect advertising.", "id": "daqkwx7"}, {"comment": "I should have thrown a \"not necessarily\" in there.

Alrighty, here we go :)  Instructions for desktop because honestly I don't use Reddit mobile\n\n1. Take the picture :D  \n2. Get the picture onto the computer.  If you used a regular camera, you probably know how.  If you used a phone, transferring files might be as easy as hooking up a cable or connecting via bluetooth, but push comes to shove: just e-mail it to yourself.  \n3. Go to an image sharing site.  http://imgur.com/ is pretty popular and reliable.  \n4. On that site there should be an option to upload.  On imgur it's called \"New post\" these days and you can find it at the top of the page.  \n5. Follow the instructions the site gives you.  In imgur's case, you can either browse for the picture on your computer, or you can drag and drop it from your computer to the browser screen.  \n6. Once the image has been uploaded, the site should give you a link for sharing the image with other people.  Copy that link.  \n7. Edit your post, or post a second reply, and paste the link.\n\nJust to note: you can't actually put the images themselves in comments, just link to them - so people typically have to click the link to see the image.  New *posts* to reddit can have an image embedded, but that's more of an automatic thing that reddit does when you submit a link to an image.\n\nSeems like a lot of steps, but after you've done it once, you'll see that it's really pretty simple.

Roof material was metal. Gable style roof. The southwest facing portion of the roof which is much less steep and heavily shaded by trees did not slide.\n\n#Weather Summary\n\nThe area received above average snowfall during the 2009-2010 accumulation season(see Snowpack Summary). Between March 10 and March 18 the Grayback SNOTEL site received 1.1 inches of precipitation.\n\n#Snowpack Summary\n\nIt has been a snowy winter in the local area. The nearby snowpack is about 1m deep with the lower half cohesionless faceted grains. At the nearby Upper Rio Grande SNOTEL site, snowpack water content is 152% of average (the highest percentage in the state) and accumulated precipitation is 107% of average. The local weather has transitioned to spring-like conditions with warmer temps in the last two weeks.\n\n#Events Leading to the Avalanche\n\nBoth persons were below the roof with shovels when the accident occurred. There were no witnesses.\n\n#Accident Summary\n\nThere were not witnesses to this accident.\n\n#Rescue Summary\n\nFirst rescuers (2) arrived in the dark and had to hike in on an unplowed driveway about 150 yds. Initial rescuers inspected home and property for signs of missing persons. At the time it was not known that a roof avalanche was the problem. Third rescuer located subject 1 with spot probe almost immediately upon arrival near the north end of the deck. Subject 2 was located shortly thereafter about 10' away toward the south end of the deck.\n\n#Comments\n\nThere are no witnesses to the accident. This description is based on observations of rescuers, and the best guess of the investigators. Two people went to inspect a summer home. They intended to do some snow removal around the home and carried large scoop shovels. The house has a northeast facing deck that looks over the Rio Grande River. The roof does not extend over the deck. They circled the house and were walking on snow piled on the deck (depth above the short deck railing) when the entire northeast facing roof released. They most likely had little time to react to the avalanche. The edge of the roof was 1 to 2 feet away from them and a little above waist high. They either leapt for safety off the deck or were immediately knocked off the deck and both buried prone with their heads downhill in the direction of the avalanche flow. They were not carried downhill in the avalanche flow. They were buried where they fell or leapt off the deck."], [9, "this is full on interesting. full on."], [8, "also known as a frozen rainbow!

Roof material was metal. Gable style roof. The southwest facing portion of the roof which is much less steep and heavily shaded by trees did not slide.\n\n#Weather Summary\n\nThe area received above average snowfall during the 2009-2010 accumulation season(see Snowpack Summary). Between March 10 and March 18 the Grayback SNOTEL site received 1.1 inches of precipitation.\n\n#Snowpack Summary\n\nIt has been a snowy winter in the local area. The nearby snowpack is about 1m deep with the lower half cohesionless faceted grains. At the nearby Upper Rio Grande SNOTEL site, snowpack water content is 152% of average (the highest percentage in the state) and accumulated precipitation is 107% of average. The local weather has transitioned to spring-like conditions with warmer temps in the last two weeks.\n\n#Events Leading to the Avalanche\n\nBoth persons were below the roof with shovels when the accident occurred. There were no witnesses.\n\n#Accident Summary\n\nThere were not witnesses to this accident.\n\n#Rescue Summary\n\nFirst rescuers (2) arrived in the dark and had to hike in on an unplowed driveway about 150 yds. Initial rescuers inspected home and property for signs of missing persons. At the time it was not known that a roof avalanche was the problem. Third rescuer located subject 1 with spot probe almost immediately upon arrival near the north end of the deck. Subject 2 was located shortly thereafter about 10' away toward the south end of the deck.\n\n#Comments\n\nThere are no witnesses to the accident. This description is based on observations of rescuers, and the best guess of the investigators. Two people went to inspect a summer home. They intended to do some snow removal around the home and carried large scoop shovels. The house has a northeast facing deck that looks over the Rio Grande River. The roof does not extend over the deck. They circled the house and were walking on snow piled on the deck (depth above the short deck railing) when the entire northeast facing roof released. They most likely had little time to react to the avalanche. The edge of the roof was 1 to 2 feet away from them and a little above waist high. They either leapt for safety off the deck or were immediately knocked off the deck and both buried prone with their heads downhill in the direction of the avalanche flow. They were not carried downhill in the avalanche flow. They were buried where they fell or leapt off the deck.", "id": "daptgl2"}], [{"comment": "this is full on interesting. full on.", "id": "dapmpwp"}], [{"comment": "also known as a frozen rainbow!

He was pretty new, fresh out of college, and was trying to prove to a big paper that he would be the best online voice for their business. \n\nThe paper laughed at him. He was, of course, too new to be taken seriously. So many places considered branching out to the Internet to be a bad move. Soil the name of the media and journalism. \n\nWell, Al was going to prove them wrong. He started a website for himself, fashioning it into a faux Newspaper look. He titled his online journal as simply \"Social Media\", patting himself on the back for such a clever name. \n\nWell, now it was time to get his first big story. There was a rumored drug ring that worked in the abandoned warehouse district. When dark had fallen and was good and solid, Al set out to get the scoop!\n\nOnly, Al never came back. \n\nThere was a search for him. Thankfully, he had posted on his site where  his story was taking him. They searched the warehouses high and low. \n\nIt wasn't until they asked his sister to go through his website to see if she could find any clues, that it was clear something was wrong.\n\n\"This isn't Al's site.\" She huffed, indignantly, her puffy eyes again filling with tears.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Asked a bewildered officer, leaning in to take a look over her shoulder.\n\n\"Al's site is called Social Media.\" \n\nThe officer followed her gaze to the stop, where it said, very clearly, **Ghostal Media**.\n\nCurious, the officer signalled to scroll to an article that seemed to have been recently posted. The date was set two days from now.\n\n**Officer Goes Missing While Investigating a Missing Person**\n\nStomach dropping a bit with unease, Officer Sherman took the mouse from Al's sister, and pulled the article  up fully.\n\nThere was a picture of him, the one beside the flag, in his uniform. \n\nA sudden panic came over Officer Sherman, and he notified the higher ups. \n\nHe was put on protective detail and paid leave. The station was taking the article as a threat. \n\nAt 11 pm, two days after they found the article, Officer Sherman got out of bed, leaving his bewildered wife. He grabbed his gun, walked down to the cruiser parked at the curb of his house, and shot both cops. \n\nFrom there, in his pajamas, he walks down the street. CCTV caught him multiple times shuffling towards the warehouse district. His eyes glazed, mouth slightly agape. A stagger in his step, one you might see in someone heavily drugged. The very last camera that captured him saw him disappearing into the same warehouse as Al. \n\nOfficer Sherman wasn't the first victims of Ghostal Media. Every few weeks, a new article would be posted, with a new local person. Every time, despite efforts by the authorities, the person would go missing.\n\nThey tried to take it down. But every time, it would just pop right back up the next day. \n\nThe thing is, it only takes those who have read it. Which seems easy enough to avoid. But there were reports of locals getting redirected to the site through completely unconnected links.\n\nIt's still out there. Today. Be careful when you click a link. Cause, there's always that tiny chance...\n\nYou might be in the next article of Ghostal Media.", "id": "darca13"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "dara2ir"}, {"comment": "http://gph.is/145KRvt", "id": "darb5zk"}], [{"comment": "Pickle them.

Ever since I was a little kid. One of the earliest photos of me is me sitting on my highchair, stuffin'' a mass of red-stained noodles into my mouth.\n\nSo when I heard about this thing called Magic Noodle from an ad on YouTube, of course I was curious. The ad seemed beyond ridiculous. \"Buy one strand of our Magic Noodle, stuff it in the microwave in a bowl of water and have a full bowl of fresh spaghetti and meatballs ^^^^'meatballs?!' within a minute!\"\n\nSo, skeptical as ever, I plopped my fat ass in my car and took a trip to the nearest supermarket. If this Magic Noodle thing really worked, it would save me so much time with dinners. You know, time better spent doing absolutely nothing.\n\nI find a display of Magic Noodle shit right in the very front of the store, soon as I walk in. It looks just like a box of regular spaghetti noodles. Though they seemed to hace dark grains in the noodle. Shrugging, already figuring this was a waste of $5, I grabbed a box and bought it. \n\nSo I get home, right? And I open the box. The noodles are thicker, and they look like they have ridges on 'em. Their a bit orange, yeah, with those weird dark grainy bits. \n\nI fill up a bowl with the Magic Noodle recommended amount of water. Pluck out one of the twelve noodles, break it in half, and drop it in.\n\nMouth screwed up into a disbelieving pucker, I choose the 1 minute quick hit button.\n\nI waited 60 seconds, go figure, right by the microwave. Unfortunately, I couldn't see through that damn tinted screen, as it was too grimy to begin with. After the *ping!* of the microwave, I slam the door open.\n\nA bowl of perfect fucking looking spaghetti is sitting, steaming, in my microwave.\n\nHo shit!\n\nEcstatic, I have my dinner, then go about my day like normal.\n\nIt didn't start getting weird til the day after the next. As impressed as I was with Magic Noodle's magic noodles, I didn't want to eat spaghetti for dinner twice. So, I had what I call the shitty-as-fuck-burger-between-two-bread-slices burger. Blech. \n\nThe next morning, my alarm wakes me up rather rudely, in the middle of a dream. Eyes still heavy from sleep, I roll and sit up on the side of the bed.\n\nImmediately, my foot lands in something squishy.\n\nI have a cat, so my first thought was vomit. But, as soon as I looked down, my heart leapt and took cover behind my Adam's apple. \n\nMy foot was sitting in a warm, delicious, plate of spaghetti. Freshly made.\n\nSo. I live alone. And, this fucking terrified me. Who the fuck makes spaghetti in a stranger's house and puts it by the side of their bed? I spent the morning calling the authorities, after tossing the spaghetti in the trash.\n\nThey laughed so much between themselves about a rogue plate of spaghetti that I doubt they realized when I hung up the phone. \n\nOut of curiosity, I checked the Magic Noodle box. There were only ten noodles left, in the box of twelve. So, at least I knew where the spaghetti came from!\n\nThat night, the thought of spaghetti made me uneasy, so I decided to have soup and goldfish for dinner. Chicken noodle, if you're wondering. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I rolled over and peered over the edge of the bed. A great sigh of relief breathed from me as I saw absolutely no plate of spaghetti. Thank goodness. \n\nWith a jovial leap from bed, I practically skipped to the shower. Hung my robe up on the doorknob, and twisted the shower on. Pretty sure I was either whistling or wailing the song \"I Will Survive\". \n\nWhen I expected water to come out, I was met with absolutely nothing. The pipes gave a groan, a creak announcing its valiant attempts. I stepped in after a couple seconds and strained to get a look at the shower nozzle, to see if any mold grew to plug the holes. It looked completely clear.\n\nIt was as I had my face an inch from the nozzle that the pipes gave a magnificent groan, and with a splat, noodles came shooting out of the tiny holes. A spray of red sauce coated my face as the shower nozzle shook. Tension grew in the wall, the creaking of the pipes growing to screeching levels. \n\nSwiping sauce and noodles from my face, I quickly jumped from the shower, right as there was a satisfying *shhnk* and the shower nozzle exploded off of the wall. It clattered to the bottom of the tub after colliding with the opposite wall, knocking free a dusty chunk of plaster.\n\nImmediately as the shower nozzle launched forward, spaghetti noodles and sauce fell from the pipe heavily plopping into the tub below.\n\nRed splattered the walls as meatballs fell, one by one, into the tub. After a bit, water started pouring from the spout, bringing the rest of the noodles and sauce.\n\nUh.\n\nI was confused, to say the least. Didn't quite know what to do at that moment, staring at a pile of steaming spaghetti noodles in the middle of my tub. Figured if I called the cops, I'd get laughed at again, so I just cleaned up the mess after turning off the shower.\n\nI checked the Magic Noodle box as soon as I got downstairs to the kitchen. Sure enough, another was missing.\n\nI took it to the store to return, that day. Just was going to tell them that this particular box was a little \"off.\" But the clerk said they didn't sell any brand named Magic Noodle. And when I told her what it was, she just quirked a brow at me. \n\nThat night, when I got home, I tossed the Magic Noodle box. Right into the dumpster at the end of my street. \n\nThe next day, there was spaghetti in my cereal, and the box was sitting (unscathed) in the pantry.\n\nDeciding I didn't want to play eight days of \"find the spaghetti\" I had one of the noodles for dinner (it was closed when in the trash), hoping against hope I would avoid another spaghetti bomb. \n\nLike I had hoped, I woke up the next day, and was spaghetti free! I went to work feeling happier, and lighter, though a part of me worried that somewhere within my house was a hidden pile of noodles.\n\nAfter work, we all went out for beers. I got a burger and fries and more than a few beers. Not being able to drive, I stayed the night with my coworker, crashing on his couch. \n\nThe next morning, I barely stopped by the house to grab my work clothes, having already showered at Mike's. Despite having a long night the night before, this day dragged on till I was two hours late getting home.\n\nMagic Noodle was far from my mind as I heated up a pizza and ate it in bed.  I fell asleep with the plate on my chest.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was certain I had fallen asleep in the bath. I was submerged in something wet, and warm.\n\nI opened my eyes, and was pretty sure I was still dreaming.\n\nThe entire bed was covered in spaghetti. I was buried beneath it, like a noodle castle. There had to have been at least four plates worth! Sauce was splattered all over the ground as I rolled to grab my phone. I wasn't going to avoid calling the cops this time.\n\nThey came and took a statement, took a picture of the spaghetti in the bed, the broken shower nozzle, and the stains of red sauce on the wall. All while smirking at each other. Pretty much all they did, though. There was no sign of forced entry, or fingerprints. Ugh. Frustrating.\n\nThey suggested I put up cameras.\n\nSo I did! I put one in my bathroom, office, living room, kitchen, dining room, and bedroom. Basically every room but the closet.\n\nThat night, I cheerily ate a can of Spaghetti-Os in front of the Magic Noodle box. \n\nThe next morning I woke up and gingerly made my way out of the bed. No spaghetti yet. I tip toed my way to the office, where I could check the cameras on my computer. \n\nI pulled out the chair from my computer desk and made to sit ... *found it*. That damn fucking spaghetti. There was a fucking plate of it! Just ... just sitting on my computer chair, waiting for me!\n\nWhen I checked the cameras, kneeling in front of the desk, I couldn't say I was surprised when I saw a noodle slowly wriggle it's way out of the top of the Magic Noodle box. It shimmered, then disappeared.\n\nWithin two seconds, a fully made plate of spaghetti appeared on my office chair. As I was watching, an error from the video recording popped up. Before I could even react, all of the files disappeared, the computer screen going blank.\n\nThat night, I made the last two noodles, and fed them to my ex-wife and her new husband in an impromptu \"makeup\" dinner. It was quite satisfying seeing her wolf down that cursed plate of slimy noodles.\n\nMe? I didn't have any spaghetti. In fact, I think I've lost the taste for it.\n\nFuck Magic Noodle.", "id": "daractn"}, {"comment": "What the fuck ", "id": "daraw6a"}, {"comment": "Check the username.", "id": "daraxtv"}, {"comment": "OK?", "id": "darao4l"}, {"comment": "You should check usernames before commenting", "id": "darb03h"}, {"comment": "This is definitely not potato product.", "id": "dar894y"}], [{"comment": "/r/mildlyreposting", "id": "dar8g7j"}], [{"comment": "I can't believe no one has ever done this before.

It goes into a holding area in the terminal and is sent in batches to the credit processor.

Cost optimization isn't a factor, outside of a few rare edge cases.\n\nAn RFID reader alone won't do anything useful with a contactless card, since it's an online transaction using cryptographic signatures of datagrams originating from the issuing banks. It is *not* just \"card number over wireless\" - it's a bunch of realtime communication over the networks between several devices/companies.

I work in the payments industry.\n\nSo a few things.\n\nThe vast majority of cops have no special training in payment systems, or small time fraud methods.  All they do is take a statement from someone that a charge is no legitimate, and write that down in a report.  Unless the fraud was large, they do not investigate.  If the fraud is large, there are specialty cops to investigate.  Your friends are either leading you on, making up stuff to sound cool, or imaginary.  Here's why:\n\nYou can't just willy-nilly get a functioning card reader, with a working merchant account.  You need to provide business details, a physical address, tax ID, etc.  When CC fraud does occur, it is frequently the bank that ends up eating the cost, so they try to prevent fraudsters from having access to working payment terminals.\n\nIf someone did setup a scam business, in some way that was not traceable back to them (including a way of collecting the money anonymously), their merchant account would get shut down within hours or days of the first use, as soon as several \"customers\" disputed the charge.  Many cards now offer text messages every time you use it, especially for payment types like contactless, or other suspicious activity.  If a new merchant has a larger percentage then average chargebacks on their first few days of business, their account will be investigated, and the money won't pay out.  Merchant's don't get the money immediately like a paypal transfer - the payments are batched and generally pay out within a couple of days.  Plenty of time for a few chargebacks to trigger an investigation.\n\nThere were some media reports over the past few years about it, and while it is *technically* possible, the risk and cost vs reward make it a bad scheme.

And most criminals get away because it's hard to catch.\n\nThe chip is different because it's not just something with your account number on it; it's a small computer, much like a sim card, that has a \"conversation\" using encryption with the card reader. Each transaction \"conversation\" uses unique numbers each time, so it is much more difficult for someone to duplicate your card and spend your money. Europe has had chip-and-pin instead of swiping for decades now, and has much less credit card fraud than the US. In fact, [we have the least secure payment system in the world](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/us-determined-to-have-the-least-secure-credit-cards-in-the-world/473199/) and bring down everyone else's security with it because we mandate swipe strips on cards.", "id": "dapq9b5"}, {"comment": "European, been using chips for years. There is pretty much no difference in how its used as opposed to a swipe.\n\nInstead of swiping you insert it into a reader like a video game cartridge and instead of a signature you the give the machine your pin.\n\nChips are hard to duplicate, and you can't fake a pin the way you can a signature, since you have to, well, actually know it. Unlike a signature, which has the name you need to write right there on the card. (The signatures do nothing nowadays).\n\n\nContactless payment is becoming normal here too, and I recently got my first card that supports it. I just hold my wallet up to the reader for a split second and I'm done, no need to take out the card in the first place, it gets read wirelessly through the fabric.
