It just wouldn't have been \"right\". Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you.\nYou're an idiot. A moron of the highest order. You're so stupid it's a wonder and a pity you can remember to breath. Intelligent ideas bounce off your head as if it were coated with teflon. Creative thoughts take alternate transportation in order to avoid even being in the same state as you. If you had an original thought it would die of loneliness before the hour was out. On an intelligence scale of 1 to 10 (10 corresponding to the highest attainable IQ) you're rating is so far into negative numbers that one would need to travel into another quantum reality in order to even catch a distant glimpse of it.\nYour personality is that of a rabid Chihuahua intent on destroying its own tail. Your powers of observation are akin to those of the bird that keeps slamming into the picture window trying to get that other bird it keeps seeing. You are walking, talking proof that you don't have to be sentient to survive, and that Barnum was thinking of you when he uttered his immortal phrase regarding the birth of a sucker. You are, at varying times, tedious, boring, and even occasionally earth shatteringly hilarious in your idiocy, routinely childish, moronic, pathetic, wretched, disgusting and pitiful.\nYou are wholly without any redeeming social grace or value. If God ever decides to give the planet an enema you'd better run like the wind because anywhere you stand is a suitable place for The Insertion. There is no animal so disgusting, so vile that it deserves comparison to you, for even the lowest, dirtiest, most parasitic member of the animal kingdom fills an ecological niche. You fill no niche. To call you a parasite would be injurious and defamatory to the thousands of honest parasitic species. You are worse than vermin, for vermin do not pretend to be what it is not. You are truly human garbage. You are a fraudulent, lying, predatory charlatan. You are of less worth than a burnt-out light bulb. You will forever live in shame.\nYou have nothing to say, and Godwin's Law does not apply when writing about you. You are the anti-Midas, for all that you touch becomes valueless and unusable. Mothers gather their children close when you appear. You are an aberration, a corruption, and a boil that needs to be lanced. You are a poison in need of being vomited. You are a tooth so rotten it infects the whole body. You are sperm that should have been captured in a condom and flushed down a toilet.\nI don't like you. I don't like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do. Go away, you swine. You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon. You are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. Meaningful to no one, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts that sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.\nI will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I wretch at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, and the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell? Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot. You are a waste of flesh. On a good day you're a halfwit. You are deficient in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.\nYou are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate, noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away. I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. The only thing worse than your logic is your manners.

They were property. But the insurance company refused to pay so it was taken to court. The court made the ruling(Gregson v Gilbert) it was okay to kill slaves in some circumstances and insurance companies would have to pay, BUT this time it was not okay cause it was the captain and crew's fault for problem, so they recieved no money.\n\nThis case really sparked some anti-slavery movements though and helped push the case of ending the slave trade for the British too.

The clue that linked the case to the TV series: six or seven white balloons were found entangled in a cholla cactus, some 30 feet from the body.\n> \n> \"We're not saying it's a copycat of the TV show,\" New Mexico state police Lt. Rick Anglada said. \"We have no way to know he actually saw the episode. However, the lead agent kept hearing from people that there was a similar case from 'CSI.\"'\n> \n> So the detective rented the show and took notes.\n> \n> \"There were similarities in the episode, where a character did tie helium balloons to a gun and hoped it would float away,\" Anglada said.\n> \n> Medical investigators ruled the death a suicide, Anglada said, and additional evidence led detectives to conclude the scene was a ruse intended to look like a homicide.\n> \n> The handgun's grips had been removed and the trigger guard was sawed off, an apparent attempt to lighten the weapon. Anglada said investigators searched the garage of Hickman's home in Texas and found matching metal shavings.\n> \n> Only a single spent shell casing remained in the chamber, Anglada said, and there was no evidence the 6-foot-6, 260-pound Hickman, a regional manager for Red Lobster restaurants, had resisted his death.\n> \n> \"There were no signs of a struggle, and he was a large man, not bound in any way,\" Anglada said.\n> \n> Investigators believe Hickman filled the balloons with helium, tied the balloon bouquet to the weapon, then duct-taped his own mouth and shot himself in the back of the head.\n> \n> They also found he held a life insurance policy that would pay his wife $388,000 or double that amount if his death was accidental.\n> \n> Hickman was last seen at a business meeting in Abilene, Texas, on March 13.

And the fact is this, even in the LGBT community lesbians and gays think bi people are attention whores and is not a real sexuality. So this 3% is going to fluctuate for years until people feel no need to hide it and until we can get a definitive answer on what trans people and bi people are(I think bi people are just like gays and lesbians, but most people disagree).\n\nAs for the women being attracted to other women, women are much more open to the idea of noticing beauty and good looks in women, but in no way would they wanna sleep with them.

It is not a joke, and the other guy has it basically right. Simplified summary is, basically: no government whatsoever, libertarianism taken to the extreme. Private roads, private security forces, private arbitration etc. Free market produces best outcomes for *everything*, argue its proponents. Based around the NAP (non-aggression principle), or the idea that you should never aggress upon another, whether in the form of physical violence, coercive threat, or infringing upon their property rights. They hold that any form of \"statism\" whatsoever is based on unjust coercion (for example, if you don't pay taxes you will go to jail- you are, at base, coerced into parting with your property through the threat of violence upon your person, or more specifically detainment).\n\nIt's all very interesting really, and I think they sort of have a point. The best responses, however, are in my view:\n\n1. **It's not practically desirable for our most important services.** Despite their protestations, I and many others think that having law and its enforcement, fire and  rescue, and vital public infrastructure among many other things be a source of profit, with no regulation, introduces a serious conflict of interest and incentivises the wrong priorities (one of the most obvious faults here is that it seems difficult to imagine how poor people could be expected to receive the same consideration as rich, or really any consideration at all, in courts of law for example).\n\n2. **It doesn't improve accountability.** Anarcho-capitalists can and do point to the current state of many democracies as an example of how elections do not work to hold officials accountable, and that the market would more effectively promote to positions of power those who serve the people. You can sort of see the idea here; while elected representatives can promise improved health care outcomes and then fail to deliver when in office, the best hospitals in an anarcho-capitalist system would be most successful, encouraging others to provide better services and improving outcomes for all.\n\nThe problem is that many consumers do not have the information they need to evaluate their service; in the financial sector, for example, sub-prime loanees could not have known that the service provided them was woefully unsuitable for their needs and damaging to their financial prospects until it was entirely too late. Elected officials at least are *in principle* directly accountable to their constituents, and therefore must at least appear to be serving their interests. Not always ideal by a long shot, but better than essentially being ruled by those who have you entirely at their mercy without redress for the poorest, as I believe would result from an absolutely market driven economy and society.\n\n3. **The foundational concept is wrong**. Arguably none of this would matter much if the idea of the heart of Anarcho-capitalism were true. If the government is founded upon and supported by unjust, coercive practices, then perhaps any alternative is preferable. And ancaps argue exactly that; that by demanding tribute from its subjects in the form of taxation, the state violates the most important principle- of non-aggression- by its very existence. Because the involuntary redistribution of property essentially *is* the state, whether that takes the form of benefits paid in cash or communal infrastructure built using taxed wealth.\n\nI'd argue, though, that a more accurate and instructive way of viewing the state is as a sort of social contract. We give our implicit consent to be governed and taxed by our use of the services the state provides. It helps to remember that the state is not some distinct entity to the people; it is a small subset *of* the people, chosen *by* the people, to enforce our will. Not always effectively- perhaps never all that effectively- but if we so decide, we can change that, too, with our vote. \n\nViewed this way it doesn't seem so strange or unjust that the threat of violence enforces our payment of taxes. Taxes are our agreed fee for services rendered; it is not unjust that the agreed upon contribution is required, and extracted by force if necessary. After all, even an ancap would expect a shop owner to collect his payment for a good sold on credit, and for there to be consequences for the buyer should she renege on the agreement.\n\nBut yes, despite my extensive disagreements with it it is a very serious political philosophy, with plenty of academic literature in support of it. Murray Rothbard is the main man to read on the subject, but Hayek and Mises are important to its ideological underpinnings, especially the economic aspect of it.\n\nOr if you want an overview you can check out the Wikipedia page, it's got a fair amount of depth:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism\n\nSorry for the essay; my masters was in political philosophy and I have always found anarcho-capitalism a fascinating idea, perhaps because I have some sympathy with its core principles despite landing virtually at the other extreme of the spectrum in my own views.", "id": "dansahd"}, {"comment": "Nice pasta.

The point of those shows is to be \"waifu catcher\" basically. It's all about how you're supposed to obsess over these characters and which one you like.

The show doesn't need to be like super deep or anything like NGE, cause while I love NGE I'm completely fine watching a dumb show like Is the Order a Rabbit or Azumanga Daoih.\n\nBut yes, the fanbase does turn me off for the series, but the show is *intentionally* attracting fans and encouraging them to act in a manner I don't really care for.
