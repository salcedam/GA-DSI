While it's true that sometimes the computer uses disk space for virtual memory page swapping, the movies are on a 3TB external drive, while the OS is on the SSD I put in a few months back. Facebook is probably just being slow - Facebook comes from a different computer, or \"server\" (actually, Facebook uses more than one server because of how many requests they have to serve) somewhere else on the internet, and since a lot of people use it at the same time, sometimes it's not very fast. \\**brings up task manager*\\* Also, you left 100 tabs of memory-leaking flash games open again, and Firefox is currently consuming 6 of our 12 GB of RAM.

You can have an awesome 48 inch wide gas electric hybrid from Wolf or Viking, or you can have a crappy camping grill with the tiny bottle of propane, and anything in between. You can get way more shit done if you have 6 burners and 2 ovens, than if you only have 1 or 2 burners and a tiny oven.\n\nThe counter space is like your RAM. You can't take something from the fridge and throw it in the oven right away, you need to prepare it on the counter first. If you have a huge counter, you can prepare way more ingredients in advance. If you have a tiny counter, you have to do one ingredient at a time, unwrap it, cut it, put it on the stove then put it back in the fridge before you can get something else. Takes time! Also, you have small appliances ALWAYS on your counter, such as toaster or coffee machine (antivirus or skype, whatever).\n\nSo when someone asks me if deleting their photos will make the computer go faster I tell them what I said above, then I ask them this.\n\nLets's say you want to cook an omelette. You have the same kitchen except one the fridge is empty, there's nothing in there besides the ingredients you need to cook the omelette.

If you just browse around a bit, you'll find there are countless applications, documents, preference files, system files, databases and much more. And beyond the myriad of visible files there are countless more invisible ones. At any one given moment, a computer is usually running hundreds of different parallell processes. It is also constantly reading and writing little pieces of data to memory, to disk and to the network. \n\nNovice users' idea of what conserving space or bandwidth means is usually ridiculously far removed from this reality. It's always about the 10 Word documents on the desktop or the hundred or so e-mails. Always about the amounts of them and not the sizes. I guess somewhere there's a design problem since this is so common. But it baffles me more as computers become more powerful, in ways that the novice users also take advantage of. Consumer equipment can now casually be used to live-stream 4K video over the internet. It includes AI software that interprets conversational speech in real-time and analyses peoples' faces in photos. It comes with free suites for editing and organising vast amounts of high-resolution media. And that media surely takes space to store and power and bandwidth to play.

In case you are wondering how addiction works... I will make this easy to understand for the majority by using a readily available analogue.\n\nOrgasm provides the same chemical stimuli as heroin, this is because they both interact with the same receptors in the brain and produce the same effect. The high from orgasm is not as intense as heroine but it is equally addictive.\n\nIf a person told you that you had to go to a special place to give up orgasm, you would think they are a moron. Especially if they have never done it\n\nNow multiply this by 5 for the high and add the cost involved for heroin and you have yourself an idea of why it is so hard to kick the damn stuff. Because the motivator is the same sex drive that makes Timmy do the hand shandy when nobody is watching.\n\nIt get's complicated even further by resistances. As a heroine user continues regularly using the substance, it becomes less potent. The same goes for orgasm, the kick is not as strong when a person does it frequently. With Heroine being such a strong stimulant, it hits the body harder and the resistance is increased harshly to compensate.\n\nThis means the person needs a bigger dose to get the same effect but also means that sex becomes unfulfilling.\n \nResistance is prevalent in a lot of medications but in Heroine and Cocaine's instances, it can be a killer.\n\nSo how does Rehab kill our celebs?\n\nWell in this case, our heroin user has been using for 3 months and has built up some level of resistance, and they know their dose.\n\nBut... here's the kicker. \n\n**Family comes and forces rehab on them.**\n\nThey get stuck in a room, waiting for the drugs to wear off and whilst they are there, their body is becoming...\n\n#sensitized to the substance again.\n\nThey finish their rehab and live life for a while, until, just like the urge to masturbate for some, the urge strikes to take another hit and relapse.\n\nOnce that urge starts to kick in, the body starts driving the process until, they have a needle in their hand and they have an estimated dose **that they think they can take**. \n\nThe reality is, they actually can't take that hit in their hand and they OD.\n\nMost OD's we see about on the news tends to be right after rehab has been ordered on a junkie, so you might want to take a second before thinking rehab is a solution, because it might equal death if it is forced on a person.\n\nWhat tends to be more effective than rehab is a realization on the part of the sufferer that they need to make a change, but even then, it is a life long struggle with urges after they have done it.\n\nThis is why the not even once campaign started, because if you do it once, there is a very real chance you could get hooked on the good vibrations and end up losing everything you were to the person you will end up being."], [4, "Am alcoholic.

I wish more would see it. If you want to be a counselor, you should check it out.", "id": "daqezwk"}, {"comment": "Yeah you can't understand, really, without experiencing it first or second hand. I kind of liken my description of addiction to describe what it's like to be on hallucinogens to a person who's never tried them: it's nearly impossible to describe to someone who's never experienced that sensation. Or, for example, like trying to describe schizophrenia or depression to a person without mental illness. It literally won't make any sense to them. The reason is simply because a rational mind has no conception of the irrational mind. Impossible to rectify. Describing addiction in simple words just can't do it justice. It's more than just \"you're addicted to drugs and will do anything to get them\". It's a constant, pervasive feeling that is present at every moment, at every meal, at every shit and shower and shave, during intercourse and masturbation, during committed personal and familial relationships, at every job, every job interview, every school day, every funeral, every wedding, every single life event involving you or those close to you, every family function (maybe especially family functions), literally every waking and sometimes sleeping moment during which you haven't recently ingested your substance of choice. \n\nNearly every minute of your life that isn't spent on your substance is comprised of constant, incessant mental chatter devoted to thinking about or trying to obtain your substance of choice. And often even when you're on your substance, a large portion of time and energy is devoted to obtaining your next stash of substances, or ingesting your next dose of substances. And, although in no means do I wish to compare in terms of effect or context, not unlike being on hallucinogens or suffering from depression, time slows down during addiction. Every single second not spent high af to the gills on your poison of choice is nearly unbearable. Infinite. Time stretches thin, insufferable, and perceivably, dangerously slow. \n\nYou cannot describe the physical and mental anguish properly enough. There is no way to explain a constant, nagging voice in your head that is telling you to sell all your electronic devices, books, televisions, cherished personal items and family heirlooms. To do anything, ANYTHING to get your hands on the cash and connections needed to use. The need is ever present, and immediate. In need of constant cessation and suppression. There's no way to explain the headaches, the back and leg pain, the stomach issues and near constant watery shit that flows out from you like hell water. If you're addicted to booze or benzos, your withdrawal is also, literally, potentially fatal. Hard to explain seizures without epilepsy in your twenties with no other medical conditions. But most of all, it's hard to explain the fact that if you just spent as few as two or three days away from your substance, you'd begin to feel better. Not that recovery is that quick or simple, in fact it's just as hard to explain to someone not in the know that once an addict you are ALWAYS an addict. As in, FOR LIFE. Even if you're not doing your substance any longer. But if you only tough it out for just a few, short, painful and nearly unbearable days, you almost immediately begin to notice a difference, a return to normalcy and self control. You need to cut ties, and need to stay away from things that remind you of using, or were active participants in your usage, but really after about three days your physical anguish recedes considerably, albeit not entirely. And it's hard to explain that the mental anguish, the constant nagging and self manipulation, and mental gymnastics needed to convince yourself that \"what, it's been days/weeks/months/years, what's just one drink/pill/line/smoke really going to do after all this time?\" doesn't really just go away even if it's been years. Literally years, even decades. \n\nI've been out of the heavy throes of addiction for nearly seven years, and although yes I do take the occasional drug or drink or whatever, I have a level of self control that I didn't before. I can take some Percocet for some medical ailment, or even just for fun on a rainy Sunday, and see the progression back to irrationality and say \"nope, that's enough\", and stop. I'm lucky. But I'd be lying if I said that suppressing that urge to use doesn't still require very much effort and its own kind of mental gymnastics. I'd be lying if I said that i didn't still have fairly regular dreams about using, secretly using, or trying to obtain hard drugs several times a month. Because I do, I have these dreams frequently, even still, and I don't tell anyone about them, not even my wife, and why? Because it's literally impossible to explain why, after so much time, I still have dreams and cravings for something that I put behind me so long ago.", "id": "daqj7ac"}, {"comment": "Fuckin hell, this was some heavy duty shit.

At the lowest of it, I remember realizing \"I dont care what happens - whether I end up homeless, lonely, abandoned - as long as I have my substance of choice it wont matter.\" That was when I was in college, had a beautiful girlfriend, and had prospects for at minimum a middle-class life. \n\nI didn't give a shit that my organs were failing me - I was shitting gray, would wake up with a sharp pain in my heart, and cognitively I'd lose my train of thought mid-sentence. It wasn't like \"oh I forgot what I'd say next so I'll say something related.\" It was more like \"Shit what the fuck was I talking about. I dont even know the topic.\" \n\nI seriously wanted to quit probably a about a dozen times. But I'd fiend until the last milligram was gone, first scraping the inside of a baggie with a needle, then finding any burned residue from aluminium foil I recently used, then digging through the trash to find any foil I had thrown away, then doing that over and over until I realized it was gone. Sometimes I'd even search the floor to find a bit of powder/crystal that I may have dropped - I only needed 3-7mg and only a tiny morsel would put me where I needed to be.\n\nI often told myself that \"It wasn't the right time to quit.\" I had been through withdrawals before - usually it'd be a day of laying in bed in a cold sweat, a few days where time is dilated and slowed to a half, and manic mood swings that would make me come to tears laughing or a sense of doom crying. I'm not a dude who is really capable of crying normally - so that's definitely something that was odd. So I'd say \"I'll wait until the end of the semester.\" Then the demons inside said \"Wait it's winter break. You have an entire month where you can just get fucked! Do it!\" So the time I planned to get clean was moreso the time where I drastically increased usage/tolerance. \n\nThe first year I handled it like a champ. Felt invincible, invulnerable. The second year I realized it was a burden, but the benefits still outweighed the negatives. The third year I was getting exhausted - mentally, physically, and emotionally. The fourth I was a fucking psychotic mess - losing grip with reality and doing shit I normally wouldn't do (nothing criminal, just being a shitty person). \n\nHad anyone called me out during that time and tried to get me to go to rehab, I'd have probably seen it as an attack. The excuse I'd have had is: *Who is someone else to tell me how to live my life?* But deep down, I knew the reason was that I wasn't ready for the last hit I took to be **the** last. It gave me a new perspective on people I saw on Intervention saying \"I refuse to go today. I'll go tomorrow.\" It gave me a new perspective of people who say \"This is going to be my last\" and then fail. I'd have thrown a childish fucking fit had that been the case - because I wouldn't have been ready for that to be my last. \n\nThe most taunting thing about realizing you want to quit is getting stuck in the cycle of \"last hits.\" I took probably over 500-1000 lasts. It's taunting in that first when you're peaking you're perfectly content with it being your last. You're planning out your next moves. Being optimistic about sobriety. Ready to take the next steps in your life. Time is dilated, so those racing thoughts pile up and up and up creating a grand display of healing. Then, you start coming down - hard and fast. Realizing those pleasant thoughts are gone. Realizing that the hard road has begun - something you're not and never will be fully prepared for. So what do you do? Take another hit to get those pleasant thoughts back. And another. And another. Until you realize you're scraping bags and searching the carpeting for crystals again - and it's midway through a semester so you can't just enter the recovery you need. Fuck.\n\nThe funny thing is, I dont even remember when my \"last hit was.\" It just kind of happened. My drug of choice started having bad side effects due to my tolerance - it became dysphoric and I got more scared of it than I did the withdrawals. I'd freak out that my heart had stop, would hallucinate my hand turning from shades of blue to shades of yellow, would think that my circulation would cause me to lose my hand, would think my body temperature was getting dangerously low so I'd take a shower. Paranoia I suppose. \n\nSo there I was addicted to a drug that was no longer making me happy as fuck, instead making me live hell on earth. I didn't really \"have to quit\" - I was past that point - my own body/mind basically just decided to. In a way, I was lucky. I was also lucky that synth cannabinoids are pretty hard to fatally OD on. Had it been heroin, I may not \n\nThat was about 2-3 years ago. Of all the times I tried to quit, the easiest was the time I actually did. Hence why I'm a firm believer of \"You cant make a drug addict quit until they're ready.\"\n\nEDIT: Thought I'd add that I was addicted to synthetic cannabinoids - smoking the pure powder - not \"incense/k2\". Don't make the mistake of assuming it's weed or close to weed. It's not. [Here's a great video showing how serious it can get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6pmc7Tpx4w) and how serious it was for me. When I was having withdrawals, I couldn't sleep for days, was freezing cold - but would sweat a puddle 2x larger than my body.

The real kicker of it is if you're young, or not thinking rationally, you aren't able to help yourself, it's incredibly difficult for any family.\n\nSometimes it's just lack of awareness - there are a lot of parents and families out there who just aren't able to identify that their kid has a medical problem, they aren't medical professionals - they just see anti-social behaviour. The behavior is addressed, there's a lot of shouting, the root cause is never considered - the illness continues to present itself, the cycle just continues. \n\nMore worrying though, there are also many well-meaning families and friends who still have a stigma bias against mental illness. It's still a huge taboo. They think that 'doping up on pills' is a bad thing, and *if only they could get through to that person* they could correct the behavior just simply reasoning with them. (#\"My daddy thinks I'm fine\"#)\n\nInevitably, it quickly turns to frustration, resentment, relationships break down.

I also don't think we should go \"Oh, the poor flower, none of this is her fault.\". It's sad and addiction is fucking hard to deal with but you have to take responsibility for yourself. You have to notice when there's a problem, go and seek help and actually try to engage in recovery.

In case you are wondering how addiction works... I will make this easy to understand for the majority by using a readily available analogue.\n\nOrgasm provides the same chemical stimuli as heroin, this is because they both interact with the same receptors in the brain and produce the same effect. The high from orgasm is not as intense as heroine but it is equally addictive.\n\nIf a person told you that you had to go to a special place to give up orgasm, you would think they are a moron. Especially if they have never done it\n\nNow multiply this by 5 for the high and add the cost involved for heroin and you have yourself an idea of why it is so hard to kick the damn stuff. Because the motivator is the same sex drive that makes Timmy do the hand shandy when nobody is watching.\n\nIt get's complicated even further by resistances. As a heroine user continues regularly using the substance, it becomes less potent. The same goes for orgasm, the kick is not as strong when a person does it frequently. With Heroine being such a strong stimulant, it hits the body harder and the resistance is increased harshly to compensate.\n\nThis means the person needs a bigger dose to get the same effect but also means that sex becomes unfulfilling.\n \nResistance is prevalent in a lot of medications but in Heroine and Cocaine's instances, it can be a killer.\n\nSo how does Rehab kill our celebs?\n\nWell in this case, our heroin user has been using for 3 months and has built up some level of resistance, and they know their dose.\n\nBut... here's the kicker. \n\n**Family comes and forces rehab on them.**\n\nThey get stuck in a room, waiting for the drugs to wear off and whilst they are there, their body is becoming...\n\n#sensitized to the substance again.\n\nThey finish their rehab and live life for a while, until, just like the urge to masturbate for some, the urge strikes to take another hit and relapse.\n\nOnce that urge starts to kick in, the body starts driving the process until, they have a needle in their hand and they have an estimated dose **that they think they can take**. \n\nThe reality is, they actually can't take that hit in their hand and they OD.\n\nMost OD's we see about on the news tends to be right after rehab has been ordered on a junkie, so you might want to take a second before thinking rehab is a solution, because it might equal death if it is forced on a person.\n\nWhat tends to be more effective than rehab is a realization on the part of the sufferer that they need to make a change, but even then, it is a life long struggle with urges after they have done it.\n\nThis is why the not even once campaign started, because if you do it once, there is a very real chance you could get hooked on the good vibrations and end up losing everything you were to the person you will end up being.", "id": "daqhbba"}], [{"comment": "Am alcoholic.

Also it's not hard to grasp. Professors now a days keep their jobs by relying on good evaluations from the students. But hard teachers who challenge you will get bad reviews and a bad rep on sites that let students comment about that professor. Therefore you see a whole generation of kids who will seek out professors who let you use notes on the test, will post power points online so you don't have to take notes, doesn't take attendance, etc. sure some of these things are useful for a student. But some of these things also aren't used for usefulness they are used so kids don't have to challenge themselves (I did this for a couple years in college because I was working 2 jobs.) \n\nOn top of students telling everyone which professor is the easiest and most laid back professors are losing jobs left and right from those evaluations. I have since graduate and could possible teach. But the job market is so over populated that professors have a hard time finding work and keeping it. Many of the good professors get fired because they have all ones on their evaluations from students who didn't like they had to read the chapters instead of look at the power point online. So right now if you walked onto any college campus and took a class in say history you will see a professor giving out study guides with everything that will be on the test, all the notes for the test are posted online so I didn't need to pay attention and take notes. Oh and I didn't even have to be in class because she doesn't take roll. But she will keep her job because I will give her all 5's on the evaluation and tell my buddies how awesome she is for being easy. \n\nThis stuff has been scientifically studied. But I urge people to observe it for yourself. Try not to keep the mindset of being a lazy college kid trying to get out as quick as possible. Think about you being challenge then tell me if college is truly challenging you (this varies. Kids studying engineering or becoming a doctor will be challenged every day.) but my senior year of high school I had a teacher who would go through the whole test the day before (like in the meme.) I never didn't get a 100 because I knew all the answers from the day before. I was never challenged and couldn't even tell you anything I learned in that class. But that was high school. I was shocked to see some college classes are like this at state universities. And if you think this isn't a big deal just wait until you graduate with a degree but can't give the basics about the field of work you just majored in. Plus shit teachers shouldn't be rewarded for dumbing down a course. \n\nPS. Not saying you used the wrong meme or anything. I know how great that feeling is when you don't have to stress over a final. I too wish I could have the answers for any final. But I also didn't think about challenging myself until after I graduated. When you are a student you have a different mindset when it comes to test. Personally I don't even like test. Papers and essays are better ways to tell if a student is understanding the material. Plus it's funny watching people bullshit their way through an essay compared to a bubble test.

It really required us to be able to take previously learned concepts and apply them to something new. I can memorize all I want about cell bio but applying that to cancer cells and piecing together signaling pathways to potentially find new targets is not something that can be memorized. \n\nThe professor is there to push us to start becoming independent, not hold our hands.

Teachers are largely evaluated on the outcome of their students. Most teachers have some form of review before major exams. It only makes sense to review stuff that will actually be on the exams, otherwise you get students/parents/administrators who question you on why you taught them X when Y is what was on the exam.\n\nReviewing questions directly based on exam questions gives students an idea of how the exam will be structured and what content will be the main focus, which decreases any complaints from the people in charge, or the people who would otherwise complain to the people in charge.\n\nIt's not perfect, but teachers are already paid a shit salary in a career path that isn't always easy to find another job in. Schools care about grades, because that's what keeps the money rolling in. It'd be great if there were better ways of assessing understanding without sacrificing the integrity of learning, but principals and school boards aren't going to give two shits about how well your students understand the concepts if they still weren't able to ace that test while doing so.\n\nWe teach them concepts and assess that understanding still, but tests are definitely more of a \"what do you remember?\" than displaying understanding of what they remember. That's not to say tests don't work. I'm a science teacher and a large part of my tests are being able to adequately explain different processes, which requires greater level of understanding of the process. It's really hard for my students to remember a concept they don't understand.\n\nNot every subject requires a high level of understanding. For example, history classes are almost 100% about how well you remember facts. There isn't much to really understand. Maybe you have to recognize the cause and effect of various events, but at the end of the day it's mostly remembering facts.\n\nScience and Math require you to understand what you're doing. You might remember a concept, but if you can't explain it well or execute an equation properly then you don't get the points.\n\nTests are just as much about remembering as they are about understanding. Reviews for tests should be focusing on what the test will be about. If you're a teacher and you're not reviewing directly what will be on the test, then you will get a bunch of complaints.

Also it's not hard to grasp. Professors now a days keep their jobs by relying on good evaluations from the students. But hard teachers who challenge you will get bad reviews and a bad rep on sites that let students comment about that professor. Therefore you see a whole generation of kids who will seek out professors who let you use notes on the test, will post power points online so you don't have to take notes, doesn't take attendance, etc. sure some of these things are useful for a student. But some of these things also aren't used for usefulness they are used so kids don't have to challenge themselves (I did this for a couple years in college because I was working 2 jobs.) \n\nOn top of students telling everyone which professor is the easiest and most laid back professors are losing jobs left and right from those evaluations. I have since graduate and could possible teach. But the job market is so over populated that professors have a hard time finding work and keeping it. Many of the good professors get fired because they have all ones on their evaluations from students who didn't like they had to read the chapters instead of look at the power point online. So right now if you walked onto any college campus and took a class in say history you will see a professor giving out study guides with everything that will be on the test, all the notes for the test are posted online so I didn't need to pay attention and take notes. Oh and I didn't even have to be in class because she doesn't take roll. But she will keep her job because I will give her all 5's on the evaluation and tell my buddies how awesome she is for being easy. \n\nThis stuff has been scientifically studied. But I urge people to observe it for yourself. Try not to keep the mindset of being a lazy college kid trying to get out as quick as possible. Think about you being challenge then tell me if college is truly challenging you (this varies. Kids studying engineering or becoming a doctor will be challenged every day.) but my senior year of high school I had a teacher who would go through the whole test the day before (like in the meme.) I never didn't get a 100 because I knew all the answers from the day before. I was never challenged and couldn't even tell you anything I learned in that class. But that was high school. I was shocked to see some college classes are like this at state universities. And if you think this isn't a big deal just wait until you graduate with a degree but can't give the basics about the field of work you just majored in. Plus shit teachers shouldn't be rewarded for dumbing down a course. \n\nPS. Not saying you used the wrong meme or anything. I know how great that feeling is when you don't have to stress over a final. I too wish I could have the answers for any final. But I also didn't think about challenging myself until after I graduated. When you are a student you have a different mindset when it comes to test. Personally I don't even like test. Papers and essays are better ways to tell if a student is understanding the material. Plus it's funny watching people bullshit their way through an essay compared to a bubble test.

Further, surface level issues like grammar have become a lower priority than content based assessment. Are they clearly introducing and defining their concepts? Are they pairing their concept with an observable phenomenon? Do their ideas transition logically or in a cascading fashion? These are the high priorities for evaluation.\n\nKnowing all 5 comma rules is not incredibly important. Out of 3-4 months, I may give them 1-2 days of grammar.

Anyone who believes they are smarter than someone merely because you spell better than them is absurd.

You get my point? Just because my grammar is off doesn't make my claim any less valid.

The taxes ended up being about $9600 a year. That additional $400 a month would have pushed my budget to the eating noodles for dinner for a few years and saving almost nothing monthly.

They want to interview you and have access to your pets veterinarian records to make sure they get their shots. Some do a background check and a lot require a home visit to make sure your property is good enough for a fucking dog. Then I have seen some that specify they can make a surprise visit anytime in the first 6 months with some pushing it out to 24 months. \n\nYou have to pay for the home visit if they need to fly in. The shipping of the animal if they approve you and the adoption fee to the rescue. So you could spend $2000 to adopt a 6 year old dog or you could buy from a breeder the same dog as a puppy for less than $1000. \n\nThose people's hearts are in the right place but they went nuts. Many have shut down after a year or two because nobody is willing to jump through the hoops to adopt an animal from them and pay a premium to do it.

You can see breed specific rescues raising their adoption fees because they adopt out so few due to the agonizing and expensive process. \n\nNo I've never been turned down. I sent in an application for a bull mastiff rescue many years ago. The adoption fee was $300 plus $200 to crate and ship the dog. and the website said there would be a phone interview and they needed to be able to talk to my vet to see if my animals were cared for. When I talked to the woman she said she would also need me to fly her down for a home visit and then within 12 months she would visit again and I would have to sign a contract to reimburse that trip as well. I told her she could eat the corn out of my shit and ignored her calls. She had like 15 dogs and I don't know if she ever adopted any out. Her website and the phone for the rescue were shut off about a year later. She had been in business for 3 years before that and I could only find 5 dogs that had been adopted from her rescue. She wasn't being greedy she was just stupid to believe anyone is willing to spend that much money and put up with that kind of intrusion into their lives.

It's a terrible way to live life when your happiness and feelings of worth rely so much of external factors that are often not in your control.\n\nA basic summary of the book is it tells you the 6 core tenets you have to build up within yourself, and it tells you how to improve. It takes a lot of introspection, thinking, digging up uncomfortable feelings and emotions but it's a necessary obstacle if you want to reach the level of self-sufficiency you're looking for. A brief description of each tenet is:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n1. Consciousness - You have to be aware of how things in your life affect other things. You have to be aware of what's unpleasant in your life as well as whats pleasant (experience everything fully). You have to recognize your mistakes so you can fix them.\n\n2. Acceptance - This is the most difficult one for most people. I still have a hard time accepting myself fully and wholly at times. You have to recognize your mistakes and shortcomings. Maybe you don't like the way you look or the way you speak. You have to tell yourself that to have high self-esteem I need to have a good sense of reality, and reality is that I don't look attractive. I dislike the fact that I look unattractive but I accept it; either I can work on it gradually or I can't, but either way it is what it is for now.\n\n3. Responsibility - Basically be responsible for yourself, your goals, your actions. This involves organizing your life and picking what friends you hang out with, what food you eat, what time you sleep. Also you NEED to recognize that self-esteem is not easy to aquire, because no one else can give it to you. Not even ALL the external praise in the world can satisfy our innate need to be loved and accepted by ourselves.\n\n4. Assertiveness - Practice and develop a healthy and respectful level of assertiveness in your own time, energy and space. Don't push people away, but if you actually need space or time to do something learn how to say no. Conversely, know when you want something and when to go for it. If you develop this you will recognize that people with high self-esteem all realize and understand healthy assertiveness and respect for peoples space.\n\n5. Integrity - Very very important. Place your integrity above EVERYTHING. This means do you copy your friends homework before class to get that 10 points you would've missed? No, because even though it helps you in the short run, it permanently damages your view of yourself in a subconscious way. Be a good person and work hard not for external rewards and consequences but because you understand that everything you do has an effect on who you are as a person and how you view yourself.\n\n6. Purposefulness - Make sure you have long term goals. Otherwise you get distracted easily and you feel like what you're doing is pointless. Even if your long-term goals are nothing huge, don't worry about it, just worry about making sure at the end of every day you can say you've made reasonable progress."], [3, "[Two Points for Honesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSJcfA6byDk)."], [3, "That is a very useful realization about yourself.

When the high hit me I was taken to a place in my mind that had been in the background of my every thought but not ever in the front of my conscious. I saw myself as I imagined how I looked from a 130-degree angle above my head. \n\nWhen I saw that person the only feeling I had was hate and the impulse to further destroy what remained of that image. At the time I knew the only way to destroy that person was for them to die. I actually planned in that moment that when the high was gone and I woke up the next morning that I would literally kill myself.\n\nThen I fell asleep at a stranger's apartment where this whole psychedelic experience was taking place. When I woke up the dude and his girlfriend were already in their bedroom and I quietly left and drove back to where I lived. \n\nI knew that I had been given a first-hand experience of what my subconscious or maybe the other person who lives inside of my mind had to put up with every waking moment of my life at the time.\n\nThe only reason I didn't follow through with the plan I had the night before was my overwhelming hunger for food. \n\nI then decided that since I was going to continue living that I had to no longer imagine myself as if I was only mistakes and imperfections from the surface to the core. In a way, I still planned the demise of the person I saw then but in a metaphorical sense.\n\nMy first step toward achieving my goal was to replace any negative monologue I had toward myself with one that suggested I could change what prompted the introspection. If I disliked the blemishes on my face instead of thinking about how ugly I felt that I would wash my face and then think about something else.\n\nI won't lie and say that there were never any setbacks. I also have stopped talking to the person who gave me the dab in the first place because they supported the negative intrusive thoughts. It's been a little over two years since that night.\n\nI can say that the person that existed then has almost disintegrated into a memory. They have been replaced with optimism and personality. All of the things I wish I could do then I have already excelled past.\n\nI'll tell you this directly so it is clear. You are the one who decides who you are. If you want to become someone who knows who they are then you have to create that person with the material you already have. There are no shortcuts. It will take a long time. Nothing that is valuable to a person will ever become their possession easily but once they have it retaining it becomes easier.

I dislike the fact that I look unattractive but I accept it; either I can work on it gradually or I can't, but either way it is what it is for now.\n\n3. Responsibility - Basically be responsible for yourself, your goals, your actions. This involves organizing your life and picking what friends you hang out with, what food you eat, what time you sleep. Also you NEED to recognize that self-esteem is not easy to aquire, because no one else can give it to you. Not even ALL the external praise in the world can satisfy our innate need to be loved and accepted by ourselves.\n\n4. Assertiveness - Practice and develop a healthy and respectful level of assertiveness in your own time, energy and space. Don't push people away, but if you actually need space or time to do something learn how to say no. Conversely, know when you want something and when to go for it. If you develop this you will recognize that people with high self-esteem all realize and understand healthy assertiveness and respect for peoples space.\n\n5. Integrity - Very very important. Place your integrity above EVERYTHING. This means do you copy your friends homework before class to get that 10 points you would've missed? No, because even though it helps you in the short run, it permanently damages your view of yourself in a subconscious way. Be a good person and work hard not for external rewards and consequences but because you understand that everything you do has an effect on who you are as a person and how you view yourself.\n\n6. Purposefulness - Make sure you have long term goals. Otherwise you get distracted easily and you feel like what you're doing is pointless. Even if your long-term goals are nothing huge, don't worry about it, just worry about making sure at the end of every day you can say you've made reasonable progress.", "id": "darf1yt"}], [{"comment": "[Two Points for Honesty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSJcfA6byDk).", "id": "dar1ear"}], [{"comment": "That is a very useful realization about yourself.

When the high hit me I was taken to a place in my mind that had been in the background of my every thought but not ever in the front of my conscious. I saw myself as I imagined how I looked from a 130-degree angle above my head. \n\nWhen I saw that person the only feeling I had was hate and the impulse to further destroy what remained of that image. At the time I knew the only way to destroy that person was for them to die. I actually planned in that moment that when the high was gone and I woke up the next morning that I would literally kill myself.\n\nThen I fell asleep at a stranger's apartment where this whole psychedelic experience was taking place. When I woke up the dude and his girlfriend were already in their bedroom and I quietly left and drove back to where I lived. \n\nI knew that I had been given a first-hand experience of what my subconscious or maybe the other person who lives inside of my mind had to put up with every waking moment of my life at the time.\n\nThe only reason I didn't follow through with the plan I had the night before was my overwhelming hunger for food. \n\nI then decided that since I was going to continue living that I had to no longer imagine myself as if I was only mistakes and imperfections from the surface to the core. In a way, I still planned the demise of the person I saw then but in a metaphorical sense.\n\nMy first step toward achieving my goal was to replace any negative monologue I had toward myself with one that suggested I could change what prompted the introspection. If I disliked the blemishes on my face instead of thinking about how ugly I felt that I would wash my face and then think about something else.\n\nI won't lie and say that there were never any setbacks. I also have stopped talking to the person who gave me the dab in the first place because they supported the negative intrusive thoughts. It's been a little over two years since that night.\n\nI can say that the person that existed then has almost disintegrated into a memory. They have been replaced with optimism and personality. All of the things I wish I could do then I have already excelled past.\n\nI'll tell you this directly so it is clear. You are the one who decides who you are. If you want to become someone who knows who they are then you have to create that person with the material you already have. There are no shortcuts. It will take a long time. Nothing that is valuable to a person will ever become their possession easily but once they have it retaining it becomes easier. While that which you wish you could cast away will never disappear completely.\n\nI hope you the best of luck stranger.

I have a very rare Bone Marrow Failure disease called Aplastic Anemia. While it may seem like I have cancer in all but name, seeing as I needed chemo and a transplant, I actually really do have it better: They aren't looking for a response to the chemo from the cancer, its only job with me is to kill my bone marrow, so they know it worked and I'm clear for the transplant once my blood production went way down to basically nothing. Also, they aren't really worried about it coming back after I'm cured. *Also*, there is an over 90% cure rate for this disease, so pretty good numbers.  \n\n2) Yes, the chances of a sibling being a match is about 1/4. I have 8 siblings. 7 were tested (one was ineligible due to a prior illness), and of those seven, 3 were full matches, 2 brothers and a sister! My brother was chosen because he was younger than the other brother, and males are always preferred to give marrow to males, especially if the female had children - my sister has three.  \n\n3) The full length of my hospital stay should be about 3-4 weeks. Today marks 3 weeks, so nearing the end hopefully.  \n\n4) Literally any day now! The normal time for it to start working is about 14-18 days, and today is the 15th day. Currently my white blood cell count is 0.1, with normal being around 4.5-10. The chemo is what caused it to go from being very low, about 2.2, to basically nothing, but this is done on purpose to allow the transplant to work.

You will get checked out very thoroughly and if you are an eligible donor we will, most of the times, send you home with injections for the last 4 days (and day 5 the big day when you actually donate) leading up to the donation and a lot of imformation material and numbers of our 24h emergency phone and the like.\nIf you can't do the shots yourself (Hello fellow Gentlemen, just tiny needles), we can ask a local health care provider or caretaker service to visit you twice a day for your shots.\n\nThe drug, called Filgrastin, tricks your immune system into believing it is under attack, therefore you can feel a little like having the flu. This sends the cells that the patient needs (CD 34 + for those wondering) into your bloodstream where we can collect them in a process called Apheresis.  \nIn some ways similar to a dialysis, an Apheresis might be necessary for cirtain malignancies and can be used (in a modified version) for peripheral stem cell colection. [Here's a video I found online that explains it a bit more coherent](https://www.cellex.me/en/donating-stem-cells/startpage) \n\n\nIf you consider registrating yourself as a stem cell donor you can find more information here [Be the match](https://www.bethematch.org)  for the United States, or [DKMS](https://www.dkms.de)  for Germany or [Anthony Nolan Trust](https://www.anthonynolan.org)  for the United Kingdom.

Eventually your bone marrow gets too crowded and cells of all lines, including stem cells leak from the bone marrow into the blood.

With something like that, there's realistically <1% chance of it happening, at least in my old shops.

When we do 10-20 oil changes a day, it's pretty good odds that it won't happen to you.  \n\nA lot of that also has to do with how the shop is ran, and making sure you don't overload someone with too many things at once, and they forget a step on a vehicle because they got distracted or couldn't multi-task well enough to keep up with their workload.  That's usually why mistakes happen.  \n\nThat being said, with as many times as you get your oil changed a year (call it 4) and adding to that everybody you know doing the same, almost everybody knows someone that it's happened to.  \n\nThe other side of it being that occassionally the drain plug itself wears out over time.  Not in your sister's case as it was a new car, but in older vehicles (10+ years usually, and Honda's are notoriously bad for it) the drain plugs strip and/or the crush washer goes bad, causing a leak.  In the latter case, it's hard to notice until the car's been driven for a while.  I've had to explain this to several customers and the response is generally, \"You're full of shit and just making excuses for your guy's not tightening the drain plug all the way.  Hell no I'm not paying for a new washer, and you're paying for my driveway to be cleaned.\"  \n\nThat's why I left the industry.  Everyone thinks you're a scumbag regardless of what's happening, and even when you tell the truth and do your best to run an honest shop, people will still think you're trying to screw them over. \n\nBut my main point is this:  the auto part store employees don't work on cars for a living.  They sell car parts.  There's a big difference.  I normally didn't even let my oil change and tire techs do spark plugs on customer vehicles.  Let alone some parts guy in a parking lot.

That's a ludicrous cost!  ", "id": "daq4t7w"}, {"comment": "I'm not defending the US healthcare system, but people should understand why this bill is so high.\n\nIn a nutshell, insurance companies here generally will only reimburse a healthcare provider for a small percentage of the charges that that they are billed for (a maximum allowable amount per service). For high ticket procedures like this it's usually less than 10%. Healthcare providers know this so they intentionally overbill the insurance company in order to keep the reimbursements at the current level. If they suddenly started billing less, the insurance company would assume that the hospital is able to perform that service for a lower cost and would reduce their maximum allowable amount that they would pay for that service. If a patient has decent insurance, their copay is usually at most a small percentage of the maximum allowable amount (this can still be several thousand dollars for a complicated procedure and/or a prolonged hospital stay).\n\nThis becomes a bigger problem for patients without insurance since providers cannot officially charge them less than they charge the insurance company, which is one reason why we keep seeing these ridiculous hospital bills posted on Reddit. That being said, almost all hospitals/non-profit medical providers will work with uninsured/underinsured patients by having them pay an unofficial discounted price similar to what they would expect to receive from the insurance company, often through a reasonable payment plan. They also have the option of writing off a portion of the charges for tax reasons.\n\n\nEdit: \nJust as an example of how little insurers actually pay: Medicare reimbursement for lithotripsy in 2014 (CPT code 50590): $1652 (national average). Private insurers may reimburse at a slightly higher rate and Medicaid at a slightly lower rate.\nAlso just off the top of my head after rotating at multiple hospitals and clinics, for the blood tests listed (hematology and chemistry), if they were routine pre-op labs (CBC & CMP), the total cost and reimbursement likely did not exceed $20. I do not know anything about the OR equipment/anesthesia/pharmacy costs.\n\nAgain, my purpose is not to defend anyone involved in this, I just wanted to explain how this system works and that hospital bills are negotiable. Unfortunately whether people like it or not, this ridiculous system is unlikely to change regardless of which political party is in power.\n\n", "id": "daq9l72"}, {"comment": "Jesus, I had a kidney stone about 2 months ago and it was about $700 at most, mostly for the MRI, and I live in the US", "id": "daq3urm"}, {"comment": "That's some expensive flowers", "id": "daq44rv"}, {"comment": "Looked straight for the total.

In fact, by removing the drug, you're actually decreasing a drug-resistant bacterium's fitness when compared to a wild-type bacterium if it's managed to appear. Thus, stopping antibiotics early only serves to stop the promotion of drug resistance more quickly. \n\nMore and more studies are coming out suggesting this is the appropriate course of action; however, many antibiotic courses are somewhat arbitrarily decided so we don't necessarily know what the actual minimum dosage is. Often times when you feel better is an acceptable time to stop taking the drugs as it *can* mean your immune system is enough to clear the remainder of the infection.

My point is that there is a different side to this, I have noticed a lot of doctors are too scared to provide antibiotics now, and what was obvious to me to be an infection she just assumed it to be viral. And before the doctors would just assume it to be bacterial.

But viruses work by infecting the host's own cells (as in your cells... that you actually really need in order to function) so antiviral drugs have a tendency to kill *your cells* along with the virus that's invaded them.

If you saw a mouse in your bedroom, you might reasonably assume you have a mouse problem and want to fix it.\n\nTaking antibiotics is like setting mouse traps in your house. You keep setting out traps until the traps stop catching mice (and then leave the traps out for a bit longer just to make sure you got all the mice).\n\nTaking antivirals is like setting fire to your bedroom and hoping you can keep it from burning down your entire house before all the mice are gone.", "id": "daostsq"}, {"comment": "Not to mention that many antivirals aren't even extremely effective (unless they're extremely detrimental).", "id": "daow7po"}, {"comment": "As long as you take care of yourself (stay hydrated and eat a bit and rest), your body should be able to handle most viral infections perfectly well on its own.
