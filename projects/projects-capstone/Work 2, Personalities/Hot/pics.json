Now, being a man might make a difference if there was a woman Santa, but that's another discussion. The same goes for any fictional character like Superman or Batman. These guys were created white because that's the majority race in the U.S., but their being white has no direct relationship to their skills or abilities. \n\nWhenever I hear stories about different races playing predominantly white characters, I'm always reminded of Stan Lee's story on why he put a mask on Spiderman. He said that he wanted **all** kids to feel like they can be Spiderman regardless of the color of their skin.\n\nI'm white myself, but I've often wondered how it must have felt to be a black child growing up in the heyday of comic books and all of your favorite heroes and stars were white.

The process is made to select for very capable people who could have high income potential in any number of fields. Medicine is a poor choice if one just wants to get rich. It draws people who want to help others in the deepest ways. \n\nGoing through medical training is a large sacrifice. It is giving up your 20s to spend hour after hour studying, and building hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt to do so for 4 years of undergrad and another 4 years of med school. Then finally making a small salary in residency (another 3-7 years) while working 60-80 hour weeks and paying that mountain of debt. During this time of living like a broke college student for the 11-15 straight years, one sees everyone else doing better. Their capable friends from college are now rich, those who worked simple jobs straight out of high school have houses, boats, and nice cars. This while we can't afford to replace the 15 year old car, put off starting a family, and live in crappy rentals. We also see the old docs (who had minimal tuition) living very comfortably. \n\nSo yes, if you want capable and intelligent people to continue to choose medicine so that you'll have a competent physician, then salaries need to he reasonably high.

I often give anesthesia for ortho trauma cases, and was doing so one night for a 42 year old healthy male who had fractured his femoral head while skiing. Other than this injury, he, (unlike millions of his fellow countrymen), had no comorbidities to complicate the anesthesia and surgery he had to undergo. He wasn't obese, such that the instrumentation of his airway was straightforward and easy, and the surgery quicker than it would be with more redundant tissue to dissect. He was in great cardiovascular health, such that the inevitable hemodynamic swings associated with the induction of anesthesia were easily compensated for by his robust heart, vasculature, and CNS. He didn't have diabetes,  or increased risk of MI secondary to autonomic neuropathy associated with that disease. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately for him, what he did have was a clumsy surgeon, who nicked his femoral artery in the process of repairing his hip. Over the course of the next three hours he lost 5 liters of blood, his whole blood volume and then some.  The next day he was sitting up in the ICU bed chatting as usual, (if a little anemic), and was transferred to a regular floor the next day and discharged the day after that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf that had happened to an average American of 42 years of age, they may not have survived the surgery, and very likely would have had a multimillion dollar hospital stay to recover. Why? Because athletic, healthy people, even when they suffer trauma compounded by medical error, STILL fare better than their unhealthy counterparts, and utilize far fewer healthcare resources.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo when you ask me that question, it strikes me as absurd. *OF COURSE* I would rather people have active, athletic lives, even with the increased risk of trauma, because the risk is FAR outweighed by the decreased healthcare costs that result, accident notwithstanding.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I don't think people should pay for healthcare\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThere is not a single place on this planet where healthcare is free.

They inflated it on the grass in our backyard and after trying and failing to kick it more than a few feet I figured out how to scramble on top of it and balance myself there on my knees and I discovered that by both wiggling and humping the ball I could move around the yard. I wiggle-humped forward and backward and side to side, I circumambulated the yard. I became the boy with three balls. I graduated to the front yard and then moved from there to the street and rolled down roads and when I reached the bottom of a hill I would get off and push my big ball up the hill. My big ball gave me strength and balance and confidence, taught me what it means to care for a ball, and by caring for one ball, I learned how to care for all balls.\n\n\nI did not go very far those first few weeks but by the end of the month I was rolling around town, waving at people, staring down from my high perch at all the other boys. I had three balls and they did not. I ranged above six feet, was higher than the sixth grade girls, and they were not. I refused to let anyone ride my big ball and perhaps that was my downfall. By that point I was spending at least four hours a day on him (any inanimate thing a male spends any significant amount of time on top of is eventually anthropomorphized and so earns a name). Big Ben was a ball above (or below) other balls. \n\n\nAh, Big Ben. I miss you. I\u2019m sorry for what happened.

I\u2019m sorry for not treating you the way a big ball should be treated, with love, and only the gentlest of humping, never to be kicked or squeezed or pierced. And yet all these things would happen to you and I am to blame. I remember the day you deflated. I remember falling to the ground as the first stick pierced your hide and the howling of the other boys as they stabbed you over and over with their sharp sticks and then, after you had gone from proud sphere to crumpled circle, how they jumped on top of your dying body.

If your unit tries to deny you that time, nod your head and tell them you'd like to utilize your NCO support channel/chain of command to speak with the Battalion CSM/Commander. If they don't do anything about it, take it to the brigade commander, and so on. This is the next chapter of your life that you're about to embark on; don't let an E6 that you'll never see again tell you that you're not allowed to go to ACAP or appointments. ACAP is governed and mandated by federal law. It is NOT optional, and it is NOT something that any NCO or officer can deny you.

Most people overestimate the effect of humid climates because they think it's regularly hotter than it actually is or the humidity is higher than it actually is or that the combination thereof has a greater effect than it does. [This chart shows](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/heat/heat_index.shtml) the effect of humidity on temperature. With average highs in Miami reaching [high 80s to low 90s](http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/miami/florida/united-states/usfl0316) and average humidity at the peak of the day heat being [45-60%](https://climatecenter.fsu.edu/products-services/data/other-normals/relative-humidity), the heat index is still below 100 most days. Additionally, Miami still gets down into the 70s at night, at which point the humidity has a near negligible effect on heat index.\n\n Compare that to Phoenix, which has average [105+](http://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/phoenix/arizona/united-states/usaz0166) highs in summer and 85 degrees lows for the day and the comparison clearly shows a dry place like Phoenix being the \"hotter\" of the two by meteorological standards.\n\nOf course, people are free to have an opinion on which they prefer, but the idea of a \"dry heat\" being somehow less hot than the hot/humid parts of the country is objectively false.\n", "id": "dap8lmx"}, {"comment": "As a native Louisianian that lived in New Mexico for a year, I definitely prefer the humidity.

There were some minor concerns about the foam-strike during liftoff, but the Columbia wasn't anywhere near the space station, nor did it have the proper fuel to make it up to the ISS's orbit for the station to do a check for damage.  There was never any plans to get the crew to the station as the shuttle couldn't make it to it.  Using the ISS to check the shuttle for damage via a 360 flip only became standard after the Columbia incident.\n\nThe only thing they could have done was a spacewalk to check-out the damage, but engineers on the ground felt there likely wasn't sufficient damage to warrant a dangerous spacewalk just to do that.  Had they known the true damage, they would have had to wait about 3-4 weeks in orbit, and rush the next shuttle (I believe it was Atlantis) to the pad to conduct a rescue mission.  \n\nBut again, the engineers had no idea the foam strike could do such damage.  When they actually conducted ground tests after the accident and saw the foam COULD create such damage, you could hear audible gasps on the camera from the engineers conducting the test, they did not expect it would punch thru the carbon-fiber wing edge the way it did.\n\nEDIT: Adding link to the ground-test after the accident, where you can hear the engineers gasp as the foam punched thru the wing: https://youtu.be/suniiico7z4?t=1m30s", "id": "darag0e"}, {"comment": "> Had they known the true damage, they would have had to wait about 3-4 weeks in orbit, and rush the next shuttle (I believe it was Atlantis) to the pad to conduct a rescue mission.\n\nRushing the other shuttle seems like a sketchy option-- endangering another crew, etc, if you even get it done in time.  And it leaves the question of what you do with the other shuttle-- give up on the vehicle, try and retrofit it to enter completely autonomously, etc).\n\nBut-- there were also been on-orbit repair options that might have been sufficient with the materials they had on hand.  The shuttle dissipated a significant portion of its entry with its normal entry profile.  If you ditched all the mass you could to lower thermal loading, flew a profile that put more heat on the right wing than the left, and packed the opening in the wing with ice and metal tools, they'd have had a decent shot of survival.", "id": "darb5e6"}, {"comment": "You are absolutely right...it would have been a huge rush to get the next shuttle ready and may have not been feasible due to the risks of expediting a launch. I am a solid believer if NASA knew how bad it was, they would have exhibited Apollo XIII-esque ingenuity to get the crew home safely. If it was calling up the Russians to get a Soyuz up or patching the wing as you suggested....I am pretty confident they would have gotten the crew home alive.", "id": "darbd37"}, {"comment": ">they had the shuttle do a roll so the ISS crew could get cameras on the impact zone.\n\nThis is not true, Columbia was an older orbiter that was too heavy to even reach the ISS, the shuttle flip and camera inspection was only added to space shuttle missions afterward, because of the Columbia disaster.\n\nThe real tragedy was NASA trying to make use of an obsolete, and dangerous orbiter.

Michael was the main focus of the show, and all the other characters worked so perfectly because their mannerisms came through in smaller doses while Michael's flaws (and attributes, for that matter) took center stage.\n\nAfter his departure and until the end of the series, they tried to fill that void, primarily with Andy but also by spreading out Michael's personality to the rest of the cast.  I think it just didn't work for most fans because everyone either felt out-of-character or just became a parody of who they were in earlier years.  It crossed too far past the line of being \"just barely\" plausible, which is what made The Office so popular in the first place.\n\n**tl;dr** If I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.", "id": "daq4pul"}, {"comment": "I hated the focus on Andy.

Reddit, or the artist.\n\nORANGE.\nPositive: Physical comfort, food, warmth, security, sensuality, passion, abundance, fun. \nNegative: Deprivation, frustration, frivolity, immaturity.\n\nSince it is a combination of red and yellow, orange is stimulating and reaction to it is a combination of the physical and the emotional. It focuses our minds on issues of physical comfort - food, warmth, shelter etc. - and sensuality. It is a 'fun' colour. Negatively, it might focus on the exact opposite - deprivation. This is particularly likely when warm orange is used with black. Equally, too much orange suggests frivolity and a lack of serious intellectual values.\n\nBLUE. Intellectual.\nPositive: Intelligence, communication, trust, efficiency, serenity, duty, logic, coolness, reflection, calm.\nNegative: Coldness, aloofness, lack of emotion, unfriendliness.\n\nBlue is the colour of the mind and is essentially soothing; it affects us mentally, rather than the physical reaction we have to red. Strong blues will stimulate clear thought and lighter, soft blues will calm the mind and aid concentration. Consequently it is serene and mentally calming. It is the colour of clear communication. Blue objects do not appear to be as close to us as red ones. Time and again in research, blue is the world's favourite colour.

Real conversations, life changing ones even, could be found in abundance. BUT, that is not all! The Downvote too has had its colors changed to that of the upvote.

Reddit, or the artist.\n\nORANGE.\nPositive: Physical comfort, food, warmth, security, sensuality, passion, abundance, fun. \nNegative: Deprivation, frustration, frivolity, immaturity.\n\nSince it is a combination of red and yellow, orange is stimulating and reaction to it is a combination of the physical and the emotional. It focuses our minds on issues of physical comfort - food, warmth, shelter etc. - and sensuality. It is a 'fun' colour. Negatively, it might focus on the exact opposite - deprivation. This is particularly likely when warm orange is used with black. Equally, too much orange suggests frivolity and a lack of serious intellectual values.\n\nBLUE. Intellectual.\nPositive: Intelligence, communication, trust, efficiency, serenity, duty, logic, coolness, reflection, calm.\nNegative: Coldness, aloofness, lack of emotion, unfriendliness.\n\nBlue is the colour of the mind and is essentially soothing; it affects us mentally, rather than the physical reaction we have to red. Strong blues will stimulate clear thought and lighter, soft blues will calm the mind and aid concentration. Consequently it is serene and mentally calming. It is the colour of clear communication. Blue objects do not appear to be as close to us as red ones. Time and again in research, blue is the world's favourite colour.

There's a lot of old guard guys like this retiring right now. They are some of the last of the people who worked in a very different USPS than the ones who are currently delivering the mail. They remember active cronyism, political instability every election cycle, hard-fought battles between craft and management. \n\nAlso too there was an abundance of ex-military peppered across the ranks and it was common to have uniform inspections, line-ups, and the camaraderie that tight working 'brothers' develop. Senior carriers were expected to police the newer guys and help mold them into a carrier who can do the exact same thing every single day for decades without going crazy or stopping caring about how well it gets done.\n\nThis guy worked in a USPS where you shined your hat badge and someone checked to make sure it was done and done right.\n\nYou guys are completely wrong about him doing it for tips. He's leaving these notes because leaving paper notes is all he's ever done and it's all he knows and it's about to end. This is a man grieving his proverbial end.\n\nShit, now I'm forced to consider my own.

Genuinely curious.", "id": "daqcd93"}, {"comment": "I've been actively in the post office since the late eighties but my dad was a letter carrier too so it's all I've ever known. Some of my earliest memories are of climbing the empty equipment mail sacks and watching carriers hand case everything into bundles held with leather straps. \n\nMost people don't appreciate how political the post office was. \"Postmaster\" was an appointed position so it was often given as political favors for supporters. This meant each election cycle likely meant changes (some drastic) in your office and if you didn't get on board with them...well you could find yourself under intense scrutiny and pressure until you fell into line. Mailmen went all-in on the NALC union and collective bargaining put a stop to most of this. It's steadily gotten better and less political, however vestiges still remain. For example I'm not allowed to run for a partisan office or else I'll lose my job. \n\nI can't do justice to these older guys who worked through all that transitional time. It can be a brutal job: the repetitive stress on your hands and knees, carpel tunnel from always having to hold things unnaturally, rotator cuffs destroyed from reaching out to mailboxes a thousand times a day every day. Even worse is the mental strain this daily grind of the exact same thing can do to you. These older carriers treated it like a damn serious thing though. They cared and took a lot of pride in the job. I really miss that sense of pride in performance of duty.\n\nThe post office now is entirely performance driven. Deliver more mail in less time, nothing else matters. Carriers look sloppy and there's sadly little emphasis on image. We drive nearly destroyed mail trucks and wear uniforms that look horribly generic. The post office is collapsing from within too and I think it's not at all sustainable. The career workforce is being replaced (sorry...SUPPLEMENTED) with non-career temp workers. These guys don't have the work protections I have and they are often forced to work seven day weeks. It's common now to see these non-career people doing 20 or 30 days without a day off now that we do Sunday delivery across most markets. It's no wonder they don't care and end up quitting. Retention rates are abysmal and there's no sign things will change. It saddens me to see my post office falling into such a state. It makes the public unhappy and we just look bad when Joe Someone has a new mailman twice a year.\n\nAh, sorry to be long-winded.

Carriers were actually allowed to leave work whenever they had finished their route so often people did 5-7 hour days and still got the full pay.\n\nI have worked part time as mailman from 2011 and things have just gotten worse every year. The amount of mail decreases so the mail carrying routes get longer every year. But this change is not proportional. In 2011 when I started and was slow at my job it was very rare that I worked a 10 hour a shift. Now everytime I go there I'll be lucky to get my work done in ten hours.

The world is a better place when we are good to each other.  I will say that with many businesses customers have been conditioned to be an asshole to have problems resolved.  I work in a call center and there are things I can do that I can't offer unless the customer asks and things that I cannot do but management can if the customer requests it.  I can't bend the rules and offer customers a better \"restricted\" solution because the calls are recorded and monitored and I could lose my job for offering that solution unprompted.  This kind of customer service strategy produces frustrated, escalated customers and the escalation allows me (or the manager, if needed) to take further steps to resolve the issue.  The net result is a system that rewards customers for bad behavior and customers know it.  \n\nThe nuance lost in this conditioned consumer behavior is this: in most cases yelling at your rep is not what triggers the secondary solutions--it's simply asking for a different or better solution.  Escalation doesn't have to be hostile.  Want a fee refunded because the service wasn't performed as expected?  Just ask for it.  I can make that happen.  The guy I had on the phone yesterday who calmly asked for his delivery fee back got refunded the same way the screaming guy I talked to previously did. And if your request is reasonable but unorthodox, just ask for it.  If I can't accommodate, the manager probably can.  The vitriol is pretty much never necessary but it is conditioned and that is absolutely the company's fault.\n\nAs an aside, everyone please be kind to call center customer service reps.  Working at a call center is one of the most emotionally and/or psychologically damaging jobs one can have in the service industry.  You wouldn't think it's that bad looking in from the outside, but being screamed at and spoken to like trash hundreds of times a day is seriously horrible.  Reps regularly put customers on hold and cry at their desks.  Absenteeism and turnover is huge.  Everybody smokes.  Most people drink heavily.  People kill themselves because of the stress and depression triggered by this job.  People develop anxiety from the sound of phones ringing.  It's honestly Pavlovian--you expect to be savagely ambushed.  All of this would be more bearable if reps could defend themselves, but in most cases they cannot.  You can't speak up for yourself and you certainly can't disconnect customers.  Customers are typically much more agitated and aggressive over the phone as well--it's a detached interaction where they are not face-to-face and the rep is just a disembodied voice to be abused to achieve a goal.  People lose the filter and restraint that they would have in an in-person interaction.  Customers become bullies even as they feel the company is bullying them.  Unchecked hostility rules on the phone.  \n\nJust try to remember that the voice on the other end of the line is a person who can be affected by your behavior, and as much as it seems like you have to be a dick to get what you want, if you are in the right you just need to ask for resolution to your satisfaction.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "daqvk3e"}]]], "5gczos": ["Cat under tree, his name is Korben", "2016-12-04 04:24:17", 7, "http://i.imgur.com/eJeVxDX.jpg", [[4, "Korbennnnn Dallassss!"], [2, "Black cat party Kitty Selfie http://i.imgur.com/SSlgzIO.jpg"], [1, "she got pretty eyes.

It'll open your eyes.\n\nI appreciate the invitation, but unfortunately this is incredibly impractical for large portions of the population. I'd have to completely derail my life, somehow score a job, and find a way to cough up large amounts of money (obviously for travel I'd just need the money). I could do it because I have a decent, marketable job, but even then it's a huge stretch.\n\nAnd despite your assertion that travel will convince me that Europe is so much better, everything I've heard from citizens and seen in the news/current events makes me extremely skeptical. I have family, friends, and co-workers that are European citizens and are absolutely furious with the state of affairs, and want out. \n\nThey're currently facing issues with nationalism and xenophobia. They have crime and guns; FFS Kim Kardashian was recently held up in Paris. They have citizens who can't get an education. Maybe some of these things are worse in the US; I'd like to see reform in the medical and education industries, specifically. \n\nI don't think that just because a country might be struggling more with some of the above, it's automatically \"worse\". I'm also a bit skeptical that programs that seem to have some success oversees, at astronomical cost, will scale to a country like the US. Also, not quite sure comparing countries that are slightly larger than my home state ie. 1/50 of the country is an apples to apples comparison.\n\nI know multiple people from Europe who are trying to gain citizenship in the US. Hell, I have friends and family coming here specifically for educational opportunities. That's right our horrible education system is drawing people here. The truth is we have fantastic universities, and college education is in reach for the vast majority of the population. It's can be a huge risk, and you have to consider ROI, but with decent academics it can be quit affordable. There are issues with corruption and cost, but the education system isn't necessarily as terrible as people make it out to be .\n\nAmerica is 100% on par with any country overall. I agree with /u/Ebelglorg, that other countries are not criticizing because they're \"jealous\", this is absolutely asinine. Claiming that other countries are just better is almost as ridiculous. ", "id": "daqivib"}, {"comment": ">So the only way we judge that a country is \"better\", is by the number of social safety nets?\n\nNot quite the only way, but certainly one measure. Social safety nets are crucial to defining the bottom--the floor--of a society. Those with such structures tend to have a higher floor than those without.\n\n>The reality is that there's no objective way of judging how \"good\" a country is.\n\nOf course there are. That's part of what political scientists, economists, and policy scholars do. It's one thing if you don't know of any standards here, but don't claim things that are simply erroneous.\n\nTraveling doesn't necessitate the sort of dramatic upheaval you describe. Obviously, I'm aware that not everyone has had a chance to live in multiple nations (whether by choice or otherwise). The fact remains that such experiences provide a wider perspective.\n\nThat said, anecdotal accounts cut both ways: good and bad.\n\nThose issues you describe are of fairly recent vintage and certainly not characteristic of modern European life (a broad generalization in and of itself, but let's just take the EU as a general example). Yes, migration and trade has a significant role there, and these are challenges that are being negotiated. One way is of course the rise of idiotic Trump-like blowhards. One hopes that most European nations will see better sense than that.\n\nEducation is not an industry, and to claim that it is adopts the American perspective. I do not share that, and I believe education is a social good. I would point out that education is in fact far better funded and provided in many European nations, particularly with regard to costs incurred by individuals. \n\nThe scale argument is frequently cited and equally frequently found wanting. It's a tired argument at this point. \n\nI am in academe, so I am more than familiar with the higher-ed scenario in the US. Roughly 25% of all collegiate institutions are indeed world-class, and so they obviously draw international talent. These institutions can afford to be generous with financial aid, regardless of what one wishes to study. The vast majority require incurring absurd amounts of debt (in an international context) where education ought to be something provided to residents and citizens of a society at no, or minimal, cost. \n\nMy original point was to establish a clear pattern: American society is not set up to programmatically respond to and safeguard certain fundamentals of society to the extent many other societies are. None of this discussion refutes any of that. As long as American society does not do a better job of attending to those fundamentals (yes, that includes \"free\" education and national/universal healthcare) it will certainly not be on par with the most developed societies elsewhere (which was a claim originally made that I refuted).

It's one thing if you don't know of any standards here, but don't claim things that are simply erroneous.\"\n\n\nWTF are you talking about. You are the one being completely erroneous about that specific point. This is the problem with putting academics on a pedestal; you stop realizing the limits of your tools. There is no objective measure for things like \"goodness\" and \"better\". Without further specification you're simply talking about a matter of taste. \n\nYou're correct that social safety nets are a valid criteria (provided you consider effectiveness and ROI). A number of other things could be considered too, for example: tax burden, cultural  diversity or homogeneity, crime, access to guns (both control or freedom may be considered), economic equality, a large middle class, prosperity among the \"elite\", a strong military, pacifism/neutrality, friendliness of the population, public health, education, quality of food, or scenery. Some of these things may be more reasonable than others, but without further definition of your claim, it's impossible make any informed judgement, because it's not clear what we're judging. \n\nTo make a claim of how \"good\" a country is, you're aggregating some of these things (or picking just one) based on what you deem important, which is by definition NOT objective. Pretending that you have an objective measure for something that is impossible to objectively measure is deceptive and dangerous. This might seem like a small point, but it's crucial. Science, reason, and logic are extremely valuable, but they need to be used responsibly.\n\nOne more thing: my experience is that there are MANY adequate to good universities in the US; it's not just \"the top 25%\". Lots of people are coming here because they're getting shut out of academia in other countries; they're being told you (specifically you) don't get to study this.
