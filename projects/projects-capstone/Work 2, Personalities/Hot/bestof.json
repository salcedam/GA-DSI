You can't digitally sign anything without entrusting part of the signature key to the user (the private key) and doing the signature client side, otherwise someone could just resign your comment after editing it. So how do you propose the user manage the private key? Any approach to this drastically changes the nature of Reddit because it adds a difficult layer of complexity to creating an account or accessing that account anywhere other than where it was originally created, and if you lose your key you lose your account. You can't make it password based because if you change your password you invalidate your comment history. \n\nThere is no approach to this that doesn't further stratify the user base. Many users would sooner leave the site than jump through technical hurdles, which hurts business and would change the demographic and purpose of this site. It's not a viable solution unless you can convince millions of Reddit users that copying some weird text string from a file on their desktop every time they log in is necessary because of the small chance someone might edit their comments without their knowing. The number of users who this would directly affect is small. Even I don't care. Nobody would have motive to edit my comments, other than being a minor power user I am of little importance in the grand scheme of things and I'd likely stop using the site before I bothered with keys. Imagine how many more lurkers there would be when thousands of Joe Blows don't bother signing up because \"what's a private key?\"", "id": "dan70rg"}, {"comment": "Honestly, its seemed for some time she was merely a scapegoat.

I make sure I have the confirmation email for my flight queued up on my phone before I arrive, and I even screenshot it in case the whole internet goes down in the world.\n\n4. All liquids/gels have to be kept in a single 1L Ziploc bag together. Also I'm not sure what the size limit is on bottles but I had a bigger bottle of soap that fit easily in the 1L bag and they made me toss it, so I looked like an idiot. Best to stick with 'travel-size' or look up the bottle size limit. If your bag gets searched and you get pulled aside, you're probably not going to jail. I've been pulled out so they could flip through the pages of House of Leaves. Their scanners thought they picked something up.\n\n5. This is a little out of order, but I always text myself and screenshot where I parked...terminal, color of the lot, etc. That way when I land in terminal E but took off out of terminal A, I'm not walking around the terminal A lot looking for my car. After a few days you'll also have trouble googling the terminal that you left from because flight #s get recycled, so good thing you documented it! \n\n6. Your \"boarding group #\" should be on your printed boarding pass. They'll call your boarding group to board. If you line up as soon as they begin boarding and you're boarding group 5, you're going to be standing there with your stuff for an eternity. Everyone else will line up. Let them, and wait until your group # is actually called.\n\n7. When the plane stops after landing, everyone is going to stand up immediately, all uncomfortably, and stand there indefinitely. Just keep your seat and chill until the line moves. Don't dart out in front of the people in the seats in front of you. Wait your turn.\n\n8. Turbulence might cause the plane to jump around more than you feel comfortable with. You're probably not crashing.\n\n9. When in your seat, keep your arms to yourself, within the invisible box of the seat space that you purchased. Keep your damn shoes on. Don't breathe on your neighbor. Don't squirm a tremendous amount. Find an activity and stick with it for a while. If you have a carry-on that's small enough, you can put it under the seat in front of you. This is where you should've packed your ipod, gaming device, book, stuff you'll need in-flight. Digging around in your bag from take-off to landing, pushing on the seat in front of you, picking your nose, rubbing your hairy arms on the lady next to you, etc, makes the flight uncomfortable for your neighbor. A little conversation at the start of the flight doesn't hurt, but if it's not being wholeheartedly reciprocated and engaged in, leave your neighbor alone. A lot of people fly a few of times a week, and don't necessarily want to talk to everyone they fly with. Anecdote: On my last flight, I was seated next to a very hairy \"street punk\" who was not into deodorant at all. The fingerless-mittens type. After removing his shoes and socks, he promptly fell asleep and his hairy arm was in my seat. I kept pushing him out but he wasn't waking up. He was asleep facing me, with his barely-open eyes freaking me out, snoring and breathing wretched Frito-breath on me for 3 hours. Don't be that guy.\n\n10. If the fasten seatbelt sign is on, keep your seat unless you're literally going to shit your pants. \n\n11. Wear deodorant, brush your teeth, and wear clean clothes. No one likes to have someone smushed up against them that smells like they ate farts for breakfast and came to the airport straight from soccer practice.\n\n12. When you get to baggage claim, there should be digital signs that show the arriving flights for each carousel. You can find your flight and just hang out forever while your baggage arrives. There should also be an information desk if you get lost.\n\nAnyway, I try to do all these things to not only make my experience pleasant, but to make others' pleasant as well.

This can happen and if this happens they will make you check any larger carry on bags (for free) and they will either store them at the front of the plane or with all the other checked baggage.  Make sure you find out which, because if it is with the checked baggage you will need to make sure to grab it at baggage claim.\n\nWhat if they ask to search your carry on?  Last time I flew someone gave me a bag with some breakfast items to eat on the plane so I just threw it into my carry on and didnt realize they put a bottle of orange juice in that was over the limit.  So they pull me aside and tell me they have to check my bag.  No problem I knew I didnt have anything in there, just didnt know about the oj.  The security guy pulled the oj and asked if I wanted him to toss it or he could give it back to me to drink.  In the moment it threw me off and I was like, sure I'll just take it and drink it before I board.  He's like no, either I throw it away now, or I give it back to you and you go back outside the security area and drink it and come back through security.

Terminals change.\n\n2. As mentioned before, keep your ID on your person. Do not check it. I also never check my keys, but put them in my carry-on when I get out of my car.\n\n3. Most airport check-in kiosks ask for a confirmation number. I make sure I have the confirmation email for my flight queued up on my phone before I arrive, and I even screenshot it in case the whole internet goes down in the world.\n\n4. All liquids/gels have to be kept in a single 1L Ziploc bag together. Also I'm not sure what the size limit is on bottles but I had a bigger bottle of soap that fit easily in the 1L bag and they made me toss it, so I looked like an idiot. Best to stick with 'travel-size' or look up the bottle size limit. If your bag gets searched and you get pulled aside, you're probably not going to jail. I've been pulled out so they could flip through the pages of House of Leaves. Their scanners thought they picked something up.\n\n5. This is a little out of order, but I always text myself and screenshot where I parked...terminal, color of the lot, etc. That way when I land in terminal E but took off out of terminal A, I'm not walking around the terminal A lot looking for my car. After a few days you'll also have trouble googling the terminal that you left from because flight #s get recycled, so good thing you documented it! \n\n6. Your \"boarding group #\" should be on your printed boarding pass. They'll call your boarding group to board. If you line up as soon as they begin boarding and you're boarding group 5, you're going to be standing there with your stuff for an eternity. Everyone else will line up. Let them, and wait until your group # is actually called.\n\n7. When the plane stops after landing, everyone is going to stand up immediately, all uncomfortably, and stand there indefinitely. Just keep your seat and chill until the line moves. Don't dart out in front of the people in the seats in front of you. Wait your turn.\n\n8. Turbulence might cause the plane to jump around more than you feel comfortable with. You're probably not crashing.\n\n9. When in your seat, keep your arms to yourself, within the invisible box of the seat space that you purchased. Keep your damn shoes on. Don't breathe on your neighbor. Don't squirm a tremendous amount. Find an activity and stick with it for a while. If you have a carry-on that's small enough, you can put it under the seat in front of you. This is where you should've packed your ipod, gaming device, book, stuff you'll need in-flight. Digging around in your bag from take-off to landing, pushing on the seat in front of you, picking your nose, rubbing your hairy arms on the lady next to you, etc, makes the flight uncomfortable for your neighbor. A little conversation at the start of the flight doesn't hurt, but if it's not being wholeheartedly reciprocated and engaged in, leave your neighbor alone. A lot of people fly a few of times a week, and don't necessarily want to talk to everyone they fly with. Anecdote: On my last flight, I was seated next to a very hairy \"street punk\" who was not into deodorant at all. The fingerless-mittens type. After removing his shoes and socks, he promptly fell asleep and his hairy arm was in my seat. I kept pushing him out but he wasn't waking up. He was asleep facing me, with his barely-open eyes freaking me out, snoring and breathing wretched Frito-breath on me for 3 hours. Don't be that guy.\n\n10. If the fasten seatbelt sign is on, keep your seat unless you're literally going to shit your pants. \n\n11. Wear deodorant, brush your teeth, and wear clean clothes. No one likes to have someone smushed up against them that smells like they ate farts for breakfast and came to the airport straight from soccer practice.\n\n12. When you get to baggage claim, there should be digital signs that show the arriving flights for each carousel. You can find your flight and just hang out forever while your baggage arrives. There should also be an information desk if you get lost.\n\nAnyway, I try to do all these things to not only make my experience pleasant, but to make others' pleasant as well. Traveling is not that stressful overall, but it makes traveling especially comfortable if you do a few things before heading out to make future-you more relaxed!", "id": "da01skc"}, {"comment": "> Also I'm not sure what the size limit is on bottles but I had a bigger bottle of soap that fit easily in the 1L bag and they made me toss it, so I looked like an idiot.\n\nIt's 3oz.

This can happen and if this happens they will make you check any larger carry on bags (for free) and they will either store them at the front of the plane or with all the other checked baggage.  Make sure you find out which, because if it is with the checked baggage you will need to make sure to grab it at baggage claim.\n\nWhat if they ask to search your carry on?  Last time I flew someone gave me a bag with some breakfast items to eat on the plane so I just threw it into my carry on and didnt realize they put a bottle of orange juice in that was over the limit.  So they pull me aside and tell me they have to check my bag.  No problem I knew I didnt have anything in there, just didnt know about the oj.  The security guy pulled the oj and asked if I wanted him to toss it or he could give it back to me to drink.  In the moment it threw me off and I was like, sure I'll just take it and drink it before I board.

Similarly, I'm a man exclusively attracted to females and no amount of brainwashing can change my form of attraction. If I were gay or bisexual, it wouldn't change either. You simply can't change what you are attracted to. \n\nIf someone can fathom that \"choice\" can exist in this realm, they are at the very least bisexual for they think there naturally is a choice to be made; which is the point of OP's linked post.

Here's a great hypothesis that hopefully builds on Laminar_flo's point.\n\nThere is a very good reason you should never, ever, EVER, base your money of a material good be it gold, oil, or Beanie Babies. Up until the late 1800's aluminium was significantly more expensive than gold. By such a large margin that it was almost invaluable. It was stored near crown jewels in some countries.\n\n Now imagine you're a government that fancies yourself new and progressive. You're all \"we should base our economy on this very difficult to obtain material\". Since it was incredibly difficult to produce the price wouldn't fluctuate all that much since at the time it was a simply understood fact that aluminium was near impossibly to produce in quantities large enough to create a boom-bust bubble.\n\n Your economy is happily strumming along, your dollar is stable because it's based on this very expensive metal. Mind you it's only expensive because people agree that it's expensive. No one had found any genuinely good uses for it by then other than making ingots and silverware out of it and then pointing and saying \"oooo shiny\". Anyway, you're the proud government papa of some nice stable currency. Then one day two scientists, Paul Lois Toussaint H\u00e9roult and Charles Martin Hall, walk up to you and punch you in the stomach. They don't ask you to prepare yourself or anything they just up and cold cock you.\n\n How do they do this you ask? They invent a way to produce aluminium at such a cheap rate that it goes from being the most expensive metal on earth to one we wrap gum in now. They in one fell swoop destroyed the entire substructure of what you based your money on. You got black swanned because you thought you were impervious to change. The aluminium dollar would be valuable forever you said. It's the rarest metal on earth you said. I'll let you in on a little secret, mother nature gives two dog fucks about your sense of stability. She up ended the entire basis of your economy by simply introducing more of an element than you knew was there. You based your economy in a mineral lottery. *golf clap* You're an idiot.\n\nSo imagine we were still on the gold standard and Russia/China/North Korea/Insert country we currently think are assholes suddenly finds a way to produce or refine said material in a new way that makes that material so abundant I have some covering my Thanksgiving leftovers. Without having to send a single troop over or do more than have to haul a bunch of dirt into a refinery they destroyed the value of our money and we are now Zimbabwe.\n\nTL:DR I use a lot of hyperbole and conjecture to say you shouldn't base your economy on material things because material things can be produced in large quantities and break the basis of your economy.", "id": "dakixqs"}, {"comment": "Also, there's the environment factor.

You have zero understanding of what you're talking about. \n\nEDIT: to expand on this a little bit.  The 'other' side of the US physical good trade imbalance is our positive international capital flow.  Capital is the 'Ying' to the 'Yang' that are globally traded physical goods - they (roughly) counter balance each other.  The UST/Fed reserves the right to change our monetary supply and interest rate base by using such policy tools as rate setting, reserve setting, open market activities, etc.  **The UST/Fed does this to optimize the US currency base to best reflect the US economy's needs - full stop (any politician/economist that says otherwise is utterly full of shit).**\n\nIf we were to gold-back our currency we effectively lose the ability to optimize the US currency base to best reflect the US economies needs.  In fact, it hands the ability to influence the US capital/monetary base to any country that has a trade/capital surplus to purchase/sell gold to manipulate the US economy to their own ends.  In fact, this happened in the 1960s, accidentally, which was a major precipitating event in the full abandonment of the USD/gold relationship.  \n\nReally, the only people that still back a gold standard are the same people that don't understand the role debt plays in global financial markets.

I'm mostly trying to demistify the partial myth of the unknown greedy millionaire\"\n\nThe largest U.S. health insurance company \"united health group\" 1.6 percent of the stock is owned by people in the company. Almost 90 percent is institutional investors the remaining are personal investors. Those institutional funds are either public or private. If you have a retirement account, pension, ira, 401k, 403b, 457b, etc and have holdings in large caps then you are the shareholder along with everyone else in the fund. The mutual fund or other investment vehicle is doing their legal job trying to get the best performance out of that company as possible as it's required they do so, all to make money for your retirement account. If they underperform your plan manager and fiduciary will kick the fund and potentially cost that fund millions to billions. Institutional ownership of the market is well over 50 percent and I've seen some say it's over 90 percent. They manage the fund, it's mostly pension money and other retirement accounts that are buying the shares, btw that's any one who contributes to that retirement account. Those unknown evil greedy millionairs could barely ripple a penny stock, but a fund like fidelity magellen in the late 90s could influence the whole market. Before you blame a faceless group of individuals which mostly don't exist or their existence is make sure they follow their objectives of making sure they follow their legal requirements. Think of it like a grocery store if the grocery store had a company they contacted to that kept sending them bad fruit wouldn't they be wise to drop that vendor, our if they had an excellent vegatable supplier would they not continue our expand the relationship. That's how your retirement plan should work, and if they perform poorly they can be sued and many fiduciaries and plans have been.

My problem is not that the company positions are ALSO held by large retirement groups and institutions as well as hedge funds catering to the wealthy.\n\nMy problem is that these private health insurers contribute NOTHING to increasing the quality or usefulness of the healthcare you're provided, but rake off huge portions of profit from the people they insure, to the tune of billions of dollars a year - think about it - all they do is aggregate risk, which the government could do just fine without the hundreds of billions of dollars of profit every year - and yet they're one of the biggest industries within healthcare.\n\nThe whole private health insurance industry is an industry designed to take money from anybody who needs healthcare (which is everybody in the country) and take a huge slice of it to give to their shareholders and owners while contributing nothing of value back. Its basically a form of redistributing wealth into the rich.\n\nThese companies earn almost all their money by denying claims, preventing the sick/elderly from entering their client base, and otherwise undesirable behavior. It got so bad that the government recently had to cap their earnings at 10% because otherwise they had incentive to do even MORE horrible things to increase their bottom line. \n\nThink about it. They had to cap earnings at 10% because otherwise this set of private insurers, who contribute exactly nothing medicare couldn't do in their place, and take off huge portions of money in the process, would take TOO much personal profit for their own.\n\nIt's just a completely messed up set of incentives when the primary determinant of whether or not you get good healthcare has huge incentive to underpay or just not pay at all for your care.", "id": "damsfth"}, {"comment": "     I will stick with United Health Care as it is the largest. though I'm not arguing that there are serious issues with the health care industry.

That being said here are some reasons why your reasoning is flawed. \n\n As for your first like, it's not \"also\" owned by, it's a VASTLY and almost TOTALY owned by funds and that are NOT just for the \"wealthy\" (like they are all evil or some sort of disease) for instance here is the morning star page for united health showing its top owners http://investors.morningstar.com/ownership/shareholders-major.html?t=UNH&region=usa&culture=en-US&ownerCountry=USA The top owner of that company is Virginia's 529 plan fund (all those fund begining with VA are all differnce fund for the 529 plan of virginia) Which is a state run savings plan for college that people can set up for their kids or other peoples kids! Those vanguard funds are focused for retirement plans and pension plans, the trow price also sold to retirement plans and IRAs, same with fidelity, the spdr (spider) are for anyone to invest in with very low cost and fees like something you would buy in an etrade account designed for value investors yeah you know the normal person just trying to save a little. The Fidelity Contra fund is one of the most popular fund for retirement accounts. Also you know who's most likely to hold shares of companies that offer dividends to share holders? The elderly (retirement accounts) that need to generate income at lower tax rates than other sources of income because the elderly generally don't have jobs. They are also generally seen as having lower volatility which also attracts the lower risk investors. Yes some wealthy people will do it to so they can earn dividends     \n\n(Also how exactly do they give this wild excess of income to the shareholders [which ahem... are the owners {unless you can find a sole proprietor health insurance company, which i highly doubt}]) \n\nI disagree that they just are raking in all the money because as you will see they are not, as shown by this article and some more to follow.\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2016/01/19/unitedhealth-q4-profit-falls-says-obamacare-one-factor/78996198/\nit's revenue was 157 billion it's actual income was between 5.8 (wikipedia) and 6.8 billion (usatoday) and that is hardly raking in the percentage profit at just over 4%\n\nor this forbs article\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/liyanchen/2015/09/23/the-most-profitable-industries-in-2015/#18e5fb4e7712\nHealth insurance is not in health technology its in health services there at the bottom of the list. It may be dependable earnings but it's not blowing doors off. high revenues are great, but you can always spend more than you can earn and that doesn't mean your company is doing well. Also have you ever though the reason that they do some of those horrible things is because their margins are so low and they are playing a tight game and they play hardball on who they have to pay.  \n\nThings you are missing is looking at absolute amount like billions those are great but you cannot compare individual numbers, you need to make ratios/percentages otherwise you are going to miss the scope. like back with stocks would like like a 1$ increase in a $10 stock or a $10 increase in a $100 stock the proportions are the same you'r increase is proportionally the same at 10%. Also the over health insurance market was somewhere in the 800 billion in revenue for 2015 if the industry avg 4% (forbs says 3.8%) so 800bil x .04 = 32 billion.  That's less than apple which only had 215 billion in revenue and 45 billion in income and apple is just one company so ouch... So there is a resounding nope on your the cap was needed and or good cause they are not even close to hitting it. \n\nOne other point is say that private heath care companies are eliminated, they employ over 500,000 people in the USA and many if not most of those jobs are not minimum wage positions. So what will happen if we have to lay all those people off. Which should lead to the dawning idea of hey... why was the ACA written in a way to make sure insurance companies stuck around. Because if you cut them out, it would drop a cost and that by estimations would increase savings, but then you have half a million wage earners sitting on ass collecting unemployment covered by the government and you would have to be the president or  congress that closed and entire industry not an overwhelmingly popular things to do, besides it would kill some major US cities and those states would be none to happy. \n\nYou are not wrong to be upset, but your arguments are unfounded, very weak and show a lack of understanding of the issue. There is massive shadyness in the USA health care system.

So the physician doesn't actually charge the patient themselves, they charge the insurance and expect to get reimbursed. So the physician basically has their fee which is for effort and time, and this gets combined with the facility fee for time, material, effort, etc. Medical billing is super complex and highly regulated (making it more Byzantine) so in some sense this is charging for time and materials.

Crime was up both in absolute numbers and on a per capita basis. Only in the last 10 years, the crime rates have (very slowly) been falling again.

In fact, a major economic argument against immigration in the case of the Netherlands is that welfare for immigrants account for 45% of the total welfare budget, even though immigrants constitute a relatively tiny portion of the Dutch population. 3% of native Dutchmen are on welfare, while it is just a little bit over 20% for immigrants.

Which I think is also UBI's biggest hurdle to getting implemented. The problem that I think most people have with UBI is they think it's not fair to take money from some people and give it to other people. Of course, that's exactly what's happening with Social Security and mortgage interest tax credit and the capital gains tax and the tax break on charitable gifts. We think there are situations where asking some people to pay more so other people can pay less is a good choice for the country, and it seems if we make that tradeoff complicated enough people are fine with it, but when it's simple it doesn't seem \"fair\".\n\nSo, I think everyone just needs to answer this simple question:\n\n* If you're a citizen of the United States should you be guarenteed that you can survive in this country.\n\nAnd I think overwhelmingly we say yes. We don't want people starving to death or freezing to death or dying from lack of simple medical care. We've created a society where everyone needs some money to survive, and because of bad luck sometimes people don't have the bare minimum amount to just live. So we've made a patch work system of unemployment and social security and food stamps and heating assistance and we'll pay for you if you have to go to the emergency room and dozens of other programs to protect people when they have a string of bad luck.\n\nWhy do all that? We've created a country where everyone needs to have at least some money every month to just survive. This is a country that works great for lots of people and it's possible to make a lot of money and mostly things run pretty efficiently. Why not just say \"this is the minimum needed to survive, we'll guarantee everyone gets at least that much\" and then everyone can make their own choices about what's the best thing to do with their lives."], [9, "I want to expand on the point about wages going up or down.\n\nThink about a job you hate(d) doing. For me it would be a data entry job I did. Basically adjusting prices in a company database and it was super tedious and mind numbing. In a UBI world, I would need to be paid *at least* double to do the job. When I don't have as much need for wages I can be more selective with my time.\n\nNow think about the job you would love to have. For me that would be a physical therapist or other rehabilitation specialist. In a UBI world I would be a PT for as little as it cost me for food and transportation. Let's say it's 10 bucks for lunch and 5 bucks for transportation, I would be a physical therapist for $15/day because the job *is* the reward.\n\nSo basically the \"fun\" jobs would have low wages due to high demand while the tedious jobs would have higher wages due to low demand.

But the real median income right now sits at 30k meaning his equation makes for people who are at the 50k mark pay 8% extra in taxes.\n\n6000(1/30000-1/50000)=0.08\n\nBut realistically you're saying that you can live off of 6k a year which half of minimum wage which people already say isn't a living wage. So it should be at least minimum wage or 15k. Making that adjustment means those making 50k will pay 20% in taxes. \n\nBut that doesn't do a good job of tell you if it's paid for. Social security is UBI for old people. It makes up 18% of our population and our taxes make up 6.2% with another 6.2% paid by businesses. So to make SS available for everyone we estimate we need to cover 5.3x the people with means 5.3x the revenue. That means our contribution needs to increase 5.3x. we need to pay 30% and companies need to pay another 30% to fund it! That's makes sense because SS is already calculated for income variations and is built into the system with a progressive tax system. Medicare and other things still need to be paid.

They couldnt save it, they would just have to pay more for what they already have."], [4, "/u/alschei needs to learn a little more math.\n\nThere is more than one problem here:\n\n1) An arithmetic issue - The failure to recognize that there is a mathematical upper limit on total tax rates of 100%, and there is only so much money to go around,\n\n2) A failure to understand tax returns - there are only 96.5 million returns with tax liability, an additional 52 million without liability, and 320 million people total.\n\n**1) Math Fail**\n\nData [here, the IRS website (using 2014 data)](https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-statistical-tables-by-size-of-adjusted-gross-income).\n\nIt is a relatively simple matter to take the spreadsheet and plug in the numbers above for each income bracket. Note that \"taxpayers\" in this instance are a mere 96 million returns out of 320 million people, with an additional 52 million non-tax-paying filers.\n\nThe average income for taxpayers (not filers!) is $70,932, not $75,000. Let's set a = $70,932.\n\nSo, taking a step back, that would mean that every taxpayer would get $70,932, and on top of that pay the taxes they pay now plus some additional rate.\n\nFor 96 mm returns, that's a total of $6.8 trillion. Current after-tax income total is only $5.4 trillion. There is literally not enough after-tax income to fund this level for everyone. The equation does not demonstrate the flaw in this because it allows total tax rates to go up above 100%.\n\nThe hard limit for a is therefore $56,658, and in that scenario, 100% of everyone's income goes to the government. Anyone currently making less that that amount comes out ahead of their current situation, of course.\n\nAnother curious facet of the situation is that the burden is hardest on those who have the highest tax RATES. That's the $2mm to $5mm income range people. After taxes AND UBI, there net income averages $19,175. Do the math (in a spreadsheet).\n\nObviously, this situation wouldn't last long enough to make it to the first tax return. Anyone making over the $200,000-$500K range would forgo income. This would have a cascading effect as the burden would fall more heavily on those people, upping their UBI required additional tax to the point where it nets to negative. The burden would then fall on the next lowest tax bracket, etc.\n\n**2) Tax returns Fail**\n\nThe situation is worse than that, since this assumes that the only participants here are the 92 mm taxable filers. There are an additional 52 mm who filed but paid no taxes, who would presumably be eligible for UBI as well. On top of that, if your gross income was less than a certain level (about $10,000 - $20,000 I believe), you don't need to file at all; but presumable these people would also be eligible. Further, those 148 mm returns include joint and head-of-household returns, meaning that the required amount of UBI would be a lot higher than 148 mm times \"a.\"\n\n**3) Incentives Fail**\nWork is hard and stressful and most of us would rather be doing something else. A \"study\" isn't needed to understand that there would be a large number of people who wouldn't work, or wouldn't work nearly as much, under UBI. This was the entire point of welfare reform in the '90's - to increase the incentive for people to work. And indeed, the unemployment rate went permanently to a lower base-case level (obviously still fluctuating due to recessions).\n\nFurther, this ignores what's called the marginal tax rate, i.e. the total taxes and loss of benefit you incur for each additional dollar you earn. At a = $56,000, this is 64% in the $15,000 - $20,000 bucket. It goes down to 52% in the next bracket and then pops back up and keeps going. There are few people who will bother to work hard enough to earn that when they effectively have half or two thirds taken away in taxes.\n\n/u/alschei spent a lot of time setting up equations and no time looking at the actual numbers, nor thinking about the incentives. UBI is a completely unworkable because it sets up a bad set of incentives and punishes the hell out of people who do earn more. As those people respond to those incentives (by not earning as much), the system collapses. In this case the numbers are so severe that the system would collapse before the first year the policy was implemented."], [2, "$6,000 a year doesn't nearly cover living expenses and most certainly isn't enough to raise a child on.

Means-testing necessarily means that some people who deserve support won't receive it, either through ignorance or errors. Means-testing is also expensive to implement, reducing the efficiency of welfare. Most welfare programs drop off in large steps, which amounts to a high marginal tax rate for the poorest earners. Requiring work for benefits forces people into jobs inflates the labor supply, reducing the wages to that same labor. Special types of benefits, such as funds that can only be used for specific purposes, also distorts the relevant markets.\n\nWith a UBI, minimum wage jobs have to compete with the option of going without a job, driving up the lowest wages.

Have any evidence to suggest that poor people are, typically, so bad with money that if we gave them more economic power that it would not do anything to help them? And this is really the problem with the whole thing. We are basing our ideas around what would happen under UBI around toxic truisms, despite the fact that we should already be aware of how false truisms are used to justify incredibly disastrous policy. Giving people more money means that they have more purchasing power, because that is how money works. If some poor people are so poor now that they are living in massive debt then yes, those people will still be exploited in the sense that The UBI would simply go to feed that debt, and not them directly, and that would require something more to achieve. But remember, that once there is a UBI, that resets the standards for how hard it is to get into really bad debt, as well as how hard it is to pay off debt, because now you get this big chunk of money that will protect from going into debt. Being poor isn't expensive just because poor people are particularly stupid. It is because the market is structured in such a way where you lose significant amounts of autonomy when you are poor. When you are poor, you have to spend money on one meal at a time, rather than getting enough for several meals at a lower price. Because when you make shit money, it doesn't matter how much you know buying in bulk is better, YOU DON'T HAVE THE FUCKING MONEY TO DO IT. Rich people and middle class people have the ultimate luxury of being able to take a livable lifestyle for granted, especially for rich people, who only ever really 'need' to spend a fraction of their money for what is still a lavish lifestyle. Obviously then they could TOTALLY live on a poor persons salary because they know how to manage money. No, they would never have to sacrifice economics of scale to buy enough to make it through the day. They would NEVER have to resort to buy clothes that will just fall apart soon because they had to make the choice between good clothes and bad clothes and going to the dentist. And that is the fundamental reason why I think UBI would work, in the end. Poor people generally aren't retarded, but they live in a society where money buys autonomy. And if a UBI were introduced, one tied to an actual percentage of GDP so it couldn't just be priced into irrelevancy, then everyone would necessarily have more economic power, BY DEFINITION. Which would mean that now poor people actually have the money needed to actually make those good decisions in the first place, rather than never actually having a choice in the first place, despite what many if not most people seem to believe.

Note that \"taxpayers\" in this instance are a mere 96 million returns out of 320 million people, with an additional 52 million non-tax-paying filers.\n\nThe average income for taxpayers (not filers!) is $70,932, not $75,000. Let's set a = $70,932.\n\nSo, taking a step back, that would mean that every taxpayer would get $70,932, and on top of that pay the taxes they pay now plus some additional rate.\n\nFor 96 mm returns, that's a total of $6.8 trillion. Current after-tax income total is only $5.4 trillion. There is literally not enough after-tax income to fund this level for everyone. The equation does not demonstrate the flaw in this because it allows total tax rates to go up above 100%.\n\nThe hard limit for a is therefore $56,658, and in that scenario, 100% of everyone's income goes to the government. Anyone currently making less that that amount comes out ahead of their current situation, of course.\n\nAnother curious facet of the situation is that the burden is hardest on those who have the highest tax RATES. That's the $2mm to $5mm income range people. After taxes AND UBI, there net income averages $19,175. Do the math (in a spreadsheet).\n\nObviously, this situation wouldn't last long enough to make it to the first tax return. Anyone making over the $200,000-$500K range would forgo income. This would have a cascading effect as the burden would fall more heavily on those people, upping their UBI required additional tax to the point where it nets to negative. The burden would then fall on the next lowest tax bracket, etc.\n\n**2) Tax returns Fail**\n\nThe situation is worse than that, since this assumes that the only participants here are the 92 mm taxable filers. There are an additional 52 mm who filed but paid no taxes, who would presumably be eligible for UBI as well. On top of that, if your gross income was less than a certain level (about $10,000 - $20,000 I believe), you don't need to file at all; but presumable these people would also be eligible. Further, those 148 mm returns include joint and head-of-household returns, meaning that the required amount of UBI would be a lot higher than 148 mm times \"a.\"\n\n**3) Incentives Fail**\nWork is hard and stressful and most of us would rather be doing something else. A \"study\" isn't needed to understand that there would be a large number of people who wouldn't work, or wouldn't work nearly as much, under UBI. This was the entire point of welfare reform in the '90's - to increase the incentive for people to work.

At a = $56,000, this is 64% in the $15,000 - $20,000 bucket. It goes down to 52% in the next bracket and then pops back up and keeps going.

UBI is a completely unworkable because it sets up a bad set of incentives and punishes the hell out of people who do earn more. As those people respond to those incentives (by not earning as much), the system collapses.

They\u2019ll recruit a team\u2019s worth of engineers, give them visas that allow them to stay here long enough to finish a project, house them in cheap hotels, pay them a fraction of what a U.S. engineer would be paid, and then ship them home after the project is done. \n\nThe scare over \u201cillegal immigration\u201d boils down to the insecurity felt by white America. When that statistic came out a few years ago that by 2050, the majority of the country will not look white, it sent white America into an identity crisis. Though it\u2019s never mentioned on the right for obvious reasons, and the more liberal media would prefer to be less inflammatory about it, a vast number of white people think that America is a fundamentally white place. Most are fine with a non-white majority, but once that\u2019s threatened, that\u2019s when the more overt xenophobia begins to rear its head. This election marks something of a watershed moment in this respect. \n\nAnd to address the idea that countries should be able to control their own borders: that\u2019s all fine and dandy in theory, but the problem is that we live in a globalized world, where the \u201cdomestic\u201d decisions a country makes about its economy or international trade have tangible effects on other countries. The reason there has been an increase in undocumented immigration at the southern border has more to do with NAFTA and the deprivation of developing countries ability to provide livable wages due to the influx of foreign capital investments. Consider how when America was rapidly developing its industrial economy during the first part of the twentieth century, the factory workers were given an equitable share of the growing profits of the steel and auto companies. That\u2019s not the case anymore for  less developed countries. Mexico, for instance, doesn\u2019t have an auto or steel industry to develop, because US companies can just build plants in the NAFTA free-trade zone (technically within Mexico\u2019s borders) but pay them far less than they\u2019d have to if they were American workers. \n\nAll this was especially true about twenty years ago.

These people want to come here, work here, pay taxes here... I would *love* to end world hunger, but our government has no jurisdiction in other nations. My solutions all involve the more effective movement of goods. I don't know whether they'd require state action or if private enterprise can do it. Either way, this comes back to the inhumanity/futility of basing our immigration policy around the effects on *some other nation* of its own brain drain. If an economically mobile, driven person wants to relocate to a place where their resources don't go nearly as far, they're *probably* not about to make a buck where they've just left, you know? It's not something we can address through policy, and it's not something we can presume to fix for another nation.\n\n* Automation spells the death of unskilled labor, and even a lot of skilled labor.

A society which can only offer steady work to 40% of its citizens has to rethink what \"pulling your weight\" means.

The Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), the body of law governing current immigration policy, provides for an **annual worldwide limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants, with certain exceptions for close family members**...\n\n> In order to balance the overall number of immigrants arriving based on family relationships, Congress established a complicated system for calculating the available number of family preference visas for any given year. The number is determined by starting with 480,000 and then subtracting the number of immediate relative visas issued during the previous year and the number of aliens \u201cparoled\u201d into the U.S. during the previous year. Any unused employment preference immigrant numbers from the preceding year are then added to this sum to establish the number of visas that remain for allocation through the preference system. However, by law, the number of family-based visas allocated through the preference system may not be lower than 226,000. In reality, due to large numbers of immediate relatives, the actual number of preference system visas available each year has been 226,000. Consequently, the total number of family-based visas often exceeds 480,000. \n\n> **In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014, family-based immigrants comprised 64 percent of all new LPRs in the United States...**\n\n> The overall numerical limit for permanent employment-based immigrants is 140,000 per year...\n\n> **In FY 2014, immigrants admitted through the employment preferences made up 15 percent of all new LPRs in the United States.**\n\n> **The Diversity Visa lottery was created by the Immigration Act of 1990 as a dedicated channel for immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.** Each year 55,000 visas are allocated randomly to nationals from countries that have sent less than 50,000 immigrants to the United States in the previous 5 years. Of the 55,000, up to 5,000 are made available for use under the NACARA program. This results in a reduction of the actual annual limit to 50,000.\n\n> Although originally intended to favor immigration from Ireland (during the first three years of the program at least 40 percent of the visas were exclusively allocated to Irish immigrants),** the Diversity Visa program has become one of the only avenues for individuals from certain regions in the world to secure a green card.**\n\n> To be eligible for a diversity visa, an immigrant must have a high-school education (or its equivalent) or have, within the past five years, a minimum of two years working in a profession requiring at least two years of training or experience. Spouses and minor unmarried children of the principal applicant may also enter as dependents.\n\nThen there's a lottery. A goddamn lottery.\n\nSo. Family preference accounts for 64% of new LPRs. Employment preference accounts for a further 15%. There is a ceiling on total refugee admission (which is fucked up just on the face of it) which clogs up other avenues for admission. So for sure, **no more than 21% of permanent residents admitted each year are \"economic migrants\"** and you can be sure most of *those* are middle-class.\n\n11% of 675,000 comes to 141,750 economic migrants per year (edit: including the 55k from the Diversity Visa lottery, **which means only 91.7k who just applied for entry to seek a better life are actually granted their request each year.**)\n\n---\n\nWe let 140,000 people move here each year who \"just\" want to start a new life in America. 3 million come here illegally in the same timespan.

At the time America was disentangling herself from Iraq, the Shi'ite Maliki regime in Baghdad was systematically purging Sunni politicians from its ranks, often violently. Peaceful protests in response to Sunni statesmen being arrested were suppressed violently. Meanwhile, Shia death squads targeted Sunni civilians; every couple of days a new gaggle of sectarian murder victims popped up in Baghdad as the Shia militias took revenge for all the car bombs and suicide attacks over the last 10 years. And any Sunni civilian who turned to the police for protection found out- surprise!- the same Shia gunman who assassinated civilians at night wore a cop uniform in the day. So there is a very real sense among Sunni in the north west of Iraq that their government was not merely suppressing their rights and barring them from employment, it was actively targeting them in a religious genocide. In an environment like that, signing on with an outfit like Daesh could be considered the most effective way to fight back and keep your neighborhood safe from policemen and soldiers representing the illegitimate government.\n\nSimilar circumstances apply to Sunnis in Syria.\n\nThe ones I really despise and loathe are Daesh's foreign volunteers, the Saudis and Frenchmen and Tunisians and Australians and so on who see the snuff films and hop on a plane to get some of that action.

I do think there should be background checks (and I am about to gladly go through one) and that the country is slowly getting into military grade weaponry, both in our police force and at home, but I have no issue with owning a gun.  I think we're well past the point where we could logistically take everyone's guns away anyway.  It'd be like deporting every illegal immigrant in the country.", "id": "d9vhkcn"}, {"comment": "A couple things that should be a sticky and on the sidebar of /r/guns and maybe domestic violence subreddits.\n\nFirst, guns are the absolute last resort.  The only time to touch a gun is if you know you are about to die.  The short of this is because you don't want to escalate a situation, and, contrary to what /r/guns will tell you, obviously a gun is much more dangerous for a less strong woman or old person to use in self defense because of the danger of it being taken away from you and the nature of crime being that the attacker/criminal will always have a huge, enormous advantage.  Also, if you point a gun at a criminal that turns you into a deadly threat to them.  That is the last thing you want.\n\nTake a serious self defense course.  It should be a several week course.  The course doesn't teach you how to hold a gun or shoot a gun, the course teaches you how to protect yourself through preparation, through awareness, and the right tactics to respond to different threats.\n\nGoing to a gun range isn't going to teach you any of that.  Ignore every guy that tells you \"just buy a gun and I'll show you how to shoot on a range\" or anything like that.  It's good to familiarize yourself with a gun, so that you would feel confident if someone ran up to you and said \"You have to shoot that target 10 yards away right now or something bad will happen.\" and then you can take out your gun, point at a paper target 10 yards away and shoot without having any trouble.\n\nGun wise, it basically doesn't matter what gun you use.  Guns kill.  That's the bottom line.  Arguments about which gun is more deadly or whatever are all pretty stupid.\n\nThe most important thing is to find a gun that's comfortable in your hand and that's comfortable to shoot.\n\nThen the next important thing is that it's easy to conceal.\n\nYou might try a classic .38 special, or a small \"compact\" 9mm.  Something like a glock g-43.\n\nhttps://us.glock.com/products/model/g43\n\nhttp://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2015/01/top-13-snub-nose-revolvers/#armscor-model-206-spurless\n\nOne of the things you'll probably learn in the self defense class is stuff like how unless you live in a violent neighborhood, your biggest threat is people you know.\n\nTake, for instance, domestic violence.  The last thing you want to do if you're in a bad domestic situation is to bring a gun into it.  The best thing to do is to get out of that bad domestic situation.\n\nTelling someone in a bad domestic situation to \"just get a gun\" is terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible advice.  I can't stress enough how terrible that advice is.\n\nPretty much all advice you get on the internet about guns is terrible advice that will just make things more dangerous.\n\nA gun isn't going to help you if you get date raped even though reddit will tell you it will.\n\nA gun isn't going to help you with an abusive partner even though reddit will tell you it will.\n\nIf you have a stalker, talk to people, talk to the police.  Maybe your best bet is to move if you can.  Maybe the best thing for you to do in your situation is to get a gun.  But getting a gun if you have a stalker is just banking on your stalker basically opening himself up to getting shot by you by trying to break down your door or something, rather than doing something else, like just waiting in a bush and attacking you or something.  So it's not like getting a gun is the perfect answer to a stalker or anything.\n\nAnd of course, read up on gun safety and safe gun storage.\n\nAnother thing that /r/guns won't tell you is that ~300,000 guns are \"stolen\" every year.  Your gun isn't going to do anything if, like 99% of the time, a burglar breaks into your place when you aren't there.  It's just another $100 for them when they sell the stuff they stole from you.\n\nThe sad truth is that guns are more of a safety blanket than anything else, particularly to women.  They offer more of an illusion of safety than actual safety, and, often, they put you in more danger, rather than less, particularly if you misuse it.", "id": "d9wa2yo"}, {"comment": "This is all a good perspective.  Rest assured I have no illusions about a gun ever being necessary or protecting me.  As you said, it's basically a safety blanket.

There's a desire to meet people outside of my bubble - I have run into several one issue gun voters and I quite frankly do not have a strong opinion on guns because I am ignorant.  I see mass shootings and that's a problem, but neither side is offering up real solutions.  Finally, my perception of Trump voters this election, true or not, has at least an element of viewing them as gun owners, who don't care about people like me, who want to throw a brick through the window because they are so pissed off.  I know that's not the full story, but it is an unsettling feeling.  I logically know that purchasing a gun will not help with a threat, that frankly, likely does not exist, but I was trying to say that I empathize with the feeling of unease.

It wasnt even that the labor was quality though, it was that the product was more innovative. In the beginning of the industrial revolution we began building factories, putting out better quality product for cheaper. Sure, the English invented the powered factory and Germans invented the car, No one could compete with Henry Ford's model T, produced on an Assembly Line.\n\nSo what do we bring to the table now? We still build a lot of cars, but American cars lag behind German and Japanese cars in almost all aspects. The factories are less modern, the labor is slower and slopier, the designs and method are reactionary.\n\nIt aggrevates me to see so many German car factories in the US: we are like Chinese labor for the Germans. German labor is so expensive because of labor laws that they export their labor just like we do, except that the US is somewhere between Germany and China; we're cheaper than Germany but not as crappy as China. Every time an American politician talks about bringing in factories it irks me. We just cant compete in the labor market anymore, and more shitty factory jobs only sorta satiates our need to work.\n\nLook instead at the markets that do make us money: advanced tech jobs. Green energy, super modern factories and products like Tesla and Apple and Google. Thats our export powerhouse. We could never make up our trade defecit by making more Callahan Auto brakepads. The rest of the world caught up to the late 80's American product and factory and now they'll win on price every time. We cant compete and we cant solve the deficit just by trade tariffs either.\n\nWe got here by innovating. We have to do the same thing we've been doing; not by making brake pads in a factory but by innovating. Always being ahead of the curve. Thats the magic. We need education like never before because innovating takes more research and more brainpower. The reason humans didnt invent the Hadron partical collider around the same time as the wheel is because all of those technologies that were invented before the collider took less resources and knowledge. Every step forward now is larger, more expensive, and requires better labor than the previous. Each step is exponentially bigger.\n\nAs an engineer and salesman who sells the top-of-the line factory automation product, I can tell you that the majority of the American workforce is not capable of innovating. They dont undstand the benefits of thr new solution and they are too stupid, old, and stubborn to believe that what they're doing now is antequated and ineffective for the new product.

It wasnt even that the labor was quality though, it was that the product was more innovative. In the beginning of the industrial revolution we began building factories, putting out better quality product for cheaper. Sure, the English invented the powered factory and Germans invented the car, No one could compete with Henry Ford's model T, produced on an Assembly Line.\n\nSo what do we bring to the table now? We still build a lot of cars, but American cars lag behind German and Japanese cars in almost all aspects. The factories are less modern, the labor is slower and slopier, the designs and method are reactionary.\n\nIt aggrevates me to see so many German car factories in the US: we are like Chinese labor for the Germans. German labor is so expensive because of labor laws that they export their labor just like we do, except that the US is somewhere between Germany and China; we're cheaper than Germany but not as crappy as China. Every time an American politician talks about bringing in factories it irks me. We just cant compete in the labor market anymore, and more shitty factory jobs only sorta satiates our need to work.\n\nLook instead at the markets that do make us money: advanced tech jobs. Green energy, super modern factories and products like Tesla and Apple and Google. Thats our export powerhouse. We could never make up our trade defecit by making more Callahan Auto brakepads. The rest of the world caught up to the late 80's American product and factory and now they'll win on price every time. We cant compete and we cant solve the deficit just by trade tariffs either.\n\nWe got here by innovating. We have to do the same thing we've been doing; not by making brake pads in a factory but by innovating. Always being ahead of the curve. Thats the magic. We need education like never before because innovating takes more research and more brainpower. The reason humans didnt invent the Hadron partical collider around the same time as the wheel is because all of those technologies that were invented before the collider took less resources and knowledge. Every step forward now is larger, more expensive, and requires better labor than the previous. Each step is exponentially bigger.\n\nAs an engineer and salesman who sells the top-of-the line factory automation product, I can tell you that the majority of the American workforce is not capable of innovating.

The alternative is basically doing shit like farm subsidies which everyone in the US excluding farmers is kind of scractching their head about. But honestly, can you even explain exactly what that means? how should the gov prevent wages from sinking? From forcing companies to higher min wages? Except that only like 2% of the US workforce of prime working age works at the min wage? The point is that it's so vague that you get to play madlib with this sentence, inserting whatever you think is a pressing problem without actually thinking about whether or not the sentence even said that. it just says, \"things are going to be kind of bad for this group.\" which we can say for just about anybody in this environment.  \n\nMore importantly though, the quality of a prediction isn't really the prediction itself, but how you come to that prediction. Let's take extreme examples: Nate silver is considered amazing because we assume that he uses math to predict things. Paul the octopus predicted the world cup. but nobody gives a shit about it except as a novelty because the process is basically a coin toss. In this case, we see the prediction, but have no idea how he came to it.\n\nAlso, the other half of the prediction about the gains of minorities and homosexuals in the past fourty years being taken back are laughably bad. he wrote this in 1998 according to OP. Which means 40 years ago was 1958. 1958 is literally before the civil rights act. That's not to mention that no one reveled in genuine racism outside of actual hate groups this cycle. And while i'm no trump supporter, it is absolutely worth noting that trump himself denounced some KKK groups and the house majority leader had to denounce one of his actions as ,\"a textbook example of a racism.\" Which is a huge step forward from 1958.\n\nAdditionally, jocular comments about women were a thing even among bernie supoprters. so it's not like trump is the cause of that stuff. And more likely that we never rose above it, which means, \"come back into fasion,\" is kind of silly. \n\nAs for the prediction about anti-intellectualism? well, that's an old comment. Like honestly, when has the population ever taken as truth what has been dictated by the ivory towers? Or college grads? \n\nThose are predictions aren't very amazing. you can probably find quotes just as, \"relevant,\" by marx or adam smith or hayek. Again: what's important isn't what is predicted, but indeed, how. which i'm sure is something the author discussed in his book. but this page by itself isn't that amazing.

For white collar, it was the increasingly bleak realities of education (which they'd always been told was a guarantee they'd never become blue collar workers). Almost all youth feel their job market is shittier than their parents, on track to continue to get progressively shittier, and that the people in power arent taking adequate measures because of a conflict of interest (the rich get richer and the poor get poorer was a liberal slogan this election but is almost identical to the criticisms of the elites in Washington fucking over the working man).\n\nNot to get into communist rhetoric.

Inflation rate is low. Interest rates are low.\n\nUnfortunately the headline rate masks the problems under the surface. For instance, the U3 rate doesn't show the quality of the jobs being created. Someone in the Rust Belt for instance who was formerly making $25/hr. in a manufacturing job with pension and health benefits who now works a low paid service job for $8/hr with no benefits is counted the same under U3, but is his quality of life the same? Not at all.\n\nFurthermore, a good portion of the decline in the headline U3 rate isn't due to tons of new jobs being created, but rather people who have stopped looking for work who are no longer counted as unemployed even though they very much are. The labor force participation rate is the lowest it has been in 40 years.\n\nAnd while again the headline inflation rate is low, it masks again what is going on under the surface. The headline rate is low mainly due to the costs of cheaply manufactured goods (mostly from abroad) dragging the inflation rate down. But the stuff that people **need** to live on has gone through the roof. Food, rent, education, medicine/health care/insurance, all the basic necessities have gone ballistic relative to incomes. But they're masked by the headline number because we can get flat screen TV's from China for $80.\n\nAnd while median incomes have risen, most of that is due to the pull of upper incomes dragging the median number higher, not actual incomes across the board rising uniformly.

Yes, there are some Trump supporters who are not necessarily poorer than average. But there are also many cultural and social cross-currents at work that have caused those people who are doing okay economically to fall for a strongman like Trump.

Plus its a good lesson on MLK who isn't taught nearly as in depth as he should be in public schools.\n\nIts still a way rougher convo than you would have liked (see: woman can do anything they want if they work hard!) But its not a bad conversation to have with a child.adversity is awful but it allows us to grow stronger and learn lessons we couldn't have otherwise. You always have to try to find a silver lining in every thing. If you don't,  you end up succumbing to depression.\n\nI literally tear up when I think of the potential future of the supreme court. But I try to focus on myself and what I do have control over to remind myself that I am strong.\n\nWomen, POC, and the lgbt community have been through much worse than this. This is an opportunity to teach them about all those fights and hatred these groups have gone through and show them the leaders who came through and advanced their community. That no matter how bleak, it gets better *because we **force** it to get better*. The civil rights movement is talked about in school but the womens lib movement and the rise of gay pride was almost completely untouched in my official schooling. Unfortunately fighting is a part of life for us. Its not fair but its our duty to work hard to make the fight just a little bit easier for the next generation. Those are things that maybe I wish a child didn't have to realize until they enter adulthood. But this is where we are and reminding the youth to stand strong and fight for their rights is a lesson they're already beginning to learn anyway. A focused and meaningful discussion about it with a parent rather than the usual peers isnt the worst thing.\n\nIf you even really need to talk about trump you can talk about demagogues and the danger in the cult of personality. About how its always important to be critical of those in power and question if they're doing what's right or what's easy. If youre really trying to get into history lessons, you can teach them about how other figures rose to power in their countries during time of turmoil and how sometimes they are good leaders and sometimes they are bad leaders.\n\nOur history has always been messy and disgustingly filled to the brim with bigotry. These weren't lessons you could have shielded them from much longer anyway. Just be grateful your kid is at this age. They had years of hope and optimism during key stages in their development and now that they're strong and confident adolescents they're going to be taught how to remain strong in the face of adversity. They'll be better adults for having had these lessons in such an intentional way with their parents.", "id": "da8b30u"}, {"comment": "I've never been one to cry \"they're setting a bad example for our kids!\" ever before.

It shows that majority of redditors have no one idea what goes into a job and what it takes to actually implement technology.\n\nDriving a truck across a interstate highway is only one part of the job which a self-driving automation can handle at this point.  But the rest of trucking doesn't lend its to driverless automation. It means driving in bad weather and in tight city streets where the truck will literally not not fit sometimes.   A driver can make decisions on what to move outside of the truck to get out of a tight spot, if its driverless, its stuck.  \n\nThen the whole point of  semi-trailer truck is that there is a truck and a trailer.  Customer loads the trailer on their own, the trucker will then pick it up at a given time and complete the job by dropping the load off at its destination, truck leaves so the customer can unload the trailer.  That means not only does the truck have to be self driving, but the trailer is also going to require expensive cameras and sensors.  The trailers are already not cheap and get damaged frequently which does not lend its self well to expensive sensors where a human driver can compensate for such problems, a computer won't.\n\nMy entire point is its a very very long way off till you see driverless trucks, the closest I see is an auto-pilot for interstate driving which is only a fraction of trucking, but then assholes here would demand that truckers should be paid less.  Yet you never hear that airline pilots are lazy for using auto-pilot on 100% of their flights.

As you said, it's just a fraction, but it's a rather large fraction. \n\nThe basic idea is truck depots will exist and the self-driving trucks will drive between them. A bit like ports. At these depots the drivers will take over for all the city driving and unloading. You'll not only see less hours, you can pay them less because these drivers won't be on the road away from home but local so they'll work for less. Also because there are less hours needed they will be forced to work for less as it's basic supply and demand and now you had a pool of drivers that spent hours on the interstate with nothing to do. That's just to start, the technology will mature over time, but we could do this today.  The technology exists, we just have to flip the switch. \n\nAlso airline pilots are mostly paid shit. The big airlines they can make good money, but those jobs are hard to come by. More than likely you've been on plenty of flights where your pilot was making $40k a year, and a young co-pilot even less. \n\nAlso no driver will be needed because unlike an airline, trucks can be programmed to pull over in the event of a malfunction and wait for assistance.

Its not the flip of a switch, For a shipping yard, its a half billion investment, then you need space available, that space being near places people want to ship stuff, and then fighting against unions who oppose it.  I like the article I posted because it does state that automated shipping yard is faster from simply being happy to run 3 shifts without overtime.  But the investment and the fact that you can't just convert a existing yard to automation easily is going to make automation a very slow process to be adopted, otherwise you would see more automated yards at this point, also consider that an automated yard is closed to the public, however a driverless truck is on public roads and deals with more variables once its out of the depot.\n\nOut in rural America, they have space build new infrastructure, but work in any metropolitan depot or yard, its tight and difficult to work in.  Something automation isn't particularly good at dealing with.

I'll give a small summary below. \n\nWhile lack of a college education is a common characteristic, people always seem to fail to mention that the average Trump voter's median income is higher than the democrats. They also fail to see that his staunchest demographic of white men without a college degree also comprise around 20,000 of the 33,000 gun deaths in America, primarily through suicide. They also tend to come from some of the unhealthiest communities, with higher than average mortality rates. They also tend to be from the least racially diverse areas and have almost no intergenerational mobility for wealth or social class. \n\nIn short, while many Trump supporters don't have college degrees, they work hard and earn decent money, yet they're killing themselves for reasons nobody knows, they see everybody around them dying younger, they live in a literal racial echo chamber, and have seen their families plateau out on the American Dream. The lives they were led to believe in while growing up has disappeared. \n\nThey saw Obama come with his promises of hope and change, but haven't seen any real result for their own lives and communities in the more rural areas. I believe most economic development went to urban areas with almost nothing apportioned towards rural communities. \n\nNow you got a candidate saying he can bring back your America. That he can bring back that greatness you grew up believing in and that your grandparents told you stories about. His rhetoric on women and minorities ring true with you because those are the same words you grew up hearing in that rural echo chamber of beliefs and stereotype. The other candidate, of the party who historically used to be for people like you, simply promises more of the same. \n\nAt the end of the day, Trump voters wanted change to happen. That base desire is not that different from why Americans voted for Obama in prior elections. Despite the best efforts of the Republican Party to try and deny Trump the nomination, he still won through their primary process. Democrats really ought to protest their own primary process until it's fixed and they get rid of the super delegate system. I'm more surprised that everybody is so quick to forget how the DNC conspired to help Hillary, and rewarded the people who were caught with positions in Hillary's campaign. \n\nHillary should have focused harder on the message of economic recovery and maybe spent more time visiting states like Wisconsin and Michigan instead of having a chip on her shoulder that these states voted for Bernie during the primaries. Find out why they chose him, and champion their issues by showing up, which she never did. I really think the hubris of the democrats led to their downfall in those states.

Among them:\n\n- Deporting 11 million people humanely in a few years. This simply cannot be done when you hash out the details and the legal paperwork. Or, you are going to create a bloody civil conflict where police will kill citizens in the crossfire.\n\n- Making Mexico pay for the wall. They will not do that, and taxing things like money transfers will get the US involved in a decades long international legal dispute.\n\n- Renegotiating our trade deal with China. We actually currently have no free trade deals with China. Any trade war with China will bleed American families dry. China has other markets, but we don't have other suppliers.\n\n- Jailing Hillary Clinton. Without an actual indictment, there will be no jail time. Unless Trump can coerce his AG to provide an indictment despite the numerous recommendations there should be no indictment, he is SOL here.\n\n- Cutting taxes, raising the military budget, and reducing the deficit. This is a \"choose 2\" scenario. Some economists will tell you that Trump will grow the economy. No economist will tell you that Trump will shrink the debt. Many poor Americans also wind up paying more in taxes under Trump's plan, while the biggest cuts are doled out to the top.\n\nAnd then there are some positions he took so vaguely that you will find Trump supporters that will argue Trump is in favor of:\n\n- Repealing the Marriage Equality ruling AND preserving the Marriage Equality ruling\n\n- Repealing Roe v. Wade AND preserving Roe v. Wade\n\n- Isolationist foreign policy AND starting a shooting war with Iran\n\n- Keeping legal Marijuana possible AND banning all Marijuana\n\n- Creating a national Muslim registry AND not creating a national Muslim registry\n\n- Ending our involvement with NATO AND strengthening NATO\n\n- Repeal Obamacare AND not repealing Obamacare\n\n- Fighting climate change AND revealing that climate change is a hoax\n\n- Building an actual wall AND not wasting money on an actual wall\n\nCase in point, there are some people right now who think Trump is their savior who will be sorely disappointed when he turns out to be a neocon budget slasher, or Paul Ryan's rubber stamp, or a new-age moderate Republican, or whatever you don't want him to be.

Replace it.***\n\n>Speaking at the Iowa Freedom Summit in January, Trump said ***Obamacare is a catastrophe that must be repealed and replaced.*** In 2011, Trump suggested that the health insurance industry have more ability to cross state lines. In \u201cThe America We Deserve\u201d Trump wrote that he supported universal healthcare and a system that would mirror Canada\u2019s government-run healthcare service.\n\n[But what did he say on his 60 minutes interview last Sunday?](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/7-things-we-learned-from-president-elect-donald-trumps-interview-with-60-minutes/)  \n\n>The president-elect says even though he wants to get rid of Obamacare, he will make sure people with pre-existing conditions are still covered. And he says he\u2019ll \u201ctry\u201d to keep coverage for \u201cchildren living with their parents for an extended period.\u201d (They can currently stay on their parents\u2019 plan till age 26.)\n\nSo like the two biggest parts of obamacare he has already decided to keep after the election.  Good luck \"replacing\" it with something that doesn't look 99% similar.\n\nI hope for the sake of the planet he has a similar change in stance in regards to climate change, but I'm not getting my hopes up.

Furthermore, if you've got a PhD studying climate change then you have a very vested interest in it being important.\n\nIt doesn't even have to be intentional, really. The climate is a hugely complex system, and when you're dealing with so much data and so many possible variables, the researcher has a tremendous amount of degrees of freedom to \"discover\" what's actually just noise.\n\nFor instance, take a look at statistics Professor Andrew Gelman's [thorough deconstruction](http://andrewgelman.com/2016/09/21/what-has-happened-down-here-is-the-winds-have-changed/) of what's going on in psychology science right now.

I suspect in the coming decade or two most of what we think we know about psychology will be debunked and the field will need to start fresh on a different tack (or be superseded by neuroscience, which obviously will be bad news for academics in psychology).\n\nI *don't* think climate science is in such dire straits. For one, just thinking about my own peers who went into the field, they're very smart and it feels pretty rigorous, at least compared to psychology. And they can make some predictions, which we can use to double check the field.\n\nBut there's certainly conflicts of interest there, and lots of money and prestige on the line in carrying on the party line.

I don't know about other states, but here in Texas, the EPA's regulations are largely enforced by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and the EPA itself only comes in pretty much when something happens that made (or could make) the national news. TCEQ is run by the State of Texas according to its own laws and statutes, vaguely in line with the EPA's mandates (as much as Texas ever toes the federal line).\n\nSecond, your local, family farmers definitely feel like the corporate farmers practically get away with murder.

Beautiful acreage that is all but useless because it has a dry creek that feeds into the river when the area floods -- once every hundred years or so. Because it is part of the Cumberland River Watershed, the EPA regulates what I can do with the land. So I basically let it go fallow. I live three states away and the taxes are only a couple hundred dollars a year.\n\nA few years back, my neighbor graded a section of his property because he had water seeping into his foundation. He took the leftover pea gravel and used it to line the dry creek bed because his wife thought it looked pretty. I got a notice from the EPA to remove it because I didn't have permission to alter the watershed. \n\nI don't remember what the daily fines were but it was enough to make me take notice. So I called up the neighbor and he went out with his tractor to push the gravel out of the creek bed into a pile on his side of the property line. But the EPA stopped him and threatened to fine him for interfering with the watershed. He called me up and told me that the EPA had told him that I had to hire an approved contractor and they would send me a letter letting me know what I could do.\n\nIn the meantime, we had a pine beetle invasion. The National Park Service asked if they could remove a section of my pine trees to help prevent the spread of the beetles. It's a beautiful area and I couldn't fathom it being completely deforested so I said yes. They cut the trees along the creek bed and when they were finished they bulldozed the area to create a line break. A week later I got a letter from the EPA saying I had not used an approved contractor to create the break and had damaged the watershed and would be responsible for the cost of the repairs. They were going to send their crew out to undo what the Park Service had just done. Fortunately, the Park Service set them straight and the issue went away.\n\nBut there is no way in hell that my dried up creek bed is a navigable waterway. It's not even a mud puddle.

I may not go back often but I still think of the area as home. That's why I know the neighbors even though I live so far away. Their family has lived on their farm for 200+ years.\n\nYet I know that the government needs a flood control plan for that area. The Corp of Engineers has ten dams on the Cumberland River. That heightens the flood risk even though my property is high and dry. I don't want any of that infrastructure put at risk.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that would help is a better permitting system. Hold the government to the terms of the permit once it's been issued. Don't let them change the rules after the project is underway. Then I could build with some confidence that I would be able to complete the project without huge cost and time overruns.

President Hindenburg was initially very reluctant to allow it. The chancellor was not precisely elected in Weimar Germany; theoretically the political parties would form a coalition representing a majority of voters and would select the chancellor themselves, with the acquiescence of the elected President. In practice Hitler was preceded by about 3 Chancellors who lacked virtually any electoral support, while the President ruled by emergency decree. Eventually they overcame Hindenburg's reluctance and formed a coalition government with the German Nationalists and Steel Helmets, who Hitler pretty quickly sidelined into irrelevance. \n\nThe Center Party never formed a coalition with the Nazis. There were no Federal elections in 1931, but in March 1932 the Nazis became the largest party in the Reichstag. The Center was the 4th largest party, after the Nazis, the Social Democrats, and the Communists.

The frequency of one should divide into the other one evenly.

The problem is if each key is tuned perfectly to the one next to it, by the time you get to the last one you are stuck with choosing between it being out of tune with the first or with the one next to it. Mathematically there's no way to get both.\n\nThink of it this way. A perfect tune means every key is the previous key's frequency plus 1. So any given key can be 13 for example, so the next key over will only harmonize perfectly with it if it's tuned to 14 (or 12 of you go in the other direction). The trouble arises because key 1 is also supposed to be exactly 1/10 of what key 12 is. If it isn't, *those* keys played together don't sound right.

Arguments that specific types of power will definitely get abused in specific ways are nonsense.  \n  \nAnd the counterexample is what happened in South Korea, where the government doesn't give two shits about civil liberties and now forces everyone to use their real name on all domestic websites. The reason was people joining online mobs that spilled over into real life harassment, stalking, and attacks on an alarming scale. The difference in the two national attitudes amounts to \"We don't trust the government, but the government has to trust us\" v.s. \"We can't trust the people, but the people have to trust us.\"  But the point is a lot of people were doing quite a lot they were using anonymity to hide, and the society reached a breaking point.\n  \n> \"Nothing to hide\" argument assumes that people will only try to punish you for doing things worth hiding. This is false.   \n  \nThis \"falsehood\" is an unsupportable claim, and itself an assumption--that the agencies involved have time to go \"punishing\" people for no good reason, and would be able to keep that a secret. The problem with these worst-case scenarios is they can be applied to any check on personal liberty. Should we abolish traffic stops because cops might stop people for no good reason?

", "id": "dajex7c"}, {"comment": "They also miss the point of privacy laws. Police ought to investigate strange behavior because it is so frequently associated with criminality. Investigation of strange behavior in public does not implicate privacy much if at all. \n\nThe guy running around on the street and the priest sitting in a church are in public spaces. They are exposed to public view and their behavior is subject to public scrutiny. Privacy is about giving people the right to withdraw certain activities and information from public view and then protecting that withdrawal from unreasonable government invasion. \n\nThe hard part is determining what counts as reasonable government invasion. The running man is strange, but a quick investigation with minimal invasion of the man's privacy can determine that he hasn't done anything illegal. But what about that odd fellow that keeps carrying tons of fertilizer and diesel fuel into his basement, despite having no visible garden or diesel-powered vehicles? Maybe a government raid would discover that he has a hydroponics setup with a diesel generator where he grows rare flowers. Maybe instead he is building a bomb to commit a terrorist act. The high probability that a search could uncover evidence of a criminal plot coupled with the high risk of harm from such a plot makes the search very reasonable. \n\nI am circling around the real issue here, because OP missed it entirely. But the ultimate question he is trying to get at is what constitutes probable cause. (Or whatever equivalent legal standard from a non-US jurisdiction you want to use). PC basically serves as the definition for circumstances which justify the government overriding someone's right to privacy or freedom of movement/property (roughly search or seizure). That's a highly context-dependent, factually specific determination. There's no simple rule that captures the distinction between running man and basement fertilizer guy.\n\nSimply put, some strange behavior meets the PC standard, some doesn't. You have to look at the totality of the circumstances involved. The running man story is a great example of the importance of context. It wouldn't be weird today at all, but within a specific cultural context it could be. Running could have had a very high correlation with criminality by that era's standards (I don't know because I'm not familiar with OP's story and it frankly stinks of apocrypha), in which case the police seizure (arrest) was reasonable. If 90% of people running around a town were fleeing crimes, it would be grossly negligent for the police not to stop someone who was running. Maybe that wasn't the case here and the cops were being unreasonable, but I am discussing general rules rather than how we get cops to follow those rules. \n\nUltimately, privacy violations are not just a matter of cops targeting people who do strange things. The core of our modern privacy problem grows out of the difficult and nuanced analysis required to determine when a government search should be allowed. There aren't many hard and fast lines that can be drawn (not least of all because criminals are aware of and willing to abuse such lines). And where there is legal grey area, police will exploit it to get arrests.\n\nThe only real, silver bullet, sound bite solution is to remove the cops' motivation to violate privacy. Decriminalizing drugs and ending civil forfeiture would do the trick. Get rid of the reason for our well developed surveillance apparatus and the apparatus will wither from lack of use. There are also many nuanced tweaks to Fourth Amendment jurisprudence we could make in the US (I can't speak with any authority about the rest of the world), but those are at best minor improvements to an already strong core. Laws that pit cops against privacy are far worse for privacy than any such weaknesses in the privacy laws themselves.

It's just not worth it to care enough to trigger loss prevention to find that 1 item out of 1000 damaged/missing items that is stolen.\n\nAlso, the breaks he gets are an exception, not the norm, which makes me wonder even more where he in located. I get two 15 minute breaks, in reality 10 minutes because 5 minutes of that is walking to the break room and back (yes they calculated this out and is completely intentional) and 30 minutes unpaid lunch. \n\nIn fact, this guy seems like he's been successfully brainwashed by the company. Amazon will destroy your soul at all levels, especially the tier 1s, because you are nothing but a number to them. You will be used and abused with no consideration for your well-being and none of that will have a bearing on your advancement, only how well you did in the interview and/or how long you've worked there.\n\nThe pay and benefits are usually good but it's just not worth it if you don't like being a complete robot. Most of the positions at the modern warehouses have you standing in one place performing the same task thousands of times a day with little to no variation in that task except for the items itself for 10 hours at a time. The only reason it hasn't been automated yet is because the human hand is very dexterous and adaptable and we have yet to design a robot to adequately mimic it. The minute we do however, and the Amazon warehouses suddenly become rather barren.", "id": "da13442"}, {"comment": "Do you work at an Amazon warehouse? I did and he described it exactly how it is.

We have onsite cameras and one or two 'security guards' but no sensors. Just a rotary gate to scan in/out of so they can track who entered/left the building and when. It's almost guaranteed that if an item goes missing, its not going to be checked up on very thoroughly unless it is a valuable item that we know went missing recently (or like someones phone, you know something we can actually go through the cameras with a decent time frame in mind, not 'oh it went missing sometime in the last month, care to look through a few thousand hours of feed for anything?')\n\nMostly part-time job except for manager positions. Rarely are you designated a single job such as picker, it's kind of everything limited only by the amount of training you need to do certain tasks and when they get around to training you. (Everyone is a stower/picker/transship and receive, you need training to bring trailers in and to use the comps which you wont get without working there for a while and showing that you have good work ethic)\n\nMost of the sites wont have you on a specific schedule after 6 or so months working there. Instead they post shifts and you sign up based on whats available. (This was a total nightmare for my site when we first transitioned over. One week they posted a total of 56  hours for about 30ish associates. Thankfully though the managers at my site are actually cool people and worked with headquarters so we get plenty of hours if we need them.)\n\nSites are way smaller too with no closed office spaces. Managers desk is out in the open right next to the slam stations. The only privacy is bathrooms, mothers room (basically used as a small meeting room) or break room. The employee feedback system is taken much more seriously because of this and good suggestions have been implemented a ton at my site.\n\nOverall its a lot nicer than the larger warehouses. Still busy work but a bit more laid back and the small size means you actually get to meet everyone who works with you/for you/you work for. It's definitely a lot better than most other jobs with the pay they give. ($13.50 at my site)\n\nEdit: Other things to mention, we can have our phones on site (no pictures for company and customer privacy) and listen to our own music (no headphones for safety) and there is almost always music blasting at the slam station. Really any music too as long as its SFW.\n\nPlus rates are a huge deal at other FCs but at ours they are important but usually very flexible.

Copypasta'd from something I already wrote:\n\n> Now, this is more of a prediction of what will happen in the near future, my opinion is that this outcome is almost certain. My reasoning, explained below, comes from a chain of logic between three videos: [CGP Grey's Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) a response video by [kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggN8wCWSIx4) explaining that Unconditional Basic Income is a viable solution should it be available and [CGP Grey's recent video The Rules for Rulers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs).\n\n> Humans Need Not Apply explains that general purpose AI is set to become able to perform jobs that before only humans were capable of. There's huge economic incentives to switch from human labor to AI labor, and it'll overpower any attempts unions make to stop the change; unions have always lost this battle. Most jobs won't safe from this takeover, even YOUR job. CGP Grey emphasizes that this isn't like the endless and idiotic predictions of futures that never are, the technology is already here, and the dawn of its ubiquitous influence is just over the horizon.\n\n> Now, in the wake of this revelation, one solution would be to increase the size of social welfare programs and convert how they function over to simplistic models such as Unconditional Basic Income to eliminate bureaucracy. I actually think this is a great solution, unfortunately, it'll never happen due to the required huge paradigm shift away from the concept that people should have to work in order to earn the right to live in society.\n\n> Rule for Rulers explains that republics are a lot like dictatorships in the way it has to cater to keys of power, except that a republic has many, many more keys of power to satiate than a dictatorship due to the difference in how a nation's wealth is accumulated. Dictatorships are often very small nations and their wealth comes from a single source such as oil or precious minerals mined from the earth. Republics on the other hand are capable of being much larger, and most of their income comes from the working class. So a government is incentivized to appeal to the many members of the working class in much the same way a dictatorship must appeal to the guy running the oil company or the guy supplying the military's resources.\n\n---\n\n> What I take away from this is that AI will push the working class into poverty. The corporations at the top no longer require human labor, so they take the keys of power previously held by the working class, effectively reducing the number of keys down to something comparable with dictatorships. (The aggregate of all corporations are actually owned by only a handful of people) The economy will scale down to catering only to the independently wealthy since the masses don't have any money. The governments will be forced to appeal to the rich exclusively (much more than they do now) since someone who tries to enact social welfare policies will be replaced with someone who'll promise to give money only to the rich. So Kliksphilip's solution definitely won't happen. This works to turn a republic into a (very large) dictatorship. Since the AI technology will be available globally, every republic is subject to this transformation. \n\n> Terminator and The sci-fi genre in general doesn't understand how AI work and is largely bullshit. It unfortunately gives our cultural perception of AI harmful misconceptions. Ironically, robots still take over the world, but it's not because AI becomes self-aware. Rather, it's solely because of the economic consequences of such a technology.\n\n/u/freevoulous:\n> > The economy will scale down to catering only to the independently wealthy since the masses don't have any money.\n\n> THIS I think will be fought against by almost everyone, the poor, the middle class, the government, but most importantly by the rich.\n\n> The vast, vast majority of the rich upper class get so by providing service to the common man. Usually, you don't get to be a billionaire by selling diamonds to other billionaires, but by selling burgers or cellphones to the Average Joe.\n\n> For the majority of the rich, it is of vital importance that the Average Joe has purchasing power to buy their product, even long after the machines take over and he becomes jobless. Without it, their buisness model will collapse and they know it.\n\n> This will immediately put the rich who get their wealth from mass production angainst the rich who get their wealth from elite services and detail production.\nYou'll see micro-loan bankers fight tooth and claw again investment bankers, or rent-house developers vs mansion developers due to conflict of interest.\n The first group will effortlessly win due to sheer numbers.\n\n> In a 15-20 years you will start to see the super-rich owners of the mass production speak in favor of UBI, because without UBI their corporate buisness model has no chance of survival.\n\nOur near future rests on the battle between companies like Wal-Mart and other companies like Lockheed Martin. Between companies that require the little guy to have purchasing power, and those that are contracted by the government. Ironically, despite how \"evil\" and profit-driven Wal-Mart is, it'll be the one to try to protect us. Not due to a change of heart, simply because the future endangers its profit margins.

I guess I'd call myself Cartesian, in that I try to question every assumption and verify the integrity of the sources of my information. It might not surprise you that I'm a scientist. \n\nSuffice it to say that I have a reasonably high confidence that my \"opinions\" are well-founded and justified by the best available information. For example: human fossil fuel consumption is causing global warming, and needs to be drastically reduced; even if this is expensive in the short term, it is a worthy goal to prevent the possibility of mass starvation and loss of large amounts of low-lying habitation. I am *extremely* confident in the factual basis for my concern: that humans are emitting CO2 from fossil fuels, that these emissions are causing global warming, and that continued warming will certainly cause a large rise in sea levels, and most likely will cause catastrophic crop failures in several important agricultural regions. Really if you have any bone to pick with my argument, it would be that the immediate cost of sharply reducing fossil fuel emissions is too high, but I think that is a poor argument, since catastrophic crop failures over a large enough area could result in the loss of hundreds of millions of lives, possibly triggering wars, which could lead to complete destruction of humanity. Even if you think this is a low probability... wouldn't you rather take the risk-averse path? \n\nBut apparently, trying to stop climate change before it gets too bad is just part of the liberal agenda. That's the message I hear from people like Trump, who called climate change a hoax. **He doesn't demonstrate to me that he understands the problem, so I can't respect his opinion.** If you have a problem with that, kindly get fucked because I think hundreds of millions of lives are at stake, quite possibly including my own, not to mention hundreds of thousands of species of plants and animals (which even as an environmentalist, I will admit I am not as selfish about as my own species). This extends to *most* issues. \n\nRepublicans in the US consistently fail to justify their opinions with facts or critical analysis. I do not respect their decision-making process.

The vast likelihood is that this would start a trade war with China, and that will be nothing good.  China's running out of steam on it's manufacturing anyhow; they've developed a substantial middle class, which is raising their cost of labor, they're running out of road on their previous policy of having no environmental controls, and they've been manipulating their currency to keep the manufacturing cheap- but they cant stave off cost rises forever.   In another 10-15 years, their manufacturing won't be the dominating force in global trade that it is today.  In the meantime, if we start a trade war with them, they have massive amounts of money invested in businesses over here that they could use to make life miserable for us.   Hillary would largely stay the course- chiding them over their currency manipulation, but not changing the status quo on this much.\n\nTrump - wants to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, Frack more, reinvest in coal, etc.  Can someone seriously defend this?  Climate change is real.  We're causing it.  All we can do is slow down the damage we're doing, but this will only make things worse for us and our children.   Hillary- would keep investing in renewables, work to meet our commitments in the Paris Accord.\n\nTrump -  \"Network Neutrality is the fairness doctrine for the internet\" - Enjoy paying an extra $5.99 to Comcast in order to get netflix, but our poor substitute service is free, suckers!  I don't know how anyone thinks this is good for them, unless they work for one of the major home internet providers.\n\nTrump - Infrastructure!  Anyone realize that Obama's been trying to do this his entire presidency, but the GOP has made sure he couldnt?  About the best idea Trump has voiced, but the only reason it might be more real is because the GOP could take credit for it.\n\nTrump -  reset relations with Russia.  Really?  This is the superpower that's flat out invaded two sovereign nations in the last 8 years.  Oh, and Trump's reading of the situation in Syria is a straight parroting of the reports from the Russian Defense Ministry- which have been consistently demonstrably lies.

And if you really want to see what they're up to, go google \"Foundations of Geopolitics\", and read the wikipedia article about it.  Compare what's in there to what's been going on in the world.\n\nTrump - Wants to cut taxes for the rich.  Where have we heard this one before?  What we need to do is close the gap between the tax burdens of small businesses (~35%), and fortune 500 corporations (average 12.5% is the last number we have).  And what spending will we cut when we cut our revenues? \n\nTrump - wants to tear up the ACA.  We've had the ACA for 8 years, and the republicans STILL haven't given us a plan for replacement of the ACA.  Health care costs were going up before the ACA, and they haven't stopped going up; not because of the ACA, but because the system is broken.

Copypasta'd from something I already wrote:\n\n> Now, this is more of a prediction of what will happen in the near future, my opinion is that this outcome is almost certain. My reasoning, explained below, comes from a chain of logic between three videos: [CGP Grey's Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) a response video by [kliksphilip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggN8wCWSIx4) explaining that Unconditional Basic Income is a viable solution should it be available and [CGP Grey's recent video The Rules for Rulers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs).\n\n> Humans Need Not Apply explains that general purpose AI is set to become able to perform jobs that before only humans were capable of. There's huge economic incentives to switch from human labor to AI labor, and it'll overpower any attempts unions make to stop the change; unions have always lost this battle. Most jobs won't safe from this takeover, even YOUR job. CGP Grey emphasizes that this isn't like the endless and idiotic predictions of futures that never are, the technology is already here, and the dawn of its ubiquitous influence is just over the horizon.\n\n> Now, in the wake of this revelation, one solution would be to increase the size of social welfare programs and convert how they function over to simplistic models such as Unconditional Basic Income to eliminate bureaucracy. I actually think this is a great solution, unfortunately, it'll never happen due to the required huge paradigm shift away from the concept that people should have to work in order to earn the right to live in society.\n\n> Rule for Rulers explains that republics are a lot like dictatorships in the way it has to cater to keys of power, except that a republic has many, many more keys of power to satiate than a dictatorship due to the difference in how a nation's wealth is accumulated. Dictatorships are often very small nations and their wealth comes from a single source such as oil or precious minerals mined from the earth. Republics on the other hand are capable of being much larger, and most of their income comes from the working class. So a government is incentivized to appeal to the many members of the working class in much the same way a dictatorship must appeal to the guy running the oil company or the guy supplying the military's resources.\n\n---\n\n> What I take away from this is that AI will push the working class into poverty. The corporations at the top no longer require human labor, so they take the keys of power previously held by the working class, effectively reducing the number of keys down to something comparable with dictatorships. (The aggregate of all corporations are actually owned by only a handful of people) The economy will scale down to catering only to the independently wealthy since the masses don't have any money. The governments will be forced to appeal to the rich exclusively (much more than they do now) since someone who tries to enact social welfare policies will be replaced with someone who'll promise to give money only to the rich. So Kliksphilip's solution definitely won't happen. This works to turn a republic into a (very large) dictatorship. Since the AI technology will be available globally, every republic is subject to this transformation. \n\n> Terminator and The sci-fi genre in general doesn't understand how AI work and is largely bullshit. It unfortunately gives our cultural perception of AI harmful misconceptions. Ironically, robots still take over the world, but it's not because AI becomes self-aware. Rather, it's solely because of the economic consequences of such a technology.\n\n/u/freevoulous:\n> > The economy will scale down to catering only to the independently wealthy since the masses don't have any money.\n\n> THIS I think will be fought against by almost everyone, the poor, the middle class, the government, but most importantly by the rich.\n\n> The vast, vast majority of the rich upper class get so by providing service to the common man. Usually, you don't get to be a billionaire by selling diamonds to other billionaires, but by selling burgers or cellphones to the Average Joe.\n\n> For the majority of the rich, it is of vital importance that the Average Joe has purchasing power to buy their product, even long after the machines take over and he becomes jobless. Without it, their buisness model will collapse and they know it.\n\n> This will immediately put the rich who get their wealth from mass production angainst the rich who get their wealth from elite services and detail production.\nYou'll see micro-loan bankers fight tooth and claw again investment bankers, or rent-house developers vs mansion developers due to conflict of interest.\n The first group will effortlessly win due to sheer numbers.\n\n> In a 15-20 years you will start to see the super-rich owners of the mass production speak in favor of UBI, because without UBI their corporate buisness model has no chance of survival.\n\nOur near future rests on the battle between companies like Wal-Mart and other companies like Lockheed Martin. Between companies that require the little guy to have purchasing power, and those that are contracted by the government. Ironically, despite how \"evil\" and profit-driven Wal-Mart is, it'll be the one to try to protect us. Not due to a change of heart, simply because the future endangers its profit margins.

I was 20 years old and had never tried to use my insurance before (at least not for anything more than an occasional doctor visit, and I was still on my parent's insurance at the time). They sent a claims adjuster to talk to me, without anyone else around, while I was *damn near comatose* in a hospital bed. I was so stoned the entire time I could barely form a coherent thought, and he grilled me for close to an hour, trying to get me to slip up and say something I shouldn't so they could deny the claim. \n\nAfter the insurance company denying my claim, we ended up getting a lawyer (luckily enough a family friend that was a notorious shark) who strong armed the insurance company. Basically said they would go to court with it, and they would show me, the once athletic 185lb 20 year old that was now 93lbs of skin and bones from blood loss and being stuck on a feeding tube. Basically said that no jury in the world would side with the insurance company at that point, and luckily the insurance company agreed, decided to cut their losses and settle.\n\nEven then, even after all that, even as the insurance company was trying to deny coverage to a client that had been paying for almost 20 years, a client with a legitimate claim, even then they wouldn't pay what they were supposed to.

If you don't, they get to keep your money. It's a good bet for them because most people won't have an accident, and even fewer will have their house burn down.

"], [11, "A rarely talked about part of the ACA is that it included the Mental Health Parity Act that had never managed to make it into law on its own. \n\nBasically, it says that mental health claims need to be reimbursed at the same rate as physical health claims and that they couldn't charge different copays or other costs. \n\nMental health was treated as less worthy or legitimate. Meanwhile, mental health isn't fundamentally different than  other neurological problems. If you have bipolar disorder or depression or just about anything else, it's because of chemistry in your brain. The insurance companies were ignoring the fact that psychiatric conditions are the result of neurochemistry, not just being moody. \n\nI am disabled because of an assortment of neurological conditions. As a result, I have chronic pain, am on long term opioid pain management, and abruptly went from a normal active adult to unable to work or engage in physical activity in the span of three months. \n\nI became depressed. Not just  \nbummed out or sad or frustrated. Debilitating depression. At the worst of it, I thought it rational that I commit suicide because it would be best for my wife, family, and friends. \n\nI finally saw a psychiatrist and learned that chronic pain and chronic opioid use (for pain mamagement) were potent causes of depression. The neurochemistry of the pain and the meds affected the neurochemistry that manifested in depression. My brain was chemically forced into depression. It was just a given. \n\nI needed meds to manage the depression along with weekly therapy. Fortunately, my psychiatrist did both med management and psychotherapy. And seeing her did as much for improving my quality of life as the neurosurgeries I had. \n\nBut my insurance didn't consider psychiatry and depression to be comparable to neurology. So instead of reimbursing claims at 80%, they only paid 50%.\n\nMy psychiatrist, as with almost all competent mental health providers in the area, didn't take insurance. I was paying $170 a week and being reimbursed $85 instead of $136 -- a difference of $51 per appointment, $204 a month, over $2,400 a year. \n\nAfter the ACA, I was finally being reimbursed at the same rate as medical claims and my weekly appointments went from a net cost of $85 per to $34 per. Finally, seeing my psychiatrist was comparable to paying the copay for a specialist visit. And I was saved thousands of dollars a year. \n\nI was fortunate that, with the support of family, I was able to 'afford' my psychiatrist pre-ACA. But that was not the case for everyone. The stigma and lack of concern or respect for mental health made it much more expensive to access services. That higher barrier meant that many people went without the care they needed. \n\nAnd I doubt I need to get into the details of what untreated mental illness can do.\n\nThe ACA made a big difference for mental health.\n\nThe reason why the Republicans failed to \"repeal and replace\" the ACA thus far is because they don't have a plan to replace the ACA while preserving the concrete, unquestionably good provisions that the law includes and that people/patients will not tolerate the loss of. \n\nAnd while the stigma and ignorance about mental illness means that fewer people will attest to the importance of mental health parity... I can tell you that it's yuge. Roughly 25% of Americans suffer from mental illness and it affects their families, as well. And it's a huge drain on the economy, costing roughly $200bn a year in lost productivity. Then there's the cost of disability insurance, health care, etc., leaving one estimate of nearly $320bn. While another study pegs the cost of major depression alone at $210bn for direct and indirect costs and lost productivity. \n\nMental health care is incredibly important and making it more expensive to access is intolerable.\n\nMental health parity must be preserved. As must other provisions of the ACA. \n\nWithout a doubt, we need to address the growing cost of health care in this country. But simply repealing the ACA will do so much more harm than the burden of rising premiums. \n\nFix it. Replace it with something better.

While insurance companies cannot rescind coverage (which is good), the ACA has done nothing to curb the cost of Healthcare.  Premiums are set to rise about 25% next year...

It has to do with seeing my quality of life go down every year because my income increases don't even keep pace with my healthcare premium increases, let alone inflation everywhere else.

I was 20 years old and had never tried to use my insurance before (at least not for anything more than an occasional doctor visit, and I was still on my parent's insurance at the time). They sent a claims adjuster to talk to me, without anyone else around, while I was *damn near comatose* in a hospital bed. I was so stoned the entire time I could barely form a coherent thought, and he grilled me for close to an hour, trying to get me to slip up and say something I shouldn't so they could deny the claim. \n\nAfter the insurance company denying my claim, we ended up getting a lawyer (luckily enough a family friend that was a notorious shark) who strong armed the insurance company. Basically said they would go to court with it, and they would show me, the once athletic 185lb 20 year old that was now 93lbs of skin and bones from blood loss and being stuck on a feeding tube. Basically said that no jury in the world would side with the insurance company at that point, and luckily the insurance company agreed, decided to cut their losses and settle.\n\nEven then, even after all that, even as the insurance company was trying to deny coverage to a client that had been paying for almost 20 years, a client with a legitimate claim, even then they wouldn't pay what they were supposed to. Luckily, the injury was from a violent crime, and the state actually stepped in and paid the majority of my hospital bill. Without that, I would be buried under around $75,000 of debt.

The argument for repealing ACA is that health care costs too much because there's too much regulation, and that if we loosened regulations market forces would work better and push the costs down.

Some others are that there is a huge amount of information asymmetry in the doctor-patient relationship, which makes it hard for patients to determine what a fair price for care is and leads to supplier induced demand (I.e. your doctor tells you need X, Y and Z tests, so now you start negotiating a price for those tests, when maybe you don't even need them in the first place), also healthcare isn't usually a substitutable good, nor is it usually a luxury good. You'll hear some people say \"but look at cosmetic surgery and Lasik, market forces work great there\" and that's true, but those are both *elective* things, not necessary care, like say, diabetes treatment. \n\nOn top of all that, I'm just not a fan of insurance companies.

Meanwhile, mental health isn't fundamentally different than  other neurological problems. If you have bipolar disorder or depression or just about anything else, it's because of chemistry in your brain. The insurance companies were ignoring the fact that psychiatric conditions are the result of neurochemistry, not just being moody. \n\nI am disabled because of an assortment of neurological conditions. As a result, I have chronic pain, am on long term opioid pain management, and abruptly went from a normal active adult to unable to work or engage in physical activity in the span of three months. \n\nI became depressed. Not just  \nbummed out or sad or frustrated. Debilitating depression. At the worst of it, I thought it rational that I commit suicide because it would be best for my wife, family, and friends. \n\nI finally saw a psychiatrist and learned that chronic pain and chronic opioid use (for pain mamagement) were potent causes of depression. The neurochemistry of the pain and the meds affected the neurochemistry that manifested in depression. My brain was chemically forced into depression. It was just a given. \n\nI needed meds to manage the depression along with weekly therapy. Fortunately, my psychiatrist did both med management and psychotherapy. And seeing her did as much for improving my quality of life as the neurosurgeries I had. \n\nBut my insurance didn't consider psychiatry and depression to be comparable to neurology. So instead of reimbursing claims at 80%, they only paid 50%.\n\nMy psychiatrist, as with almost all competent mental health providers in the area, didn't take insurance. I was paying $170 a week and being reimbursed $85 instead of $136 -- a difference of $51 per appointment, $204 a month, over $2,400 a year. \n\nAfter the ACA, I was finally being reimbursed at the same rate as medical claims and my weekly appointments went from a net cost of $85 per to $34 per. Finally, seeing my psychiatrist was comparable to paying the copay for a specialist visit. And I was saved thousands of dollars a year. \n\nI was fortunate that, with the support of family, I was able to 'afford' my psychiatrist pre-ACA. But that was not the case for everyone. The stigma and lack of concern or respect for mental health made it much more expensive to access services. That higher barrier meant that many people went without the care they needed. \n\nAnd I doubt I need to get into the details of what untreated mental illness can do.\n\nThe ACA made a big difference for mental health.\n\nThe reason why the Republicans failed to \"repeal and replace\" the ACA thus far is because they don't have a plan to replace the ACA while preserving the concrete, unquestionably good provisions that the law includes and that people/patients will not tolerate the loss of. \n\nAnd while the stigma and ignorance about mental illness means that fewer people will attest to the importance of mental health parity... I can tell you that it's yuge. Roughly 25% of Americans suffer from mental illness and it affects their families, as well. And it's a huge drain on the economy, costing roughly $200bn a year in lost productivity. Then there's the cost of disability insurance, health care, etc., leaving one estimate of nearly $320bn. While another study pegs the cost of major depression alone at $210bn for direct and indirect costs and lost productivity. \n\nMental health care is incredibly important and making it more expensive to access is intolerable.\n\nMental health parity must be preserved. As must other provisions of the ACA. \n\nWithout a doubt, we need to address the growing cost of health care in this country.

I've seen my premium (for a single, middle aged man) go from $150/month in 2012/13 to $487 in 2017 (which is up 84% from 2016). And it's not just the premium: my deductible has gone from $500 to $7500, my copays have more than doubled, etc. And I've been forced to take worse plans/coverage/high deductible plans just to have coverage that I can sort of, kind of afford if I make cuts elsewhere.\n\nIt has nothing to do with not caring about those who are sick, or not having empathy or thinking people should be denied coverage (they shouldn't). It has to do with seeing my quality of life go down every year because my income increases don't even keep pace with my healthcare premium increases, let alone inflation everywhere else. I feel screwed because I happen to be healthy.\n\nI think the ACA is a good start and the idea is sound. It's the implementation of it, and how I feel it's given insurance companies free reign. I would much prefer it being overhauled from a fees standpoint to make it more affordable for everyone. Overhaul the red tape and the outrageous fees to get an x-ray or see the doctor for 5 minutes.\n\nI feel it's a good start and shouldn't be thrown out, but there's a lot that can be done besides mandating everyone needs coverage and companies can't deny you.", "id": "d9x88rf"}, {"comment": "> I doubt anyone thinks the whole pre-existing conditions part of ACA is a bad thing\n\nMy uncle does.

In fact, not doing so, is antithetical to a real free market. \n\nTying insurance to an employer allows the employer to pay us partly in dollars and partly in insurance.

It was one of the worst, most infuriating things I can imagine.  Now, you can look at the grid and there's enough rules that you can have a decent idea what you're getting.  That *was not the case* prior to the ACA.\n\nInsurance companies did not show their rates on a web site.  If you called them, they would not tell you their rates.  They would insist you fill out their entire application form just to give you an estimate, and a couple of times they then proceeded to enroll me and begin billing me instead of giving me a price.\n\nPlans are long, and complicated, and could exclude almost any individual types of treatments or specific types of diseases or events.  If they wanted to say they didn't cover accidents in your home, that might be buried in there.  It was incredibly time consuming to see whether or not a given plan actually covered everything or whether it just looked like it covered everything on the surface.  Also, almost none of them *actually* covered everything.  They all had *something* buried in there.  You'd write notes like: \"effectively doesn't cover leukemia\".\n\nI'm an employer right now, and we provide health care, and let me assure you shopping for health insurance is still pretty miserable.  However, prior to the ACA there were no gaurantees of basic features or even easy to find listings of prices and limits.

I agree that delegation is important, especially at such a high level. I'll also say that's it's completely unrealistic for a candidate to qualified in all aspects of the office of presidency (military, foreign policy, domestic policy, education, law enforcement, economy, environment, etc.). But a qualified candidate should have some exposure to most, if not all of those areas. That's one of the reasons why past Presidents tended to be former legislators or governors. They were exposed to all of those different aspects of governing. President-Elect Trump has no such experience and has shown a dangerous disregard for acquiring more knowledge on some of those subjects. What's more, his suggested appointments have caused major concerns about his ability to choose advisors that will make up for his lack of knowledge and experience.\n\nImagine a massive restaurant with a coveted position of head chef. Now the head chef can't make every meal, can't clean every dish, and can't handle all the business aspects. A wise choice for head chef would be someone who had worked in a few different positions and had some specialties. They can't cook everything but they have years of experience working in professional kitchens and they know enough about enough subjects to make wise overall decisions and choose qualified people to handle the details.  Well this restaurant just hired a head chef who has never cooked, cleaned a dish, negotiated with suppliers, handled a health inspection, or had to deal with unhappy customers.\n\nBut from what half the nation is telling me the new guy sure does know how to run a tire shop. Now there's nothing wrong with tire shops, I just don't think being good at that makes you a good chef.

Because regardless if you use celsius, or farenheit, you just learn the numbers and you assign the apropriate warmth, coldness to it. People in Countries that use Celsius are simply taught that the average body temperature is 36. That's just a number, doesn't matter a flying fuck what number that will be. Could be 96, or 999. It doesn't matter, you just know this number is important and that is your gage for the temperature.\n\nBut, imagine you actually never heard about the systems. Celsius is easier to figure out. All you need to remember are 3 numbers. 0 At which the water is freezing. 100 At which the water is boiling. And 36 which is the body temperature. Now how do you figure out if something is cold or warm? \n\nAnything above your body temperature  (36<)= warm. Anything below your body temperature (<36) = coldish. Below the freezing point (<0) = fucking cold. That's the mystery behind the celsius. All you need to learn is the difference between one celsius. Which comes from experience.

If something is boiling it's 100 or above. If you see Ice it's 0 or below. \n\n>The average person will only interact with temperature in cooking, determining a healthy body temperature, and determining what the weather is like outside.\n\nExactly. Which is why doesn't matter what system you use, one bit. You just assign arbitrary numbers, to an arbitrary values. The difference is that in celsius The values are 0 and 100. An even number between two mirror concepts that are useful in our every day life. Which turns out to be extremely useful because we kinda relying of water and are made of water and today using those 2 concepts as standard in most areas. Making the scale consist of even numbers, intuitive for us to quickly convert from one system to another, by moving the decimal point.\n\nFahrenheit on the other hand was labelled from 0 which is the freezing point of the solution of brine that is not a constant. And upper part 96 is the average human temperature of a body, which is not a constant. So you can have 64 parts between those two unrelated concepts. The reason Fahrenheit chose those the power of two is that he could construct the scales on his thermometer by bisecting the lines on his scale 6 times, which made labeling things easier for him. Later on, people came along and said that that's not useful and redefined the upper end in terms of the boiling point of water as 212. As a result it's even more arbitrary. Zero is now somewhere near the temperature of the ice brine, but not quite, 32 is exactly the freezing point of water, 100 is pretty close to but still warmer than the body temperature and 212 is exactly the boiling point of water.\n\nWhat? I mean that Is THE definition of the Fahrenheit.\n\n>For body temperature, I may know that 36 is healthy, but when should I be concerned? Is it at 37 or should I wait until 37.5. With fahrenheit the rule of thumb is anything over 100 because healthy is in the high 90s.\n\nAgain, don't understand the issue here. I could just as say. \"When should I be concerned. Is it 98.6F or should I wait until 99.5F?\" And side note Average human temperature is 37C, not 36C. I thought it was 36 because we used temperature that accounted for heat loss because you actually didn't stick it (in). Nevertheless the rule of thumb for celsius is 0.5C difference from 37 is okay. More is not. It doesn't strikes me paticularly harder than (100F is roughly okay)\n\n>Finally, i think it is simpler to discuss the weather outside on a 0 to 100 scale, instead of -18 to 38\n\nWhere did you come up with those 2 numbers. It's gets way colder and warmer than those 2? Ahh, by fahrenheit conversions of 0 and 100 of course. But those aren't even extremes in my country, which isn't both the coldest, or the warmest place on Earth. So I don't exactly know what do you mean by more useful. At least in Celsius you can show full range of (above freezing) temperatures that could occur if you use the native 0 - 100 scale.\n\n> Contrary to your assertion sub 100 F (36C) temperatures are not coldish.\n\nAnything below your body temperature you sense as cold. Because you judge cold based on difference between your body temperature and the outside temperature. You would not coloquially say it's cold outside if it's 36. Because it might not be windy outside and sun does warm you up. But if it's windy, it will be slightly colder. But you would absolutely say that 36C bath is a cold one. It's not freezing cold, you just don't absorb any heat but you loose some. Hence what cold means. If the water would be 37+, depending on your actual body temperature. You would describe the bath as warmer. Because it's warmer than your body temperature. And if it's windy outside while being 37+, you would describe it as again as warm.\n\n>In fact most would say that warmish in celsius happens around 20C. \n\nYeah, depends where you live, how windy it is, etc... Arbitrary for both scales.\n\n>I would think a metric devote would see the merit in a system that discusses the weather in nice round integers going from 0 to 100.\n\nBetween 2 unrelated concepts that don't describe even the full range of temperatures? I certainly does not see the advantage.\n\n\n>. I don't really understand your point when it comes to memorizing three numbers because It seems to be the same for any temperature scale \n\nI said that memorizing the numbers doesn't matter one bit. You just understand the temperature in a way you learned to, regardless of the arbitrary value you assign it to. That is mine point. \n\n>and again it assigns importance to the temperatures that water under goes a phase transition, which isn't actually something people measure that much.

And contrary to YOUR popular belief, it is the standard of most scales. Be it physics, health, astronomy, weather forecasts (the transition of water), etc..

That's literally all it is.\n\n>The fact of the matter is who cares about precision when doing fermi problem's in one's head to determine the temperature of a swimming pool.\n\nI'm sure a lot of mathematician, physicists, engineers, etc... care a lot about this stuff. You know, the people the country consists of, other than those who can barely count. The point is, I can do that if I so choose, without any tables of conversions, calculators, etc...\n\nYou, unless you have photographic and analytic memory I doubt you can in imperial. You simply cannot relate any of those quantities. And when you decide to the error margine will be quite high simply because human mind isn't used to work with arbitrary numbers in relations to each other. \n\n> The average person doesn't care how much energy that it takes to heat a galon of water 10 F. \n\nAgain, I'm sure there are industries that depends on this exact factoid.\n\n>The average person doesn't want to list decimal places when talking about fine gradations of temperature. \n\nThis is actually point against Fahreheit since it generally uses 3 decimal system. And can show finer variety natively.\n\n\n\nThe point of my rant is that fahrenheit does not have any advantage over celsius. They are both 2 arbitrary values we assigned 2 arbitrary numbers. The point is that boiling and freezing point of water is universally important. And Celsius has better numbers, because they are even and in base 10. Which is more useful for calculations and conversion. It's connected with metric system. While Fahrenheit isn't connected even with Imperial system. Overwhelming majority of globe uses Celsius and Metric. In fact I think it's only US and partly UK that uses imperial in ANY capacity. The only advantage of fahrenheit is that it is in some cases more intuitive than Celsius for people who grew up using fahrenheit.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "dal9qc2"}, {"comment": "More granular doesn't mean better unit.

It's crazy how reflexively reactive people on both sides of the aisle are to the idea that the world did not and will not end when their \"team\" loses.)\n\nFor eight years, Bush was literally Hitler and was going to bring about the Christian Rapture so white supremacists can go to heaven after killing all the brown people and women.\n\nFor eight years, Obama was literally a Muslim jihadist in disguise who was going to import terrorists in by the boat load after literally forcing white Christian men to marry other men and send then send Christians to internment camps. \n\nNow Trump is coming into office and he is literally Hitler and he is going to create Muslim internment camps and literally rape every woman and offer tax incentives for companies to lynch brown people. \n\nThese are things I have seen people actually say. And the truth is the world is in general safer than it was, is working towards better equality for minorities every day, fewer terrorist attacks, less gun crime, etc. But no one can handle that because they have absorbed their political beliefs as a part of their identity rather than keep it as a philosophy for how to best govern the country. So when they're on the \"losing\" side, the world is ending because they feel like they've been personally rejected by all of society. You can hear the desperation in people's tones when their predictions don't come true because how can a world that has rejected them personally ever succeed?\n\nThe western world is much more moderate and mild than most want to believe. Hysteria is easier to maintain than nuanced critical thinking. I know that sounds like an \"edgy\" thing to say but hysteria and drama is more profitable for the media as well, as anyone can see. Good news doesn't make money. \n\nClinton (Bill), Dubya, Obama have come and gone and the US has made progress in some places and stepped back in other ways. Same thing will happen with Trump and the same thing will happen with the next democrat president, maybe Michelle Obama? Maybe Bernie will give it another go? We'll see what happens but at the end of the day it's more likely that the more extreme predictions are not going to come true. \n\nEdit 1: perfect proof below demonstrating how emotionally reactive people can be when you mention a president who wasn't on their \"team\".\n\nBefore anyone else responds with dramatic assumptions, I am politically neutral and have no dog in the fight in regards to my above comments. I do not like or dislike any particular president. Also if you read my comment before leaping head first to defend your personal political identity, you'll see that I'm talking about hysteria and ridiculous predictions and NOT about the actual good and bad things any particular presidency accomplished. Try to separate your politics from your self image and it will be easier to see what I mean. \n\nEdit 2: the fact that so many of you assume I'm supporting Trump is so fascinating. Maybe older redditors could chime in on how people reacted to Bill Clinton taking office and if the same hyperbole was so prevalent. I would be curious to see if the world was less prone to hysteria before click bait ad revenue was a thing or if I'm just remembering it that way because of nostalgia. \n\nEdit 3: holy shit some of you are completely going off the deep end.\n\nEdit 4: I'm not a conservative and I don't think Bush was a good president. I figure I might as well say that now before anyone else jumps to conclusions. You guys have done nothing but prove my point and masturbate your own political ego by constantly assuming I vote against climate change, support Bush, or worst of all am against reproductive rights. Your knee-jerk reaction to Bush's name and my assertion that the world did not end with his presidency is truly fascinating. It really is sad how political discussions can't be civil.

But I would have much preferred that they ruled at a state level and allowed the states to make those rulings themselves.\n\n*Much* like the Roe V Wade comments during the debate, he dances around the question.  He pivots to states right when he can, but he's been clear on his support of 'traditional marriage' ([CNN interview](http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/06/28/sotu-tapper-trump-is-for-traditional-marriage.cnn)), which I just find crazy for someone who's been married multiple times.\n\nSo, he's saying it's *not* time to move on, he thinks states should decide, he would be very strong on putting judges on the bench who could 'change things' (those things being the fact that homosexuals have equal marriage rights, that's the fucking subject here), and he can see changes happening, because 'most people' feel the same way he does.\n\nI get that supporters appreciate and like his 'straight talk', but he's made plenty of inappropriate comments on homosexuals over the years, both before and during his campaign.\n\nEven people further down this thread comment about how things that have been touted on the platform and said 'won't ever happen' because it's so outlandish.  How the **fuck** can you be so sure that he's going to say one thing, and do another, and his action will be the right one?  You can't.  \n\nWe absolutely could go backwards when it comes to homosexual rights.  Why not?  Because those laws would be 'discriminatory'?  He wouldn't change that right?  He wouldn't *advocate that individual states  be allowed to make those choices right*?  He wouldn't say that Caitlin Jenner is free to use whatever bathroom she wants in Trump Towers, but then endorse NC's HB2 and say it's a great idea because the state gets to decide what's best for it, right?\n\nGive me a break.  It's the same with abortion.  He wouldn't come right out and say his real stance on abortion and Roe V Wade until Wallace put him on the spot, in front of a national audience, and would *not* let him evade a straight answer.\n\nI don't think we're about to descend in to some lawless land where it's legal to string up gays, but why on Earth *wouldn't* anyone in the LGBT community believe they're about to have rights taken away from them?

I could easily see how someone could look at the verses you referenced and still argue that women are subordinate to men and the Bible would be against feminism.\n\n*(1 Cor 7:2) All it's saying here is husband and wife should fuck.\n*(1 Cor 7:3) And a woman's duty is to be submissive. (Eph 5:22)\n*(1 Cor 7:4) Again, just saying married people need to get it on.\n*(Eph 5:31) One flesh with the man as the head. (Eph 5:23)\n*(Rom 10:12) This is just talking about ethnic equality.\n*(Gal 3:28) Sure it's talking about equality, but it's a very loose idea of equality.\n\nThe reality is its verses like 1 Cor 14:34-35 and 1 Tim 2:11-15 that encourage anti-feminism and put Evangelicals 60 years behind moral progress. Anti-feminism doesn't exist despite Christian doctrine, it exists because of it.\n\nI liked your last point, though.

And because the cult was in a place where abortion was, at the time, impossible to get, she was forced by her parents to marry him. And this was the best thing that ever happened to him.\n\nAnd the thought that even one man out there won't be able to impregnate some woman he coerces to have sex with him, or the possibility that even if he does he won't be able to force the woman he gets pregnant to marry him, is such a massive social injustice that he is carrying a lot of rage, still, over the fact that the Democrats didn't kick the feminists out of the Democratic coalition. He argues that because the labor movement was so heavily Catholic, and because there's a strain of libertarianism in the Republican coalition already, the pro-contraception and pro-abortion campaigners would have been, in his opinion, a better fit with the Republican platform.\n\nSo if the feminists hadn't forced him to fund Republicans if he wanted contraception and abortion outlawed for the greater good of the next man who needs to force a woman to marry him, he says, we would never have had trickle-down economics, the new Jim Crow era, or the carceral/torture state. And he hates those things. And given that the Republicans still haven't managed to outlaw contraception and abortion, despite all the money he and his successors raised for them, he thinks it wasn't worth it.\n\nBut he blames women, and the Democratic men who don't want to own women.\n\nAnd he's not alone.", "id": "da1nngs"}, {"comment": "What?\n\nSo this is a guy who left the evangelical church, thinks that men coercing women into sex and then getting them pregnant and then forcing them to marry is a great thing and should happen more often.

Don't get me wrong, some of it is true, but a lot of it is leaving something important out, or just hyperbole\n\n>1) Promote a climate change denier as head of the EPA. (http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/23/503156456/trump-says-he-has-open-mind-on-climate-but-staff-pick-raises-questions)\n\nYup, this one sucks.  Hopefully Trump learns more about climate change and starts to think better of it.\n\n>2) Defund NASA's climate studies...because...f*** facts. (https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/nov/22/nasa-earth-donald-trump-eliminate-climate-change-research)\n\nThis is pretty much true, but it does leaves out some info.  He claims he wants NASA to focus on space.  And is shifting the climate change to other companies such as the NOAA [http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/303384-trump-takes-aim-at-nasas-climate-budget](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/303384-trump-takes-aim-at-nasas-climate-budget).  But [NASA does offer valuable info no one else really can](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/5etua1/uradeh_outlines_donald_trumps_plans_so_far/dafh53s/). In theory the funding should be going to a different location, its unclear if that will happen though.  So it is bad, just not quite as clear cut as the OP statement implies.\n\n>3) Promote a religious fundamentalist nut as the secretary of education. Granted, a lot of dumb people got him into power...so it's only fair he wants to increase the amount of dumb people. (OP link to vox includes how she is pro common core and wants to push creationism)\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of religious nuts are in power in these places, so this is par for the course.  However, the article has a lot of bs in it.  She has mentioned she does not support the common core [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-picks-billionaire-betsy-devos-school-voucher-advocate-as-education-secretary/2016/11/23/c3d66b94-af96-11e6-840f-e3ebab6bcdd3_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/trump-picks-billionaire-betsy-devos-school-voucher-advocate-as-education-secretary/2016/11/23/c3d66b94-af96-11e6-840f-e3ebab6bcdd3_story.html) and there is not any real indication that she will be pushing creationism [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/11/23/betsy-devos-trumps-education-pick-is-a-billionaire-philanthropist-with-deep-ties-to-the-reformed-christian-community/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/11/23/betsy-devos-trumps-education-pick-is-a-billionaire-philanthropist-with-deep-ties-to-the-reformed-christian-community/).\n\n>4) Lower salaries, yay. (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/donald-trump-overtime-pay-president-voters-moment-he-takes-office-1143-barack-obama-regulations-a7432421.html)\n\nNot lower salaries in general, just removal of mandatory overtime pay that was implemented by executive order that has been being fought in the courts [http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-employment-overtime-idUSKBN13H2JY](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-employment-overtime-idUSKBN13H2JY).  To be clear, shutting this down would lower salaries under certain conditions for some people.  I only mean to refute the implied \"lower salaries in general\".\n\n>5) Promote a guy to chief strategist who is basically a mouthpiece for racist idiots. (https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/steve-bannon-white-house-racism-fear)\n\nThis one is pretty ridiculous.  All of the calls of Steve Bannon being a white nationalist stem from a comment he made a while ago of how Breitbart is a \"platform for the alt-right\".  It's fairly clear (at least it was to me) that it means they cover the alt-right when nothing else does.  Covering something doesn't mean you support it or are a part of it.  The articles about the alt-right that are on that website do not outright vilify them but they also don't show support for them, which I think is the correct way to cover something...  Every article you find on this just has various people calling him a white nationalist and nothing else.  That doesn't make him a white nationalist.  If you've got some further proof I'd be happy to know of it!\n\n>6) Implement a tax plan that cuts taxes by 0.8% for the vast majority of people...oh...and 14%+ for the top 1%. Making a stand for the little man, just like he promised ;) (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-tax-plans-what-are-they-richest-wealthy-poor-a7436311.html)\n\nTrue, and not overly hyperbolic good job!\n\n>7) Hand a powerful position to the current (super ineffective) head of the NSA...a man employees say has no leadership qualities.

(https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/jeff-sessions-marijuana-legalization-race-colorado)\n\nEDIT:  I changed this to an abc article.\n\nThese allegations stem mostly from some shit said in 1986.  Regardless of it was true or not, he has been very supportive of civil rights and such since then and had a hand in prosecuting KKK members and honoring civil rights leaders.  Calling him racist is pretty similar to calling clinton racist for her super predators comment. It is just silly.  Some more info [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeff-sessions-race-civil-rights/story?id=43633501](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeff-sessions-race-civil-rights/story?id=43633501)\n\n>9) Wants to start a trade war with China which will drive up prices in the US and basically leads to everyone losing. (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-15/how-trump-s-china-trade-war-could-play-out-quicktake-q-a)\n\nThis is true that he wants to pull out of trade agreements, however there are a lot of ideas of how that will go.  I dunno if its a good idea in the end but saying how it will go as a fact is a bit much.\n\n>10) Seems ok with child labour. (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-child-labor-acton_us_5836eb7fe4b000af95edf12e)\n\nSo his secretary of education has donated to a group that she was previously on the board of and that group has stated it thinks \"A long day\u2019s work and a load of sweat have plenty to teach as well.\"  So I guess its possible she is pro child labour, and by extension Trump is.  But its a bit of a leap at this point.  I welcome anyone with more info though as I dont know much about this so just read that article.\n\n>11) Creationist VP who actually wants to teach that crap in schools. (http://deadstate.org/mike-pence-believes-the-earth-is-6000-years-old-and-he-wants-to-teach-that-to-your-kids/)\n\nYa sucks.\n\n>12) Wants to end net neutrality. (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/hillary-clinton-vs-donald-trump-on-broadband-she-has-a-plan-he-doesnt/)\n\nThe people he appointed to FCC are against net neutrality.  So ya this sucks too.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nPlease don't just blindly believe everything you read on news website etc guys.

I did not vote for Trump and was counting on Hillary winning.  I have the luxury of living in California where we all knew it was going to vote Blue, so I followed my conscience and voted third party, as I could not bring myself to personally vote for Hillary.  \n\nDuring the 2008 election I couldn't decide what was more obnoxious, liberal sore winner smugness on reddit or conservative whiny belly aching on Facebook.  \n\nMy conclusion was that both were so bad there could be no winner.  Conservatives continued to bitch and moan even when Obama proved to be good at what he did.  Liberals wanted to shove everything Obama did down everyone else's throat, even when it wasn't good.\n\nNow that the shoe is on the other foot I have the same conundrum.  The conservative sore winner gloating on facebook is horrendous, the liberals whiny sore loser bellyaching on reddit is worse so far.\n\nThe Facebook conservatives are in more of a hooray we did it so far.  I do think that will change once Trump is actually in office and does, well, anything (we all think it won't be good).  The reddit liberals are screaming about how the world has ended when the Trump still isn't even in office.  Redditors seem to feel a need to bellyache at all times in every corner of reddit, there is no escape on this site.  It's a really, really annoying echo chamber.  Preach all the hellfire and brimstone you want at the choir, the people that should be hearing it are never going to listen to this much anger and vitriol.  Good God, calling for the deportation or outright murder of people who dare have different political belief will never change anyone's opinion and will only further entrench them in their beliefs.  \n\nYes, I know, I dared call out reddit liberals for being obnoxious in a /r/bestof thread glorifying reddit liberals for being obnoxious, downvote all you want, hurl angry messages at me, it just proves my point.\n\nWe all know what Trump promised his constituency to win is crazy as hell.  We all know that if he actually follows through with his promises we are in deep shit.  Let's wait and see what actually happens before crying apocalypse like so many conservatives did in 2004 and 2008 when Obama was elected.

The comments say Trump supporters are narrow minded too...."], [29, "**These links are bullshit and here's why:**\n\nThe OP seems to have not read any of the articles and based his \"facts solely on headlines\"\n\n**\"1.) Promote a climate change denier as head of the EPA.\"**\n\n* The link that you send these people to, if they actually choose to read it states:\n\n> Ebell said he and his colleagues at the Competitive Enterprise Institute agree that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and that concentrations are increasing as a result of burning coal, oil and natural gas, and that this means the global temperature is likely to rise.\n\n> Indeed, Ebell suggested that climate change could be a boon for the world. While there could be long-term challenges, he also noted that:\n\n> \"There is much evidence that the mild global warming that has occurred since the end of the Little Ice Age in the mid-nineteenth century has been largely beneficial for humanity and the biosphere. Earth is greening, food production has soared, and human longevity has increased dramatically.\"\n\nMyron Ebell is not a climate change denier. He knows it exists. He just has debated the seriousness of it and says it has shown to be a good thing in some facets.\n\n**\"2.) Defund NASA's climate studies...because...f*** facts.\" **\n\nBesides the fact that The Guardian is **heavily** biased, but if you actually chose to read this the article states:\n\n> Bob Walker, a senior Trump campaign adviser, said there was no need for Nasa to do what he has previously described as \u201cpolitically correct environmental monitoring\u201d.\n\n> \u201c**We see Nasa in an exploration role, in deep space research,\u201d Walker told the Guardian. \u201cEarth-centric science is better placed at other agencies where it is their prime mission.**\n\n> \u201cMy guess is that it would be difficult to stop all ongoing Nasa programs but future programs should definitely be placed with other agencies. I believe that climate research is necessary but it has been heavily politicized, which has undermined a lot of the work that researchers have been doing. Mr Trump\u2019s decisions will be based upon solid science, not politicized science.\u201d\n\n* It very clearly states that the funding will be directed to other agencies that will research climate and NASA will be focusing on exploring the solar system and deep space. It's too bad the headline is biased as fuck.\n\n**3.)\"Promote a religious fundamentalist nut as the secretary of education. Granted, a lot of dumb people got him into power...so it's only fair he wants to increase the amount of dumb people. \"**\n\nAnd? \n\nHonestly. \n\nSo you are suggesting that a person's religious beliefs should be disqualifying for a job? I realize this is r/Atheism and I'm agnostic myself, but come one. That ridiculous.\n\nThere is 0 evidence she wishes to push any of her religious agenda on public schools. She is a big believer on choosing where your child goes to school and I assume she will be anti-common core.\n\n**\"4) Lower salaries, yay.\"**\n\nAgain, biased article. I'll let Snopes show you why that is bullshit. I don't like scopes, but even a broken clock is right twice a day.\n\n> WHAT'S TRUE: A federal judge issued an injunction against a regulation put in place by the Obama administration that would expand overtime pay to millions of workers.\n\n> WHAT'S FALSE: The action was not taken by President-elect Donald Trump, and his ability to unilaterally do so is questionable.\n\nEven if he wanted to do that, he most likely wouldnt be able too. I\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/trump-to-strike-down-obamas-regulation-expanding-overtime/\n\nPlus, all of these business regulations are job killers. A business should not be forced to pay overtime to someone earning a salary. I honestly wish he would kill it. \n\n**5.)  \"Promote a guy to chief strategist who is basically a mouthpiece for racist idiots.\"**\n\nAgain, biased.\n\nDoes Breitbart report on the alt-right? Sure. \n\nI understand where people come from on this one. I hate the alt-right. The actual alt-right are racists. Fortunatley r/The_Donald is not alt-right.\n\nJust because a news organization reports on a horrible group of people does not mean that that company or its leader hold those views. Does CNN hold the views of black supremacists and Radical Islamists? Of course not. Do they hold the views of the man who tried to kill Trump back during the primaries? Of course not. \n\nAlso, there is 0 proof that Steve Bannon is a racist, anti-Semite, and white-nationalist.\n\nI'll let the anti-defamation league take care of this one.\n\n>\"WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY ANTI-SEMITIC STATEMENTS FROM BANNON.\n\n> While there is a long fact pattern of evidence that Breitbart served as a platform for a wide range of bigotry and there is some controversy related to statements from Mr. Bannon\u2019s divorce proceedings in 2007, we are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements made by Bannon himself.  In fact, Jewish employees of Breitbart have challenged the characterization of him and defended him from charges of anti-Semitism. Some have pointed out that Breitbart Jerusalem was launched during his tenure. \n\n> Nevertheless, Bannon essentially has established himself as the chief curator for the alt right. Under his stewardship, Breitbart has emerged as the leading source for the extreme views of a vocal minority who peddle bigotry and promote hate.\"\n\nhttp://www.adl.org/sp/stephen-bannon-backgrounder/bannon-backgrounder.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\n\n**6.) \"Implement a tax plan that cuts taxes by 0.8% for the vast majority of people...oh...and 14%+ for the top 1%.

The way that it will work is if we de-regulate and audit the Fed. Luckily Trump holds those two positions. I'll let Peter Schiff explain.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AIew3RN4R4\n\n**7) \"Hand a powerful position to the current (super ineffective) head of the NSA...a man employees say has no leadership qualities.\"**\n\nHe hasn't picked this position yet.

They've been wrong in all of their speculation for his positions thus far. \n\n**8.) \"Anti-legalization attorney general...conveniently that asshole's also a white supremacist. \"**\n\nOh for fuck's sake. There is 0 proof that Jeff Sessions is a white supremacist. Second: The Attoorney General does not set his own policies. He carries out the policies of the President. Trump has been a supporter of leaving the states up to Marijuana AKA he wants to legalize it. Jeff Sessions has been very loyal to Trump for the past year and a half because of his stance on Illegal Immigration. Making Marijuana legal is one of the first steps to chopping the head off of the snake that is illegal immigration. I'm sure that Sessions will follow Trump's lead.\n\n**9.) \"Wants to start a trade war with China which will drive up prices in the US and basically leads to everyone losing.\" **\n\nHas he ever specifically stated that he wants to start a trade war with China? That's a pretty polarizing statement. \n\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-art-of-the-deal-with-china-1479794162\n\nThis article is a lot less polarizing and factual. You should actually read it.\n\n**10.) \"Seems ok with child labour.\"**\n\nHoly fuck. You actually linked HuffingtonPost. Wow.\n\nShe has never said she is \"ok with child labor\".\n\nThe article that HuffPo links to clearly states that they would like to see 14-year-old kids work a couple hours a week at a grocery store or fast food restaurant so they understand the value of work before they enter serious education. They aren't suggesting that 10-year-olds work in a damn coal mine. These titles are shit and that is basically all you have been reading. \n\n**11.) \"Creationist VP who actually wants to teach that crap in schools\"**\n\nDeadState is worse than HuffPo. The Titles are extremely polarizing. He does not want to teach it in schools and hasn't ever denied Evolution.\n\n>The VP-elect may not have absolutely denied the phenomenon of evolution, but he has said that \"intelligent design provides the only even remotely rational explanation for the known universe.\"\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/2016/11/13/mike-pence-evolution/\n\n**12.) \"Wants to end net neutrality.\"**\n\nThis is one of his stances I don't fully agree with him on, although I believe that regulations need to be cut from the internet. Net Neutrality is just a giant regulation and is horrible for creating competition.

He did issue an executive order that gave *that one county* the ability to start a program.  So he didn't change policy state-wide (and it's not clear that he could have, given that it was a state law that prevented counties from operating them).  He would later [sign a law](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/07/21/486771345/as-indiana-governor-mike-pence-s-health-policy-has-been-contentious) that allowed counties to run needle exchange programs *if* they apply for permission from the state, which is apparently slow and expensive.\n\nSo yes, when faced with a terrible HIV breakout, he (eventually) allowed a single county to run a needle exchange.  Your post, however, implies a faster and broader response than is true.\n\nYour defense also leaves out a couple of things.  A state legislator had wanted to undo the ban entirely earlier in the year (the first cases in Scott County were found in late 2014), but was rebuffed by the governor's office.  It took Pence until late March to do even his single exception, even after the cause of the outbreak had been clearly shown to be sharing needles a month or two earlier.  Pence maintained a belief for some time that a needle exchange would encourage drug use, despite no evidence to support this (in fact showing the contrary).  This is all from the NY Times article you cite above.  \n\nSo again, he did change policy (kinda), but it's baffling to me that he had to change at all.  In other words, why was he against needle exchanges at all?  If he had the authority to make an exception for this one county, why didn't he do it earlier when it was clear that sharing needles was the source of the outbreak?  Doing the right thing late is better than never, and I'm glad he was willing to change his mind.

We are a part of the universe.  Our planet is, indeed, floating around in space.  There are thus many contexts in which observing our planet makes *complete* sense to do from NASA (plus where the hell do those monitoring satellites float around- oh wait!).  Suggesting you want to shuttle this off to the NOAA (who I assure you, do not have real issues with the current arrangement either) is an unwanted solution at best and straight up nefarious at worst as an attempt to uproot the climate change community in multiple years of being shuffled around for no real purpose.\n\nNow, I'm going to agree that you have reason to argue a dozen points with too much hyperbole are not really productive.  But these first two on climate change are a legitimate enough concern that I would be *very* concerned about the future of our planet under a Trump presidency.

I realize this is r/Atheism and I'm agnostic myself, but come one. That ridiculous.\n\nThere is 0 evidence she wishes to push any of her religious agenda on public schools. She is a big believer on choosing where your child goes to school and I assume she will be anti-common core.\n\n**\"4) Lower salaries, yay.\"**\n\nAgain, biased article. I'll let Snopes show you why that is bullshit. I don't like scopes, but even a broken clock is right twice a day.\n\n> WHAT'S TRUE: A federal judge issued an injunction against a regulation put in place by the Obama administration that would expand overtime pay to millions of workers.\n\n> WHAT'S FALSE: The action was not taken by President-elect Donald Trump, and his ability to unilaterally do so is questionable.\n\nEven if he wanted to do that, he most likely wouldnt be able too. I\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/trump-to-strike-down-obamas-regulation-expanding-overtime/\n\nPlus, all of these business regulations are job killers. A business should not be forced to pay overtime to someone earning a salary. I honestly wish he would kill it. \n\n**5.)  \"Promote a guy to chief strategist who is basically a mouthpiece for racist idiots.\"**\n\nAgain, biased.\n\nDoes Breitbart report on the alt-right? Sure. \n\nI understand where people come from on this one. I hate the alt-right. The actual alt-right are racists. Fortunatley r/The_Donald is not alt-right.\n\nJust because a news organization reports on a horrible group of people does not mean that that company or its leader hold those views. Does CNN hold the views of black supremacists and Radical Islamists? Of course not. Do they hold the views of the man who tried to kill Trump back during the primaries? Of course not. \n\nAlso, there is 0 proof that Steve Bannon is a racist, anti-Semite, and white-nationalist.\n\nI'll let the anti-defamation league take care of this one.\n\n>\"WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY ANTI-SEMITIC STATEMENTS FROM BANNON.\n\n> While there is a long fact pattern of evidence that Breitbart served as a platform for a wide range of bigotry and there is some controversy related to statements from Mr. Bannon\u2019s divorce proceedings in 2007, we are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements made by Bannon himself.  In fact, Jewish employees of Breitbart have challenged the characterization of him and defended him from charges of anti-Semitism. Some have pointed out that Breitbart Jerusalem was launched during his tenure. \n\n> Nevertheless, Bannon essentially has established himself as the chief curator for the alt right. Under his stewardship, Breitbart has emerged as the leading source for the extreme views of a vocal minority who peddle bigotry and promote hate.\"\n\nhttp://www.adl.org/sp/stephen-bannon-backgrounder/bannon-backgrounder.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/\n\n**6.) \"Implement a tax plan that cuts taxes by 0.8% for the vast majority of people...oh...and 14%+ for the top 1%. Making a stand for the little man, just like he promised.\"**\n\nhttps://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/tax-plan\n\nAlso: Cutting taxes for the rich has been a Republican policy for ages. The way that it will work is if we de-regulate and audit the Fed. Luckily Trump holds those two positions. I'll let Peter Schiff explain.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AIew3RN4R4\n\n**7) \"Hand a powerful position to the current (super ineffective) head of the NSA...a man employees say has no leadership qualities.\"**\n\nHe hasn't picked this position yet. Is he on the list? According to the MSM and liberal media, yes. They've been wrong in all of their speculation for his positions thus far. \n\n**8.) \"Anti-legalization attorney general...conveniently that asshole's also a white supremacist. \"**\n\nOh for fuck's sake. There is 0 proof that Jeff Sessions is a white supremacist. Second: The Attoorney General does not set his own policies. He carries out the policies of the President. Trump has been a supporter of leaving the states up to Marijuana AKA he wants to legalize it. Jeff Sessions has been very loyal to Trump for the past year and a half because of his stance on Illegal Immigration. Making Marijuana legal is one of the first steps to chopping the head off of the snake that is illegal immigration. I'm sure that Sessions will follow Trump's lead.\n\n**9.) \"Wants to start a trade war with China which will drive up prices in the US and basically leads to everyone losing.\" **\n\nHas he ever specifically stated that he wants to start a trade war with China? That's a pretty polarizing statement. \n\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-art-of-the-deal-with-china-1479794162\n\nThis article is a lot less polarizing and factual. You should actually read it.\n\n**10.) \"Seems ok with child labour.\"**\n\nHoly fuck. You actually linked HuffingtonPost. Wow.\n\nShe has never said she is \"ok with child labor\".\n\nThe article that HuffPo links to clearly states that they would like to see 14-year-old kids work a couple hours a week at a grocery store or fast food restaurant so they understand the value of work before they enter serious education. They aren't suggesting that 10-year-olds work in a damn coal mine. These titles are shit and that is basically all you have been reading. \n\n**11.) \"Creationist VP who actually wants to teach that crap in schools\"**\n\nDeadState is worse than HuffPo. The Titles are extremely polarizing. He does not want to teach it in schools and hasn't ever denied Evolution.\n\n>The VP-elect may not have absolutely denied the phenomenon of evolution, but he has said that \"intelligent design provides the only even remotely rational explanation for the known universe.\"\n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/2016/11/13/mike-pence-evolution/\n\n**12.) \"Wants to end net neutrality.\"**\n\nThis is one of his stances I don't fully agree with him on, although I believe that regulations need to be cut from the internet. Net Neutrality is just a giant regulation and is horrible for creating competition.

It's meant that files being released have been mathematically, cryptographically certain to be the original files they had prepared for release. They have regularly digitally signed things as proof that Wikileaks is not compromised and is still operating with cryptographic certainty.\n\nIt's worth noting that when we talk about \"Wikileaks\", in reality we are talking about Julian Assange. He runs the show. When that twitter account says \"here's a mathematical proof of what's coming\", we know that this is a file Julian is handling himself. When Wikileaks signs something we know it is _Julian_ that has signed it.\n\nThis is a precaution. It means if anything should happen to him - and why shouldn't it? He is after all the subject of some rather intense surveillance and a lot of people would prefer him dead - then, well, people can't then pass off another file or another communique pretending this was what he had intended to release.\n\nThere are numerous timelines of events knocking around \"proving\" this means Assange is either in the hands of the CIA or is dead, but what this conversation in crypto is concerned with is the fact the maths around these files don't work any more.\n\nThat means the files that have been released are not the files that were planned for release. They have been altered or are completely different.\n\nOK, there are possible technical explanations for that, but Wikileaks hasn't done the \"look, we're still here, it's really us\" thing for a month either. And they've never fucked up like this before, either.\n\nI'm not sure about the theories going on about police raids at the Ecuadorian embassy, the prisoner transport plane (in some versions, a CIA renditions aircraft), that flew from London to North Carolina a few days after Kerry arrived in London and Assange was cut off, the various reading between the lines of Swedish prosecutors and Ecuadorian diplomats dancing in hallways or any of those things. \n\nHere is what everybody can mathematically be certain of:\n\n1.

The left *neeeeeeeds* to understand how desperately they *neeeeeed* WL right now. To get vindictive right now would set back whistleblowing by at least 15 years and who the hell knows what can be accomplished by an unchecked US government in that amount of time. Especially a US government that has no opposition party for at least 2 years. The implications are massive and cannot possibly be overstated.\n\nEdit for those calling for Assange's removal and damnation of WL: Think about what you are implying here. If the Chief Editor of The New York Times went missing suddenly on the heels of their nearly exclusive negative reporting on Trump, what should you think? How did you feel about the GOP trying to kill NPR in 2011? Should the US Government be participating \"eliminating\" political enemies in the press? There is a reason the Constitution protects people we disagree with. Because anytime you eliminate protections for your political opponents you erase your own protections and your side wont be in power forever. Seriously take a second and think about what you are saying.\n\nEdit: Sanders supporters take a long minute to think about eliminating the only source that showed how devastatingly effective the MSM was in the last ~18 months.

If all you have is a hash, the original data is gone. *But*, a hash can be used to verify that data hasn't been altered. For example, if I change a single letter in your comment (Say, changing the first \"C\" to an \"M\") the hash will be completely different:\n\n    f5a8765f5602ad5b88a785410624efc4\n\nThis is useful because I can release a file and tell people, \"the official file has the sha256 hash [blah blah blah]\" so that when they download it they can run the sha256 algorithm on the file. If it matches up with the hash that I released, they know it's the real version of the file. If anyone has altered so much as a single bit of the file the hash will be totally different and they'll know it's *not* the real file and has likely been tampered with or replaced.\n\nA lot of software developers will release hashes of their programs so that you can check that you haven't somehow gotten a sketchy virus-infested copy. I've also seen this done with audio and video files, so you can check to make sure the file hasn't been corrupted at some point.\n\nSo, the fact that the hash values released by Wikileaks aren't matching up with the files they released means that they are either totally different files, or they've been tampered with.

When someone buys into a company, they negotiate x amount for x% of the company post-investment, so you can just use ratios to figure out how it affects everyone else's percentages.\n\n**Round 1**\n\npre + inv = post; 10m investment for ~~30%~~51% (thanks /u/way2lazy2care)\n\npre + 10m = Post;\n51%/100% = 10m/Post;\npost = 19.61m;\n\npre + 10m = 19.61m\n\npre = 9.61m,\n\nWith no other investors, the founders have 49% of the company at this point, valued at 9.61m.\n\n**Round 2**\n\npre + inv = post; 50m investment for 30%\n\npre + 50m = post;\n30%/100% = 50m/Post;\npost = 166.67m\n\npre + 50m = 166.67m\n\npre = 116.67m\n\nThe founders and round 1 owned 49% and 51% of the company, respectively, and post-investment, they will own the same proportion of ownership that has not been transferred to round 2. With 30% going to round 2, that leaves 70% to split between founders and round 1.\n\nFounders: .7 x 49% = 34.3%\n\nRound 1: .7 x 51% = 35.7% \n\n**Round 3**\n\npre + inv = post; 100m investment for 15%\n\npre + 100m = post;\n15%/100% = 100m/Post;\npost = 666.67m\n\npre + 100m = 666.67m\n\npre = 566.67m\n\nThe founders, round 1, and round 2 owned 34.3%, 35.7% and 30% of the company after round 2.

If someone buys into the company at a lower price per share than they did, the price per share they pay is retroactively ratcheted down to the price the new investors paid. We don't have any prices per share, but anti-dilution is ubiquitous and you can use percentages and valuations as a proxy. Only Round 3 would be implicated, since all other rounds bought in at better price than the clinical people. Because the clinical round post value is half of round 3 post value, round 3 investors price becomes half of whatever it was, and this is taken out of previous rounds' percentages.

Why do that? Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Bayer, etc... These are established companies in a sector [whose average profit margins are on par with other top industries such as banking (we're talking >17-25%).](https://amp.businessinsider.com/sector-profit-margins-sp-500-2012-8) [Second Source](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/margin.html). Moreover these breakthrough companies with one product, such as Alexion rapidly recover their R&D. \n\nIf it's that much of a risk, why risk it in the first place? The answer is that it's not the R&D funding generally that they must recoup (they recoup that rapidly, and Alexion's margins will widen\u2014or bonuses/salaries will conveniently increase)\u2014because remember\u2014most pharmaceuticals [spend as much or more on advertising/marketing than they do R&D itself](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28212223). \n\nIt's that because of the nature of the industry, price-gouging is easily done. Because of patents you have 10-years exclusive access, and because it has to deal with life & death health, there's no pushback from consumers (they have no \"choice\" to shop around as [Steven Brill describes (Long PDF, but worth the read)](http://www.uta.edu/faculty/story/2311/Misc/2013,2,26,MedicalCostsDemandAndGreed.pdf)), and hardly any from government\u2014as the very documentary where this comment is under describes.\n\nThe reason generics are cheap isn't simply because they made a knock-off without putting in the dirty work, it's largely because there *now* exists *true* competition. Alexion **at their peak** put in around $317 million in R&D in 2013. Their *quarterly* sales for the drug were over $400 million by September of that same year and they've continued to rise... And let me remind people that for pharmaceuticals, once research is done, manufacturing is absurdly cheap in comparison. There exists comparatively little overhead in production compared to other industries thereon. Alexion itself was valued at *34 billion dollars*.\n\nYeah they have to throw some money into clinical trials in addition to what they take from public spending on healthcare research, true. But once they find a breakthrough, it's a pure racket with *no* constraints whatsoever.

They spent $622 million on direct to consumer advertising (TV, radio, magazine ads).  This is the thing that most jumps to mind when people hear \"Marketing\".  There are estimates that drug companies spend ~7x marketing to physicians as they do to consumers (training sessions, reps to try to inform the physicians about the new stuff, etc).  So combined marketing to consumers and physicians is ~$5 billion.  \n\nNow, how much did Pfizer spend on R&D in 2012? Their R&D budget was $7.9 billion.

[Some discussion on this](http://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/does-pharma-spend-more-on-marketing-than-r-d-a-numbers-check).\n\nDepending on what you include in \"marketing\", and how you process the numbers, you can come up with a wide range of results (see, the WashingtonPost article linked, which I think falls for both the SG&A trap, and also includes the advertising for companies like Johnson & Johnson, so is including their soap and shampoo advertising in it as well.).  Is one of them more accurate than the other?  Not really, as far as I can tell.

This guy *directly* benefits from the cost of high drugs, true or not. \n\nWhat I find odd is that the people defending the industry (from \"drug developers\" like this individual to most certainly front-line pharmacists whose 6-figure income depends on these inflated prices) seem to lump these failed companies in with the successful ones. Why do that? Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Bayer, etc... These are established companies in a sector [whose average profit margins are on par with other top industries such as banking (we're talking >17-25%).](https://amp.businessinsider.com/sector-profit-margins-sp-500-2012-8) [Second Source](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/margin.html). Moreover these breakthrough companies with one product, such as Alexion rapidly recover their R&D. \n\nIf it's that much of a risk, why risk it in the first place? The answer is that it's not the R&D funding generally that they must recoup (they recoup that rapidly, and Alexion's margins will widen\u2014or bonuses/salaries will conveniently increase)\u2014because remember\u2014most pharmaceuticals [spend as much or more on advertising/marketing than they do R&D itself](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28212223). \n\nIt's that because of the nature of the industry, price-gouging is easily done. Because of patents you have 10-years exclusive access, and because it has to deal with life & death health, there's no pushback from consumers (they have no \"choice\" to shop around as [Steven Brill describes (Long PDF, but worth the read)](http://www.uta.edu/faculty/story/2311/Misc/2013,2,26,MedicalCostsDemandAndGreed.pdf)), and hardly any from government\u2014as the very documentary where this comment is under describes.\n\nThe reason generics are cheap isn't simply because they made a knock-off without putting in the dirty work, it's largely because there *now* exists *true* competition. Alexion **at their peak** put in around $317 million in R&D in 2013. Their *quarterly* sales for the drug were over $400 million by September of that same year and they've continued to rise... And let me remind people that for pharmaceuticals, once research is done, manufacturing is absurdly cheap in comparison. There exists comparatively little overhead in production compared to other industries thereon. Alexion itself was valued at *34 billion dollars*.\n\nYeah they have to throw some money into clinical trials in addition to what they take from public spending on healthcare research, true. But once they find a breakthrough, it's a pure racket with *no* constraints whatsoever. And a lot of people question the ethical implications of that\u2014is that really okay? \n\nThe risk that they *chose* to take in pursuing a promising (or not promising) product does not warrant their price-gouging thereafter. \n\n", "id": "dari6lu"}], [{"comment": "This exact topic has made bestof at least three times now.

In the [discussion on Wikipedia about race and IQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence#Validity_of_race_and_IQ), the question is why it happens, not whether it happens. Self-identified blacks are one standard deviation lower in IQ in the US. This is not \"of practically no predictive value\". If you are looking for people to do a job that requires, say, an IQ above 140, you'll have a higher fraction of whites meeting the bar than blacks. Specifically, if we assume both groups have the same standard deviation of IQs, and whites are the average, then the [probability distribution](http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/iqtable.aspx) says you'll have 0.4% of the whites passing the bar and 0.02% of the blacks.

Self-identified blacks are one standard deviation lower in IQ in the US. This is not \"of practically no predictive value\". If you are looking for people to do a job that requires, say, an IQ above 140, you'll have a higher fraction of whites meeting the bar than blacks. Specifically, if we assume both groups have the same standard deviation of IQs, and whites are the average, then the [probability distribution](http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/iqtable.aspx) says you'll have 0.4% of the whites passing the bar and 0.02% of the blacks.

Racists citing racial differences often appear to be excited about the fact that the means are different numbers, period, whether the difference is statistically significant or not. Moreover, statistical significance is hardly the threshold for an important difference (more on that below). What matters in this case is the biological significance of the size of the difference, especially relative to the variance in the distribution.\n\nTo phrase it technically, racists (if they were smart enough to know the terminology) would argue that the intelligence distribution of a person's race could be used as a Bayesian prior by which to initially and strongly judge the individuals' intelligence. And my argument against racism is that this prior is so uninformative as to be practically useless in comparison to the other data you can instantly acquire about the person from signals they're choosing to send. For example if you see a black guy in a suit sitting in a chair working on an equation next to a white guy in a crooked MAGA trucker cap, you can draw some tentative conclusions about their relative intelligence from their actions. Race is completely uninformative relative to all the other, obvious factors on which people can be easily evaluated every day.\n\n>Statistically, if the means of 2 groups are statistically different, then based on that definition alone, the difference in means between the groups is LARGER than the variances within the two groups, and the difference cannot be from chance alone\n\nThis isn't how statistical significance works.

Aragorn crosses Ringl\u00f3. An army from the Morannon takes Cair Andros and passes into An\u00f3rien. Frodo passes the Cross-roads, and sees the Morgul-host set forth.\n\n> 11\tGollum visits Shelob, but seeing Frodo asleep nearly repents. Denethor sends Faramir to Osgiliath. Aragorn reaches Linhir and crosses into Lebennin. **Eastern Rohan is invaded from the north. First assault on L\u00f3rien.**\n\n> 12\tGollum leads Frodo into Shelob\u2019s lair. Faramir retreats to the Causeway Forts. Th\u00e9oden camps under Min-Rimmon. Aragorn drives the enemy towards Pelargir. The Ents defeat the invaders of Rohan.\n\n> 13\tFrodo captured by the Orcs of Cirith Ungol. **The Pelennor is overrun.** Faramir is wounded. Aragorn reaches Pelargir and captures the fleet. Th\u00e9oden in Dr\u00faadan Forest.\n\n>  14\t Samwise finds Frodo in the Tower. Minas Tirith is besieged. The Rohirrim led by the Wild Men come to the Grey Wood.\n\n> 15\tIn the early hours the Witch-king breaks the Gates of the City. Denethor burns himself on a pyre. The horns of the Rohirrim are heard at cockcrow. **Battle of the Pelennor.** Th\u00e9oden is slain. Aragorn raises the standard of Arwen. Frodo and Samwise escape and begin their journey north along the Morgai. **Battle under the trees in Mirkwood**; Thranduil repels the forces of Dol Guldur. **Second assault on L\u00f3rien.**\n\n> 16\tDebate of the commanders. Frodo from the Morgai looks out over the camp to Mount Doom.\n\n> 17\t**Battle of Dale.** King Brand and King D\u00e1in Ironfoot fall. **Many Dwarves and Men take refuge in Erebor and are besieged.** Shagrat brings Frodo\u2019s cloak, mail-shirt, and sword to Barad-d\u00fbr.\n\n> 18\tThe Host of the West marches from Minas Tirith. Frodo comes in sight of the Isenmouthe; he is overtaken by Orcs on the road from Durthang to Ud\u00fbn.\n\n> 19\tThe Host comes to Morgul Vale. Frodo and Samwise escape and begin their journey along the road to the Barad-d\u00fbr.\n\n> 22\tThe dreadful nightfall. Frodo and Samwise leave the road and turn south to Mount Doom. **Third assault on L\u00f3rien.**\n\n>  23\t The Host passes out of Ithilien. Aragorn dismisses the faint-hearted. Frodo and Samwise cast away their arms and gear.\n\n> 24\tFrodo and Samwise make their last journey to the feet of Mount Doom. The Host camps in the Desolation of the Morannon.\n\n> 25\tThe Host is surrounded on the Slag-hills. Frodo and Samwise reach the Sammath Naur. Gollum seizes the Ring and falls in the Cracks of Doom. Downfall of Barad-d\u00fbr and passing of Sauron.\n\nThe armies of Mordor were vast enough to simultaneously attack Minas Tirith, Rohan, Mirkwood, launch three assaults on L\u00f3rien, and besiege Erebor, all pretty much at the same time.

To not empathize and to listen is to risk vitriol and a vituperative backlash, which IMO is not dissimilar to what we see with the trans movement. \n\nI want to state firmly that I'm not equating trans people with white nationalists.

Can anyone name one thing all white people in this country share? I really don't feel white pride. I feel regional pride, but I don't share this with white people exclusively. I think its fine if you have pride in your heritage, but I think its disingenuous to label it white pride, because its attempts to unify too many people with disparate backgrounds. I identify much more with probably any black man from my home city that happens to root for the same sports team than some white country boy who's primary hobby is hunting on the weekends.

I was born and raised in America.  I identify myself as a white American male.   My lineage is just a passing curiosity which I've never bothered to explore because how would that defined me now ?  I honestly think it's ludicrous when people suggest that blacks not knowing what tribe they came from in Africa somehow  is a crushing blow to their culture and overall success.   Black Americans have created their own culture and it's fine to be proud of that but the same should be true of white Americans who have done the same.\n\n"], [57, "Does the guy know there are black people not from Africa?\n\nNot to mention there have been plenty of white slaves in history...hard to appreciate what might be a valid point if it's buried in crap"], [50, "\"a white who takes pride in his ancestors\u2019 accomplishments is evil, but a white who refuses to accept guilt for his ancestors\u2019 sins is also evil.\""], [38, "Most of American culture is white culture. When we like aspects of another culture we appropriate them and pretend they're ours (see Rock and Roll, Jazz, all of modern dance, etc). We even learn about our roots as white roots in school. Civilization started in the Tigris/Euphrates basin moved to Greece, Rome, and Europe, then came to America. African-Americans who descended from slaves are a side story to the great American story. What about all the Asian immigrants and their descendants? Native Americans? African immigrants and descendants? Cajuns and Mexicans were bought or won in wars until recent history. All these groups are added in later as their ancestors came to America.... but they had full rich cultural histories of their own. How many modern day Americans can really trace their ancestry to the Mayflower or any of our other early colonies? I sure can't.\n\nI say all this because I recently had a challenge that made me uncomfortable. I'm studying Korean language at a university here, and one of our writing assignments was to tell a national folktale from our country in Korean. I could only think of European tales like Cinderella, Snow White, and Rapunzel or Iroquois tales like How Bear Lost His Tail. Either option seemed like a bad choice for me. I'm not Native American, but I grew up on Iroquois land. Could I use their story? Is that cultural appropriation? I am white, but I'm not from Europe.

(I'm not racist so please read on).  \n\nI think the main difference when you hear a lot of folks talking about white pride/heritage they are talking about their Anglo Saxon roots.  It is funny in a way because OP stated that most folks in the states can have cultural heritage.  \n\nThis is what changed my mind on that.  My ex was a 100% German national.  She often commented on how folks would come up to her and say \"hey, I'm German, my ancestors were from there\".  Well thats all good and dandy, but do you speak a word of the language? Do you know where in Germany your family came from?  How about how long ago?  Most folks (just like OP stated about African Americans) don't truly know where they came from, just a generalization.  \n\nNow imho when folks in the states are talking about white pride, they are talking about their WASP heritage.  They are talking about a Nationalistic identity. (I dare a single person to say that the US isn't a very nationalistic country).  Some of the folks I've talked to just feel that the amount of African American movements, holidays, and pride festivals are disproportionate to holidays that white Americans have.  Honestly I can think of Columbus day (Which even this is bad because this man was HORRIBLE, but it's never taught this way).  Maybe Thanksgiving as well.  Other than that, there really are no more that celebrate the WASP heritage.  \n\nI'm all for whatever people personally want to celebrate.  Be it their various ancestral heritage, their skin color, religious affiliation, really whatever you want to celebrate; I say go for it.  \nNow what I don't agree with is when white pride becomes blatant racism.  I believe all folks are equal.  Once you start stating that the white race is superior to the blacks, Indians, Jews, et al; then thats when you just become a racist asshole.  If you aren't racist and want to celebrate the shit out of being white go for it.  Just don't bring in that noise about superiority.  "], [29, "What the actual fuck?

White pride is pretty much exclusively associated with racism and oppression of minorities in the US, though lately some people that are questioning why 'white pride' is a bad thing if racial identity politics is mainstreaming such politics across the board.

That isn't going to be happening anytime soon, so 'white pride' is something that now will pretty much come down to attacking minorities for trying to redress their real social grievances, while white people really don't have a racially based set of grievances other than perhaps being made fun of in media and certain social cultures; that ain't something to be organizing a 'white pride' movement around.

However; I kinda have my own take from the opposite side of this.  (I'm not racist so please read on).  \n\nI think the main difference when you hear a lot of folks talking about white pride/heritage they are talking about their Anglo Saxon roots.  It is funny in a way because OP stated that most folks in the states can have cultural heritage.  \n\nThis is what changed my mind on that.  My ex was a 100% German national.  She often commented on how folks would come up to her and say \"hey, I'm German, my ancestors were from there\".  Well thats all good and dandy, but do you speak a word of the language? Do you know where in Germany your family came from?  How about how long ago?  Most folks (just like OP stated about African Americans) don't truly know where they came from, just a generalization.  \n\nNow imho when folks in the states are talking about white pride, they are talking about their WASP heritage.  They are talking about a Nationalistic identity. (I dare a single person to say that the US isn't a very nationalistic country).  Some of the folks I've talked to just feel that the amount of African American movements, holidays, and pride festivals are disproportionate to holidays that white Americans have.  Honestly I can think of Columbus day (Which even this is bad because this man was HORRIBLE, but it's never taught this way).  Maybe Thanksgiving as well.  Other than that, there really are no more that celebrate the WASP heritage.  \n\nI'm all for whatever people personally want to celebrate.  Be it their various ancestral heritage, their skin color, religious affiliation, really whatever you want to celebrate; I say go for it.  \nNow what I don't agree with is when white pride becomes blatant racism.  I believe all folks are equal.  Once you start stating that the white race is superior to the blacks, Indians, Jews, et al; then thats when you just become a racist asshole.

For one thing, none of the original \"hipsters\" (I'm speaking of the latest movement, not beatniks) would have identified themselves as such. Nor would you have heard such a cohesive value statement from them (\"It's all about authenticity, man!\").

In my opinion, hipsters are not genuinely searching for authentic culture, but are seeking superficial means to cope with the stress of an identity crisis caused by having no authentic culture.\n\n\n>Hipsters are all about conflating their personal identity with their consumption of material goods and entertainment. Since their sense of personal identity stems from and doesn't run much deeper than their clothing, hairstyle and favourite bands, it's necessary to choose these things as esoterically or ironically as possible to distinguish themselves from others. In a modern world where everyone on the planet seems to be wearing nikes, drinking starbucks and reading harry potter- the superficial hipster seeking differentiation from others wears decorated chuck taylors, drinks independent organic fair trade and reads jonathan saffron foer.\nThis is a simplification, but think of this: Are hipsters actually known for having their fingers on the pulse of an authentic culture, and for knowledge of the best things of the recent past? No. They're known for being contemptuous of others for enjoying things that are more mainstream. People with a shaky personal identity always need other people to scorn in order to feel better about themselves.\n\n\n>I say that hipster culture is superficial because A) it's always reactionary to popular culture, which means it's defined by that which it scorns and B) because it is in all aspects impermanent, it can be lost or stripped of value in a moment, a hipsters affiliation with their culture might not survive from one haircut to the next.\nHipster culture is sick and doomed from the start, for reasons mentioned above, beause if it appropriates anything genuinely good (which subsequently catches on) it becomes un-hip. To drink out of a mason jar because it's reusable, as a rejection of commercialism, is OK. To drink out of a mason jar because it's cool to be seen rejecting commercialism, is the height of commercialism. The only difference between a hipster and any other overly materialistic person is that the hipster is concerned with asserting their uniqueness (rather than their beauty or wealth as number one priority).\n\n\n>Therefore, in my opinion, hipsters are united not by what they wear and do (because the intent behing these actions is significant and variable), but by a common thread of superficial, materialistic self-identification, and a fear of becoming mass-produced clones as a result of cultural consumption. The real irony is that since most hipsters are in truth suffering identity crises, they are perpetually looking for examples to follow precisely in how not to be an inauthentic copy."], [34, "sure, the original thread is 4 years old, but...\n\nthe word for which the OP was seeking is commodification - bothered me "], [14, "Hipsters fetishize authenticity as a form of rebellion against rampant commercialization and the questionable motives of billion dollar companies.

Young people (in their 20's and 30's) in big cities don't seem to have a lot of disposable income right now. However, people that age want nice things still. So what do they do? They buy things that are cheap, rugged and aesthetically pleasing all at once. Mason jars can be bought by the flat (or just recycled from old jam jars or whatever) for very little money, and serve as driving vessels and food storage. They're also glass, which will last longer, and look and feel, better than plastic food containers or glasses. Work clothes, like plaid, may cost a little extra compared to H&M, but they last a lifetime and can be bought second hand if need be. Why shave with a four bladed Gillette when you can buy a safety razor for 30 or even 50 bucks and spend pennies on new blades instead of 20 dollars for 2? Getting an old stereo amp, some used speakers, and a decent used turntable can be a couple hundred dollars, but if you do your research you might be able to get better sound than the 300 dollar Bluetooth speaker The Source is trying to sell. Fixed gear bikes came from used track bikes, which were well made racing machines no one wanted. For way less money than the newest mid to low range options most people were buying you could get a solid, reliable machine that worked really well. And yes, micro-brew beer is more expensive than Budweiser, but you can fill a growler for less money than you might think and the quality of beer is way better.\n\nNot all of this stuff is still cheaper than the alternative, but so many of the things that are seen as \"hipster\" now were, at least in the beginning, just things that young adults with little disposable income looking to have something nice could afford. And of course, old stuff wasn't always made better, but it's old. The shitty stuff doesn't last, so often what's still working now was made well and will continue to last.

I think that the only thing I would add, is that in addition to frugality, much of the \"hipster\" movement is centered around niche things that somebody somewhere was passionate about, often maybe even being exposed to it because of frugality in the first place.   \n\nCraft breweries didn't spring up because they were hip, they sprung up because people who got into homebrewing decided they loved it enough to make a go of it professionally, when they might have just started brewing at home because it was a cheap way to make a lot of decent beer. Same thing with all the handcrafted things the OP was talking about. Handmade boots, jewelry, etc. Can't afford nice name-brand stuff? Make your own.   \n\nCouple that with the rise of the internet, and you get sites like Etsy, where people can sell their wares without having to host their own webpage; or reddit/Pinterest, where you can find very specialized communities that geek out over stuff they like together. r/goodyearwelt and r/streetwear are great examples.  \n\nThe OP from 4 years ago talked about \"authenticity,\" but never talked about passion. It is far easier in this day and age to get information about anything you're interested in, and you can source materials from all over the globe. To me that's the most defining thing about hipsters.

I don't know how many times someone, jokingly or not, has called me a hipster. I've got a cupboard full of mason jars, a few with handles, arranging in whatever sizes. I love my tea and my coffee in them, no other reason, and i love finding them in weird thrift stores or salvation armies... just like all of my other random coffee cups. I also am a rural southerner. My family has been farming for generations. I was one of the first to get out of dodge and go to college in a big city, Chicago. With me, I took my experiences and my hand me downs. My dads harley shirts are a staple in my wardrobe. They're made out of great cotton and have held up for 20-30 years and still soft as ever. Plus, eagles and motorcycles. He also happened to hand me down his vinyl collection. Not because I think records are cool, but i actually appreciate classic rock from the 60s and 70s as well as current genres I enjoy that are still being printed on vinyl. I'd much rather look through my records and choose what I want to listen to with my record player and stereo receiver, not because it is \"authentic,\" but because that is just one form of audio. And while its quite clear and crisp, youll also find me plugging my computer into it and browsing iTunes, or watching movies from it, or even the DVD player. But you won't find me watching VHS. Like the rest, yeah, it may be outdated. But it's not convenient like choosing a high quality record over going through thousands of mp3's on a screen. It's about curation, and caring about lost arts and time. I'm constantly worrying about lost time. So to appreciate it, I love decorating with random antiques and collectibles from the cultures I come from as well as others I never knew about until leaving home for college. People have always said coming to my apartment or house is like a museum trip. You'll find curated areas in my house dedicated to Native American textiles and arts, Asian pottery, statues, and paintings, Victorian artifacts, trunks, and art, Southwestern and rural farm antiques.. Anything and everything that i appreciate aesthetically, i find a way to incorporate into my home. I love estate sales and auctions, but I also love big brand consumer stores. I have furniture from Ikea, shop frequently at Target and Walmart, household electronics from Best Buy, have both windows and Mac computers for my career (photo/design, ironically ~hipster~), drink a shitty beer or a good beer now and then, but won't be found at a Whole Foods wasting my pay check. I love to save money, I love to be frugal. I check Craigslist for something I need before shelling out money for something brand new. I don't spend money when I have to, and the thing that works out best is that my entire house is full of things that get the job done for the right price while pleasing my aesthetic and interests. But if all you get out of that is \"authenticity,\" then you're reading into it too much. This was how I was raised and how my kids will be, too. I appreciate having the ability to learn about the world and know I wasn't the first person to be touching these things that still have meaning and use in an age where NEW and EXPENSIVE doesn't always mean correct or convenient. \n\nBut I'm just over here sipping my Folgers out of this huge mason jar with a handle..

In my opinion, hipsters are not genuinely searching for authentic culture, but are seeking superficial means to cope with the stress of an identity crisis caused by having no authentic culture.\n\n\n>Hipsters are all about conflating their personal identity with their consumption of material goods and entertainment. Since their sense of personal identity stems from and doesn't run much deeper than their clothing, hairstyle and favourite bands, it's necessary to choose these things as esoterically or ironically as possible to distinguish themselves from others. In a modern world where everyone on the planet seems to be wearing nikes, drinking starbucks and reading harry potter- the superficial hipster seeking differentiation from others wears decorated chuck taylors, drinks independent organic fair trade and reads jonathan saffron foer.\nThis is a simplification, but think of this: Are hipsters actually known for having their fingers on the pulse of an authentic culture, and for knowledge of the best things of the recent past? No. They're known for being contemptuous of others for enjoying things that are more mainstream. People with a shaky personal identity always need other people to scorn in order to feel better about themselves.\n\n\n>I say that hipster culture is superficial because A) it's always reactionary to popular culture, which means it's defined by that which it scorns and B) because it is in all aspects impermanent, it can be lost or stripped of value in a moment, a hipsters affiliation with their culture might not survive from one haircut to the next.\nHipster culture is sick and doomed from the start, for reasons mentioned above, beause if it appropriates anything genuinely good (which subsequently catches on) it becomes un-hip. To drink out of a mason jar because it's reusable, as a rejection of commercialism, is OK. To drink out of a mason jar because it's cool to be seen rejecting commercialism, is the height of commercialism. The only difference between a hipster and any other overly materialistic person is that the hipster is concerned with asserting their uniqueness (rather than their beauty or wealth as number one priority).\n\n\n>Therefore, in my opinion, hipsters are united not by what they wear and do (because the intent behing these actions is significant and variable), but by a common thread of superficial, materialistic self-identification, and a fear of becoming mass-produced clones as a result of cultural consumption. The real irony is that since most hipsters are in truth suffering identity crises, they are perpetually looking for examples to follow precisely in how not to be an inauthentic copy.", "id": "dacft50"}, {"comment": "i disagree that this is a better explanation, since it's based on the premise that all hipsters are shallow.  i do believe it applies to some hipsters, but certainly not all.  in order to better define what a hipster is, it needs to be acknowledged that this group of people has many different, conflicting facets.  assuming that every member of this group is reactionary is basing a definition on a false pretense.", "id": "dacms3x"}], [{"comment": "sure, the original thread is 4 years old, but...\n\nthe word for which the OP was seeking is commodification - bothered me ", "id": "dacg4l9"}], [{"comment": "Hipsters fetishize authenticity as a form of rebellion against rampant commercialization and the questionable motives of billion dollar companies.
