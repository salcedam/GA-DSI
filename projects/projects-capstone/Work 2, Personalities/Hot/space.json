You can't use the Earth for a gravity assist in Earth orbit, and you can't use the sun for a gravity assist in solar orbit. You would leave with exactly the same amount of orbital energy you approached with.\n\nThis is untrue -- it would take more delta-v to crash into the sun than it would to escape the solar system. This is a simple calculation you can do yourself if you want; I'm just quite tired and have a midterm tomorrow. If you managed to put yourself on a trajectory straight into the sun, you would actually be in an interstellar hyperbolic orbit (assuming you missed the sun by a small margin). What body would you be orbiting? Not sure, maybe the galactic core...\n\nAnyway, point is that since it takes more energy to put yourself on a crash course to the Sun than it does to escape the Sun's SOI, you will indeed end up with hyperbolic excess velocity that would allow you to use the Sun as a \"gravity assist\".\n\nNOW, if you just took off from LEO and burned retrograde to the Earth's velocity vector until your perihelion was in the direct center of the sun, you would indeed still be orbiting the sun. But, OP specifically said you'd be launched at a fast speed directly toward the sun. If you do that, you're gonna miss the Sun; that's orbital mechanics 101.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat you can take away from this is that I'm just an astronautical engineer being *extremely* pedantic hahahah.

Escaping the solar system from a solar orbit equal to the Earth's takes about 6000 m/s, or 6 km/s. \n\n\nAnyway, hitting the Sun is hard because we're currently moving sideways around it at around 30 km/s. To fall towards and hit the Sun, you need to cancel out that 30 km/s of orbital velocity. You can do it directly, by building a very capable rocket, or you can use gravity assists, which involves being accelerated from the Sun's frame of reference by approaching a gravity well in motion relative to the Sun. If you do it right, your momentum relative to the Sun is transferred to the planet you approached. Since you're essentially getting this change in velocity for free, it only costs you the change in velocity required to get onto that encounter trajectory, hence a much smaller number. When it comes to gravitational assists, the deeper the gravity well and the faster the source of gravity the more effective the slingshot effect. A black hole travelling near the speed of light would make a very excellent gravity slingshot for example, but Jupiter does a good job as well. In fact Jupiter is an effective enough slingshot that you'd only need one pass to end up falling directly towards the Sun, as long as you were on the correct approach to Jupiter. \n\n\n\n", "id": "dap266g"}]]], "5fzdci": ["Progress cargo spacecraft malfunctions en route to the ISS and crashes in an uninhabited area in Siberia.", "2016-12-02 00:41:14", 9, "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/progress-space-station-cargo-ship-likely-lost/", [], []], "5fzxh8": ["In Orion's Shadow", "2016-12-02 02:17:55", 13, "https://i.redd.it/vqu9ym1cg11y.jpg", [[2, "About a third in from the right and about a quarter down from the top is Orions belt"], [1, "Where is Orion.

The second stage had to burn for much longer than anticipated, and had to pitch way up to avoid falling back to Earth too quickly. It probably took 100 m/s more to insert into orbit on that mission than what the mission profile should have due to that software issue because of the extra gravity losses.\n\nthe 9,400 m/s commonly said to be the amount of delta v to reach LEO is the typical vacuum delta v for an orbital rocket.

The technology that VG developed for this endeavour will also prove incredibly valuable to them for their launcher one program, which has the potential to end up being a very affordable small satellite launcher", "id": "daqwc6y"}, {"comment": "Firstly, suborbital tourism is a dead end. Its a novelty, nothing more, once orbital flights become cheap enough the suborbital market will die because theres not much to do in a tiny box for 10 minutes. And their particular design isn't useful for orbital missions (not even as a technology demonstrater, like New Shepard).\n\nSecondly, their price estimates are completely insane. They're talking about tickets costing 250k per person. New Shepard costs \"in the low thousands of dollars\" to refurbish between flights according to one of Blue Origins recent videos. Even if fuel and range costs triple that, and the worst case scenario for what \"low thousands\" means, thats still ~30k per flight spread across several people and unmanned experiments.

Theres no point in spending money on a flight that lasts less than 10 minutes and doesn't go anywhere.

If their refurbishment cost is that low relative to manufacturing cost, each can probably last for dozens of missions. I'd be very surprised if VGs refurbishment costs are anywhere near that low either, refurbishing their hybrid main engine alone will probably be hundreds of thousands to low millions of dollars per flight (yet another reason hybrids are the worst conceivable option for an engine.

While the images were not guaranteed to show the damage, the capability existed for imaging of sufficient resolution to provide meaningful examination.

Also, it would have had the exact same flaw (foam shedding) that killed Columbia, which had never been properly analyzed, so they didn't know what the risk was of it happening again. *Also*, neither crew would have had any time to train for the transfer between Shuttles, which would have used a jury-rigged setup and been the most dangerous EVA operation ever even with trained crews.\n\nIn the actual event, they never investigated the foam strike properly and never had to make this decision, but would you have rushed to launch a second Shuttle?

Again from Wikipedia, referencing the Columbia Accident Investigation Board report:\n\n>However, Atlantis was well along in processing for a planned March 1 launch on STS-114, and Columbia carried an unusually large quantity of consumables due to an Extended Duration Orbiter package. The CAIB determined that this would have allowed Columbia to stay in orbit until flight day 30 (February 15). NASA investigators determined that Atlantis processing could have been expedited with no skipped safety checks for a February 10 launch. Hence, if nothing went wrong, there was a five-day overlap for a possible rescue.

It certainly would have needed a skilled pilot to maintain close station keeping with Columbia while the crew EVA'd over.\n\nOne of the big differences between American and Soviet/Russian manned spacecraft historically is that all American spacecraft since Gemini have required piloting to accomplish their missions while Russian spacecraft are designed to operate automatically with piloting as a backup option. As a matter of fact, the US has *still* not deployed an automated docking system, something that the Russians developed in the 1970s! This isn't to denigrate the US approach at all - I think it actually works better in most cases, and that the Russians were hampered during the Space Race by their insistence on automation.", "id": "dam1jhz"}, {"comment": "At what point do they pilot because there is definite automation in shuttle flight with computers doing the bulk during take off and shuttle roll?  ", "id": "damr49s"}, {"comment": "Keep in mind most of the \"piloting\" takes the form of giving the computer the correct instructions via the flight computers. I think the only times the Shuttle is truly hand-flown is during close rendezvous and station keeping, docking, and the final gliding flight to landing (although I believe the first reentry was totally hand-flown if you can believe it).\n\nWith that out of the way, launch is definitely 100% automated through main engine shutdown. I'm not sure if circularization requires astronaut input into the flight computer-- I'd bet it doesn't but I don't know. I'm pretty sure orbit tuning and rendezvous are directed by astronaut-entered computer commands; I'm not sure if Houston could enter those commands from the ground if they needed to. Reentry burn is probably a similar situation.\n\nAn interesting question is launch aborts-- I know the commander can initiate an abort anytime they want (not so on Soyuz), but I'm not sure if their input is required to successfully initiate an abort. It's a bit of a moot point, though, since for any abort except abort to orbit (shooting for a lower-than-planned orbit), their piloting skills will be needed in short order to land the thing in any case.\n\nFor Apollo, I think all the maneuvers were of the \"type it into the computer\" sort except for docking and the final portion of the lunar landing (which I think was theoretically automated but all the astronauts chose to do manually). I don't think Houston could operate the computer from the ground for Apollo. Translunar injection almost certainly fully automated with no manual computer input required.\n\nSo yeah, I'm unsure about a lot of things, but American spacecraft were more piloted than most people probably think.", "id": "damt7l8"}, {"comment": "Thank you for the response.", "id": "damuv32"}, {"comment": "Russia was the first to demonstrate automated space docking, in the 90's.\nSecond is the European ATV (automated Transfer Vehicle)\n\nInternational Docking Adapter is just recently being installed.

Eventually Helium burning in the core stops while Hydrogen burning still occurs in a shell around the core. As this Hydrogen burning proceeds it builds up Helium in a shell, Helium fusion under these conditions has a strong positive feedback loop, so when Helium burning begins in the shell it \"flashes\" over rapidly, building up lots of latent heat quickly. This process causes the outer layers of the star to expand rapidly, throwing lots of mass out into interstellar space as well as cooling the shell of the star and stopping Hydrogen fusion. Eventually the Helium burning reaches the layers of Hydrogen and the temperature increase ignites Hydrogen fusion (before consuming all of the available Helium), kicking off the multi thousand year cycle all over again. Stars lose a lot of mass through this process (more than half). After that, stars that aren't massive enough to collapse in a supernova evolve into a white dwarfs. Fusion stops in the core but the star continues to heat up due to gravitational contraction. This heat creates intense stellar winds which drive off much of the mass of the star that isn't under electron-degeneracy pressure conditions.\n\nInterestingly, all of the known white dwarf stars are fairly massive, even though white dwarfs can be fairly small.

Finally, the neutron star won't get to any heavy elements, because, for all intents and purposes, it is a giant nucleus (with the density of an atomic nucleus).\n\n> If you had a large enough pure iron core could you reach a new fusion epoch? or is that age a rapid explosive one towards a neutron star? or would it merely explode as dust (H/He) tunnels through the iron because of the massive energy potential driving it to the center where it ignites and becomes a star?\n\nSimple answer: no. The fusion reaction for iron is *endothermic*, meaning that it takes energy away from the star. Sure, the core tries to fuse iron (temperatures can be ~10^10 K in the core of a massive star just before death) and you will find heavier elements, but as soon as the core begins Fe fusion it collapses within seconds into a Type II supernova. As for the H/He in the core, you find none. At those temperatures it is immediately fused into heavier elements. \n\nKeep in mind stars that massive have different burning shells. They will fuse in the core, but other fusion reactions can take place some radius away from the core due to the temperature gradient. So while the core may be in a silicon burning phase, there may be a shell some radius away from the core going through a He burning phase. The heavier elements produced by that shell will sink down and be fused by, say, a C burning shell via triple alpha...\n\n> Neutrino mass is apparently insignificant in the universe but they must slowly form flows as they weakly interact with one another, would it be possible for them to form stars?\n\n(Again, my particle physics knowledge is nil!) It is unlikely that neutrinos interact with each other, and they certainly cannot form a star. There would not be anything to fuse and therefore create light pressure, so it would not be in hydrostatic equilibrium. It's also important to note that we still know next to nothing about neutrino mass.\n\n> If a star, possible a quark star, whatever quarks actually are that they compose matter at specific ratios, what should a black hole burn/convert? gluons? bosons? some force modulator we don't know that determines some factor of spacetime?\n\nI don't quite understand this question, but a few things. First, disregard quark stars until we observationally confirm them...which will never happen. They have a radius below the Schwarzchild radius and therefore should be treated as black holes. Now, the \"burn/convert\" part I take to be asking what fusion process keeps black holes up...which is none. Stellar remnants (neutron stars and white dwarfs) undergo *no nuclear fusion*, instead they are held up by degenerate pressure (neutron and electron, respectively).\n\n Think about a black hole as something that doesn't exist. Kind of like we can see dinosaur footprints, but they don't exist anymore, We can see the footprint of the black hole (the event horizon and the accretion disk) but there is nothing to know about the \"hole\" itself, aside from mass (through gravitational interaction), charge (through particle interaction), and rotation (by observation). \"Black holes have no hair.\"\n\n\n", "id": "dakjibr"}], [{"comment": "Question about the EM Drive.

I hear Neil Tyson and supposedly clever people talking like this, too, but eh... just makes no sense at all to put it that way. 97% similar in DNA, maybe, but that small percentage has unlocked such vast amounts about us that we've been able to build on it over time (standing on the shoulders of giants) to create modern civilisation and all of our advancements in science and art and everything else.\n\nSo we could be just 1-3% \"different\" but from that we have gone from being 100% more to 500% more to 1,000,000% more without our DNA even changing significantly over that whole period.\n\nTo think that a few extra % necessarily would unlock even more potential just doesn't stand up to reason. Even if a human was given 10x or 100x the brain power as the rest of us, they wouldn't necessarily become disinterested in music and art and fiction and they would still have insane amounts to learn from the rest of humanity for the rest of their lives. We are diverse of mind, we specialise, and we grow in so many ways.\n\nAny alien species more advanced than us genetically could easily be very very interested in us, regardless of that gap.\n\nAlso, there could even be other factors that work universally to stop this gap growing beyond a certain point. For example once human civilisation (both science and society) got to a point where we started to \"patch up\" genetic issues with medicine and social care and everything else, it's arguable that we have have stopped evolving in any particular (advancing brain power, for example) direction now, because we've reached a point in progress where it's no longer selected for evolutionarily.\n\nNow we don't know for sure because we don't have anything to compare with, but it could EASILY be that this situation is COMMON amongst life when it gets to a certain point in civilisation. Maybe it's not? Maybe it happens every single time? Who knows.\n\nI find it pretty annoying when I see supposedly clever people thinking so closed-mindedly on topics like that, as if they've already figured out the answer or something.
