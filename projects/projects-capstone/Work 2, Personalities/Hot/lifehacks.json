Epsom salt baths can do wonders for an achy back. \n\nI'm not sure how you sleep but you may need to start putting a pillow between your legs if you sleep on your side or one under your knees if you sleep on your back. If you sleep on your stomach you need to stop today. Sleeping on your stomach is NOT good for your spine.\n\n3 Days of excercise really isn't going to do much. You'll need to be consistent for a month or two to build up strength in your core and your back.\n\nI know all of this because I was a production welder who worked 12 hours a day 5-6 days a week. I regularly lifted several thousand pounds a day of steel because I built tractor parts. I had back pain like you wouldn't believe. I have an office/field work job now but I still take care of myself. You have to take care of yourself whatever you do. If you really can't get this back pain solved you need to see a specialist. I had to do it when I pulled my back out and he gave me an extra strength anti-inflammatory medicine for a month. Another thing I can recommend if you can afford is a deep tissue massage. I pulled my back out last August in 15' and couldn't walk right. I went to see a massage therapist and they went to town on my back. I walked in limping and ran out skipping. \n\nHope all this helps.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI thought of two more things. I think you should subscribe to the fitness reddit and ask what you would do for back pain. They can provide you with detailed answers to what you need.\n\nSecond, I had extremely bad back pain to the point where I had sharp pain. I could not stop talking about it. If you're in pain and constantly talking about it you need to change the way you talk about it. I don't know if you believe in psychology but if you don't I'd still like you to try this for your benefit. Instead of saying, \"My back hurts today\" you need to say, \"My back feels great and it's getting stronger every day.\" There is a lot of positive good this will do to your mind because even though your pain might still exist you will \"feel\" better. I know it sounds rediculous but eventually if you're lied to enough you start to believe it.

Think of it as physiotherapy. \n\nSpeak to a professional because you might be surprised by how weak certain muscles are and how much other muscles are overcompensating.

"], [3, "Hey, im also 26 and spend almost all of my days in front of a pc. Im not a doctor, but:\n\n* For the eyes and headache i heard from someplace to regulate my screen brightness - so that the brightness of the screen would be the same as the surroundings. Now, minimum brightness is very bright in most OS-s. On Linux one can make a custom script to adjust it more precisely (i can explain further if youre interested). There is also software to regulate brightness automatically, but i havent tested those yet.\n* About half a year ago i started using my laptop on a \"standing table\". At first my back got tired really quickly and i could go at it for less than 15 minutes. But over the months (need some persistence) my back muscles got stronger and now i can stand for several hours on most days. I also use my pc while sitting often. I believe that change or variety is very important. Youre unlikely to find one perfect posture that wont harm you no matter how long you sit/stand in it. So variety will help you probably. Now im not a rich guy so i didnt buy anything new and fancy for mounting my laptop. I use a cardboard box (a very stable one) and at places other than my home where ill be staying longer than a day, i usually build something out of tables and nightstands and such. Getting the right height is important. Ive heard that your head should be tilted downwards slightly (maybe up to 45 degrees) and arms (from elbow) parallel to the ground. Im more certain in this than the previous point of advice.\n* So that your wrists wouldnt get tired you can use a fancy ergonomic keyboard and a mousepad with a cushion, or in my ghetto solution - a scarf will do (for another pc i use underwear and a glove :D ). \n* If you use your computer an hour or 2 before sleep, i also recommend getting some software for [reducing the blue light](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side).

I definitely recommend addressing it, just trying to ignore it can result in you unable to walk (happened to an acquaintance). Also if your eyes are still strained after having balanced brightness for hours, you might need glasses.

Now, minimum brightness is very bright in most OS-s. On Linux one can make a custom script to adjust it more precisely (i can explain further if youre interested). There is also software to regulate brightness automatically, but i havent tested those yet.\n* About half a year ago i started using my laptop on a \"standing table\". At first my back got tired really quickly and i could go at it for less than 15 minutes. But over the months (need some persistence) my back muscles got stronger and now i can stand for several hours on most days. I also use my pc while sitting often. I believe that change or variety is very important. Youre unlikely to find one perfect posture that wont harm you no matter how long you sit/stand in it. So variety will help you probably. Now im not a rich guy so i didnt buy anything new and fancy for mounting my laptop. I use a cardboard box (a very stable one) and at places other than my home where ill be staying longer than a day, i usually build something out of tables and nightstands and such.

I have followed these tips for years and I have much fewer periods of pain now, and many days with none at all. Hope they help you.\n\n* Make sure you get up and [stretch on your breaks](https://airawear.com/index.php/blog/shoulder-stretches/).  If my back is currently paining me, then between breaks, at least once an hour I take a moment between calls or tasks to stand and stretch just for a few seconds. If you have a chance while waiting for your caller to complete their password change or they put you on hold, that's a perfect opportunity.\n* If you wear glasses, please update your prescription regularly. Ask your eye care professional about [computer vision products](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=computer+eye+strain+glasses); nice information [here](http://coopereyecare.com/eye-problems/computer-eye-strain/) on computer eye strain.\n* Desk height should be so that when you're typing, your elbows are at 90\u00b0 angle.\n* Sit with you feet flat on the floor, in front of your hips, and the seat height so that your thighs are horizontal; you want to avoid seat height so high you're feet barely/don't touch the floor and you cut circulation. If you sit forward a lot, and are able to bring in your own chair to the office, check out [kneeling](https://www.amazon.com/Mobile-Wooden-Ergonomic-Kneeling-Fabric/dp/B000TMFSQK) [chairs](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-kneeling-chair.html)\n* Most will say to keep the seat back upright, but you can set it to be slightly reclined, but just enough so that when you lean back, you're not reclining.\n* Your monitor height should be set so center-screen is at least as high as your nose. Don't go too high, but to look up at your display will pull your head and shoulders up; a lower monitor will make you hunch over more.\n* Look away from your monitor for several seconds periodically, to allow your eyes to change focus. this will help a bit with headaches.\n", "id": "da6dwyh"}, {"comment": "Thanks, and I'll try these!", "id": "da6id7l"}], [{"comment": "There are these back stretches my mom taught me called Egoscue, and they work wonders for back pain.

Can you raise /lower the height of your chair,  and can you adjust its recline angle? If so,  change your position every half hour or so.  \n\nSecond the complex,  build muscle and stretch.  Those saying weight training is important are right. Those saying stretches and stuff like yoga are right too. But it has to be full body and you have to be smart and intuitive,  don't only isolate a couple of areas, remember everything is connected. \n\nI couldn't sweep my kitchen without feeling like my right shoulder was going to fall off the next day. I weight trained and things like military press helped a lot, but flys made it worse so I don't do those. My foot hurt a lot for awhile, turns out it was my tight right quad- with lots of stretching and foam rollers and massaging knots with a lacrosse ball my foots all good. I had headaches you wouldn't believe,  turns out it was my tight neck muscles.  Yoga. I have intense lower back pain after I sit for more than about 45 minutes, I'm still working on this one but planks seem to be the one exercise that I can confidantly say make a huge difference. \n\n\nSo try things out and stick with them for a couple weeks, long enough to really gauge their suitability for your needs.

It's one thing to be so sore the next days that it takes you a full minute to rise from a chair,  but feeling like you might cry/break trying to stand is a big problem.

Then lean your upper body in the direction of the leg.\n\nThis should stretch your hamstrings and you will probably feel it along the back of your leg/behind the knee.

I mean...seriously? Who likes that drink?\n\nSo the question is, if I come up to you and say \"I'd like two oz of (insert a decent whiskey I see on the wall behind you), with 1/2 oz of simple syrup and a dash or two of bitters\" does that offend you?

When i'm busy (or hell slow) i don't want to take an order then make it and bring it to you and tell you how much it is then wait for you to find your card (what's that oh you left it in your bra...thanks that's nice and slick) or dig your crumpled wad of cash out of your pocket then watch you unwad it and count it out then hand me a stack of still half folded money that i then have to flatten out so it can go in the register (what's that oh you have to dig out change too?). You know you've come to purchase something, please be ready to pay. I and the other patrons will appreciate it. \n\n-Don't piecemeal your order. If you're ordering for yourself and you forget that one extra thing when i bring your drink back i get it. but if you're ordering for a group (or if you're with a group all about to order) give me the entire order. i do this for a living and unless each drink is some overly complex mess (oh you want half a shot of this and half a shot of that mixed with pineapple and just a splash of cranberry with 1 and a half cherries yadda yadda) i can make 4 or 5 things and bring it back. Don't order one drink then another when i get back then another when i get back. if at any time i feel like that's all i can remember i'll just say something like 'ok be back with those then we'll move on.'\n\n-Don't order drinks that are particular to that one bar in your hometown then act surprised or dejected that i don't know what it is or how to make it. If you're at a bar you've never been to either ask to see a drink menu or order what i call 'liquor mixer.' that's exactly what it sounds like....vodka tonic, whiskey ginger, etc. \n\n-if you're tight on funds and are running a tab, don't be afraid to either tell me a limit you'd like to stick to or simply ask how much your tab is (and certainly ask how much your beer/drink is). Don't drink all night then ask to close out and be shocked at the bill. I'm not your mother or your accountant. you order something and i give it to you and charge you. \n\n-i don't get this too much but...don't tell me you don't like a beer i just opened or a shot i just poured and ask to 'return' it. i can't put the shot back in the bottle and i can't recap the beer. If you haven't tasted something and are unsure about it, ask a friend or two if they'd consider splitting the cost of said beer/drink/shot. If you're alone maybe strike up a conversation with a stranger and make a friend. \"hey i've never tried this before, have you? you wanna split the cost of one?\" \n\n-Don't call the bartender over to you. Believe me i want to serve you. i work on tips and the more people i serve the more potential tips i'm going to make. I've found that most people that want to know my name when they come in and call me by name over the bar the moment they decide they want something typically don't tip...or at least don't tip well enough for me to be at their beck and call. If you're ready to order watch the bartender. wait until they look in your direction and either try to make eye contact and nod or wave. having money visibly in your hand is also a good idea (back to the first tip....it lets me know you're very ready to order). If you've been waiting a long time with no service then watch to see what your bartender is doing. as long as they are working, give them time to work, they'll get to you. i've found that when busy most bartenders tend to move in a line along the bar. If they're not busy and are staring at their phone or tv then tip accordingly (or not if they've been real shitty). also be aware of where you might be sitting or standing. the bar i work at is an island bar....like i stand in the middle of the room with a bar 360 degrees around me. There are definitely a couple places where you can sit or stand that i can either not see you or easily overlook you. if you feel like that might be possible move to where you know that you can be seen. \n\nthat's all i can think of right now but if i think of more i'll try to remember to add it.

When i'm busy (or hell slow) i don't want to take an order then make it and bring it to you and tell you how much it is then wait for you to find your card (what's that oh you left it in your bra...thanks that's nice and slick) or dig your crumpled wad of cash out of your pocket then watch you unwad it and count it out then hand me a stack of still half folded money that i then have to flatten out so it can go in the register (what's that oh you have to dig out change too?). You know you've come to purchase something, please be ready to pay. I and the other patrons will appreciate it. \n\n-Don't piecemeal your order. If you're ordering for yourself and you forget that one extra thing when i bring your drink back i get it. but if you're ordering for a group (or if you're with a group all about to order) give me the entire order. i do this for a living and unless each drink is some overly complex mess (oh you want half a shot of this and half a shot of that mixed with pineapple and just a splash of cranberry with 1 and a half cherries yadda yadda) i can make 4 or 5 things and bring it back. Don't order one drink then another when i get back then another when i get back. if at any time i feel like that's all i can remember i'll just say something like 'ok be back with those then we'll move on.'\n\n-Don't order drinks that are particular to that one bar in your hometown then act surprised or dejected that i don't know what it is or how to make it. If you're at a bar you've never been to either ask to see a drink menu or order what i call 'liquor mixer.' that's exactly what it sounds like....vodka tonic, whiskey ginger, etc. \n\n-if you're tight on funds and are running a tab, don't be afraid to either tell me a limit you'd like to stick to or simply ask how much your tab is (and certainly ask how much your beer/drink is). Don't drink all night then ask to close out and be shocked at the bill. I'm not your mother or your accountant. you order something and i give it to you and charge you. \n\n-i don't get this too much but...don't tell me you don't like a beer i just opened or a shot i just poured and ask to 'return' it. i can't put the shot back in the bottle and i can't recap the beer. If you haven't tasted something and are unsure about it, ask a friend or two if they'd consider splitting the cost of said beer/drink/shot. If you're alone maybe strike up a conversation with a stranger and make a friend. \"hey i've never tried this before, have you? you wanna split the cost of one?\" \n\n-Don't call the bartender over to you. Believe me i want to serve you. i work on tips and the more people i serve the more potential tips i'm going to make. I've found that most people that want to know my name when they come in and call me by name over the bar the moment they decide they want something typically don't tip...or at least don't tip well enough for me to be at their beck and call. If you're ready to order watch the bartender. wait until they look in your direction and either try to make eye contact and nod or wave. having money visibly in your hand is also a good idea (back to the first tip....it lets me know you're very ready to order). If you've been waiting a long time with no service then watch to see what your bartender is doing. as long as they are working, give them time to work, they'll get to you. i've found that when busy most bartenders tend to move in a line along the bar. If they're not busy and are staring at their phone or tv then tip accordingly (or not if they've been real shitty). also be aware of where you might be sitting or standing. the bar i work at is an island bar....like i stand in the middle of the room with a bar 360 degrees around me. There are definitely a couple places where you can sit or stand that i can either not see you or easily overlook you. if you feel like that might be possible move to where you know that you can be seen. \n\nthat's all i can think of right now but if i think of more i'll try to remember to add it.

Use a fucking fork to guide the wire on to the hook.

I've had no problems with wireless support using Mint 17.3. Which version of Mint did you use?\n\nI no longer recommend Ubuntu for two reasons. The practical reason is that Unity, the desktop environment the distro is organised around, uses more memory than any other GNU/Linux desktop (see [comparison graph at the bottom of this blog post](https://l3net.wordpress.com/2013/03/17/a-memory-comparison-of-light-linux-desktops/)). Unity is probably ok for computers released with Windows 8 and above, but won't work on an XP computer, and won't work well for long on a Vista computer before you have to start doing the [distro switch dance](https://l3net.wordpress.com/2013/03/17/a-memory-comparison-of-light-linux-desktops/). Mint with Cinnamon works fine on my laptop (2GB RAM, came with XP), and with the lighter Mate desktop I expect it would work on a 1GB RAM computer, for quite some time.\n\nThe second reason is political. The Ubuntu distribution (including trademarks and copyright) are controlled by Canonical corporation, not by the Ubuntu community.  Like any corporation, Canonical are structurally obliged to put making money before serving Ubuntu users, and as a result, they have often been bad actors; bundling proprietary cloud hosting with the distro (\"Ubuntu\" One was proprietary at the back end), chucking in spyware (Amazon Lens), and so on. Mint is controlled by the Mint user community and I find that inherently more trustworthy.\n\nFinal point, I'm only recommending Mint for GNU+Linux beginners. Once you get familiar with the things that are different on a GNU+Linux system, and how to diagnose and fix stuff if it doesn't work out-of-the-box, I would recommend trying a 100% free code distro like Trisquel (like Mint, a community-led remix of Ubuntu).\n\nEDIT: added Mint version info, fixed typo", "id": "d9candg"}, {"comment": "Good points, thanks for the info.", "id": "d9cngkm"}], [{"comment": "Any pc that can run Vista can run Windows 7 and much better.

Brake cleaner generally comes in two varieties, chlorinated (which is non- flammable) and non-chlorinated (which is flammable).

The aerosol versions usually contain CO2 as their propellant.\n\nThe chlorinated versions are primarily perchloroethelyne (aka tetrachloroethylene). The non-chlorinated versions are primarily heptane. In both cases, these are the active ingredients whose job it is to break down and strip away sticky automotive oils, greases, and baked-on lacquers. Which is why it was so efficacious at relieving OP's problem - it simply had the industrial strength needed to break down and strip away the residual globules of urushiol that hand soap and water failed to sluice away.\n\n*Some* brands (the kind in the trigger bottles) can contain alcohol as a dispersant, but that is not what strips the oils. It's strictly a carrier meant to increase the active components' distribution and coverage, and then quickly disappear. Alcohol is not a strong solvent of oils, and would have done little or nothing to strip the ivy's residual toxins, because it would have simply re-deposited any suspended oils back onto the skin, when it evaporated. In fact, following your suggesting might have made the discomfort a darn sight worse, by thinning and dispersing the oil over non-contaminated skin.\n\nBut if it *was* an ingredient in the actual brake cleaner OP used, it may have served to sterilize any open sores or scratches before it fully evaporated, further reducing irritation, and aiding in the dramatic overnight healing. \n", "id": "d9px7hf"}, {"comment": "Thank you", "id": "daqn01r"}, {"comment": "I tried rubbing alcohol.

This sounds counter productive, but it really isnt. A large percentage of park guests are season pass holders or guests visiting on a multi day pass. When it rains, these people are more likely to stay home and just go another day. Lines are much shorter on rainy days. Also, most of the major rides at Disney are indoors. Space Mountain, It's a Small World, Matterhorn, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. Rain makes no difference to these rides. Parades will go on in the rain, but fireworks may be cancelled.\n\nGet there early, go to the busiest ride first and right after getting off, head over to your next biggest ride and get a fast pass for it. That cuts the 2 biggest lines of the day right there.\n\nWeekdays are best. September and January are their slowest months.\n\nIf you can, head over to guest relations and tell them it is your birthday/anniversary/first time (even if it's not). They will give you a special pin. It doesn't do much, but you (or your child) will be more likely to be picked as a volunteer for parades and shows and have characters visit you while dining.\n\nFantasmic is a great show. I don't think you need to find a seat as early as everyone says, a half hour will do fine. \n\nBetween sundown and park closing is the next best time for lines. Most people have small children who are tired and asleep by the time the sun goes down and start to leave the park. If you can muscle your way through to the end, lines will be short. Many people will do the park early morning, leave for lunch and rest at their room, and come back around 4-5pm. This avoids the biggest crowds and the hottest part of the day.\n\nStay hydrated, I've seen quite a few people faint from the heat at Disney. They allow outside food and beverages. Feel free to pack a picnic lunch and extra water bottles (no glass).\n\nEnjoy\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention. Disney has single rider lines. These are lines meant for single riders to fill in loose seats when the line is full of parties of 4-6 people. Use this to your advantage.

"], [24, "Cruises sound terrible after reading these tips."], [10, "Not sailed with RC, both my experiences were with Norwegian Sky.\n\nMy top tip: Figure out which excursions you want to take *well in advance* of your cruise date, then *the moment you board*, go to the booking desk and sign up for them, before you even check out your room. And try to get into the boarding lineup reasonably early. The closer you are to the front, the more tour options you will have to choose from. \n\nYour room will still be there an hour later; the free pi\u00f1a coladas will still be there an hour later; the pool will still be there an hour later; the reggae band will still be there an hour later. But both the Stingray Encounter and the Dolphin Experience will be long gone. So act fast. Then head to the pool to catch some rays, because the corridors will still be crowded with people trying to find their rooms, and the pool deck will never again be this empty. Dig your sunscreen out of your day bag (you *did* pre-pack a day bag, didn't you?) and relax.\n\nNo. 2: Use your first few days to check out all the restaurants, then pick your favourites and patronize them exclusively. There's not much worse than being turned off your cruise experience because on the last full day, through ennui and lack of planning, you defaulted  to the casual cafeteria - where you found noisy, undisciplined children running wild, your fellow passengers loud, drunk and opinionated, the buffet dirty and the food cold. Strive to take home good memories of good dining experiences, instead - especially on the last few days.\n\n\nNo. 3: Don't turn up your nose at the seemingly \"filler\" entertainments, like the morning beginner's yoga, the afternoon magic shows in the theatre, or the free bingo. Stuff like the yoga will offer you new experiences you'd *never* contemplate trying back home, because it would mean laying down 20 bucks and/or driving somewhere. Because they're the underdogs, the afternoon performers often make a *great* effort to be entertaining, and they're approachable when you spot them on deck a day or two later.  And I actually won a $500 cruise line gift certificate at bingo - which came in handy when we won a cruise on that same line, as a door prize for an unrelated charity auction, six months later.\n\nNo. 4: be generous to the staff, especially the wait staff and your room attendant. Tip early, tip generously. These people usually make slightly less than dick divided by squat, so a generous offering on both of your first two days will make them *extremely* open to requests out of the routine."], [8, "We did basically the same excursions available through the cruise line for much cheaper by setting up and planning them ourselves.

Because they don't go through the cruise line, you don't have a ton of people overwhelming the place. \nIf by value you mean \"how can spend the least amount of money\", bring your own booze by sneaking it on board with Rum Runners.

And try to get into the boarding lineup reasonably early. The closer you are to the front, the more tour options you will have to choose from. \n\nYour room will still be there an hour later; the free pi\u00f1a coladas will still be there an hour later; the pool will still be there an hour later; the reggae band will still be there an hour later. But both the Stingray Encounter and the Dolphin Experience will be long gone. So act fast. Then head to the pool to catch some rays, because the corridors will still be crowded with people trying to find their rooms, and the pool deck will never again be this empty. Dig your sunscreen out of your day bag (you *did* pre-pack a day bag, didn't you?) and relax.\n\nNo. 2: Use your first few days to check out all the restaurants, then pick your favourites and patronize them exclusively. There's not much worse than being turned off your cruise experience because on the last full day, through ennui and lack of planning, you defaulted  to the casual cafeteria - where you found noisy, undisciplined children running wild, your fellow passengers loud, drunk and opinionated, the buffet dirty and the food cold. Strive to take home good memories of good dining experiences, instead - especially on the last few days.\n\n\nNo. 3: Don't turn up your nose at the seemingly \"filler\" entertainments, like the morning beginner's yoga, the afternoon magic shows in the theatre, or the free bingo. Stuff like the yoga will offer you new experiences you'd *never* contemplate trying back home, because it would mean laying down 20 bucks and/or driving somewhere. Because they're the underdogs, the afternoon performers often make a *great* effort to be entertaining, and they're approachable when you spot them on deck a day or two later.  And I actually won a $500 cruise line gift certificate at bingo - which came in handy when we won a cruise on that same line, as a door prize for an unrelated charity auction, six months later.\n\nNo. 4: be generous to the staff, especially the wait staff and your room attendant. Tip early, tip generously. These people usually make slightly less than dick divided by squat, so a generous offering on both of your first two days will make them *extremely* open to requests out of the routine.", "id": "dan2phq"}], [{"comment": "We did basically the same excursions available through the cruise line for much cheaper by setting up and planning them ourselves.

It took me 28 years but forgiving him was one of the best decisions I ever made and has taken a tremendous weight off of my shoulders. It's a long story, more than I know how to type out in this response to your post but I'll try my best to describe what I believe and how it works.\n\nI believe the key concept to grasp regarding forgiveness is \"absorption\".  \n\nI believe if you really want to forgive someone then it requires aborbing the wrongdoing that is done to you by displaying two things: \n\n1. Grace, giving them what they don't deserve. \n2. Mercy, not giving them what they do deserve.\n\nThis means when my dad shouts obscenities at me my response had historically ben shutting down and repressing how much it hurts, angers or saddens me. However, now I find myself responding with patience, displaying the aforementioned grace and mercy:\n\n1. I display grace in the form of compassion, in that I wonder what led him to this place in his life that he would he would think he needs to scream at his children? The phrase,  \"Hurt people, hurt people\" is true. What hurt did my dad go through and how can I, by extending grace to him in his failings, hope to see my dad come out of such a dark place? Without showing my dad grace in his mistakes I have no hope of our relationship improving or healing.\n2. I extend mercy to my father because I've made the conscious effort to not hold his wrongdoing against him but instead to use it as fuel to better love him as his son in hopes that one day we might reconcile and actually have a healthy father-son relationship. When my dad fails me, if I always gave him what he deserved then it would mean I didn't talk to him anymore and our relationship would cease. I don't want that, I don't want my dad to be my enemy\n\nI believe that by absorbing the failures and wrongdoing of your \"enemies\" and in response extending grace and mercy you can forgive them and improve your relationships.\n\nI think you can forgive someone even if they never change. However, reconciliation isn't possible unless both parties are involved. So to conclude with my same example, my Dad might always be the same way and we may never reconcile but I don't have to carry around the weight of bitterness towards him."], [19, "It's not your fault."], [15, "Forgiveness isn't about the other person, it's about you.

The first is a short term fix, and it's one that has come to me second hand. Consider the \"enemy\" and what this person has done to wrong you. Then consider what kind of apology you want that person to give you. Not just having that person say 'sorry'. Consider the specific words you want that person to say, the specific things you want that person to apologize for. In a nutshell, imagine the perfect apology. What would that person have to say to you to make you completely forgive him or her?  \n\nOnce you have considered that, write it down. Then, you will take that paragraph and visualize that person giving that apology to you. Fully immerse yourself into this visualization. Daydream it, and fall deeply into this daydream. Let the picture in your mind be as clear as if it you are simply remembering something that happened yesterday.  \n\nAnd then, wake up from this dream.  \n\nTest subjects who underwent this type of visualization reported stronger feelings of wellbeing afterwards. It makes sense: an apology does not change the person, the listener or the situation. Not in any physical, 'real' way. But we often take an apology as evidence of some kind of internal change, whether or not that internal change has actually occurred or not.  \n\nLike I said, it is something that I heard second hand, and is not something I have used often.  \n\nThe second strategy is to practice a kind of meditation. I don't like the word meditation, because it has a lot of connotations attached to it. Instead, think of it just as taking control over your thoughts. Our minds can often be bedlam. Intrusive thoughts randomly pop in and out. A weird, dark urge beckons you in front of an oncoming train, or off the ledge of a balcony. Cringeworthy moments in our past suddenly pop into our minds for no reason. Temptation, obsession and addiction smolder and burn.  \n\nBut you can get ahold of your mind, and tamp down the strange, impulsive and multitudinous voices that populate it (including the ones that keep you ruminating on this enemy). Practice thinking about nothing. Practice thinking about the thoughts that pop into your head. Practice by letting go.  \n\nYou'll be bad at it at first. But keep practicing. Keep letting go. Eventually, one day, you will be able to take the transgression, pick it up with your fingers, along with the pain that it has caused you, and you can look at it and decide whether to keep it, or whether to toss it aside. Pain may be all you have left of your interaction with that enemy.

Don't look at what they did as right or wrong/good or bad, but just what caused them to do that. A lot of bullies lash out because of their own personal problems, maybe their parents were getting divorced and they were very angry, their anger wasn't appropriately managed since they acted out towards you, but they were trying to cope with the pain.

I'm wasting my time and my energy carrying all of this hate.  I could be using that energy to try and fix what is wrong instead of just putting more hate out into the world.

I had this idea in my head that forgiveness meant absolving them of their shitty behavior or hurtful actions, pretending it never happened, that people who deserved forgiveness were people who apologized or at the very least felt some remorse, and that as long as I held on to my anger or resentment, they weren't \"off the hook\" for what they'd done.\n\nSo, instead of viewing forgiveness as symbolically saying \"It's okay that you did this to me and never acknowledged your wrongdoing or apologized for hurting me.\", I had to consciously re-learn what it meant and say, instead, \"You fucked up, your actions, intentionally or not, hurt me, I've felt my feelings about it and maybe your behavior still affects me, but I'm not going to let anger and resentment eat away at me as well. I no longer care whether you feel remorse, I forgive you.\" \n\nI never had to confront people with this, I did have to say it out loud to myself a few times, but it has helped me immensely in letting go of pain that I was unnecessarily causing myself. My emotional investment is valuable to me, and I get to decide what I spend my time caring about. I decided I no longer have the time to agonize over whether the people who abused me in my past feel sorry for what they did, because I've left them behind and it's up to them to decide what kinds of people they'll be going forward. It's up to me to heal as a person and treat myself and others with respect.\n\nI also realized that I'm an adult and a free person and I don't have to associate with people who do shitty things to myself and others. I may have to work with these people, be related to these people, or be in the same room with them, but I don't have to let them into my life and invest myself in their actions. \n\nThis isn't a perfect solution, and it's not easy.

In your dream some thing *accepts the role* of being *the bad guy* and does something horrible in the dream to make you hate that guy. Then, you wake up from that dream just as angry as while you were asleep. \n\n\nLook back and analyze the bad guy character. First, that character is just a manifestation of your mind in your sleeping dream, and/or the dream of reality. That Character is volunteering to do something shitty and evil in *your* dream, in *your* mind, in order for you to feel and experience emotions. Anger, or fear and bravery when confronting your enemy, or satisfaction (or possibly the lack of) when being victorious over your enemy are all *feelings*. For some reason, this is what reality is attracted to creating, an illusion to manifest emotions, vice versa. \n\n\nWe are all reflections of ourselves. The enemy rival is specifically tailored into your reality to invoke an emotion, in order to get a response, to create a story in our lives.  Good and bad are perceptions that are subjective. Your 'bad guy' reflection is a reflection of your personal beliefs, hence why the arch enemy is so good at drawing out emotional responses in you. \n\n\nWhat needs to be reminded to ones self is it is just a dream no matter how real it is. Those bad guys, politicians, and other things that are so obviously ridiculous are all there in your dream to create a narrative, a story, or *a human experience for you, as a spirit*\n\n\nHow to forgive: \nThere are only two beliefs here. The Bad Guy in your dreams is either you, or it is not. If it is you, then you are creating your own story obviously. If it is not, then it is an external *entity, who has willingly chosen to be a bad guy in your movie for you to play in so you can feel like the good guy.* Which means, that bad guy who does such an amazing job at pissing you off should receive an Emmy award for best actor for playing the role as the evil doer in your movie. \n\nLife is as magical as it is scientific, it will play both cards to shape your reality to extract the most emotional response, good or bad, it is perception. \n\nHow to remove the 'bad guy'\nIf the bad guy is a reflection of you, you must learn something from them, or about yourself. That bad guy is a concept, if you remove it from you reality, for example, by moving to another city. Another 'bad person' will appear in your new environment, until you have solved or accepted whatever lesson is to be learnt from that experience. \n\nIf you ask the bad guy \"are you real?\", it will likely use whatever beliefs you have to say yes. It may respond with intimidation techniques to distract your thought process of 'is it even real?' to 'uh oh, fight or flight!'. If it were to tell you \"no, I am not real, just a figment of your imagination\", your story would stop being believable. It is like you as Luke asking Vader, \"are we in a movie?\". It would destroy the movie, like it would with a viewers reality. \n\nPeople are saying it is not your fault, *it is your fault*, everything is. As a spirit having a human experience, you are responsible for everything in your movie. With that perspective comes power and responsibility, One has the capacity to change things in ones own reality. Maybe with this perspective you can see life more as a game, and shift your focus to 'How to win' this game, and not be worried, angry, or scared.\n\nYour options are infinite, meditation is a place to start.

How do I love someone who lacks love for me or intends to do me harm?\n\nHis answer was startling to me. He said \"give freedom, liberate them\".\n\nEssentially, if you perceive something or someone to be wrong in anyway, concede them freedom to be wrong, and even surrender yourself to their freedom, if it has been transgressed already. If it happened, you allowed it to happen. If you were some where else it wouldn't happened the way it did, so it was your will to allow that person to wrong you! to free yourself of any anguish caused by their actions, concede that person your intentional consent for them to have their freedom, even if it means they could potentially do you wrong again! \n\nNow your own freedom is yours to decide if you allow it to happen in the future again, but by removing all notion of control over that person, be in in guilt, moral, emotional, financial or any type of debt, that person is no longer a personal issue. they are free to do as they wish.

You have to compromise at some level. whatever wrong was done to you will never be undone in the past, you can however, undo what damage it is still doing this very moment. Its a mental framework, you need to build an internal moral net for your thoughts, to have a floor to land on and argue yourself out of the downward spiral when you feel yourself going down that path.\n\nAll the points I made about personal freedom are simply a thought exercise in 'I wouldnt do to them what I dont want done to me\". If you were wronged, would you say you wanted to be wronged against? probably not. thus, you would not want to have your freedom transgressed. You would say 'no' now that you know the negative outcome that has already transpired, but you likely had something else you were gambling on back when the even happened that made you decide it was worth risking the negative outcome. It didnt play out the way you wanted it to. nothing is perfect and nothing is guaranteed. You lost that time. Youre still sulking over that time you lost, and that just prolonges your emotional 'death'. Youre commiting yourself to purgatory for not giving up on your loses and stopping throwing good money after bad.\n\nBack to the freedom thought. Knowing that you would not want to be wronged, would you then find it fair to wrong another person? Even if it was the person that wronged you? Wouldn't that make you just as bad as them, and thus both deserving of your masochistic exchange in punishments? that's the key to the 'the greater man forgives first'. THAT is why he is the greater man, because he is aware that if he forgives first, he frees HIMSELF from guilt.

It's a long story, more than I know how to type out in this response to your post but I'll try my best to describe what I believe and how it works.\n\nI believe the key concept to grasp regarding forgiveness is \"absorption\".  \n\nI believe if you really want to forgive someone then it requires aborbing the wrongdoing that is done to you by displaying two things: \n\n1. Grace, giving them what they don't deserve. \n2. Mercy, not giving them what they do deserve.\n\nThis means when my dad shouts obscenities at me my response had historically ben shutting down and repressing how much it hurts, angers or saddens me. However, now I find myself responding with patience, displaying the aforementioned grace and mercy:\n\n1. I display grace in the form of compassion, in that I wonder what led him to this place in his life that he would he would think he needs to scream at his children? The phrase,  \"Hurt people, hurt people\" is true. What hurt did my dad go through and how can I, by extending grace to him in his failings, hope to see my dad come out of such a dark place? Without showing my dad grace in his mistakes I have no hope of our relationship improving or healing.\n2. I extend mercy to my father because I've made the conscious effort to not hold his wrongdoing against him but instead to use it as fuel to better love him as his son in hopes that one day we might reconcile and actually have a healthy father-son relationship. When my dad fails me, if I always gave him what he deserved then it would mean I didn't talk to him anymore and our relationship would cease. I don't want that, I don't want my dad to be my enemy\n\nI believe that by absorbing the failures and wrongdoing of your \"enemies\" and in response extending grace and mercy you can forgive them and improve your relationships.\n\nI think you can forgive someone even if they never change.

The first is a short term fix, and it's one that has come to me second hand. Consider the \"enemy\" and what this person has done to wrong you. Then consider what kind of apology you want that person to give you. Not just having that person say 'sorry'. Consider the specific words you want that person to say, the specific things you want that person to apologize for. In a nutshell, imagine the perfect apology. What would that person have to say to you to make you completely forgive him or her?  \n\nOnce you have considered that, write it down. Then, you will take that paragraph and visualize that person giving that apology to you. Fully immerse yourself into this visualization. Daydream it, and fall deeply into this daydream. Let the picture in your mind be as clear as if it you are simply remembering something that happened yesterday.  \n\nAnd then, wake up from this dream.  \n\nTest subjects who underwent this type of visualization reported stronger feelings of wellbeing afterwards. It makes sense: an apology does not change the person, the listener or the situation. Not in any physical, 'real' way. But we often take an apology as evidence of some kind of internal change, whether or not that internal change has actually occurred or not.  \n\nLike I said, it is something that I heard second hand, and is not something I have used often.  \n\nThe second strategy is to practice a kind of meditation. I don't like the word meditation, because it has a lot of connotations attached to it. Instead, think of it just as taking control over your thoughts. Our minds can often be bedlam. Intrusive thoughts randomly pop in and out. A weird, dark urge beckons you in front of an oncoming train, or off the ledge of a balcony. Cringeworthy moments in our past suddenly pop into our minds for no reason. Temptation, obsession and addiction smolder and burn.  \n\nBut you can get ahold of your mind, and tamp down the strange, impulsive and multitudinous voices that populate it (including the ones that keep you ruminating on this enemy). Practice thinking about nothing. Practice thinking about the thoughts that pop into your head. Practice by letting go.  \n\nYou'll be bad at it at first. But keep practicing. Keep letting go. Eventually, one day, you will be able to take the transgression, pick it up with your fingers, along with the pain that it has caused you, and you can look at it and decide whether to keep it, or whether to toss it aside.

I had this idea in my head that forgiveness meant absolving them of their shitty behavior or hurtful actions, pretending it never happened, that people who deserved forgiveness were people who apologized or at the very least felt some remorse, and that as long as I held on to my anger or resentment, they weren't \"off the hook\" for what they'd done.\n\nSo, instead of viewing forgiveness as symbolically saying \"It's okay that you did this to me and never acknowledged your wrongdoing or apologized for hurting me.\", I had to consciously re-learn what it meant and say, instead, \"You fucked up, your actions, intentionally or not, hurt me, I've felt my feelings about it and maybe your behavior still affects me, but I'm not going to let anger and resentment eat away at me as well.

Then, you wake up from that dream just as angry as while you were asleep. \n\n\nLook back and analyze the bad guy character. First, that character is just a manifestation of your mind in your sleeping dream, and/or the dream of reality. That Character is volunteering to do something shitty and evil in *your* dream, in *your* mind, in order for you to feel and experience emotions. Anger, or fear and bravery when confronting your enemy, or satisfaction (or possibly the lack of) when being victorious over your enemy are all *feelings*. For some reason, this is what reality is attracted to creating, an illusion to manifest emotions, vice versa. \n\n\nWe are all reflections of ourselves. The enemy rival is specifically tailored into your reality to invoke an emotion, in order to get a response, to create a story in our lives.  Good and bad are perceptions that are subjective. Your 'bad guy' reflection is a reflection of your personal beliefs, hence why the arch enemy is so good at drawing out emotional responses in you. \n\n\nWhat needs to be reminded to ones self is it is just a dream no matter how real it is.

The Bad Guy in your dreams is either you, or it is not. If it is you, then you are creating your own story obviously. If it is not, then it is an external *entity, who has willingly chosen to be a bad guy in your movie for you to play in so you can feel like the good guy.* Which means, that bad guy who does such an amazing job at pissing you off should receive an Emmy award for best actor for playing the role as the evil doer in your movie. \n\nLife is as magical as it is scientific, it will play both cards to shape your reality to extract the most emotional response, good or bad, it is perception. \n\nHow to remove the 'bad guy'\nIf the bad guy is a reflection of you, you must learn something from them, or about yourself. That bad guy is a concept, if you remove it from you reality, for example, by moving to another city. Another 'bad person' will appear in your new environment, until you have solved or accepted whatever lesson is to be learnt from that experience. \n\nIf you ask the bad guy \"are you real?\", it will likely use whatever beliefs you have to say yes. It may respond with intimidation techniques to distract your thought process of 'is it even real?' to 'uh oh, fight or flight!'. If it were to tell you \"no, I am not real, just a figment of your imagination\", your story would stop being believable. It is like you as Luke asking Vader, \"are we in a movie?\". It would destroy the movie, like it would with a viewers reality. \n\nPeople are saying it is not your fault, *it is your fault*, everything is. As a spirit having a human experience, you are responsible for everything in your movie. With that perspective comes power and responsibility, One has the capacity to change things in ones own reality.

They are just better at other things, and everyone has their own set of talents that contribute differently to the world.\n* People aren't malicious. They just do not understand the impact of their actions. Perhaps someone should help them understand.\n* People aren't evil. They are doing what they have chosen is right. Perhaps they are misguided.\n\n\nThe wreckless driver who just cut you off might actually have a legitimate reason to do so - maybe he's heading to the hospital. The person acting snarky at work might have experienced a recent death in the family. The intolerably annoying person who won't stop yammering is compensating for low self-esteem.

Let's say you were raised in a world where you didn't ever get hungry. You might miss your regular dinner time by a few hours but never by a few days. You were surrounded by semi-decent people who all shared the same religion and outlook on life. That is: if you follow the words in this holy book you are going to the good place, and if you don't you are not.\n\nNow you've strayed from the book. But let's be honest some of that stuff clearly doesn't apply to life at this day and age. Food restrictions were clearly pre-refrigeration or germ theory. You asked once why the big powerful guy from the book would not have told his loyal followers about germs and what not, but you were punished for speaking up when you should listen.\n\nAnyway, some of it clearly doesn't apply to you. You're bound for the good place.\n\nBut those people over there. They are breaking the rules on pages 123, 456, and 789. Clearly they are going to the bad place.\n\nSome part of the book says something about loving everyone and not judging but that was before we has so many people living in this city/rural area/country/state/county/village Besides they have way too many kids. In a few years your racial or religious group will be displaced by theirs. They will get to write laws and set up rules and brainwash your grand kids into the lies they read from their holy books.\n\n* Over years of this, and hearing the same from your friends, neighbors, family, and the news sources you choose to listen to. (disregarding, unfriending, or turning the channel off on anything you don't want to listen to.) You are arrogant enough to think your life is somehow worth more than theirs. That their rights should be worth less than yours. Perhaps even that their lives are worth less.\n\n* The motivation for many people is the arrogance that comes with religion. They can stand on their soap box 100% correct and knowing that means you are 100% wrong. Where as people with open minds are never 100% there is always that doubt so they are more likely to examine their actions or thoughts and change them when they see they are incorrect.\n\nIn the Us we have a \"war on Christians\" as told by the Christians. They have the most popular religion (by numbers) Every single president has been part of their sect. We have senators and congressmen that can run for office and win while being openly gay or lesbian, But they only come out as atheist after they've retired.\n\n* To some people the ENDS absolutely justify the MEANS. That man stem from \"love\" in that they see no problem torturing etc if it can help you get to a eternal heaven. I mean what is a few measly decades compared to eternity.\n\n* But most; regardless of what they say. Have this idea of vengeance being okay. That punishment for a crime is more important than rehabilitation. That if you did something wrong you should suffer for it. And their holy books have lots of bits about what is wrong. (never mind that they pick and choose on their own what applies to them.)\n\n**They are more human than the rest of us.** They embrace the baser instinct of the person with the biggest stick wins. Conform or die.\n\nSo maybe we don't try to find a way to say it is okay and instead say; grow up and figure out a way to join society. We don't live in clumps of 400 people anymore.

", "id": "d9nvr56"}, {"comment": "They can, it'd just require a lot of engineering to make it happen (which CFCs were a remarkable feat of themselves, even if it turned out to have unforseen negative consequences).  CFCs have several properties that allow them to work well in aerosol applications: first, they can quite readily be compressed, which is also why they're used in air conditioners and refrigeration, which take advantage of the relationship between a gas' temperature and its volume.  They also make good solvents, and are otherwise not very reactive on the scale of day-to-day life, so they're a good choice for packing into a can to use as a propellant.\n\nThere are definitely other gases that could be used as a propellant, but they have their own disadvantages.  For example, you could use an inert gas like CO2 or N2 (no, using the CO2 won't contribute to the greenhouse effect; it's usually harvested from the atmosphere or taken from organic sources, and therefore already in the carbon cycle anyway), but these gases don't compress to a liquid, which makes it difficult to pack them in with liquids since the gas will just float to the top.  You could use a separate CO2 canister for the aerosol effect (and, in fact, there are a lot of aerosol devices that do this), but this requires either building a CO2 canister into your packaging, which is expensive and difficult, or require your end user to supply the canister, which kinda kills a lot of the convenience that aerosols are designed to provide.  There are other gases that compress to a liquid at reasonable temperatures, but they have their own downsides.  For example, propane compresses to a liquid at reasonable temperatures, but it's also really dangerous.  I don't know much about other examples of propellants like this, but I imagine they each have their downsides - maybe they're toxic, or also damage the environment, or will react with many of the materials you're trying to propel.\n\nBut here's the thing.  Many of the applications that we use aerosol propellants for aren't really necessary.  There are other ways to propel the liquid that can work quite well.  At The Home Depot we sell spray bottles that can spray most fluids quite reliably and with little strain on your hand.  The only times that you really need something with a propellant in it is if you need the spray to be continuous and constant, like in spray paint.  Certainly not in shower gel.\n\nSo, instead of spending money on CFC-using aerosols, choose a product that doesn't use them - and maybe put the money you save toward schools and universities researching and engineering alternative propellants.
