Then, someone else made another lecture vid debunking it. Both of these speakers are doctors, Ph.Ds and very smart people dedicated to their fields. Both of their talks will probably sway the lay person first to one side then the other.\n\nIf they don't agree, if they don't know, how are random kids on a default sub on reddit going to know?

"], [2, "An important factor to bear in mind is that it isn't only your body which reacts to what you eat. We all rely heavily on a diverse fauna of bacteria resident in our guts, which break down nutrition-bearing mass as it wends its way through our intestines. Some species of bacteria are very picky, and will only flourish if you eat certain foods, so your choice of food can also be your choice of gut bacteria.\n\nThese bacteria are living organisms which both eat and excrete as part of their normal lives. Some species excrete substances which are beneficial to us, including vitamins; other byproducts can be harmful to us. There have even been documented cases of people who got drunk, even without touching a drop of alcohol: because their gut bacteria fermented sugars and in effect turned the digestive system into a brewery.\n\nArtificially compounded foodstuffs can offer some strains of bacteria an unexpected way to thrive, out-competing more beneficial bacteria; worse, gut bacteria might process a new part of their diet (represented by ingredients you can't even pronounce)  in a way which makes their residue therefrom particularly unhealthy to the host organism - i.e., you. \n\nThere are areas where there is no consensus, but the existence of controversy along specific lines of disagreement, should not be taken as a pretext to repudiate all nutritional wisdom from all sources.\n\nWe know, for example, that high salt content is closely linked to high blood pressure; smoked foods can taste great, but that same smoke typically is loaded with highly carcinogenic compounds. If you have some smoked brisket once in a blue moon, your body should probably handle it; if you have smoked foods at every meal: you're multiplying your chances of contracting the Big C.

I'm also 6'1 and about 195 lbs with a pretty low BF%. I only say this because eating 4500 when you don't require it is a very bad idea unless you really want to be fat. \n\nAnyways, even without a stimulant killing your appetite 4500 is still a lot of damn food. I've noticed that I need to build up to that amount of food if I'm coming out of a cut. I'll add say 100-200 calories extra every day until I'm back up at my bulking numbers (in this case 4500). Going from a deficit (usually 500 less than maintenance) to bulking (usually 500 more than maintenance) is a pretty big jump to take all in one day. I'm sure people do it so YMMV.\n\nIf it's possible try to schedule your doses between meals. For instance I'll have my breakfast before taking my first dose and I'll try to have lunch before my second dose. Assuming you enjoy sleeping then you probably don't have much in your system around dinner. The appetite surpression might still be there but at least it won't be as intense as an hour after your dose kicks in.\n\nThis is what works for me personally so again YMMV but I prefer to have big meals as opposed to smaller, more frequent meals. I used to have a highly caloric shake for breakfast before I started Adderall. I noticed that my appetite during lunch is the worst so I decided to have that shake at lunch time. Reason being is that the shake takes much less time to prepare than my other meals so I'm more inclined to suck it up and consume. Now my breakfast and dinner require more prep but since I haven't had my meds for breakfast yet and they're wearing down for dinner I'm more likely to eat.\n\nIn case you need a nice caloric shake recipe here's what I do.\n\n1 cup of oats (quick oats work well)\n2 cups of milk\n~100 grams of chunky peanut butter (creamy works just fine if you're a heathen)\n1 large banana\n2 scoops of chocolate whey\n\nI blend it all up real quick using a Nutribullet. This shake has around 1450 calories depending on how much PB you use.\n\nNow assuming you have ADHD then you'll probably know that we require consistency. Deviating from a set schedule can cause chaos so I generally try to eat the same breakfast and lunch each day. Dinner varies because my wife and kids aren't into eating the same thing every day.\n\nRunning! Most people will tell you to limit your cardio if you're bulking which has merit since you're sorta wasting calories. I find that I need to run in order to actually be hungry. I only run for about 12 minutes a day but the difference between 12 mins and 0 mins has a huge effect on my appetite. \n\nOne last thing. I find that while my appetite is for sure limited it's just in my head. Even though I'm not hungry I find that I'm still able to force myself to eat without getting sick or anything. My body wants the food but the extra dopamine is telling my brain that I'm not actually hungry. Once you break through that mental barrier and JUST DO IT then eating at a bulk will be easier.

I know if I really, REALLY maintained my diet and did things like an abundance of cardio or super sets, I could probably lose a few pounds. However, I feel it might be almost unrealistic to assume I will ever look like I did then.\n\nIt is not unrealistic whatsoever.\n\nCalories in vs calories out. For weight loss, that is all that matters. Eat lots of protein while doing this (1 to 1.25 grams per lbs of bodyweight) and lift heavy / infrequently (3x5 workouts on compound lifts) and you'll preserve the most muscle mass while on this cut.\n\nNot only can you look like you did in high school, but you can go further if you want. You can get to 12% bodyfat if you'd like (around when people see a visible though not super defined six pack) or hell continue to 10% body fat (far more defined six pack with no abdominal flexion).\n\nThere is nothing that prevents this within the realms of physics or biology. The only question, literally the only question, is how much do you want it?\n\nIf you really want it, sit down and start a calorie journal.

That is, review it. Point out its flaws in addition to its strengths. Recommend what sort of person and goals would be best suited for it. You should also give it a score so people can do apples to apples comparisons with other workouts you review. Once you have a decent quantity of videos I would also create a list or summary of all your ratings. Of course, scoring workouts could be problematic since what's a 10/10 for one person's goals and fitness level might be a bad without for another. To address this you might want to consider multiple scores taking into account a few different common gym goers.

If you lose 5lbs, you reduce your weight by 2%. While it's still something to be proud of, you might not be able to notice it visually.\n\nIf your goal is to lose weight, focus on that. Counting calories can be difficult, but you get better with practice. If you're not happy with your current rate of weight loss, cut more. Most people shoot for 1500-1800kCal/day, and the consensus here seems to be that going lower than 1200-1000 is when serious negative effects start to show up.\n\nMy recommendation is that you track your weight daily, and write it down. Every week, take an average. If you don't notice your weight decreasing week by week, try cutting another 100 calories a day. Second, if you want to lift, pick a beginner routine from the wiki (Most people seem to like \"Starting Strength\").

First walking, 1-2-4-8 miles until I felt like it's no longer a challenge, so then I started to incorporate jogging. And the key was to do it everyday and if not possible then every other day.

I never really saw both of them as mutually exclusive COMPLETELY. There is some overlap. I'm not as good as the guy I'm quoting below but this is kind of my mentality. I want to build up a good foundation at least. I've kind of brainwashed myself thanks to friends and online forums and kind of underrate my own progress as well which probably doesn't help. For example when people see me at the gym squatting 2 plates atg (most are non-lifters / newbs, it's a university gym) they often tell me that's impressive and ask how long I've been lifting for etc. etc. etc.). I always say something like it's barely a rookie level squat and nothing to be proud of and in their minds I'm probably a self-deprecating asshole because they're quarter squatting 155 or whatever. However, I'm actually being 100% honest with my opinion and not trying to be a dick. So yea aside from the psychological aspect of it and the fact that I've never seen someone with a nice chest only able to bench a plate, I think both can go hand in hand at times. Basically what Layne Norton says here:\n\n> I\u2019m sure you are thinking \u201cI am a bodybuilder; I don\u2019t care how much I lift!\u201d But by increasing your strength you will increase the amount of weight you will be able to lift when you train with a higher rep, \u2018bodybuilding style\u2019 training which will increase your potential for growth. For example, if one trained only straight high reps (15-20 reps) on an exercise you may end up plateauing at a squat of 300 lbs for 15 reps (not necessarily, just an example). If that same individual incorporated heavy training into their regiment however, perhaps they get strong enough that they can squat 400 lbs for 15 reps. Who do you think will have the greatest potential to increase their mass over the long haul? Most likely it will be the person using more weight if all other variables are equal because they will be able to create more overload and greater muscle damage, evoking a greater growth response. So while pure bodybuilding style training may give you more growth over the short term, a combination of heavy weights for low reps and light weight for high reps over the long term is going to provide more muscle by increasing your growth potential!\n\n> So while pure bodybuilding style training may give you more growth over the short term, a combination of power and hypertrophy training over the long term is going to provide more muscle by increasing your growth potential!

At the end of the movement, you need to thrust your hips forward and lock your glutes and hamstrings. If those muscles start burning halfway through your sets, you're doing it right.

One reason is it takes time. ~20 second pinching for every single stretch you do? You'll start loathing stretching in the long run then. Why are you stretching in the first place? At start it will be range of motions but later on once you achieved some of them - it's going to be maintenance and learning to enjoy stretching. Then you move on to new positions.

Working on your ankle mobility is gonna allow you to get low alot easier.\n How do you work on your ankle mobility? The best I can tell you in this short reply is stretch out your calves, look online for the best calf stretches. Then do a squat with no weights, you can do this when you are at home watching tv by the way, lean on one side and try to force the ankle as far forward and towards the tight areas as much as possible. Explore it, take about 5 minutes each side at home. You'll figure it out quickly. \n\nAlso, roll out your feet with a lacrosse ball. It's going to increase your CNS's awareness of your feet, essentially giving your brain the feeling of having more control over your squatting movements. It's automatically going to give you more mobility. \n\njust as importantly, do the spine warmup that I posted in the post. It'll make your squat feel alot easier as well.

I had this problem until I got the Arm-aid, which has helped tremendously with forearm. You'll be able to tell if you have tight forearms if you have trouble putting your wrists in extension like you would for a handstand. \n* Then there's the biceps/triceps/delts.\n* Then there's the pec minors/pec majors/lattisimus dorsi/teres major. \n* then there's thoracic spine\n\nYou kind of have to stretch/do body maintenance on them all to really diagnose whats the issue is. Likely it's a combination of many things. Kit laughin's shoulder mobility series will help you.

The power is really coming from torque generated from the ball and socket joints--the hips and shoulders. During the swing all the back and core muscles are also powered on but their job is to maintain the S shaped curve of the spine...at any level of the vertebra there should not be too much twisting or bending of one single vertebrae over the other.

I find that front squats tend to put a little more focus on the quads, forces you to brace your core a little more in the abs, and changes the balance to more in front of you. There's a lot more going on in general to focus on to stay safe during the lift. Not that there isn't focus on the quads with a back squat, but to me the back squat feels more well rounded and engages the hamstrings and glutes if you have good depth. When I do fronts I don't feel as much in the other muscles, just typically quads and core. I think changing up every now and then could be good for you to build some strength all around your legs, and would be easier to balance naturally. You'll probably even find that you can do more weight once you have your form down. Another alternative would be the leg press machine. Again this being helpful that you would be able to focus on pushing the weight and flexing the quads, without focusing on balance or bracing the core. Don't pop a full lock out on the leg press machine. Straighten your leg and flex the quads, but I would advise against a full lock out to avoid possible injury. If you've had a knee injury I suggest you avoid leg extension machines.

Other than that, everything else is individual and you should do the reps as efficiently as possible.\n\nIf you're interested I'll link the best squat guide on the internet: read it through and see if you can alter anything specific. Other than that just keep on doing what you're doing - and don't take all the advice here as facts, most people just give cookie-cutter \"lean forward\"/\"use your hip-drahve\" advice. \n\nHere's the link: http://strengtheory.com/how-to-squat/\n\nFeel free to ask if you want any recommendations.

The Bulletproof guy recommends using it as a health food in low doses (like 7g of protein doses) and *not* as a bodybuilding protein.  He likes it for the cysteine as a natural alternative to something like NAC and for gut-health.\n\nFor an isolate, Jay Robb's is alright.

If you're trying to be a competitive athlete / bodybuilder and you need to stay super lean and super muscular and make those increasing gains and quick recoveries, then that might make sense.\n\nIf you're just trying to stay lean, strong, and healthy, you could probably use less without any real noticable differences.  I do around 90-150g/d at ~5'10 150lb.  At 150g/d, I feel like I'm eating a ton of protein.  At around 60-80g it starts to feel like I might be losing some lean mass or trading lean mass for fat.  I could probably scoot by right at ~85g/d and do just fine.\n\nHere's a recent study that might make you feel better:\nhttps://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnme/2016/9104792/\n\n*\"In male subjects with several years of experience with resistance training, chronic consumption of a diet high in protein had* ***no harmful effects on any measures of health.\"***\n\nI would dial it in by this guy's recommendations.

Resistance exercise doesn\u2019t require as much protein: Experienced bodybuilders are typically in nitrogen balance at 1.2 g/kg/day (1.088 grams per 2lbs of body weight).\"*\n\n*\"At a protein intake of 230 g/day (920 calories), the body\u2019s ability to convert ammonia to urea is saturated. [3] This means the nitrogen from every additional gram of protein lingers in the body as ammonia, a toxin.  Clearly marginal dietary protein is toxic, via ammonia poisoning, at this intake level. A reasonable estimate for where toxicity begins is between 150 to 200 g/day.  Let\u2019s say our athlete is an 80 kg man. Then maximum muscle gain will be achieved at a protein intake of 1.875 x 80 = 150 g/day. Toxicity will begin somewhere between 150 to 200 g/day. So the \u201cplateau region\u201d where all the benefits, and none of the toxicity, are achieved is between 150 g/day and some protein intake not much above 150 g/day.\"*\n\n* http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2011/01/protein-satiety-and-body-composition/\n\n*\"The main effect of changing the protein content of the diet is a modest change in body composition.*  ***High-protein diets make you leaner and a little lighter.

Eat no less than 60 and no more than 100 grams of carbohydrate per day.  If you want to lose or gain weight, vary your caloric intake -- and that variation should be mostly in carbohydrates.  Earlier in my career, I believed that a bodybuilder needed to eat as much as 200 grams of protein a day in order to develop the maximum mucle mass.  Since then, my research has shown me that bodybuilders do need more protein than the average person, but probably no more than around 100 grams and certainly no more than 150.  This gives enough protein for muscle-building without adding any unnecessary calories to the diet.  Non-bodybuilders on the other hand, can easily get by on no more than 1 gram of protein for every kilo (2.2lbs) of body weight.\"*\n\nMy general approach is to eat a modest amount of protein via a clean omnivorous diet with intermittent fasting (a good portion of which from seafood/shellfish, pastured birds & eggs, grass-fed meats, WAPF prepared nuts / legumes, a ton of vegetables, and some protein powder), occasionally having a few vegan days through the week with lower meatless protein intakes.

A carb is a carb in terms of hitting macros and calories, however, the body responds differently to them\n\nSugar (glucose/fructose) can only be processed in the liver and excessive amounts of sugar is obviously detrimental to your body. Your blood sugar spikes, you release insulin to stabilize your blood sugar, flood your body with a lot of sugar over a long period of time you develop insulin resistance, precursor of diseases such as diabetes, etc.Too much sugar and your body converts it into adipose tissue. Multiple studies throughout the years have shown that excessive amounts of sugar is also responsible for cardiovascular disease and cancer. Sugar from whole foods generally isn't something to worry about, just watch out for added sugar in processed foods. Also, I am not trying to say that sugar or the insulin response is bad. Glucose is our primary source of energy, we need it, especially athletes (unless you in ketosis). And the insulin response is necessary for muscle growth. \n\nFructose tends to get a bad rep because, like glucose, it can only be processed in the liver and excessive amounts of fructose also contributes to insulin resistance and fatty liver (high fructose corn syrup gets the most heat). Does that mean you should stop eating fruit? Hell no. In fact, whole fruits are great for you, it has a lot of fiber, another type of carbohydrate, and it is loaded with other lovely micronutrients. Fiber is extremely important; it's found in plant-based foods including fruit, veggies, and other complex carbohydrates like potatoes, legumes, and oats. Not only do we need fiber to maintain digestive health, but it also slows the absorption of sugar and helps control blood sugar levels. Also, fiber is very satiating, whereas simple sugars/refined carbohydrates low in fiber won't fill you up as easily and may trigger hunger (high amounts of sugar can be very addictive as well).\n\nIdeally, most of the carbs you get should be from unrefined, plant-based, complex sources found in nature.

If there is anything you are lacking in then buy the supplement. I will say that supplements aren't necessary because most of the nutrients that your body needs can be found in whole foods, and it's better to get the nutrients from the actual food than from a pill. If you do your best to eat a balanced whole foods diet then nutrient deficiency is generally never an issue.

Just go on the Internet and lie?\n\nThere are three total mentions of overtraining in Starting Strength:\n\n1. The deadlift is brutally hard and can therefore complicate training if improperly used. It is very easy to do wrong, and a wrong deadlift is a potentially dangerous thing. There will be a few trainees who simply cannot perform this movement safely with heavy weights, due to a previous injury or an inability to perform the movement correctly. The deadlift is also easy to **overtrain**; a heavy workout takes a long time to recover from, and you must keep this fact in mind when setting up your training schedule.\n\n2.  Advanced athletes are working at levels close enough to their genetic potential that great care should be taken to ensure enough variability in the intensity and volume that **overtraining** does not become a problem.\n\n3.  The number of work sets to be done after the warm-ups will vary with the exercise and the individual. The squat benefits from sets across (three sets for novice trainees), as does the bench press and the press. The deadlift is hard enough, and is usually done after a lot of squatting, and one heavy set is usually sufficient, with more tending to **overtrain** most people.\n\nHe also describes at length why he chose 3-sets across and 5 reps per set for bench, squat, and press, with additional sets for power cleans, but you already read it so I won't paste all that.\n\n[And he addressed Jamie's criticism specifically on this very website](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/n13d8/i_am_mark_rippetoe_author_of_starting_strength/c35g58e/)\n\nSo get out of here with the \"I looked at both sides and came to an honest conclusion\" bullshit and just say you prefer the anti-SS circlejerk because you're sick of hearing about it.", "id": "daofavr"}, {"comment": "What im unsure about is how long do are people usually able to keep increasing by 5 or 10 lbs?

The thing it took me a while to realize was how much better my lungs felt post run once I started using some sort of humidity entrapment.

There is some concern that by \u201ctreating\u201d these conditions, we may \u201cimpair the adaptive response to exercise\u201d (Schoenfeld, 2012).\n\nSchoenfeld does not find evidence that NSAIDs will blunt muscular gains. He even mentions a study showing increased muscle mass following NSAID ingestion and resistance training. Yet, satellite cell activity may be reduced by using non-selective COX inhibitors such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen. Schoenfeld (2012) notes that there may be individual variability in the ability to increase muscle mass when given NSAIDs:\n\n> \u201cit may be that any negative effects of NSAID administration on muscle growth may be specific to those with an increased potential to add lean mass and have a minimal impact on the rest of the population\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to MPS, Schoenfeld identified some studies on human subjects. The studies had different methodologies and measured different types of MPS (endurance-related MPS versus hypertrophy-related MPS) and were thus not directly comparable. Some studies said MPS was blunted by NSAIDS, while other studies contradicted this.\n\n**Schoenfeld concludes that short-term use of NSAIDs will probably not be an issue, while long-term NSAID usage might be harmful to adaptations.**\n\nFollowing Schoenfeld\u2019s review of 2012, new studies have been published.\n\nIn 2015, Duff et al. found that:\n\n> \u201cIngestion of low-dose ibuprofen (i.e., 400 mg) in the post- absorptive state following resistance exercise does not lead to greater gains in muscle mass or strength compared to placebo in postmenopausal women. These results are in contrast to previous research showing that 1,200 mg/day of ibuprofen was effective for increasing muscle mass and strength in older men and women\u201d\n\nOne year later, Duff et al. (2016) got the same results in postmenopausal women:\n\n> \u201cContrary to our hypothesis, augmenting resistance training with ibuprofen did not have an additive effect on bone properties or muscle mass\u201d\n\nNote that the study populations were narrow, hence not representative of the population at large.\n\nThe focus of the research hypothesis here seems to have shifted from \u201care NSAIDs harmful to adaptations?\u201d to \u201cwill NSAIDs improve adaptations?\u201d.\n\nA recent study by Vella et al. (2016) demonstrated no change in inflammatory markers or DOMS following Ibuprofen ingestion. The subjects were untrained males and consumed three 400mg doses of Ibuprofen throughout the trial day. This study didn\u2019t evaluate or measure MPS, but is still relevant enough to mention.

Generally a healthy person can take ibuprofen occasionally with no problem. It becomes more of an issue with individuals with complicated medical histories, chronic users like arthritis patients,or the elderly. Ibuprofen falls into a class of drugs called NSAIDs, which stands for non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. NSAIDs work by inhibiting an enzyme called cyclooxygenase 1, also known as COX-1. This enzyme activates the inflammation pathway. However this enzyme also functions to protect our stomach lining from that nasty acid digesting our food. The three main ways our stomach protects itself are through an acid neutralizing base called bicarbonate, secretion of protective mucous, and blood flow which allows damaged cells to be replaced or repaired.

I watched a few videos on them previously but it's obvious I need to watch more. \n\nAnd about \"if you can do a front squat, you can catch a clean\". My wrist mobility is atrocious (as is shoulder/upper back to a lesser extent) and that causes me to not be able to perform a front squat without doing the cross armed variant. Do you know any mobility exercises to help with this? I plan on working front squats back into my normal routine and really focusing on trying to do it with the proper grip, but I'm aware it'll take some time to get there. \n\nAnd yeah, balance was an issue in the first lift.

Butyrate is produced by bacteria in our gut that ferment the fiber in fruits and vegetables. \n\nIf your epithelial cells do not receive butyrate, then the mucus lining our gut degrades and weakens. Bacteria then start coming in contact with the cells and this triggers an immune response by the body and causes inflammation and when the immune cells come to attack the bacteria a few things happen.\n\nOxidative DNA damage to surrounding cells.

I've been researching a lot about the gut microbiome and how it impacts overall health. \n\nThe diet we eat will impact the diversity of our gut flora. Here's how it works, our digestive tract is lined with mucus. This mucus is produced by the epithelial cells (cells lining the digestive tract behind the mucus). The purpose of mucus is to prevent any exogenous agents from coming in contact with our cells and going into our blood stream. \n\nOur epithelial cells stay healthy by consuming a short chain fatty acid called butyrate. Butyrate is produced by bacteria in our gut that ferment the fiber in fruits and vegetables. \n\nIf your epithelial cells do not receive butyrate, then the mucus lining our gut degrades and weakens. Bacteria then start coming in contact with the cells and this triggers an immune response by the body and causes inflammation and when the immune cells come to attack the bacteria a few things happen.\n\nOxidative DNA damage to surrounding cells. This leads to cancerous cells.\n\nEndotoxin is released by these bacteria upon death because it is a component of their cell walls. This gets into your blood stream and leads to even more inflammation.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOZcbNw7sng\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI3KtR3LoqM\n\nIf you're into reading research articles, this is a really good [research review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4121395/)\n\nI can go more in depth if you want, but how researchers know these things is they measure the mucus and level of cytokines (released by immune cells) in your stool.\n\ntl;dr: Eat your fruits and vegetables", "id": "daqmczc"}], [{"comment": "Have known several gut microbiome PhD students.

Calories in, calories out. However it doesnt end there as much as reddit wants you to believe. The reality is that your body is ever adjusting metabolically, hormonally, ect. If all youre worried about is calories then do what you please, but youre on a fitness board and I'm assuming you want to be efficient as possible for health benefits and thats where this calories in vs calories thing falls apart.\n\nResearch shows greater weight loss in those who eat breakfast to start. Many reasons for this, my favorite explanation is cortisol. its highest in the mornings (or after a fast) and leads to greater fat utilization as it diminishes carb use. Reddit will tell you this is why fasted exercise is so great, but ask Reddit to explain it and they cant, and they are often very unaware of the rest of the story unfortunately. This is why echo chambers can be bad. Cortisol inhibits carb use, and increases fat use, but the effects are insignificant. in a 30 min-1 hour run i think the benefit was something like 68 extra kcals. Thats nothing. However on the other hand fasted running means you dont address cortisol, you then do exercise, which increases cortisol, you inhibit carb utilization which is needed for precursors to beta oxidation, and cause (over time I should mention as all nutrition should be viewed over time not day to day) protein breakdown for ketone use. Excessive Ketones lower blood PH, which leads to the body needing to release a bicarbonate to counter it which then means you have less for actual exercise leading to a less efficient workout, in which youll lose out on the ability to perform and miss out on an opportunity to burn more calories... This happens because without the bicarb u have excessive hydrogen ions building up in the muscles, with no way of shuttling them out, which leads to lowered tissue PH which interferes with performance by decreasing glycolytic enzymes, decreasing ATP pslitting, increasing pain receptor sensitivity in muscles, and decreasing the ability to release and re-absorb ca for contractions... \n\nAnd thats just breakfast. \n\nIf you care about performance you want to address fluctuations throughout the day. muscle protein synthesis tends to reverse after 4 hours of being activated, and the best way we know how to reverse it is with BCAAs and protein which will reverse it for the next 4 hours. So if youre not ingesting protein for hours on end, you could POTENTIALLY be hindering maximum growth.\n\nFat ingestion affects workouts, carbohydrate ingestion along with protein affects recovery and performance whether it be before or after exercise, casein at night has been shown to reduce morning cortisol levels... \n\nwhich brings us all the way back to the beginning.\n\ntl;dr, calories in and calories out is only technically true for weight issues, but its not smart and its only something regurgitated by those with no understanding of metabolic processes.

If a large egg weighs 65g, a slice of bread 40 and a medium avocado 150g, that's 425g, and 650 calories as a starter.\n\nFor mains we have 300g of cumin and coriander/cilantro rice which is around 350cals, a 200g chicken breast with some tasty seasoning shit so it's not boring at 220, lets get a couple tbsp of olive oil in there for good measure at 40, let's just add 100 cals for 100g of roasted veg. \n\nSo now we're at 1025g of food and approx 1170 clean calories. \n\nWe'll throw in a shake with 250ml of full fat milk, 162cals, and a 30g scoop of whey 111cals. So 280g and 273cals. \nFor dessert today it's a delicious bar of chocolate because fuck It.

The whole \"how does calories consumed compare to calories used\" issue is really \"at the margins\" and I feel like as you've mentioned it conflates a relatively simple issue. The articles suggests ~10% for certain foods, so depending on what % of the diet they make up, it's likely even less than that.\n\nThe bottom line is that when calorie counting the assumption is 100% utilization, so 1500 calories of skittles and 1500 calories of coal are the same. If people trying to lose adhere to the calories in< calories out, they're going to be okay. Now if someone wants to eat 10,000 \"calories\" worth of indigestible material like wood or coal or something, and just shit out sawdust and coal and lose weight, then yeah they're \"hacking\" CICO, but at the root of this is that you can't MAKE calories out of nothing. The calories on a candy wrapper are the most you can get from that, not a factor of digestibility.\n\nGo by what's on the label versus TDEE and you guarantee results.

Perhaps there are other factors they can look at that will give them a further nudge in the right direction. Personally I find that I cut quicker and more effectively when I maximise the fibre in my diet. Whether that's because of any extra effects like Insulin management, or whether the margins of error for my CICO calculation are smaller due to the better calorie/weight ratio of higher fibre foods, or whether I'm sticking to the macros more consistently because I feel fuller, I'm not sure because I've never really looked any further into it. I found the result by trial and error. Sitting at the same calories and playing with macro/micro nutrient breakdowns, or playing with meal splits, playing with variety of foods. It's all been tried and people have had success with the broad range. CICO is still a great starting point. \n\nAgain, similar for online BMR calculators, sure, try them and set your initial goals by them, but if you are gaining/losing weight differently than the generic, limited, online calculator says you should, modify your damn diet.

Calories in, calories out. However it doesnt end there as much as reddit wants you to believe. The reality is that your body is ever adjusting metabolically, hormonally, ect. If all youre worried about is calories then do what you please, but youre on a fitness board and I'm assuming you want to be efficient as possible for health benefits and thats where this calories in vs calories thing falls apart.\n\nResearch shows greater weight loss in those who eat breakfast to start. Many reasons for this, my favorite explanation is cortisol. its highest in the mornings (or after a fast) and leads to greater fat utilization as it diminishes carb use. Reddit will tell you this is why fasted exercise is so great, but ask Reddit to explain it and they cant, and they are often very unaware of the rest of the story unfortunately. This is why echo chambers can be bad. Cortisol inhibits carb use, and increases fat use, but the effects are insignificant. in a 30 min-1 hour run i think the benefit was something like 68 extra kcals. Thats nothing. However on the other hand fasted running means you dont address cortisol, you then do exercise, which increases cortisol, you inhibit carb utilization which is needed for precursors to beta oxidation, and cause (over time I should mention as all nutrition should be viewed over time not day to day) protein breakdown for ketone use. Excessive Ketones lower blood PH, which leads to the body needing to release a bicarbonate to counter it which then means you have less for actual exercise leading to a less efficient workout, in which youll lose out on the ability to perform and miss out on an opportunity to burn more calories... This happens because without the bicarb u have excessive hydrogen ions building up in the muscles, with no way of shuttling them out, which leads to lowered tissue PH which interferes with performance by decreasing glycolytic enzymes, decreasing ATP pslitting, increasing pain receptor sensitivity in muscles, and decreasing the ability to release and re-absorb ca for contractions... \n\nAnd thats just breakfast. \n\nIf you care about performance you want to address fluctuations throughout the day. muscle protein synthesis tends to reverse after 4 hours of being activated, and the best way we know how to reverse it is with BCAAs and protein which will reverse it for the next 4 hours. So if youre not ingesting protein for hours on end, you could POTENTIALLY be hindering maximum growth.\n\nFat ingestion affects workouts, carbohydrate ingestion along with protein affects recovery and performance whether it be before or after exercise, casein at night has been shown to reduce morning cortisol levels... \n\nwhich brings us all the way back to the beginning.\n\ntl;dr, calories in and calories out is only technically true for weight issues, but its not smart and its only something regurgitated by those with no understanding of metabolic processes.

Your macro nutrients are pieces of the presents. Carbs, fats, proteins are the gift box, the wrapping, and the bow. \n\nThroughout the day you are theoretically supposed to create 2000 presents. However you only have so many workers and over time these workers, especially the box workers, will get frustrated if they dont have boxes to package things into. \n\nYou can do 2 things: 1. Portion the materials into the factory throughout the day so that the system is as efficient as possible and no one is overwhelmed while working at a nice pace throughout the day -or- 2. Drop all the packets in at once and have them sort through everything at once.\n\nthe second option means that its done all at once, and the box workers will become frustrated and stressed after they have nothing to do for so long. This stress means that they are not enthusiastic about work, and this stress accumulates and carries over to the next days. The next day when work starts the boxing workers dont work as hard because of their stress, which means the box wrappers need to pick up the slack, but since their job naturally requires the help of the boxers to completely do their job they cant keep up. So the Bow workers come in and they are supposed to only have the job of putting a bow on and making everything pretty. They CAN help, but theyre not good at it and so they rip up pieces of the bows they have in order to try and wrap the boxes that the wrappers are now trying to make. The end result is that they still made 2000 presents, but they are not as nice and in turn they lost a few bows as they had to dig into the storage room to make up for their ripping of the ones they had to work with.\n\nThats the best I can do, its a really hard thing to ELI5 imo because there are so many moving parts. Each worker would have limitations on things they can do, motivations and depressors, and then on top of it all the factory might chime in with a \"Hooooly shit boys we just got another order or 500 presents, make due with what we have!\".", "id": "damqrff"}, {"comment": "> ... greater fat utilization as it diminishes carb use.\n\nInteresting.

Then switch to a more hypertrophy centered routine if you want to build muscle more efficiently. "], [1, "> 5x5 is only for strength and not for aesthetics.\n\nWell, it's really a question of volume/intensity\n\nHypertrophy will be stimulated by more volume with lower intensity. Especially if the eccentric phase of the movement is slow. Look at German Volume training with 10x10 movements with 90 sek rest in between sets/supersets.\n\nStrength will typically be increased by working with high intensity (1-5 RM) with corresponding low volumes. Powerlifters will tend to work with sets of singles, doubles and triples. Hell maybe even occasionally sets of five.\n\nSo the question is, where do a classic 5x5 set and rep range fall in this spectrum. I'd actually say it falls somewhere in between. 5x5 is actually an OK volume. If you look at Starting Strength, then that's just 3x5. With SL you do 25 reps volume while with SS you only do 15. I'm not saying SL is optimal for hypertrophy, but it isn't to badly geared towards it either. The only real criticism is, that the upper body tend to need more volume down the road to continue progressing than the lower  body does.\n"], [1, "So...

And this can be easily addressed by simply performing some extra excercises, provided you choose them wisely.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the program suggests you can do chin ups and dips. And what I actually do is do these two excercises on squat/ohp/deadlift day. Dips for working your chest since it kinda gets neglected on this workout, and for your triceps. And chinups for your lats and biceps. On squat/bench/row day I just do bicep curls and lying triceps extensions like Rippetoe advices to do them. Just do 3 sets of each one of these excercises in the 6-10 rep range. Once you can do 3 sets of 10, add some weight and work yourself up to sets of 10 again.

Just take a while to do the bench, squat, press, DL, chins and dips all in one workout (would take me 2 hours plus).  \n\nI found that I could DL 3x5 every workout until the low 300s as well, but mileage may vary - lots of guys would get fried doing that.  I just did:\n\nBench 3x5\nSquat 3x5\nPress 3x5\nDL 3x5\nEvery workout.  Eventually I dropped DL to 2x5 and added chins afterwards.  Got my DL to high 300s that way.

Do push-ups and chinups every day, just don't do them close to failure. If you can do 12 chinups just do 6 a few times a day. Don't make it too complicated, find programs online to increase chinup and push-up numbers by doing chinups and push-ups and do that. Every workout alternate 2-3 sets of arm work. One workout curl 8-12 reps, the other a triceps workout like skull crushers or the tricep extension in this video https://youtu.be/-rh3MHnRI_I . Up weight when you can and you'll be great.

Especially if the eccentric phase of the movement is slow. Look at German Volume training with 10x10 movements with 90 sek rest in between sets/supersets.\n\nStrength will typically be increased by working with high intensity (1-5 RM) with corresponding low volumes. Powerlifters will tend to work with sets of singles, doubles and triples. Hell maybe even occasionally sets of five.\n\nSo the question is, where do a classic 5x5 set and rep range fall in this spectrum. I'd actually say it falls somewhere in between. 5x5 is actually an OK volume. If you look at Starting Strength, then that's just 3x5. With SL you do 25 reps volume while with SS you only do 15. I'm not saying SL is optimal for hypertrophy, but it isn't to badly geared towards it either. The only real criticism is, that the upper body tend to need more volume down the road to continue progressing than the lower  body does.\n", "id": "daoxko9"}], [{"comment": "So...

And this can be easily addressed by simply performing some extra excercises, provided you choose them wisely.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the program suggests you can do chin ups and dips. And what I actually do is do these two excercises on squat/ohp/deadlift day. Dips for working your chest since it kinda gets neglected on this workout, and for your triceps. And chinups for your lats and biceps. On squat/bench/row day I just do bicep curls and lying triceps extensions like Rippetoe advices to do them. Just do 3 sets of each one of these excercises in the 6-10 rep range. Once you can do 3 sets of 10, add some weight and work yourself up to sets of 10 again.

Plyometric style stuff (Defensive shuffle drill, shuttle runs, cone/line drills in general, ladders, jump training etc)\n3. Lower body strength (lifting, Posterior chain, quads, calves)\n\nThe first two might seem pretty obvious but i swear the strength training will have drastic impact long term.

Doing 3 sets of 10 reps on each side of cable wood choppers will make sure those muscles will be ready to go when you have to make a turn and twist your upper body while running in high speeds.

Doing 3 sets of 10 reps on each side of cable wood choppers will make sure those muscles will be ready to go when you have to make a turn and twist your upper body while running in high speeds. Doing high volume seemed to work better for me than just strength training when it comes to agility. If you wanna improve sprint speed and acceleration, then you might wanna do some strength training in addition to all of these things I mentioned. \n\nAlso from a more scientific approach, you will want to have a lower centre of gravity, which means more mass below your bellybutton than above it.

Obviously you will favor a side, but the more equal you can get them, the faster you will be.  A lot of things can happen if they aren't near equal.  Your weaker side could hold back the stronger and you won't reach full potential, or the weaker could attempt to keep up and you could get an injury.  Typically a pull or tear of a muscle.  \n\nNow all of my kids are different and have different goals.  But one thing is always constant, they want to be faster.\n\nSo, it has been proven that faster people typically apply more force to the ground per step while running than slower people do.  If I had the time or energy to find it, there is a great read out there about a coach who really focuses on trap-bar deadlifts.  He won a bet with Johnny Manziel accurately guessing his combine 40 time based solely on Manziel's trap bar max.  \n\nSo from that we take away that having more power per step is our desired goal.  But, not all leg exercises will translate into more power.  So I actually go very basic on my leg lifts, and couple them up with plyometrics and core work.\n\nBut a lot of people are going to think, ok, I got this.  and do 4x10 on squat at 50% of their max.  Well that won't cut it.  Leg work needs to be in high volume at high weight.  So you are going to do a lot of sets.  \n\nMy personal workout looks like this for my squats only:\nWarmup    \nRound 1 - 3 sets - 5 reps per set - 75% of my WORKING max\nRound 2 - 3 sets - 5 reps per set - 80% of my WORKING max\nRound 3 - 3 sets - 3 reps per set - 85% of my WORKING max\nRound 4 - 3 sets - 2 reps per set - 90% of my WORKING max\nRound 5 - 3 sets - 1 reps per set - 95% of my WORKING max\n\nSo 15 sets totaling 48 reps at a weight at or above 75% of my max.\n\nNow I would never attempt that as a novice.  Even starting at 1 set per round would be decent.  But superset that with squat jumps, box jumps, split jumps, speed box work, depth drops.  And then you are on your way.  Again if I wasn't so lazy today, there are quite a few studies proving that supersetting your plyos and leg exercises are the best way to yield results.  \n\nSo I would actually start a kid there and close out the workout with the sprinting and agility work.  Maybe 10 to 16 total rounds on an agility ladder at 100% effort. Then I think lateral movement is very important so we would do some slalom drills, box drills and just good old shuffling side to side at 100%.

Have you tried practicing shuttle runs? Like in PE class? You have 2 lines (can't remember the exact distance apart,but it's short. A sprint.) and the point is to run from one line to the other as fast as you can, pick up an object on the 2nd line, return it to the 1st line, and repeat it again with a 2nd object. The biggest tip for this exercise is landing and pivoting on the same foot.\n\nAs far as increasing sprint speed in general, there's always 30/60s and 60/90s. (Sprint as fast as you possibly can for 30 or 60 seconds, walk for 60 or 90 seconds. Repeat.)\n\nBut the stopping, turning, and going will probably be most improved by shuttle runs.

Its hard work but they arent fitness gods - they just trained harder alot sooner than we did - so we need to catchup.\n\nYou can catchup by::\n\n1. Normal skipping - (stick with this till its easy - get this right first)\nThis is your major killer - there is difference between efficiency and just doing it (youll find out)\n\n2. One foot skipping (muscle building)\n\n3. Run- skipping on the spot (advanced)\n\n4. Alternating foot skipping (enhance skipping)\n\nHidden secret: use a weighted skipping rope to get full body results.\n\nDo sets of 200 and aim for 2000 a day with breaks inbetween\n and in 3-6 months:\nYou can run 10kms easily (a boxer at my local gym knew the truth straight away before i told him)\n\n500 skips of day will burn fat like 20mins on the bike.\nThis all takes time but in the end:\nyou need to have the juice and power to move - you can focus on the activity drills later when you can keep up with beginner level basics but for now...you need the carido and power in the calf muscles and it takes time and alot of hard work. However, there is no better feeling than being cardio-fit by skipping.\n\nOtherwise (apart from the muscle soreness) youll run out of juice before agility running is effective to you to mean anything important to your fitness level.\n\nAnd yes...it takes 3-6 months - this gets  boring and repeative but fitness was always a long distance patience game in the end that gets you the top hard results.", "id": "daps1pp"}], [{"comment": "Here's a 6 week free program that is pretty good:http://www.theultimateathleteproject.com/sq/46446-6-week-ultimate-frisbee-conditioning", "id": "dapsa6i"}], [{"comment": "Electrical muscle stimulation might help by recruiting more muscle fibers.
