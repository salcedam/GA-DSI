The same happens to men when they've got psychological erectile dysfunction: they want to be good lovers, and by wanting that, they forget about being turned on and be willing to fuck. Because worries overweight arousal, erections don't happen to them, and the same happens with psychological vaginismus, that would be the sexual equivalent in women. Our bodies don't work rationally, but in function of impulses; we don't go to the bathroom when we want to, but when we feel like going there, and the same goes for sex.\n\nSo, if you want to fuck, you need to want to fuck, and not any other things. You need to be turned on by the idea, you need to want to have him inside you (again, not because of other things, but because it's *you* who wants to feel it and is turned on by feeling it), you need to want to feel even some pain, in the same way we may want to go trough some if we want to get a tatoo. It's our pleasure that matters, everything else are obstacles to overcome.\n\n*edit: That being said, there can totally be more complex ideas attached to that, making us unable to want to have sex without linking it with so many other ideas that will interfer.

"], [5, "The reason I can't have sexual relationships with all of my friends is because I am a monogamist who views sex as a primary component of a romantic relationship ([I'm an E0 on this scale.](http://i.imgur.com/hPuGKes.jpg)).

You're her friend, she knows you socially. She doesn't know these people. If she chooses, she might never have to interact with them again, thus there's no room for things to get awkward.  It's not necessarily about sex being special. \n\n"], [2, "I agree with what many other people have already said here, but I would like to add my take on this.\n\nI have a pretty firm friend boundary, particularly with males. I am actually polyamorous (currently in a monogamous relationship, however), and used to attend parties like you describe.\n\nI have people who I consider friends with benefits where that line has obviously been blurred. This only happens if it is a friend I am, in theory, willing to lose, **or** if the relationship started off sexual and never progressed to romantic. I don't like anonymous sex, so everyone I've hooked up with ends up as a friend in some capacity. \n\nWhere I have hard lines with friendship are when they are a very, very good friend. I'll use my two best friends to demonstrate two different reasons why these boundaries exist for me.\n\nFirst is a guy I've been bffs with for over 10 years since we were in middle school. One day he blindsided me by telling me he was in love with me after 5 years of friendship. I'd *never* felt that way for him, but in recent years, I have found myself wanting to have sex with him. I know that if I were to tell him this, he would be all for it.\n\nBut he, like most of my friends, is a monogamous person. Assuming becoming sexual and eventually transitioning back to a platonic friendship could be achieved without any issue or hurt feelings (which many people find too difficult), his future relationships would then be what could cause it all to fall apart. \n\nI would not be cool with him lying to a future partner about our having had sex in the past, and honestly, when it comes to people who are mono, it is incredibly difficult to be accepted as the female best friend (being poly makes this even more of an issue for them, too). So there is a lot of potential for complication.\n\nOne of the only ways I have been able to gain trust is to let their partner's know that nothing has ever happened, and if it was going to it already would have some time in the past 10+ years that we've been friends. If I lose that argument, I'd have to wish upon a star that they find a girl who is more open-minded/secure/trusts him sufficiently. Most likely, he will find a girl who will struggle with us being *soo* close and having a sexual past and I don't want to be the reason for her to suffer silently, and if she suffers not-so-silently then it could be even messier. I don't want to be a \"secret friend\" or be forced to take a friendship hiatus until the relationship ends, or have a friend who has to lose an otherwise great partner because she's uncomfortable with our past. Perhaps she should be more secure/open/trusting, but I would genuinely sympathize with how she felt about it.\n\nWith my other best guy friend I have never had those thoughts for him and never would. Sure, friends are family, I regard the guy I mentioned above as family, but for some of them, (like this other guy for me) they can feel so much so that I feel the same revulsion as I would if actual family were to watch me have sex. I love our friendship the way it is, it will never be anything but platonic, and I don't want to blur the lines with that and have our dynamic possibly change by increasing the risk that he sees me in a different way.\n\nSo, with the first guy, since I do feel some amount of physical attraction to him, I am turned on by the idea of him watching or having sex with me, *but I won't because I believe it could present problems in the future that would threaten our friendship and I simply value it far too much.*\n\nWith the second guy, *it's just not there.* He is my brother through and through and while I know he is a sexual being and we talk about sex openly, actually seeing him or having him see me in the act makes me want to gag and is far from sexy (I should mention that this guy is objectively very conventionally attractive, but we are of a closeness that makes him unappealing to me, regardless). If pheromones actually exist, maybe that has something to do with it, I don't know.\n\nThere are no set dynamics between two people, relationships of all kinds can exist in many different ways. I had dated a guy for a long while where we were very physically affectionate and connected on every level, but never quite had sex. I don't really know why, I was surprised I didn't even care all that much to with him despite finding him attractive. We simply accepted the relationship for what it was and it worked for us (we were both having sex with other partners on and off while we were together).\n\nI know a few of my straight female friends blur barriers of affection and friendship with me sometimes but would never, ever have sex with another woman. Some of them have different boundaries, feel different levels of comfort with certain people, ect... In the same vein, I am very, very affectionate with a couple of my gay male friends and they are with me, some of it is borderline sexual, but they would **never** have sex with me or any other woman. \n\nRelationship dynamics are as fluid as anything else, and while logically it makes sense that two consenting, unrelated people who get on well/are attracted to each other should be comfortable with having sex, the dynamics of human relationships simply don't exist in a vacuum.."], [1, "The friend zone is really a myth.\n\nIt's fine you blur boundaries between platonic friendship and physical intimacy but the fact that others like to keep things separated doesn't mean they deliberately put up this 'barrier'. Physical intimacy (apart from a hug, pat on the shoulder etc) isn't part of most people's friendships, so you are the outlier here. I would absolutely not appreciate it if a friend of mine started kissing me and touching me. I like these barriers and I expect my friends to respect this. If they don't, they aren't my friend.\nThis has nothing to do with being comfortable; you're really not looking at this from another perspective. I am 100% comfortable with my platonic friends, I just don't want a sexual relationship with them in any way. If a friend of mine wanted to cross my boundaries, he/she'd be told no and if they did not respect this, I'd end contact."]], [[{"comment": "Two reasons - her affection is just affection for a friend and she doesn't like you more than that, and/or social privacy.

This is tricky because you can't even ask \"do you prefer if I just act or should I verbalise my intent and ask permission for my actions?\" because that itself will cause them to \"lose the moment\".

I also only go into monogamous relationships because I like the stability of a relationship and there aren't that many people I'm attracted to who are also polyamorous like me, so I conform to being exclusive out of respect for the other.

I am actually polyamorous (currently in a monogamous relationship, however), and used to attend parties like you describe.\n\nI have people who I consider friends with benefits where that line has obviously been blurred. This only happens if it is a friend I am, in theory, willing to lose, **or** if the relationship started off sexual and never progressed to romantic. I don't like anonymous sex, so everyone I've hooked up with ends up as a friend in some capacity. \n\nWhere I have hard lines with friendship are when they are a very, very good friend. I'll use my two best friends to demonstrate two different reasons why these boundaries exist for me.\n\nFirst is a guy I've been bffs with for over 10 years since we were in middle school. One day he blindsided me by telling me he was in love with me after 5 years of friendship. I'd *never* felt that way for him, but in recent years, I have found myself wanting to have sex with him. I know that if I were to tell him this, he would be all for it.\n\nBut he, like most of my friends, is a monogamous person. Assuming becoming sexual and eventually transitioning back to a platonic friendship could be achieved without any issue or hurt feelings (which many people find too difficult), his future relationships would then be what could cause it all to fall apart. \n\nI would not be cool with him lying to a future partner about our having had sex in the past, and honestly, when it comes to people who are mono, it is incredibly difficult to be accepted as the female best friend (being poly makes this even more of an issue for them, too). So there is a lot of potential for complication.\n\nOne of the only ways I have been able to gain trust is to let their partner's know that nothing has ever happened, and if it was going to it already would have some time in the past 10+ years that we've been friends. If I lose that argument, I'd have to wish upon a star that they find a girl who is more open-minded/secure/trusts him sufficiently. Most likely, he will find a girl who will struggle with us being *soo* close and having a sexual past and I don't want to be the reason for her to suffer silently, and if she suffers not-so-silently then it could be even messier. I don't want to be a \"secret friend\" or be forced to take a friendship hiatus until the relationship ends, or have a friend who has to lose an otherwise great partner because she's uncomfortable with our past. Perhaps she should be more secure/open/trusting, but I would genuinely sympathize with how she felt about it.\n\nWith my other best guy friend I have never had those thoughts for him and never would. Sure, friends are family, I regard the guy I mentioned above as family, but for some of them, (like this other guy for me) they can feel so much so that I feel the same revulsion as I would if actual family were to watch me have sex. I love our friendship the way it is, it will never be anything but platonic, and I don't want to blur the lines with that and have our dynamic possibly change by increasing the risk that he sees me in a different way.\n\nSo, with the first guy, since I do feel some amount of physical attraction to him, I am turned on by the idea of him watching or having sex with me, *but I won't because I believe it could present problems in the future that would threaten our friendship and I simply value it far too much.*\n\nWith the second guy, *it's just not there.* He is my brother through and through and while I know he is a sexual being and we talk about sex openly, actually seeing him or having him see me in the act makes me want to gag and is far from sexy (I should mention that this guy is objectively very conventionally attractive, but we are of a closeness that makes him unappealing to me, regardless). If pheromones actually exist, maybe that has something to do with it, I don't know.\n\nThere are no set dynamics between two people, relationships of all kinds can exist in many different ways. I had dated a guy for a long while where we were very physically affectionate and connected on every level, but never quite had sex. I don't really know why, I was surprised I didn't even care all that much to with him despite finding him attractive. We simply accepted the relationship for what it was and it worked for us (we were both having sex with other partners on and off while we were together).\n\nI know a few of my straight female friends blur barriers of affection and friendship with me sometimes but would never, ever have sex with another woman. Some of them have different boundaries, feel different levels of comfort with certain people, ect... In the same vein, I am very, very affectionate with a couple of my gay male friends and they are with me, some of it is borderline sexual, but they would **never** have sex with me or any other woman. \n\nRelationship dynamics are as fluid as anything else, and while logically it makes sense that two consenting, unrelated people who get on well/are attracted to each other should be comfortable with having sex, the dynamics of human relationships simply don't exist in a vacuum..", "id": "dar71oc"}, {"comment": "Very interesting response! Thank you so much!\n\nI can relate a lot with the overthinking you demonstrated for your first mentioned bff. I tend to think a lot about the what ifs in life and recently I have been changing in that sense. If something is supposed to happen, it will happen no matter how much you try to prevent it. Likewise, if you go for something you might find everything works out perfectly. For example, in your situation I would probably go for it and explain that I want to remain as just friends (things can change after the sex, but you can't promise anything). Whoever he finds to start a relationship with should be understanding, otherwise he wouldn't be true to himself if he stopped talking to you just to please his new gf. I know it's a bit more complex than that, no matter how understanding you try to be, feelings are no rational and they can come when you think you won't have them. But I would probably just accept whatever consequences as the unpredictability of life, the ups and downs of this roller coaster.\n\nWith your second example I am curious: he is attractive, sexual and you talk about sex. I have a similar bff. However, did he ever do something flirty? Something sexually forward for the kind of friendship you have? What I mean is, now that you are bffs you probably are comfortable physically, so it takes something more to signal your interest. And in the beginning of your friendship it doesn't take much to signal sexual interest. I believe that when you let this physical comfort come with time and you never go far from it, you enter a state of mind where you can only see the other person as a friend. However, when someone does something a bit more forward sexually, you suddenly realise \"oh, I know where this person is getting at\" and sometimes you hadn't even thought about the possibility, but this out of ordinary gesture made you evaluate the possibility and perhaps you decide you want to try.\n\nI had something similar with my ex, except we were monogamous. I had no clue about the different needs you have in a relationship, as it was my first relationship. It lasted quite long because we trusted each other, loved each other, felt comfortable telling each other everything, were very affectionate, etc. I was extremely attracted to her body but we had little sexual chemistry, since I'm very sexual and all out and she was very reserved and prude and I prefer someone a bit wilder, sexually. Because of the monogamous relationship we were in I eventually had to end it because I wanted to have sex with other people, while still loving her. She was actually very understanding and instead of breaking up suggested we took some time where I could be with whomever. This turned out to be kind of an open relationship because we would still do all the things we used to do as a couple, including cuddling and sex. But every single night I would hook up with someone I would always go to her place to sleep. I loved her and she was the person I wanted to spend the night with, the person I wanted next to me when I woke up, despite all my sexual depravities.\n\nAs for your starting point, some of these people I have sex with at the parties either start off as sexual and never progressed to romantic, like you said, or they started as friends. Either way, I feel like they are closer to me in a different way, it's hard to explain. I feel like it's easier with them to be myself than it is with some of my oldest, closest friends. It may be because in the past I didn't have much physical affection with friends, so these new friends I make have something that the others don't, and physical affection is very powerful as a bounding agent for relationships. Of course I still trust my oldest, closest friends more than I trust these new ones, I can count on them like family. However, I don't feel I can be myself as much as I am with my new friends, because these new people are very open and the secretive environment of our sex parties helps the bonding too.", "id": "dargu61"}, {"comment": "Haha, while I *do* have a tendency to overthink, I don't believe I'm overthinking that particular situation - just being realistic and planning ahead. If we were to hook up, our friendship would be fine since I'm poly and because he happens to be surprisingly friendly with every single one of his ex's and past hook ups, despite how badly things may have ended (fairly uncommon for monogamy). \n\nI know he would never stop talking to me because of a girl, but I think he'd be more likely to try and keep our friendship more discreet or end up leaving the relationship (I've been his best and most consistent friend for 12 years, so our friendship is no small thing to him). If the girl's only major flaw was her issue with me that doesn't necessitate that the relationship was bad/unhealthy or that they were incompatible. \n\nIf I felt I had actual romantic feelings for him, I would ultimately risk it. But I'm not willing to jeopardize our friendship and/or add an unnecessary stressor that could potentially interfere with his ability to find a great girl and happiness over *just sex*. I'm sure he's not *that* amazing in bed, haha :p\n\nThe second guy is interesting. We became friends because we were dating each other's best friend. We just \"get\" each other in some profound way and there is no one else on earth I have more fun with. He makes me an infinitely better version of myself. \n\nWe have been friends for close to 10 years now. In that time we have lived together, traveled the country alone together, and my parents practically adopted him and he comes to family reunions and virtually every family event we have. I trusted him more than any other guy *because* I felt so platonic and sibling-like with him and that seemed to be utterly reciprocated. He was my only male friend who didn't ever, not once, make a single sexual advancement toward me or develop feelings. \n\nUnfortunately that changed this last spring when he revealed he had about 8 years worth of feelings for me. I am not convinced he truly does/did though, because he kept bringing up about *what everyone else* was saying - because our closest friends and family  think we should be together. I just wonder if hearing that for so long finally got in his head. But for me, at least, there is absolutely nothing there sexually or romantically. \n\nBut because of comments from family and friends (and **only** because of their comments), *of course* I have thought it. It would be so much easier if something, anything, could develop between us beyond friendship. I mean, even from our discussions about sex I know we'd probably be sexually compatible as we have many of the same kinks and similar sex drives. \n\nBut no matter how hard I've tried over the years, I simply could not stomach the idea of being anything more than we are. Gun to my head, I would rather fuck my cousin than fuck this guy. He's too close, it's just not there, we are perfect on paper, but I can't explain it. *Something repels me.*\n\nI think your ex relationship is what my current relationship is now! Haha. I'm still gathering the courage to end it over our sexual incompatibility. It's far more complicated than that, but we've talked about it and he is unwilling to open up our relationship in any capacity (he used to be very open to it but circumstances and his mental stability have since changed, so I understand). It really sucks when everything else in the relationship is great, but one major need is going unmet. :(\n\nIt's why monogamy feels like a prison to me. If he would do as your ex did and give consent for me to have sex with others, he would be the one I would come home to every night. We could keep our relationship, keep loving each other, continue building our life together. But monogamy means I either remain miserable and absolutely unsatisfied *or* I lose the most important person in my life, which is its own kind of misery. I would be *very* surprised if I ever try monogamy again. I gave it one more go, and it's ending in heartache precisely *because* of its limitations. It's just not for me.\n\nI understand what you are saying about your friends. I have that sort of relationship with my poly friends, things are utterly different with them and there are boundaries I can cross with them that I wouldn't normally with the others - and the sole reason I can't with my other friends is because they are monogamous and are/will date monogamous people. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand what you are saying and how you are thinking and I feel the same, personally, for most of it. \n\nIf that best friend I'm physically attracted to was not monogamous, I'd be having sex with him, no doubt. But eventually he *will* be in a monogamous relationship again and sex is simply not worth the trouble it would likely cause for everyone involved.\n\nThe reality of the situation is that we live in a monogamous world, and our dearest friends and loved ones are monogamous people so sometimes compromises need to be made with their world to make everything go smoothly. Ultimately, for me, that means not boning my best friend so he doesn't experience stress in any of his future relationships because of it, haha.\n\nQuestion - is this friend you posted about monogamous when in a committed relationship?", "id": "daroxti"}], [{"comment": "The friend zone is really a myth.\n\nIt's fine you blur boundaries between platonic friendship and physical intimacy but the fact that others like to keep things separated doesn't mean they deliberately put up this 'barrier'.

There's a whole big, bad world of relationship variations out there with different levels of interpersonal commitment that don't rely on sexual monogamy as a reinforcing tool. \n\nIf you can't bring yourself to talk about this to a woman you're thinking of marrying, then I have two additional pieces of advice.\n\nFirst, if you're gonna marry, you should be able to share and discuss anything with your partner. Hopes, fears, dreams, desires, fantasies, wants, needs. \n\nIf you've got stuff you feel you *can't* bring to your partner, that stuff *must* be hidden, then perhaps marriage isn't your best option. In my world trust is paramount to getting that close to someone. If you can't trust someone implicitly, then it's perhaps best to not tie yourself together legally and fiscally in the eyes of the State. Think hard on that. \n\nSecond, if you've got an overpowering desire to sew your wild oats, and you're not capable of separating the practice of monogamy from the institution of marriage, then perhaps marriage again isn't your best path forward. \n\nYou can love someone without marrying. You can sleep with someone without marrying. But I don't think you can have a lasting and successful marriage without open trust and communication. \n\nIf you've got these wants and needs that you just can't be open about, my advice is, sex stuff aside, you're probably not ready to marry just yet. \n\nGood luck.

If you ARE willing to discuss technique and his responses I can defnitely help pinpoint a solution.\n\nOne thing is that his tip could be too 'ticklish' for your normal technique, or even blowjobs in general.  Next time pay attention and see if he responds better if you don't lick the tip, or even suck less.  \n\nI'm not really ticklish like that during a bj, but I'm EXTREMELY ticklish after I cum.  She can't suck or lick the tip AT ALL after or I'll go spastic.  It's not really 'ticklish', but it's the best way I can describe it.  \n\nIt could be something else with the technique that his parts are too sensitive for (and he doesn't have the heart to say it), or maybe you need to add something else to GET HIM GOING.  Again I don't mean to pry, but if you play with his balls a lot he may not like that - or if you don't at all he may want more.  Myself, I can't have my balls played with until I'm REALLY into it.\n\nI guess the main my main point here is to think about your technique and try to write out (to yourself) what the technique IS.  If he's not being honest then something isn't working for him.  It's NOT anything YOU'RE doing WRONG - it's probably something specific to him that (a) he likes and you're not doing, (b) he doesn't like and you are doing, or (c) he doesn't KNOW he likes and you're not doing.\n\nGuys are different, just like women.  Some like it one way and some another.  For instance I don't like fast or aggressive blowjobs - I like them very slow, deliberate, and intimate with a lot of eye contact.  Slow, firm strokes and slow bobs. Of course it has to speed up toward the end, but still not like you're trying to start a fire.  \n\nI don't like my balls played with much, but I LOVE for the spot just underneath to be massaged (if you slightly lift them and push in underneath you can feel where the penis continues inside the body underneath the balls).\n\nThe main thing is to keep at it.  It's clearly something YOU enjoy doing, which is something MANY men would kill for.  Each time you do it change up ONE element, whether it's adding something, taking something away, or doing one thing different than you had before.\n\nIf he really DOES want daily bj's and doesn't have the heart to tell you something, then I KNOW you can identify and fix the problem.  BUT there's also the distinct possibility he's TELLING THE TRUTH and truly doesn't want too much of a good thing, as nonsensical as it seems to me...

She did it once or twice to remove the 'never' tag and is now actively avoiding it.

This is usually due to patients not taking all doses as prescribed, the wrong antibiotic being prescribed for the species and location, or drug resistance on the part of the bacterium. That last one is quickly becoming a very big problem for the three big names in bacterial venereal infections: *Chlamydia* infections, gonorrhoea, and syphilis.\n\nDrug resistance is a huge problem with *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, we're running out of effective antibiotics very quickly and there are some strains that are resistant to all of them. Combined antibiotics are now the only reliable way to cure gonorrhoea and these treatments will eventually become ineffective as well.\n\nThis is not as big of a deal with *Chlamydia trachomatis* or *Treponema pallidum pallidum*, but drug resistance is still a growing issue with these pathogens as well.\n\nAs far as the issue of false positives and false negatives, this depends on what test was performed. For *Chlamydia trachomatis* cultures are considered to have a lower sensitivity and a higher specificity while nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are considered to have a higher sensitivity and a lower specificity. So cultures are more likely to give a false negative and less likely to give a false positive when compared to NAATs which are less likely to give a false negative but more likely give a false positive. Sensitivities are higher for endocervical specimens than urine specimens for both. I'm not sure which assay is more popular but I am under the impression NAATs are the go-to more often than cultures are for venereal infections. \n\nBut yeah, you're correct that the three most likely possibilities are that you never had a *Chlamydia* infection, were reinfected, or the prior treatment failed.", "id": "dapnc8f"}]]], "5fvgfl": ["[lube] is there any lube that comes in a bottle that does not leak? for fucks' sake", "2016-12-01 11:05:36", 32, "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5fvgfl/lube_is_there_any_lube_that_comes_in_a_bottle/", [[15, "We never had the Sliquid bottles leak on us and they get thrown around quite a bit.

I have a theory about this, because I have experienced something along these lines.\n\nI'm a 25f. I usually can orgasm very quickly whether I'm by myself or with a partner. However, there are different layers of orgasm that I can experience. One is pretty generic and clitoral that I receive from oral or manual play. One is more intense and I can only get from a partner by being fingered, and sometimes by PIV penetration. I can't give this one to myself. And the third is a super intense, longer lasting orgasm that I can usually only give myself.\n\nI have been with a couple partners who were able to achieve this level of orgasm for me. However, it took a lot of time, and I had to really focus and guide them to get there. \n\nI'm wondering if when you began dating, she was happy with the first tier of orgasm that I mentioned (as I would be), but as your relationship progressed she realized that you were actually able to get her to that super intense tier? That's what makes the most sense in my experience. If I'm with someone who can get me there, I will absolutely try because it's a totally different experience when someone gets you there for you. \n\nAs for the multiple orgasms, I have generally had the same experience your partner has. I can cum so easily by being fingered that I can have tons of orgasms before the session is over, and sometimes one is right on the back of the previous one, especially if I'm totally comfortable and in the zone with my partner. For me, it will take longest to cum from oral, then by PIV, then shortest by being fingered. I know every girl is different, but I do agree that my first one takes longer than the multiple ones after that."], [5, "Longer build-up = better release, all else being equal."], [4, "> do women who get multiple orgasms usually take longer to get to the initial one?\n\nFor me, the Really Good Ones are often a longer climb up to the first peak, as it were. Of course things vary from day to day, and occasionally I can immediately blast off into multiples within a couple minutes, but if I am feeling like buildup is taking a very long time (but continuing to happen) and I stay patient and keep breathing and let things happen on their own time, I can get strings of profound multiples. As far as tips, I can only offer them from the girls position, but my biggest tip is: don't chase/force the release too soon, with clenching and holding her breath and stuff. Physically adjust your body until it feels like you are 'in-line' and have a good balanced clench in your core on both sides, keep your breathing relaxed and nethers unclenched, and think dirty intimate thoughts and once you're over the hump, the orgasms should be epic and the multiples feel endless."], [4, "As a female who regularly has multiple orgasms, what you said is pretty much spot on. It takes the longest for my first o and then you could pretty much keep doing anything and I'll keep climaxing over and over and over again for the rest of the session until my partner gets tired. For me at least, it's the buildup to the first one that takes the longest and all the other ones only need a minute or two."], [3, "From experience, if she's \"right on the edge\" for 30 minutes, when she finally gets there, it's going to be super powerful, probably resulting in more if you don't stop and keep going. The built up sensation is what's causing the multiple orgasms, me thinks."], [2, "I actually didn't find that birth control affected my orgasms. (Although it did diminish my sex drive.) \n\nThe longer the buildup, definitely the more powerful your orgasm will be (for me anyways). I think you see a correlation between long buildup and multiple orgasms due to her being less sensitive. For example, if she orgasms quickly, she will be pretty sensitive and it'll be hard to continue. But if you've been working on her for a long time, she'll be less sensitive and then can continue stimulation past a single orgasm. \n\nSo I guess your question is, can you achieve multiple orgasms but in less time? I've found that incorporating a vibrator helps. The vibrations numb and desensitize the area a little, but it's still powerful enough to get me to orgasm quickly. So I can usually knock out multiple orgasms with a vibrator in a short time period no problem. \n\nI love getting a combo of oral, fingering, and vibrator. It allows for constant stimulation without my boyfriend having to be stuck down there constantly. He can move around but always reapply the vibrator to keep stimulation constant. Having him do different things all at once is also better for my mental stimulation, so bonus haha.\n\nGood luck!"], [1, "For me, birth control nearly stopped my ability to orgasm all together so it can 100% affect the time it takes.

I have a theory about this, because I have experienced something along these lines.\n\nI'm a 25f. I usually can orgasm very quickly whether I'm by myself or with a partner. However, there are different layers of orgasm that I can experience. One is pretty generic and clitoral that I receive from oral or manual play. One is more intense and I can only get from a partner by being fingered, and sometimes by PIV penetration. I can't give this one to myself. And the third is a super intense, longer lasting orgasm that I can usually only give myself.\n\nI have been with a couple partners who were able to achieve this level of orgasm for me. However, it took a lot of time, and I had to really focus and guide them to get there. \n\nI'm wondering if when you began dating, she was happy with the first tier of orgasm that I mentioned (as I would be), but as your relationship progressed she realized that you were actually able to get her to that super intense tier? That's what makes the most sense in my experience. If I'm with someone who can get me there, I will absolutely try because it's a totally different experience when someone gets you there for you. \n\nAs for the multiple orgasms, I have generally had the same experience your partner has. I can cum so easily by being fingered that I can have tons of orgasms before the session is over, and sometimes one is right on the back of the previous one, especially if I'm totally comfortable and in the zone with my partner.

Of course things vary from day to day, and occasionally I can immediately blast off into multiples within a couple minutes, but if I am feeling like buildup is taking a very long time (but continuing to happen) and I stay patient and keep breathing and let things happen on their own time, I can get strings of profound multiples. As far as tips, I can only offer them from the girls position, but my biggest tip is: don't chase/force the release too soon, with clenching and holding her breath and stuff. Physically adjust your body until it feels like you are 'in-line' and have a good balanced clench in your core on both sides, keep your breathing relaxed and nethers unclenched, and think dirty intimate thoughts and once you're over the hump, the orgasms should be epic and the multiples feel endless.", "id": "dapjmn2"}], [{"comment": "As a female who regularly has multiple orgasms, what you said is pretty much spot on.

(Although it did diminish my sex drive.) \n\nThe longer the buildup, definitely the more powerful your orgasm will be (for me anyways). I think you see a correlation between long buildup and multiple orgasms due to her being less sensitive. For example, if she orgasms quickly, she will be pretty sensitive and it'll be hard to continue. But if you've been working on her for a long time, she'll be less sensitive and then can continue stimulation past a single orgasm. \n\nSo I guess your question is, can you achieve multiple orgasms but in less time? I've found that incorporating a vibrator helps. The vibrations numb and desensitize the area a little, but it's still powerful enough to get me to orgasm quickly. So I can usually knock out multiple orgasms with a vibrator in a short time period no problem. \n\nI love getting a combo of oral, fingering, and vibrator. It allows for constant stimulation without my boyfriend having to be stuck down there constantly. He can move around but always reapply the vibrator to keep stimulation constant.

It's strange though as you had been talking on-line first where you think you'd establish some sort of connection.

I think many men so women who 'sleep around' as fine for a casual thing but they would rather settle down with someone who is sexually more selective (which makes sense from an evolutionary point of view). So I think by having sex very early on, even if you've spent a lot of time messaging/skyping, many men may no longer consider you girlfriend material and rather keep on looking (even though they themselves also had sex on the first/second data; double standard, I know). \n\nI think the solution is to just not have sex so soon, even if you feel like it. I have spent a lot of time on-line dating and didn't sleep with any of the guys I met (probably around 30 in the past 3.5 years). I've gone on three dates max, most just one date. I just didn't like any enough. However, because I don't want to fall into this 'trap', if I really do like someone, I intend not to sleep with him on the first few dates. It's easy to lust after someone, especially after spending a lot of time talking online, but you don't know each other until you spend time in each others company for real. Best to just have the first few dates in public (dinner, drinks, lunch, coffee) and don't go home with him/don't invite him to yours. You'll have more time to reflect on whether or not you really like him, and if you find out you don't, at least you didn't sleep with him which may make it more painful if you figure out after a few dates he's not for you.

As a result, usually when sex comes up, it usually makes me feel like, \"Hold on, we can't do any of this until I know how serious I am about this relationship because I don't want her to feel hurt/used or think things are advancing faster than they are.\" So, a lot of times the physical stuff will be advancing at a steady pace and then it gets to the tipping point where I feel like I just have to pause it to sort things out otherwise I'll feel like I'm taking advantage or confusing the other person.

However, this is totally different from a personal connection you make when being on a date/hanging out (I know because I've done a lot of on-line dating; never slept with any of them though because I didn't like any enough). I think many men so women who 'sleep around' as fine for a casual thing but they would rather settle down with someone who is sexually more selective (which makes sense from an evolutionary point of view). So I think by having sex very early on, even if you've spent a lot of time messaging/skyping, many men may no longer consider you girlfriend material and rather keep on looking (even though they themselves also had sex on the first/second data; double standard, I know). \n\nI think the solution is to just not have sex so soon, even if you feel like it. I have spent a lot of time on-line dating and didn't sleep with any of the guys I met (probably around 30 in the past 3.5 years). I've gone on three dates max, most just one date. I just didn't like any enough. However, because I don't want to fall into this 'trap', if I really do like someone, I intend not to sleep with him on the first few dates. It's easy to lust after someone, especially after spending a lot of time talking online, but you don't know each other until you spend time in each others company for real. Best to just have the first few dates in public (dinner, drinks, lunch, coffee) and don't go home with him/don't invite him to yours. You'll have more time to reflect on whether or not you really like him, and if you find out you don't, at least you didn't sleep with him which may make it more painful if you figure out after a few dates he's not for you. I don't think any guy is going on 10 dates with someone just to have sex, so I think not having sex until you know each other better will weed out the guys looking for sex only and also help to 'protect your heart'.", "id": "daodk4g"}], [{"comment": "I don't have a real response to your question, but my boyfriend once told that if we had had sex  in that first night, he wouldn't have asked me out because he would have gotten everything he wanted.

I don't mean you should break up, but if you truly want to be with this man for the rest of your life you have to be prepared. If you ever have children, expect your sex life to take a *huge* hit.

Because a lack of experience sometimes makes a difference (that's what it was with me- originally he was too focused on getting his and didn't focus enough on me, and I got too anxious trying to please him that we both just got stressed when it became a horrid experience each time for me). \n\nI'd suggest setting the mood long beforehand - devote a day to just trying to reset the expectations of sex in your head. Put on sexy music, wear something that makes you feel sexy. Spend a LOT of time on foreplay - do anything and everything that feels sexy and enjoyable before penetration. \n\nAnd then I'd wait and make that the new normal for a little while (at least a couple of weeks, maybe more depending). That way, rather than instinctively bracing yourself for a bad time, you can start to enjoy sexy times. \n\nWhen the time comes for penetration in the future, introduce it really slowly- also try stimulating your clit/other places on your body during the process, it helps.

Makes it seem than it's more important to gather all the people that were victims of one sex (to raise awareness about it), than to debate how it is reasonable to feel in every case, pondering all the aspects of the situation, which includes gender, too. Which is good, if it's about that, but it doesn't need to be put against the women's reality. This isn't a war or a competition, every gender has it's own set of issues.\n\nIdk, I'd rather stay away from threads like this. People become very paranoid, thinking everyone that doesn't agree with the common mantra is a sexist jerk and is implying men's feelings don't matter, unless he's constantly stating that he's not dismissing them \u2014which is tiring and, even if you do that, it doesn't help. So, OP makes it like it's possible to talk about this, but there is actually no room for debate because some people are obsessed with things like double standards, when in fact the realities we face regarding our gender are different, hence the double standard not being a double standard, but more of just a distinct approach to a distinct reality.\n\nAnyway, my personal experience with this, which is what OP asks about, is this: \n\nI haven't been assaulted, but I have felt used \u2014by women that, allegedly, liked and/or loved me\u2014, and it feels very much shitty. When you've told them, over and over, that sex isn't working for you, them still initiating when they feel like it like those conversations didn't occur is disrespectful, but since you may have been starving you may abide, and then you regret it after.\n\nSex is strange in this sense. It tells you that it's going to be fine, and you may proceed, rationally hoping it's going to be. But then the same feelings of every time start happening and you wish it was over already. In that sense, the approach being a men is, I believe, slightly different, because sex rarely hurts or is uncomfortable, physically speaking, while being penetrated is a much more sensible matter, bodily wise. So you may not feel like stopping as much as you would if you were being penetrated, but just waiting for it to be over. Then after it you'll feel like you've been used, and yet you'll blame yourself because you let that happen.\n\nWhat I mean with this is that, through that experience, I kind of understood women that 'change their minds' over or during sex.

I'll keep my story brief as it was several years ago.\n\nI used to work at a company that had a gorgeous indo woman with a great body, nice face, whole package.

I learned later that this woman was super in to me and just to shy to give me even a hint.\n\nAnyways, we were all at an xmas party, my gf at the time was at work so I was there alone in this massive house that a co-worker was house-sitting. There were maybe 20 of us there, including me and the Indo girl.  I have my beer on the counter and go to the washroom.  I get back, resume drinking, and start to feel funny.  I decide to step out for a bit and get some air.  I don't remember going outside, but I do remember her on top of me in one of the guest rooms, I know my pants were down, and her skirt was hiked up.  I just have fleeting images of the whole thing.\n\nI told some friends about it, but even my closest bros were pretty certain that because I was in to her, and if I were single I would have gone with it and slept with her anyways, that it didn't matter.  Even if I thought I was drugged I was \"in to\" her, so it wasn't really assault, I was just getting what I wanted.  I never did anything about it.  I did tell me gf and she said \"I hope you had fun, because I'm gone\".

The term where it's a make victim, or the term where it's a male perpetrator? Groups? And so on.\n\n\nPersonally, I think the way we make it clear that it's a problem is to talk about it. To get rid of the idea that men always want sex with any woman who offers. Just like we need to get rid of the idea that women are here only for male gratification and sexualization. Two sides of the same coin.\n\nBut I digress. The point is, drugged rape of a man isn't substantially different from drugged rape of a woman. Violent rape of a man isn't substantially different than that of a woman. Emotional manipulation into unwanted sex is not substantially different for a man than a woman.\n\nRape is rape.\n\nYes, women potentially have more severe consequences, but they also have more resources and support.

This theory doesn't make much sense to me, can you explain it more?\n\nFetish is something you need to arouse or orgasm. Brains are weird, people have all kind of fetishes, from innocent to funny to completely disgusting. Just as some people get aroused by same/another gender, people may get aroused from pizza/stockings/talking dirty/taking a bath/diapers/kids/holding hands/whatever. Your experience influences your fetishes. I am not telling you that you have lesbian fetish, you might, you might not.\n\nI had fetishes from porn, a lot of men do. I got rid of them by stopping watching porn and doing bait and switch the way I described. Fetishes are not bad, they just exist. I didn't want them, I got rid of them. Some fetishes are deeply ingrained, as deep as your sexuality, the line blurs somewhere. So it may just be the case that you are a lesbian.\n\n>And before I started to sleep with women, I didn't think about them, or anything, while having sex with men. I still closed my eyes instinctively because looking at them and their bodies just wasn't appealing to me in a sexual way.\n\nWell, my gf would close her eyes too and she didn't think of penises in a sexual way. After a month or so she stopped doing it and started to find my penis attractive. (With a bit of my help)\n\nModern culture objectifies women a lot. Advertising, music, etc. Modern media is filled with \"male gaze\". And almost no media sexualizes men. So a lot of women don't find men attractive. Or it's just genetics, some men don't get aroused by looks too and enjoy touching more. So you are not weird and this doesn't make you a lesbian.\n\n>As for trying to change the mindset from sex to making love, I've never had sex with anyone I've been in love with so I can't actually try that theory out.

It simply involves me being sexual with a woman. So if you want to put it within the context of fetishes, then i suppose you  could say that I have a fetish for women. But in that case, wouldn't anyone that likes to sleep with women have a fetish for women? It just doesn't make sense to me. \n\n>So a lot of women don't find men attractive.

Some women just don't get turned on by looks. They get turned on by personality, behavior, etc. It is just not a thing they consider important.

For me it's (significantly) hotter for a woman to do something kinky because she wants to and it turns her on than because she's obeying an instruction - even if I originally made her want it, that could only happen because she wanted to want it.

My primary concern is usually getting my girlfriend off. Don't get me wrong - when I enjoy it I enjoy it... but my mind is usually all on her. Is that not how it is supposed to be?\n\nAbout the question: Yes and no.\n\nMany of us enjoy a lot giving pleasure, but even then we must remember we're entitled to the same kind of attention and pleasures, too.\n\nSome men have luck in that they're *turned on* when they give pleasure, so they'll have erections while doing it. Mind that that's different from being rationally satisfied, as in, being satisfied of ourselves because we're capable of bringing peasure. Being turned on is a different thing. Other men will have a similar mindset and then have issues like erection issues, beause, rationally, they want to please their partner, but without the keys to the car (which, in a psychological ED case, is having a bit of a spark for being turned on), they won't be able to bring her to where they want.\n\nSo, again, yes and no. Yes as in, it's important to care about our partner's pleasure \u2014as the opposite of not caring\u2014, and no as in that it's equally important to remember about ourselves. Why would they be entitled to have an attentive lover, and not us? The only reasonable difference is that, admittedly, women usually are harder to please than men, so we need to compensate for that by forgetting a bit more about ourselves, but even then, if we actually do right what's expected from us, then we'd be even more entitled to get back what we deserve for having done a 'good job'.\n\nSo, if you always, or almost always, face sex as an effort, it's no wonder you end up feeling repulsed by it. In your subconscious it may even feel like she's taking advantage of you (hence your feelings of disgust/repulsion), but it may be actually you who has been unbalancing things from the start, being unaware of it.\n\nOur sexual moments have a lot of stages and time in them, so there's a place for everything there. We must make sure we're getting, too, what we deserve.\n\n>How do you mean?\n\nI meant if you had more conflicted feelings there, as you seemed more troubled in general.", "id": "darmhr9"}], [{"comment": "Diet?

Finish a blowjob like you normally would, but instead of keeping your mouth on him, open your mouth up and look up at him, stroking his cock and letting him cum onto your tongue. Some can miss, but keep it directed towards your mouth. Suck on him a bit more after he gets off, and let the cum run out of your mouth. Then  progress a bit more, stroke him off onto your mouth & lips, keeping your mouth a bit open, licking his cum off your lips. Again, try and keep it from going into your eyes.  \n\n- I bet he'll love both of these \"baby steps\" towards the real thing, and hopefully you can enjoy being in charge of his pleasure, in control of his fantasy coming to life. I'm *pretty* sure he won't mind you taking the lead on this: it's one way he can be totally sure that it's something you're doing with him, and not something he's doing *to you*. I'd also recommend lots of eye contact - it'll let him know you're present and engaged. Don't do this if you feel worried/nervous and you think your face will give it away, though ;)  \n\n- If you feel brave enough, do a little dirty talk. Whatever you want to happen, just ask him to do that, or tell him you want that. \"I can't wait to feel your cum\" / \"I need it on my tongue\" / \"Do you want to come all over me?\" etc.  \n\n- To avoid cum in your eyes, set things up so he comes *across* your face. You can lie down on the bed and he can be kneeling beside you. You can still stroke his cock, but now it should be going across your cheeks, lips, chin, and maybe nose... but not your eyes! If it *does* get in your eyes, wipe it up as much as possible, then use cold water like you said, but you can also use standard eye drops (like Visene) afterwards to reduce irritation.  \n\n- For me, a big part of the turn on of a facial is that the woman is totally turned on by me to the point that sex can be totally messy and she just won't care. And that she's craving my orgasm, and the cum that results. So when he does come on your face, don't stop there: keep sucking on him, lick the cum off his cock, use your fingers to eat it off of your own face.  \n\n- A variation that you could try is masturbating while this is all going on, and try and time your climax with his. That's basically my ultimate fantasy, and maybe he'd like it, too. You simply rubbing yourself while you get him off will probably be a turn on for him - again, it's showing him that you're really into what's happening, not just putting up with it.

Finish a blowjob like you normally would, but instead of keeping your mouth on him, open your mouth up and look up at him, stroking his cock and letting him cum onto your tongue. Some can miss, but keep it directed towards your mouth. Suck on him a bit more after he gets off, and let the cum run out of your mouth. Then  progress a bit more, stroke him off onto your mouth & lips, keeping your mouth a bit open, licking his cum off your lips. Again, try and keep it from going into your eyes.  \n\n- I bet he'll love both of these \"baby steps\" towards the real thing, and hopefully you can enjoy being in charge of his pleasure, in control of his fantasy coming to life. I'm *pretty* sure he won't mind you taking the lead on this: it's one way he can be totally sure that it's something you're doing with him, and not something he's doing *to you*. I'd also recommend lots of eye contact - it'll let him know you're present and engaged. Don't do this if you feel worried/nervous and you think your face will give it away, though ;)  \n\n- If you feel brave enough, do a little dirty talk. Whatever you want to happen, just ask him to do that, or tell him you want that. \"I can't wait to feel your cum\" / \"I need it on my tongue\" / \"Do you want to come all over me?\" etc.  \n\n- To avoid cum in your eyes, set things up so he comes *across* your face. You can lie down on the bed and he can be kneeling beside you. You can still stroke his cock, but now it should be going across your cheeks, lips, chin, and maybe nose... but not your eyes! If it *does* get in your eyes, wipe it up as much as possible, then use cold water like you said, but you can also use standard eye drops (like Visene) afterwards to reduce irritation.  \n\n- For me, a big part of the turn on of a facial is that the woman is totally turned on by me to the point that sex can be totally messy and she just won't care. And that she's craving my orgasm, and the cum that results. So when he does come on your face, don't stop there: keep sucking on him, lick the cum off his cock, use your fingers to eat it off of your own face.  \n\n- A variation that you could try is masturbating while this is all going on, and try and time your climax with his. That's basically my ultimate fantasy, and maybe he'd like it, too. You simply rubbing yourself while you get him off will probably be a turn on for him - again, it's showing him that you're really into what's happening, not just putting up with it.

Ugh.\n\nThis is a common question over on /r/SexToys (where, I might add, we moderate more strictly to prevent recommendations of unsafe materials and nastiness from users) and I always recommend the [CalEx Silicone Double Rider](http://www.calexotics.com/p-24578-silicone-double-rider.aspx). Similar structure to the one you posted, except it's made out of silicone (non-porous so it won't hold bacteria/mold; non-toxic so there's no leaching of plastic softeners agents to worry about). Comes in black and pink in the form shown, and somewhere else on their site is another Double Rider in like a \"beaded\" style in the same color options. I recommend showing them to your partner and asking her which she'd prefer, since she's receiving the item. \n\nEdit: also, despite the recs you're getting, I never recommend buying off Amazon. The listing may have great reviews and be well written, but then someone comes along and says \"oh yah I have one of these to sell\" and sends theirs in to Amazon to be sold -- except this new one is a crappy knockoff. You make your purchase on the listing, going by great reviews, and Amazon sends you one out of their \"box o' things people have sent us under listing 3958493.\" You don't know whether it was one of the good ones or the bad ones. It could be not silicone, but a TPR cast of an original, which *appears* similar -- you wouldn't know the difference upon taking it out of the box, not until it started growing mold spots or leaching oil all over your drawer. :/ rather purchase from a legitimate retailer, try SheVibe or LoveHoney. I work at an actual store, so I've never actually bought from them myself, and I'm always reluctant to make Ofishul Recommendations in a position as a r/SexToys mod, but those are some commonly suggested options on the sub.

Then I would read a bunch of erotica that I knew would make me REALLY aroused... but I wouldn't touch myself. And I'd RESIST the urge to squeeze my legs together. I'd just keep reading and getting myself more and more aroused until I couldn't stand it anymore.

You've laid it out so nicely I'll just answer them one by one :)\n\n> Just to check, your doctor ran a urine sample to check for a UTI and a vaginal sample to test for a yeast infection, in addition to testing for any STDs? Did they also discuss the possibility of running a blood test to check your hormone levels?\n\nWe did rule out a UTI and yeast infection. This issue conveniently coincided with my annual pap, which was normal. Now that you say it, she may have mentioned hormone tests but I honestly can't remember :/ She did suggest my birth control pill (so yes to that question) may be causing dryness, but again it just doesn't feel like that's the case.\n\n> Regarding the pain, is it only internal or is there any vulvar pain as well?\n\nThe pain is only internal, but it does seem to be right inside the opening as the pain is immediate upon the slightest penetration. My vulva doesn't hurt to the touch. Maybe it's relevant here that I do seem to have a lot of (what I think is) hymen tissue, and sometimes it feels like that is what hurts or is a slightly irritated for a few days following sex.  \n\n> And how would you describe the pain? As swelling, muscle tightness, burning, stinging, knifelike? Where would you rate it on the pain scale?\n\nThe pain is sharp, so I'd say knifelike is the most fitting description of those. It's the only sensation I've ever had from sex that I can't bear, and I'll usually wince or be audibly in pain (which unfortunately just sounds too much like sex moans).\n\n> Have you ever had any kind of vulvovaginal pain before this, even if it seems unrelated?\n\nThis is relevant to my above response about irritation. It feels like it could be my hymen or even around my urethra, as it's a similar but far lesser irritation to a UTI. I have it right now actually. This usually occurs in the few days after I've had sex. Other than that, I've just had dull vaginal soreness, but it has always felt pretty normal for a lot of sexual activity.\n\n> And have you ever had any vulvovaginal infections?\n\nAs a teen/adult I haven't had more than a UTI.\n\n> Finally, are you taking any medications (e.g., oral birth control)?\n\nI take the oral contraceptive Beyaz, and I am on levothyroxine for autoimmune hypothyroidism.\n\n> I ask because I have vestibulodynia (a subset of vulvodynia) and vaginismus, both of which are vulvovaginal pain disorders. Vestibulodynia is characterized by pain of the vulvar vestibule (e.g., just around the outside of the vaginal opening and right inside it), often provoked by penetration. \n\nI'm so sorry you have to deal with all that pain! Thank you for sharing that, though, because I had been ignoring that possibility due to ignorance. I thought pain disorders were something you'd feel right from the first time.\n\n> Vaginismus is a tightening of the vaginal muscles, which can make penetration uncomfortable.\n\nInteresting since when the pain happens it does seem like penetration is physically difficult even if he weren't trying to be mindful of my pain.\n\n> I have secondary provoked vestibulodynia. Secondary means that I had a period of pain-free penetration: I didn't first experience pain with sex until I was 24. Provoked means that the pain is caused by something rather than constant. In my case, penetration or pressure on my vulva (e.g., from sitting or tight pants) provoke pain.\n\nWow, that was pretty eye-opening to see this didn't become an issue for you until you were around my age. I suppose I may have had minor irritation from certain tight pants (especially sitting in them), but it doesn't really feel like what I feel during sex.\n\n> I'm not a doctor and can not by any stretch of the imagination diagnose you, but I can give some advice on what tests to ask for from your doctor and, if you do end up having a vulvovaginal pain condition, what to expect in terms of treatment and resources for you (e.g., online support groups).\n\nI would appreciate some direction so much. While the condition is daunting, having some things to ask about makes going back to a gyn less so. Is it more something you manage/is always a present issue rather than something that can be overcome?\n\n> Feel free to PM me if you'd prefer to discuss this in private.\n\nI don't mind keeping it in the comments since I'm fairly anonymous. I think what you've added so far has been really informative and it would be good for anyone who stumbles across this thread with the same issue. Since you're sharing your experience too, though, I don't mind moving it to PMs either if you'd like :) Again, thanks so much for responding. \n\n**Oh, edited to add that on the pain scale I'd say a 6 or 7.**", "id": "dan90k6"}, {"comment": "Vestibulodynia is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion. It's idiopathic, meaning they don't know what causes it yet, so it's basically vulvovaginal pain with no clear cause. \n\nBut, even though it is a chronic condition, some women do find treatments that cause their pain to go into remission without any relapses. And sometimes it goes away on its own.\n\nMy first pain episode started in the summer of last year. Like you, I'd had a bit too much rough sex, but my vagina just wouldn't stop hurting. Doctors couldn't do anything, and after a few months (at least four) suddenly it went back to normal. Then another pain episode began this past June and it is ongoing. \n\nIn terms of being diagnosed with vestibulodynia, after any possible infection and a hormone imbalance are eliminated, a diagnosis can be given based on your history, symptoms, and the Q-tip test. That's where the doctor lightly touches around your vulva and the opening of your vagina to see if you feel pain.\n\nThe issue can be that, even though this a common vulvovaginal issue (research estimates that anywhere from 15 to 18% of reproductive aged women will have vestibulodynia at some point in their lives), very few gynecologists know anything about it or how to treat it.\n\nSo you may want to see if your gyno is familiar with it and, if not, find one who is. The International Pelvic Pain Society has a [database for finding a specialist near you](http://pelvicpain.org/patients/find-a-medical-provider.aspx) (if you're in either Australia, Canada, Colombia, Israel, the Netherlands, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK, or the US). You can also join a vulvodynia support group on Facebook and ask users for recommendations for a doctor in your area.\n\nRegarding oral birth control, some types have [been shown to provoke vestibulodynia](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22birth+control%22+AND+%22vestibulodynia%22&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C14&as_sdtp=&oq=%22) in some women. One woman on a vulvodynia support group forum reports that [Beyaz provoked hers](http://vulvodyniasupport.forumotion.net/t897-birth-control-pills-can-cause-vestibulitis). Oh, as a sidenote on terminology, *vulvar vestibulitis* is an outdated term for vestibulodynia. \n\nI know in some cases that discontinuing use of oral birth control can resolve the symptoms of vestibulodynia, but it may require other treatments too. I was actually chatting a while back with a woman who had hers provoked by oral birth control and she used some topical hormone creams that really helped. I can message her and see if she would be willing to weigh in, if you would like.\n\nRegarding pain making penetration difficult, vestibulodynia can often cause vaginismus. Basically, once our mind starts associating penetration with pain, it causes our pelvic muscles to tense up. Tense pelvic floor muscles make penetration physically difficult.\n\nThe best treatment for that is pelvic floor physical therapy. I've learned a lot of simple exercises and massage techniques to loosen those muscles up and help myself relax.\n\nOh, regarding when people first start experiencing symptoms, \"[the onset of symptoms is most common among women between the ages of 18 and 25](http://www.healthywomen.org/condition/vulvodynia).\"\n\nAnd I'm sorry to hear that your pain is so high.

You definitely took the right step in denying her and telling her to cum for you. Use one specific phrase, \"cum for me now\" or similar, every time that you allow her to orgasm.

This can be great fun to tease and torture her in public because all you have to do is say it. In addition to a phrase, you may also want to incorporate a physical gesture.

If she isn't forthcoming with what she really wants when you try to discuss it, try working it into the sex play itself. Tell her she better get permission before cumming. When she asks for it, deny her the first time and tell her she needs to earn it. When she asks again or asks what she needs to do to earn permission, make her confess a hidden sexual fantasy to you and tell her if it isn't good enough, she won't get permission. If she is into the denial/permission thing, which it seems like she most definitely is, she will likely be incredibly turned on by that point. I have found that this both makes me want to do anything to get permission and also makes me willing to do things (i.e., talk about fantasies) that you would be reluctant to do otherwise. It is very easy to get carried away with what you are doings/saying when you are immersed in a super hot scene and the strangest stuff can come out of your mouth.\n\nIn my experience, after you break the ice on these sorts of things, it becomes easier and easier to actually discuss it, which can lead to some seriously hot stuff and also take your relationship/love to a whole new level.\n\nAs for learning to switch gears, just remember that having you do this IS what makes her hot. So by embracing it and having a good time doing it, you are in fact still focusing on giving her what she wants. I am generally super submissive in the bedroom, but my partner occasionally likes the domineering type to show up to play, and while it was a bit awkward for me initially, knowing how hot she found it made me feel the same way (or maybe even better) as I do when giving her pleasure any other way."], [1, "She wants you to take more control and be more dominant.

You're in control, you have the say-so. Its an attitude, its a mindset. There is a big difference in my husband from when we have 'normal' sex (whatever that is, lol) and when we 'scene', which is where we do still have sex, but he's in control, tells me what to do, when I can and cant cum, decides what we're doing and, this is a biggie, when it stops! \n\nI'd like to suggest you visit r/bdsmcommunity, I know it might seem like it doesn't fit right now, but when you take away the B&D (bondage and discipline), and the S&M (sadism and masochism) you're left with D&S (dominance and submission) in the middle which is the core of the whole thing, without which (I think) the rest wouldn't really work, and is very enjoyable on its own, without all the ropes and flogging \ud83d\ude0a ", "id": "dapkx2e"}, {"comment": "Thank you!

You know her limits better than we do!) but also about what you're into and what the desired outcome is.. To put it in his words, \"Do you want her to have fun, or not be able to walk the next day? To remember having a good time, or to have a little twinge every time she gets up out of a chair? It heavily depends on the activity as well. If you do some impact play then maybe she really likes spanking so you can go at that for a while, but maybe she's not as much of a fan of the cane so don't use that for as long, or its a punishment so she has the opportunity to avoid it.

If you come over to r/BDSMcommunity it will become very apparent very quickly that while on the surface, to most people, it seems like the Dom has all the power (they call the shots etc) what actually happens is that they are only empowered by the fact of the submission of their partner. I choose to submit to my husband, and I **give** him the power. Without that, there is nothing. I also have, within my power, my safewords. If I use a safe word I can pause or completely stop any activity at any time if I feel uncomfortable, unsafe or unhappy with anything that happening. Your wife is doing the same, she gave you the power by asking your permission to cum, but at any time she can withdraw that submission, that's the power exchange.\n\nThat became a bit of an essay, so tl;dr know your wife, know what she likes and her limits, let her empower you with her submission and empower her in turn with safewords (stoplight system is good)", "id": "dapsyyw"}, {"comment": "This comment just deserves a high five *High five*", "id": "daqia3w"}, {"comment": "Lol thank you \ud83d\ude04 ", "id": "daqjyrl"}, {"comment": "Thank you so much, this is incredibly helpful and insightful!

If your wife is capable of multiple orgasms, even explore the idea of ruining one of them as \"punishment\". \n\nAnother thing that is huge with my wife is contrast. The rough, and dominant with moments of sweetness and intimacy. Denial of contact. Don't let her touch you. If you tell her she can't gave something, she will not only want it but NEED it. One time my wife literally cried when I put my penis in her mouth sweetly because I had denied her any physical touch of me and had her blindfolded. It's mind blowing the power and control you can have, but the biggest mind fuck is she is actually the one in control.

If she isn't forthcoming with what she really wants when you try to discuss it, try working it into the sex play itself. Tell her she better get permission before cumming. When she asks for it, deny her the first time and tell her she needs to earn it. When she asks again or asks what she needs to do to earn permission, make her confess a hidden sexual fantasy to you and tell her if it isn't good enough, she won't get permission. If she is into the denial/permission thing, which it seems like she most definitely is, she will likely be incredibly turned on by that point. I have found that this both makes me want to do anything to get permission and also makes me willing to do things (i.e., talk about fantasies) that you would be reluctant to do otherwise. It is very easy to get carried away with what you are doings/saying when you are immersed in a super hot scene and the strangest stuff can come out of your mouth.\n\nIn my experience, after you break the ice on these sorts of things, it becomes easier and easier to actually discuss it, which can lead to some seriously hot stuff and also take your relationship/love to a whole new level.\n\nAs for learning to switch gears, just remember that having you do this IS what makes her hot. So by embracing it and having a good time doing it, you are in fact still focusing on giving her what she wants. I am generally super submissive in the bedroom, but my partner occasionally likes the domineering type to show up to play, and while it was a bit awkward for me initially, knowing how hot she found it made me feel the same way (or maybe even better) as I do when giving her pleasure any other way.", "id": "daqrz0q"}, {"comment": "That is GREAT advice. She definitely is timid about it so making part of it would certainly help. Follow up, how often are you the domineering type vs. \"normal\" sex? Does she always initiate that or do you take on that role unexpectedly for her?  Thanks again!", "id": "daqty8t"}, {"comment": "It really depends on the mood we are in, but power exchange plays at least a small role in our sex pretty frequently because we both enjoy it - can range from something small (like her telling me to rub her back instead of asking), to something long, elaborate, and drawn out (she was 'slave for the week' around my birthday a while ago).\n\nIt can be initiated by either of us as well. Sometimes she initiates it by telling me she heard *insert dominant personality name* was in town this weekend, or she will answer 'Yes Sir\" when I ask something mundane like 'have you picked something out for dinner tonight'. I will initiate it by randomly 'getting her in trouble' for random things (e.g., you didn't receive approval of your panty choice).\n\nNow that we are more comfortable with it, it flows a lot more naturally and we both just play off how the other is reacting and go with it. But it is also good to 'de-brief' in a way after play time is over. For example, when she collapses on you and says wow that was so hot, ask her what made it so hot. She has already admitted to it being hot, so it can be easier to get some more information about what exactly she is in to, which will allow you to figure out any other directions to take it.", "id": "daqvjw2"}, {"comment": "Thank you so much for taking the time to answer this.

Of course, men are easier to satisfy, but that doesn't mean we need to go to the other end of the pole, where you seemingly went.\n\nAlso, a sexual relationship has enough place for different moments. You focusing on her most of the time isn't incompatible with starting pursuing your pleasure at one point (and by that, realise that, with intercourse, there's the happy coincidence of you pleasuring yourself pleasing the other part). By that matter, make sure you're actually sharing your thoughts and sexual wishes, and not repressing them.\n\nReally, it's not incompatible at all to be selfish and selfless. Selfish is a word that has a negative connotation, but it's actually good to pursue your interests, as long as you don't dismiss those of your partners.

Am I expected to reciprocate action while this is going on? Does it seem like I am being selfish if I don't touch him back simultaneously?\n\nThough children speak of \"bases\" when lying about their nascent sexual experiences to one another, sex is not mathematics. There is no primary order of operations. You're both presumably consenting adults; do what feels good in any order you like. \n\nToss \"expectations\" out of the vocabulary here; try focusing instead on \"wants\". How empathic are you? Are you good at reading your partner as you're making out on the couch? Are they expectant? Nervous? Moaning softly? Grunting and snorting like they're going into rut? Are they thrusting their hips towards you and making gutteral sounds while gesticulating wildly at their crotch? \n\nPeople's reactions here matter. Some folks like going slower, some faster. How slow or fast *you* proceed is all about you, your comfort level, how turned on you feel, and what you feel like you wanna do. There really is no special directive on what you should try. \n\n>what do I do next? Whether it's simultaneously or sequentially, I have never figured out the hand job. I think I am OK at incorporating it into a BJ\n\nHandjobs, like all sexual activities, run the gamut. There are lots of ways to give 'em and what works best varies from partner to partner. Your hypothetical couch-boy might enjoy being rubbed through his clothes, or perhaps he'd like for you to take that zipper down and grab a handful of meat directly. Some guys like the feeling of being rubbed through their underwear. Some guys like being rubbed softly; some like being pumped like you're trying to bring water up from a well. \n\nAs with blowjobs, some guys will cum happily from a handjob. How far you take it and how professionally you apply it depends on what else you wanna do. \n\nYou mentioned only you've ever made you cum before - part of the reason for that is because you know how to stimulate you best. If you wanna get around that, communication is gonna be key. Try telling the guy what you want and how you want it. Put him to work the way that ticks all your buttons. \n\nBut guess what? Communication happens in both directions, and for the same reasons. Instead of wondering what to do with your hands, why not try asking your partner? Give an experimental rub or tug, then feel free to ask what they like the best. Maybe have him masturbate for you so you can see how he does it, then copy those motions. Add or release pressure in response to his moans (or requests). \n\nAsking what someone wants in bed doesn't have to be boring. Try doing it while you're nibbling on an earlobe, or perhaps after gently sucking on a nipple. You'll usually find your audience is *very* attentive. \n\nAs for the *mechanics* of the handjob, lube usually helps a bit, particularly so with circumcised men. Any lube you like will probably do here, from hand creams to cocoa butter, to baby oil (or mineral oil if you dislike the scent), to massage oils and purpose-built lubes like ID Glide. Spit works, though imo is best applied with the mouth (which leads to a combination hj/bj, which you said you've already figured the basics out for), and reapplication is often necessary. \n\nAgain, communication is big here. Some guys like having their shaft stroked. Some enjoy their scrotum being played with or squeezed; others have nuts that are so sensitive that this is painful. Some guys love having a thumb run up and over the glans; others find that too intense, and like a steady jerking motion. Ask. You could also try a few things, and see what gets the best reaction, but I find words are a great shortcut.\n\n> In the \"making out on the couch\" situation, it seems like too fast/much to move straight to oral, but I am not against it as an alternative to the awkward hand/penis interaction. I also hesistate to give oral right away because I am afraid he will think that means that I want oral and honestly I'm not a big fan of receiving it.\n\n... we're back to communication. You're able to tell us here you're not particularly fond of being eaten; share that with your partner if/when it comes up.\n\nMost guys will be very happy receiving oral from you. If you'd prefer they not give it, and you're worried they will feel they aren't doing enough to please you, give 'em something else to do. Tell them how you want your clit stroked, or hook them up with a toy you like and have them use it on you while you're both in a 69 position on the couch. (Lady on top works well, so if he's an oral fiend he can still enjoy the scent and taste of you from the toy.) \n\nAs for moving to under-the-pants action? See the first note about no order of operations for sex. Do what you want, when you want it, how you want it. If you're making out and horny, and you want some under-the-pants fun, open up his pants and go down on him. Get him good and hard. Then sit up, nibble his ear, and tell him how you want him inside you.\n\nThe handjob question won't come up. \n\nGood luck. "], [2, "Firm but not too tight grip, deliberate strokes. Make sure your hand isn't positioned in such a way that it will constantly rub against the head if he's circumcised (chafe = ouch, this is OK with lube though). Don't try yanking down super hard or you'll yank the skin where the foreskin and head meet. Feel free to stop and play with his balls too, though some guys don't like that. \n\nKeep in mind that this is just stimulation and foreplay - most guys don't really appreciate a handjob from someone else unless it's leading to something else or as part of a blowjob. It's not personal - even if you do a great job, you don't have years of building muscles for those movements so you're probably going to get tired before he comes. \n\nI got painfully reminded of that fact last night. Figure it's worth sharing. "], [1, "Everyone is different and everyone's expectations are going to be different. \n\nWith the guy I'm correctly with it depends on the day? Sometimes when he starts touching me, I'll follow suit and do some over the pants action (pretty light and nothing very specific) and if I feel like it, I'll unbutton his pants and do the beginnings of a handjob. But generally that's only if I intend for it to move right to sex. We usually have some clothing removal during this part and then it goes from there...\n\nI don't think it's selfish of you not to though. And (as I'm sure you know) a blowjob doesn't have to fall in there at all. In my experience, a guy touching you is enough to make him hard, so there doesn't always need to be direct stimulation for him. That being said, every guy is different.

Am I expected to reciprocate action while this is going on? Does it seem like I am being selfish if I don't touch him back simultaneously?\n\nThough children speak of \"bases\" when lying about their nascent sexual experiences to one another, sex is not mathematics. There is no primary order of operations. You're both presumably consenting adults; do what feels good in any order you like. \n\nToss \"expectations\" out of the vocabulary here; try focusing instead on \"wants\". How empathic are you? Are you good at reading your partner as you're making out on the couch? Are they expectant? Nervous? Moaning softly? Grunting and snorting like they're going into rut? Are they thrusting their hips towards you and making gutteral sounds while gesticulating wildly at their crotch? \n\nPeople's reactions here matter. Some folks like going slower, some faster. How slow or fast *you* proceed is all about you, your comfort level, how turned on you feel, and what you feel like you wanna do. There really is no special directive on what you should try. \n\n>what do I do next? Whether it's simultaneously or sequentially, I have never figured out the hand job. I think I am OK at incorporating it into a BJ\n\nHandjobs, like all sexual activities, run the gamut. There are lots of ways to give 'em and what works best varies from partner to partner. Your hypothetical couch-boy might enjoy being rubbed through his clothes, or perhaps he'd like for you to take that zipper down and grab a handful of meat directly. Some guys like the feeling of being rubbed through their underwear. Some guys like being rubbed softly; some like being pumped like you're trying to bring water up from a well. \n\nAs with blowjobs, some guys will cum happily from a handjob. How far you take it and how professionally you apply it depends on what else you wanna do. \n\nYou mentioned only you've ever made you cum before - part of the reason for that is because you know how to stimulate you best. If you wanna get around that, communication is gonna be key. Try telling the guy what you want and how you want it. Put him to work the way that ticks all your buttons. \n\nBut guess what? Communication happens in both directions, and for the same reasons. Instead of wondering what to do with your hands, why not try asking your partner? Give an experimental rub or tug, then feel free to ask what they like the best. Maybe have him masturbate for you so you can see how he does it, then copy those motions. Add or release pressure in response to his moans (or requests). \n\nAsking what someone wants in bed doesn't have to be boring. Try doing it while you're nibbling on an earlobe, or perhaps after gently sucking on a nipple. You'll usually find your audience is *very* attentive. \n\nAs for the *mechanics* of the handjob, lube usually helps a bit, particularly so with circumcised men. Any lube you like will probably do here, from hand creams to cocoa butter, to baby oil (or mineral oil if you dislike the scent), to massage oils and purpose-built lubes like ID Glide. Spit works, though imo is best applied with the mouth (which leads to a combination hj/bj, which you said you've already figured the basics out for), and reapplication is often necessary. \n\nAgain, communication is big here. Some guys like having their shaft stroked. Some enjoy their scrotum being played with or squeezed; others have nuts that are so sensitive that this is painful. Some guys love having a thumb run up and over the glans; others find that too intense, and like a steady jerking motion. Ask. You could also try a few things, and see what gets the best reaction, but I find words are a great shortcut.\n\n> In the \"making out on the couch\" situation, it seems like too fast/much to move straight to oral, but I am not against it as an alternative to the awkward hand/penis interaction. I also hesistate to give oral right away because I am afraid he will think that means that I want oral and honestly I'm not a big fan of receiving it.\n\n... we're back to communication. You're able to tell us here you're not particularly fond of being eaten; share that with your partner if/when it comes up.\n\nMost guys will be very happy receiving oral from you. If you'd prefer they not give it, and you're worried they will feel they aren't doing enough to please you, give 'em something else to do. Tell them how you want your clit stroked, or hook them up with a toy you like and have them use it on you while you're both in a 69 position on the couch. (Lady on top works well, so if he's an oral fiend he can still enjoy the scent and taste of you from the toy.) \n\nAs for moving to under-the-pants action? See the first note about no order of operations for sex. Do what you want, when you want it, how you want it. If you're making out and horny, and you want some under-the-pants fun, open up his pants and go down on him. Get him good and hard. Then sit up, nibble his ear, and tell him how you want him inside you.\n\nThe handjob question won't come up. \n\nGood luck.

Make sure your hand isn't positioned in such a way that it will constantly rub against the head if he's circumcised (chafe = ouch, this is OK with lube though). Don't try yanking down super hard or you'll yank the skin where the foreskin and head meet. Feel free to stop and play with his balls too, though some guys don't like that. \n\nKeep in mind that this is just stimulation and foreplay - most guys don't really appreciate a handjob from someone else unless it's leading to something else or as part of a blowjob. It's not personal - even if you do a great job, you don't have years of building muscles for those movements so you're probably going to get tired before he comes. \n\nI got painfully reminded of that fact last night.

Other women I've been with had multiple orgasms pretty easily on a one-night stand - and we didn't have that much of an emotional connection.\n\nI was surprised I didn't find anyone else saying this. Also, I'm sure you'll still get upvoted and I'll very likely get downvoted because your version of events makes people feel good. I'm not saying that connection isn't helpful, I'm just doubtful that it's the only factor involved.\n\nBTW, I'm not some young guy saying this.

In our situation, the context of the event was a very emotional and personal growth focused time.  It could very well have coincided with some kind of biological change.  \n\nBut in my experience the more emotionally connected i have been with women the more likely they are to have more and better orgasms.  \n\nBut i also think it depends on the woman.  The more secure a woman is in herself or able to let go of those insecurities in those moments the more likely she will be able to have an orgasm.  I think the root is a healthy sense of self love, however in lieu of that a deep emotional connection can create a safe space and I think make up for anxieties/insecurities.  \n\nI like the discussion.

The real \"magical connection\" is the incredibly deep emotional one.

She was an amazing home maker, mother and giving human being. I was career focused, and arrogant.  I was a great provider, father and generous.  However I underestimated her and didnt recognize her complexity (which she was good at hiding). We were (and ARE) best friends and lovers, but the passion had waned. As our kids started to become adults and leave we had a crisis of identity (she was a stay-at-home mother since 19).  We had a deep emotional bond, but I don't think there is a upper limit on how strong it can get.  \n\nShe became more comfortable in her own skin and I became less arrogant.

The sex and orgasms are just a byproduct of the real magic we have, but its way too hard to put those into a catchy reddit subject.\n\nThink of it this way, the thrill of NRE (new relationship energy) can be DWARFED by the intense emotional and mental connection that can ONLY come from 20+ years of shared life experiences and that intense emotional and mental connection CAN manifest itself in new and amazing sexual experiences.

The real \"magical connection\" is the incredibly deep emotional one. But this is /r/sex so you gotta grab the headlines yo!! My wife had a hard time letting go of her anxieties/fears and was at times crippled by her insecurities. She was an amazing home maker, mother and giving human being. I was career focused, and arrogant. I was a great provider, father and generous. However I underestimated her and didnt recognize her complexity (which she was good at hiding). We were (and ARE) best friends and lovers, but the passion had waned. As our kids started to become adults and leave we had a crisis of identity (she was a stay-at-home mother since 19). We had a deep emotional bond, but I don't think there is a upper limit on how strong it can get.\nShe became more comfortable in her own skin and I became less arrogant. The rest sort of just fell into place. The real point of my post is that human beings are complex, and ever changing. A relationship can improve in unimaginable ways even after 20+ years of growing up together. The sex and orgasms are just a byproduct of the real magic we have, but its way too hard to put those into a catchy reddit subject.\nThink of it this way, the thrill of NRE (new relationship energy) can be DWARFED by the intense emotional and mental connection that can ONLY come from 20+ years of shared life experiences and that intense emotional and mental connection CAN manifest itself in new and amazing sexual experiences.

But till you talk to her. you won't know anything or go anywhere with this. Even if she isn't into girls. You might have a few days of weirdness after. But least no more awkward....should I go for it ? thoughts. while your rubbing lotion into her. Where if you if you try to kiss and grope her. you get charged for sexual assault. So don't think with your lil brain. Think with the big one. \n\nI hope you figure it out.

If so, she's probably doing all of this to get you to make the move. Since showering together is generally a sexual thing, next time that happens, just offer to help wash her back. Then maybe slide your hands around her waist and up her stomach and so forth and slowly get to the chest area and see how she reacts. Let your bodies touch, you are naked and wet and soapy after all lol. Honestly you should know how it's going to go just by rubbing on her. If she doesn't know you're into girls, she may just be one of those girls who is comfortable with other girls in all shapes and forms and isn't necessarily trying to get with you. My absolute best friend is like that, and a few years ago (before she found out who she was sexually) I approached her about a 3 some with me and my husband, and she said no very politely (which is a good thing because it would have been a HUGE mistake) I said that I completely understand and appreciate her not being weird about it. We talk daily and are closer now than ever. I was also a lesbian before I met my husband, so just from MY experience, if she knows you're into girls and is being this close you.....go for it! \n\nEdit: if you are just too unsure about progressing physically, I would absolutely just have a talk with her. The fact that she's comfortable enough to sleep with and shower with you, should make the talk super easy. Like a previous post said, go along the lines of \"hey I feel like weve become great friends and I really enjoy being roommates with you because you're awesome. I just wanted to talk about how I'm into girls and I'm becoming attracted to you and I need to know if the feelings are reciprocated at all. No matter what I don't want to lose the friendship or being roommates, I just want to know how you're feeling.\" I would suggest doing this in a non sexual setting, maybe over a meal or while you're casually hanging out together alone. If anything she should take it as compliment that you're becoming attracted to her or she will tell you she likes you too but is shy, and there's your start on taking the lead.

I enjoy sex, and I ask for sex, but . . . do you mean like, being the center of attention? Totally receiving? I have sometimes, but I just feel uncomfortable if it's been too long, I think.

I still need to touch on the other aspect, which is arousal, and thats you positives. Recreating the positive experiences you had when you were really turned on and minimizing the negative once is a first step. Thats a kind of setting a stage, a thing that should happen before you get to touching. Since the timing seems to be an issue for you, pick a day. A sexy exploration day, if you will. Don't make an orgasm a goal, I know it sounds counter productive, but lets try a bit of reverse psychology. Say you are not allowed to have an orgasm. His goal is your orgasm, though.\n  \nOkay, well...lets get practical than.  \n  \nBeing present is a psychological practice, but its been pretty relevant in yoga, so it seems to be getting popular. Its often mentioned in \"mindfulness mediation\". Paying attention to your breathing, feeling the pressure of your cloth on your body, feeling the heaviness of your feet on the ground... Sounds familiar? In yoga its usually about breathing and your pulse and things like this. But the concept is also applicable to other things in life like food. Not just throwing a toast in yourself like fuel, but paying attention to the taste, texture, etc. It's also about ability to notice other things that come to your mind (example, while  having sex \"oh, I gotta water the plants\"). You notice those things, and you put them aside for later. You acknowledge them, their importance, and you set them aside to be dealt with when its appropriate. Right now you are in a moment. \n  \nSame practice is used in sex. Its about concentrating on the feelings versus the thoughts. So that is your job, concentrating on how things feel. When they feel good, let him know. When they don't, ask to move on. Communication isn't a glamorous thing, but its a must.\n  \nNow this what he should be doing. Start by touching all those non genitalia areas (feet, legs, arms, hands, neck, head). Meanwhile you notice how it feels. Tell him about things you liked. Try rocking and rotating your hips bringing your attention to the clitoris. You may try to do some kegels as well \u2013 do it in patterns or by following your heartbeat. On this point he is still not touching your clitoris. When you feel ready (read: when you really really want to continue) he can move to indirect stimulation. Try different things and tell him what feels best:\n  \n  - Gently pinching labia between fingers,\n  \n  - Tug labia from side to side\n  \n  - Put gentle pressure around the clit by moving skin around it (try different pressure, different speed, different patterns)\n  \n  - Placing his palms against your inner thighs, so that his thumbs are pressing against your labia\n  \nTry rocking your hips towards this pressure if it feels good. Let him do this as long as it feels good, paying attention to the pleasurable sensation.\n   \nNow to the direct stimulation. For the most people it only feels good to be touched this way only after you are aroused. So follow your gut. Don't just agree to move to the next stage because the first two took too long. This is for you, and your partner agreed on this because he wants this too.\n  \nHe can try these things: \n  \n  - Lightly touch the head of the clitoris with a steady back-and-forth motion. He can do it slow, fast, with light pressure, with deep pressure, anything in between. Communicate to him which feels good.\n  \n  - Rub circles around clitoris with fingertips\n  \n  - Tug upward on the clitoris from clitoral hood (again, varying numbers of fingers, pressure and speeds)\n  \n  - Flick upward from just under the head of the clitoris (with variation, again)\n  \nPay attention to your body, to the way things feel. If anxieties or worries surface, acknowledge them and set them aside to worry about later and return your attention to the sensations you are experiencing. Allow yourself to relax your abdominal muscles and just breath. If you start getting frustrated over elusiveness of orgasm, remind yourself that your goal is pleasure.

Instead of saying \"public sex\" you could use the term \"public foreplay\" and it would capture the concept *far* more succinctly, in a way that the majority of redditors would grasp and understand, *without needing to define terms*.\n\nYou may want to call this an argument over semantics, but (to get into semantics, ironically) that implies it's a distinction which is meaningless.  This is not a meaningless distinction.

Asked me to use a toy on him during sex...", "2016-12-02 22:29:16", 331, "https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5g57rf/confidence_destroyed_fiance_told_me_my_vagina/", [[157, "I've seen a lot of good comments here but nothing that feels comprehensive, so I'm going to include good points from previous commenters as well as some I think have been missed.\n\n1) I understand why this has freaked you out. If \"feels good but isn't as tight as I would prefer\" is a direct quote, he DEFINITELY could and should have found a better way to say it. That said, you DON'T need to be freaked out. You two have been having mutually enjoyable sex for quite a while, right? You've given him a bunch of orgasms? He's been able to come inside your vagina and expressed positive feelings about the sex you have? If so, there's no reason for you to be worried that he won't be satisfied with your body. He is and has been. And, unless you only started having vaginal sex after he proposed, he knew what your vagina felt like and decided he wanted to spend the rest of his life with it. Don't worry.\n\n2) The fact that he masturbates is totally normal, especially since it seems like he's often away from you on business trips. My partner makes me come (hard, and often multiple times) pretty much every day, and I still masturbate with porn and toys once or twice a day. (Note: I work from home.)\n\n3) It may not actually be about tightness. Some masturbation sleeves are highly textured inside and feel totally different from ANY actual body \u2014 like using a vibrator compared to rubbing with hands. Some men really enjoy the visual aspect of watching their partner use a toy on them. Even if it IS about tightness, that doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. I use dildos that are way bigger than my partner's dick, and sometimes my partner uses them on me while he jerks off. It doesn't mean I don't love my partner's dick.\n\n4) If it IS about tightness, there may be reasons behind that besides just preference, and there are some things you can do or try:\n  (a) He may be masturbating with a death grip. A lot of guys start out that way and have trouble adjusting to coming from sex with a partner, which just isn't going to be as tight as a squeezed fist. It may help for him to work on loosening his grip when masturbating \u2014 although changing the way you masturbate isn't always easy, so keep in mind that that may be difficult for him.\n  (b) Do you use condoms during vaginal sex? Some men have serious difficulty achieving orgasm while wearing a condom, and if he's one of them, masturbating into a synthetic vag may be a way around that. If wearing a condom makes it harder for him to come, you could try alternatives, such as female/internal condoms; I used those with a guy who had a hard time coming from vaginal sex, and they made it way easier for him.\n  (c) You can strengthen your vaginal walls, increasing tightness, by using Kegel exercisers. A lot of sex toy companies make them, and there's virtually zero work required by you. I use the ones by [Fun Factory](https://us.funfactory.com/en/smartballs/), and they're definitely effective; my boyfriend can tell the difference if I've used them for a day or two.\n\n5) As long as you both enjoy yourselves, there's nothing wrong with bringing toys into bed with both of you. What if you 69'd with toys \u2014 you using a sleeve on him, him using a dildo or vibrator on you? What if you masturbated together, perhaps while reading erotica or watching porn? What if you took control and used the sleeve on him in a dominant or teasing way in a long, drawn-out session (which is easier with a sleeve than with your vagina, since you can move it and stimulate him with more precision)? It may have gotten off to a bad start, but maybe this will turn out to be an awesome new thing in your relationship.\n\n6) The fact that he was willing to share with you that it's something he's interested in is something that you should be happy about, not take for granted. He may feel conflicted or guilty about it himself. Talk with him and see where it goes!\n\nHope this helps!"], [482, "His response wasn't the best, but let's be honest with ourselves, many women in relationships with men use dildos. Even with their fellow right there and willing for PiV sex. As long as he doesn't only use the fleshlight it's really not any different. Toys of all kinds can spice things up and add pleasure.\n\nPlus, the problems with \"your\" tightness aren't your fault, they're more likely because he grips very hard when he jerks off. There is nothing wrong with you.\n\nSo, he's tactless, but I don't really know why you pushed him either or are upset that he would choose masturbation over sex.

It feels different though, like a natural vagina is incredibly stimulating in a different way but isn't as tight whereas the fleshlight needs to be tighter to compensate for not being quite as great as a real vagina.  Usually I prefer the real thing but sometimes a different feeling is nice too, it's a totally different feeling."], [-1, "[removed]"], [-1, "[removed]"]], [[{"comment": "I've seen a lot of good comments here but nothing that feels comprehensive, so I'm going to include good points from previous commenters as well as some I think have been missed.\n\n1) I understand why this has freaked you out. If \"feels good but isn't as tight as I would prefer\" is a direct quote, he DEFINITELY could and should have found a better way to say it. That said, you DON'T need to be freaked out. You two have been having mutually enjoyable sex for quite a while, right? You've given him a bunch of orgasms? He's been able to come inside your vagina and expressed positive feelings about the sex you have? If so, there's no reason for you to be worried that he won't be satisfied with your body. He is and has been. And, unless you only started having vaginal sex after he proposed, he knew what your vagina felt like and decided he wanted to spend the rest of his life with it. Don't worry.\n\n2) The fact that he masturbates is totally normal, especially since it seems like he's often away from you on business trips. My partner makes me come (hard, and often multiple times) pretty much every day, and I still masturbate with porn and toys once or twice a day. (Note: I work from home.)\n\n3) It may not actually be about tightness. Some masturbation sleeves are highly textured inside and feel totally different from ANY actual body \u2014 like using a vibrator compared to rubbing with hands. Some men really enjoy the visual aspect of watching their partner use a toy on them. Even if it IS about tightness, that doesn't mean anything is wrong with you. I use dildos that are way bigger than my partner's dick, and sometimes my partner uses them on me while he jerks off. It doesn't mean I don't love my partner's dick.\n\n4) If it IS about tightness, there may be reasons behind that besides just preference, and there are some things you can do or try:\n  (a) He may be masturbating with a death grip. A lot of guys start out that way and have trouble adjusting to coming from sex with a partner, which just isn't going to be as tight as a squeezed fist. It may help for him to work on loosening his grip when masturbating \u2014 although changing the way you masturbate isn't always easy, so keep in mind that that may be difficult for him.\n  (b) Do you use condoms during vaginal sex? Some men have serious difficulty achieving orgasm while wearing a condom, and if he's one of them, masturbating into a synthetic vag may be a way around that. If wearing a condom makes it harder for him to come, you could try alternatives, such as female/internal condoms; I used those with a guy who had a hard time coming from vaginal sex, and they made it way easier for him.\n  (c) You can strengthen your vaginal walls, increasing tightness, by using Kegel exercisers. A lot of sex toy companies make them, and there's virtually zero work required by you. I use the ones by [Fun Factory](https://us.funfactory.com/en/smartballs/), and they're definitely effective; my boyfriend can tell the difference if I've used them for a day or two.\n\n5) As long as you both enjoy yourselves, there's nothing wrong with bringing toys into bed with both of you. What if you 69'd with toys \u2014 you using a sleeve on him, him using a dildo or vibrator on you? What if you masturbated together, perhaps while reading erotica or watching porn? What if you took control and used the sleeve on him in a dominant or teasing way in a long, drawn-out session (which is easier with a sleeve than with your vagina, since you can move it and stimulate him with more precision)? It may have gotten off to a bad start, but maybe this will turn out to be an awesome new thing in your relationship.\n\n6) The fact that he was willing to share with you that it's something he's interested in is something that you should be happy about, not take for granted. He may feel conflicted or guilty about it himself. Talk with him and see where it goes!\n\nHope this helps!", "id": "daq1gye"}, {"comment": "Thanks for your insightful input.

My guess is that he said what he said not because he meant it, but because he intentionally wanted to hurt you. Some people lash out at others when they feel hurt. \n\nDoes that make it okay that he said something incredibly hurtful to you? \n\nHell no. That is unacceptable, and it shows that he has quite a bit of maturing to do, both in terms of processing his emotions and communicating them to others.\n\nAnd should he have talked to you about using the toy together before springing it on you immediately after sex? Of course. That would have been much more sensitive and considerate.\n\nBut just keep in mind that he might not have meant it. \n\nIt's up to you if you want to try and talk to him and find out if that was case and, if so, continue to discuss the situation so that both of you can talk about how you feel. \n\nThat would mean you getting to share why the sex toy made you feel bad and how his comment hurt you, and him explaining how he felt about the sex toy and how he felt about your response to it.\n\nIf you don't feel comfortable doing that, or if he is unwilling to work this out with you, no one would blame you if you wanted out of this relationship. You don't have to be with someone who is going to put you down like that.\n\nAlso, just to reassure you, it is a good sign if your vagina isn't overly tight during sex. If you are both aroused and comfortable, your pelvic muscles will relax and your vagina will tent. When everything is going as it should, your vagina expands to make sex possible.\n\nOn this forum, I see so many couples struggle because the female partner isn't relaxed or aroused enough for penetration to happen. I'm in that boat: I have a vulvovaginal pain disorder and pelvic floor dysfunction. My vagina is incredibly tight, but that's because it's unhealthy and it makes penetration extremely painful for me.\n\nAnd even if your vaginal muscles were weak (which I highly doubt), you can always try doing Kegel exercises. Like any other muscle in your body, you can strengthen it.\n\nSo whether you stay with this guy or not, don't feel bad about yourself.

Sometimes I will fantasise about her in a girl on girl way with someone else who I am attracted to, other times it is not her at all. I would like to put this down to not communicating on an intimate level regularly (long distance relationship at the moment). \n\nBut yes, I definitely use masturbation as a coping mechanism as I am sure many people do. I have aches and pains all over my body from some mystery illness and it is nice to have a brief moment away from that... Also, feeling hungover = masturbate, feeling bored = masturbate. In fact it is rare that I will masturbate due to feeling aroused, it's almost always either routine or distraction. But I am fairly confident I am not alone in this.", "id": "dap5iia"}, {"comment": "Oh yeah that sounds like a healthy attitude towards masturbation. \n\nI just think that you need to tell her. Everyone fantasizes about others sometimes, but if you literally can't get off without thinking about someone else, that's a big red flag. She deserves to know what she's getting into. Especially when you know it would be a big deal to her, you need to be upfront with her so she can choose if she wants to be in a relationship like that. \n\nAnd that's kind of what I was getting at with my \"seek therapy\" thing. The only reason this isn't negatively effecting your relationships is because you aren't being honest. So if your girlfriend knew, and she said \"either stop or we are breaking up\" could you quit? Do you honestly think you have enough control over your fantasies that if you had to choose between your girlfriend or your fantasies could you stop? \n\nI just think you should be honest and deal with the repercussions. You shouldn't lie to your girlfriend and stay in a relationship where you need other people to get off. That's not fair to anyone. \n\nEdit: this is basically exactly your post.

You seem to tell yourself it's for her benefit but it's actually for your own. I feel like if you loved her the way you say you do, you would make sure she knew who you truly are so she can make her own decision about the relationship.

All fair points and yes I am sure my masturbatory habits are outrageous and the work of the devil. How do you suppose i approach this situation? \"Hi honey, how was work today? Shit was it? Uh-oh. Well, have I got news for you. I had a wank last week and I thought about an old school friend. Shall we go to the cinema tonight?\"\n\neuugh, I didn't want to bring this up, but it's related to weight gain and it being an issue for me. I don't want it to be but it is effecting my attraction to her I think. She used to be size 10-12 with some gorgeous curves and a radiant personality, but now she is a size 16+ and has lost some confidence along the way due to it... I have never put her down about it and am always positive because she hasn't had it easy. We both have put on weight to be honest, but anytime I try and encourage her to join me to eat healthy and get exercise it never lasts. \n\nI have seen suggestions on how to approach this before and none of them will work in a long distance scenario. We can't both join a gym, I can't cook healthy meals for us, and if I mention this frankly, it would be a complete disaster. She isn't happy with the weight gain either but she struggles to keep motivated on her own and with the stress of her day to day work. \n\nI don't want to leave her because I masturbate over other women sometimes, that is petty to throw away every other thing we have over something so trivial. Like I said, I know she does it too but it doesn't bother me so much. If I said the same to her she would think it's because of her weight and it would probably throw her into a deep depression and cause more harm than good. If I leave her (which I don't want to do) I can guarantee you it would destroy her as much as it would destroy me.

It doesn't matter how hard the conversation is. In fact, you worried about her being heart broken and leaving you is *exactly why you need to tell her*. You KNOW it would be a big deal to her. It's so wrong to know and keep that from her. \n\nLook, you need to say \"sweetie, I need to be honest with you about something. I love you a lot, but I often fantasize about other women. Please understand that this doesn't mean I don't find you attractive. Do you fantasize about other men?\" And then you can see if she also thinks about other people.\n\nIf she does, then great, hopefully she will understand and you guys will be fine. If she's doesn't think about other men often, she might say \"uh, how often do you think about other women? Oh you can't even get off thinking of just me? Well thats a deal breaker\" and she has the right to decide that. \n\nIt's going to be an incredibly hard conversation, but you need to have it.

It's a huge deal. \n\nIf you're losing attraction to your GF over her weight gain and attempts to improve the situation have failed, it might be time to consider leaving the relationship. She obviously isn't motivated enough to lose the weight, and there are plenty of men out there who will still be just as attracted to her new body. And vice versa, there are plenty of women with smaller frames for you to date. \n\nI never said breaking up was easy or simple. I know first hand how hard it is.

It really depends on how intense, frequent, and long-lasting these feelings are. \n\nI used to have a similar problem in that I kept falling in love with people while still loving my long term partner.

Porn is stimulating visually, while toys are stimulating physically.   That said, morally different?  That depends on the persons set of morals, and their sense of logic.

If it's only with you then it would seem like she could be jealous.  She perhaps thinks she can't compete with pornstars, and perhaps what she knows or thinks she knows about porn, she finds disgusting.   It's a form of ignorance in my opinion, but that's sort of another topic.  Anyways, if she uses her toys on herself on her own, then yes she is a complete unfair hypocrite.  She's using the sex toy as an aide, just as you use porn as an aid to masturbate.   Men in particular are very visual, so porn perhaps is more suitable to you than playing with toys.  \n\nThis should be a non-issue, so long as your porn habits are not interfering with performance and desire in your actual sex life.

In a completely abstract sense, neither should matter at all and a lot of couples do have relationships where porn and vibrators don't have anything to do with the other partner. But humans are complex and there's a bunch of social crap going on that makes them *contextually morally different* but not inherently morally different. Let me explain:\n\nA lot of women, myself included, have problems with porn that stem from feelings of insecurity because 'there's someone else there' and that is someone I think I am comparable to (which is irrational and untrue, I know, but like I said complex humans). I have also seen posts on here where dudes have expressed insecurity about their partner's vibrator, but these are much rarer. Not to invalidate those dudes feels, just that it seems to be more of a thing that women can be insecure about porn and while it is irrational, their feelings are valid.\n\nThe best explanation ITT is /u/HarleySpencer \n\n>They are different things. Using toys is masturbating, can be done with or without porn, and people aren't generally turned on by toys themselves, they're simply turned on and are using the toy as a means to masturbate, whereas porn is stimuli to be turned on.\n\nthis is it. This is what I mean when I say watching porn is different to using a vibrator. One inherently features \"another woman\" (or whatever twirls your baton), while one is at it's most basic function a physical thing. But, like I said, I also think they both should not matter at all as long as it doesn't interfere with your irl sex life.\n\nI think what I've only recently \"gotten\" is that while I think a vibrator is different because it's literally just physical, porn works for some people in the exact same way and it only 'seems' different because of social crap about being comparable/in competition with other women. So while they both serve the same function, there's a bunch of social crap around porn that affects women in ways that vibrators don't affect dudes as much (I hope this makes sense and can help you gain insight into your partner's perspective, sorry for rambling).\n\nTalk to her about it, she's fishing to see whether you watch porn, maybe she's hoping you'll 'get the message' and just stop. IDK. I think it's fair to assume she knows you watch porn and to me it sounds like she's insecure.
