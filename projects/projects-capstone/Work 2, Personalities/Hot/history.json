While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview that addresses common questions, and included a short list of introductory reading. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony.

While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview that addresses common questions, and included a short list of introductory reading. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

India the modern country is an absurdly diverse state that encompasses hundreds of languages, ethnicities and cultures, there is no such thing as one \"Indian\" culture. I've never heard of the theory that Southeast Asia was \"colonized\" by Indians either.\n\nPapua New Guinea is much further away from Southeast Asia than you think. 3,000km of water separates it from the Straight of Malacca and the most active trade routes of the world. For reference, that's a larger distance than that between Rome and Moscow. Australia is even more isolated, and notoriously inhospitable. You're putting unrealistic expectations on geographical proximity here, by your logic, Iceland should be an industrial powerhouse.\n\nThe focal issue here is that your starting out with the belief that human development is a pre-ordained path, and that's not really true. Farming is difficult in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and so settled societies didn't take off there. Without settled societies, and with such a geographically isolated populations, the people of Papua New Guinea and Australia had relatively little contact with other peoples and thus encountered very little cultural exchange. But they didn't sit on their thumbs, they spent these last 2000 years figuring out how to flourish in very difficult environments, and that's also a strong achievement."], [2, "The Negritos, Melanasians and Australoids were all stone age hunter gatherers originally.\n\nBut the Melanesians in Papua New Guinea independently developed stone age style agriculture and cultivated various crops for food, giving them an advantage over the Aboriginals in Australia and Negritos in the rest of SEA.\n\nThe Austro-Asiatics and Austronesians who expanded south to take their place, were originally stone age farmers. Austronesians had rice agriculture as they expanded in to SEA.\n\nThe Polynesians are a branch of Austronesians that remained in the stone age and practiced agriculture, growing plants like taro, but they never got to the metalworking stage. They expanded into the Pacific.\n\nHowever the Austronesians who remained behind eventually acquired metalworking technology. Some Tai-Kadai or Austroasiatic peoples developed the Dong Son bronze drum culture in mainland SEA which exported those drums around island SEA. \n\nTaiwan Aboriginals, Montagnards, Igorots, Lumads, and Dayaks are examples of Austronesian animist metalworking farmers (although without \"higher\" civilization, like writing, state formation, and \"advanced\" religion such as Hinduism). The next stage after them was acquiring Indic civilization like the Cham, Javanese, Moros, and Malays did.\n\nSo basically Negritos stayed in the hunter gatherer stone age stage, Papuans and Polynesian Austronesians stayed in the agricultural stone age stage, Aboriginals stayed largely hunter gatherer stone age stage although there are signs they engaged in proto agriculture [1](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bushtelegraph/rethinking-indigenous-australia's-agricultural-past/5452454) [2](http://nationalunitygovernment.org/pdf/2014/Evidence_for_Indigenous_Australian_Agriculture.pdf) [3](http://theplanthunter.com.au/culture/dark-emu-book-review/), while most Austronesians moved on to the metalworking stage.\n\nAustralia is believed to have acquired the dingo dog from ancient contact with Austronesians who apparently didn't bother settling the continent.\n\nAustronesian Makassan Muslims traded with Australian Aboriginals in Arnhem land but nothing came of it in terms of state formation among Aboriginals.\n\nNew Zealand Maori Polynesians likely [acquired](http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/01/22/169980441/how-the-sweet-potato-crossed-the-pacific-before-columbus) sweet potatoes from South America before European contact.\n\nAustralian Aboriginals and Papuans have significant amounts of Denisovan DNA."], [1, "[deleted]"], [1, "An important factor for SEA ( and North America/ Sub Sahara Africa)  was their distance from the Silk Road\n\nalot of technologies are not just invented but they are improved generation to generation, building on previous discoveries.

It was the Americans who only brought the Igorot under Philippine government control.\n\nThe Lumads were shielded off from Spanish rule and Hispanicization by terrain and because the Moros were also fighting Spain.\n\nVietnamese Kinh settlers could not penetrate into the Central Highlands until after independence from France. Before that they would die of malaria and other diseases if they tried settling there.\n\nIn New Guinea, Indonesians only traded with the coastal Papuans. The coastal Papuans would in turn trade with the interior highland Papuans but no foreigners would see the highlanders. The Dong Son bronze drum people in northern Vietnam 2,500 years ago exported bronze drums to Java, who in turn exported them to New Guinean coastal people over 2,000 years ago, but no outsider penetrated the interior of New Guinea.\n\nEuropean colonialists did not penetrate into interior New Guinea until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It took the invention of the airplane for them to fly over New Guinea and see the highlander peoples for themselves. European anthropologists were still busy contacting New Guinean highlanders throughout the 20th century. There was major risk of disease when venturing into jungle areas.\n\nBritish colonialists originally only started settling the fertile southeastern part of Australia. They did not penetrate into the desert interior until much later. That is the reason why most of the un-mixed Aboriginals live in the interior desert regions while the ones in the Southeast are mixed with Europeans.\n\nThe Makassan Muslims traded with northern Aboriginals and it wasn't a fertile area so there wasn't any opportunity for them to introduced advanced agriculture and state building. The Austronesians who introduced dingos to Australia likely saw the same unfertile areas so they did not introduce more advance society to the Aboriginals.\n\nInterior Borneo was a jungle. Dayaks traded with outsiders and acquired items like ceramics from China but nobody ventured into the interior.\n\nIn Taiwan, Han people settled on the western plains along the western coast. The Dutch attacked and subjugated the Plains Aboriginals. The Plains Aboriginals came under Dutch, Ming loyalist, and Qing rule.  Koxinga died of malaria on Taiwan after expelling the Dutch.\n\nThe mountain Taiwan Aboriginals in the interior remained out of government control until the Japanese came. The mountain Aboriginals fought against American marines in 1867 Formosa Expedition and against the Japanese in 1874. The mountain Aboriginals were armed with spears, large knives, and matchlock muskets.\n\nThe Japanese had to use machine guns, aircraft, and poison gas bombs to finally conquer the mountain Aboriginal areas in the 1910s-1933.\n\nSouthern China itself was a disease death trap for northerners for a long time. There were Han Kings ruling over states in southern China like Wu, Yue, Minyue, Nanyue, and Dian, but Baiyue people were the majority. Han people mixed with the Baiyue to acquire disease resistant genetics before southern China turned majority Han.\n\nSouthern China and even northern China south of the Great Wall were risky places for Jurchens/Manchus to step into. Manchus would get hit with smallpox in northern China south of the Great Wall and could die of tropical diseases in southern China. Manchus in southern China were limited to urban city Eight Banner garrisons and they did not usually wander into the rural areas. The Manchu Shunzhi Emperor died of smallpox and his son Kangxi was infected with it. Kangxi ordered smallpox inoculation on Manchus."], [1, "This is filled with so much wrong information I don't even know where to begin.\n\nIndians never colonized Southeast Asia. Indian culture simply diffused through trade, not through outright colonization. Furthermore, even before Indian culture diffused throughout the region, there were already well established countries that regularly entered Chinese historical records, such as the Bronze Age kingdom of Van Lang and its successor, the kingdom of Nanyue/Nam Viet.\n\nEven when Indian culture diffused throughout the region, the Southeast Asian nations had their own local innovations in architecture and infrastructure, as exemplified by the achievements of the Khmer Empire. The city of Angkor for example had a highly complex network of canals that allowed for great mobility and irrigation, and it also connected the great architectural landmarks of the city.\n\nSo no, your assertion regarding Southeast Asia is utterly false and misleading and has no basis in fact.

From there, the technology for making bronze drums spread throughout the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan, as well as Vietnam, and it eventually spread to Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), and the islands of Indonesia, from Sumatra to Timur (near Papua New Guinea).\n\nhttp://papuan.linguistics.anu.edu.au/Donohue/downloads/Wright_Denham_Shine_Donohue_2013_WestNewGuinea.pdf\n\n>Further incidental finds included ceramic scatters, stone flake scatters, axes, mortars, pestles, bronze objects and Dong Son drums (discussed belo\n\n>In 1953, small, flat, irregular pieces of metal were observed wrapped in bark or cotton and worn as amulets at Doreri in the Ayamaru district (Elmberg 1959 , pp. 70, 81).

These items  had  been  broken  from  three  flat,  metal  objects  kept  in  different  parts  of  the  clan territory  and locally named bo ri (powerful material)  and bo so  napi (old thing  mother; Elmberg 1959 ).

The Shang dynasty was centered around the Yellow River. The Yue and Wu Kingdom were around the Yangtze near the eastern coast. Bronze working probably spread south from those states during the late Shang and early Zhou.\n\nSanxingdui was the Shu Kingdom. The Shu Prince An Duong Vuong founded Au Lac. The Chu state was originally part of the Zhou dynasty before it broke off as an independent state and a Chu General founded the Dian Kingdom in Yunnan after leading a military expedition there. The Kings of Wu claimed to be descended from a member of the Zhou dynasty royal family who migrated southeast while the Kings of Yue claimed to be descended from a member of the Xia dynasty royal family who migrated southeast. It appears that it was common for Kings from the northern areas to go south and found new Kingdoms among the natives there, possibly spreading new technology like bronze metalworking and the Chinese writing system. It continued with Nanyue being founded by a northern General and later with the Ly, Tran, and Ho dynasties being founded with families originating in China.\n\nhttp://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10963-011-9054-6#page-1\n\n>We challenge this model by presenting a new chronological framework for Ban Chiang, which supports our model that the knowledge of bronze metallurgy reached Southeast Asia only in the late 2nd millennium BC, through contact with the states of the Yellow and Yangtze valleys.", "id": "damxi88"}], [{"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "damdyi5"}, {"comment": "Hi! \n\nIt looks like you are talking about the book *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by *Jared Diamond*.\n\nIt is probably good to know that modern historians and anthropologists are quite critical of, if not borderline/outright hostile to, *Guns, Germs, and Steel*. Put bluntly, historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history that, in the end, paradoxically supports the very racism/Eurocentricism he is attempting to argue against. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [\"just so stories\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.\n\nFirst, **Diamond notoriously cherry-picks data that supports his hypothesis while ignoring the complexity of the issues.**\n\nIn his chapter \"Lethal Gift of Livestock\" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) on his hand-picked All Star team could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. Diamond ignored the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. \n\nAlso, he cherry-picks history when discussing the conquest of the Inca.\n\n> Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.\n\nThis is just patently false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling \"game over.\" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were \"conquered\", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological \"advantage\", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, but Diamond doesn't mention that complexity. The Inka were conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered, and technology reigns supreme in Diamond's narrative. \n\nThis brings us to a second issue: **Diamond uncritically examines the historical record surrounding conquest.** \n\nPizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts, like Diamond seems to do, you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.\n\nFinally, **the construction of the arguments for GG&S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world-wide in general, as categorically inferior**. \n\nTo believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.\n\nInstead of *GG&S* try:\n\n- Restall *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*\n\n- Mann *1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus*\n\n- MacQuarrie *Last Days of the Inca*\n\n- And if you would like to hear more about infectious disease spread after contact...

He is best known by his wartime intelligence codename Intrepid. Many people consider him to be one of the real-life inspirations for James Bond.[2] Ian Fleming himself once wrote, \"James Bond is a highly romanticized version of a true spy. The real thing is ... William Stephenson.\"[3]\nAs head of the British Security Coordination, Stephenson handed over British scientific secrets to Franklin D. Roosevelt and relayed American secrets to Winston Churchill.[4] In addition, Stephenson has been credited with changing American public opinion from an isolationist stance to a supportive tendency regarding America's entry into World War II.[4]\n\n\n\n\n> For his extraordinary service to the war effort, he was made a knight bachelor by King George VI in the 1945 New Year Honours. In recommending Stephenson for the knighthood, Winston Churchill wrote: \"This one is dear to my heart.\"\n\nHe was an adopted boy from a poor immigrant family, but later an amateur boxing champion, WWI pilot ace, POW camp escapee, inventor, millionaire, and a spy that was good friends with two of the biggest leaders in the Allied powers during WWII. He is the reason the OSS and later the CIA were founded, and was the founder of the first spy training school in the western hemisphere. He was an incredible man even outside his longstanding achievments though. He even went beyond that silly one dollar salary, instead taking no salary and directly contributing over a million dollars to the war initiative out of pocket.\n\nHere is a full online version of a book detailing some of the spy games that took place under his leadership during WWII and studded with glowing quotes from many that he influenced\n\n> The late General Bill Donovan, director \nof the Office of Strategic Services, said \nof him; \"Bill Stephenson taught us all we \never knew about foreign intelligence.\" . \n\n\n\nThis is what J. Edgar Hoover had to say to Sir William after the war:\n\n\n>  the F.B.I, chief remarked \nthat in the years to come Stephenson could certainly look back \nwith great satisfaction to the 'very worthy contribution' which \nhe had made not only to his own country but to those of the \nAllies in this world conflict. 'When the full story can be told', \nMr. Hoover added, 'I am quite certain that your contribution \nwill be among the foremost in having brought victory finally to \nthe united nations' cause.' \n\nhttps://archive.org/stream/room363001951mbp/room363001951mbp_djvu.txt", "id": "daq0bsh"}, {"comment": "Thanks for all the replies.

Despite being invaded, slaughtered, and having roughly 30% of their war build-up destroyed during the first few weeks of Operation Barbarossa, the Soviets were outproducing the Nazis by the end of the war with a pretty comfortable margin.  They also managed to create arguably the most capable tank in the war.\n\nHitler's best armies were tied up, and defeated, on Soviet soil.\n\nAlso worth noting that French partisans were instrumental in making the D-Day landings a success by sabotaging communication lines, preventing rapid reinforcements.", "id": "dapsg9y"}], [{"comment": "Did the most is hard as it requires figuring  out what sort of contribution matters most. \n\nI think the contribution of the Polish forces in exile is certainly a large and often overlooked part of the war.

", "id": "daljy6t"}, {"comment": "Hi! \n\nIt looks like you are talking about the book *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by *Jared Diamond*.\n\nIt is probably good to know that modern historians and anthropologists are quite critical of, if not borderline/outright hostile to, *Guns, Germs, and Steel*. Put bluntly, historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history that, in the end, paradoxically supports the very racism/Eurocentricism he is attempting to argue against. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [\"just so stories\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.\n\nFirst, **Diamond notoriously cherry-picks data that supports his hypothesis while ignoring the complexity of the issues.**\n\nIn his chapter \"Lethal Gift of Livestock\" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) on his hand-picked All Star team could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. Diamond ignored the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. \n\nAlso, he cherry-picks history when discussing the conquest of the Inca.\n\n> Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.\n\nThis is just patently false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling \"game over.\" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were \"conquered\", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological \"advantage\", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, but Diamond doesn't mention that complexity. The Inka were conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered, and technology reigns supreme in Diamond's narrative. \n\nThis brings us to a second issue: **Diamond uncritically examines the historical record surrounding conquest.** \n\nPizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts, like Diamond seems to do, you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.\n\nFinally, **the construction of the arguments for GG&S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world-wide in general, as categorically inferior**. \n\nTo believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.\n\nInstead of *GG&S* try:\n\n- Restall *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*\n\n- Mann *1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus*\n\n- MacQuarrie *Last Days of the Inca*\n\n- And if you would like to hear more about infectious disease spread after contact...

The spectacle of former slaves representing the low country rice kingdom or the domain of Natchez cotton nabobs epitomized the political revolution wrought by reconstruction.\"\n\nThe reality is, reconstruction was a big deal. We hear a lot about broken promises of 40 acres and a mule, and I don't think many would argue that reconstruction brought equality. Still, African Americans made a lot of progress during reconstruction. There is no better example of this than former slaves being sworn into government office. By 1901, however, there was no longer any black representation in congress in the south, a sad reality which would persist into the early 1970s. So what happened?\n\nThe short answer is the Great compromise of 1877, which formally ended reconstruction. By this time, there was a depression going on. Northerners were hungry and poor. They didn't want to see money spent on southern reconstruction when they, themselves, were struggling. There was also a lot of cultural backlash against reconstruction.

That's what OP's question is about, and it's a good question because the successes of reconstruction are, far too often, forgotten about.\n\nSo what were those successes? Political offices were a big one. During reconstruction, there was not a single state lacking officials of color. In almost every county with any significant black population, there was black leadership at the local level as well. The office of sheriff was an important one. Mississippi had 15 black sheriffs, and Louisiana had 19. African Americans served on school boards, as tax collectors, and as county supervisors.\n\nYou asked about education. I don't have answers to your specific questions, but it became commonplace for black women to demand the right to attend night school as part of their work arrangements. By 1872, there were 1,500 public schools in Texas. I don't have stats on higher education at hand.\n\nEconomically, things were more bleak. There was an effort to transform the south into a thriving source of capitalist production, with big factories and businesses. This translated into state aid for already entrenched railroad companies. There was also intense corruption during reconstruction, and many in the Republican Party were guilty of this.

Castro was a communist who fought an insurgency prior to his coup, which once completed began purging all opposition, arresting and jailing, toturing and murdering dissidents by the hundreds and thousands. As a communist he then proceeded to steal the property of the wealthy and his opposition while consolidating power, causing many Cubans rich and poor, believers and atheist alike to flee his oppression. Many died at sea drowned while attempting to cross to other carribean and Central American nations, and the United States particularly Florida.\n\nPresident Eisenhower devised a plan to train exiles who had fled Cuba into a military force, which would stage from Guatemala to invade Cuba with American Air and Naval support, however as this was nearing the end of Eisenhowers term the plan was left for the incoming President Kennedy to carry through. Kennedy approved the operation in 1961 which landed 1500 men in the Bay of Pigs in Cuba on April 17, while American bombers attacked Cuban airfields on the first day, however Kennedy later halted the US air and naval support to the anti communist forces, who suddenly found themselves abandoned and outnumbered 1500 to approximately 25000 Cuban communist soldiers and 9000 police with a further ~200000 militiamen. The invasion completely failed as a result and was over two days later.\n\nCastro then used this to boost his support and consolidate power further, coordinating with ally and fellow communists The Soviet Union (USSR) to place nuclear missiles in Cuba, along with Soviet military forces to bolster the Castros military position.

Castro was a communist who fought an insurgency prior to his coup, which once completed began purging all opposition, arresting and jailing, toturing and murdering dissidents by the hundreds and thousands. As a communist he then proceeded to steal the property of the wealthy and his opposition while consolidating power, causing many Cubans rich and poor, believers and atheist alike to flee his oppression. Many died at sea drowned while attempting to cross to other carribean and Central American nations, and the United States particularly Florida.\n\nPresident Eisenhower devised a plan to train exiles who had fled Cuba into a military force, which would stage from Guatemala to invade Cuba with American Air and Naval support, however as this was nearing the end of Eisenhowers term the plan was left for the incoming President Kennedy to carry through. Kennedy approved the operation in 1961 which landed 1500 men in the Bay of Pigs in Cuba on April 17, while American bombers attacked Cuban airfields on the first day, however Kennedy later halted the US air and naval support to the anti communist forces, who suddenly found themselves abandoned and outnumbered 1500 to approximately 25000 Cuban communist soldiers and 9000 police with a further ~200000 militiamen. The invasion completely failed as a result and was over two days later.\n\nCastro then used this to boost his support and consolidate power further, coordinating with ally and fellow communists The Soviet Union (USSR) to place nuclear missiles in Cuba, along with Soviet military forces to bolster the Castros military position. This created the Cuban Missile Crisis because Nuclear Missiles in Cuba,  much closer to the continental US posed a much greater threat to the US while reducing the time in which US nuclear forces could retaliate against both Cuba and the Russians.

The rest of the world even supported Hitler, and claiming to be Germany's anti communist protector was how he managed to gain power in 1933 anyway (Recihstag fire). People like Churchill who saw him for what he was as someone equally dangerous as the communists, were very few and far between.\n\nAnd Castro would obviously oppose South Africa. He was at WAR with South Africa in Angola. If you wish to bring up communist racial criticisms, I am aware of them and by no means am I defending South Africa's racist apartheid regime. I thoroughly believe that actual racism is completely evil, whether it be coming from an apartheid South African, Nazi, southern Democrat (read the Confederate Constitution, article 1 section 9 v4 which bans the liberation of slaves for example), or even if it is a communist.\n\nI'm sure there was nothing in itself racist about the Russian controlled Soviet Union and its genocide via starvation of the Ukrainians, pogroms against Jews, massacres of Poles, Czechs, Liuthanians, etc. after all it's entirely possible that the former province of East Prussia should be entirely vacated of Germans occupied by Russians and renamed Kalingrad with zero racism involved whatsoever, right?\n\nAnd what the communist may lack in racism he certainly substitutes in class hatred. The extermination of the Kulaks being a prime example, or getting back to Cuba and Castro, the seizure of all property of the Cuban elite (and yes there was an elite, yes) and imprisonment, rape, totured and execution of its members along with all dissidents regardless of class or race (though race itself did remain an issue, the lasting legacy of the Spanish racial castes systems)\n\nLook I feel like I've gone all over the place trying to answer you but it simply boils down to the fact that in great power politics nobody's hands are clean, yes a great many terrible actors were supported like those I mentioned earlier or again returning to Cuba the very same Fulgenico Batista that Castro successfully overthrew, in order to halt the advance of communism. But at the same time there is no idolising or eulogising of the communist who were in many instances worse, and statistically speaking affected far far more people.\n\nHistory is brutal, bloody and full of errors, contradictions and hypocrisy.\n\nEdit: except for Hitler.

Rivers rinse salt from rocks and earth and carry it to the\nsea. But when people divert water onto arid land, much of it evaporates and the salt stays behind.\nIrrigation also causes waterlogging, allowing brackish groundwater to seep upward. Unless there is\ngood drainage, long fallowing, and enough rainfall to flush the land, irrigation schemes are future\nsalt pans.\nSouthern Iraq was one of the most inviting areas to begin irrigation, and one of the hardest in\nwhich to sustain it: one of the most seductive traps ever laid by progress. After a few centuries of\nbumper yields, the land began to turn against its tillers. The first sign of trouble was a decline in\nwheat, a crop that behaves like the coalminer \u2019s canary. As time went by, the Sumerians had to replace\nwheat with barley, which has a higher tolerance for salt. By 2500 B.C. wheat was only 15 per cent of\nthe crop, and by 2100 B.C. Ur had given up wheat altogether.\nAs builders of the world\u2019s first great watering schemes, the Sumerians can hardly be blamed for\nfailing to foresee their new technology\u2019s consequences. But political and cultural pressures certainly\nmade matters worse. When populations were smaller, the cities had been able to sidestep the problem\nby lengthening fallow periods, abandoning ruined fields, and bringing new land under production,\nalbeit with rising effort and cost. After the mid-third millennium, there was no new land to be had.\nPopulation was then at a peak, the ruling class top-heavy, and chronic warfare required the support of\nstanding armies \u2014 nearly always a sign, and a cause, of trouble. Like the Easter Islanders, the\nSumerians failed to reform their society to reduce its environmental impact.59 On the contrary, they\ntried to intensify production, especially during the Akkadian empire (c. 2350\u20132150 B.C.) and their\nswan song under the Third Dynasty of Ur, which fell in 2000 B.C.\nThe short-lived Empire of Ur exhibits the same behaviour as we saw on Easter Island: sticking to\nentrenched beliefs and practices, robbing the future to pay the present, spending the last reserves of\nnatural capital on a reckless binge of excessive wealth and glory. Canals were lengthened, fallow\nperiods reduced, population increased, and the economic surplus concentrated on Ur itself to support\ngrandiose building projects. The result was a few generations of prosperity (for the rulers), followed\nby a collapse from which southern Mesopotamia has never recovered.60\nBy 2000 B.C., scribes were reporting that the earth had \u201cturned white.\u201d61 All crops, including\nbarley, were failing. Yields fell to a third of their original levels. The Sumerians\u2019 thousand years in\nthe sun of history came to an end. Political power shifted north to Babylon and Assyria, and much\nlater, under Islam, to Baghdad. Northern Mesopotamia is better drained than the south, but even there\nthe same cycle of degradation would be repeated by empire after empire, down to modern times. No\none, it seems, was willing to learn from the past. Today, fully half of Iraq\u2019s irrigated land is saline \u2014\nthe highest proportion in the world, followed by the other two centres of floodplain civilization,\nEgypt and Pakistan.62\nAs for the ancient cities of Sumer, a few struggled on as villages, but most were utterly abandoned.\nEven after 4,000 years, the land around them remains sour and barren, still white with the dust of\nprogress. The desert in which Ur and Uruk stand is a desert of their making.\"\n\nRonald Wright: [2004 CBC Massey Lectures:](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-2004-cbc-massey-lectures-a-short-history-of-progress-1.2946872) **A Short History of Progress**", "id": "daiaruw"}, {"comment": "Excellent piece.

Ordinarily, military doctrine requires that an attacker needs a superiority of several times the strength of the defender for success to be achievable, but in this case such a margin was unnecessary considering the freedom the Japanese enjoyed in deploying forces and manoeuvring them. The Indian troops were outclassed by the Japanese, and although the Australians, once committed to action in Johore on 14 January, achieved the few allied successes of the campaign (at places such as Gemas, Bakri, Jemaluang and Muar River), the 8th Division was understrength with just two brigades and lost heavily over the course of the next fortnight's fighting.\n\n\n\n\nOnce pushed back into Singapore Island, the odds did not materially move in favour of the British forces.

Japan being both is the only reason it wasn't conquered by outside forces. the ocean and the mountians alone defended Japan from the outside most of the time. \n\nwhen Japan decided to modernize and militarize, they had to be a naval state. they had no choice. this is the same reason the UK became dominant. navy trumps land armies in terms of imperial power. it was the same with the Greeks and Romans. they conquered the sea and it helped everything else fall into place. \n\nit's a huge reason the U.S. invested in the navy, when it became accepted that the navy made powers dominant.

In regards to social structure, Japan was ahead of the curve until WW2, where both men and women had a tradition of attending school and many girls worked jobs until marriage, where they would usually assist with family businesses. \n\nAs well, the Japanese business model of large private and public firms with healthy grants from the government helped fuel economic growth. This was especially important in streamlining economic growth in desirable industries during the 50's and 60's. \n\nProbably the most important thing though that gives success to Japan today is the American leniency post WW2, in retaining the leftover industry and allowing them to retain a dumping economy until the 80's into china and Korea. With the burst of the bubble with the collapse of Asia in the 90's this has begun to change though. \n\nEducation in Japan has always been quite ROTE based, as they took much of their traditional civil exams from China, which was basically memorizing the classics. During the 60's and 70's this was excellent for providing young workers who could quickly adapt to technology and systems, but by the 90's it showed that the lack of creative innovation was beginning to catch up as Japan had reached the forefront of technology.

So from 1868 on, they were adapting the latest and best the rest of the world had to offer, and they were so far away that other countries didn't mind selling them tech. \n\nAfter WW2, the US had a very gentle occupation, helped reform the old society, and also encouraged a re-building of industry to stave off communism, and bought a lot of supplies from Japan during the Korean war, which provided a needed stimulus. \n\nI don't know why you only hear about the bad things, unless you only hear about WW2.

In regards to social structure, Japan was ahead of the curve until WW2, where both men and women had a tradition of attending school and many girls worked jobs until marriage, where they would usually assist with family businesses. \n\nAs well, the Japanese business model of large private and public firms with healthy grants from the government helped fuel economic growth. This was especially important in streamlining economic growth in desirable industries during the 50's and 60's. \n\nProbably the most important thing though that gives success to Japan today is the American leniency post WW2, in retaining the leftover industry and allowing them to retain a dumping economy until the 80's into china and Korea.

Feel free to read up on it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanban_trade\n\n>so by 1867 the government and scholars were able to recognize that modernization was the only way to remain competitive.\n\nWrong again, the government was isolationist, despite many people in Japan with common sense watching Europe slap around China and rightly fearing that the same could happen to Japan. It took a rebellion overthrowing the government to turn Japanese policy upside-down into a very pro-western modernization tilt.\n\n>Japan was ahead of the curve until WW2\n\nWomen being pushed to work in factories is not exactly \"ahead of the curve\". Meiji Japan was highly patriarchal, but female labor was exploited for modernization.\n\n>As well, the Japanese business model of large private and public firms with healthy grants from the government helped fuel economic growth. This was especially important in streamlining economic growth in desirable industries during the 50's and 60's. \n\nCouldn't be more wrong, though it looks like you pasted it from a textbook.\n\n>With the burst of the bubble with the collapse of Asia in the 90's this has begun to change though. \n\nlol that reads like you stole it from a textbook written in 1995. Japan's economy has been in the trash can for the past 20 years.\n\n>Education in Japan has always been quite ROTE based, as they took much of their traditional civil exams from China, which was basically memorizing the classics. During the 60's and 70's this was excellent for providing young workers who could quickly adapt to technology and systems\n\nWhat the hell? Based on China? Did you even go to class? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Empire_of_Japan#Education_policy_during_Meiji_era\n\nJapanese education hasn't followed China ever since the Meiji Restoration. China's old education system would be TERRIBLE for \"workers who could quickly adapt to technology and systems\". \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Japan#Post-WWII\n\n>That's why most Japanese products (besides automobiles) seem a bit pass\u00e9.\n\n**groan**", "id": "dam1sox"}, {"comment": "I think you're misunderstood what I've been taking about.\n\nWhen I talked about adapting the most modern technologies from china and Korea, I was referring to  the origin of the Yamato people colonizing Japan in around the 4th century, and up until the 16th they received most of their technological advances like irrigation techniques from the mainland, and with contact with Europeans that shifted. So my point is that Japan has a history of adapting technologies from other nations, and them streamlining them to best fit their purposes.\n\nSecondly, yes Japan was \"isolationist\", but not to the point of ignorance. There were trips of Japanese (Iwakura mission) which were funded by the Tokugawa, as well as western daimyo funding their own trips secretly. The Boshin was relatively tame for a nation that built itself on the military class, and you could say any daimyo that didn't have his head buried in the sand could realize that Japan needed to change. Just look at the bombardment of Satsuma, and the arrival of commodore perry. As well, at the time the Japanese still traded with China, you think they didn't know about the opium wars? And just as you were saying with nanban trade, the Dutch offered many words of advice to the Japanese to get with the picture or thrown under the bus like china with unequal treaties.\n\nI just want to say that with victories in the Sino-Japanese, Russo-Japanese, and relative success in the opening months of the pacific war, it's difficult to say they weren't on par with other world powers. At the end of the day they were hampered by industrial output and such factionalized army, government, and navy that it was like a 3 headed dog each with a different goal in mind, so it would remain almost impossible to achieve anything by 1941.\n\nNowhere did I talk about the exploitation of women, but what nation didn't exploit women during their industrial revolution? Look at the children who worked in mines in Britain, and the use of immigrants in America for their factories. You could say that the relative conditions in Japan were much better than any other nations for the rate at which they developed (an amazing overturn of their economy in less than 75 years). That's why no one even predicted that it would be possible for them to win 2 wars against perceived world powers (although, I will admit china and Russia were more like sad 2nd rates by 1895).\n\nFor the growing economy, you should read up on the Ministry of international trade and industry, preferably not on Wikipedia for anything. I can provide you a good book that also reads into pre-ww2 Japan and the sources of the Japanese economic miracle.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean about the textbook pasting, do you not believe they're in a recession? It's hard to discuss if you don't provide a counterpoint. 2016-1990 is 26 years, and I said their bubble economy popped in the 90's, so we're on the same page it looks like to me...\n\nIf there's something else besides Wikipedia I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nAlso, do you have any knowledge of the Japanese education system? There's a reason they score top 3 on math and science, but are last in east Asia when it comes to English. As well, I recently had a guest lecture from a professor who does research at Kyoto Imperial College talk about the issues with Japan's education and how it needs to adapt to provide more independent thought.\n\nIf you're going to groan and moan, then please don't keep it to yourself. Would you just have it so we groan at each other continuously?", "id": "damfhmp"}, {"comment": "> I was referring to the origin of the Yamato people colonizing Japan in around the 4th century\n\nNot relevant. The relevant facts are that, when faced with European contact, Japan (eventually) embraced westernization, while China stubbornly refused to admit western superiority out of arrogance and pride. As a result, Japan far surpassed China in strength.\n\n>Secondly, yes Japan was \"isolationist\", but not to the point of ignorance.\n\nYou said the Japanese government pushed modernization. It didn't. The Tokugawa was ignorant like the Chinese. \n\nModernization only happened because a rebellion overthrew the government and forced change. The Japanese who had common sense had already been calling for westernization DECADES before 1867. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boshin_War\n\n>There were trips of Japanese (Iwakura mission) which were funded by the Tokugawa\n\nIwakura mission was 1871. Tokugawa was gone as of 1867. Iwakura was so significant because it was part of the radical change in direction for the new government away from Tokugawa policies.\n\n>as well as western daimyo\n\naka the guys who overthrew the Tokugawa.\n\n> The Boshin was relatively tame for a nation that built itself on the military class, and you could say any daimyo that didn't have his head buried in the sand could realize that Japan needed to change.\n\nNo you couldn't say that. If you could say that, they wouldn't have needed a war. The new Tokugawa \"woke up\" in 1866 but it was too little, too late. The Boshin War was limited in size because the Tokugawa was weak by then and it was just inter-clan warfare. The real battles had already been decided before then, like in 1866 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Ch%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB_expedition \n\n> it's difficult to say they weren't on par with other world powers.\n\nJapan was a regional power, not a world power. They were stronger than other asian countries, but they were nowhere close to world powers like the United States. WW2 provided a good illustration of that, with the US absolutely demolishing Japan one-handed despite most of its focus being Europe.\n\n> so it would remain almost impossible to achieve anything by 1941.\n\nThey had problems because they got stomped by the USSR at khalkhin gol, and they couldn't finish off China. Running into difficulty in those areas, they shifted to easy prey in the Pacific, and managed to commit seppuku by picking a fight with the US.\n\n>but what nation didn't exploit women during their industrial revolution?\n\nSo you admit that Japan was not somehow enlightened, and your original point was wrong.\n\n>you should read up on\n\nhahahah, yeah. *I* am not the one who needs to do the reading here.\n\n>  preferably not on Wikipedia for anything.\n\nWiki is light years ahead of where you're at when it comes to knowledge of the subject matter. You are nowhere near the point where Wiki stops being the dominant information source. You can't even walk, and looking down on Wiki is for olympic sprinters.\n\n>2016-1990 is 26 years\n\nYou don't say \"this has begun to change\" when talking about stuff from 26 years ago, that is more than your whole lifetime, hence why it looks copy/pasted from an old source.\n\n>but are last in east Asia when it comes to English.\n\nWhat are you smoking? Japan is one of the highest in English language skills, if not #1. The only country around there which I would say beats Japan is the Philippines, and that isn't even an east asian country. I'm not saying the Japanese are GOOD at english, but most other countries do not even try. Japan at least includes english in compulsory education. So you are way off base.\n\n>I recently had a guest lecture from a professor who does research at Kyoto Imperial College talk about the issues with Japan's education and how it needs to adapt to provide more independent thought.\n\nOne guy's opinion.

Otherwise the point you argue is in line with what I've been stating this whole time.\n\nThe Meiji government pushed industrialization through heavy lending and via process of starting their own businesses, then selling them off to private corporations, helping create what we understand as Zaibatsus today. Again, your point is not really in conflict with mine, so I don't understand your argument.\n\nIf you infer into my words, then yes the ones who overthrew the shogunate.\n\nThe second Choshu expedition can be considered the beginning of the Boshin War, as by then many pro-imperial daimyo outright refused to provide troops to the Shogunate, and all fighting was limited between only the harcore loyalists who fought on principle and to defend their way of life, with their whole class being given to them after Sekigahara by Ieyasu due to patronage.\n\nI would say that Japan was miles ahead of any other Asian nation at the time, and only followed the major European states + the USA. At a time when tensions were increasing in Europe, by 1905 most colonial powers were less concerned with Asia.\n\nThe concept of Japan going to war in the Pacific due to it being an easy target is a common misconception. Due to factionalization, the army had obtained complete control over the government, and therefore were able to implement any policy. With the failures on the mainland, the navy was pressed to launch an attack to better position themselves in hopes of negotiating a peace with China. Chiang-Kai-Shek (CKS) knew this, and by 1941 would never agree to terms with Japan. Even in Yamamoto's personal diary, he notes that victory against the USA is impossible, he himself understood the industrial capacity of them after serving as an attache in with them. The only goals of the IJN was to create a buffer zone within 6 months, and hold off the Allied forces to potentially improve their bargaining position. We know that their plans went even better than expected until Midway, and its still debated whether their position could be improved any more. As well, a intercommunicated order from FDR to limit Japan's oil to civilian purposes only became completely embargo the Japanese economy. With this, the IJN only had reserves left for a few months of full operational capacity, or a few years of standby. By not fighting, they were committing themselves to a economic defeat without ever utilizing their navy.\n\nAll Khalkin Gol did was reinforce the army's idea that the only way for them to achieve success was in the South. Even with a victory in Khalkin Gol, it would not have had any real change in the outcome of the Pacific War.\n\nWhere did I ever state that Japan has been enlightened? The only period in history where Japan was at the forefront of the technological advancement was naval and naval aviation technology before WW2, and during the peak of their economic growth into the 70s. \n\nThe fact that you accuse me of being ignorant due to my age only shows your own incompetence. There are reasons that no scholar of any repute would never use Wikipedia to cite the facts. To say that I need to read up on more sources means that anyone receiving an education focused on History, especially when my specialization is on Japanese post 1600 history is utterly ridiculous. Are you trying to say that all one needs to do is read on Wikipedia to become an acclaimed scholar? If so, why is history even taught at schools. To say that my education isn't sufficient in providing proper knowledge on the subject is to insult one of the best schools in the world. You can look up the University of British Columbia's ranking in the world, and tell me that none of their programs are comprehensive enough to warrant studying.\n\nHere is a link to the latest TOEFL results. As you can see, Japan ranks in the bottom 10, behind India, the Philippines, Korea, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

Your insistence over the absolute correctness with Wikipedia would make you a laughing stock within the academic community I hope you realize?\n\nEdit: To add onto the Sino-Japanese War, the goal of the Japanese was to never conquer all of China at the beginning, the military understood it was logistically unfeasible.

The colonial powers other than the US were very easy targets sitting on some very valuable resources. \n\n>All Khalkin Gol did was reinforce the army's idea that the only way for them to achieve success was in the South.\n\nNo, Khalkin Gol broke the back of the Army's political power and any hope for the \"Northern expansion\" faction, in favor of the Navy, which wanted to expand into european colonial territory.\n\n>The only goals of the IJN was to create a buffer zone within 6 months, and hold off the Allied forces to potentially improve their bargaining position.\n\nNope, outside of a few smart people like Yamamoto, most of the Japanese leadership thought that Japan could beat the United States. They were confident because (1) they have a hubristic belief in their own superiority and destiny, and (2) they thought that, as a democracy, the US was weak and would back down after a few defeats. This is a common misconception that most of America's enemies tend to have about us. Lots of people in China still believe it. This is the \"paper tiger\" idea. \n\nJapan actually had a plan to beat the US fleet by launching night attacks and relying in massive torpedo barrages to inflict heavily losses on US ships as the US fleet sailed to support the Philippines. It was a bad strategy, and it didn't work.\n\n>We know that their plans went even better than expected until Midway, and its still debated whether their position could be improved any more.\n\nThe heart of Japan's revised plan once they realized that they couldn't rely on repeating a Battle of Tsushima, was to simply expand as much as possible and dig in as much as possible, to make rooting them out costly enough that the Allies would succumb to war weariness and come to terms. It was the best Japan could hope for, but it was wrong. The US was not the paper tiger that some in the Japanese leadership thought.\n\n>By not fighting, they were committing themselves to a economic defeat without ever utilizing their navy.\n\nJapan didn't get slapped with the embargo until they broke a promise to the Allies to not occupy southern indochina. By then, Japan had already committed to the southern strategy. It is a common misconception that the embargo caused Pearl Harbor. It didn't. \n\n>There are reasons that no scholar of any repute would never use Wikipedia to cite the facts.\n\nWiki is a very useful internet resource to use to cite uncontroversial facts.

You keep trying to pull rank and act like you are a scholar and such, which is why I already told you that on Reddit, your education is really nothing special. A lot of people on reddit have degrees. I actually have post-graduate degrees. Does that mean that you automatically lose in everything you say because I out-rank you? Because that is the game you are playing. It is a double edged sword. If you want to look down on people, remember that most of us are a lot higher than you and could look down on you just as easily.\n\nAlso, we both know you didn't know most of this when you wrote your first post. Your argument with me spurred you to go out and read up on the subject matter. Good. I'm glad you learned something.\n\nAny professor will tell you that getting a BA in History is only the first step. It does not make you an expert on anything. It is just a _basic_ education. It isn't like you have a doctorate and your dissertation was on Meiji Japan.\n\n>Here is a link to the latest TOEFL results.\n\nYou said that the Japanese people \"are last in east Asia when it comes to English.\" Only a tiny fraction of each country bothers to ever take a TOEFL exam. The average Japanese person has had years of education in English. The vast majority of people in other east asian countries have had 0. That fact alone makes Japan #1 by far. In my personal experience, the Philippines does a better job with english, but Korea? China? Vietnam? don't make me laugh. \n\nYou can't compare the top 0.1% of other countries, to the bulk of the Japanese population. You have to compare median to median. The median Japanese would know english to some degree. Probably well over 90% of those other countries wouldn't know any english at all. \n\nHere is a more in depth rebuttal to the notion that TOEFL means anything: hint - it doesn't. http://jalt-publications.org/old_tlt/articles/2000/05/reedy\n\n>Your insistence over the absolute correctness with Wikipedia would make you a laughing stock within the academic community I hope you realize?\n\nI could TA your classes without breaking a sweat.

All these are prioritizing cheapness over speed btw, departing in the summer, and on roads we will be using wagons to haul, like Oregon Trail but with less dysentery. \n\nFrom Ephesus (near modern Sel\u00e7uk) to Antiochia (Antakya) it would cost 1.3 denarii/kg of grain by sea (including the short overland haul from Antiochia's port town) versus 37.5/kg overland. These two routes are within 20 km of being the same distance, but it is massively more expensive overland, well over 20x more expensive. Let's try for some more data points, and let's make these geographically varied.\n\nFrom Londinium (London) to Luguvalium (Carlisle), it's 1.1/kg versus 15/kg, despite the sea route being almost 1000km longer. From Carthago (Tunis) to Iol Caesarea (Cherchell) it's .6/kg versus 30.5/kg; these routes are exactly 20km from being equidistant. From Altinum (near modern Treviso) to Tarentum (Taranto) it's .8/kg versus 31.8/kg, despite the land route being 100km shorter. From Athens to Thessalonica it's .5/kg versus 16.8/kg; the land route is 60km shorter. From Barcino (Barcelona) to Olissipo (Lisbon) it's 1.4/kg versus 42.6/kg, with the overland being just about 500km shorter. Namnetum (Nantes) to Burdigala (Bordeaux) is .2/kg versus 10.7/kg, with the scenic route through lovely Gaul being 111km shorter.\n\nI might have got a little carried away here. That was fun!

"], [1, "Several reasons which were NOT racial hatred:\n\n1.  Many Japanese-Americans were coastal fishermen, and the communities were centered around US naval bases.  It's not that the community at large was a threat, but the Imperial Japanese could send spies and saboteurs who could hide in plain sight.  It was NOT known at the time, but [Takeo Yoshikawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeo_Yoshikawa) seems to be entirely responsible for facilitating Pearl Harbor.  He was a spy with fake credentials who walked around taking copious notes all over the base, air defenses, berthing schedules, manpower, maps, target lists.  Now he decided the local Japanese-American community would NOT help him, but he didn't need it, he could just walk around in the area without being questioned.  IMHO the decision to attack Pearl Harbor would never have happened at all without those intel gems.  He was even picked up AFTER the attack but they couldn't conclude he was a spy and let go.  \n\n2.  The US feared reprisal attacks by their own citizens against the Japanese-Americans, and they'd likely be forced to *protect* the Japanese-Americans and start arresting non-Japanese Americans and our own overzealous servicemen, which would likely come at a huge cost to morale.  The war ran on morale.  Consider the [Zoot Suit Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoot_Suit_Riots)- we weren't at war with Mexico or anything, but they attacked the Hispanic community for partying and NOT being loyal and joining the military.  Now imagine what they'd do when public outcry directed towards Japanese-Americans- which seems inevitable.\n\nInitially the US govt tried to just set  up an exclusion zone around US bases, but it didn't seem to work.  MOST of the Japanese-American community lived there and their livelihoods (fishing) AND sense of community required that area.  Problem is, you can't just say \"move into Arizona, or Kansas, etc\".  There'd be thousands of homeless, jobless ethnic Japanese who'd lost their community.  They would NOT be welcomed anywhere else, they'd be setting up shantytowns, and in a short time you could expect locals to physically attack them.   \n\n"], [-1, "Fear of espionage from the Japanese military.

Ringle, who specialized in Japanese relations. He makes three major points:\n\n>      The majority of Japanese-Americans were uninvolved and uninterested any seditious activity.\n\n>      The small number of extremists within the Japanese-American community were well-known to Navy officials, and largely already taken into custody.\n\n>      The seditious elements of the Japanese-American community were not any different from that of the German, Italian, or Communistic (lol), communities.\n\n>German-Americans and Italian-Americans were not interned as a group, of course.

Where did you ever get that idea in your head? There was a hysterical reaction to the Civil Rights Movement, and that was rightfully pushed aside by the American government in the interest of furthering a just and moral America. Your image of government is whelpishly subservient to public imagination, this is not reality and has never been reality. Popular movements are routinely suppressed and de-legitimized by governments, as the French Revolution, Abolition, or the American Revolution were, for the purposes of maintaining control. \n\nYour mention of the American Nazi party is irrelevant. The German-American Bund had roughly 25,000 members, and was scattered in 1939-1940 through conventional means, with no mass internments undertaken. The government simply investigated the ringleaders and took them into custody, denounced their activities, and reduced the organization into irrelevance. How easy this would have been for the much smaller societies of Imperial Japanese sympathy?

Civilian spies in the US were therefore useless to Germany and Italy as, outside of their capability for minor sabotage, they had access to no beneficial information (military plans, etc.).\n\nContrast this now with the pacific theater: the Japanese had already taken US territory in the Aleutian islands, attacked a refinery in Santa Barbara on the mainland US, and firebombed Oregon forests,  all of which made the possibility of a Japanese west coast invasion very real. In the case if an invasion, civilian spies become very valuable: they can give real-time information on the positioning of troops, they can give the locations of important infrastructure, and they can organize supplies for the invading troops. \n\nDue to the fact that the Japanese were (seemingly) in a position to invade, the US government was now tasked with ensuring that no enemy operatives could endanger the public safety or compromise national security. There were two ways it could do this: first, it could interview/interrogate/investigate every single person of Japanese descent in the nation. Obviously, this presented a logistical nightmare and left significant room for error - error which could lead to a disastrous outcome in the case of an actual invasion. The second possible course of action was to simply intern every Japanese man, woman, and child on the West Coast in a temporary camp, without exceptions. This was significantly easier logistically, and left no room for error. Thus, it is obvious why the US chose the course it did.\n\nThe handling of the internment camps is another matter entirely: depending on the organization in charge of the camp, healthcare was insufficient, food was terrible and often lacking, water wasn't potable, and many of those interned had their property confiscated without ever seeing it returned, destroying lives and livelihoods. All in all, one of the USA's darkest moments in history.\n\nHowever, the evidence seems to show that the reason the Japanese were interned while the Germans and Italians weren't was not due to racism (as it is so tempting to assume) but rather due to the strategic differences present between the Atlantic theater and the Pacific theater.

While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview that addresses common questions, and included a short list of introductory reading. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview that addresses common questions, and included a short list of introductory reading. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

It was one of several \"Ordeals\" that one could go through in lieu of trial to prove innocence, the thinking being of course that one in the right would win with God's guidance. Obviously there was a great defect here to more modern eyes, since the winner often was the better fighter, but this was a criticism even then. Incidents where the weaker man clearly won, for this reason, were especially noted. One famous example in the 9th century was between Gontran, a cousin of the Count of Gastonois and a young man named Ingelger. The Count had died, and Gontran accused the man's wife of the murder. Ingelger pleaded to be allowed to stand as the lady's champion (he was her godson), and triumphed in the fight, beheading his felled adversary, and being presented with a great deal of land by the Countess.\n\nAlthough in the early Middle Ages, there was at least some support from the Church, it quickly soured, and we see a number of laws and edicts that sought to limit or stamp it out, and in 1215, priests were prohibited from being involved in any way, making the trial by combat an essentially secular proceeding. It survived for several more centuries however, but slowly began to die off *as an explicit replacement for trial*. One of the last true judicial duels was that between Jean de Carogne and Jacques le Gris, the latter having been accused by the former's wife of rape. Carogne would defeat the accused - favorite of the King - in combat before the court and many notable dignitaries. Fought in 1387, this was the last judicial duel in France to be sanctioned by the Parliament of Paris, and the controversy and distaste that it brought for many no doubt played a part in the demise there. Several more would occur over the next century or so in the distant parts of France, but further requests were denied by Parliament, losing the institution much of its standing.\n\nAllegedly fought around 1400, one of those unsanctioned trials is perhaps is one of the most interesting trials by combat to ever occur, being between a man and a dog. Aubry de Montdidier was murdered with no witnesses except his dog, who stayed by the body for several days until the poor greyhound was too hungry, so set off to find food. A friend of his master found the dog, who then led him to his poor master's body. Some time later, upon seeing the Chevalier Maquer, who was known to have no love for Montdidier, the dog became vicious and had to be restrained. This was taken as an accusation, and trial by combat arranged between the alleged murder and his canine accuser. Just how the duel proceded is unclear as several, varied accounts exist regarding this episode, either Maquer was buried waist deep with shield and stick, or else he was given a lance, but regardless, he couldn't fed off the dog, which set upon him with such viciousness that he soon begged for mercy and confessed, following which he was hanged.\n\nAs I said though, the explicit replacement of trial with the adjudication of a criminal proceeding by feat of arms was fast dying out by the late 14th century, even if it would continue for some time. There is a shifting which is seen in the late medieval/early modern period from there to the duel of honor, which is well illustrated by the 1547 duel between the Baron of Jarnac, a minor lord with low standing, and La Ch\u00e2taigneraye, a favorite of the Dauphin, combining aspects of the trial by combat in its official sanction by the crown, as well as the duel of honor, being that the underpinning affront was simply a matter of defamation and the combat \"asked for\" by giving the lie.\n\nAt court one day, the Dauphin declared that Jarnac was a \"kept man\" by his step-mother, explicitly stating he was living off the woman's dime, and of course implying he was sleeping with her as well. His honor impugned, Jarnac had no recourse but to give the lie, but could not do so to the future King. La Ch\u00e2taigneraye stepped in as champion, and stated that he had given the information to the Dauphin, having been told by Jarnac himself. Combat was requested of the King, Francois I, but refused, and instead only a court proceeding for defamation could continue. That is, until Francois I died a year later and the Dauphin assumed the throne as Henri II. La Ch\u00e2taigneraye requested combat again, and it was granted. \n\nContrary to all expectations, however, La Ch\u00e2taigneraye was defeated, despite being considered one of the best swordsmen in the country.

They came to the conclusion whichever side had the most automatic firearms had a decisive advantage and that most modern infantry combat took place at around the 200-300 meter range. The effective range of the .30 cal. M1 Garand is something like double that, so in effect, the .30 cartridge was unnecessarily powerful. Therefore, an cartridge that was an intermediate between pistol cartridges and rifle cartridges was seen as ideal. It could be used for automatic fire with controllable recoil and still reach the 300 meter range (unlike pistol-cartridge submachine guns). The Germans came to a similar conclusion during the war, introducing the StG 44 rifle with an intermediate cartridge. The British also wanted to introduce a intermediate cartridge after the war.\n\nNow, introduction of an intermediate cartridge was derailed in the West by the US decision to try and keep a powerful rifle cartridge as the standard rifle cartridge. They reasoned that the M1 Garand had been so successful in the war that a \"full power\" cartridge should be kept. They introduced the 7.62 mm Nato for this purpose. It was a bit shorter than the .30-06 Springfield used in the Garand, but about as powerful. With the new M14 rifle, they attempted to introduce full automatic capability in their standard service rifle. In Vietnam however, the M14 proved incapable of accurate automatic fire due to the heavy recoil so most of them were permanently set to semi-automatic fire. It also fared poorly against the Soviet-made, intermediate cartridge AK-47 used by the VC & NVA in Vietnam. \n\nAt this point the proponents of the intermediate cartridge managed to get the AR-15 into testing in Vietnam. The AR-15 (later the M16 in US service) fired an even smaller caliber bullet (5.56 mm) but compensated by having an increased velocity (a so called small caliber, high velocity cartridge). The US soldier could carry more ammunition in the field with the same amount of weight carried, and could therefore fight longer than his opponent. A switch to the M16 in Vietnam was implemented following glowing reports of the AR-15s success, and despite a shorter period of malfunctions, the M16 proved to be successful on the field of battle. The US then pushed for NATO to switch to the 5.56 mm as the standard rifle cartridge (much to the chagrin of the British, who had pushed for an intermediate cartridge of their own earlier). The Soviet Union and China followed suit with 5.45 and 5.8 mm rifle cartridges of their own, so they seem to have come to the same conclusion as the US. \n\nThe 7.62 mm Nato was retained mostly in machine guns, where the recoil was less of a factor, and increased range was desirable. Of course it complicates logistics, but so does also having the .50 BMG, but they are tools that are needed for specific tasks.", "id": "daqta59"}], [{"comment": "How did the old time east Tennessee gunmakers of Buffalo Valley & Greasy Cove (Unicoi county) market their wares, and what was the most common style of rifle produced?\n\n[Typical east TN rifle, example](http://i.imgur.com/vYWFmjd.jpg)\n\n(I'm just being a smartass...).", "id": "daqi9ly"}]]], "5en4vs": ["The Hittite Empire: A Documentary (Warning: Very Long!)", "2016-11-24 13:25:32", 35, "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDrmsEueb-Q", [[3, "I watched this documentary a while ago, and liked it a lot.

There were many naval skirmishes and battles between the two nations before the revolution.  Because of this, the 13 colonies depended on Great Britain's military might to protect them from the French and Indian invaders. \n\nAfter the British won the Seven Years War many of the soldiers were given land grants in the conquered lands and chose to settle here. Some American profiteers came North  with plans of claiming land and riches from the conquered people which caused extreme agitation among the French.  The British, not wanting another war, passed the Qu\u00e9bec act which protected the French culture, laws and possessions and guaranteed them these rights by giving them a larger proportion of representation in the Government. The British also made peace with the Indians and King George issued his Royal Proclamation of 1763 which recognized that the natives owned all of the lands in North America that hadn't been ceded or purchased. (This document helped create some of the problems in the Mississippi valley that helped fuel the War of 1812). In general Canada was at peace after the end of the Seven Years War. \n\nSouth of the border was a different story.  Americans had been living in their homes for over a hundred years and some were not all that happy with their British rulers. But previously they were dependant on the British for protection against the French and Indian invaders.  After the war was over the British felt that their colony should bear some of the costs of defending their colony and increased taxes. The British handled the tax increase poorly and when the Americans refused to pay them they used their soldiers as tax collectors. Other grievances arose, tensions grew and the Revolution followed. \n\nSo a short answer to your question is that most of the Canadians were happy with their British rulers and most of the American were not. \n\nNot all of the Americans were in favour of revolting. One famous American who initially opposed it was George Washington. The Revolution leaders hoped that the French in Qu\u00e9bec would want to be rid of their British rulers. They sent an emissary there to try to persuade them to join the fight but he was rebuked. \n\n\n\nAn interesting side note is that The Iroquois Confederacy did not want to have one country dominant in North America. Theyfelt that it was in their best interest to keep the two nations fighting each other so before the Seven Years War they would alternate their allegences between the two sides and plan raids designed to keep the two countries at each other's throats. Some of the early historians, as in the one who wrote my grandmothers history text back in 1906, felt that it was the threats posed by the Iroquois that helped prompt King George's Royal Proclamation.

Also, the concerns were different across cultures. I can speak of this in regards to the Near East and in regards to Greco-Roman culture. \n\nIn ancient Israel purity was a **ritual** concern. What I mean by this is that ancient Israelites were worried that if they had an impurity in their midst that their prayer would not have been received or answered by the deity. This could, as they perceived/explained it, influence rain, their success in battle, their reproduction, and their ability to remain independent. For instance, the Kingdom of Judah explained the Kingdom of Israel's loss to the assyrians a result of their impurity caused by idol worship (specifically the worship of Ba'al). To bring this back to female purity and impurity, the ancient Israelites perceived female bleeding a cause of impurity, and thus they had to wait a certain length of time after the bleeding stopped to have sex with their wives. It is possible that this is why it was prioritized to find a virgin wife, because she had not yet bled as a result penetration, thus causing her to be impure. However, it is also important to note that to an extent they allowed remarriage of widows, and not being a virgin was not a cause of death. So the when in this case could possibly be as early as the 13th century BCE or as late as the 6th century BCE.\n\nI'm pretty sure our evidence in Greece primarily comes from the Classical Period (starting roughly in the 6th Century CE), and from Greek mythology prior to that. Greece was an interesting case. They very much believed in women as property and believed in domination and subjugation, as a result they wanted to have complete control over their wives so perhaps this might be why they valued virginity. More importantly, however, many sources hilariously show that there was a concern that a child would not *look* like their father, and the assumption would be made that the child was not his. This would cause shame for the married man in society (remember, he did not dominate his wife). Even during homosexual intercourse (which was widely practiced), the act itself was not frowned upon (sex between two men), but rather \"taking it,\" rather than \"giving it,\" was seen as the role of the lesser person. Greek teachers would commonly dominate their pupils. So a man would want to be the first to dominate his wife, and want to be sure the child was his. \n\nAlso, in both of these cultures there were laws concerning inheritance. This is evident even in the biblical story of Isaac and Ishmael, as well as Jacob and Esau. The primary issue addressed was inheritence of the covenant made with God. Neither of these specifically address issues of purity, but do show the importance of inheritance. A very important part of the covenant was Abraham's land in Canaan. A man would want his belongings to go from him to his son. Blood lines were the only ways of showing familial relations. There was no concept of \"like a son to me.\" The only way to establish familial ties were through blood (or marriage). So to continue his familial success, a father would want his belongings to go to *his* sons. So again, it's easy to fit a virgin wife into this schema. Being a virgin would ensure her sons were also his sons. Family was extremely important in this society for survival. \n\nEdit: This is my first time posting here. I wrote this answer as a historian/scholar of religion. I'm not necessarily writing to assume the philosophy or psychology behind any of this.

At its core is disease prevention, and other family or hereditary issues merely compound virgin status.\n \nSimilarly, it's easy to imagine many reasons why the double standard developed.  Those same family laws and customs made it easier for a man to get away with fornication than a woman.  Bottom line: men don't get pregnant. \n \nBut you're not going to find one answer.

"], [5, "One thing to keep in mind is that a hatred of women (you're marrying, involved with, etc) having sex with other men is explicitly natural in men. \n\nPhysical infidelity of women directly leads to the man's failure to reproduce (ya only get one every 9 months, and if its not yours...), and it was therefore selected against by evolution. The same is not true in the reverse- physical infidelity in men has no bearing on a woman's ability to reproduce. Thus, the birth of the double standard. (interesting side note: fear/hatred of emotional infidelity was selected for in women the same reason- men's love attaches them to the women and leads them to provide/protect/support)\n\nAnother thing is that societies are largely patriarchal and seemingly always have been. If this is a natural feeling among men, and men run/ran society, we can see how it would become such a massive, cross cultural phenomenon."], [1, "For lots of animals, male 'ownership' of offspring is an important motivator in their being willing to protect females and children when they are in a vulnerable state.\n\nWith  humans, one can also physically identify a female virgin (although hymens can break on 'their own', this is the marker that's always used) whereas male virginity cannot be physically detected."], [2, "It wasn't a social construct nor was it oppressive. Much of it was natural, based on natural biological urges and drives of reproduction, monogamy, and family. Watch Little House on the Prarie and you might see and understand what went on in the minds  and communities of the past, and is still something to be obtained today. Love and honor is hard. It's actually much easier to embrace debauchery.\nPurity of women was important because of the tribal and family customs. In hunting/gathering societies it wasn't good for a woman to be impregnated by a man who would not devote his life to her. A woman with a child and no man to hunt, gather, and build a family with was a burden to the tribe or community because other men would have to work extra hard to support a child who wasn't theirs. Also, a woman with a child couldn't work a lot. She had to devote 24 hours a day to the child. Thousands of years ago tribes understood how important monogamy was, and how important it was that a woman should not take chances with sex and be impregnated without a committed man. Women also understood this very well. It was something that people understood without having to be told. \nMen and women also have a very strong urge to meet a lifelong mate. No one had to teach me about love, it just was. It was something that I experienced the first time I fell in love and realized that my woman was all that mattered to me, and she felt the same way toward me. This strong biological urge doesn't have to be taught, but we do celebrate it, or rather we used to.\nThis push to sexualize women is not a highly intellectual thing, nor does it lead to her happiness. Sex is quick, maybe 30 minutes if the man doesn't pull a wam,bam, thankyou maam. The repercussions of this free sex is unwanted pregnancy, STDs, and disappointment because sex without commitment is a 30 minute deal, stacked up against thousands of hours in a year. And no, men didn't get to screw a lot of women. Powerful men used force to gather harems, but it wasn't a good thing for the men who found a shortage of women, and the women who found themselves imprisoned in a breeding farm. Harems also led to worse things, mainly that of the ruler cutting the dicks off of thousands of men so that there wouldn't be any chance of the women in the harem finding love. She was in a breeding farm, dude. There was very little romance involved in this. Women competed for the ruler, and fought each other, not for love, because there wasn't any love involved, but rather for power within the kingdom of the ruler. Harems used sex to get stuff, and to get power. In the end, when they got past the flower of their youth, they were turned out to pasture just like cattle, when the ruler no longer thought they were pretty enough to screw.\nMy friend, monogamy, purity, and sexual union in marriage is a higher ideal, not a lower ideal. It shouldn't be frowned on nor marginalized. Those nations that marginalize marriage, purity, and monogamy will not thrive. They are opening a can or worms  for cultural destruction because it is love that makes the world go round, not cheap sex.

", "id": "dai4hfh"}, {"comment": "I'd be interested to hear your views on the historical accuracy in the Red Tent novel by Anita Diamant.  The author proposed that Dinah's mother and aunts ritually broke her hymen by using a statuette of a household god during her menarche, in total contrast to her cousin saving her \"seal\" for a wedding night.  I haven't gotten around to reading up more but I assume this wasn't completely invented.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Tent", "id": "dajdirj"}, {"comment": "I definitely want to read this, if only to see how Anita Diamant is using the biblical material. I want to say two things. While I agree with giving a voice to otherwise silent figures in the biblical material, a historical or religious studies material would either look at actual, immediate contextual material or look at what the biblical material actually says on its own terms. Neither of these approaches allow scholars to safely agree with Diamant completely. We have no idea what Dinah would have thought, ever. Women's thoughts were almost never recorded. Modern attempts to figure this are largely speculative. Still, though, I'd love to see Diamat's interpretation of the account. Not that there's anything wrong with her approach, but it is significant that she is a novelist and not a historian, so her approach is certainly different. I think it also significant to point out that just like she is interpreting scripture, historical figures have often interpreted the biblical material in different ways. \n\nWith all that said, I can give one possibility of how this material would have been read by the actual Ancient Israelites who wrote it. There is a lot of significant history that I'm going to leave out, but here a quick and dirty version:\n\nFirst of all, the primary concerns for the author of this passage appears to be 1) the passing of the blessing, and 2) relations with outsiders. The second actually goes hand in hand with the first. As I mentioned in my original comment, family was extremely important for the passing of the covenant (God's promise to Abraham). Now, also keep in mind the earlier passages throughout Genesis that show Abraham going around and placing altars, which ultimately established land claims and served as cultic sites. The land was a key component of that covenant. They would have been concerned with the line of Abraham's claim to the land (see Genesis 33:19-20, Jacob purchases land from Shechem and then erects an altar, claiming the land for him (and the Israelite God)). Also, I guess I should stop using the word family and start using \"House of the Father\" or even just Abraham's kin. When this material was written, it is likely they were recording a (perceived) history of their kinship. So the Israelites would have been a group of people, whose primary link was the worship of the Israelite God. They would have wanted to further establish familial or kinship ties through a figure, because kinship was essential for survival. This particular region of the Mediterranean was relatively not agriculturally abundant, and working the land would have been hard. They can be best understood as subsistence farmers. \n\nBack to our passage, Genesis 34. Here we see a Canaanite from outside of the Israelite tribe forcefully taking an Israelite woman as his wife. The text then clearly says Shechem defiled Dinah. This is referring to him penetrating her. This does not necessarily mean he raped her, but at the end of the day whether he did or not is irrelevant for our purposes. We can draw conclusions not based on this fact. The text then says (chapter 7) that the sons of Jacob were upset because Shechem had committed an outrage by having lying with Jacob's daughter, and that it should not have been done. It continues to say that Hamor, Shechem's father proposed joining the two tribes by engaging in free marriage with one another. Shechem furthered this by offering any goods amount of good for Dinah. Jacob's sons responded by saying that this was against their custom to give their sister to one who was uncircumcised (the marker of the recipients of the covenant). Then they said they would enter into a covenant by circumcision. (Sidenote: they were forbidden from doing this according to Exodus 23). After some consulting with his people, Shechem agreed. Finally, we get to the portion where Dinah's brothers (Jacob's sons) Levi and Simeon took their slaughtered the males of Shechem's tribe. Jacob condemns them, his primary concern is how other peoples might react and act against the small tribe of Israel. They reply, by asking if Dinah should be treated like a whore. This is pretty much the end of that story, so for right now we can see a primary concern with marrying outside of the tribe. This is later picked up in Exodus. However, the condemnation is also later picked up. We in Genesis 49:5-7, Simeon and Levi are further condemned (in addition to receiving their blessing), \"Simeon and Levi are a pair. Their weapons are tools of lawlessness. Let not my person be included in their council, Let not my being be counted in their assembly. For when angry they slay men, And when pleased they maim oxen.

So, if Genesis 34 and 49 were written to explain a historical reality, this would have had to be a historical reality they had to explain.

Management of the extended household was also a primary concern for Greeks. One can be married and also be polygamous, the biblical Abraham for example. Polemics in support of monogamy was more prominent in Greek texts than Jewish ones. However, even they valued procreation more than monogamy. Older Spartans also sometimes allowed younger, more \"able\" men to have sex with their wives to give them a son. Other Greeks did not do this, and did value children that looked like their father (Hesiod). I'd guess but not conclude monogamous marriage had more to do with kinship, the household, and even politics. \n\nEdit: and even Greeks and Romans only thought of marriage and even monogamy as pertaining to one wife, this did not include sex with prostitutes for the majority. Roman men and women would often have sex with their slaves and with prostitutes, whereas women could not. Greek men could also have sex with their male students. This was not considered \"cheating\".

Much of it was natural, based on natural biological urges and drives of reproduction, monogamy, and family. Watch Little House on the Prarie and you might see and understand what went on in the minds  and communities of the past, and is still something to be obtained today. Love and honor is hard. It's actually much easier to embrace debauchery.\nPurity of women was important because of the tribal and family customs. In hunting/gathering societies it wasn't good for a woman to be impregnated by a man who would not devote his life to her. A woman with a child and no man to hunt, gather, and build a family with was a burden to the tribe or community because other men would have to work extra hard to support a child who wasn't theirs. Also, a woman with a child couldn't work a lot. She had to devote 24 hours a day to the child. Thousands of years ago tribes understood how important monogamy was, and how important it was that a woman should not take chances with sex and be impregnated without a committed man. Women also understood this very well. It was something that people understood without having to be told. \nMen and women also have a very strong urge to meet a lifelong mate. No one had to teach me about love, it just was. It was something that I experienced the first time I fell in love and realized that my woman was all that mattered to me, and she felt the same way toward me. This strong biological urge doesn't have to be taught, but we do celebrate it, or rather we used to.\nThis push to sexualize women is not a highly intellectual thing, nor does it lead to her happiness. Sex is quick, maybe 30 minutes if the man doesn't pull a wam,bam, thankyou maam. The repercussions of this free sex is unwanted pregnancy, STDs, and disappointment because sex without commitment is a 30 minute deal, stacked up against thousands of hours in a year. And no, men didn't get to screw a lot of women. Powerful men used force to gather harems, but it wasn't a good thing for the men who found a shortage of women, and the women who found themselves imprisoned in a breeding farm. Harems also led to worse things, mainly that of the ruler cutting the dicks off of thousands of men so that there wouldn't be any chance of the women in the harem finding love. She was in a breeding farm, dude. There was very little romance involved in this. Women competed for the ruler, and fought each other, not for love, because there wasn't any love involved, but rather for power within the kingdom of the ruler. Harems used sex to get stuff, and to get power. In the end, when they got past the flower of their youth, they were turned out to pasture just like cattle, when the ruler no longer thought they were pretty enough to screw.\nMy friend, monogamy, purity, and sexual union in marriage is a higher ideal, not a lower ideal. It shouldn't be frowned on nor marginalized. Those nations that marginalize marriage, purity, and monogamy will not thrive. They are opening a can or worms  for cultural destruction because it is love that makes the world go round, not cheap sex.

In many western countries divorce rates approach 50%. Those who remarry do so on average 3 times. Divorce and remarriage can thus result in \"serial monogamy\", i.e. multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time. This can be interpreted as a form of plural mating, as are those societies dominated by female-headed families in the Caribbean, Mauritius and Brazil where there is frequent rotation of unmarried partners.

", "id": "dacmcxb"}, {"comment": "Hi! \n\nIt looks like you are talking about the book *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by *Jared Diamond*.\n\nIt is probably good to know that modern historians and anthropologists are quite critical of, if not borderline/outright hostile to, *Guns, Germs, and Steel*. Put bluntly, historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history that, in the end, paradoxically supports the very racism/Eurocentricism he is attempting to argue against. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [\"just so stories\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.\n\nFirst, **Diamond notoriously cherry-picks data that supports his hypothesis while ignoring the complexity of the issues.**\n\nIn his chapter \"Lethal Gift of Livestock\" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) on his hand-picked All Star team could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. Diamond ignored the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. \n\nAlso, he cherry-picks history when discussing the conquest of the Inca.\n\n> Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.\n\nThis is just patently false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling \"game over.\" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were \"conquered\", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological \"advantage\", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, but Diamond doesn't mention that complexity. The Inka were conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered, and technology reigns supreme in Diamond's narrative. \n\nThis brings us to a second issue: **Diamond uncritically examines the historical record surrounding conquest.** \n\nPizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts, like Diamond seems to do, you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.\n\nFinally, **the construction of the arguments for GG&S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world-wide in general, as categorically inferior**. \n\nTo believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.\n\nInstead of *GG&S* try:\n\n- Restall *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*\n\n- Mann *1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus*\n\n- MacQuarrie *Last Days of the Inca*\n\n- And if you would like to hear more about infectious disease spread after contact...

But from what I remember from my history studies is that the worst culprit was smallpox, viral hemorrhagic fever and influenza and maybe even some more diseases carried over from Europe. \n\nSeeing as smallpox and influenza are viruses then antibiotics would probably have limited effect. Vaccination is what wiped the smallpox out. \n\nIf I understand your question correct if there was any danger that diseases could also come to Europe from America, then yes I guess it's possible. There were regular outbreaks of plague in Europe in the course of history. And the Spanish-flu tearing through Europe during the early 20th century is one of the deadliest diseases ever. \n\nBut Europe, Asia and Africa had at this time established trade routes with each other, and developed immunities and a regular basis.

The press in England and France were pretty open about the dealings, or lack thereof, the Confederates had with their governments. They had to have pretty much known the South's arms production capabilities, along with the fact that there wasn't a whole lot  of iron ore being mined in the CSA. It's not as if the Confederacy was a land of mystery, across the sea and completely unknown to the Union. It had been, and as far as the Union was concerned, still was, an integral part of the United States.

I am not arguing that the troop numbers were not exaggerated, but the way that you have made many assumptions, and because you don't source any of your statements, means that your argument can't be engaged with historical arguments.\n\nSo I'm going to list the most questionable assumptions of yours.\n\nYou say that commanders like McClellan knew that the South had \"now war\" to support the reported numbers. But the numbers fed to McClellan weren't *unthinkable*. Pinkerton was inconsistent, and he was undeniably wrong, but his estimates wavered from being 10,000 to 100,000 men off for the Army of Virginia.

Until then, little had been known about how the Germans ran the camp, and it was thought to be an internment camp or large prison rather than a death camp. His superiors approved the plan and provided him with a false identity card in the name of \"Tomasz Serafi\u0144ski\". On September 19, 1940, he deliberately went out during a Warsaw street roundup (\u0142apanka) and was caught by the Germans, along with some 2,000 civilians.\n\n\n\nAfter two days of detention in the Light Horse Guards Barracks, where prisoners suffered beatings with rubber truncheons, Pilecki was sent to Auschwitz and was assigned inmate number 4859.\n\nZOW, one of the the resistance movements in the camp, provided the Polish underground with invaluable information about the camp. From October 1940, ZOW sent reports to Warsaw, and beginning in March 1941, Pilecki's reports were being forwarded via the Polish resistance to the British government in London. In 1942, Pilecki's resistance movement was also broadcasting details on the number of arrivals and deaths in the camp and the inmates' conditions using a radio transmitter that was built by camp inmates. The secret radio station, built over seven months using smuggled parts, was broadcasting from the camp until the autumn of 1942, when it was dismantled by Pilecki's men after concerns that the Germans might discover its location because of \"one of our fellow's big mouth\".\n\n\n\nThese reports were a principal source of intelligence on Auschwitz for the Western Allies. Pilecki hoped that either the Allies would drop arms or troops into the camp or that the Home Army would organize an assault on it from outside. Such plans, however, were all judged impossible to carry out. Meanwhile, the Gestapo redoubled its efforts to ferret out ZOW members, succeeding in killing many of them. Pilecki decided to break out of the camp with the hope of convincing Home Army leaders personally that a rescue attempt was a valid option. When he was assigned to a night shift at a camp bakery outside the fence, he and two comrades overpowered a guard, cut the phone line and escaped on the night of 26/27 April 1943, taking with them documents stolen from the Germans.\"\n\n", "id": "daozgxr"}, {"comment": "That's one of the bravest things I have ever heard.

Put bluntly, historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history that, in the end, paradoxically supports the very racism/Eurocentricism he is attempting to argue against. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [\"just so stories\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.\n\nFirst, **Diamond notoriously cherry-picks data that supports his hypothesis while ignoring the complexity of the issues.**\n\nIn his chapter \"Lethal Gift of Livestock\" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) on his hand-picked All Star team could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. Diamond ignored the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. \n\nAlso, he cherry-picks history when discussing the conquest of the Inca.\n\n> Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.\n\nThis is just patently false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling \"game over.\" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were \"conquered\", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological \"advantage\", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, but Diamond doesn't mention that complexity. The Inka were conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered, and technology reigns supreme in Diamond's narrative. \n\nThis brings us to a second issue: **Diamond uncritically examines the historical record surrounding conquest.** \n\nPizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts, like Diamond seems to do, you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.\n\nFinally, **the construction of the arguments for GG&S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world-wide in general, as categorically inferior**. \n\nTo believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.\n\nInstead of *GG&S* try:\n\n- Restall *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*\n\n- Mann *1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus*\n\n- MacQuarrie *Last Days of the Inca*\n\n- And if you would like to hear more about infectious disease spread after contact...

Interestingly the Kriegsmarine stopped attempting it after they had sunk a british troop ship, while during the rescue attemps by several U-Boats to take the stranded on board they were getting attacked from the air by a USAAF plane that explicitly knew they were rescuing survivors and was ordered to attack anyway. \n\n>Operating partly under the dictates of the old prize rules, the U-boat commander, Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Werner Hartenstein, immediately commenced rescue operations. U-156 broadcast their humanitarian intent on open radio channels to all Allied forces in the area, and were joined by the crews of several other U-boats in the vicinity.\n\n>After surfacing and picking up survivors, who were laden on the foredeck, U-156 headed on the surface towards a rendezvous with Vichy French ships under Red Cross banners, with the intention of offloading the survivors. On its journey the U-boat was spotted by a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-24 Liberator bomber. The pilots reported the U-boat's location, intentions and the presence of survivors, but were explicitly ordered by their higher command to attack the ship. The B-24 killed dozens of Laconia's survivors with bombs and strafing attacks, forcing U-156 to cast their remaining survivors into the sea and crash dive to avoid being destroyed. The pilots of the B-24 mistakenly reported that they had sunk U-156, and were awarded medals for their bravery.\n\n>Rescue operations were continued by other vessels. Another U-boat, the U-506, was also attacked by US aircraft and forced to dive. A total of 1,113 survivors were eventually rescued, whilst 1,619 died (mostly Italian prisoners).\n\n>The event changed the general attitude of Germany's naval personnel towards rescuing stranded Allied seamen. The commanders of the Kriegsmarine (German navy) were shortly issued the \"Laconia Order\" by Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz, which specifically forbade any such attempt, thus helping to usher in unrestricted submarine warfare for the rest of the war. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laconia_incident", "id": "darhxb2"}, {"comment": "Interesting read, thanks.", "id": "dari7l2"}], [{"comment": "I get that they were nazis.

Infantry is very powerful when you come at it in a frontal assault, especially if they had pikes, but the formations do not turn quickly.\n\nIn the past, this is why you had cavalry on the field, especially cavalry that was not heavy cavalry.  That cavalry would be used to try and hit the powerful infantry formations from the sides and rear.  And when that happened, the only units mobile enough to protect your flanks were your own cavalry.\n\nThis is why you will look at pre-modern battle maps and see that the cavalry of each side sort of attacked each other and had their own battles on the side.  They were trying to beat the other side's cavalry so that they could get in position to flank the enemy infantry.  \n\nBack to the battle at hand, as others have noted, if the orcs still significantly outnumbered the armies of Man, they could have absorbed the attack and reformed to face the Rohrrim.  If they had a lot more troops, they could have formed a separate line and fended off the cavalry.  And if the orcs had cavalry, such as wolf riders, those units could have re-positioned to engage the Rohrrim.  \n\nSo why did they lose?  Lack of discipline and probably low morale.  If your troops are not well trained and have little command and control, they cannot respond well to an attack from another direction.  Their officers (such as they were) would overestimate the effect of the shock attack and not respond well.  With low morale and training and the troops would panic and not follow orders, even if they could be formulated.\n\nIn battle, panic is contagious unless you are well trained.  So an unexpected charge by a large, but unknown number of cavalry from an unexpected angle would have started a panic.  And once panic develops, formations break.  And once formations break, cavalry are very, very dangerous because they have mobility, height advantage, and big damn horses for trampling.  \n\nNow, someone like the Witch-King of Angmar on his flying beast could have stopped the panic through the sheer dread of his presence.  Having him killed was also a very important reason for the ultimate failure of the orcs.

Bayonets did make rifles useful in melee, but because the officer was not on the line he wouldn't have been carrying one. \n\nSwords continued to be useful in melee until the invention of cartridge rounds made charges and melee less common.

"], [1, "Adding to what others have posted; an officer's job on the battlefield is to command and control his troops, to provide direction and inspire. Toward that goal he was not expected to do a great deal of the actual fighting, so was lightly armed, a sword and perhaps a brace of pistols. "], [1, "Close quarters combat. In the early 1800s, rifles loaded slowly, and after a round or two, there would be a bayonet charge, with officers using swords.  Cavalry also used swords and when charging formations, could hack people's heads as they charged through the lines. \n\nHorse cavalry still had swords in WW1, but the pistol and rile were also issued, and infantry officers pretty much just had rifles. By WW2, only Japanese officers had swords, and they were mostly ceremonial (although sometimes used in banzi charges).

This meant that officers were disproportionately made up of the nobility, or otherwise men with significant wealth. There was a well-established distinction between the officer class and their enlisted soldiers.\n\nCombat is a mess, but enlisted soldiers were not trained to do very much besides stay orderly and do their jobs. Officers were the ones who managed their units and trained to maintain cohesion. They needed to be visually distinct from their men, and they also had different duties, being leaders rather than fighters. They had different uniforms, and generally behaved differently from their soldiers anyways, and to complement the quasi-noble origins of their job class, often carried swords around when giving orders.\n\nThe functional element of this practice was that nobody would mistake the guy with the sword for anything besides an officer. The cultural element of this practice is that it evoked and reinforced a particular class arrangement, that everybody would have been very aware of anyways.\n\nHand-to-hand combat was quite rare in the 17th and 18th centuries, so the combat capabilities of swords is pretty irrelevant. Nothing would have stopped an officer from picking up a rifle and taking part in the shooting either, except for their sense of proper decorum.

It was during this time that more fluid and small unit-based tactics like fire-and-maneuver started to be developed and adopted to replace the \"line fire\" tactics of the previous wars.

(Source: *Douglas Haig, 1861-1928*, Gerard de Groot, 1988.)\n\nWinston Churchill in his 1937 collection of essays, *Great Contemporaries*, wrote that Haig was \"quite friendly to the tanks\" but that he wouldn't have been able to invent the tank himself.\n\nHaig was the product of outdated training in British officer's schools, officers being taught doctrine and tactics without necessarily being taught how to apply them on their own and be original thinkers. That said, Haig did recognise the value of the machine gun almost two decades before the First World War began.", "id": "dake461"}, {"comment": "> Even after the war, Haig dismissed tanks and machineguns as the future of war and said that the horse-mounted cavalry charge would always be the strongest weapon in the arsenal.\n\nThat was a commonly held opinion.

Im sure youve seen painting [such as this one](http://www.legendsofamerica.com/photos-kansas/CivilWar.jpg) showing the officer pointing his sword to command a charge. The sword was/is a symbol of authority, and are still commonly worn on military dress uniforms.  [Example of a sword carried by a Marine NCO](https://d26horl2n8pviu.cloudfront.net/pictures/images/000/057/390/for_gallery_v2/39e7e18a.jpg?1440556859)\n\n2) As for the usefulness in combat, it was more use than a rifle. Officers didn't stand in the line like the regular soldiers, so if the officer was fighting it was almost certainly during a charge or after being charged where a rifle or pistol with only one shot was not very useful. Bayonets did make rifles useful in melee, but because the officer was not on the line he wouldn't have been carrying one. \n\nSwords continued to be useful in melee until the invention of cartridge rounds made charges and melee less common. Once that happened semi auto pistols became the new standard sidearm of the Officer. ", "id": "dajwehk"}], [{"comment": "Adding to what others have posted; an officer's job on the battlefield is to command and control his troops, to provide direction and inspire. Toward that goal he was not expected to do a great deal of the actual fighting, so was lightly armed, a sword and perhaps a brace of pistols. ", "id": "dajt949"}], [{"comment": "Close quarters combat. In the early 1800s, rifles loaded slowly, and after a round or two, there would be a bayonet charge, with officers using swords.  Cavalry also used swords and when charging formations, could hack people's heads as they charged through the lines. \n\nHorse cavalry still had swords in WW1, but the pistol and rile were also issued, and infantry officers pretty much just had rifles. By WW2, only Japanese officers had swords, and they were mostly ceremonial (although sometimes used in banzi charges). ", "id": "dajy9dp"}], [{"comment": "Officership in European armies during much of the 16-18th century was simply determined by whoever could round up the resources to maintain a unit of soldiers. This meant that officers were disproportionately made up of the nobility, or otherwise men with significant wealth. There was a well-established distinction between the officer class and their enlisted soldiers.\n\nCombat is a mess, but enlisted soldiers were not trained to do very much besides stay orderly and do their jobs. Officers were the ones who managed their units and trained to maintain cohesion. They needed to be visually distinct from their men, and they also had different duties, being leaders rather than fighters. They had different uniforms, and generally behaved differently from their soldiers anyways, and to complement the quasi-noble origins of their job class, often carried swords around when giving orders.\n\nThe functional element of this practice was that nobody would mistake the guy with the sword for anything besides an officer. The cultural element of this practice is that it evoked and reinforced a particular class arrangement, that everybody would have been very aware of anyways.\n\nHand-to-hand combat was quite rare in the 17th and 18th centuries, so the combat capabilities of swords is pretty irrelevant. Nothing would have stopped an officer from picking up a rifle and taking part in the shooting either, except for their sense of proper decorum. And officer is supposed to give orders and make their unit more effective, not try to take part in combat.\n", "id": "dak2rhm"}], [{"comment": "> I should also add, when exactly did officer's begin to use rifles more?\n\nI think it wasn't until the Second World War that the company-level officers in major armies started carrying the same service weapons as their rank-and-file subordinates into battle. It was during this time that more fluid and small unit-based tactics like fire-and-maneuver started to be developed and adopted to replace the \"line fire\" tactics of the previous wars. It made more sense for a captain or lieutenant leading his platoon in forward action to have a rifle or submachine gun, rather than just a dress sword or short-range sidearm.\n\n \n\n", "id": "dak7jhv"}], [{"comment": "As others have noted, those officers were only ever expected to fight at close range.  Just to add to that though, that doesn't necessarily mean they'd only be pointing that pistol or sword at foreign enemies.  Plenty of soldiers never volunteered in the first place, regretted signing up later, or had other cause to try and say no to an order.  Officers were armed against their own soldiers as well as enemy troops breaking through the lines.  Either way it was close quarters combat and the ability to quickly deal with multiple opponents without reloading would be key.  A brace of single-shot pistols and a sturdy sword fit the bill well.", "id": "dakx58v"}], [{"comment": "In the early 1800s they were pretty useful as rifles were very slow to reload and very inaccurate but were mainly used by officers as they were a symbol of wealth and rank. As time went by rifles got more and more accurate and the gatling gun and repeater rifles were invented they kind of made them useless but they were kept for ceremonial and rank reasons.

Despite everything he did for Germany, when the Nazis came to power he was cast out for his Jewish background and forced to flee.

There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [\"just so stories\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.\n\nFirst, **Diamond notoriously cherry-picks data that supports his hypothesis while ignoring the complexity of the issues.**\n\nIn his chapter \"Lethal Gift of Livestock\" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) on his hand-picked All Star team could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. Diamond ignored the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. \n\nAlso, he cherry-picks history when discussing the conquest of the Inca.\n\n> Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.\n\nThis is just patently false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling \"game over.\" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were \"conquered\", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological \"advantage\", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, but Diamond doesn't mention that complexity. The Inka were conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered, and technology reigns supreme in Diamond's narrative. \n\nThis brings us to a second issue: **Diamond uncritically examines the historical record surrounding conquest.** \n\nPizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts, like Diamond seems to do, you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.\n\nFinally, **the construction of the arguments for GG&S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world-wide in general, as categorically inferior**. \n\nTo believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.\n\nInstead of *GG&S* try:\n\n- Restall *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*\n\n- Mann *1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus*\n\n- MacQuarrie *Last Days of the Inca*\n\n- And if you would like to hear more about infectious disease spread after contact...

You became an officer because you were a member of the military class - usually their was a family tradition of military service.  \n\nThey would have probably been members of the gentry or upper classes, they would have attended the public schools that acted as gatekeepers of upper class society (these schools often had a military component designed to prepare attendees for possible military service), and advancement was a political process as much as a military one.  Almost no officers were promoted to the position from the rank and file at the start of the war.  The British army had only abolished the practice of openly purchasing officer commissions a scant few decades before.\n\nThis eased back as the war went on out of sheer necessity, but it never really went away.  \"An officer and a gentleman\" is a phrase you might have heard - well, the gentleman was as essential to promotion as the officer part.  Complex british class etiquette played a role in officer selection for the whole war.  Upperclass pursuits like horsemanship and hunting played an outsized role in promotion.   Officer pay also did not usually cover the expected expenses of the officer lifestyle, so independent income was essential for someone seeking long term career success.\n\nBy the end of the war a number of low ranking officers were commissioned from the lower classes, their commission was explicitly just through the duration of the war.  They were referred to as \"Temporary Officers\" officially, but unofficially they were also insultingly called \"Temporary Gentleman\".  That should tell you a lot about what it meant to be an officer then.\n\nThis created a really odd dynamic.  In the trenches and during the actual fighting, raw talent was prized and encouraged, and lower born officers and those in the ranks were valued.  But that value evaporated from the perspective of any real potential military career."], [1, "In the British Army officer selection as heavily based on social class. Indeed, the military was a major means of reinforcing the class system in Victorian times when a regimental commission would be formally purchased and there was a hierarchy of desirability among the regiments.\n\nWhile this was less the case in the 20th Century wars, the tradition remained very strong.\n\nOf course, with the mass slaughter of the First World War things changed somewhat, but having a forefather in the regiment, a family connection, was still very important. Soldiers could be commissioned from the ranks but this remained the exception. While a university degree was not essential (though it would almost guarantee a commission), there was a benefit that these officers would be pretty well educated through the other branch of the class system, the public schools. \n\nThe Royal Flying Corps was not at first an elite organisation, and the path into it for many men was simply to stump up the money for private flying lessons, and application for a transfer. Many others applied after being wounded as infantry- or cavalrymen. It was not really until 1917 that fighter pilots became 'stars', but the practicalities of flying the then-capricious machines meant that some acumen was required, and had to be shown in training. But overall it was less competitive as flying was new, dangerous and less desirable than fighting in an elite regiment.\n\nInterestingly, the *Lafayette Escadrille*, the all-American squadron raised by the French, was exclusively occupied by millionaires' sons.\n\nThe Germans took a slightly different approach. They had a similar system to the British as regards entry, but a man had to fly in observation aircraft for a time, and prove his aggression and skill to gain transfer to the fighters.\n\nThe Second World War saw these systems basically continue, but even more watered-down. Between the wars, the RAF was a sort of rich boys' flying club (the poor boys got to repair the planes) but the hard realities of World War II saw the British establish a massive training system in Canada, Australia etc. The very fact of these training bases being in the colonies broke down the 'good breeding' requirement that had grown in the RAF. Men could apply for transfer from Army units with a good chance of success, and performance in training became vital. My father, an Australian of humble origins, transferred from the Army in 1942 and trained as an air gunner: he chose not to train as a pilot for fear he'd 'miss the war' with the prolonged course.\n\nThe Luftwaffe was similar. Germany was not allowed an air force under the Versailles Treaty so in 1934 Hitler, or more accurately Goering, was able to build it from the ground up, transferring in men from the ground forces. Being German, birth was not very important but measured skill and military prowess was, and with high demand the 1939 Luftwaffe was by some margin the best air force in the world, aggressive, well-equipped, with a practical attitude to air fighting (the British were obsessed with smooth landings on their small grass airfields, the Italians with formation flying and aerobatics). \n\nI know in the US the Navy was the desirable pathway for rich boys, a certain attitude of staying out of the mud being prevalent, and no doubt the ruling class passtime of yachting played a role (eg, JFK). \n\nOverall with regards to your question, bear in mind that in wartime those Ranger tabs and such become far less important: success, or at least experience, in battle trumps all such peacetime awards."]], [[{"comment": " If one had a university degree then you were on the fast track for a commission.  or if one was a very bright EM and noticed by seniors then they could be recommended for OTC.

This is not a matter of opinion or belief.\n\nEdit: and public school did not mean \"university\", it meant one of a very select group of schools that were extremely exclusive and limited to the upper classes.

You became an officer because you were a member of the military class - usually their was a family tradition of military service.  \n\nThey would have probably been members of the gentry or upper classes, they would have attended the public schools that acted as gatekeepers of upper class society (these schools often had a military component designed to prepare attendees for possible military service), and advancement was a political process as much as a military one.  Almost no officers were promoted to the position from the rank and file at the start of the war.  The British army had only abolished the practice of openly purchasing officer commissions a scant few decades before.\n\nThis eased back as the war went on out of sheer necessity, but it never really went away.  \"An officer and a gentleman\" is a phrase you might have heard - well, the gentleman was as essential to promotion as the officer part.  Complex british class etiquette played a role in officer selection for the whole war.  Upperclass pursuits like horsemanship and hunting played an outsized role in promotion.   Officer pay also did not usually cover the expected expenses of the officer lifestyle, so independent income was essential for someone seeking long term career success.\n\nBy the end of the war a number of low ranking officers were commissioned from the lower classes, their commission was explicitly just through the duration of the war.  They were referred to as \"Temporary Officers\" officially, but unofficially they were also insultingly called \"Temporary Gentleman\".  That should tell you a lot about what it meant to be an officer then.\n\nThis created a really odd dynamic.  In the trenches and during the actual fighting, raw talent was prized and encouraged, and lower born officers and those in the ranks were valued.  But that value evaporated from the perspective of any real potential military career.", "id": "dai4rv2"}], [{"comment": "In the British Army officer selection as heavily based on social class. Indeed, the military was a major means of reinforcing the class system in Victorian times when a regimental commission would be formally purchased and there was a hierarchy of desirability among the regiments.\n\nWhile this was less the case in the 20th Century wars, the tradition remained very strong.\n\nOf course, with the mass slaughter of the First World War things changed somewhat, but having a forefather in the regiment, a family connection, was still very important. Soldiers could be commissioned from the ranks but this remained the exception. While a university degree was not essential (though it would almost guarantee a commission), there was a benefit that these officers would be pretty well educated through the other branch of the class system, the public schools. \n\nThe Royal Flying Corps was not at first an elite organisation, and the path into it for many men was simply to stump up the money for private flying lessons, and application for a transfer. Many others applied after being wounded as infantry- or cavalrymen. It was not really until 1917 that fighter pilots became 'stars', but the practicalities of flying the then-capricious machines meant that some acumen was required, and had to be shown in training. But overall it was less competitive as flying was new, dangerous and less desirable than fighting in an elite regiment.\n\nInterestingly, the *Lafayette Escadrille*, the all-American squadron raised by the French, was exclusively occupied by millionaires' sons.\n\nThe Germans took a slightly different approach. They had a similar system to the British as regards entry, but a man had to fly in observation aircraft for a time, and prove his aggression and skill to gain transfer to the fighters.\n\nThe Second World War saw these systems basically continue, but even more watered-down. Between the wars, the RAF was a sort of rich boys' flying club (the poor boys got to repair the planes) but the hard realities of World War II saw the British establish a massive training system in Canada, Australia etc. The very fact of these training bases being in the colonies broke down the 'good breeding' requirement that had grown in the RAF. Men could apply for transfer from Army units with a good chance of success, and performance in training became vital. My father, an Australian of humble origins, transferred from the Army in 1942 and trained as an air gunner: he chose not to train as a pilot for fear he'd 'miss the war' with the prolonged course.\n\nThe Luftwaffe was similar. Germany was not allowed an air force under the Versailles Treaty so in 1934 Hitler, or more accurately Goering, was able to build it from the ground up, transferring in men from the ground forces. Being German, birth was not very important but measured skill and military prowess was, and with high demand the 1939 Luftwaffe was by some margin the best air force in the world, aggressive, well-equipped, with a practical attitude to air fighting (the British were obsessed with smooth landings on their small grass airfields, the Italians with formation flying and aerobatics). \n\nI know in the US the Navy was the desirable pathway for rich boys, a certain attitude of staying out of the mud being prevalent, and no doubt the ruling class passtime of yachting played a role (eg, JFK). \n\nOverall with regards to your question, bear in mind that in wartime those Ranger tabs and such become far less important: success, or at least experience, in battle trumps all such peacetime awards.", "id": "dai59yq"}]]], "5fxm4x": ["G\u00f6beklitepe: World's oldest temple to be nominated for Heritage List", "2016-12-01 19:51:13", 3814, "http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2016/11/18/worlds-oldest-temple-to-be-nominated-for-heritage-list", [[342, "I'm honestly surprised it isn't already on the list.

The three peoples who are thought to have built Stonehenge and the sites around it are seen as prime examples of the evolution of organized, communal living in the British Isles.\n\nThe first group, the Windmill Hill people, named after one of their earthworks on Windmill Hill, near Stonehenge, built the large circular furrows and mounds. They had collective burials in large stone-encased tombs. Most of their burial mounds point east-west. Originating in eastern England, they were one of the first semi-nomadic hunting and gathering groups with an agricultural economy, maintaining a strong reverence for circles and symmetry.\n \nThe second group - The Beaker people - is thought to have originated in Spain, migrating northwards and colonizing north-west Europe. Their name comes from their ancient traditions in which they would bury beakers, or pottery drinking cups, with their dead.\n \n\nInstead of burying their dead in mass graves, they showed more reverence for death by placing them in small round graves marked by mounds called tumuli. It is assumed by archaeologists that the Beaker People were more warlike in nature than most tribes of their time because they buried their dead with more weapons, such as daggers and battle-axes. The Beaker Folk were highly organised and industrious, using sophisticated mathematical concepts, and they managed their society by using a chieftain system.\n\n \n\nThe Wessex People are considered the third and final group to work on the Stonehenge site. They arrived around 1500 B.C. at the height of the Bronze Age. They were among the most advanced cultures outside the Mediterranean during this period. Since their tribal bases were located where ridgeways, or ancient roads, met, we can assume they became skillful and well-organized traders, controlling trade routes throughout southern Britain.

We know that the Japanese war council was flat-out refusing to consider unconditional surrender as late as August 9th (after two a-bombs and the Soviet inasion). They were split 3-3 on surrender on certain peace terms (the former camp advocating only that the Emperor's position be protected, the latter that Japan conduct its own disarmament and war crimes trials, and not be occupied).

Before learning of the American nuclear program in mid '44 he was seriously considering pushing Soviet tanks right to the Bay of Biscay. Even in April 1945 he likely would've ordered attacks on any Allied forces heading for Berlin.

The Ottoman Empire can't really be thought of as a Nation beyond Turkey. I believe their control over the Arabian Peninsula was far from absolute and probably non-existent for the interior Bedouin tribes. Even the cities and ports that were under the Ottoman Empire were semi-autonomously run by local chiefs. \n\nMany parts of the Middle East were this way even if they were formally under an Empire. For example, modern day Afghanistan was often officially ruled by either Persian, Central Asian or Mughal Empires but outside of the main cities these Empire's control was likely weak and the cooperation of the tribes often depended on opportunities for young warriors to gather loot. For example, the Mughal Empire in India recruited most of it's officers and cavalry from Afghan and Central Asian tribes thus ensuring their loyalty. Similarly, when Ahmad Shah Duraani (Durrani being his tribe) managed to convince the Afghans to make him King he retained their loyalty by constantly raiding and looting what is today Pakistan and India.\n\nI think I went on a tangent but perhaps the situation in the Arabian Peninsula was similar to Afghanistan where the cooperation of the Bedouin tribes was dependent on the opportunities given by a ruler to the male tribal members. Perhaps a strong central state presented fewer raiding opportunities for the tribes due to the state enforcing a peace over the peninsula while a weak state needed to enlist the help of tribes in putting down rebellions.

It was the purposeful relegation of millions and millions of people into functional servitude. The vast majority of people in a European colony saw extremely limited benefits for their toil, and there ability to affect change. After all, the Europeans had a vested interest in maintaining the status quo in perpetuity, and were quick to replace strongmen who would tolerate their rule.\n"], [6, "There was a lot of technological change in firearms in the 19th c. colonial period, and improvements came at varying rates, simply put. Repeating rifles were around by 1865, but not immediately implemented. Even though Winchester would actively seek military buyers for its lever-action rifles ( and found them- the Winchester 66 was used by Turkey, France..and inspired the Swiss to make a tube-magazine fed bolt-action, the Vetterli)  lever-action firearms like the Winchester were found to be difficult to clean, harder to use in the prone position, and generally more fragile than other breech-loading designs, especially bolt actions. And there was a common assumption by many officers that, given a magazine firearm,  soldiers would simply shoot off all their ammunition.  But there was also huge cost in modernizing arsenals: an army needed a lot of rifles, and so replacing all of them obviously was expensive. Often half-measures lasted quite some time.  The British may have quickly discarded the Snider conversion of their muzzle-loading Enfield rifle after several years , with the adoption of the Martini Henry in 1871, but the US kept and merely upgraded the 1866  Allen conversion of the Springfield muzzle-loading rifle, keeping it as the Trapdoor Springfield well into the 1890's ( yes, long after all those Winchester Model 66 rifles...and ten years after most European nations had gone to bolt action smokeless powder repeating rifles)\n\nThe mechanism of the rifle was sometimes not the only issue.  When the British sent a force to rescue Gordon at Khartoum, in 1885, they came up against the Mahdi's forces armed with Remington Rolling Block rifles, roughly equivalent to their Martini Henry rifles. But the ammunition for the Rolling block rifles was better made.  Charles Beresford described British rifles being constantly handed back from the lines because the spent cartridge cases had torn rather than extracted, and officers had to clear them. The Mahdi's rifles had no such problem.\n\n\n"], [6, "Lever actions had a smaller calibre and a shorter range. You could fire and reload faster but still you'd take hits from the enemy before you could reach his soldiers."], [6, "Most lever action rifles at the time fired a pistol caliber round, as well, the lever action makes firing from a prone position difficult because you can't cycle the action easily. "], [10, "The Europeans had two basic issues with fast firing weaponry against tribes in Africa.  \n\n1. \nThey would be fighting against native tribes armed with spears and bows and arrows. It wasn't considered necessary to invest time and money in developing new and advanced weaponry\n2.\nMany nations around the world thought that lever action rifles and machine guns would be worthless to an army. Many thought they would just be a waste of ammo and a logistical nightmare to be able to supply ammunition to armies."], [2, "Lever actions were fairly new to the scene and still rather expensive compared to a breechloader. When you are fighting less technologically developed opponents, breechloader are adequate and cheaper to field. "], [2, "Their are a few reasons. \n\n1) Lever actions can't be effectively fired in prone position.\n\n2) When fire continously for a long period of time lever actions become less accurate because the barrel heats up faster then the bands that hold the rifles together. \n\n3) Too much dust and sand causes lever actions to jam \n\n"], [2, "The lever-action firearms used in the American Civil War weren't that common (only 10,000 Henry Rifles were produced during the war). The rifled musket and later the single-shot breech-loading rifle (with trapdoor or falling-block action) was still the mainstay of the common foot-soldier or frontier settler even in the USA. As someone already mention, cost and production time would had been a factor that discouraged the adoption of a multi-shot lever-action rifle as a standard service arm. \n\nMost lever-actions before Winchester's release of the Model 1876 were chambered for handgun cartridges, which meant they had much shorter range and lethality compare to their single-shot rifle counterparts that were chambered for larger, more powerful cartridges. The Model 1873 chambered in .44-40 would have had the same performance as a modern day .357 Magnum, good to a 100 yards at most. Compare this to the Martini-Henry Rifle in .577/450 used by the British in the Zulu Wars, which would have no problem touching a man out to 400 yards. That's at least four times the range at maybe half the rate of fire, a fair tradeoff for a cheaper and less complex weapon. \n\nThan there's the fact that a lever-action is hard to operate in the proned position, as the ground gets in the way of the downward swinging lever. Not too much a problem for a cavalryman on horseback, but it becomes a problem for an infantryman or dismounted carbineer trying to avoid enemy detection and fire by hugging the ground. \n\nThe non-detachable tube magazine would had also remove the advantage the lever-action's higher rate of fire once it was expended, and a soldier would had needed to feed in a cartridge one-by-one just like a single-shot during the heat of battle.\n\nThere's also a reliability issue with lever actions. I have a new production Winchester 1892 rifle in .357, and I can tell you it sometimes fails to load a round from the magazine, most often because I went on the return stroke a few millimeters too soon. Lever-actions just aren't as reliable as bolt actions (which is why the latter was adopted wholesale by the First World War, and the former was not), and there's nothing more reliable than a single-shot breechloading rifle. Lever-actions have more complex parts than either, and in the days when black powder was the main and only propellant, any bit of fouling in the wrong places would had resulted in a jammed and useless weapon. "], [1, "Tactics.  For example, the key to British success in Africa was the square formation and the ability to coordinate volley fire.  This helped to maximize damage against large masses of on coming soldiers.  Even with the introduction of the Lee Enfield .303 which was a magazine fed bolt-action rifle the tendency was still for British troops to manually load each round through the bolt.  For example check out the Battle of Omdurman at the end of the Anglo-Sudanese War.   "], [1, "Lever action rifle contracts from American Patents were expensive for government contracts when compared to Breechloaders like the Martin Henry or Tower Breech Loader. The Spencer was contracted (in limited use) in France and used during the Franco Prussian War, however the Prussian use of Breech loaders was more effective. \n\nEven into the colonization of Africa, the Crimean War and the Franco Prussian War, the Muzzle loader was still the Chief arm of most nations until the Bolt Action was introduced in 1897. The Muzzle Loaders were still very accurate under the Percussion Cap Rifled Musket System, however their military use in Napoleonic Tactics was a cause of high casualty rates, as seen in the American civil War. The US military was probably the first military to fully integrate the use of breech loading weapons from the Indian Wars (which required a smaller number of active troops, mostly armed with Spencer Rifles, Henry Rifles and Sharps Carbines) and then the Spanish American War which introduced the Rolling block system.\n  "], [1, "Stand off range was considered more important then fast rate of fire at close range. A lever action of the time generally fired a pistol or smaller round."], [1, "As someone said, lever action rifles use weaker caliber rounds than other types of actions. \n\nAnd weaker rounds provide less stopping power. Americans found this out the hard way in Mindanao when their .38 caliber pistols could not stop Moro Juramentados from charging straight at them with Bolo knives.\n\nIf you are firing prone or in a trench, its harder to cycle the action since you have to press the lever down.\n\nThe tubular magazine is alleged to have been dangerously prone to exploding since the bullets are tipped up against the cartridge of another bullet."], [-1, "They were expensive, fragile, and peoples of the time saw melee as a more honourable and effective form of combat.\n\n\nAnd to be fair, melee remained extremely effective even in WW1, so while they were wrong, they weren't as wrong as you'd first think.\n\n\nIn addition to that, they are not easy to fire prone, and you had artillery for long range/barrage fire.\n\nThe civil war troops were much less trained and effective than your usual European line infantry,  so they relied on fireing  their weapons a lot, where European troops of the time would have charge much more readily.

But when there's sufficient motivation, it does happen. England has a civil war in the 17th century that most people would recognize as an important formative event for England as a modern state. The English Civil War ended with a real result, a tremendous increase of Parliamentary power, despite 3-4 decades of on-and-off political turmoil.  But there was nobody around to toy with English politics, no powerful, intangible nation to pick and choose sides based on their own-self interest. Specifically, self-interest not governed by morality or civic duty, economic and geopolitical self-interest. Had such a hypothetical nation existed, the English Civil War would have been quashed within a year, Charles I by \"divine right\" maintained, and the English nation might have taken a completely different path.\n\nThis is what it means to deprive people of civil responsibilities. It's harmful, and in our Eurocentric present, injustifiable because it violates the fundamental principles of the European enlightenment that made industrialization possible. By taking away the power of a people to determine their own government, however they would go about doing that, European states were denying people the ability to create their own modern states. In most cases, this was done deliberately so that European-owned resource extraction sites could continue turning a profit. After all, if Kenya became a modern, self-governing nation-state, its government would probably not wish to give all its export profits to the British.\n\nSo the justification for this contradictory set of values was simply that \"enlightenment\" could be quantified, and that some peoples were not enlightened, did not have enlightened rulers, and so could only be ruled by \"enlightened\" states. Ireland was one those states, and in a process not unlike the colonization of Africa, turned into a big plantation, and its population denigrated as unruly idiots who couldn't be trusted to manage themselves. Of course, these labels were applied without any real basis, they were applied *ipso facto*. European states could subjugate and disenfranchise these peoples, and then turn right around and use the subjugation and disenfranchisement of these people as sign that they were not \"enlightened\".\n\nThe absurdist conclusion one can draw from these actions is that enlightenment and exploitation of others go hand-in-hand, which I why I made a flippant joke about it. \n\nWith regards to Africans, this contradiction was resolved in even more racially elevated ways. Not only were Europeans subjugating and disenfranchising Africans, they were literally shackling them to work was slaves. Slavery had to be justified the same way, but with even more extreme distortions of reality. To rationalize enslavement Africans were not only denigrated, they were infantilized. Europeans began to believe that Africans *needed* to be enslaved or otherwise subservient, or else they would hurt themselves and others. \n\nAgain, this was an *ipso facto* justification, Europeans bought slaves, and then turn around and use those peoples' enslavement as a sign that they were *meant to be enslaved*. \n\nSo, the 19th century and the \"Race for Africa\" is the culmination of what these beliefs ended up creating. Europeans could and had justified any sort of subjugative process they could attempt, and they had the means as powerful industrial states to really meddle in states that previously were too far away, and too strong to usurp in such a manner. Of course, the only countries that were enlightened were simply the only countries that could not be co-opted.", "id": "dajo3kq"}, {"comment": "This has so much wrong in it i don't know where to start, it's overwhelming.", "id": "dak4xib"}, {"comment": "It takes a lot of words to describe complicated things.

Even though Winchester would actively seek military buyers for its lever-action rifles ( and found them- the Winchester 66 was used by Turkey, France..and inspired the Swiss to make a tube-magazine fed bolt-action, the Vetterli)  lever-action firearms like the Winchester were found to be difficult to clean, harder to use in the prone position, and generally more fragile than other breech-loading designs, especially bolt actions. And there was a common assumption by many officers that, given a magazine firearm,  soldiers would simply shoot off all their ammunition.  But there was also huge cost in modernizing arsenals: an army needed a lot of rifles, and so replacing all of them obviously was expensive. Often half-measures lasted quite some time.  The British may have quickly discarded the Snider conversion of their muzzle-loading Enfield rifle after several years , with the adoption of the Martini Henry in 1871, but the US kept and merely upgraded the 1866  Allen conversion of the Springfield muzzle-loading rifle, keeping it as the Trapdoor Springfield well into the 1890's ( yes, long after all those Winchester Model 66 rifles...and ten years after most European nations had gone to bolt action smokeless powder repeating rifles)\n\nThe mechanism of the rifle was sometimes not the only issue.

As someone already mention, cost and production time would had been a factor that discouraged the adoption of a multi-shot lever-action rifle as a standard service arm. \n\nMost lever-actions before Winchester's release of the Model 1876 were chambered for handgun cartridges, which meant they had much shorter range and lethality compare to their single-shot rifle counterparts that were chambered for larger, more powerful cartridges. The Model 1873 chambered in .44-40 would have had the same performance as a modern day .357 Magnum, good to a 100 yards at most. Compare this to the Martini-Henry Rifle in .577/450 used by the British in the Zulu Wars, which would have no problem touching a man out to 400 yards. That's at least four times the range at maybe half the rate of fire, a fair tradeoff for a cheaper and less complex weapon. \n\nThan there's the fact that a lever-action is hard to operate in the proned position, as the ground gets in the way of the downward swinging lever. Not too much a problem for a cavalryman on horseback, but it becomes a problem for an infantryman or dismounted carbineer trying to avoid enemy detection and fire by hugging the ground. \n\nThe non-detachable tube magazine would had also remove the advantage the lever-action's higher rate of fire once it was expended, and a soldier would had needed to feed in a cartridge one-by-one just like a single-shot during the heat of battle.\n\nThere's also a reliability issue with lever actions. I have a new production Winchester 1892 rifle in .357, and I can tell you it sometimes fails to load a round from the magazine, most often because I went on the return stroke a few millimeters too soon. Lever-actions just aren't as reliable as bolt actions (which is why the latter was adopted wholesale by the First World War, and the former was not), and there's nothing more reliable than a single-shot breechloading rifle.

I'm only going to comment on Greco-Roman paganism. After the emperors began taking up the \"banner\" of the Christian God, they increasingly began to be interested and involved in theological matters. At first this manifested itself in rooting out heresies, but it eventually developed into laws against paganism and even Judaism. This really picked up steam in the fourth century. However, paganism did not quickly go away. Nor was Christianity always a unified movement (hence the desire to root out perceived heresies). Going back to the prior point, paganism persisted for many centuries but was largely privatized. Eventually it was just phased out, as a major aspect of pagan \"religion(s)\" was the social aspect and social functions such as sacrifice and festivals. As these activities were strictly outlawed, Greco-Roman paganism was only practiced in private and in secrecy. As those activities were major aspects of pagan \"religion(s)\", and because of the simple fact it was outlawed, it slowly but eventually stopped being prominent. As other commentors have mentioned, in a sense it did not \"die out.\" There were always groups that the Romans and later Byzantines, and even later Western peoples, interacted with that were not monotheistic. These groups would have had some attraction to a very small minority of people within the spheres in question. Another interesting question to ask is how did later Christians or Abrahamic monotheists engage earlier pagan literature, how did they adopt pagan cosmological ideas, etc.. \n\nEdit: As someone else pointed out, Julian the Apostate was an emperor just after Constantine that tried to reverse the trend of Christianization. What would have happened had he lived another 3, 5, 10, or 20 years?? We'll never know, but it's interesting to think about!\n\nEdit 2: Something else I'd like to point out was there were some monotheistic and henotheistic trends among pagan groups. It's not as contradictory as one may think! Even though Plato was a polytheist, one group of later philosophers developed a style of monotheism based on certain aspects of his thought. \n\nEdit 3: grammar"], [10, "The last real stand of paganism in Europe was the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state, but was ruled by pagans from its establishment in the late 1100s early 1200s until 1386^1  and had a significant pagan population (both peasant and nobility), which was deeply entrenched in their beliefs. It survived by a series of competent rulers (with a few notable exceptions) who played by playing Catholic and Orthodox rulers and powers off each other, as well as balancing Catholic, Orthodox, and pagan internal politics. It's actually a fascinating example of excellent rulership and statecraft, particularly the accounts of Gediminas, Algirdas, and K\u0119stutis. After 1386 the pagan population was rapidly Christianized by the efforts of the rulers, and while some pagan superstitions and traditions survived for centuries afterwards, but it would be wrong to say the religion itself did.\n\n^1 One ruler, Mindaugas, converted to Catholicism in 1250ish and declared the Kingdom of Lithuania, but he was assassinated and his successors reverted to the old pagan Grand Duchy."], [4, "You may enjoy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization and check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_(emperor) He tried to bring Roman Paganism back."], [3, "What's interesting is that Orthodox Christianity wasn't as strict as you might have thought in the Middle Ages. Ensuring that people followed Catholic doctrine was not particularly practiced by the authorities until 12^th + centuries. Many people had more personal practices and beliefs which would have been influenced (or driven) by pagan ideology, even if it was *fundamentally* Catholic. Catholic doctrine started to become more uniform during this time, which is why there's a perceived increase in heretical sects (like the Lollards, Hussites, Waldensians etc. which were basically Christian, but were heretics because they rejected the authority of the Papacy or had doctrinal differences with Orthodox Christianity), but not really beforehand. That being said, there were specific cases of rulers trying to enforce Christianity, as with Charlemagne and the Saxons, but these weren't always successful or as influential as Charlemagne's attempts.\n\nEdit: there's not really a defined cut-off for seemingly large-scale pagan practice.

After the fall of Rome, Christian missionaries converted many of the Germanic kings who then rules Europe. Conversion of Ireland really took hold with St.Patrick around late 400 AD. Soon after their arrival in England, the Anglo-Saxons likely converted (around 600 AD?). Clovis the King of the Franks (France, parts of Germany) converted to Christianity around 500 AD, as had many of the other Germanic rulers (Goths - Italy, Spain and Vandals - North Africa). The conversion of kings often led to the Chritianization of the Kingdom and hence further conversions by the King's subjects. Many kings continued to convert to Christianity into the first millennium AD around which time Northern Europe and the Vikings were finally brought under the fold. \n\nPaganism likely continued in secret for a bit longer but tended to be stamped out by the Kings and the Church. Also once the majority of Kings were Christian, it was pragmatic for a King to also convert since this would increase his chances of entering into alliances and make it more difficult for Christian Kings to use religion as an excuse to declare war. For example, Charlemagne was famous for declaring war on pagans and then force converting them once they were conquered.\n\nTo answer your question I would say around the turn of the first millennium, pagan pantheons no longer occupied a prominent direct role European society."], [2, "Probably during the early middle ages. After the fall of the western roman empire, much of western europe regressed to paganism. That was until around 500 AD, when missionaries were sent to these kingdoms from rome.

So now, the areas that were once palastine, armenia, persia, mesopatamia, syria, turkey, and nearly all of africa north of the equator had either converted to islam or christianity.

I'm only going to comment on Greco-Roman paganism. After the emperors began taking up the \"banner\" of the Christian God, they increasingly began to be interested and involved in theological matters. At first this manifested itself in rooting out heresies, but it eventually developed into laws against paganism and even Judaism. This really picked up steam in the fourth century. However, paganism did not quickly go away. Nor was Christianity always a unified movement (hence the desire to root out perceived heresies). Going back to the prior point, paganism persisted for many centuries but was largely privatized. Eventually it was just phased out, as a major aspect of pagan \"religion(s)\" was the social aspect and social functions such as sacrifice and festivals. As these activities were strictly outlawed, Greco-Roman paganism was only practiced in private and in secrecy. As those activities were major aspects of pagan \"religion(s)\", and because of the simple fact it was outlawed, it slowly but eventually stopped being prominent. As other commentors have mentioned, in a sense it did not \"die out.\" There were always groups that the Romans and later Byzantines, and even later Western peoples, interacted with that were not monotheistic. These groups would have had some attraction to a very small minority of people within the spheres in question. Another interesting question to ask is how did later Christians or Abrahamic monotheists engage earlier pagan literature, how did they adopt pagan cosmological ideas, etc.. \n\nEdit: As someone else pointed out, Julian the Apostate was an emperor just after Constantine that tried to reverse the trend of Christianization. What would have happened had he lived another 3, 5, 10, or 20 years?? We'll never know, but it's interesting to think about!\n\nEdit 2: Something else I'd like to point out was there were some monotheistic and henotheistic trends among pagan groups. It's not as contradictory as one may think! Even though Plato was a polytheist, one group of later philosophers developed a style of monotheism based on certain aspects of his thought. \n\nEdit 3: grammar", "id": "dajypus"}, {"comment": "I also read somewhere that a lot of old gods became some kind of saint and that the multiple god panteon was somehow transformed into the christian idea of saints.

It survived by a series of competent rulers (with a few notable exceptions) who played by playing Catholic and Orthodox rulers and powers off each other, as well as balancing Catholic, Orthodox, and pagan internal politics. It's actually a fascinating example of excellent rulership and statecraft, particularly the accounts of Gediminas, Algirdas, and K\u0119stutis. After 1386 the pagan population was rapidly Christianized by the efforts of the rulers, and while some pagan superstitions and traditions survived for centuries afterwards, but it would be wrong to say the religion itself did.\n\n^1 One ruler, Mindaugas, converted to Catholicism in 1250ish and declared the Kingdom of Lithuania, but he was assassinated and his successors reverted to the old pagan Grand Duchy.", "id": "dak0nrr"}, {"comment": "\\\\1387.

Ensuring that people followed Catholic doctrine was not particularly practiced by the authorities until 12^th + centuries. Many people had more personal practices and beliefs which would have been influenced (or driven) by pagan ideology, even if it was *fundamentally* Catholic. Catholic doctrine started to become more uniform during this time, which is why there's a perceived increase in heretical sects (like the Lollards, Hussites, Waldensians etc. which were basically Christian, but were heretics because they rejected the authority of the Papacy or had doctrinal differences with Orthodox Christianity), but not really beforehand. That being said, there were specific cases of rulers trying to enforce Christianity, as with Charlemagne and the Saxons, but these weren't always successful or as influential as Charlemagne's attempts.\n\nEdit: there's not really a defined cut-off for seemingly large-scale pagan practice.

Soon after their arrival in England, the Anglo-Saxons likely converted (around 600 AD?). Clovis the King of the Franks (France, parts of Germany) converted to Christianity around 500 AD, as had many of the other Germanic rulers (Goths - Italy, Spain and Vandals - North Africa). The conversion of kings often led to the Chritianization of the Kingdom and hence further conversions by the King's subjects. Many kings continued to convert to Christianity into the first millennium AD around which time Northern Europe and the Vikings were finally brought under the fold. \n\nPaganism likely continued in secret for a bit longer but tended to be stamped out by the Kings and the Church. Also once the majority of Kings were Christian, it was pragmatic for a King to also convert since this would increase his chances of entering into alliances and make it more difficult for Christian Kings to use religion as an excuse to declare war. For example, Charlemagne was famous for declaring war on pagans and then force converting them once they were conquered.\n\nTo answer your question I would say around the turn of the first millennium, pagan pantheons no longer occupied a prominent direct role European society.", "id": "dakvouc"}], [{"comment": "Probably during the early middle ages.

I like the way Simon Schama told the story in [A History of Britain on the BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_History_of_Britain_(TV_series\\)).\n\nI tried to type out a TLDR, but it kept getting longer. Here's a very short summary. King Edward the Confessor of England died, with no heir. The Anglo-Saxon nobles elected his rich brother-in-law, Harold Godwinson, as the new king. But William of Normandy (the part of France that was settled by Vikings), Edward's bastard first cousin, claimed A) that Edward had promised him the throne, and B) that Harold had taken a sacred oath to support his claim. \n\nSo Harold knew that William was going to invade England during the summer of 1066. What he didn't know was that his own brother Tostig, who had been Earl of Northumbria (Northeastern England) until he was overthrown by his nobles and exiled by Edward, held a grudge against his brother. Tostig went to Norway and convinced King Harald Hardrada (\"Hard Council\", known to history buffs as the Last Viking) to invade England.\n\nHarold Godwinson put together an army and marched it to Southeastern England, to meet William's expected invasion. But the invasion never came. Finally, in the middle of September, Harold heard that his brother and Hardrada had invaded the North, defeated the English army there, and taken the City of York. So Harold marched his army more than 200 miles in 9 days, and met the Norwegian invaders at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25. The English caught them by surprise and routed the Norwegians. Apparently they had arrived on 30 ships, but sailed back in just 6 ships. Both Tostig and Harald Hardrada were killed.\n\nThree days later(!), William's invasion finally landed in Southeastern England. So Harold marched his army back to London, took a quick break, and then marched down to the coast, and met William at the Battle of Hastings on October 14. The battle lasted all day, the armies were evenly matched, but William, with the fresher army and more cavalry, won. Harold was killed. Most of the Anglo Saxon nobles were killed in the battle or aftermath.\n\nIn effect, the two biggest battles in the early history of England happened within a month of each other. Harold won the first battle, then lost the second battle with a weakened force. By the time it was over, there was basically no native nobility left in England, so William and his Norman nobles took over the whole country. It was the end of Anglo-Saxon England, and the beginning of the Anglo-Norman England of the High Middle Ages, which was largely defined by its rivalry with France. It's also the reason there are so many fruity French words in the English language.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of books that have been written on the subject, but it can be seen as the last, most impactful event in the Early Middle Ages of Western Europe. I don't know if it's as important as all that, but it's certainly the most talked about event in British history.\n\n/u/BerndtToast\n\n(please correct me if any of this is incorrect or incomplete!)

This was originally done to avoid the exact kind of bullshit that 1066 turned out to be. However, continental monarchies had matured and left Anglo-Saxon England in the post-Roman period. This meant that on continental Europe, the naming of an heir really did mean something, since other monarchies did not have the pseudo-democratic Witen system in place. So when the Witen did what it had always done, and chose the favorite to replace the childless king, the English were happy with the decision. \n\nThe rest of continental Europe, however, was infumed, since William had stated that the king had named *him* heir. This meant that, even if *none* of the Saxon nobles supported William, he still had the financial, political and military support of the entirety of continental Europe, at least to more a degree than Harold's England. So the war happened, and the English people were basically told, \"oh, by the way, you stay English, but your leadership is Norman now. Enjoy your ensuing overwhelming supply of rights, respect and good treatment!\"\n\n* *as an aside, the economy of England did improve significantly of William's rule*\n\nTostig, on the other hand, was actually living out one of the old Viking sagas. He had been, as far as he knew, deeply betrayed by Harold, and was seeking justice and revenge. Had he won, I have no doubt in my mind we would be reading Tostig's story as a \"late saga,\" which would end with his defeat by William. Yes, I have that much faith in William that I think he would have defeated Tostig just as he did Harold.\n\nThe word of a dead man is only as valuable as the swords of the living men who uphold that word. Power, influence and diplomacy means nothing if there isn't a big stick waiting at home. William understood this better than most, he had not had an easy life. He has a great story, I'm surprised there's no high quality HBO show about it.\n\nThat guy was a full on bad-ass in every way, and as far as I'm concerned, he deserved to conquer England. \n\nAs a side note, Aegon the Conqueror (Game of Thrones) is heavily based on William.\n\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror\n\nTL;DR William's claim had the legitimacy of being exclusively opposed by what Europe saw as a bunch of backwards hicks.

They are both mythical military leaders that seem to live up to their reputations. Although, in Aegon's case he was actually more like a minor noble that happened to be the only one left after Valyria (in this case, Normandy, I guess) essentially disappeared overnight.\n\nWho would be the Westerosi equivalents to Harold and Tostig, in this analogy, I wonder? I suppose Harold could be Robb and Tostig could be Theon?

All of GoT's characters have some kind of interesting real-world influence, but most of them stem from multiple people and events. Often, these people and events cross centuries. Actually, I find GoT to be a really interesting commentary on the \"patterns of civilization,\" as Martin tends to find similar events that took place hundreds of years (or miles) from each other and weave them together into one story, showing us that often, \"big events\" in history are like predictable reactions and patterns to social stress.\n\nIf you are interested in learning about some of the historical stories that inspire (and often surpass) the drama in GoT, I recommend checking out some of these events:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_England\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_Scottish_Independence\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_settlement_of_Britain\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchy\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Barons%27_War\n\n\nThere are so many other events in history that are full of life, colour and character, and many have interesting overlaps with GoT.

But the allies did the same. Giving military aid, promises for loans and consideration for new negotiations of turkish soil in the adreatic. Both sides practically bribing turkey with gifts and promises to join their cause.\n\nThe truth is that turkey was in no way capable of fighting another world war. They had a moderately big Navy mostly consisting of WW1 era cruiser ships and pre WW2 escorts. But nothing that could stand against the UK. Even combined with romania, they wouldn't have been able to contest the soviet unions black sea fleet.\n\nTheir airforce was up until the axis and allied gifts came completely obsolete and made out of biplanes. And there was no industry that could sustain a prolonged war.\n\nThis in the end led turkey to being neutral practically up until the point where gifts from either side stopped coming. From germany because they were completely depleted and had nothing to give and from the allies, simply because they didn't need turkey anymore.\nSo turkey declared on germany in 1944 to make good on some of those allied promises.

They encircled the 6th army in the city itself, and also scattered the 4th Panzer army that was supporting it. AGS was sent reeling for a good month, and was never able to break the encirclement. The 6th army was starved and trapped, and eventually surrendered en masse.\n\nA similar trick happened during the Battle of Moscow. The German units outside Moscow were so depleted and worn out that a massive Soviet counterattack reversed almost all their gains from the month before, and also trapped 2 German armies in a vulnerable salient near Rzhev. However, the Soviets were unable to complete the encirclement.\n\nThese were no magic tricks to the Stalingrad campaign, it was just an excellent set of strategic and operational plans. The Red army had been severely bloodied by Barbarossa, but its commanders had learned valuable lessons from their disaster. STAVKA had figured out which commanders were reliable, what to expect from Soviet offensives, and the strengths of the German military. 1942 was a difficult year, but it was largely a series of back-and-forth offensives rather than a clear advantage to either side. Stalingrad destroyed an enormous amount of German materiel, and the Nazis never recovered. Kursk isn't even a story, it was just a hopeless German failure."], [14, "The Japanese had been roundly trounced in the [Soviet-Japanese border wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_border_conflicts) of 1938-1939, so were less inclined to intervene, and were also facing a looming confrontation with America in the Pacific.\n\nStalingrad was more than a military victory. Hitler promised the German people again and again that Stalingrad would never fall, and then at the end of the battle that the German forces in Stalingrad would never surrender - shortly before this happened. So the word of the F\u00fchrer had publicly and embarrassingly been proven false, a heavy blow to morale in under a regime that emphasized the importance of the leader so much."], [27, "I came here expecting the standard 'the Soviets had huge numbers, used them mercilessly, and defeated the technologically superior Germans thanks to Hitler's blunders'-type answers.  These are grossly unhistorical and there is one or two.  But there are meany excellent answers thankfully (take a bow u/saltandvinegarrr; u/bangzadapp; u/OhNoTokyo).\n\nThe short answer is that while the Western powers were forced to surrender, or driven off Europe, before they could recover, Russia's *space* allowed the Red Army to recover. The Germans had big advantages in screwing every advantage from their weaponry, and they ran their economy at 110% in 1938-9 to arm it (as well as stripping the Czechs). Still, their army relied hugely on horses, their armoured vehicles were often improvisations and modernised, basically obsolete tanks.\n\nThe idea that they were technically superior is pure mythology, and is repeating the Nazi's own propaganda. The Red Army was highly mechanised and had much modern equipment in 1941, but it lacked battle experience and had suffered from the purges.  They of course lost much of this in the fighting and were pretty threadbare in winter 1941-2, where the quasi-myths about one rifle for ten men came out.  That winter *both* armies were running on nothing, two exhausted boxers swinging at each other.\n\nTo defend Stalingrad Stalin (who by then was letting his military commanders such as Zhukov and Chuikov run things, not his old political cronies like Timoshenko and Voroshilov) used a strict *economy of force*, leaking in just enough troops to hold the city and keep 6th Army tied down.  Meanwhile, Zhukov built up a large and well-equipped force to carry out the encirclement operation.\n\nIt was an operation of which any commander in history would have been proud, not a dumb bludgeoning of an enemy.\n\nKursk was similar. The Soviets held the initiative, their plan worked and the Germans' didn't.  The subsequent repeated hammer blows launched against the Wehrmacht, lesser known that the big set-piece battles, drove the Germans from the Ukraine with massive casualties. It was here the Soviets also took huge casualties, for the first time they were staging prolonged assaults against a Wehrmacht that was still very effective. But by repeatedly switching the point of attack they keep the Germans reeling.\n\nIn mid-1944 the Red Army completely walloped Army Group Centre, staging a surprise attack that routed hundreds of thousands of German units who *didn't even have a single Panzer division* in their order of battle.  Again, the Soviets were just learning to maintain the momentum of deep penetration operations and this was the only thing that stopped them. \n\nPostwar, the German commanders wrote a series of very self-serving memoirs that slated the blame for defeat to Hitler, and Westerners lapped it up.  The Germans couldn't quite stand to accept that the *untermensch* had defeated them, deceived them, out-fought and out-produced them.\n\nYes, they suffered big casualties, of course they did, as did Western armies that fought equivalent German units (though usually with air supremacy, strategic bomber support, naval gunfire support etc).  But this does not diminish their achievement."], [9, "I haven't seen a lot of answers that satisfy me so here is mine:\n\nThe idea by German High Command was that the Soviets had just gotten beaten badly by Finland and their officer corps was in shambles.  It was thought in 1941 that all that needed to be done was some early victories and the Soviet populace would rise up and overthrow Stalin and the Soviets would surrender.  Much like in WW1 when the Russians started shooting their own officers in protest of the war.\n\nThe original plan for Barbarossa was 14 weeks with a 2 week re-fit and re-org if I'm correct.  This was shortened to 12 weeks.\n\nThe Soviets had lost a lot of men during this operation but the Germans paid a very very steep price.  It's a myth to think the Soviets were just mindlessly running around dying without fighting back.  David Glantz has written pretty good books and has uncovered copies of the strategic and operational maneuvers of the Red Army.  Even all the way to Stalingrad in 1942 the Germans were beating back counterstrokes and taking heavy losses.  Most of the 6th Army didn't even make it to Stalingrad because they were wiped out on the way or bogged down in the surrounding areas.\n\nOne thing that helped the Soviets plan better maneuver is that Stalin let go a little and let the military handle military matters.  In the early years he got involved quite heavily.  In addition, he had just purged all his best officers in the 1930's so most of the command structure was new and terrified of being purged themselves.\n\nThe Soviets shot deserters and so did the Germans.  The Americans also executed a few soldiers for desertion but not on the scale as the Germans and Soviets.\n\nIn answer to your related question, Japan did not want to face the brunt of the Soviets because of what happened at Kalkin Ghal in the early part of the war.  Zhukov actually managed that operation and the Japanese forces present were basically annihilated.\n\nThere were a few factions within the Japanese command structure that wanted different objectives.  Some wanted to leave the majority of the Pacific out of it and consolidate their holdings in Asia.  Some wanted to fight the Soviets.  Some wanted to expand on islands and cripple the US and Australian presence in the Pacific.  That faction won out and then we had Pearl Harbor."], [3, "The German army was not equipped with enough winter clothes which killed and weakened them greatly. Stalin had spies in Japan and knew they were going to attack the US so he repurposed 40 divisions of elite Siberian soldiers that were waiting for a Japanese attack. These Siberians had skis and white coats and were instrumental in the Russian Victory.  "], [2, "[deleted]"], [2, "One does not simply walk to Moscow in the middle of winter! Ask Nepolean"], [2, "Excellent responses for the most part, lads. Today is a good day for r/history.\n\nImperial Japan experts are a bit thin on the ground, so excuse me for interjecting with specifics:\n\n---\n\nIn July 1941 the leadership of the Imperial Japanese Army called a conference to deliberate upon whether they should instigate a war with the Soviet Union. At the time Germany had won several operations along the border such as the Minsk encirclement, but was bogged down in back-and-forth trench warfare around Smolensk (Belarus) and Odessa (southern Ukraine). \n\nWhat happened next was a fascinating indictment of the Germans' pre-invasion 'planning' process. The Germans thought and were telling the Japanese that they had already destroyed half of the entire Red Army and that the war would be won within just a few months. Optimistic Japanese officers thought that the Germans might actually have destroyed a third of the Red Army. Realists thought it closer to a quarter.\n\nPessimists thought it was considerably less than that. \n\nThe conclusion was unanimous: the Soviet-German war would undoubtedly last for several years, and Germany would probably lose. Moreover, if Japan joined Germany then she would lose with her. \n\n---\n\nAddendum: given the numbers of Japanese horses and trucks, and the permanent commitment of horses and trucks to support 100k first-rate combat troops in China, a Japanese deployment could not exceed 400k first-rate combat troops in the Soviet-Manchurian borderlands. The Soviet Far Eastern Military District never had fewer than 500k combat troops massed on the Soviet-Manchurian border.\n\nIn the Soviet interior, the size of both forces would be largely reliant upon the capacity of the Trans-siberian railroad given the shortage of navigable rivers (and their absence in winter) and the sheer distance from other lines. This meant that both sides could field about 200k combat troops at most. \n\nTo put all this into perspective, the Soviets never fielded fewer than 3 million combat troops in the eastern European theatre of war at any point after June 1941. \n\nSpatially, bear in mind that the distance between Warsaw and Stalingrad was 2000km, about the same distance as between the railway hub at Harbin and the easternmost Soviet industrial center in Siberia, Irkutsk. \n\nIt was another 2000km from Irkutsk to where Soviet industry started becoming important, at Omsk."], [2, "The USSR victory of Nazi Germany had more to do with Germany's failures than Soviet military success. \n\nSome quick pointers\n\n1. The Soviet war machine out produced the Nazi War machine. They could build and replace almost every better and faster.  However much of this has to do with the fact that Germany's resources were tied up fighting the other allies, managing the holocaust and managing the great air war that devastated Germany manufacturing. This gave the Soviets Leverage of Nazi Germany.\n\n2. The Soviet Union HAD to defeat Nazi Germany, had they came to an armacist or short term peace settlement this would have been simply a pause in a perpetual conflict. Stalin and the rest of the communists knew that the security of the USSR depended on defeating Hitler in absolute. \n\n3. Nazi Strategies in defeating the USSR had too many objectives to achieve in a short period of time. When the Moscow offensive stalled the Nazi's decided to swing south to capture Baku and were forced into Stalingrad. The Germans were ill equipped to take on another objective After Moscow, with a reinforced Soviet Army failure was immenent. What the Germans should have done after the failure of Moscow was consolidate their gains and begin a more defensive strategy until the time was right for another offensive. \n\n4. The Nazi air force was neutralized in the USSR. What had afforded the Nazis so many early victories was their effective use of fighters and bombers.  On the Eastern Front Germany needed not only fighters but long range bombers to reach the Ural factories, there was no long range Nazi bomber and this was never realized. "], [2, "It wasn't Stalingrad that changed the war. The battle was just the first major defeat for Germany. Kursk turned the course of the war. After this battle the Germans were unable to launch any major offensives and the red army pretty much just slowly drove them away."], [2, "The German army made their front line way to thin, and the armies in Stalingrad pushed way to in, and were cut off from the rest of the German forces. Essentially, the Soviets just flanked on both sides and surrounded them, killing off a huge bulk and making the Germans waste a lot of resources on a lost battle. From there, they just pushed through with superior numbers. Remember the Soviets lost around 20 million men. "], [7, "I once heard a probably apocryphal story about the early-war period when Germany and the Soviet Union were still allies. During the invasion of Poland, when the Germans attacked from the west and the Russians invaded from the east, a German and Russian unit encountered each other. After tense but pleasant greetings, the commanders shared a drink. The German officer was a Prussian graduate of staff and war college with generations of military tradition in his family. The Russian counterpart was the son of a peasant, product of a short college-level officer course, and selected for party loyalty rather than ability. The German troops were smart-looking Teutonic soldiers in half-tracks and Panzers, while the Soviet troops were ethnically mixed, wearing simple uniforms, carrying old weapons, and mostly on foot, with horse-drawn artillery and supply wagons. The German make some tactless remarks like, \"Let's hope we never have to fight each other, because I think my soldiers are far superior to yours.\" \nThe Russian looked him in the eye and said simply: \"Nas mnoga.\" \"We are many.\" \n\nThat's how.

The Russian winter is certainly an important one. I think the speed of the German advance made them over confident. They were making progress so quickly that they didn't stop when winter came. Next thing they know, they're deep in Russia and it's getting cold. As far as I understand it, the speed of their advance made it difficult for supply lines to keep up. Additionally, as Russian soldiers retreated they would burn fields behind them, reducing the ability of Germans to survive by plundering the land. Being stuck in extreme conditions with little resources weakened the Germans and helped the Russian counter attack. \n\nThere's also what others have said, that Russia had huge numbers. Peasants were being conscripted en masse and thrown at the Germans. The government didn't really seem to care what casualties were like, as long as they made progress. \n\nFinally, as in World War I, Germany was fighting a two-front war. That's extremely taxing, even on a nation like Germany. By the end of the war, goods of all kinds were being rationed in Germany. The military was conscripting men older and younger than ever before. Germany was good at the Blitzkrieg and less suited to the drawn-out war of attrition. With the Brits and fresh-faced Americans pounding at you from the west, the Russians storming in from the east, a tired and dwindling military, and shortages of goods, the odds were stacked against them. \n\nI think those factors help explain how Russia was able to defeat Germany. I'm totally open to elaborations or even corrections from others. \n\nSource, in case you're interested, is that I'm a semester from my history BA and the 20th Century is one of my primary interests.

These are grossly unhistorical and there is one or two.  But there are meany excellent answers thankfully (take a bow u/saltandvinegarrr; u/bangzadapp; u/OhNoTokyo).\n\nThe short answer is that while the Western powers were forced to surrender, or driven off Europe, before they could recover, Russia's *space* allowed the Red Army to recover. The Germans had big advantages in screwing every advantage from their weaponry, and they ran their economy at 110% in 1938-9 to arm it (as well as stripping the Czechs). Still, their army relied hugely on horses, their armoured vehicles were often improvisations and modernised, basically obsolete tanks.\n\nThe idea that they were technically superior is pure mythology, and is repeating the Nazi's own propaganda. The Red Army was highly mechanised and had much modern equipment in 1941, but it lacked battle experience and had suffered from the purges.  They of course lost much of this in the fighting and were pretty threadbare in winter 1941-2, where the quasi-myths about one rifle for ten men came out.  That winter *both* armies were running on nothing, two exhausted boxers swinging at each other.\n\nTo defend Stalingrad Stalin (who by then was letting his military commanders such as Zhukov and Chuikov run things, not his old political cronies like Timoshenko and Voroshilov) used a strict *economy of force*, leaking in just enough troops to hold the city and keep 6th Army tied down.  Meanwhile, Zhukov built up a large and well-equipped force to carry out the encirclement operation.\n\nIt was an operation of which any commander in history would have been proud, not a dumb bludgeoning of an enemy.\n\nKursk was similar. The Soviets held the initiative, their plan worked and the Germans' didn't.  The subsequent repeated hammer blows launched against the Wehrmacht, lesser known that the big set-piece battles, drove the Germans from the Ukraine with massive casualties. It was here the Soviets also took huge casualties, for the first time they were staging prolonged assaults against a Wehrmacht that was still very effective. But by repeatedly switching the point of attack they keep the Germans reeling.\n\nIn mid-1944 the Red Army completely walloped Army Group Centre, staging a surprise attack that routed hundreds of thousands of German units who *didn't even have a single Panzer division* in their order of battle.  Again, the Soviets were just learning to maintain the momentum of deep penetration operations and this was the only thing that stopped them. \n\nPostwar, the German commanders wrote a series of very self-serving memoirs that slated the blame for defeat to Hitler, and Westerners lapped it up.  The Germans couldn't quite stand to accept that the *untermensch* had defeated them, deceived them, out-fought and out-produced them.\n\nYes, they suffered big casualties, of course they did, as did Western armies that fought equivalent German units (though usually with air supremacy, strategic bomber support, naval gunfire support etc).

Any other power save the USA simply would not have been able to sustain the numbers of casualties the Soviets suffered. The only clearly wrong part is the technological superiority bit (they invaded using horses FFS).\n\nI would add two things to your explanation. The Soviets recovered their morale. This was noted around the time of Stalingrad - Ni Shogu Nazad was almost a kind of collective psychological shift in the Red Army. The level of resistance the Soviet military and people was willing to offer exploded after 1941. It became fanatical.\n\nSecondly, the leadership culture moved away from (I'm going to butcher the term) something called obshchina - leaders running the military and state in a way to avoid personal culpability. This was a *major* cause for early war blunders. Soviet leaders were unwilling to do things without orders from above and would follow said orders even if it was clearly a bad course of action in the real world. It was a product of Stalin's purges and a major contributor to the massive disasters of 1941. Millions of soldiers got encircled because of this, and it was a major contributor to the destruction of the PVO. Later in the war, the USSR adapted a leadership style similar to Auftragstaktik - aggressive leadership from the front focused on achieving objectives with less centralized control.

It was thought in 1941 that all that needed to be done was some early victories and the Soviet populace would rise up and overthrow Stalin and the Soviets would surrender.  Much like in WW1 when the Russians started shooting their own officers in protest of the war.\n\nThe original plan for Barbarossa was 14 weeks with a 2 week re-fit and re-org if I'm correct.  This was shortened to 12 weeks.\n\nThe Soviets had lost a lot of men during this operation but the Germans paid a very very steep price.  It's a myth to think the Soviets were just mindlessly running around dying without fighting back.  David Glantz has written pretty good books and has uncovered copies of the strategic and operational maneuvers of the Red Army.  Even all the way to Stalingrad in 1942 the Germans were beating back counterstrokes and taking heavy losses.  Most of the 6th Army didn't even make it to Stalingrad because they were wiped out on the way or bogged down in the surrounding areas.\n\nOne thing that helped the Soviets plan better maneuver is that Stalin let go a little and let the military handle military matters.  In the early years he got involved quite heavily.  In addition, he had just purged all his best officers in the 1930's so most of the command structure was new and terrified of being purged themselves.\n\nThe Soviets shot deserters and so did the Germans.  The Americans also executed a few soldiers for desertion but not on the scale as the Germans and Soviets.\n\nIn answer to your related question, Japan did not want to face the brunt of the Soviets because of what happened at Kalkin Ghal in the early part of the war.  Zhukov actually managed that operation and the Japanese forces present were basically annihilated.\n\nThere were a few factions within the Japanese command structure that wanted different objectives.  Some wanted to leave the majority of the Pacific out of it and consolidate their holdings in Asia.  Some wanted to fight the Soviets.  Some wanted to expand on islands and cripple the US and Australian presence in the Pacific.

The Soviet Union was in complete turmoil.  Stalin was hated and they tried to kick him out of office.  In retaliation for this, he did his purges.

Finland fought with the Soviets and completely embarrassed the Soviet Union in front of the entire world.  Stalin had perpetrated the mass starvation in the Ukraine.

It was the battles of Khalkhin Gol.  Keep in mind that the German \"Blitzkrieg\" (which is a myth, but a different topic) was actually a Russian idea called \"deep battle\" from 1920 and the Germans learned it while doing field exercises in the Soviet Union in the 1920's and 1930's.\n\nThe Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor because the United States had cut off their rubber, oil, and financial assets.  The United States was a weak 2nd-rate power militarily.  The total armed forces at that time was nothing.  Japan predicted that a knockout blow to the fleet would cripple the US in the region and Japan could do what it wanted to.

With their access to strategic resources cut by the Americans, they needed to find a way to supply themselves.

With the embargo, the US effectively herded Japanese military intentions to the south, while holding what they felt was an ace in the form of Dougie Mac in the Philippines. \n\nUnder the Washington Naval Treaty, the US held a paper advantage in naval tonnage.

That meant that they couldn't just bypass the Philippines, and that the US would indeed enact Plan Orange.\n\nThe Japanese plan to counter the expected American thrust is seen in their technological and tactical choices. They favored long range torpedoes and night attacks by smaller craft. The idea was that they would take pot shots at the US fleet as they sailed across the Pacific, a war of attrition that would weaken the fleet to the point where the Japanese could land a decisive blow.\n\nThe deviation from the plan came as a result of an innovative naval officer applying the lessons learned from the British raid on Taranto to the threat that FDR tried to show them. Moving the US fleet from San Diego to Hawaii put it within reach of Japan's naval aviation force (who themselves were sporting highly secretive new aircraft types).

At the time Germany had won several operations along the border such as the Minsk encirclement, but was bogged down in back-and-forth trench warfare around Smolensk (Belarus) and Odessa (southern Ukraine). \n\nWhat happened next was a fascinating indictment of the Germans' pre-invasion 'planning' process.

So in one sense, this means that quantity wins the battle, but it isn't infantry strength that I am talking about. Combat multipliers such as training, tank equipment, submachine guns, artillery concentration: these matter. By drastically outproducing Germany with the PPsh machine gun, the T-34 medium tank, the IL ground attack aircraft, etc., the Soviets were able to smash the Wehrmacht from 1944-45, often despite being either outnumbered or on parity in terms of pure infantry numbers. \n\n\n**German Strength**: Let's admit that up until Stalingrad the Wehrmacht was a cut above its rivals, but this was less due to next generation equipment, and more to do with tactics, training, combined-arms operations and morale.

Later in the war, from Kursk to Bagration, Jassy and Berlin, you would similarly see large numbers of German infantry units overwhelmed by Red Army tanks, aircraft, and artillery, nor mere bayonet charges. Also, it will probably be genuinely surprising for anyone not an *Axis & Allies* boardgame player to learn that the post-1943 Red Army armed the infantry with far more submachine guns at the lowest platoon level than all other militaries of the time.

After the bombs and Manchuria the Japanese surrender was unconditional, Japans emperor staying on in a ceremonial role was Americas decision, not Japans.\n\nJapan had just put up a very bloody defence on Okinawa, the same and worse was expected on the Japanese main islands.\n\n\n\nOn April 1, 12 days before Truman became president, the United States invaded Okinawa, located just 350 miles (560 km) south of the Japanese home island of Kyushu. The battle of Okinawa was one of the fiercest of the Pacific war. The small island was defended by 100,000 Japanese troops, and Japanese military leaders attempted\u2014with some success\u2014to mobilize the island\u2019s entire civilian population. Offshore, Japanese kamikaze planes inflicted severe losses on the American fleet. After nearly 12 weeks of fighting, the United States secured the island on June 21 at a cost of nearly 50,000 American casualties. Japanese casualties were staggering, with approximately 90,000 defending troops and at least 100,000 civilians killed.\n\nThe Americans considered Okinawa a dress rehearsal for the invasion of the Japanese home islands, for which the United States was finalizing a two-stage plan. The first phase, code-named Olympic, was scheduled for late October 1945, with a landing on Kyushu, defended by an estimated 350,000 Japanese troops backed by at least 1,000 kamikaze planes. Olympic entailed the use of nearly 800,000 American assault troops and an enormous naval fleet. The scale of the operation was to be similar to that of the Normandy invasion in France in June 1944, which involved 156,000 Allied troops in the first 24 hours and approximately 850,000 others by the end of the first week of July. Estimates of casualties from an invasion of Japan varied, but nearly everyone involved in the planning assumed that they would be substantial; mid-range estimates projected 132,000 American casualties, with 40,000 deaths. Truman told his military advisers that he hoped \u201cthere was a possibility of preventing an Okinawa from one end of Japan to another.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe second phase of the plan, code-named Coronet, envisioned a landing near Tokyo on the home island of Honshu in the spring of 1946 and a Japanese surrender sometime before the end of the year. The same mid-range estimate that predicted 132,000 casualties for Olympic projected 90,000 for Coronet. If both invasions were necessary, by the most conservative estimates the United States would suffer 100,000 killed, wounded, or missing, as compared to a Pacific War total that by mid-June was approaching 170,000. Thus, the best estimates available to Truman predicted that the war would continue for a year or longer and that casualties would increase by 60 to 100 percent or more.\n\n\nThe \"discrete channels\" were mainly the Soviets, and Japan initially even tried to keep all the territory they had conquered, their belated attempts at diplomacy were a complete shambles.\n\n\nAmerica in general wanted an unconditional surrender, this was not solely Trumans wish or doing.\nThe Soviet Unions invasion of Manchuria occured after the bombs had been dropped, and America had been urging the Soviet Union to attack Japan much sooner at least since the Yalta conference.\n\nMany people had their doubts, or alternative plans and opinions at the time, that does not automatically mean the final decision was a bad one. In July 1945 project administrators polled 150 of the 300 scientists working at the Chicago site and could find only 19 who rejected any military use of the bomb and another 39 who supported an experimental demonstration with representatives of Japan present, followed by an opportunity for surrender. Most of the scientists, however, supported some use of the bomb: 23 supported using it in a way that was militarily \u201cmost effective,\u201d and 69 opted for a \u201cmilitary demonstration in Japan\u201d with an opportunity for surrender \u201cbefore full use of the weapons.\u201d In later years, several key figures, including General Dwight D.

Harry Truman considered the nuclear bombs as simply that, bombs and weapons to be used against the enemy of the United States. It wasn't until afterword when people realized the devastating power of the weapons that people came up with more moral (or politically motivated) justifications. \n\n"]], [[{"comment": "I would say most of the points you mentioned are either arguably false, hearsay or extreme oversimplifications of the matter. \"The Japanese\" were not a monolithic entity, there were several factions in Japan, each with their own agenda. After the bombs and Manchuria the Japanese surrender was unconditional, Japans emperor staying on in a ceremonial role was Americas decision, not Japans.\n\nJapan had just put up a very bloody defence on Okinawa, the same and worse was expected on the Japanese main islands.\n\n\n\nOn April 1, 12 days before Truman became president, the United States invaded Okinawa, located just 350 miles (560 km) south of the Japanese home island of Kyushu. The battle of Okinawa was one of the fiercest of the Pacific war. The small island was defended by 100,000 Japanese troops, and Japanese military leaders attempted\u2014with some success\u2014to mobilize the island\u2019s entire civilian population. Offshore, Japanese kamikaze planes inflicted severe losses on the American fleet. After nearly 12 weeks of fighting, the United States secured the island on June 21 at a cost of nearly 50,000 American casualties. Japanese casualties were staggering, with approximately 90,000 defending troops and at least 100,000 civilians killed.\n\nThe Americans considered Okinawa a dress rehearsal for the invasion of the Japanese home islands, for which the United States was finalizing a two-stage plan. The first phase, code-named Olympic, was scheduled for late October 1945, with a landing on Kyushu, defended by an estimated 350,000 Japanese troops backed by at least 1,000 kamikaze planes. Olympic entailed the use of nearly 800,000 American assault troops and an enormous naval fleet. The scale of the operation was to be similar to that of the Normandy invasion in France in June 1944, which involved 156,000 Allied troops in the first 24 hours and approximately 850,000 others by the end of the first week of July. Estimates of casualties from an invasion of Japan varied, but nearly everyone involved in the planning assumed that they would be substantial; mid-range estimates projected 132,000 American casualties, with 40,000 deaths. Truman told his military advisers that he hoped \u201cthere was a possibility of preventing an Okinawa from one end of Japan to another.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe second phase of the plan, code-named Coronet, envisioned a landing near Tokyo on the home island of Honshu in the spring of 1946 and a Japanese surrender sometime before the end of the year. The same mid-range estimate that predicted 132,000 casualties for Olympic projected 90,000 for Coronet. If both invasions were necessary, by the most conservative estimates the United States would suffer 100,000 killed, wounded, or missing, as compared to a Pacific War total that by mid-June was approaching 170,000.

Austria-Hungary and Italy shared a very narrow, mountainous border. Similarly, the Vosges mountains in Alsace-Lorraine just north of Switzerland limited large offensive actions to a relatively short front line of ~400 km.

First and foremost was the change in infantry tactics.

Napoleonic style infantry tactics with men standing shoulder to shoulder made up in mass fire what the muskets lacked in accuracy.\n\nThen came the minie ball fed into a rifled musket that greatly increased the accuracy of the average Civil War infantryman. By the end of the Civil War we had seen the development of trench warfare used in the sieges of Vicksburg and Petersburg to minimize the effects of more accurate rifled muskets.\n\nThese developments continued into WW I, where machine guns and massed artillery made field fortifications even more necessary.\n\nDuring the period between the world wars, infantry tactics evolved to handle machine guns and field fortifications. Instead of mass charges into the teeth of a field fortification with a machine gun, infantry would maneuver in relatively small units (squad to platoon size units were often ideal). One part of the unit would lay down a base of fire to keep the fortification busy, while another maneuver element would move outside the enemy's field of fire to take the fortification or machine gun nest from the side or rear. \n\nAlso, you must remember that World War II was the age of Blitzkrieg, where the Germans defeated that greatest of all field fortifications, the Maginot Line, by flanking it on its north end with fast-moving tank and mechanized infantry units.

By the end of the Civil War we had seen the development of trench warfare used in the sieges of Vicksburg and Petersburg to minimize the effects of more accurate rifled muskets.\n\nThese developments continued into WW I, where machine guns and massed artillery made field fortifications even more necessary.\n\nDuring the period between the world wars, infantry tactics evolved to handle machine guns and field fortifications. Instead of mass charges into the teeth of a field fortification with a machine gun, infantry would maneuver in relatively small units (squad to platoon size units were often ideal). One part of the unit would lay down a base of fire to keep the fortification busy, while another maneuver element would move outside the enemy's field of fire to take the fortification or machine gun nest from the side or rear. \n\nAlso, you must remember that World War II was the age of Blitzkrieg, where the Germans defeated that greatest of all field fortifications, the Maginot Line, by flanking it on its north end with fast-moving tank and mechanized infantry units. In addition, close air support had evolved into something far more deadly to troops in field fortifications than had been the case in WW I.", "id": "darbbbw"}], [{"comment": "In my humble opinion...

Windows were also very narrow to protect from deadly sand storms that could tear your skin off.\n\nNow, in the summer, the climate on the island can go as high as over 50-60\u00ba Celsius (140\u00baF) during the day.

Destruction not only functions as a game mechanic but really shows just how obliterated battlefields became in WWI.\n\nEvents wise BF1 does a good job at setting up the battles and offensive it portrays, the best examples of this is the operations mode in multiplayer where players work through multiple maps in a campaign-like offensive.\n\nHonestly the biggest inaccuracy in the game is how people play it. They run around like idiots, never take cover... t-bag. \n\nPeople criticize the game for putting too many SMGs and not showing enough trench warfare etc. But when you're storming the Saint Quentin scar trench line as a German Sturmtroopen with an MP-18 while artillery is blowing everything to shreds as you push for the Amien railroad in 1918. It gets pretty close to reality, because the Stormtroops really did use the MP-18 (especially in that offensive) and they were the ones punching through the British sectors and many MANY lives were lost in the process. I mean a typical operations matches sees minimum of 750+ people killed.\n\nThe Codex pages are also written by the people over at The Great War channel and are great mini-doses of information about weapons and events during WWI.\n\nAgain, its gets really inaccurate when people don't play it right which unfortunately is most of the time. Also it's still a game, it still has plenty of nonsensical mechanics. people in WWI weren't instantly revived by a syringe obviously.\n\nIf you're into more historical comparisons I'd recommend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSU2B-Ic5fI"]], [[{"comment": "BF1 is a WWI-themed shooter that essentially plays like the virtual representations of WWII did.

Destruction not only functions as a game mechanic but really shows just how obliterated battlefields became in WWI.\n\nEvents wise BF1 does a good job at setting up the battles and offensive it portrays, the best examples of this is the operations mode in multiplayer where players work through multiple maps in a campaign-like offensive.\n\nHonestly the biggest inaccuracy in the game is how people play it. They run around like idiots, never take cover... t-bag. \n\nPeople criticize the game for putting too many SMGs and not showing enough trench warfare etc. But when you're storming the Saint Quentin scar trench line as a German Sturmtroopen with an MP-18 while artillery is blowing everything to shreds as you push for the Amien railroad in 1918. It gets pretty close to reality, because the Stormtroops really did use the MP-18 (especially in that offensive) and they were the ones punching through the British sectors and many MANY lives were lost in the process. I mean a typical operations matches sees minimum of 750+ people killed.\n\nThe Codex pages are also written by the people over at The Great War channel and are great mini-doses of information about weapons and events during WWI.\n\nAgain, its gets really inaccurate when people don't play it right which unfortunately is most of the time. Also it's still a game, it still has plenty of nonsensical mechanics. people in WWI weren't instantly revived by a syringe obviously.\n\nIf you're into more historical comparisons I'd recommend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSU2B-Ic5fI", "id": "dar8wv3"}]]], "5g4ong": ["What are examples of women dressing up as men during history?", "2016-12-02 20:59:06", 11, "https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/5g4ong/what_are_examples_of_women_dressing_up_as_men/", [[3, "In 1810, 52 year old Marshal Massena arrived in Spain tasked with removing the Anglo-Portuguese army under Wellington from the peninsula.

Also BEP and Qgyh2 are *people* who couldn't mod their way out of a paper bag if their lives depended upon it.  \n\nSo that said, as a mod of /r/PoliticalDiscussion (among other places) I have often dealt with accusations of bias over years.
