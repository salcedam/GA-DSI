The nearby theatre over the last few years has redone their food menu, taken out their ALREADY SUPERIOR stadium seats and put in much bigger, more comfortable, reclining seats with 5 solid feet of leg room between each row and assigned seats which you can reserve ahead of time.  They added a bar for adults, and a new menu of edible food.  In response people flock from all the surrounding communities to go there, the experience is amazing.  Best part?  You can get tickets from many locations for this place for $8.75 a peice, and they did not increase their ticket prices after any of these changes.

Years ago when I started attending this theatre I would choose one of the many free popcorn flavors they have available in the lobby, and I thought out loud to a nearby employee \"It is too bad they don't use buckets with a large protruding plastic lid so that visitors could shake their chosen flavor of powder all throughout\".

All the people commenting about economic cost and somehow the willingness to pay being # of people x (ticket cost + popcorn cost) + gas cost are correct about the demand side perhaps but forget that on the supply side there's a thing called piracy. So I think studios would need to weigh their cost/benefit and ultimately come out with a product that competes with pirated copies. For example I would be willing to pay $5-10 for watching it early 1-2 days, having a very good quality copy, saving the time to pirate it, and knowing I supported the studio. But that's it; there is no willingness to spend $50 on a movie I wasn't going to watch in the threaters in the first 2 weeks anyways.\n\n"]], [[{"comment": "This could be great for smaller films.

The nearby theatre over the last few years has redone their food menu, taken out their ALREADY SUPERIOR stadium seats and put in much bigger, more comfortable, reclining seats with 5 solid feet of leg room between each row and assigned seats which you can reserve ahead of time.

You can get tickets from many locations for this place for $8.75 a peice, and they did not increase their ticket prices after any of these changes.

All the people commenting about economic cost and somehow the willingness to pay being # of people x (ticket cost + popcorn cost) + gas cost are correct about the demand side perhaps but forget that on the supply side there's a thing called piracy. So I think studios would need to weigh their cost/benefit and ultimately come out with a product that competes with pirated copies. For example I would be willing to pay $5-10 for watching it early 1-2 days, having a very good quality copy, saving the time to pirate it, and knowing I supported the studio.

If you look at the wording the compliant is about \"yet another journey of White male discovery.\" \n\nBut the novel itself is a series of novels written by a Japanese man trying to discover his place in the world as a Japanese Christian, an outsider in both Japan and the West. As you picked up on, the novel is largely a framing device to explore the alienation Endo felt and all of the characters speak with his doubts and fears and with the entire country of Japan standing in as his mental landscape. The novel isn't really a journey of self discovery, at the end he lives a rather shallow and unfulfilled life wracked with self hatred and loathing. Which seems to match what Endo struggled with all his life. Dunno if the film changes that, haven't seen it. \n\nComplaints about representation aren't really about  the work itself but are largely about the lack of minorities in media, both in the present day and in history.

I find myself watching it around Halloween every year, it just seems to fit the mood.  \nRashomon is probably one of his most influential films from a film making/writing perspective. It has elements of perspective, uncertainty of narration (*is* this an unreliable narrator?), and courtroom drama.  \nI would also recommend Kenji Mizoguchi as a director. His films are more serious and heartbreaking than some of Kurosawa's films which, while often serious, had humorous elements. I would recommend Ugetsu, Street of Shame, and my favorite: The Life of Oharu, though his other works are quite good as well.  \n\nEdit to add: If you want to see a fantastic modern Japanese film that is the spiritual recreation of The Life of Oharu, watch Memories of Matsuko.

Two, there are rumors that he doesn't like to work with musicians that have had formal training in music composition. How would you feel if you spent all that tuition money for USC to have someone tell you that because of it you can't \"think outside of the box.\" Three, he does have a large team around him. Nowadays he's more of a producer that oversees that actual composition process from a bunch of people. \n\nEven though I feel this way because of the reasons above, I will never downvote or think badly of someone for liking Zimmer.

Zimmerman Zimmer doesn't have an obligation to use orchestras or work with certain people.\n\nHe doesn't, but he can be criticised for perpetuating a deliberately Luddite attitude towards composition.\n\n-Disclaimer, I spent a year learning theory at music college, so I may well be biased-\n\nWhen Zimmer says he doesn't like to work with musicians who have had training because they can't think outside the box, he's displaying a typically anti-intellectual mindset that has no actual basis. Learning the theory of music, how semitones and tones form modes and scales, how chords can be extended from three notes to four, to five, to six, how rhythms can be pushed and pulled and can work in circles with each other... that does *not* box you in, and anyone who claims it does is wrong. Learning music theory doesn't stop you from trying new things, it simply allows you to *explain how and why you did the new thing that you just did*. \n\nWhen someone with the prominence and reach that Zimmer has starts promoting myths about music theory and music training, that has an effect. It means trained musicians start getting less work. It means talented composers who have spent their lives perfecting their ear are forced into producing repetitive drudge. It means the composition of film scores is no longer treated as its own artform, and is instead treated like a [mass-consumer factory production line.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Control_Productions)\n\nLook at it this way: If Hans Zimmer's ideas are true, and formally trained musicians are more confined inside their boxes, then why do so many of his 'informal' soundtracks so interchangeable, yet a formally trained composer like Mozart was so ridiculously creative and inventive throughout his entire career?

It'll be an involved process, where different melodies are arranged to fit different actions and scenes on the screen, and where your knowledge of scales, chords and rhythm will be what defines how you shape the score, and in part shape the audience's reaction. The decision to go with a major-key progression or a minor-key one may end up being the one thing that defines whether the audience feel uplifted watching a scene, or feel overwhelmed with sadness. \n\n Hans Zimmer's process is to sketch up a few rough ideas on his computer, usually revolving around a repeating motif that gets louder and louder regardless of what is actually happening on screen, then pass it onto one of his production underlings to do all the heavy lifting on. The problem here is that by treating the score as a factory assembly line, he's completely missing all the intricacy that comes from treating it as an art. For example: If a John Williams score has a sequence where it modulates from an F-G-Am sequence to a G#-A#-Bm sequence, you can be certain that not only is there a specific reason for why Williams put that modulation there, but also that he composed it to match up exactly with an action happening on the screen.\n\n That sort of thing doesn't happen using Zimmer's process. You get Zimmer composing a song largely devoid of matching music to moment, then you pass that song onto someone else to turn into an actual score, and that someone has no idea about the feelings or expression that went into the music in the first place. \n\n It's the difference between a production-line Ford and a boutique Pagani.

Instead of hiring orchestras -- and writing complex orchestration for them -- you now had these younger composers who grew up on computers whipping out a synthesized score for a fraction of a budget. This was very appealing to movie studios, and it had a transformative effect on how movie scores were written and how they sounded.\n\nThere are still many composers who write music in a classical style.

If you listen to something like the Star Wars theme, with all its intricate horn blasts and interlocking melody lines, that's the sort of music that takes a while to adequately draft, arrange and orchestrate. If you're writing melodic themes for an entire orchestra, and each section has their own intricate part to play, then it simply takes a bit longer to get those parts written out and perfected.\n\nCompare that to what Zimmer does, namely having orchestras play block chords in steady, repeating structures. It's effective, it doesn't take as much time to produce, and it means studios can hire a composer much later in the process for a fraction of the cost. Rather than having to get the composer involved early in pre-production, you can hire them well into the post-production phase, and if you don't like them, change them out last minute for someone else.

I thought Inside Out was great btw, but it's certainly a very accessible film. \n\nDisney is the biggest because they make movies to appeal to the largest audience possible, which was my whole point. They would never do anything that might even possibly turn anyone off, thus you get very well made but ultimately safe and predictable films. They're certainly not the best because of the quality of their work which is incredibly formulaic. Zootopia was beautifully animated (if somewhat generically stylized) but it had all the depth of an after school special.\n\nMiyazaki created much more emotionally complex and richly animated and stylized works, filled with danger, horror, sadness and beauty, children's movies that are beloved by kids and adults alike, without ever having to pander to the audience or retread well worn plot devices. Obviously it's not a necessity to make movies as safely as Disney does in order to create beloved classics. Hell, even a very simple film like My Neighbor Totoro where next to nothing dramatic happens feels less constrained creatively by trying to please everyone than your average Disney film. So many Disney movies seem like they are polished to the point of losing any soul they might have had, almost as if they're built from the ground up around audience's expectations as opposed to truly having a spark of creativity and going from there. The bottom line of money over artistic expression will always give us the solid mediocrity of the MCU or the new Star Wars over any truly daring vision. Again, not bad.

For most of Hollywood history, a more subjectively-oriented style of camerawork and editing (subjective as in, motivated by the psychology/subjectivity of whatever character is in focus. Think Kuleshov effect) has been utilized. Most of Hitchcock's films are constructed this way, for example.\n\nThe idea of treating the camera as more of a window, and composing each image from a classic art/photography standpoint, reflects a different perspective of film theory that is not necessarily detached from character, but does not work to immerse the audience in a character the way most films are designed to. This leaves the viewer free to focus on whichever elements of production catch their attention.

In other words, he has the acting ability and formative films (The Pianist, for example) that could have been the foundation of an esteemed film career as a character actor along the lines of Phillip Seymour Hoffman or John Cazale, whose non-leading man looks they accepted and leveraged into phenomenal immersions into characters. \n\nApparently, from a number of interviews and just looking at his choice of films after his early movies, it's clear that this tack was not the one Brody was satisfied to take - he wanted to be the leading man, the star, the one man show, and when he wasn't getting these roles in the high-end movies he wanted to be in, he started taking the lead role in less esteemed films (with lessor directors, that were less highly anticipated, and/or that had poorer casting) just to get the lead role. Eventually, this diluted perceptions of him as an A-list actor, and his career went into the toilet, as he couldn't even get those high-quality supporting roles because his real talent had been forgotten or overshadowed by his ego-driven choices. \n\nAnyway.

In other words, he has the acting ability and formative films (The Pianist, for example) that could have been the foundation of an esteemed film career as a character actor along the lines of Phillip Seymour Hoffman or John Cazale, whose non-leading man looks they accepted and leveraged into phenomenal immersions into characters. \n\nApparently, from a number of interviews and just looking at his choice of films after his early movies, it's clear that this tack was not the one Brody was satisfied to take - he wanted to be the leading man, the star, the one man show, and when he wasn't getting these roles in the high-end movies he wanted to be in, he started taking the lead role in less esteemed films (with lessor directors, that were less highly anticipated, and/or that had poorer casting) just to get the lead role. Eventually, this diluted perceptions of him as an A-list actor, and his career went into the toilet, as he couldn't even get those high-quality supporting roles because his real talent had been forgotten or overshadowed by his ego-driven choices. \n\nAnyway.

In A Clockwork Orange, the main character is absolutely despicable: selfish, violent, and a serial rapist. Virtually no one in ACO is portrayed in a positive light, which is certainly uncommon in a feature length big-budget film.\n\nIt's not that directors and actors don't want to make this type of movie now. I think it's more that these types of movies are not funded because studios and producers know they can make WAY more money by making yet another Spiderman or Bond flick, which appeal to a wider audience, rather than throwing a huge budget out for niche audience. A prime example is Interstellar, which had the basic plot to potentially become \"the next 2001\", but ended up having some cheesy dialog (EUREKA!) and of course the token comic relief character (TARS).\n\ntl;dr\nMovies that are artsy, scientifically plausible, dedicated, and unique are riskier investments for studios and producers.

That is **the point**. Everything about *The Hobbit* & *LOTR* is the fact that it is small, average hobbits that do the most extraordinary thing(s). \n\n\n>Perhaps it's shallow of me, because I'm pretty sure I'm not \"missing the point\", but it ruins the epic atmosphere for me.\n\nYou've never read the book, have you?

You realize everything Aragorn did during the film was so that Frodo and Sam could destroy the ring? You were wishing away the main storyline that drove every other story line.

The thing is, even while getting what the movie/story's going for, I enjoyed Peter Jackson's \"filler crap\" more. In this particular case, the trees were more interesting than the forest. If I wanted allegory or philosophy or even some sort of fable with a moral, I'd go to media like that. \n\nThat said, unless it's also something exclusive to the movies, the \"forest\" was much more than just destroying the ring.

It is used as a metaphor. When someone says \"I ate so much. I feel big as a house now.\" We know they are not actually the size of a home. PJ added the eye in as an attempt to portray a metaphor. It has caused many to believe there was an actual eye. Usually a quick way to point out someone who has/has not read the books - not to sound elitist. \n\n\n>but it's just to show that it can still be an epic fantasy without the ring, and the hobbits.\n\nThen it isn't *The Hobbit* or *LOTR*.

I believe what you meant to say was, \"They made stuff up a long the way as filler to make 3 films\". Bolg is a minor character in *The Hobbit* narrative. Azog is mentioned once...IN THE APPENDIX! Azog died 142 years before the events in *The Hobbit* ever took place. \n\nGandalf's side-story was cool (I will give PJ that), but it was never to take place in this story either. Tolkien even added that in the book. \n>It might have been some comfort to Mr. Baggins shivering on the barrels, if he had known that news of this had reached Gandalf far away and given him great anxiety, and that he was in fact finishing his other business *(which does not come into this tale)* (*The Hobbit*, pg. 172).\n\n Tolkien did not write a book about war. He wrote a book about friendship, adventure, and food. *The Hobbit* is seen through the eyes of Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo is knocked out at the very beginning of the war. Very little else is mentioned about that war, other than the fact that the dwarves and their allies were victorious. \n\nAs far as feature-length films go, there were done well. Unfortunately for fans of *The Hobbit*, the films changed many things that make the book one of the greatest fantasy epics of all time. I appreciate PJ for attempting to bring Middle Earth to the big screen. You can honestly see he is a fan of the books; and there is no doubt tremendous interference from WB execs, but he was TOO involved to pass the buck. I know many fans want to make excuses for him; I tried myself for a long time. But facts don't care about emotion. \n\nI will add that I own all *LOTR* films and all of *The Hobbit* trilogy. And I keep watching them...but that does not excuse the blatant disregard for the source material throughout the films. I feel like this makes me insane because I keep watching them hoping something will be different. Oh well.

Visuals flip from impressive to Sci-fi Channel original movie levels of bad.

Same with the sound design which used the old Toho sound effects which simply don't work for a modern film. The pacing is also a complete joke with the film's plot deflating halfway through and limping lamely to the end in a third act full of plot holes and inconsistencies. It feels like they ran out of money, which wouldn't surprise me since Hideaki Anno tends to do that.\n\nThe characters however were the worst part. Or to put it properly lack of characters. All we get are talking heads who's names get flashed on screen once and never spoken. None of them have more than a token quirk for a personality, no development, and nothing to root them personally in the stakes of the events. No one in their right mind would call them proper characters.

I thought it was definitely a bit cartoony but accepted it for what it was, especially for the budget it had.

They're just normal people doing what they can to help their government out and fix the mess they created.

This post is speaking in general terms, not toward you.\n\n>I loved the original pieces but I also really enjoyed the old music well. I agree it was kind of jarring but I really liked the callback aspect to it.\n\nIt's honestly part of the score's biggest issue. It lacks identity. It wants to be new, but wants to wallow in nostalgia. It isn't given the chance to set a consistent tone. You flip back and forth from Sagisu's ominous and sometimes mournful original pieces to kitschy Ifukube military marches. I love Ifukube's Godzilla themes, but they do not work alongside Sagisu's original music. It's not helped by very blatant recycling of Evangelion and even Bleach soundtrack pieces, the former of which gets very blatant by the second occurrence.\n\nIt ultimately hurts the film because scenes that would *benefit* from Sagisu's style are denied it. The entire final battle feels laughable because of the almost comedicaly upbeat Ifukube score over what's supposed to be a dire situation in which could define the fate of the world. I understand they wanted the callbacks, but every moment they chose to do it is a knife in the heart of the audience's ability to take the film seriously.\n\n>There's no time for backstories or other useless information, I don't need to know about their families\n\nThat in and of itself is an objective flaw in the writing. If you don't know these people, if they don't have some kind of personal stake in the events outside their token presence, then they're not good characters or even characters at all. They're props, not people. Characters when written well are people. People with pasts, goals, families, and flaws who develop and change over the course of the story. You can't try and doll it up as, \"The film has no time for that.\" That's not how storytelling works. It's just rationalizing the poor quality of the script. If the plot is so busy that you can't include even the most scant degree of characterization or development then you've failed to write a good plot. Audiences need properly written characters to connect with the film.\n\n>Even the deaths, I LOVED that the deaths of some people we were watching were just another casualty, and there's no time to mourn as there is a more pressing issue at hand.\n\nWhen the first major \"character\" (loose use of the term) deaths occurred it was a moment of zero emotional impact. We didn't know them from a hole in the ground, and thus have no reason to care. A well done death of a named character in a film should be one that makes you care. These don't.\n\n>I think there is an emotional backbone, I think it's about the plight of the Japanese people and the emotion of the film is deeply routed in the political commentary, the mistakes the government made after fukushima, etc.\n\nThat's not an emotional backbone. That's just cheap nationalism taking the place of good writing. You have to tell a good story with a well written plot and cast, not just jerk off to nationalistic appeal. That's a flavor you add, not the point of the story. Otherwise your film is just a vehicle for blatant pandering.\n\n>Basically a lot of the stuff that'd be lost on most of the American audience.\n\nIf the film can't survive outside it's own nationalistic bubble then it's not a good film. What you've said here is a mere cop-out. It's like when people ridicule those critical of Anno's other series Evangelion, saying, \"Well you just don't *GET IT!*\"\n\nI do get it.

But if you're going to review a film, you need to use objective language and features to explain your personal reaction.\n\nI don't know that it's a 'balance' as such, rather a necessary process. 'Hate' is a perfectly legitimate response to a film. I love Mark Kermode's 'hateful' reviews of Entourage and Sex and the City 2, and that he devolves into a Marxist critique of both. But you need an explanation of some kind.\n\nHaving someone watch Citizen Kane and say 'I didn't like that' is fine. That's an opinion, but not a review (at least, not a useful one). Saying I didn't like Citizen Kane because Welles's stylistic bravado detracts from the narrative, which is itself just a Freudian cliche pitted against a Pirandello cliche - this is useful.

Likewise, as you point out, more common is a 5 star review with little useful explanation. Again, as I've mentioned before, I really loved Kermode's review of Wolf of Wall Street. Everyone at the time was just reviewing that film glowingly without much reflection, other than 'Scorsese is a genius' and 'this reminds me of Goodfellas, but updated!' Kermode didn't say it was bad, but acknowledged that 'there is something wrong here'... I remember seeing that film and thinking 'hmm... there's something about this that falls short', but I wasn't sure why.

I *love* all of them that I've seen so far (still holding out on Pete's Dragon because it just doesn't look as charming) and they've been absolutely gorgeous, not to mention being amazing films in their own right, but the more recent announcements have seemed to skew to the weird. We got Sleeping Beauty retold, then Cinderella and Jungle Book, all of which are Disney classics, now they're jumping ship to the 90's Disney Renaissance. I'm all for it as I grew up on those movies and loved them to bits, but I'm a bit miffed that Snow White is so far down the line when we're already talking about Maleficent 2/Jungle Book 2 (neither of which I think are needed) along with Lion King (hot on the heels of Jungle Book, so a bit same-y) and things like Mulan and Little Mermaid. I think if anything deserves to be fast tracked it's Snow White. That's *the* iconic Disney film that started it all, and it kind of irks me that the other \"big\" classics (Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella) got their remake already, but poor Snow is left out  in the cold. No pun intended.\n\nI won't say I'm gonna complain though, because I'll still greatly enjoy seeing what they can do with Little Mermaid and Mulan, I just kinda wish we'd see Snow White sooner than later. Meanwhile I'm also kind of sad that while we're getting the \"big\" 90's movies remade, we probably won't ever see some of the more \"cult classics\" like Tarzan, Hercules and Hunchback. Those movies were fantastic, but they've faded into enough cultural obscurity these days that they just don't seem to merit their own remakes.", "id": "dapk1y0"}, {"comment": "*Pete's Dragon* was absolutely charming and had very, very little connection to the original besides the names of the main characters and the presence of a green dragon who could cloak himself.

It's got tons of classic charm and fits right in with all the Disney live action films of the day. I don't necessarily disagree that remakes should rework the concept though. If you're going to do a remake, at least make it different enough that it's worth going to see instead of just rehashing the original exactly. I'm going to see Pete's Dragon eventually, I just haven't yet because I loved the original and wasn't dying to see this one.\n\nI agree that Lion King just doesn't need to be done. It works as an animated film, but trying to do it in a photorealistic \"live-action\" style is just going to lose something. Beauty and the Beast actually looks amazing, and I think it deserved the treatment it's getting. It's a way to introduce a new generation of kids to the classic Disney films if they aren't sold on 2D animation like so many kids today while also giving adults a reason to rewatch their favorites or go see a Disney fairytale movie without feeling like they're going to see a \"kids\" movie. They aren't so much remaking Beauty and the Beast as updating it. Belle was always a strong female character, but by today's sensibilities she still falls a little to the side of \"damsel in distress\". The new trailer showcased her actively trying to fight off the wolf pack, as well as engaging in a few more action-y sequences. They're handing the role to a young woman who is well-known for being a strong supporter of gender equality as well as an absolutely amazing actress and letting her breathe new life into a fan-favorite while making her a bit more heroic.

(Richard Linklater) => American comedy, set in the early 80's about a guy who's about to start college. Very fun.\n\n3. La La Land (Damien Chazelle) => American musical romance Very charming, with a healthy dose of melancholy.\n\n4. Ah-ga-ssi / The Handmaiden (Park Chan-wook) => Korean erotic thriller set in 30's Korea, occupied by Japan. Really can't say more, it's a twisty ride.\n\n5. Elle (Paul Verhoen) => French thriller about a high-powered woman who gets raped (in the first scene of the film)... and how she reacts to that. Not for everyone certainly, but very unexpected and featuring an all-time great performance by Isabelle Huppert.\n\n6. 10 Cloverfield Lane (Dan Trachtenberg) => American thriller about a woman who is more or less kidnapped by a man (John Goodman, great) who locks her in a bunker because he wants to protect her from some sort of apocalyptic event he says is happening.\n\n7. Forushande/The Salesman (Asghar Farhadi) => Iranian drama about a couple facing moral dilemmas... revenge, gender roles, morality in general are all at play.\n\n8. Ma vie de courgette/My Life as a Zucchini (Claude Barras) => Swiss stop-motion animated film about a child who inadvertently kills his mother (not graphic obviously, this is a children's movie) and has to go to an orphanage, and how he adapts to life there. Wonderful.\n\n9. Star Trek Beyond (Justin Lin) => American bockbuster, though it's less blockbuster-y than the previous two, more character-driven and resembling the TV shows in some ways, which makes it my favorite of the three. Very fun.\n\n10. La vache / A Man and His Cow (Mohamed Hamidi) => French feelgood comedy about an Algerian guy who gets invited to a big thing in Paris to bring his cow, which he does... traveling on foot.

Nocturama (Bertrand Bonello) => French thriller about young people (diverse backgrounds) who are preparing terror attacks in Paris (motivations unclear at least at first). Very dark because of its subject matter obviously, absolutely captivating as well.\n\n2. Everybody Wants Some!! (Richard Linklater) => American comedy, set in the early 80's about a guy who's about to start college. Very fun.\n\n3. La La Land (Damien Chazelle) => American musical romance Very charming, with a healthy dose of melancholy.\n\n4. Ah-ga-ssi / The Handmaiden (Park Chan-wook) => Korean erotic thriller set in 30's Korea, occupied by Japan. Really can't say more, it's a twisty ride.\n\n5. Elle (Paul Verhoen) => French thriller about a high-powered woman who gets raped (in the first scene of the film)... and how she reacts to that. Not for everyone certainly, but very unexpected and featuring an all-time great performance by Isabelle Huppert.\n\n6. 10 Cloverfield Lane (Dan Trachtenberg) => American thriller about a woman who is more or less kidnapped by a man (John Goodman, great) who locks her in a bunker because he wants to protect her from some sort of apocalyptic event he says is happening.\n\n7. Forushande/The Salesman (Asghar Farhadi) => Iranian drama about a couple facing moral dilemmas... revenge, gender roles, morality in general are all at play.\n\n8. Ma vie de courgette/My Life as a Zucchini (Claude Barras) => Swiss stop-motion animated film about a child who inadvertently kills his mother (not graphic obviously, this is a children's movie) and has to go to an orphanage, and how he adapts to life there. Wonderful.\n\n9. Star Trek Beyond (Justin Lin) => American bockbuster, though it's less blockbuster-y than the previous two, more character-driven and resembling the TV shows in some ways, which makes it my favorite of the three. Very fun.\n\n10. La vache / A Man and His Cow (Mohamed Hamidi) => French feelgood comedy about an Algerian guy who gets invited to a big thing in Paris to bring his cow, which he does... traveling on foot.

That was because people thought Batman Returns was too dark. Remember Batman Begins? That's because people thought Batman & Robin was too light.\n\nMoS and BvS themselves are a response to the success of the Nolan films (thus they wanted to replicate the tone), and the comparable criticism of Superman Returns (thus they wanted to avoid a light tone) and the outright hatred of Green Lantern (their original attempt to start a DC Extended Universe by aping the lighter tone of the Marvel Films released thus far by 2011).\n\nWB will do the same kneejerk response to BvS now, which is why Suicide Squad was heavily edited and reshot to alter the tone in post, and why Justice League will probably be pretty light. I assume the same of Aquaman unless the public has some kneejerk hate reaction to a light DC film in the interim (say, the Flash).\n\nIf you think they will stick to an artistic vision instead of trying to expand the user base of what they clearly consider to be pretty much just a product, I think you'll be disappointed. The best thing I feel fans of DC can do is just be flexible--they will never attempt to appeal to people who actually like the current DCEU movies, seeing them multiple times and buying the blu-rays; they will always be chasing after the people who saw them once and then did not stop complaining about them for literally years afterwards.\n\nIf Justice League makes a billion dollars they will stick with that tone until that tone underperforms, at which point it's off to chasing the zeitgeist once again, instead of creating the zeitgeist themselves.", "id": "daq7i9z"}, {"comment": "This is my problem with DCEU.

Marvel hasn't been without their stumbles and trip-ups but they're staying the course. WB/DC are so unsure of themselves it's clear they didn't have a real end goal that was made from passion but instead greed.\n\nSeriously, I recommend the DC animated movies over the past 3 we got.

They always do that (the reaction to Batman Returns made them make the Schumacher movies, the reaction to Batman & Robin led to Batman Begins, MoS was a reaction to both the success of the Nolan films and the comparable luke-warm reception of Superman Returns, and now the reaction to BvS is leading to the supposed lightness of Justice League and I assume this movie, whether they call for it or not.

Buuutt because this is a fantasy senario, I'm factoring out the fact that this movie would likely have a hard time standing up to flagship titles that already have brand recognition. It might make its money back in DVD sales or something and I'll likely be pushed down to low budget films from then on. Haha. Also, if I have a damn VFX budget, I'm going to use it on Scott Pilgrim style special effects for these fights which will hold an heightened quality to them, despite being live action. Think like, a kung fu movie with comic book style vfx and an almost urban style ascetic to it. \n\nI'd probably pitch something along the lines of a movie where central protagonist accidentally stood up to, and beat the greatest fighter on the planet, making him the top fighter on the planet for this 48 hour fighting contest that's going on. Because of this, a ton of unique fighters (some with supernatural powers, some guys in robot suits, etc) show up in an attempt to knock him down and take his position. The movie would consist of him attempting to ask this girl out that he is in love with and then being attacked over and over and pulled into these epic fights while he is attempting to get this 'perfect' girl to fall in love with him. He later finds out that she is also a fighter and they join together to take out the puppet master guy who is organizing the contest.

Buuutt because this is a fantasy senario, I'm factoring out the fact that this movie would likely have a hard time standing up to flagship titles that already have brand recognition. It might make its money back in DVD sales or something and I'll likely be pushed down to low budget films from then on. Haha. Also, if I have a damn VFX budget, I'm going to use it on Scott Pilgrim style special effects for these fights which will hold an heightened quality to them, despite being live action. Think like, a kung fu movie with comic book style vfx and an almost urban style ascetic to it. \n\nI'd probably pitch something along the lines of a movie where central protagonist accidentally stood up to, and beat the greatest fighter on the planet, making him the top fighter on the planet for this 48 hour fighting contest that's going on. Because of this, a ton of unique fighters (some with supernatural powers, some guys in robot suits, etc) show up in an attempt to knock him down and take his position. The movie would consist of him attempting to ask this girl out that he is in love with and then being attacked over and over and pulled into these epic fights while he is attempting to get this 'perfect' girl to fall in love with him. He later finds out that she is also a fighter and they join together to take out the puppet master guy who is organizing the contest. I don't have any sort of polish for the idea yet, but I think that's what I'd go with, especially if I wasn't allowed to take a hold of a franchise like DC or Marvel.\n\nOtherwise I'd probably do the Shazam movies, cast John Cena as Shazam and then spend a good chunk of the movie with Billy and his Uncle driving across the country trying to hide from the antagonists, but also helping people, while Black Adam is attempting to hunt him down and steal his powers to kind of regain his strength again.  *shrugs* ", "id": "daqdags"}, {"comment": "You described the plot of Scott pilgrim vs the world ", "id": "daqdnyh"}, {"comment": "I described the plot of a lot of movies.", "id": "daqdosi"}, {"comment": "First thing I thought of too", "id": "daqj4db"}], [{"comment": "Altered Carbon trilogy by Richard Morgan.

Prepare for some meshing of different styles, brain twister flicks, and actors talking directly to the camera, etc.\n\n- Italian neorealists, who, for my money, should be simply called realists, as it was the first cinematic movement to switch from theatrical scenarios to much more realistic ones, about the working class, the grim realities of post-war europe, and total moral greyness. Beautiful, often heartbreaking films from De Sica, Rossellini, Pasolini, etc.\n\n- Love the later italian directors as well. Nobody does grandiose quite as well as them, whether its an iconic Sergio Leone spaghetti western, or a historical drama by Visconti where every frame would make a great painting. Antonioni had better eye for photograph than maybe any other director ever, Fellini is his own world, but Bertolucci and Tornatore are also amazing.\n\n- That crazy nutjob surrealist Luis Bunuel. While Dali is the most famous surrealist artist of all time, I think Bunuel outgrew him, when he realized that instead of surrealism for the sake of surrealism, he can use the style to say more profound things. Some people will say his early, purely surrealist movies are the best, but if you ask me its the exact opposite.\n\n- I love the contemporary neorealists. I believe at its best it is the highest form of cinema, and foreign directors always seem to have a step advantage compared to the US ones (not to underestimate them either in this regard). The depth of acting, writing and directing you need to pull off a ~120 min movie that is so realistic that might just as well happen in real life exactly the same (this gives it extra emotional power) and yet so compactly put together that seemingly no time is wasted (making them not boring) is incredible. Movies like Separation, The Kid With a Bike, Winter Sleep, Blue Is The Warmest Colour are some examples that represent this style.

Hopefully Son of Saul wont just be a blip in the darkness, but rather the start of something bigger.\n\n- I consider gangster movies to be one of the best american genres. But in the last two decades or so, seemingly all the best gangster movies came out of international cinema. City of God, A Prophet, Pusher trilogy are some of them.\n\n- Miscellanous directors/styles, including but not limited to:\n\n- Werner Herzog, one of my favourite people ever. You cannot even imagine to what lengths this guy went just to understand, and document human nature at its most naked form. Fascinating character all around.\n\n- Refn is style personified. You wont see a more viking feeling movie than Valhalla Rising, you wont see a more neon-lit urban noir feeling movie than Only God Forgives, etc. Dont try to understand every bit of his movies, as they are not as much narrative based. \n\n- Lanthimos crazy ideas, blacker than pitch black deadpan comedies with harsh social criticisms.\n\n- Goddamn I almost forgot about the legend, Tarkovsky. Well....Tarkovsky!\n\n- The magical realism and pure joy of Kusturica.\n\n- Tons of maybe not so deep but still very cool and original thriller makers from Ozon to Park Chan-Wook.

And F\u00e1bry Zolt\u00e1n might be Hungarys best kept secret, if you want a deep morality play, you can't go wrong with The Fifth Seal. Hopefully Son of Saul wont just be a blip in the darkness, but rather the start of something bigger.\n\n- I consider gangster movies to be one of the best american genres. But in the last two decades or so, seemingly all the best gangster movies came out of international cinema. City of God, A Prophet, Pusher trilogy are some of them.\n\n- Miscellanous directors/styles, including but not limited to:\n\n- Werner Herzog, one of my favourite people ever. You cannot even imagine to what lengths this guy went just to understand, and document human nature at its most naked form. Fascinating character all around.\n\n- Refn is style personified. You wont see a more viking feeling movie than Valhalla Rising, you wont see a more neon-lit urban noir feeling movie than Only God Forgives, etc. Dont try to understand every bit of his movies, as they are not as much narrative based. \n\n- Lanthimos crazy ideas, blacker than pitch black deadpan comedies with harsh social criticisms.\n\n- Goddamn I almost forgot about the legend, Tarkovsky. Well....Tarkovsky!\n\n- The magical realism and pure joy of Kusturica.\n\n- Tons of maybe not so deep but still very cool and original thriller makers from Ozon to Park Chan-Wook. Korean cinema apparently has a lot of these guys, but Im uneducated in the genre, yet.\n\nThis will be enough for now.", "id": "dapza05"}], [{"comment": "I'd say Lars von Trier, you either love him or hate him but you have to admit he's brilliant.

I know they were undercover, so they couldn't exactly start high-fiving each other, but I think Nolan left these reaction shots deliberately ambiguous. Perhaps they were really a squad of dream spies, or maybe they were just convenient images for his subconscious to use in a dream state.\n\nAnd there's just a lot of other dreamlike stuff. The editing from the very start cuts the scenes in such away that time and location jump the way they often do in dreams. Then there's the impossible machine that connects all the dreamers into one dream. It's never explained how it works or where it came from. It's just there and it works, just like it would in a dream. And then there's the scene where he gets the plane tickets and the guy says, \"It's now or never, Cobb.\" The audience infills from the context that this is because Cobb is a fugitive. But who is that guy? Why does Cobb have to leave? It's never explained, but it could just be a memory that reverberatea in his dream of when he found out he had to leave to take advantage of a business opportunity when he really wanted to just spend more time with his kids.\n\nThis also leaves open the possibility that the Cillian Murphy character is actually a projection of Cobb (a businessman), who is still wrestling with issues in his relationship with his father. Perhaps mistakes he doesn't want to make with his own children, which is why he was reluctant to leave (\"now or never\") and why he is so eager to get back home.\n\nWhen you look at the film like this, Mal's efforts to kill Cobb or get him stuck in limbo with her are just dream manifestations of his subconscious yearning to reunite with his wife in death or attempts at wish fulfillment to stay dreaming forever since it's now only in dreams that he gets to see her again. Now, I could be remembering this wrong, but I seem to recall that there is a recurring statement that Cobb \"needs to get home.\" This is sort of like his subconscious admission that he will have to wake up eventually. But it's also just a common feeling to have when one has been away and is ready to return to their loved ones.\n\nIt also helps explain why the children are the same age at the end: in reality, Cobb was just away on business for a short time, not a fugitive living in exile for years.\n\nAnyway, probably not a perfect theory. But I think this movie is meant to be watched through different lenses of interpretation to find different meanings. And this is a lens that I've never come across, so I thought I'd share. It's less exciting than other ones, but I think it's a lot more personal.

In my theory, the conversation with Saito at the bottom of the layers was meant to plant the seed of doubt. Imagine the conversation with Saito saying the things Cobb was supposed to realize, leading Cobb to take on Mallorie's role:\n\nSaito: Have you come to kill me? I've been waiting for someone...\n\nCobb: Someone from a half remembered dream.\n\nSaito: Cobb? Impossible. We were young men together.

So him falling would have kicked him out of Saito's dream.

I know they were undercover, so they couldn't exactly start high-fiving each other, but I think Nolan left these reaction shots deliberately ambiguous. Perhaps they were really a squad of dream spies, or maybe they were just convenient images for his subconscious to use in a dream state.\n\nAnd there's just a lot of other dreamlike stuff. The editing from the very start cuts the scenes in such away that time and location jump the way they often do in dreams. Then there's the impossible machine that connects all the dreamers into one dream. It's never explained how it works or where it came from. It's just there and it works, just like it would in a dream. And then there's the scene where he gets the plane tickets and the guy says, \"It's now or never, Cobb.\" The audience infills from the context that this is because Cobb is a fugitive. But who is that guy? Why does Cobb have to leave? It's never explained, but it could just be a memory that reverberatea in his dream of when he found out he had to leave to take advantage of a business opportunity when he really wanted to just spend more time with his kids.\n\nThis also leaves open the possibility that the Cillian Murphy character is actually a projection of Cobb (a businessman), who is still wrestling with issues in his relationship with his father. Perhaps mistakes he doesn't want to make with his own children, which is why he was reluctant to leave (\"now or never\") and why he is so eager to get back home.\n\nWhen you look at the film like this, Mal's efforts to kill Cobb or get him stuck in limbo with her are just dream manifestations of his subconscious yearning to reunite with his wife in death or attempts at wish fulfillment to stay dreaming forever since it's now only in dreams that he gets to see her again. Now, I could be remembering this wrong, but I seem to recall that there is a recurring statement that Cobb \"needs to get home.\" This is sort of like his subconscious admission that he will have to wake up eventually. But it's also just a common feeling to have when one has been away and is ready to return to their loved ones.\n\nIt also helps explain why the children are the same age at the end: in reality, Cobb was just away on business for a short time, not a fugitive living in exile for years.\n\nAnyway, probably not a perfect theory. But I think this movie is meant to be watched through different lenses of interpretation to find different meanings. And this is a lens that I've never come across, so I thought I'd share. It's less exciting than other ones, but I think it's a lot more personal. It changes the focus of the movie from philosophical questions about the nature of reality to emotional ones about how to cope with loss and what is really important in life.", "id": "dar45ia"}, {"comment": "Beautiful explanation.

In my theory, the conversation with Saito at the bottom of the layers was meant to plant the seed of doubt. Imagine the conversation with Saito saying the things Cobb was supposed to realize, leading Cobb to take on Mallorie's role:\n\nSaito: Have you come to kill me?

The whole movie was a window to the world of Ancient Egyptian Mythology; \n\nIt did its job, but not as well as I expected. \n\nI expected the transformed character of gods to be more natural/fluid but not blocky/robot-esq (like this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO5tgluwW5w), I expected robust acting from the lead (Horus) but I got mediocre tall guy being all emo and shit; I was expecting a greater friction between Bek and Horus, all I got is like one of those escort missions in videogames. \n\nI think that the lead actor was mis-casted. I wanted to see an egyptian prince/god, not tarzan.\nIf the director was more creative in using the transformations metaphorically, It would have been awesome. It was already established in the beginning of the movie that gods have gold in them instead of blood, but making the gods metal-esq was really silly. The director did use this for Ra and Isis, but for some reason decided to use robot-esq features for Horus and Set.\n\nAlso, the whole upgrading scene of Set is fucking joke.  They're fucking gods, why the fuck do they need welding???? \n\ncould've been sufficient to show some kind of absorption of powers to convey instead of the abomination.\n\nimages credit: https://123wtf.me/2016/06/05/wtf-gods-of-egypt-2016/", "id": "daqurp9"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "daq155e"}, {"comment": "more like : http://i.imgur.com/twMrSQo.jpg", "id": "daq1duf"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "daq1mj4"}, {"comment": "idk :s", "id": "daq1mzh"}, {"comment": "Fuck yes Gods of Egypt was brilliant.

It was my first job out of college and he offered me so much guidance and has treated me like family from day one. As far as the making of it went, since I hadn\u2019t done another movie and didn\u2019t have any context, the specifics of the shoot were kind of lost on me at the time; I was just relishing every moment like it was summer camp. Like, a super rad acting summer camp where I got to work intimately with an Oscar nominee. It was an absolute blast and I made lifelong friends like Rob Mayes and Fabianne Therese who I am still super close to. Brad Baruh, the producer, is a top ten homie. Not to mention Clancy Brown who may be my number one draft pick in terms of humans. It was incredible. But only in reflecting on the shoot in the years since did I really get a sense of what a feat Don was able to pull off and how special his approach is. He\u2019s a guy who pulls of the impossible budget and scope-wise but I never felt like he wasn\u2019t at ease. Not to mention the fact that his mind is absolutely singular and incredible. I mean, the guy made PHANTASM when he was twenty one. Weirdly, I was twenty one when I shot JOHN DIES, so maybe that connected us further. At the end of the day, I could not ask for a better friend or mentor. I\u2019ve never felt anything other than 100% support from him and it\u2019s meant so much. He\u2019s just a remarkable guy with a great family that happens to be this unapologetically balls-out weird as shit trailblazing filmmaker and he totally changed my life.

Similarly I think Scorsese totally knows how to move the camera, how to move characters around in a space, how to frame a story visually. Also he has a fabulous relationship with his editor, Thelma Schoonmaker who has an excellent eye for the bigger picture and knowing that pace is more important than small mistakes.\n\nI also think Scorsese has a natural fascination with humanity.

Scorsese is a master of drawing you into the story and helping you escape into it."], [2, "It will be interesting to compare *American Gangster* with Scorsese's next project, in order to figure out how some directors can actually improve scripts. If Scorsese had shot American Gangster, I think he would have gotten further away from the protagonist and explored some of the surrounding characters. The ability to lose the plot, to forget the protagonist and find your way back to him, is a major trope in this style of storytelling. Compare Mark Twain's *The Prince And The Pauper* to *The Departed*. Where Twain would constantly remind us of the character's birth, of the individuality, Scorsese is confident enough to say, *just forget about which one you're looking at, and interpret this holistically!*, and he gets away with it because they inhabit such a close milieu. This directorial technique would begin with a flurry of violence, but once the story unrolls and you're forced to pull back in order to take it all in, you know that he'll agitate you again with a new outbreak of violence. The violence is not the draw here, it's actually used sparingly as a form of punctuation, or a reminder to pay attention. It's a thrill that isn't easily approximated by television news, because there's so little story, and such a deficit of rambling, on the average news broadcast.\n\nThe Catholic consciousness is so *visually literate*, it can be less linear and far more like the mind of a switchboard operator or ballroom dancer. A stock of visual ideas can very quickly spread like wildfire, almost like an explosion of sign language among the deaf. At times it seems like you're getting something random, frivolous or verging on being a non sequitur, and then you realize that it actually makes perfect sense and that it arose in the midst of a very high tradition. It's easy to love and respect that when you find it communicating so openly. \n\nOne thing that seems notable, is the idea that Vallon in *Gangs of New York* is **a Valois-Irish character**, while Sheeran in *The Irishman* is in some respect, **a Norman-Irish character**.

Similarly I think Scorsese totally knows how to move the camera, how to move characters around in a space, how to frame a story visually. Also he has a fabulous relationship with his editor, Thelma Schoonmaker who has an excellent eye for the bigger picture and knowing that pace is more important than small mistakes.\n\nI also think Scorsese has a natural fascination with humanity.

If Scorsese had shot American Gangster, I think he would have gotten further away from the protagonist and explored some of the surrounding characters. The ability to lose the plot, to forget the protagonist and find your way back to him, is a major trope in this style of storytelling. Compare Mark Twain's *The Prince And The Pauper* to *The Departed*. Where Twain would constantly remind us of the character's birth, of the individuality, Scorsese is confident enough to say, *just forget about which one you're looking at, and interpret this holistically!*, and he gets away with it because they inhabit such a close milieu. This directorial technique would begin with a flurry of violence, but once the story unrolls and you're forced to pull back in order to take it all in, you know that he'll agitate you again with a new outbreak of violence. The violence is not the draw here, it's actually used sparingly as a form of punctuation, or a reminder to pay attention. It's a thrill that isn't easily approximated by television news, because there's so little story, and such a deficit of rambling, on the average news broadcast.\n\nThe Catholic consciousness is so *visually literate*, it can be less linear and far more like the mind of a switchboard operator or ballroom dancer. A stock of visual ideas can very quickly spread like wildfire, almost like an explosion of sign language among the deaf. At times it seems like you're getting something random, frivolous or verging on being a non sequitur, and then you realize that it actually makes perfect sense and that it arose in the midst of a very high tradition. It's easy to love and respect that when you find it communicating so openly. \n\nOne thing that seems notable, is the idea that Vallon in *Gangs of New York* is **a Valois-Irish character**, while Sheeran in *The Irishman* is in some respect, **a Norman-Irish character**. Is it intentional? Possibly not, because there is nothing overt about this orientation, but it would be funny if American screenwriters had reached a point where they felt as though they had to reach back into history for a European analogue, in order to discuss what's happening in American life right now.\n\n**Result of the Hundred Years War**: http://i.imgur.com/I2JezSP.jpg\n\n**The Valois-Burgundian territory**, which remained successful in international trade , particularly with Asia: http://i.imgur.com/sETwSkQ.jpg", "id": "daqdrju"}], [{"comment": "He's skilled at choosing scripts that suit the kind of tone he's great at evoking.\n\nThe other directors you mentioned write all of their own stuff.", "id": "daqduzp"}], [{"comment": "For me, it's how every movie feels so personal, somehow, despite the subject; my favorite thing about Mean Streets is that the opening line about paying for your sins in church being bullsh!t, and having to deal with it in the streets, was read by Scorsese instead of Harvey Keitel\n\nThat's extremely ballsy, and speaks volumes I think, for someone who's only other movie up to that point was an exploitation sequel\n\nRoger Ebert's reviews of his movies are extremely enlightening on the subject; if you ever get a chance, read through all of them, his insight to Scorsese's movies and how his personal history and internal struggles shaped his early movies especially, makes you realize how raw the emotions are in them, from the actors performances to how his music choices all reflect and add to the scenes rather than just being something that sounds good behind them (Coincidentally when I came across this thread, I was listening to the Shutter Island soundtrack) ", "id": "daqfwqj"}], [{"comment": "His command of the medium ", "id": "daqheq6"}], [{"comment": "Martin Scorsese.", "id": "daqnr0t"}], [{"comment": "His movies have a sense of electricity and life.

It's a very sudden change of pace. The film reaches a climax, and it even features a direct homage to the ending of Misery. When Mike is eating and he sees a waitress. The film feels like it's wrapping up. And because horror films are often so short, it doesn't feel that out of place.

Past this point, they felt the film just went \"on and on\", and they didn't find any value from what is essentially a 45 minute long \"gotcha\" sequence.\n\nBut I think the second act is what elevates the film from being just another \"lone actor faces their demons\" story into something far more menacing. \"The banality of evil,\" are Mike puts it early in the film. The curious thing about 1408 is that it's a film that very rarely resorts to classic jump scares involving overtly disturbing visuals. It's most effective jump scare is a radio turning on.\n\nAnd this is one reason it divides people. It doesn't speak the universal language of gore and twisted demonic faces that other horror films rely on. (Think Jacob's Ladder, for example.) It instead speaks a language of personal torment where the banal and the benign are slightly twisted into something collectively evil.
