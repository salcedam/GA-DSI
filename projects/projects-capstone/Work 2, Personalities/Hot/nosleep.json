The \"hand\" hidden in the fish hidden in the smuggler's hold suggests something like cocaine or heroin (sealed inside a rubber glove, not a real hand), but one glove full of cocaine or heroin, while certainly worth a few bucks, wouldn't be worth smuggling on its own.  Not sure why they sucked on the finger - Perhaps in some sort of imitation of how in every cop show, people test cocaine by rubbing it on their gums?  That would suggest the guys were basically just hired thugs who didn't really know what they were doing.\n\nAnyway, the guys, possibly not knowing the nature of the cargo, would have tried to deliver what they had found to *their* customer, who wouldn't have felt even remotely happy about receiving the hand/glove (whatever it was) and not so nicely demanded the real cargo.  After tearing the boat down to splinters and not finding anything else, the guys went back to the house to collect anything else that might have come from their \"friend\" in the hope that they could recover the real cargo.  Since they left, rather than waiting around for the family to come home to torture into telling anything they knew, they must have found what they wanted.\n \nFrom the list of gifts, my best guess as to the *real* nature of the cargo would be either the silver brush set itself (as some sort of mindbogglingly valuable ancient artifact); or some form of data (classified, corporate espionage, blackmail material, something like that) on a flash drive, that could have been hidden in just about any of those gifts.", "id": "dao9bcq"}, {"comment": "As somebody that hasn't read all of the stories yet (I am just finding these through the links of other stories), I think you should probably consider putting a spoiler alert on comments such as this.

Foster sibling never had to do chores.\n\nThe foster dad used to be in the military so when my brother and I used to get in trouble which seemed to happen a lot we'd get the belt or a wooden cane across the bottom which was unpleasant to say the least. After that the other punishment was sitting on our beds until it was time for dinner, no books, no toys, no games, nothing. \n\nThe foster mum had a real dislike for me, I absolutely deplored veggies as a kid but there was no leaving the table till all of the food on my plate was finished though that wasn't the case for their children.

One night I was siting at the table crying because I really hated peas and couldn't eat them. My foster mother sat there yelling at me until I did, I took two forkfuls, chewed and swallowed before I threw them back up on to my plate.... she then made me eat that too.\n\nEventually she gave up fighting with me about it and would sit me on the back patio until I ate my veggies, I quickly came up with the idea to bury them in the garden and pretend I'd eaten them. I got away with it for the rest of the year we were with this family.\n\nMy brother didn't have too much trouble getting along with them but I really missed my mum and I was angry that we had to go live with these strange people so I acted out a lot. \n\nUnfortunately I ended up in the custody of my Aunt after that year which believe it or not was the worse of two evils. 12 years later and I moved out, 5 years out of home and one restraining order later I'm now seeing people to try and regain some semblance of sanity.\n"], [3, "They deserved it.

They were definitely treated better than my brother and I. Foster sister was into horse riding and we got dragged out of the house to watch her jumping tournaments and stuff in the sweltering heat (I live in West Australia for clarification.) and this was in rural west Aus. \n\nOf course everyone was supposed to chip in with the chores because we lived on a farm (i.e. collecting the eggs, milking the cow etc) but the foster mum would make my brother and I get up at 5:30 in the morning to help her deliver papers for the neighbours which were miles apart. Foster sibling never had to do chores.\n\nThe foster dad used to be in the military so when my brother and I used to get in trouble which seemed to happen a lot we'd get the belt or a wooden cane across the bottom which was unpleasant to say the least. After that the other punishment was sitting on our beds until it was time for dinner, no books, no toys, no games, nothing. \n\nThe foster mum had a real dislike for me, I absolutely deplored veggies as a kid but there was no leaving the table till all of the food on my plate was finished though that wasn't the case for their children. The first week I was with them we had steamed vegetables one night and I told her I didn't like them. She made me sit there until 3 in the morning until she decided to give up for the night. I still had to get up for school that morning and I wasn't allowed breakfast, I had to eat the vegetables I didn't eat the night before. I didn't eat for two days before she finally threw the veggies out. \n\nI struggled a lot with that, I really hate peas but this one incident cemented it. One night I was siting at the table crying because I really hated peas and couldn't eat them. My foster mother sat there yelling at me until I did, I took two forkfuls, chewed and swallowed before I threw them back up on to my plate.... she then made me eat that too.\n\nEventually she gave up fighting with me about it and would sit me on the back patio until I ate my veggies, I quickly came up with the idea to bury them in the garden and pretend I'd eaten them. I got away with it for the rest of the year we were with this family.\n\nMy brother didn't have too much trouble getting along with them but I really missed my mum and I was angry that we had to go live with these strange people so I acted out a lot. \n\nUnfortunately I ended up in the custody of my Aunt after that year which believe it or not was the worse of two evils. 12 years later and I moved out, 5 years out of home and one restraining order later I'm now seeing people to try and regain some semblance of sanity.\n", "id": "danunjk"}], [{"comment": "They deserved it.

An intranquil spirit could have been a muderer, a criminal in real life or someone who committed suicide and they are in a limbo state until someone who works with the dead summons the spirit to work for them until that person gets what they want. Did the husband's wife who was murdered or her lover know people in the occult or who practice espiritism?

You need to contact a Hoodoo specialist or something. Contact someone that is experienced with demons or spirits and maybe they'll know what's up. But as of right now it seems like someone must have hated John and must've been a Hoodoo practicer or something. They put dust on John's property which made the demon spirit follow him. Then one morning or afternoon he was minding his business while a random thing comes out of the attic kills his sister and wife and he doesn't realize anything. He is also around the scene which makes him get the blood and plays the victim. Like you said, John looks really weak so how could he have broken someone down into bones. And how did they have black dust in their lungs. Honestly it's probably someone who did summon this demon and is planning to do this to multiple people. Once they finish off John and declare if he's guilty or not then he'll move on. And dude be careful out there.. John had a dream and so did you.. If anything the demon spirit might have chained onto you. Wish for the best of you.

I tried googling what hoodoo was about, but I was only getting vague references to \"magic\" and I wasn't really satisfied.. scientifically, if you will, by whatever the Internet was trying to explain to me about hoodoo and how it \"works.\"\n\nNevertheless, these posts were meticulous and patiently written.

Thanks again for the updates, and best wishes to you.\n\n(Also, a question - is it possible that OP won't be \"haunted,\" even after moving residences, if he simply stopped truly believing in the effects of hoodoo? I mean, he, himself, is aware that it only affects people who believe in it... So can't he just, not?

Maybe the guy in the closet was Timmys creepy dad or maybe twin? Which would explain how your dad and uncle supposedly saw him at the same time.
