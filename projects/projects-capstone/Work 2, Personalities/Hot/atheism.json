"], [1, "Let me tell you something similar from my own experience.\n\nProbably the most intense emotion I ever experienced was also in a counseling session with my first wife. We ended up splitting, which, as it turns out, was a good thing, but for a long time I refused to believe our breakup was inevitable. I'm a tenacious kind of guy, and I tend to believe any problem can be solved, and I was willing to follow the counselor's lead and put myself through whatever pain was necessary.\n\nWe had been talking about our families of origin. I had just finished describing a particularly painful experience from my childhood that mirrored the feelings I was having about the failure of our marriage. Then the counselor made a comment that sort of summarized everything. That triggered an opening of the floodgates for me and I started sobbing. I mean, literally, sobbing. I was about 30 years old, and I hadn't done that since I was a toddler. (And I didn't do it again until a few years later when my father died, but I digress.) I no longer cared about preserving my dignity or anything really. I just let it go.\n\nAs I gradually calmed down, strange thoughts and sensations popped into my head. My eyes felt funny. My whole head felt funny. I looked around the room as if I was seeing it for the first time, trying to get an impression of how the world had changed for me, because everything felt different. I suddenly became aware of traffic noises outside the window. We were on the second floor of a building located on a busy intersection. Those noises had always been there, but for some reason I had never noticed them or paid attention to them. Now they seemed significant. I thought about how many people there were in the world, and how they were all going about their business, as if nothing at all was going on in this little psychologist's counseling room on the second floor. I felt as if my problems were pretty insignificant in this huge network of activity that was going on outside this window, in this city, in this state, in the world. Yet I felt like part of that activity.\n\nAnd my clothes felt strange. In those days I used to wear a 3-piece suit to work, and I was wearing it then, because I was expecting to go straight to work after our appointment. I was used to wearing a suit, but right then I didn't feel used to it. It felt burdensome and useless. For a moment I wished I could be naked. The thought crossed my mind: I wonder how my wife and the counselor would react if I got naked right now? Obviously, they wouldn't understand; therefore, it would be unwise to do it. But I felt as if I *could* do it, without the slightest embarrassment.\n\nIt must have taken only a few seconds for these thoughts to race through my head. Then the counselor asked: \"What are you feeling right now?\" (They always say that.)\n\nI paused, and then said: \"I feel as if I don't belong here\u2014in these clothes.\"\n\nMy wife and the counselor immediately burst out laughing. I didn't take offense, because I understood perfectly why this statement would make no sense to them. They had no idea what I had been thinking, and I knew it would be pointless to explain it to them. I really didn't care what anybody thought.\n\nWe wound up that day's counseling session pretty quickly after that. Instead of going straight to work, as I had planned, I went somewhere and got a cup of coffee, because I felt I needed\u2014and deserved\u2014some time to ponder what had just happened.\n\nIf I had been of a religious frame of mind at that time, I probably could have figured out some religious interpretation of what happened to me. I could have said: the Holy Spirit came over me, or something. That would have been easier if the counselor had used any religious imagery to guide me, but she hadn't. This counselor's approach was totally secular, which was fine with me, because I had been an atheist for around 10 years. (Before that, I had been a serious Christian.)\n\nInstead of thinking about people driving by in their cars, I could have thought about angels flying around heaven. Instead of wishing I could take off my heavy corduroy suit and go naked, I could have imagined myself wearing my heavenly robe. (Those things do look pretty comfortable if you go commando, I suppose.) By saying \"I don't belong here\" I could have implied I was longing for heaven. But I didn't do any of that.\n\nBut that's what strong emotion does to you. It makes thoughts and sensations appear that are hard to explain.

", "id": "dao50zi"}], [{"comment": "Let me tell you something similar from my own experience.\n\nProbably the most intense emotion I ever experienced was also in a counseling session with my first wife. We ended up splitting, which, as it turns out, was a good thing, but for a long time I refused to believe our breakup was inevitable. I'm a tenacious kind of guy, and I tend to believe any problem can be solved, and I was willing to follow the counselor's lead and put myself through whatever pain was necessary.\n\nWe had been talking about our families of origin. I had just finished describing a particularly painful experience from my childhood that mirrored the feelings I was having about the failure of our marriage. Then the counselor made a comment that sort of summarized everything. That triggered an opening of the floodgates for me and I started sobbing. I mean, literally, sobbing. I was about 30 years old, and I hadn't done that since I was a toddler. (And I didn't do it again until a few years later when my father died, but I digress.) I no longer cared about preserving my dignity or anything really. I just let it go.\n\nAs I gradually calmed down, strange thoughts and sensations popped into my head. My eyes felt funny. My whole head felt funny. I looked around the room as if I was seeing it for the first time, trying to get an impression of how the world had changed for me, because everything felt different. I suddenly became aware of traffic noises outside the window. We were on the second floor of a building located on a busy intersection. Those noises had always been there, but for some reason I had never noticed them or paid attention to them. Now they seemed significant. I thought about how many people there were in the world, and how they were all going about their business, as if nothing at all was going on in this little psychologist's counseling room on the second floor. I felt as if my problems were pretty insignificant in this huge network of activity that was going on outside this window, in this city, in this state, in the world. Yet I felt like part of that activity.\n\nAnd my clothes felt strange. In those days I used to wear a 3-piece suit to work, and I was wearing it then, because I was expecting to go straight to work after our appointment. I was used to wearing a suit, but right then I didn't feel used to it. It felt burdensome and useless. For a moment I wished I could be naked. The thought crossed my mind: I wonder how my wife and the counselor would react if I got naked right now? Obviously, they wouldn't understand; therefore, it would be unwise to do it. But I felt as if I *could* do it, without the slightest embarrassment.\n\nIt must have taken only a few seconds for these thoughts to race through my head. Then the counselor asked: \"What are you feeling right now?\" (They always say that.)\n\nI paused, and then said: \"I feel as if I don't belong here\u2014in these clothes.\"\n\nMy wife and the counselor immediately burst out laughing. I didn't take offense, because I understood perfectly why this statement would make no sense to them. They had no idea what I had been thinking, and I knew it would be pointless to explain it to them. I really didn't care what anybody thought.\n\nWe wound up that day's counseling session pretty quickly after that. Instead of going straight to work, as I had planned, I went somewhere and got a cup of coffee, because I felt I needed\u2014and deserved\u2014some time to ponder what had just happened.\n\nIf I had been of a religious frame of mind at that time, I probably could have figured out some religious interpretation of what happened to me. I could have said: the Holy Spirit came over me, or something. That would have been easier if the counselor had used any religious imagery to guide me, but she hadn't. This counselor's approach was totally secular, which was fine with me, because I had been an atheist for around 10 years. (Before that, I had been a serious Christian.)\n\nInstead of thinking about people driving by in their cars, I could have thought about angels flying around heaven. Instead of wishing I could take off my heavy corduroy suit and go naked, I could have imagined myself wearing my heavenly robe. (Those things do look pretty comfortable if you go commando, I suppose.) By saying \"I don't belong here\" I could have implied I was longing for heaven. But I didn't do any of that.\n\nBut that's what strong emotion does to you. It makes thoughts and sensations appear that are hard to explain.

Even the issues raised about her visa have nothing to do with vetting with regards to radicalism or terrorism but [technical issues regarding her entering the US on the basis of whether she had met or not met her to-be husband](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/12/19/tashfeen-maliks-visa-sloppily-approved-according-to-congressman-who-reviewed-immigration-application/).\n\nThe Tsarnaev brothers came to the US in 2004, when the elder was 17-18 and the younger was 10-11. By all accounts, they were not radicalized at this time. The elder used to drink alcohol and boxed - both of which are not allowed in Islam. He became radicalized after 2007-08.\n\nSo, neither of these cases you bring up are the fault of improper vetting. Tashfeen may or may not have been radicalized from before but the issue with her visa was not about that. The Tsarnaevs were not radicals but transformed once they were in the US due to exposure to Jihadist propaganda over the internet.\n\n>And How many Americans are you willing to let die for the well being of a people that don't assimilate or conform to the nation's values? If the answer is zero then you cannot let any of them in.\n\nYou can keep saying this, but this is contrary to Christianity. It is part of right wing populism, though.\n\nFurthermore, just take a look at Canada and how its treating Syrian refugees. Yes, there are challenges with a relatively smaller population taking in refugees, but it's managing without the refugees being accused of radicalism or ghettoization or isolationism or lack of integration or setting up sharia courts.\n\nAnd if your idea of assimilation is for the women to stop wearing a hijab or for the Muslims to stop eating halal, that would be very hypocritical.\n\nThe problems you're seeing in Europe is because of 0 vetting due to 0 border control; a lot of those who do commit crimes aren't even Syrian refugees and turn out to be economic migrants. Canada vets the refugees it lets in; after all, there's no terrestrial way to enter Canada from Asia or Europe.\n\n>I submit to you the opposite in that there is no moral ground to take in refugees. Exhibit A\n\nYour \"Exhibit A\" is irrelevant to the refugee question. Now, if those \"refugees\" were all economic migrants, yeah, you'd have a point. Economic migrants aren't running for their lives. Refugees are. Taking in refugees isn't about an immigration policy. I mentioned Canada earlier. Canada has a very tough immigration policy. It is a lot easier to immigrate to the US than it is to Canada. But refugees do not go through this system. They are simply vetted based on security reasons alone.\n\n\n>2 Argumentum ad populum, even if you had some statistical evidence and not a NY Times article to prove it was true why should my or anyone else's opinion be swayed by a collective emotional and poorly thought out national security position?\n\n\nWhat are you even talking about?\n\nI was pointing out that evangelical Christians are one of the largest groups that accept refugees, privately sponsoring refugee families that arrive in the US and want increased refugee intake by the US. Many people think that evangelicals are one of the most right-wing and unmalleable types of Christians in the US, yet despite this, they are pro-refugee.

Most are coming from destabilized areas that are hazardous to live in because of the proliferation of ISIS and other terrorist groups. Some are taking advantage of the situation to get themselves/their family into a first world country where they will have opportunities that they don't have back home. A small number are ISIS members who intend to use the migration to get into first world countries. ISIS has already bragged about getting members into Germany and other European countries.\n\nWe have a few options of what to do being considered.\n\nThe first, which Hillary suggested, was to bring in 65,000 refugees every year. This comes with 2 issues. The first is that our background checks are ineffective since most of the people arriving don't have much background information to check. Many of them have had their records burned/destroyed in government/hospital buildings in their home countries. Others have stolen or used stolen ID printing machinery to falsify who they are so they can be allowed into first world countries. Since these records aren't on an online database, except for previously identified terrorists, we cannot know for certain who these people are or what criminal history they may have had back home. The second issue, is even if you disregard the safety risk, the cost per refugee in the US is $20,000 per year. In Jordan, or other countries we could possibly contract with to house the refugees, the cost is around $3,000 per refugee per year. We could house 6 refugees for less than the cost of 1 refugee in the US.\n\nTrump's plan was to create safe zones in Syria so that once the war had ended and ISIS had been pushed back, those people could retake their country and home. This would protect a much larger number of people as well as prevent the country from further collapsing on the remaining people still living in it, forcing millions more to migrate out of their countries.\n\nPeople who tell you that the \"other side\" wants to leave these people to die are intentionally being dishonest to you.", "id": "dalng1w"}, {"comment": "> Trump's plan was...\n\nDamn, you must be in the transition team meetings to have classified information like that.", "id": "dalqjre"}, {"comment": "Ahh, so it's the classic \"kill the dictator and allow the people to liberate themselves and form a new democratic government\" scenario, eh? \n\nWait, how did we get here again?

This wouldn't be done with either Clinton or Trump's plans.  The communities need to feel safe to volunteer information without being treated like a pariah.

However, any apologist worth his weight in salt will generally be able to challenge these pretty easily, usually with definition shenanigans. For example, here are some challenges I'd imagine one would present to each argument if they felt so inclined:\n\n\n**Perfection** - What does it mean to be made \"In Yahweh's Image\"? To be made in someone's image doesn't mean to be identical, so we can be \"like\" Yahweh without having all of his properties, such as perfection.\n\n\n**Omniscience** - Just because Yahweh *can* not know something doesn't mean that he *must* not know it.\n\n\n**Omnibenevolence** - One could define \"Hell\" as simply the absence of God, not something that he purposefully created for Satan and non-believers. In that case, the existence of a place called Hell would not negate his goodness. Also, Satan has not been forgiven because he hasn't asked to be forgiven (yes, this is a cop-out, because forgiveness is not dependent on the willingness of the other person to ask for it, but it's just a typical response I would expect).\n\n\n**Omnipresence** - Generally not a good idea to use scripture to support a proof... it can literally be taken in any context the other person chooses. If I were an apologist here, I'd simply call it a symbolic statement, not meant to reflect Yahweh's actual properties, and move on.\n\n\n**Omnipotence** - The apologist would simply move the goalposts here and say that omnipotence means he can do anything that is logically coherent. For example, he could not make 1+1=3 because that doesn't even make logical sense... he would simply be redefining what the number \"3\" means. A better approach would be to tie this back into omniscience. Can God change the future? If so, how can he possibly know what the future will be? Omniscience and Omnipotence are mutually exclusive.\n\n\nYou're on the right track, you just need to think like an apologist. The thing they're best at is redefining what any term means to best suit their argument at the time, and they do it so subtly that it's often hard to notice. You have to anticipate that and account for it ahead of time.\n\nIn other words, if you're going to make an argument against them, make sure all your definitions set in stone and ON THEIR TERMS beforehand. It'll make it much more difficult for them to move the goalposts later on."], [2, ">a long winded proof that disproves all of Yahweh's qualities then concludes that seeing as he does not fulfill his qualities he does not exist. \n\nI accept your proof as truth. Good work. "], [2, "Good attempt. I'm trying to avoid logical and epistemological arguments; I am trying to disprove YHWH using mathematics. "], [2, "I was a Christian for many years and folks I know would not have any problems answering your objections and conclusions.  Here is what they'd say ...\n\n> Perfection\n\n> 1) Yahweh is perfect.\n\n> 2) We are made in Yahweh's image.\n\n> 3) Our body is not perfect. (Disease, old age, the shape of the pelvis etc.)\n\n> C) Yahweh is not perfect.\n\nAs a result of the Fall where Adam & Eve rebelled against God; before that the body was perfect THEREFORE God is still perfect.\n\n> Omniscience (all knowingness)\n\n> 1) Yahweh is omniscient. \n\n> 2) Yahweh is omnipotent. (all powerful)\n\n> 3) Yahweh can not know something.\n\n> C) Yahweh is not omniscient.\n\nWhich is only conflicting if we define God's omnipotence without relation to his other attributes. This is similar to the argument, \"Can God create a stone he himself cannot lift?\" and the response is \"No, God is not 'omni' anything in the sense that it would negate any other attribute he has.\" \n\n\n> Omnibenevolence (all lovingness)\n\n> 1) Yahweh is omnibenevolent.\n\n> 2) Hell exists. \n\n> 3) Yahweh has still not forgiven Satan after millenia. \n\n> 4) Yahweh is not omnibenevolent.\n\nForgiveness does not imply nor require the absence of consequences for wrong doing.  For the Christian, even the most minor sin is worthy of eternal damnation, also there is no indication Satan has asked for forgiveness.  You can still love your child and yet punish them for being disobedient, no?  Thus, being completely just, God must punish for all eternity those who have sinned and he can only be omnibenevolent because said punishment was taken out on Jesus for those who believe.\n\n\n> Omnipresence (all presentness)\n\n> 1) Yahweh is omnipresent.\n\n> 2) 1 King 19:22 'the LORD was not in the wind'\n\n> 3) Yahweh is not omnipresent.\n\nChristians will reply that that text is to be taken metaphorically and cite passages where \"God not being with such and such\" is reflective of him not being there in the sense of having his blessing or him being with X as in a favorable way vs. not being present at all.  In the same way you might tell someone, \"I'm with on that\" ... which of course doesn't imply you are physically with that person.\n\n\n> Omnipotence (all powerfullness)\n\n> 1) Yahweh is omnipotent \n\n> 2) Omnipotence means to be able to do anything.\n\n> 3) Yahweh should be able to draw a square circle.\n\n> 4) A square circle is logically incoherent. \n\n> C) Yahweh is not omnipotent.\n\nSee above discussion on \"Omniscience\""], [1, "You seem to not know enough about the details of the Christian religion to make these arguments. For example, in the first one, you said Yahweh isn't perfect because we aren't perfect... But at first Adam and Eve were perfect, they were immortal, without sin,... until Satan fucked shit up.\nAlso, it is pointless to try to simplify arguments like that, it will never convince a Christian, especially if you overlook such important details.  Your conclusion isn't wrong though, and I advise you to read Epicurus on the omnipotency of a god"], [1, "Omnipotence: Can god make an object so heavy he could not move it?\n\nOmnipresents: Is God in hell?\n\nAll loving: Does god want to end immense natural suffering?"], [1, "This is a step on the way to noticing the Old Jewish Book of Fables is totally filled with logic contradictions.  The problem is this stage is using Dyslexic Logic, the \"Since this, then that\" approach. The problem is \"since this\" is already a conclusion.  For the holy-rollers, this works well to always have a counter passage to take out of context, and the old trick of only using the bible for bible reference.  That is why realizing this Abrahamic-god is the handiwork of a bunch of primitive, ignorant bronze age sheep and goat herders that drank so much wine, they called it blood, saves a lot of wasted time trying to derive sense from nonsense. Don't use Dyslexic Logic, don't start with a conclusion then try to work backward sense.  \n  \nAlways remember, this Abrahamic-god of approximately 3.5 billion human ground apes is not accepted by 3.8 billion human ground apes. Once the realization that Genesis 1:1 is factually incorrect sets in, a lot of time can be saved fearing this imaginary god."], [1, "As someone who is converting to Catholicism and discerning apologetics, I suppose this is a pretty good time to see how much I understand your arguments. Again, I am not converted, nor am I fully instructed, but these are my best attempts.\n\n>Perfection. \n\n>1) Yahweh is perfect.  \n>2) We are made in Yahweh's image.  \n>3) Our body is not perfect. (Disease, old age, the shape of the pelvis etc.)  \n>C) Yahweh is not perfect. \n\n'To be made in X's image' means to be a child of, not literally made to be physically similar (thus having the same image). The only other time the same words are used are in Genesis 5:3 as part of the second Creation of Mankind story, where Adam 'begat a son in his own likeness, and in his own image.'\n\n>Omniscience  (all knowingness)  \n\n>1) Yahweh is omniscient. \n>2) Yahweh is omnipotent. (all powerful)  \n>3) Yahweh *can* **not** know something.  \n>C) Yahweh is not omniscient.\n\nSimilar to omnipotence, this doesn't make logical sense. God is the Logos (from Greek for 'word,' the etymological root of logic and -logy), which the Church takes to understand as rational and ordered. It's the same approach as whether or not God would create an object so large and heavy He could not move it: of course not, because all of Creation is moving towards a rational, ordered end.\n\n>Omnibenevolence (all lovingness)\n\n>1) Yahweh is omnibenevolent.   \n>2) Hell exists. \n>3) Yahweh has *still* not forgiven Satan after millenia. \n>4) Yahweh is not omnibenevolent. \n\nHell is a state, not a physical presence, and while that might seem pedantic it's important to understand the difference. In Catholic theology there is singular predestination, which is to say that God wills all of mankind to be in heaven, but by merit of free will some people *choose* to reject God, and communion with the Trinity. That is what Last Judgement is: by revealing our thoughts and deeds, we are not judged to have been insufficient, rather the truth of what we desired for our life after death is made evident. Hell is the willed (by humans) separation from God. As for Satan, as the first being who willed for his separation from God, it is not a matter of forgiving him, but rather giving him what he wanted.\n\n>Omnipresence  (all presentness)\n\n>1) Yahweh is omnipresent.  \n>2) 1 King 19:22 'the LORD was not in the wind'  \n>3) Yahweh is not omnipresent.\n\nI mean, this is a pretty ticky tacky verse to use, considering it was designed to prove to Elijah a specific point. Elijah wanted a very violent and retributive response from God since he was being persecuted (hence invoking a very specific name, the Lord God of hosts). Rather God was trying to teach Elijah a lesson, which he didn't learn. To this I would also add what St. Thomas Aquinas said, that God is being itself (in Ipsum esse). God is not a thing, but is all things that can be said exist because God is existence itself.\n\n>Omnipotence  (all powerfullness)\n\n>1) Yahweh is omnipotent\n>2) Omnipotence means to be able to do anything.  \n>3) Yahweh should be able to draw a square circle.  \n>4) A square circle is logically incoherent.\n>C) Yahweh is not omnipotent. \n\nSee above.\n\nIf anything, I hope this provides for you more specifics to rebut.

You have to anticipate that and account for it ahead of time.\n\nIn other words, if you're going to make an argument against them, make sure all your definitions set in stone and ON THEIR TERMS beforehand. It'll make it much more difficult for them to move the goalposts later on.", "id": "dap9j1u"}], [{"comment": ">a long winded proof that disproves all of Yahweh's qualities then concludes that seeing as he does not fulfill his qualities he does not exist. \n\nI accept your proof as truth.

Here is what they'd say ...\n\n> Perfection\n\n> 1) Yahweh is perfect.\n\n> 2) We are made in Yahweh's image.\n\n> 3) Our body is not perfect. (Disease, old age, the shape of the pelvis etc.)\n\n> C) Yahweh is not perfect.\n\nAs a result of the Fall where Adam & Eve rebelled against God; before that the body was perfect THEREFORE God is still perfect.\n\n> Omniscience (all knowingness)\n\n> 1) Yahweh is omniscient. \n\n> 2) Yahweh is omnipotent. (all powerful)\n\n> 3) Yahweh can not know something.\n\n> C) Yahweh is not omniscient.\n\nWhich is only conflicting if we define God's omnipotence without relation to his other attributes. This is similar to the argument, \"Can God create a stone he himself cannot lift?\" and the response is \"No, God is not 'omni' anything in the sense that it would negate any other attribute he has.\" \n\n\n> Omnibenevolence (all lovingness)\n\n> 1) Yahweh is omnibenevolent.\n\n> 2) Hell exists. \n\n> 3) Yahweh has still not forgiven Satan after millenia. \n\n> 4) Yahweh is not omnibenevolent.\n\nForgiveness does not imply nor require the absence of consequences for wrong doing.  For the Christian, even the most minor sin is worthy of eternal damnation, also there is no indication Satan has asked for forgiveness.  You can still love your child and yet punish them for being disobedient, no?  Thus, being completely just, God must punish for all eternity those who have sinned and he can only be omnibenevolent because said punishment was taken out on Jesus for those who believe.\n\n\n> Omnipresence (all presentness)\n\n> 1) Yahweh is omnipresent.\n\n> 2) 1 King 19:22 'the LORD was not in the wind'\n\n> 3) Yahweh is not omnipresent.\n\nChristians will reply that that text is to be taken metaphorically and cite passages where \"God not being with such and such\" is reflective of him not being there in the sense of having his blessing or him being with X as in a favorable way vs. not being present at all.  In the same way you might tell someone, \"I'm with on that\" ... which of course doesn't imply you are physically with that person.\n\n\n> Omnipotence (all powerfullness)\n\n> 1) Yahweh is omnipotent \n\n> 2) Omnipotence means to be able to do anything.\n\n> 3) Yahweh should be able to draw a square circle.\n\n> 4) A square circle is logically incoherent. \n\n> C) Yahweh is not omnipotent.\n\nSee above discussion on \"Omniscience\"", "id": "dapr1p4"}], [{"comment": "You seem to not know enough about the details of the Christian religion to make these arguments.

That is why realizing this Abrahamic-god is the handiwork of a bunch of primitive, ignorant bronze age sheep and goat herders that drank so much wine, they called it blood, saves a lot of wasted time trying to derive sense from nonsense.

Again, I am not converted, nor am I fully instructed, but these are my best attempts.\n\n>Perfection. \n\n>1) Yahweh is perfect.  \n>2) We are made in Yahweh's image.  \n>3) Our body is not perfect. (Disease, old age, the shape of the pelvis etc.)  \n>C) Yahweh is not perfect. \n\n'To be made in X's image' means to be a child of, not literally made to be physically similar (thus having the same image). The only other time the same words are used are in Genesis 5:3 as part of the second Creation of Mankind story, where Adam 'begat a son in his own likeness, and in his own image.'\n\n>Omniscience  (all knowingness)  \n\n>1) Yahweh is omniscient. \n>2) Yahweh is omnipotent. (all powerful)  \n>3) Yahweh *can* **not** know something.  \n>C) Yahweh is not omniscient.\n\nSimilar to omnipotence, this doesn't make logical sense. God is the Logos (from Greek for 'word,' the etymological root of logic and -logy), which the Church takes to understand as rational and ordered. It's the same approach as whether or not God would create an object so large and heavy He could not move it: of course not, because all of Creation is moving towards a rational, ordered end.\n\n>Omnibenevolence (all lovingness)\n\n>1) Yahweh is omnibenevolent.   \n>2) Hell exists. \n>3) Yahweh has *still* not forgiven Satan after millenia. \n>4) Yahweh is not omnibenevolent. \n\nHell is a state, not a physical presence, and while that might seem pedantic it's important to understand the difference. In Catholic theology there is singular predestination, which is to say that God wills all of mankind to be in heaven, but by merit of free will some people *choose* to reject God, and communion with the Trinity. That is what Last Judgement is: by revealing our thoughts and deeds, we are not judged to have been insufficient, rather the truth of what we desired for our life after death is made evident. Hell is the willed (by humans) separation from God. As for Satan, as the first being who willed for his separation from God, it is not a matter of forgiving him, but rather giving him what he wanted.\n\n>Omnipresence  (all presentness)\n\n>1) Yahweh is omnipresent.  \n>2) 1 King 19:22 'the LORD was not in the wind'  \n>3) Yahweh is not omnipresent.\n\nI mean, this is a pretty ticky tacky verse to use, considering it was designed to prove to Elijah a specific point. Elijah wanted a very violent and retributive response from God since he was being persecuted (hence invoking a very specific name, the Lord God of hosts). Rather God was trying to teach Elijah a lesson, which he didn't learn. To this I would also add what St. Thomas Aquinas said, that God is being itself (in Ipsum esse). God is not a thing, but is all things that can be said exist because God is existence itself.\n\n>Omnipotence  (all powerfullness)\n\n>1) Yahweh is omnipotent\n>2) Omnipotence means to be able to do anything.  \n>3) Yahweh should be able to draw a square circle.  \n>4) A square circle is logically incoherent.\n>C) Yahweh is not omnipotent. \n\nSee above.\n\nIf anything, I hope this provides for you more specifics to rebut.

Life on Earth seems to have developed quickly, perhaps as early as [4.1 billion years](http://www.iflscience.com/environment/life-earth-started-remarkably-close-planets-fiery-formation/) ago, only some 300 million years after the Earth which means it developed almost as soon as the planet cooled enough to allow life to survive.\n\nHowever, intelligent life is more problematic. It took about 3 billion years for life to progress from single cellular to multicellular forms which suggests this step is extremely difficult and improbable. \n\nAnother impediment is that intelligent life capable of complex technology developing even from larger creatures is also rare. If not for an asteroid killing off the dinosaurs 65 billion years ago it is unlikely Earth would have any intelligent life now as the dinosaurs were probably biologically incapable of evolving to our level of intelligence. They certainly never managed to in the ~180 million years they dominated the Earth, while mammals went from small shrews to *Homo sapiens* in only 65 million. \n\nThirdly, having developed intelligence life needs to avoid the consequent pitfalls such as high technology warfare and climate change. It increasingly looks likely we will fail to solve these threats to our survival.\n\nSo while life may be abundant throughout the cosmos, intelligent, technology driven civilizations are probably very, very rare, perhaps only a handful in the entire Universe.

Life on Earth seems to have developed quickly, perhaps as early as [4.1 billion years](http://www.iflscience.com/environment/life-earth-started-remarkably-close-planets-fiery-formation/) ago, only some 300 million years after the Earth which means it developed almost as soon as the planet cooled enough to allow life to survive.\n\nHowever, intelligent life is more problematic. It took about 3 billion years for life to progress from single cellular to multicellular forms which suggests this step is extremely difficult and improbable. \n\nAnother impediment is that intelligent life capable of complex technology developing even from larger creatures is also rare. If not for an asteroid killing off the dinosaurs 65 billion years ago it is unlikely Earth would have any intelligent life now as the dinosaurs were probably biologically incapable of evolving to our level of intelligence. They certainly never managed to in the ~180 million years they dominated the Earth, while mammals went from small shrews to *Homo sapiens* in only 65 million. \n\nThirdly, having developed intelligence life needs to avoid the consequent pitfalls such as high technology warfare and climate change. It increasingly looks likely we will fail to solve these threats to our survival.\n\nSo while life may be abundant throughout the cosmos, intelligent, technology driven civilizations are probably very, very rare, perhaps only a handful in the entire Universe.

As you use this brain in certain ways, the hardware reacts to the stimulous it received and grows and reinforces connections to better support the kinds of things you do during your time awake. It essentially rewires itself and changes over time with most of that change happening while you sleep.\n\nNow, this all happens due to external stimulous, but can be affected by internal stimulous as well. When a neuron fires that propagates a signal to other nerves based on a biochemical weight stored in that cell. That cell does not have the ability to decide when or if it is to fire, that is from the combinations of weights, connections, and the results of new stimulous comming into that cell. The wiring that previously formed dictates the pathways the propagation can take and the weights that were previously stored by lifes prior experiances,  and serve to preen out signals. All that history created the brain you have now. Tomorrow it may react slightly differently due to minor changes in that infrastructure. Stimulus in, pattern of conductivity and structure out.\n\nNow, can you please point out where the \"self\" resides that has the power to instantly restructure your brain? Whthout changing structure you do not have control over what you are going to think 3 seconds from now, and your reaction to that future stimulus only has certain pathways to take all based on your biological history. \n\nAny thought you have now is driven by this circuitry you have built up over the years. You do not have the option to force signals to propagate where their is no pathway. You have only limited control over the signals pathway such as by throwing up interference stimuli to change the inevitable outcome your existing wiring will take. You have little choice in how your brain will respond, other than by adding or subtracting self induced stimuli. \n\nPeople often confuse \"new thoughts\" with having \"free will\", because your current thought is not your previous thought. That new thought came from new stimuli confined to the neural map that is the current you. Thinking about free will can again slowly change that map over time, and thus how the future brain will react to a conversation on that topic. You will always react based on the hardware of the current you at the time, not some othweer you that one might wish they could be.

As you use this brain in certain ways, the hardware reacts to the stimulous it received and grows and reinforces connections to better support the kinds of things you do during your time awake. It essentially rewires itself and changes over time with most of that change happening while you sleep.\n\nNow, this all happens due to external stimulous, but can be affected by internal stimulous as well. When a neuron fires that propagates a signal to other nerves based on a biochemical weight stored in that cell. That cell does not have the ability to decide when or if it is to fire, that is from the combinations of weights, connections, and the results of new stimulous comming into that cell. The wiring that previously formed dictates the pathways the propagation can take and the weights that were previously stored by lifes prior experiances,  and serve to preen out signals. All that history created the brain you have now. Tomorrow it may react slightly differently due to minor changes in that infrastructure. Stimulus in, pattern of conductivity and structure out.\n\nNow, can you please point out where the \"self\" resides that has the power to instantly restructure your brain? Whthout changing structure you do not have control over what you are going to think 3 seconds from now, and your reaction to that future stimulus only has certain pathways to take all based on your biological history. \n\nAny thought you have now is driven by this circuitry you have built up over the years. You do not have the option to force signals to propagate where their is no pathway. You have only limited control over the signals pathway such as by throwing up interference stimuli to change the inevitable outcome your existing wiring will take. You have little choice in how your brain will respond, other than by adding or subtracting self induced stimuli. \n\nPeople often confuse \"new thoughts\" with having \"free will\", because your current thought is not your previous thought. That new thought came from new stimuli confined to the neural map that is the current you. Thinking about free will can again slowly change that map over time, and thus how the future brain will react to a conversation on that topic. You will always react based on the hardware of the current you at the time, not some othweer you that one might wish they could be. Only that \"wish\" program is currently running on the wetware brain that is the current you and it will do what nature encoded into its physical  programming. \n", "id": "dard7pl"}, {"comment": "This is a nice explanation, thank you for taking the time to write that.\nI only have one question, would you now say that people have free will, or is it rather a certain behavior based on the stucture of your braincells,  a thought being \"your own thought\"?

Our local self proclaimed service dog trainer is 1500/week board and train, min of 3 weeks. She uses dominance training and used a prong collar incorrectly on our reactive dog.. 60/30min sessions. She is recommended by everyone. And the dogs she trains for service really should not have public access, at least not as soon as they're done.. Our closest trainer I actually think I can trust and knows what she's doing is a few hours away and usually pretty booked. She does the Dog Speak seminars, and she's amazing but her sessions cost much more. After the training expenses on a dog that may wash anyways I may be spending about that much anyways unfortunately. \nThe go fund me thing freaks me out because I was always the weird kid in school.

I know one could really help me but I've seen others just tear people apart in those groups for asking questions, questions I might have asked. For now I'll just keep saving money and fostering. I foster through AC from time to time when I find a dog that might be a good fit. One day. Lol", "id": "daoxm0g"}, {"comment": "> How in the heck did training cost so little?\n\nMy trainer wasn't a specialist in training service dogs, she was just individually really good at training a dog to do pretty much anything the owner wants. I took her to a class once a week where the trainer didn't train the dog so much as trained me in how to train my dog. I did a lot of research about what exactly I wanted my dog to do and with the trainers help and suggestions succeeded in that, My dog knows basic obedience, some useful commands that might be considered to go beyond \"basic\" like \"go potty\", as well as her service dog tasks. A trainer that simply trains your dog for you can be helpful, but being a handler takes some training too and I think if the two train together it helps make a better bond. \n\n> She uses dominance training\n\nYeah, negative training like that doesn't work well at all. Sadly it's super common. Sometimes it works, but most of the time you just traumatize the poor dog, even if it works actually.\n\n> dogs she trains for service really should not have public access\n\nNot surprising.\n\n> training expenses on a dog that may wash anyways\n\nThis is a risk. Its one reason against owner training because you form this great bond and then discover that something you need the dog to do the dog can't do. Most service dogs I know are owner trained, for a variety of disabilities both invisible and visible and their owners have never had one wash out. I think its pretty rare if you pick a good dog. Picking the right dog is the real tricky part I think. Dogs are really smart and if training is consistent can usually learn anything you'd like. Time is also a factor of course. How long can you devote to training? My dog is a chihuahua which is said to be one of the smartest breeds so training her was really easy. Dogs aren't robots though, no matter if they come from a program or are owner trained they will have bad days where they just can't focus and sometimes you have to change your life to suit them. One girl I know, her dog is a great help to her and very well behaved but he doesn't do well in movie theaters because he's suppose to alert to things that may be on screen. So she doesn't go to the theater to watch films. You can't blame a dog for doing his job too well lol.\n\n> I know one could really help me but I've seen others just tear people apart in those groups for asking questions\n\nYes, its really sad. When I was first doing research I made a phone call to a program to ask some questions and they accused me of faking because if I was really disabled I'd already know everything. Which makes no sense. I never called another program, but I had the thought that if I did I'd simply pretend to be the mother of a disabled person, rather than myself. Maybe that wouldn't get as much hate.\n\n> you can't tell I have a disability. I feel like I'm going to have to tell people.\n\nA service dog is a life saver. It also is an attention grabber. You have to quickly get use to intrusive questions every time you leave the house. Friendly people will want to pet the dog and exclaim how cute they are.  You will get caught in conversations with many well meaning people answering the same questions \"how old are they? How much do they weigh? What's their name?\" and you will be discriminated against because of the dog, you will get hate and you will get pity. It is worth it. It does take some getting use to. Friendly people become just as annoying as mean people. I just want to buy some damn tomato sauce damn it! not have the same conversation 20 times on my way to the can isle. You get use to simply ignoring people and keep walking. Having an invisible disability causes people to say \"you don't look disabled.\" or say \"its so cool you're training them for a disabled person.\" It's actually kinda fun to think up snarky replies to people. \n\nStranger: Oh he's so cute!(my dog is  a girl)\n\nMe: Thanks I've been dating him for 5 years.(as I place my hand on my boyfriend's shoulder.)\n\nStranger: He's cute too!(its nice when they get the clue and play along)\n\nand when people shout \"That aint no damn service dog!\" its stressful. I tend to walk in the opposite direction of security people in fear of being hassled. But having her is still worth it. My dog makes the world tolerable.\n\n>  I feel guilty trying to raise money for a dog so publicly like that when you can't tell I have a disability.\n\nI'm autistic. People in my life know this because I self identify as such and am very proud of it. I am entitled to  service dog because of various issues pertaining to autism(and the not so publicly known information that I also have ptsd), but I don't \"look\" disabled and have had to deal with people demanding me \"why can't you just be normal!\" as if I can just flip a little switch and go into neurotypical mode. Since I've been autistic from birth I've gotten use to idiots and learned to fight for what I need. Its not easy, and because we are invisible we have to fight even against other disabled people.

And homosexuals.\n\nYou're broadening the scope of my original argument which was simply that shoving *any* beliefs in someones face is...  Crap.  Whether it's atheism or some spiritual belief.\n\nWhile I waiver between bu-jew, atheist and agnostic I do my best to respect other peoples beliefs and accept that other people are not \"less\" or \"stupid\" because they don't believe what I do.  It's something old folks like me used to call \"differing like a gentleman\".  Being respectful and focusing on the intellectual parts of an argument rather than the emotional.\n\nAnd there's more to religion than zealotry.  For instance, my father was Jewish, he died when I was a child, and celebrating the Jewish holidays gives me a connection with him.  This is important to me because I never knew him.  Even if I don't believe the story of Moses as literal, I love celebrating Passover for reasons of tradition and continuity which extend far beyond any literal belief in the bible.\n\nI lived in Israel for a time.  I learned much about what hate and intolerance look like there.

In Jerusalem.  With Jews.  Muslims.  Xtians.  It's no different in the way it manifests itself behaviorally.  And in that way \"fundamentalist atheists\" are becoming the monster they say they're so keen on slaying.\n\nIn short I don't care what anyone believes.  So long as they don't shove their beliefs in my face and tell me they're better then me.  It saddens me to see this in atheism, but that kind of caustic attitude is also a hallmark of our times.  And it saddens me to see it anywhere.

The fact that people can and do strongly disagree about the issues concerning abortion is the very reason abortion has been chosen as the subject. \n\n     The issues surrounding abortion are not just \"yes or now\" or \"either/or\".  There are people with differing levels of support for being anti-abortion (a/k/a \"pro life\") and/or being pro-choice.  Some people who are pro-choice make an exception for late term abortions and find those objectionable.  Some people who are anti-choice are willing to make exceptions for either rape and/or incest and/or the life of the mother and/or the physical health of the mother or even for both the physical and/or mental health of the mother.  \n\nANTI-CHOICE   \n\n     I.  There are people who are entirely anti-choice that strongly believe all abortions should be prohibited by law, without exception.  Among the reaons for that belief, the anti-choice people include:   \n\n         A.  Anti-choice people have a willingness to accept and cause the imposition of governmental tyranny:  People who are entirely anti-choice have within them a willingness to accept political/governmental tyranny over the personal lives of its citizens -- at least over the personal lives of OTHER citizens if the citizens are pregnant women -- that those that are pro-choice simply do not have -- at least not on this issue.  \n\n             1.  Anti-choice people have a strong belief in their own right to use our US government to impose tyranny -- their flavor of tyranny:  For whatever their individual reasons -- personal and/or emotional and/or religious and/or political beliefs -- the anti-choice people believe they have a right to require government impose their anti-choice beliefs on women making some of the most important and lifelong consequential decisions any woman can ever make -- reproduction. \n\n             2.  Anti-choice people have a belief in their right to deny freedom/individual liberty to others: The anti-choice people have a personal and political mindset that, for whatever reason (sometimes religious), makes them very willing to deny a pregnant woman her own right to individual liberty soley because the anti-choice people choose to believe that a fetus is a baby rather than nascant life.    It matters not to the anti-choice people what the beliefs of the pregnant woman are or how deeply held the pregnant woman's own beliefs may be or what the surrounding circumstances may be. \n \n         B.  Anti-choice people define murder:  Because of their deeply held beliefs  -- likely beliefs  they've been taught since childhood -- they believe a fetus, at any stage of development, is a already baby ...  so, therefore, they believe that removing it from the womb, ending it's potential to become a baby, would be murder.   \n\n         C.  Anti-choice people make decisions based upon emotion:  Because the anti-choice people cannot understand why any woman would not love and want their own baby, it is beyond their comprehension that any good and sane person would not want carry the fetus to full term and either embrace and raise the baby after giving birth -- or at least place it for adoption -- as they, the anti-choice people, living in a land of freedom with their own right to individual liberty would choose to do.\n\n         D.  Anti-choice people believe they have the right to decide which lives have more value than others:  Believing a fetus to be a living baby, the anti-choice people that are determined to ban all abortions without exception -- including the life/health of the mother --  choose believe they have some right to assign more value to the life of the fetus than to the pregnant woman and assign more right to the fetus -- according to their  judgment as to what is right -- than they do to the rights of the pregnant woman.\n"], [1, "Part II of III:\n\n PRO-CHOICE\n       \n     II. Some people are pro-choice-- which is NOT the same thing as pro-abortion.  Unlike the anti-choice people, the pro-choice people do not seek to force others to make the same perosnal reproductive choices they would consider or make themselves.  \n\n         A.   Some people are pro choice because of a strongly held belief in individual liberty:  Even while some pro-choice people may notwant their own offspring aborted --they believe every woman should be able to make that choice for themselves.  In a nation of free people, each of us should be entitled to make the most important and most consequential decisions about our own personal lives, without government intervention, without church intervention and without the meddling of other citizens.  A woman having the right to make to make her own reproductive choices, including having the option of a legal abortion, is about nothing less than freedom itself:\n\n         B.  Before abortions were not legal, they were very often unsafe for the woman.  \n\n             1.  Keeping abortion legal enables it to be safe and actually saves the lives of some of the women having abortions. Abortion accomplished as medical procedure performed in sanitary conditions by competent medical professionals help protect the life patient having the abortion.  \n\n             2.  Pro-choice people believe that protecting the lives of pregnant women is pro-life.\n\n             3.  Keeping abortion legal and safe can also make the difference between whether or not the woman having the abortion could be injured during the procedure and, therefore, can make the difference between whether or not the woman can bear children at a later date -- protecting her individual liberty yet again.\n\n                 (a)  Pro-choice people tend to believe that keeping the woman healthy enough to have a family if and when she's ready is a good \"family value\".\n  \n         C.  Pro-choice people tend to believe that protecting the health of women includes both physical and mental health.\n\n             1.  The potential for lifelong adverse consequences to the mental health of a woman -- and her family -- from forcing a woman to give birth to a baby born of rape or incest is very real.  \n\n                 (a)  In dozens of states, rapists can be granted parental rights.  Forcing a woman to hand over her a baby she loves to a man that raped her even for visitation much less custody, is, arguably, more cruel than any legal punishment US law allows.  \n\n                 (b)  Forcing a woman that wants a family of her own -- wants children -- to make the choice to either keep a child born of rape or incest knowing the potential visitation/custody issues and/or being reminded of the rape each time she looks at the child or placing the child in \"the system\" for adoption and forever wondering about the fate of her child is also horribly cruel.\n\n         D.   Pro-choice people tend to believe that they, not anti-choice \"thers -- and certainly not government --  should make both health and reproductive related decisions for themselves and their children -- and that includes as a fetus in the mother's womb.  Mothers (parents) do made decisions for their children -- denying a woman the right to make such decisions for nine months prior to birth is nonsensical.   \n\n         E. Pro-choice people tend to embrace logic and reason and, specifically including with regard to the abortion issue, equal right under law for each woman to make her own reproductive choices -- whether the woman chooses to have an abortion or choses not to have an abortion.  Pro-choice people are more likely to embrace science and to reject the hypocracy of any argument that seeks to deny a woman individual liberty.  Pro-choice people can be every bit as compassionate as any anti-choice people -- even if that compassion is interpreted differently such as whether or not to support the right of others in pain and dying from a fatal condition to either fight for every breath of life or choose the right to die with dignity. \n\n            1.  A pregnant woman seeking an abortion either to protect herself and her family -- including so no child to which she gives birth is stillborn or will endure lifelong mental and/or physical pain -- regardless of the duration of that life --  is acting out of compassion.\n\n            2. A pregnant woman seeking an abortion rather than bring a child into her personal life situation at any given point in time may well be both a selfish act on the part of the pregnant woman but also an action of compassion for the fetus that would become a child.    \n\n            3. Pro-choice people tend to believe that if you accept the anti-choice \"life begins at conception\" argument -- that a cluster of cells that can become a human being is a baby -- then you could not, in good conscience (without hypocrisy), even amputate a leg with gangrene in the thigh since it containes cells that could, potentially at least, be cloned as Dolly the sheep was cloned.\n\n            4. Some people that are pro choice make a distinction between a barely developed fetus and a fully developed or nearly fully developed fetus that could be delivered early and live outside the womb (with or without extensive medical care, depending upon how developed the fetus may be -- opinions vary and science is a consideration) and may, therefore, they may well be pro-choice but still oppose partial birth -- late term -- abortions.\n\n            5. Some pro-choice people believe that if you accept the anti-choice argument that abortion interferes with \"nature\" or \"god-given life\", then you cannot, without hypocrisy, interfere in any way with \"natural\" life or death -- including going to the doctor when you're sick or injured.\n     \n             6. Some pro-choice people believe that if you accept the anti-choice religious argument that religion forbids abortion because a fetus is \"life\" (rather than nascent life) and you believe that all life is \"sacred\" or that knowingly or willingly ending the potential for a fetus to become a baby is murder, then you could not, in good conscience (without hypocrisy), ever defend yourself or your family or your nation if it meant killing another person -- whose life would also be \"sacred\", especially if your religion is one that teaches its children to be meek and forgiving and \"turn the other cheek\".  That would also mean that you could not support the death penalty -- no matter how vile the crime.  Any vote for any government official that is pro-military would make you complicit in any death of any civlian as the \"murder\" or taking of a life, equally \"sacred\".  When you start deciding which lives are or are not expendable on religious grounds, you run afoul of the admonition:  \"judge not that ye be not judged\".\n\n     "], [1, "Part III of III:\n\n\n     \n\n      III.  Religion:  Many pro-choice people are religious; others are not.  Because of political activism, it appears most anti-choice people are religious; therefore, while some people may be anti-choice without being religious, for any religious person to argue that their being a part of the anti-choice movement -- the anti-women's rights movement -- the anti-individual liberty movement -- is a somehow just a \"legal\" or \"science\" issue lacks sincerity. \n\n            1.  All of society's religions are based upon verbal and/or written stories/texts (oft described as \"holy\") that were interpreted and written and published and edited and distributed and  again interpreted by men who sought to use those stories/texts to influence how others lived their lives (i.e. Ten Commandments, etc.).  Whether or not those repeating the messages of religion have sincerely believed in all the information they distributed or the information was distributed in pursuit of personal power and influence, the reality is the same:  All religions -- every flavor of them -- are, therefore, clearly man -- as made power tools -- fueled by fear (fear of the unknown; fear of hell) and need (to quell the fear; to know answers) and greed -- ((pursuit of influence/power; lust for power, including (via tithing and donations) the power of money)).  \n\n            2.  After many generations of teaching small children religious dogma when they were totally dependant upon those teaching them and vulnerable to the power of suggestion -- and using threats of hell and promises of a desirable reward -- heaven -- using ear and need and greed -- and doing so while having the ability to limit ther information flow to the children, many of those children are now adults with a kind of blind and unquestioning faith that what they've been taught is unquestionably true.  There is nothing about blind obedience to religious dogma that equates to freedom.\n\n     CONCLUSION \n\n     Those anti-choice people with unquestionable faith that THEIR OWN beliefs are the only \"right\" beliefs ( whether or not religiously motivated ) now seek to impose those beliefs on others by rule of law, enforced by the full power of government.  Some anti-choice people even seek to criminalize not abiding by those \"laws\" rooted in the anti-choice beliefs.  Some anti-choice people even seek to imprison those who seek to exercise their individual liberty by choosing to act on their own pro-choice beliefs.  That is unacceptable.  The very essence of freedom is individual liberty and equal right under law -- my right to choose my path in life is equal to your right to choose your path.  Anti-choice is anti-freedom.\n\n     \nHope it helps.\n\nGood luck."], [1, "> threw in the whole double homicide argument \n\nI have no idea what this means.

I chose the other path. Think of me as a lawyer. A lawyer will defend a murderer or a thief. It is his job; it is not that he'll vote for a law for theft to be abolished as a crime. Until the end of this lesson, I'll fulfil the role of defending the position I've taken for this speech. However, you (point to the students or nod as that is less threatening) can pick only one role of two roles. You can take the role of the pro-life lawyer or the judge. If you take the role of the pro-life lawyer, you can't judge me. If you take the role of judge, you can't attack my speech; you value the arguments brought forward. And in either role, you should look at the case, not me. There's one person who is in charge of that, and that's him (point to the teacher; which automatically pays respect to him).\n\nBert\nWhen a woman tries to conceive and she is a few days late and the gets her period, she's a bit disappointed that it didn't work this month but shrugs her shoulder Next month better, perhaps.\nWhen misses her period for two months and has another period, she is s a woman has a miscarriage, she quite disappointed. No candles will be burned in the trash can containing the sanitary pad.\nWhen a woman loses her child at 6 months, she's emotionally shaken. \nWhen a woman loses her child during birth, it will get a burial. \nThere is a gradual increase in emotional attachment. With abortion, the line is drawn, where the woman is not a captive breeding machine but can't change her mind after a certain period that should be long enough to take this hard decision. In any case a person is free to draw the line for herself at conception. \nWhere religion is involved, it should only hold for people who accept that religion as their own.

The fact that people can and do strongly disagree about the issues concerning abortion is the very reason abortion has been chosen as the subject. \n\n     The issues surrounding abortion are not just \"yes or now\" or \"either/or\".  There are people with differing levels of support for being anti-abortion (a/k/a \"pro life\") and/or being pro-choice.  Some people who are pro-choice make an exception for late term abortions and find those objectionable.  Some people who are anti-choice are willing to make exceptions for either rape and/or incest and/or the life of the mother and/or the physical health of the mother or even for both the physical and/or mental health of the mother.  \n\nANTI-CHOICE   \n\n     I.  There are people who are entirely anti-choice that strongly believe all abortions should be prohibited by law, without exception.  Among the reaons for that belief, the anti-choice people include:   \n\n         A.  Anti-choice people have a willingness to accept and cause the imposition of governmental tyranny:  People who are entirely anti-choice have within them a willingness to accept political/governmental tyranny over the personal lives of its citizens -- at least over the personal lives of OTHER citizens if the citizens are pregnant women -- that those that are pro-choice simply do not have -- at least not on this issue.  \n\n             1.  Anti-choice people have a strong belief in their own right to use our US government to impose tyranny -- their flavor of tyranny:  For whatever their individual reasons -- personal and/or emotional and/or religious and/or political beliefs -- the anti-choice people believe they have a right to require government impose their anti-choice beliefs on women making some of the most important and lifelong consequential decisions any woman can ever make -- reproduction. \n\n             2.  Anti-choice people have a belief in their right to deny freedom/individual liberty to others: The anti-choice people have a personal and political mindset that, for whatever reason (sometimes religious), makes them very willing to deny a pregnant woman her own right to individual liberty soley because the anti-choice people choose to believe that a fetus is a baby rather than nascant life.    It matters not to the anti-choice people what the beliefs of the pregnant woman are or how deeply held the pregnant woman's own beliefs may be or what the surrounding circumstances may be. \n \n         B.  Anti-choice people define murder:  Because of their deeply held beliefs  -- likely beliefs  they've been taught since childhood -- they believe a fetus, at any stage of development, is a already baby ...  so, therefore, they believe that removing it from the womb, ending it's potential to become a baby, would be murder.   \n\n         C.  Anti-choice people make decisions based upon emotion:  Because the anti-choice people cannot understand why any woman would not love and want their own baby, it is beyond their comprehension that any good and sane person would not want carry the fetus to full term and either embrace and raise the baby after giving birth -- or at least place it for adoption -- as they, the anti-choice people, living in a land of freedom with their own right to individual liberty would choose to do.\n\n         D.  Anti-choice people believe they have the right to decide which lives have more value than others:  Believing a fetus to be a living baby, the anti-choice people that are determined to ban all abortions without exception -- including the life/health of the mother --  choose believe they have some right to assign more value to the life of the fetus than to the pregnant woman and assign more right to the fetus -- according to their  judgment as to what is right -- than they do to the rights of the pregnant woman.\n", "id": "daog4mr"}], [{"comment": "Part II of III:\n\n PRO-CHOICE\n       \n     II. Some people are pro-choice-- which is NOT the same thing as pro-abortion.  Unlike the anti-choice people, the pro-choice people do not seek to force others to make the same perosnal reproductive choices they would consider or make themselves.  \n\n         A.   Some people are pro choice because of a strongly held belief in individual liberty:  Even while some pro-choice people may notwant their own offspring aborted --they believe every woman should be able to make that choice for themselves.  In a nation of free people, each of us should be entitled to make the most important and most consequential decisions about our own personal lives, without government intervention, without church intervention and without the meddling of other citizens.  A woman having the right to make to make her own reproductive choices, including having the option of a legal abortion, is about nothing less than freedom itself:\n\n         B.  Before abortions were not legal, they were very often unsafe for the woman.  \n\n             1.  Keeping abortion legal enables it to be safe and actually saves the lives of some of the women having abortions. Abortion accomplished as medical procedure performed in sanitary conditions by competent medical professionals help protect the life patient having the abortion.  \n\n             2.  Pro-choice people believe that protecting the lives of pregnant women is pro-life.\n\n             3.  Keeping abortion legal and safe can also make the difference between whether or not the woman having the abortion could be injured during the procedure and, therefore, can make the difference between whether or not the woman can bear children at a later date -- protecting her individual liberty yet again.\n\n                 (a)  Pro-choice people tend to believe that keeping the woman healthy enough to have a family if and when she's ready is a good \"family value\".\n  \n         C.  Pro-choice people tend to believe that protecting the health of women includes both physical and mental health.\n\n             1.  The potential for lifelong adverse consequences to the mental health of a woman -- and her family -- from forcing a woman to give birth to a baby born of rape or incest is very real.  \n\n                 (a)  In dozens of states, rapists can be granted parental rights.  Forcing a woman to hand over her a baby she loves to a man that raped her even for visitation much less custody, is, arguably, more cruel than any legal punishment US law allows.  \n\n                 (b)  Forcing a woman that wants a family of her own -- wants children -- to make the choice to either keep a child born of rape or incest knowing the potential visitation/custody issues and/or being reminded of the rape each time she looks at the child or placing the child in \"the system\" for adoption and forever wondering about the fate of her child is also horribly cruel.\n\n         D.   Pro-choice people tend to believe that they, not anti-choice \"thers -- and certainly not government --  should make both health and reproductive related decisions for themselves and their children -- and that includes as a fetus in the mother's womb.  Mothers (parents) do made decisions for their children -- denying a woman the right to make such decisions for nine months prior to birth is nonsensical.   \n\n         E. Pro-choice people tend to embrace logic and reason and, specifically including with regard to the abortion issue, equal right under law for each woman to make her own reproductive choices -- whether the woman chooses to have an abortion or choses not to have an abortion.  Pro-choice people are more likely to embrace science and to reject the hypocracy of any argument that seeks to deny a woman individual liberty.  Pro-choice people can be every bit as compassionate as any anti-choice people -- even if that compassion is interpreted differently such as whether or not to support the right of others in pain and dying from a fatal condition to either fight for every breath of life or choose the right to die with dignity. \n\n            1.  A pregnant woman seeking an abortion either to protect herself and her family -- including so no child to which she gives birth is stillborn or will endure lifelong mental and/or physical pain -- regardless of the duration of that life --  is acting out of compassion.\n\n            2. A pregnant woman seeking an abortion rather than bring a child into her personal life situation at any given point in time may well be both a selfish act on the part of the pregnant woman but also an action of compassion for the fetus that would become a child.    \n\n            3. Pro-choice people tend to believe that if you accept the anti-choice \"life begins at conception\" argument -- that a cluster of cells that can become a human being is a baby -- then you could not, in good conscience (without hypocrisy), even amputate a leg with gangrene in the thigh since it containes cells that could, potentially at least, be cloned as Dolly the sheep was cloned.\n\n            4. Some people that are pro choice make a distinction between a barely developed fetus and a fully developed or nearly fully developed fetus that could be delivered early and live outside the womb (with or without extensive medical care, depending upon how developed the fetus may be -- opinions vary and science is a consideration) and may, therefore, they may well be pro-choice but still oppose partial birth -- late term -- abortions.\n\n            5. Some pro-choice people believe that if you accept the anti-choice argument that abortion interferes with \"nature\" or \"god-given life\", then you cannot, without hypocrisy, interfere in any way with \"natural\" life or death -- including going to the doctor when you're sick or injured.\n     \n             6. Some pro-choice people believe that if you accept the anti-choice religious argument that religion forbids abortion because a fetus is \"life\" (rather than nascent life) and you believe that all life is \"sacred\" or that knowingly or willingly ending the potential for a fetus to become a baby is murder, then you could not, in good conscience (without hypocrisy), ever defend yourself or your family or your nation if it meant killing another person -- whose life would also be \"sacred\", especially if your religion is one that teaches its children to be meek and forgiving and \"turn the other cheek\".  That would also mean that you could not support the death penalty -- no matter how vile the crime.  Any vote for any government official that is pro-military would make you complicit in any death of any civlian as the \"murder\" or taking of a life, equally \"sacred\".  When you start deciding which lives are or are not expendable on religious grounds, you run afoul of the admonition:  \"judge not that ye be not judged\".\n\n     ", "id": "daog51p"}], [{"comment": "Part III of III:\n\n\n     \n\n      III.

All of society's religions are based upon verbal and/or written stories/texts (oft described as \"holy\") that were interpreted and written and published and edited and distributed and  again interpreted by men who sought to use those stories/texts to influence how others lived their lives (i.e. Ten Commandments, etc.).  Whether or not those repeating the messages of religion have sincerely believed in all the information they distributed or the information was distributed in pursuit of personal power and influence, the reality is the same:  All religions -- every flavor of them -- are, therefore, clearly man -- as made power tools -- fueled by fear (fear of the unknown; fear of hell) and need (to quell the fear; to know answers) and greed -- ((pursuit of influence/power; lust for power, including (via tithing and donations) the power of money)).  \n\n            2.  After many generations of teaching small children religious dogma when they were totally dependant upon those teaching them and vulnerable to the power of suggestion -- and using threats of hell and promises of a desirable reward -- heaven -- using ear and need and greed -- and doing so while having the ability to limit ther information flow to the children, many of those children are now adults with a kind of blind and unquestioning faith that what they've been taught is unquestionably true.  There is nothing about blind obedience to religious dogma that equates to freedom.\n\n     CONCLUSION \n\n     Those anti-choice people with unquestionable faith that THEIR OWN beliefs are the only \"right\" beliefs ( whether or not religiously motivated ) now seek to impose those beliefs on others by rule of law, enforced by the full power of government.  Some anti-choice people even seek to criminalize not abiding by those \"laws\" rooted in the anti-choice beliefs.  Some anti-choice people even seek to imprison those who seek to exercise their individual liberty by choosing to act on their own pro-choice beliefs.  That is unacceptable.  The very essence of freedom is individual liberty and equal right under law -- my right to choose my path in life is equal to your right to choose your path.  Anti-choice is anti-freedom.\n\n     \nHope it helps.\n\nGood luck.", "id": "daog625"}, {"comment": "Thank you!", "id": "daogfu7"}, {"comment": "You're welcome.

In this part of the country, picking pro-life is the easy path. I chose the other path. Think of me as a lawyer. A lawyer will defend a murderer or a thief. It is his job; it is not that he'll vote for a law for theft to be abolished as a crime. Until the end of this lesson, I'll fulfil the role of defending the position I've taken for this speech. However, you (point to the students or nod as that is less threatening) can pick only one role of two roles. You can take the role of the pro-life lawyer or the judge. If you take the role of the pro-life lawyer, you can't judge me. If you take the role of judge, you can't attack my speech; you value the arguments brought forward. And in either role, you should look at the case, not me. There's one person who is in charge of that, and that's him (point to the teacher; which automatically pays respect to him).\n\nBert\nWhen a woman tries to conceive and she is a few days late and the gets her period, she's a bit disappointed that it didn't work this month but shrugs her shoulder Next month better, perhaps.\nWhen misses her period for two months and has another period, she is s a woman has a miscarriage, she quite disappointed. No candles will be burned in the trash can containing the sanitary pad.\nWhen a woman loses her child at 6 months, she's emotionally shaken. \nWhen a woman loses her child during birth, it will get a burial. \nThere is a gradual increase in emotional attachment. With abortion, the line is drawn, where the woman is not a captive breeding machine but can't change her mind after a certain period that should be long enough to take this hard decision. In any case a person is free to draw the line for herself at conception. \nWhere religion is involved, it should only hold for people who accept that religion as their own.

Then they either had their beliefs confirmed or decided that they need to \"change their ways\" or whatever and then they write a book telling their story in a much more dramatic and extravagant way than it actually happened and sell it to a large demographic which is guaranteed to lap it up like highschoolers at the latest \"chosen teen\" YA movie. \r\rThere's plenty of reasons why NDE's are super unreliable evidence for the existence of the supernatural, and I assume you know a lot of them already. Even if you don't you'll be better prepared if you look them up yourself, rather than having people here explain them to you.

This state has a long history of being the most conservative, evangelical, and extremely poor state in the US. Those three facts are possibly related, but it all stems from not picking ourselves up after the civil war. Mississippi never had much industry before the war, as the entire antebellum economy was dependent on slave labor in plantations. After the war, the plantations stayed, but with extremely \"keep the blacks down\" sharecropping policies. Only recently has industry and gambling tried to develop regions like the coast, Jackson, Golden Triangle area, and the Memphis suburbs. Most of the rest of the state is still heavily depending on agriculture (black belt and delta), or forestry (woody pine forests near Hattiesburg and Laurel). \n\nThere is also a very evident brain-drain from the state, with many of those getting bachelors and higher moving to more major metropolitan areas in the US. As a result, the remaining population continues on the same path of being highly conservative and evangelical. ", "id": "dar4ag8"}, {"comment": "Thank you for reply. You've broadened my mind.

The most likely way to change the state is to stop the brain-drain by focusing on advanced technologies in the STEM fields. I know I sound like the average redditor when I say STEM is a godsend, but businesses of that ilk have the highest potential for growth with industry moving to more automated techniques.\n\nAt least the three major universities in the state (Ole Miss, Miss State, and Southern Miss) engage in these partnership programs that bring technology companies to Oxford/Tupelo, the Golden Triangle, and Hattiesburg, respectively. At least from my knowledge, Mississippi State has a growing entrepreneurship center that is used to invest in new technology companies. The universities also have educational outreach programs that extend to at least their host cities, but better adoption of this form of outreach by the very rural schools has the potential to boost enthusiasm for learning. \n\nThe obesity epidemic is trying to be resolved with the \"Let's go walking, Mississippi\" campaign, and we are no longer in last place in that department (we're 49th!). It could be resolved better with a higher focus on healthcare and an increase in overall income (from more tech companies, right?). \n\nAnother thing I see at fault for keeping the state the way it is is this \"Good ole boys\" mentality. You see it in politicians at the local, state, and federal level, which has led to wide-spread corruption, an example being the old Starkville mayor that would only approve housing projects that were under his company. Fortunately he only served one term, and the city is growing again.\n\nThe main thing you have to remember is that, when ranking any country by subdivisions, someone has to come last.

Aren't social workers more or less doing the work of Jesus in many respects?!\n\nIsn't a big part of the problem that you know a lot more about Christianity than they do? My wife's younger brother attended seminary school for a time much to the delight of his parents. He's an atheist (and a liberal) now as well.\n\nI'd suggest you keep it to yourself, get on with your life and career and show them how to be Christ-like (well... without the miracle working and threatening people to hell etc. ;)\n\nGood luck to you.\n "], [6, "Don't tell them.\n\nAbout 15 years ago I was in prison for a few years.  (Deservedly so.)  I spent a fair amount of time in Buddhist meditation, but really liked one of the protestant chaplains.  All the inmates appreciated how down to earth he was, how non-judgmental he was, and what an all-around good guy he was.  His sermons were always very personal and always led people toward easy changes they could make in their lives to be happier. He really helped the inmates in a great time of need.\n\nI mentioned to him one day how much I appreciated his support of our small Buddhist group.  He replied to me, \"Sometimes I'm Buddhist myself.\"  Needless to say I was confused, and asked for clarification. He explained to me that in his 20 years as a minister he had spent perhaps half of that time not believing in God.  My jaw was on the floor and I asked him how he could preach about Christianity when he didn't believe it himself.\n\nHe said that the first time it happened he was really freaked out and considered leaving the clergy.  But he didn't want to leave his congregation behind; he felt obligated to care for them.  He eventually drifted back into belief, and then back out.  The second time he stopped believing, he realized that it didn't matter in the least whether he believed or not.  The people he ministered to needed a leader, and he was really good at filling that role.  He preached love and forgiveness and salvation and eternity and he gave peace and hope to people who were suffering.  Whether he personally personally believed it at any given time wasn't nearly as important to him as being able to bring people peace in tough times, and give them hope for their futures.\n\nYou don't see eye-to-eye with your parents, but they have given you their best.  There's no need to bring them down.  Tell them about your love of Jesus, for their sake, not for yours.  Tell them of your regular prayers for their health, so that that may feel your love.  And tell them that you will be very sad by their passing but you look forward to reuniting in heaven, so that they may feel peace as they approach the end of their lives.\n\nLive your own life for you, but when you are talking to your parents, frame it in a way that brings them peace and joy.  For example, you can easily explain your career interests: Why social work?  Jesus was very much a Social Worker, helping the downtrodden and those in need.  You see social work as an opportunity to walk in the footsteps of Jesus, spreading his love and compassion.\n\nYou can never \"unsay\" something like \"I am an Atheist.\"  IF you are sure you will be an atheist in a year, tehre's no harm in waiting a year to tell them.

I spent a fair amount of time in Buddhist meditation, but really liked one of the protestant chaplains.  All the inmates appreciated how down to earth he was, how non-judgmental he was, and what an all-around good guy he was.  His sermons were always very personal and always led people toward easy changes they could make in their lives to be happier. He really helped the inmates in a great time of need.\n\nI mentioned to him one day how much I appreciated his support of our small Buddhist group.  He replied to me, \"Sometimes I'm Buddhist myself.\"  Needless to say I was confused, and asked for clarification. He explained to me that in his 20 years as a minister he had spent perhaps half of that time not believing in God.  My jaw was on the floor and I asked him how he could preach about Christianity when he didn't believe it himself.\n\nHe said that the first time it happened he was really freaked out and considered leaving the clergy.  But he didn't want to leave his congregation behind; he felt obligated to care for them.  He eventually drifted back into belief, and then back out.  The second time he stopped believing, he realized that it didn't matter in the least whether he believed or not.  The people he ministered to needed a leader, and he was really good at filling that role.  He preached love and forgiveness and salvation and eternity and he gave peace and hope to people who were suffering.  Whether he personally personally believed it at any given time wasn't nearly as important to him as being able to bring people peace in tough times, and give them hope for their futures.\n\nYou don't see eye-to-eye with your parents, but they have given you their best.  There's no need to bring them down.  Tell them about your love of Jesus, for their sake, not for yours.  Tell them of your regular prayers for their health, so that that may feel your love.  And tell them that you will be very sad by their passing but you look forward to reuniting in heaven, so that they may feel peace as they approach the end of their lives.\n\nLive your own life for you, but when you are talking to your parents, frame it in a way that brings them peace and joy.  For example, you can easily explain your career interests: Why social work?  Jesus was very much a Social Worker, helping the downtrodden and those in need.  You see social work as an opportunity to walk in the footsteps of Jesus, spreading his love and compassion.\n\nYou can never \"unsay\" something like \"I am an Atheist.\"  IF you are sure you will be an atheist in a year, tehre's no harm in waiting a year to tell them.

The Islamic depiction of God is fundamentally irreconcilable with this Christian mythology (Jesus was just a regular human prophet, and Muhammad came afterwards to give the final words of God). According to Islamic mythology, these depictions of God can be rendered consistent (of course, since Islam built itself on Christianity). But from a neutral perspective, we are not entitled to privilege Islamic theology over Christian theology.

And every time they suggest an improvement for women it seems to be \"we should take this from men and give it to women.\"\n\nWhereas an MRA will tend to break things down a bit more as well as cite their sources so that you can fact check what they say, they speak more passively, rarely will they try to convince you, they will simply say \"here are the facts, here is where you can find the facts, if you have any criticism then I'll talk it out with you.\" And whenever they suggest an improvement it is often more about giving men a fighting chance rather than simply taking away what women have worked for. Also, most of the sources where feminist get their information has been pointed out by MRAs.\n\nNot saying that there aren't MRAs ready to make fun of the feminist outright, just like the church of the Flying Spagetti Monster, \"meninist\" tend to parrot exactly what feminist say word-for-word but with the genders swapped to see how people react.\n\nMRAs move with the same swagger you see from atheist, they are very aware that the facts are on their side and have no problem with you digging as deeply as you want, feminist seem to be religious, and tend to have a problem with you digging too deep.

Maybe that seems a little selfish, so think about it this way; what if your mom walked into a bakery and tried to order a cake, and they refused to serve her because they said she was too fat. How would you like that? Is that a world you want to live in? \n\nUltimately, I think one thing we definitely need to recognize about this issue is that it's unavoidably a conflict between two rights. On one side is the right of the business owner to not serve someone who they don't want to serve. On the other is the right for consumers to not be refused service because of who they are. I don't consider either of those rights to be fundamental or inalienable; I absolutely do not accept the assertion that expecting businesses to serve everyone equally is tantamount to slavery. \n\nAnd frankly, I can't think of *any* good, compelling reasons why a business owner should want to deny someone service because of who they are. \"I don't want to make a cake for a gay wedding because my personal religious belief is that homosexuality is wrong.\" Is baking a cake wrong, according to your personal beliefs? Because what you're doing is baking a cake, you're not engaging in homosexual activity. \"We don't serve coloreds here.\" Is there any possible reason for that, except that the business owner is a bigoted asshole? I can't think of any.

Many will share apologetics arguments with me but when I ask them \"are these the things that originally convinced you?\" they reply in the negative.

Often, these experiences only happen when the person is suffering from [magical thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking) or has already trained their brain to expect such experiences, having steeped themselves in the mythology of their particular holy book. People who have spent months reading the Bible, for example, don't tend to have intense visions of Vishnu while experiencing some personal crisis.\n\nThe other annoyance is that proselytizers won't ever share the downsides of believing.

The best parts of life will be what eternal life will be. Regardless, I don't really care what life will be like. Even if there was no life after death, I would believe in God. The promise of eternal life, nor the fear of death, is compelling enough for me to begin believing in any god.

This creates a moving target for the atheist expressing skepticism regarding those beliefs. There are at last count something on the order of three thousand different gods that humans have worshiped; [here's a non-canonical list of them.](http://www.rationalresponders.com/a_big_list_of_gods_but_nowhere_near_all_of_them) In addition, there are thousands of sects within various religions all claiming to worship the same god but attributing different personalities to them effectively creating new gods in the process. Then there are Deist gods who are undefined but nevertheless divine by nature and pantheism which holds that the universe and everything in it is some sort of manifestation of godhood. It's exhausting. So here I will go through a top-level list of gods I don't believe are real.\n\n-----\n\n###1. I don't believe in any gods that are responsible for the creation or function of the universe.\n\nIf you have evidence to demonstrate that your god is the author of all and that nothing can exist without your god then show me the evidence. Your personal conviction is not evidence of anything except that you're convinced. I need more than words to believe, I need [independently verified peer reviewed observation.](http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_scientific_method.shtml#overviewofthescientificmethod) That then brings me to my next point:\n\n-----\n\n###2. I don't believe in any of the gods that must be argued into existence.\n\nPhilosophical arguments from [Thomas Aquinas' Five Ways](http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/aquinas.html) through to the modern [modal ontological argument](http://counterapologist.blogspot.com/2013/02/countering-modal-ontological-argument.html) are not evidence, they're speculation. Speculation only ceases to be speculation when you can present evidence that can be independently reproduced and does not depend on a desire to believe before it can be observed. Claiming that life is dark and ugly without your god doesn't show me your god is real, it shows me you have no imagination. Invoking love and beauty doesn't prove your god is real, it proves you view life through a very narrow lens and I have no reason to limit myself like that. Threatening me with dire consequences doesn't convince me of anything except that you have no argument. Arguing for your god doesn't impress me, evidence does.\n\n-----\n\n###3. I don't believe in any gods that are interested or interceding in our lives.\n\nGods have been depicted as everything from humans or familiar animals with super powers to single [omnimax](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=omnimax) entity greater than the whole of our universe. I could see how people might think the super-powered gods might take an interest in our affairs but the omnimax god doesn't make much sense. It would be like us focusing on a small batch of [mitochondria](http://www.biology4kids.com/files/cell_mito.html) within our bodies and declaring that everything revolves around them. But regardless of power level, I just don't see any reason to believe there are gods intervening in our lives. I get the same results praying to Zeus, Wotan, Jesus and Ganesh as I do to a jug of milk. [Repeated studies find no effective change in outcomes from prayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studies_on_intercessory_prayer) except those corresponding with the [placebo effect](http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-the-placebo-effect) and you can replicate that result just by letting people know you're wishing them well.\n\n-----\n\n###4. I don't believe in any gods that have the power to suspend natural laws to perform miracles.\n\nMiracles are tricky things. They never happen when anyone can test or verify them. A discouraging number of them have been debunked, even the \"official\" ones. They're always held up by the faithful as evidence of their gods' power but they're rarely convincing to anyone else. I rarely hear of devout Hindus experiencing a miracle from the Christian god or devout Christians experiencing miracles performed by the Muslim god. But let's assume for the sake of argument that these miracles really did happen as claimed; where's the evidence? Even an ethereal, extra-temporal omnimax god would necessarily leave traces when interacting with our universe, also known as \"evidence.\" The evidence presented for these miracles is always subjective and typically anecdotal. There's never any evidence that skeptical researchers can point to and say \"that must be of supernatural origin, because it violates causality.\"\n\n-----\n\n###5. I don't believe in any of the gods that have been presented to me because I've not been given convincing evidence that any of them exist.\n\nI've said it before and I'll continue to say it as long as it continues to be applicable: I'll believe anything you tell me as long as you show me evidence appropriate to the claim. Nothing else will do, and you're only wasting your time if you think you've come up with a new argument or example for why I should believe. If your evidence wouldn't win you [the Randi Foundation Million Dollar Prize](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Dollar_Paranormal_Challenge) then it won't move me, either.\n\n^[^Permalink.](http://spaceghoti.blogspot.com/2015/01/all-gods-i-dont-believe-in.html)", "id": "danspcl"}, {"comment": "It seems like you're not interested in speculating about anything outside what is empirically observable, and I can respect that.", "id": "dant9x6"}, {"comment": "Given how many people espouse contradictory claims based on whatever speculation they find convincing, I think I'm justified in questioning the ability of philosophy to separate fantasy from reality.

This is a huge problem, and partially why I asked this question here. I want to help open up the conversation, bring people together to be able to discuss their beliefs, not just in a polite way, but in an intellectually honest way that elevates both sides of the conversation.\n\nAnyway, the all-knowing Google has the following article as the first result for \"intellectual honesty.\" Let's see if I can be intellectually honest using a Christian framework.\n\n> 1 Do not overstate the power of your argument. One\u2019s sense of conviction should be in proportion to the level of clear evidence assessable by most. If someone portrays their opponents as being either stupid or dishonest for disagreeing, intellectual dishonesty is probably in play. Intellectual honesty is most often associated with humility, not arrogance.\n\nI don't think I've done any of these things here, although I may be guilty of having committed the sin of overstating my arguments in the past.\n\n> 2 Show a willingness to publicly acknowledge that reasonable alternative viewpoints exist. The alternative views do not have to be treated as equally valid or powerful, but rarely is it the case that one and only one viewpoint has a complete monopoly on reason and evidence.\n\nI think I've done this here.\n\n> 3 Be willing to publicly acknowledge and question one\u2019s own assumptions and biases. All of us rely on assumptions when applying our world view to make sense of the data about the world. And all of us bring various biases to the table.\n\nAgain, I believe I am doing this.\n\n> 4 Be willing to publicly acknowledge where your argument is weak. Almost all arguments have weak spots, but those who are trying to sell an ideology will have great difficulty with this point and would rather obscure or downplay any weak points.\n\nI fully admit that it takes a huge leap of faith to believe in God or Christianity, which is a very weak spot in my worldview.\n\n> 5 Be willing to publicly acknowledge when you are wrong. Those selling an ideology likewise have great difficulty admitting to being wrong, as this undercuts the rhetoric and image that is being sold. You get small points for admitting to being wrong on trivial matters and big points for admitting to being wrong on substantive points. You lose big points for failing to admit being wrong on something trivial.\n\nI may not do this very well in person when emotions are involved, but I tend to admit when I'm wrong (eventually).\n\n> 6 Demonstrate consistency. A clear sign of intellectual dishonesty is when someone extensively relies on double standards. Typically, an excessively high standard is applied to the perceived opponent(s), while a very low standard is applied to the ideologues\u2019 allies.\n\nI don't think I'm trying to have my cake and eat it too, and I will listen to anyone who will try to tell me otherwise. I really value being intellectually consistent.\n\n> 7 Address the argument instead of attacking the person making the argument. Ad hominem arguments are a clear sign of intellectual dishonesty. However, often times, the dishonesty is more subtle. For example, someone might make a token effort at debunking an argument and then turn significant attention to the person making the argument, relying on stereotypes, guilt-by-association, and innocent-sounding gotcha questions.\n\nI regularly call out others for making ad hominem attacks against Trump, atheists, and other people I disagree with. If someone has a good argument, it's a good argument. End of story.\n\n> 8 When addressing an argument, do not misrepresent it. A common tactic of the intellectually dishonest is to portray their opponent\u2019s argument in straw man terms. In politics, this is called spin. Typically, such tactics eschew quoting the person in context, but instead rely heavily on out-of-context quotes, paraphrasing and impression. When addressing an argument, one should shows signs of having made a serious effort to first understand the argument and then accurately represent it in its strongest form.\n\nI have no interest in creating straw men out of my opponents and I can't stand it when people do it to me.\n\n> 9 Show a commitment to critical thinking.\n\nIt is extremely uncomfortable to be a Christian who thinks critically about the plethora of good arguments against a belief in God, and yet I subject myself to that discomfort for the sake of being honest. I don't want to believe in a god if that god only exists in a bubble.\n\n> 10 Be willing to publicly acknowledge when a point or criticism is good. If someone is unable or unwilling to admit when their opponent raises a good point or makes a good criticism, it demonstrates an unwillingness to participate in the give-and-take that characterizes an honest exchange.\n\nI think I do that, and have done that. I did it at the top of this comment.\n\nEdit: formatting", "id": "danww91"}, {"comment": "> I fully admit that it takes a huge leap of faith to believe in God or Christianity, which is a very weak spot in my worldview.\n\nTHIS THREAD IS NOW OVER.\n\nWe can pack up and go home guys.", "id": "dao6h5p"}, {"comment": "> We can pack up and go home guys.\n\nYou are literally the only atheist to come here and antagonize me, so I don't know who you're referring to.

Omnimax deities are one common example.\n\nFor the previous two, I attempt to draw out missing or flawed details and get the other person to say what they mean more precisely.  Those end up dealing with abstractions, word games ('god is love' ... 'god is more than just love' ... 'no, god is the embodiment of love' ... and around and around), and too often a set of unfounded assertions or even contradictory claims that the person is unable or unwilling to acknowledge.

Yet, for the ones that these discussions cover these two points are good bookends.)\n\nBecause of that, even though I don't have a narrow description for what gods are -- and neither do most theists -- the conclusion must be that if any gods exist those gods must want there to be disagreements.  If this is not a reasonable conclusion, then the gods must be less than exceedingly aware or powerful.\n\n------\n\nRelated;\n\n* [***God exists!*** -- Tracie Harris covers most of what I think on the topic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaUtzhdlFto)", "id": "daoi1t9"}, {"comment": "I've heard so much about Mere Christianity.

The specifics are very, very different, but the general idea still applies.", "id": "daqbpnq"}], [{"comment": "Facing up to mortality is one of the challenges we face from living in the real universe. The loss of friends and the prospect of our own death isn't something we cope with easily. I can't suggest a fix but if it didn't hurt you would be less of a person.", "id": "daqf0ol"}], [{"comment": "Get a new pupper. Have a nice couple of days with your old pupper before he goes. When he goes, then it's over, be sad, but get another pup and start over. Of course you'll be sad, there isnt a heaven for dogs even in Christianity, so Your Atheism shouldn't matter overly. I'm really sorry to hear that, one of our dogs is getting old and won't last longer than a couple of years, I'll be sad when he goes and I'll minimise that sadness with a nice home for a new dog.", "id": "daqfjuw"}], [{"comment": "Just lost a cat a couple weeks ago so I can empathize with you. But knowing your dog is going to be put down before it happens, that's rough. Almost cruel. No that is cruel.\n\nI always take comfort in the fact that dogs (all pets really) don't dwell on the past or have regrets like humans. Spend what time you can with your dog, even if its just hugging and crying. Shit now I'm crying.\n\nBeing an atheist doesn't have the delusion of (blank) is still alive somewhere, and it does suck. But it also means you get a chance to say goodbye. I don't think hardcore theists are truly capable of dealing with goodbyes like that. Maybe you can take some strength from that.\n\nMe? I'm a woodworker and said my goodbyes by making a nice casket. I was lucky considering my neighbor found my cat and took care of her before I got home.", "id": "daqjm8s"}], [{"comment": "In this life, which is finite, we can experience happiness in the way that is most rewarding to us. For some, that's being a pastor. For others, they become family pediatric doctors. For some, it's playing videogames on Twitch and ranting about spacing for your dumbass team by chucking a grenade into their squad in ARMA. But everyone experiences their own special version of happiness. Dogs, by their artificial section by humans, were bred to be companions, guards and the like by early humans, so they experience their happiness by making you happy. If your dog made you happy when he was here, that's part of the way you experience happiness on this finite world in your finite life, and even though you will never see that particular dog again, the ripples of past love that the dog gave you through their life will echo across the rest of your life and every cuddle you give your next dog will echo the love you want to still give your lost dog. The next dog or pet you get will feel that extra happiness and so will you.\n\nThat's much more rewarding than believing that you will see your pet again in heaven TBH because it makes your time with your pets and loved ones much more special because you can't experience it again.\n\nI miss you Molly and Sam. You were my first dogs and every time I pet another dog, I think about you and that's the best gift you could have given me.", "id": "daqowvf"}], [{"comment": "Many religions don't believe that dogs have souls or that dogs go to heaven. So you can handle your dog's death just the same way those religious people do.\n\nIt's okay to feel sad when sad things happen. It's okay if religious rituals make you feel better even if you don't believe the religious details. Maybe spend quiet time thinking about your dog? Maybe go to a place that you and your dog spent time together (a park?) and thank your dog for being a good companion and wish her well, and promise that you'll keep her memory close.", "id": "daqtkr0"}], [{"comment": "I cried the day my cat died.  I sometimes miss him.  Though at the end of the day I buck up and accept it didn't really matter as none of this really does.  We are here and then we are gone.
