Well, if you expected to move in on day 1 without telling her you were coming, that's creepy. But nowhere near as creepy as what she did.\n\nSomething like that happens to all of us. Between marriages I dated a lot and decided to never say no to a date. Once I flew 4500 km (2800 miles) from Canada to L.A. for a date and it turned out to be a weird date. (To be fair, I didn't go just for the date but used it as an excuse to take a rock climbing vacation to Joshua Tree National Park, and didn't expect much from the date. But she was in Maxim magazine so I figured why not go.)\n\nAnother date was 1600 km (1000 miles) away in Myrtle Beach, SC. I was driving to Orlando anyway so planned an extra day for the beach. She was nothing like her photos (by a good 60 pounds) but at least she was single and took me to a great strip club. It was actually mostly fun.\n\nI was also Catfished once. It was 200 km (120 miles) away and over months she reeled me in nicely. A total cat-and-mouse game as if straight from The Rules. I was hooked and *had* to meet her. Got stood up the first time. (No answer at her door.) I called her out on being a flake, but after a month and many apologies she reeled me in again. This time she was there. It was her from the photos (I had checked by getting her to write stuff in photos), but she had clearly gone through massive effort to look younger, thinner, and prettier in the photos with makeup, lighting, and angles. I had lost all attraction. But I stayed and we played video games; until she made the moves on me, and then her husband got home, and then I saw pictures of her kids in the house. A month later she called pretending to be somebody else (while my new gf was over) but I called her out on it.\n\nSome people just have fantasy lives online I guess, and when the other person thinks it's real and shows up IRL, it can be a problem. For me, these aren't disasters but are some of my best dating stories and I look back on them fondly. Not as good outcomes, but I took chances, had some life experiences where nobody got hurt (assuming the woman's husband didn't leave her), and have some great stories I've told many times in the decade since. \n\nTaking those same chances is what led me to finding my dream girl, and we've been married almost 8 years now with 2 great kids.\n\nI say good for you. You took a big chance on a great opportunity and it bombed. You're out the travel costs, but you got a road trip out of it, life experience, and a great story you'll tell for the rest of your life. You'll get a job and find a great girlfriend, and hopefully your dream girl will come along. Keep taking those chances.

She totally led you on and talked about you moving in. That you took her up on it, and tried to be romantic and surprise her isn't creepy. Well, if you expected to move in on day 1 without telling her you were coming, that's creepy. But nowhere near as creepy as what she did.\n\nSomething like that happens to all of us. Between marriages I dated a lot and decided to never say no to a date. Once I flew 4500 km (2800 miles) from Canada to L.A. for a date and it turned out to be a weird date. (To be fair, I didn't go just for the date but used it as an excuse to take a rock climbing vacation to Joshua Tree National Park, and didn't expect much from the date. But she was in Maxim magazine so I figured why not go.)\n\nAnother date was 1600 km (1000 miles) away in Myrtle Beach, SC. I was driving to Orlando anyway so planned an extra day for the beach. She was nothing like her photos (by a good 60 pounds) but at least she was single and took me to a great strip club. It was actually mostly fun.\n\nI was also Catfished once. It was 200 km (120 miles) away and over months she reeled me in nicely. A total cat-and-mouse game as if straight from The Rules. I was hooked and *had* to meet her. Got stood up the first time. (No answer at her door.) I called her out on being a flake, but after a month and many apologies she reeled me in again. This time she was there. It was her from the photos (I had checked by getting her to write stuff in photos), but she had clearly gone through massive effort to look younger, thinner, and prettier in the photos with makeup, lighting, and angles. I had lost all attraction. But I stayed and we played video games; until she made the moves on me, and then her husband got home, and then I saw pictures of her kids in the house. A month later she called pretending to be somebody else (while my new gf was over) but I called her out on it.\n\nSome people just have fantasy lives online I guess, and when the other person thinks it's real and shows up IRL, it can be a problem. For me, these aren't disasters but are some of my best dating stories and I look back on them fondly. Not as good outcomes, but I took chances, had some life experiences where nobody got hurt (assuming the woman's husband didn't leave her), and have some great stories I've told many times in the decade since. \n\nTaking those same chances is what led me to finding my dream girl, and we've been married almost 8 years now with 2 great kids.\n\nI say good for you. You took a big chance on a great opportunity and it bombed. You're out the travel costs, but you got a road trip out of it, life experience, and a great story you'll tell for the rest of your life. You'll get a job and find a great girlfriend, and hopefully your dream girl will come along. Keep taking those chances.

Possibly the best review ever:- \n\nByJohn W .on 30 July 2012\n\nAfter having been told my danglies looked like an elderly rastafarian I decided to take the plunge and buy some of this as previous shaving attempts had only been mildly successful and I nearly put my back out trying to reach the more difficult bits.\n\nBeing a bit of a romantic I thought I would do the deed on the missus's birthday as a bit of a treat.I ordered it well in advance and working in the North sea I considered myself a bit above some of the characters writing the previous reviews and wrote them off as soft office types...oh my fellow sufferers how wrong I was.\n\nI waited until the other half was tucked up in bed and after giving some vague hints about a special surprise I went down to the bathroom. Initially all went well and I applied the gel and stood waiting for something to happen. I didn't have long to wait.\n\nAt first there was a gentle warmth which in a matter of seconds was replaced by an intense burning and a feeling I can only describe as like being given a barbed wire wedgie by two people intent on hitting the ceiling with my head.\n\nReligion hadn't featured much in my life until that night but I suddenly became willing to convert to any religion to stop the violent burning around the turd tunnel and what seemed like the destruction of the meat and two veg.\n\nStruggling to not bite through my bottom lip I tried to wash the gel of in the sink and only succeeded in blocking the plughole with a mat of hair.Through the haze of tears I struggled out of the bathroom across the hall into the kitchen by this time walking was not really possible and I crawled the final yard to the fridge in the hope of some form of cold relief.\n\nI yanked the freezer drawer out and found a tub of ice cream, tore the lid of and positioned it under me. The relief was fantastic but only temporary as it melted fairly quickly and the fiery stabbing soon returned.\n\nDue to the shape of the ice cream tub I hadn't managed to give the starfish any treatment and I groped around in the draw for something else as I was sure my vision was going to fail fairly soon. I grabbed a bag of what I later found out was frozen sprouts and tore it open trying to be quiet as I did so. I took a handful of them and tried in vain to clench some between the cheeks of my arse.\n\nThis was not doing the trick as some of the gel had found it's way up the chutney channel and it felt like the space shuttle was running it's engines behind me.This was probably and hopefully the only time in my life I was going to wish there was a gay snowman in the kitchen which should give you some idea of the depths I was willing to sink to in order to ease the pain.\n\nThe only solution my pain crazed mind could come up with was to gently ease one of the sprouts where no veg had gone before.\n\nUnfortunately, alerted by the strange grunts coming from the kitchen the other half chose that moment to come and investigate and was greeted by the sight of me, arse in the air, strawberry ice cream dripping from my bell end pushing a sprout up my arse while muttering...\" Ooooh that feels good \"\n\nUnderstandingly this was a shock to her and she let out a scream and as I hadn't heard her come in it caused an involuntary spasm of shock in myself which resulted in the sprout being ejected at quite some speed in her direction.\n\nI can understand that having a sprout farted against your leg at 11 at night in the kitchen probably wasn't the special surprise she was expecting and having to explain to the kids the next day what the strange hollow in the ice cream was didn't improve my status...\n\nSo to sum it up Veet removes hair, dignity and self respect....... :-\n\n"], [23, "Nair.

Possibly the best review ever:- \n\nByJohn W .on 30 July 2012\n\nAfter having been told my danglies looked like an elderly rastafarian I decided to take the plunge and buy some of this as previous shaving attempts had only been mildly successful and I nearly put my back out trying to reach the more difficult bits.\n\nBeing a bit of a romantic I thought I would do the deed on the missus's birthday as a bit of a treat.I ordered it well in advance and working in the North sea I considered myself a bit above some of the characters writing the previous reviews and wrote them off as soft office types...oh my fellow sufferers how wrong I was.\n\nI waited until the other half was tucked up in bed and after giving some vague hints about a special surprise I went down to the bathroom. Initially all went well and I applied the gel and stood waiting for something to happen. I didn't have long to wait.\n\nAt first there was a gentle warmth which in a matter of seconds was replaced by an intense burning and a feeling I can only describe as like being given a barbed wire wedgie by two people intent on hitting the ceiling with my head.\n\nReligion hadn't featured much in my life until that night but I suddenly became willing to convert to any religion to stop the violent burning around the turd tunnel and what seemed like the destruction of the meat and two veg.\n\nStruggling to not bite through my bottom lip I tried to wash the gel of in the sink and only succeeded in blocking the plughole with a mat of hair.Through the haze of tears I struggled out of the bathroom across the hall into the kitchen by this time walking was not really possible and I crawled the final yard to the fridge in the hope of some form of cold relief.\n\nI yanked the freezer drawer out and found a tub of ice cream, tore the lid of and positioned it under me. The relief was fantastic but only temporary as it melted fairly quickly and the fiery stabbing soon returned.\n\nDue to the shape of the ice cream tub I hadn't managed to give the starfish any treatment and I groped around in the draw for something else as I was sure my vision was going to fail fairly soon. I grabbed a bag of what I later found out was frozen sprouts and tore it open trying to be quiet as I did so. I took a handful of them and tried in vain to clench some between the cheeks of my arse.\n\nThis was not doing the trick as some of the gel had found it's way up the chutney channel and it felt like the space shuttle was running it's engines behind me.This was probably and hopefully the only time in my life I was going to wish there was a gay snowman in the kitchen which should give you some idea of the depths I was willing to sink to in order to ease the pain.\n\nThe only solution my pain crazed mind could come up with was to gently ease one of the sprouts where no veg had gone before.\n\nUnfortunately, alerted by the strange grunts coming from the kitchen the other half chose that moment to come and investigate and was greeted by the sight of me, arse in the air, strawberry ice cream dripping from my bell end pushing a sprout up my arse while muttering...\" Ooooh that feels good \"\n\nUnderstandingly this was a shock to her and she let out a scream and as I hadn't heard her come in it caused an involuntary spasm of shock in myself which resulted in the sprout being ejected at quite some speed in her direction.\n\nI can understand that having a sprout farted against your leg at 11 at night in the kitchen probably wasn't the special surprise she was expecting and having to explain to the kids the next day what the strange hollow in the ice cream was didn't improve my status...\n\nSo to sum it up Veet removes hair, dignity and self respect....... :-\n\n", "id": "dar7iac"}], [{"comment": "Nair.

One summer afternoon, we had a couple friends over and were out in the field playing with one of those giant 3-person water ballon slingshots, seeing how far we could launch balloons while my parents were off at work...\n\nDue to the placement of the buildings and various trees, the only direction we could really shoot was towards the highway, but we were always short by 20-30' fairly consistently, no matter how hard we tried, and there was hardly any traffic regardless.  You can probably see where this is going...\n\nSo we decide to really lean into one shot, bracing against rocks, posts, whatever and strain the slingshot bands to their absolute limit... no cars coming, so we launch... and a half second after the water balloon takes off, a car came around the corner of the highway.  I swear, you could watch the two converge perfectly in what seemed like slow motion - water balloon right to the middle of the guys windshield.\n\nCar locked up it's brakes and skidded to a stop right by a cluster of trees by the road, and a guy jumped out with something in his hand that I think was a gun, and started screaming \"I'm gonna fucking kill you!\"  \n\nAt this point we freak out and run into the house and hide... when I snuck a peek back outside, the guy was kicking around the brush and trees by the road, yelling and swearing. I'm guessing he thought we had hidden down there and thrown the balloon and didn't see us back by the house ~100yds away... anyway, after several minutes of kicking around and screaming threats, he finally got back in his car and drove off... never did shoot water balloons toward the road again, and never really talked about it after that."], [93, "I hope you didn't use the horses' real names."], [68, "Too bad they didn't catch you.

He slams on his brakes and backs up, despite the heavy traffic. \"Should we haul ass?\" Bob asked, and I replied \"No, it was an accident, we'll just explain that to him.\" The guy comes charging over and is just steaming mad, and grabs Bob in a headlock and starts trying to drag him to his car. I freaked out and ran to the hospital where my mom worked, which luckily was maybe 75 yards away. \"There's a guy trying to kidnap Bob!\" I blurted out when I saw her inside, and either she or her male co-worker called the police and we ran outside to rescue him. That's when we saw the guy and Bob just standing there, not scuffling, and I felt like a dumb shit. IIRC the cops showed up and the guy angrily told them his side of the story and I insisted we didn't do it on purpose. He made some \"juvenile delinquent\" comments and I was thinking \"You were the one who was grabbing a 12 year old old and trying to force him into your car you piece of shit!\" Fortunately I said this with my inside voice.

One passing car did not like this, as they pulled a u-turn, pulled another u-turn and as they drove past me the passenger chucked a big-gulp at me. He missed, and I may or may not have wet myself a little.\n\n2) In my high school days my friends thought it would be a good idea to chuck some water balloons at some passing cars from the woods along a busy street at night in the dark. I must have had perfect aim because my balloon landed on a car's windshield with a perfect crack. This probably scared the crap out of the driver and given what little remains of a balloon after impact they might have thought they got shot at.

Then we would put it in the middle of the road, usually right after the crest of a hill. We would be hiding in the nearby cornfield with the other end of the rope in hand. A car would drive by, run over the grain shovel, then we would quickly pull the shovel off the road and into the tall grass in the ditch. The car would stop, get out, try to find out what the hell made the godawful racket, see nothing, and then drive off scratching his head, confused. This worked pretty well until someone ran over the shovel and the rope became detached from the shovel. There was no way in hell we were gonna give up our defensive position and expose ourselves to the enemy, so we waited to see what he would do. He stopped the car, backed up to where the shovel was lying in the road, picked it up and held it over his head in truimph, and yelled into the cornfield, \"I got your shovel, you little fuckers!\", and then drove off.

Both of us had pretty good arms and so would go to the  back lot and throw snowballs at cars, we got pretty good at it - probably hitting 25% of the cars that went by.

One summer afternoon, we had a couple friends over and were out in the field playing with one of those giant 3-person water ballon slingshots, seeing how far we could launch balloons while my parents were off at work...\n\nDue to the placement of the buildings and various trees, the only direction we could really shoot was towards the highway, but we were always short by 20-30' fairly consistently, no matter how hard we tried, and there was hardly any traffic regardless.  You can probably see where this is going...\n\nSo we decide to really lean into one shot, bracing against rocks, posts, whatever and strain the slingshot bands to their absolute limit... no cars coming, so we launch... and a half second after the water balloon takes off, a car came around the corner of the highway.  I swear, you could watch the two converge perfectly in what seemed like slow motion - water balloon right to the middle of the guys windshield.\n\nCar locked up it's brakes and skidded to a stop right by a cluster of trees by the road, and a guy jumped out with something in his hand that I think was a gun, and started screaming \"I'm gonna fucking kill you!\"  \n\nAt this point we freak out and run into the house and hide... when I snuck a peek back outside, the guy was kicking around the brush and trees by the road, yelling and swearing. I'm guessing he thought we had hidden down there and thrown the balloon and didn't see us back by the house ~100yds away... anyway, after several minutes of kicking around and screaming threats, he finally got back in his car and drove off... never did shoot water balloons toward the road again, and never really talked about it after that.", "id": "dam03wd"}, {"comment": "Something relatively similar happened to me in college.

I was along for the ride so to speak but not operating the water balloon launcher. After our RA banned them from shooting oranges inside the dorm hallway (which was horribly dangerous but also very satisfying to watch) they turned their attention to the girl's dorm. We knew a few girls on the exact same floor as us, just 100-ish yards away in the opposite dorm and they decided to see if they could hit their window through our own dorms window with a water balloon. It was all fun and games until they actually hit the window. Who knew a standard water balloon could shatter a double-paned window at close to freezing temperatures? Long story short they hid the water balloon launcher in ceiling tiles and everyone hid out in my room (we had been in the next door neighbors room).

We didn't have much and managed to get all of our things moved in on Sunday night. The utilities were scheduled to get turned on Monday and I planned to leave work early to make sure that everything was done. As I pull into the neighborhood I see a firetruck and lots of people standing around this house that caught fire. I told myself that it sucks to be them, that is until I notice our Landcruiser parked in the driveway. This was my first time seeing the house in the day time. Turns out that one of the eyes on the stove was in the on position. When they turned the power on, the box sitting on the stove caught fire, setting a good part of the kitchen ablaze. I can only speak for myself, but I have never checked to see if the stove was turned off or if the handles on the sinks/bathtub was in the off position, but I do now. So that pretty much sucked because we didn't have renters insurance, at least 60% of our belongings were smoke damaged, and we had no place to live. But here's our silver lining. The power company was to come out and to set up an exterior power junction so that they could proceed to start construction on the house. Well, the technician came and put the meter on the house. What that means is that the house was live. The only thing preventing it from burning down completely was the breakers were turned off. We took pictures and documented everything.

I too was burglarized and I have renters insurance. *After* the 500 dollar deductible comes an extremely complicated method of determining the value of the property taken. Replacement cost? Hardly. After listing your losses the insurance company sends your list to a third party vendor who determines *suitable* replacement devices. You had a 50 inch Samsung LCD TV? Walmart has a 50 inch Dipthouie LCD for $249 this week. But wait. The insurance company is concerned about inflated claims, so they will only pay you 75% of the value of *the Dipthouie;* the rest will come once you prove you actually purchased the piece of shit.\n\nThen comes the frantic need to settle the claim quickly. It appears that the insurance company is genuinely concerned and wants to attend your needs promptly. In truth they want to settle before you can even figure out all the stuff that is missing. That (expensive) food processor stuck in the closet that you only pull out once or twice a year? Too bad you forgot to list it until your claim is finalized but too it probably doesn't matter since there is a clause stipulating how often you have *recently* used it anyway. So long story short, my 20V Dewalt tools could be replaced by Black and Decker, my $8000 communications testset hadn't been used in the last year so doesn't constitute a loss and it is just too bad that I didn't thoroughly discover all my losses when they rushed me to sign forms.\n\nTLDR: Read your policy carefully; all 45 pages.

It's best to sign up for it after you sign your lease. Here's my reason why:\n\nBack in 2007 my ex-wife and I signed the papers to rent a new home from a couple that she knew. We didn't have much and managed to get all of our things moved in on Sunday night. The utilities were scheduled to get turned on Monday and I planned to leave work early to make sure that everything was done. As I pull into the neighborhood I see a firetruck and lots of people standing around this house that caught fire. I told myself that it sucks to be them, that is until I notice our Landcruiser parked in the driveway. This was my first time seeing the house in the day time. Turns out that one of the eyes on the stove was in the on position. When they turned the power on, the box sitting on the stove caught fire, setting a good part of the kitchen ablaze. I can only speak for myself, but I have never checked to see if the stove was turned off or if the handles on the sinks/bathtub was in the off position, but I do now. So that pretty much sucked because we didn't have renters insurance, at least 60% of our belongings were smoke damaged, and we had no place to live. But here's our silver lining. The power company was to come out and to set up an exterior power junction so that they could proceed to start construction on the house. Well, the technician came and put the meter on the house. What that means is that the house was live. The only thing preventing it from burning down completely was the breakers were turned off. We took pictures and documented everything. The power company accepted responsibility for the damages and we settled for $25,000.

I too was burglarized and I have renters insurance. *After* the 500 dollar deductible comes an extremely complicated method of determining the value of the property taken. Replacement cost? Hardly. After listing your losses the insurance company sends your list to a third party vendor who determines *suitable* replacement devices. You had a 50 inch Samsung LCD TV? Walmart has a 50 inch Dipthouie LCD for $249 this week. But wait. The insurance company is concerned about inflated claims, so they will only pay you 75% of the value of *the Dipthouie;* the rest will come once you prove you actually purchased the piece of shit.\n\nThen comes the frantic need to settle the claim quickly. It appears that the insurance company is genuinely concerned and wants to attend your needs promptly. In truth they want to settle before you can even figure out all the stuff that is missing. That (expensive) food processor stuck in the closet that you only pull out once or twice a year? Too bad you forgot to list it until your claim is finalized but too it probably doesn't matter since there is a clause stipulating how often you have *recently* used it anyway. So long story short, my 20V Dewalt tools could be replaced by Black and Decker, my $8000 communications testset hadn't been used in the last year so doesn't constitute a loss and it is just too bad that I didn't thoroughly discover all my losses when they rushed me to sign forms.\n\nTLDR: Read your policy carefully; all 45 pages.

That is good enough for me.  You are young. You found yourself in a situation for which you were not prepared.  You might as well have tossed a coin in order to come to a decision.\n\nHaving said that, I think your school of higher learning failed you on this.  This sort of thing really should have been discussed at some point.  There is some logic to the idea that a kid who is struggling with 'the question' would come to an authority figure of all that is truthful.\n\nOF COURSE THE KID CAME TO YOU!\n\nAs a parent, here is what I ask you to do with my kid.  Bend over, get on there level.  Look them in the eyes.  Smile and ask, 'What do your parents believe?'.\n\nWork the kiddo from that angle.\n\n*\"That is fine Mr. Baggins.  But I have a group of kids gathered around me demanding an answer.\"*\n\nRun - Like - Hell.  McDonalds is always hiring.\n\nThe thing about Santa, from my (a Father's) perspective, it is a ton of fun, it is completely harmless and it strongly plays to a child's strong imagination.\n\nI think these adults that think children are small adults and to never lie to anyone - including a child - need to get a grip and leave my daughters and my family alone to our fun.\n\nThe problem that you as a teacher has is that there is no acceptable age to breaking the bad news to your kid.  So sitting there in your class, every Christmas, is a potential time bomb waiting to go off.

(Not the keyhole, but the hole that one side of the cuff slides into to lock.)

Not pink and fluffy, just normal metal. Although cheap and poor quality.\n\nUnlike OP I decided to try them out before use. I locked them, unlocked them, no problem. So I snapped one on my wrist, locked it, unlocked it, no problem. Then I tried it again. Snap. Clicked it down quite tightly on my wrist. A bit uncomfortable for me, but I guess it's what I was after. Went to take it off. Nope.\n\nI'm bamboozled and also flummoxed at the same time. I'd already tested these things a few times but now, all of a sudden with them slightly too tight against my wrist, they won't open. I try the key again and again but it just spins loosely in the lock, not engaging with anything and the cuff won't budge.\n\nSo I start to panic a little. I think about where I can go for help. Back to the shop ? Would they know what to do ? Why would they, they just sell the things. A locksmith ? The cops ? Thieve's guild ?Hospital ? How do I explain myself without looking like the world's biggest idiot ?\n\nI'm looking at the damned things in disbelief. They were working before and NOW they latch on to me for life ? I don't know how I noticed, but something looked off about them now. Looking closer, they didn't look to be sitting cleanly on one of the ratchet spaces (I don't know what you call them).\n\nSo here was a possible plan. There was no going backwards and loosening them, I'd tried that already. But I could tighten them just a little more and see if that would click them into position. However, they were already on my wrist really tightly. I was worried they would start cutting off circulation and then I'd really have to get help, and fast. A decision then, the safe and sensible thing is to bite the bullet and go get help. Or I can risk making things worse by clicking it even tighter on my wrist, possibly injuring myself but if it works then no one knows I'm an idiot.\n\nWith a sick feeling in my stomach I squeezed the handcuff tighter and heard it click. Put the key in the lock and suddenly it worked, unlocking the cuff from my wrist. Turns out I had it balanced just on the edge of one of the ratchets so it couldn't go back, my fat wrist was stopping it from going forward, and the position was making the key just spin loosely in the lock. But at least I got out of them and at least I was alone so no one could laugh at my stupidity.

A new door frame is _much_ cheaper than your legal defense bills and just lost time if you have to answer questioning.  Even if it's an open and shut case of self defense, you still are probably going to need to retain a lawyer.  It's a murder charge if the police make the wrong conclusion.  And a busted door frame helps them make the right conclusion...\n\nHow can the police distinguish the 2 possibilities of : (a) you invited someone in so you could murder them and (b) they came in uninvited with malicious intent, and not just a case of wrong door?  (no, gunning down someone who opens the wrong apartment door by mistake is not self defense and you'd go to prison for manslaughter if that's what it looks like to the court)?\n\nIf the doorframe is busted, it is pretty darn good evidence in your favor.  To show murder/manslaughter they need a _lot_ more and will probably leave you alone.\n\nAlso, if you did piss someone off and your door is unlocked and they already have their gun drawn with the safety off, they can just open your door and pop you.  Unless you're a world class quickdraw champion they are going to get the first few shots.  With the door locked they need time to break it down.

Not pink and fluffy, just normal metal. Although cheap and poor quality.\n\nUnlike OP I decided to try them out before use. I locked them, unlocked them, no problem. So I snapped one on my wrist, locked it, unlocked it, no problem. Then I tried it again. Snap. Clicked it down quite tightly on my wrist. A bit uncomfortable for me, but I guess it's what I was after. Went to take it off. Nope.\n\nI'm bamboozled and also flummoxed at the same time. I'd already tested these things a few times but now, all of a sudden with them slightly too tight against my wrist, they won't open. I try the key again and again but it just spins loosely in the lock, not engaging with anything and the cuff won't budge.\n\nSo I start to panic a little. I think about where I can go for help. Back to the shop ? Would they know what to do ? Why would they, they just sell the things. A locksmith ? The cops ? Thieve's guild ?Hospital ? How do I explain myself without looking like the world's biggest idiot ?\n\nI'm looking at the damned things in disbelief. They were working before and NOW they latch on to me for life ? I don't know how I noticed, but something looked off about them now. Looking closer, they didn't look to be sitting cleanly on one of the ratchet spaces (I don't know what you call them).\n\nSo here was a possible plan. There was no going backwards and loosening them, I'd tried that already. But I could tighten them just a little more and see if that would click them into position. However, they were already on my wrist really tightly. I was worried they would start cutting off circulation and then I'd really have to get help, and fast. A decision then, the safe and sensible thing is to bite the bullet and go get help. Or I can risk making things worse by clicking it even tighter on my wrist, possibly injuring myself but if it works then no one knows I'm an idiot.\n\nWith a sick feeling in my stomach I squeezed the handcuff tighter and heard it click. Put the key in the lock and suddenly it worked, unlocking the cuff from my wrist. Turns out I had it balanced just on the edge of one of the ratchets so it couldn't go back, my fat wrist was stopping it from going forward, and the position was making the key just spin loosely in the lock. But at least I got out of them and at least I was alone so no one could laugh at my stupidity.

This has nothing to do with school discipline.\n\nIt seems to me that, while you do share some blame in this, as a lot of it was your idea, the 7th grader does too, as well as your friend for going along with it (is your friend incapable of making their own decisions? If so, they don't have much of a future anyway). And I think the severity of the discipline is entirely on his mother.\n\nThere is a fine line between a parent who happens to be their child's teacher, coach, or principle not showing favoritism and applying the rules differently in the other direction towards their child. Both are wrong. She should ask herself if she would have had the same reaction with any other pupil. If not, she is in the wrong.\n\nCell phones were the size of a brick when I was in High School and no kid had one (though a few had a pager), so I don't fully understand how they are regulated in school now, but I just can't see this as a suspend-able offense. I liken it to leaving a prank letter/note in someone's locker. Nobody ever got suspended for that in my day that I was ever aware of. Detention at best.\n\nTo put your mind at ease a bit, or at least your friend's, things like \"Beta Club\" and NHS are pretty meaningless anymore. You can add Who's Who to that list as well. They used to mean something, but they no longer have much to do with students excelling above and beyond their peers anymore. You jump through the hoops and you're in. Colleges know this now, and it doesn't count for much on an application these days. Your friend can easily outshine anyone in NHS or Beta by doing some unique community service activity or undertaking an academic pursuit that stands out. NHS and Beta really don't matter.\n\nAnd of course, GPA, AP classes, SAT/ACT still trump everything for admissions.\n\nYou will hear a lot these days from educators how everything you are doing now will make or break your future. That is ridiculous. Nobody expects a kid whose brain doesn't even fully develop until their late 20s to be able to make such weighty decisions. What you do now will *help* you get in the door. But the door is never shut. Take a lesson from this, determine to do better, and move on.\n\nThe more you fail, after all, the more you learn."], [4, "Snitches get their futures ruined."], [3, "Wait a sec, is OP a grill? 0_o"], [3, "Hi.

At least from how you're telling it. I really don't see how a suspension was in order (or even what it had to do with the school for that matter). The kid was clearly intending to behave badly, and you guys scared him straight.\n\nI'm not saying you did the right thing...sending something like that to a 12 year old is crossing a certain line in my opinion. But that is a line for parents to sort out. This has nothing to do with school discipline.\n\nIt seems to me that, while you do share some blame in this, as a lot of it was your idea, the 7th grader does too, as well as your friend for going along with it (is your friend incapable of making their own decisions? If so, they don't have much of a future anyway). And I think the severity of the discipline is entirely on his mother.\n\nThere is a fine line between a parent who happens to be their child's teacher, coach, or principle not showing favoritism and applying the rules differently in the other direction towards their child. Both are wrong. She should ask herself if she would have had the same reaction with any other pupil. If not, she is in the wrong.\n\nCell phones were the size of a brick when I was in High School and no kid had one (though a few had a pager), so I don't fully understand how they are regulated in school now, but I just can't see this as a suspend-able offense. I liken it to leaving a prank letter/note in someone's locker. Nobody ever got suspended for that in my day that I was ever aware of. Detention at best.\n\nTo put your mind at ease a bit, or at least your friend's, things like \"Beta Club\" and NHS are pretty meaningless anymore. You can add Who's Who to that list as well. They used to mean something, but they no longer have much to do with students excelling above and beyond their peers anymore. You jump through the hoops and you're in. Colleges know this now, and it doesn't count for much on an application these days. Your friend can easily outshine anyone in NHS or Beta by doing some unique community service activity or undertaking an academic pursuit that stands out. NHS and Beta really don't matter.\n\nAnd of course, GPA, AP classes, SAT/ACT still trump everything for admissions.\n\nYou will hear a lot these days from educators how everything you are doing now will make or break your future. That is ridiculous. Nobody expects a kid whose brain doesn't even fully develop until their late 20s to be able to make such weighty decisions. What you do now will *help* you get in the door.

Get bullied, punch the bully, spend the rest of your life being confident and not affected by bullies.\n\nOr, the school cracks down on bullies, you never confront your fear, you spend the rest of your life looking for safe spaces because irl outside of school there are tons of bullies and you don't know how to deal with them and nobody is going to do it for you.\n\nAny way, best of luck.
