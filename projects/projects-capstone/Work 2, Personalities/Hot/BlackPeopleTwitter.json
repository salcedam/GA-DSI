I've thought about this a lot recently. Anybody else grow up all the way through high school quiet as fuck, painfully shy, unappealing, and got 0 attention? And then you got to your early 20s and you became less shy and and a little less quiet, and you start to put some effort into looking presentable to the world, and you start getting attention? But you don't believe it could be genuine and that every compliment is forced because they secretly feel bad for you? And if someone ever shows romantic interest in you, you think they're joking? So you laugh it off and you don't take it seriously. You keep thinking about the shy, awkward, quiet, little kid always were and maybe other people still see you that way. And you feel like you're gonna be by yourself forever because you can't accept that maybe someone actually is interested and maybe you're really not the shy, awkward, quiet little kid that sometimes still shines through. You keep thinking about the old you and how you were treated. I know there's more to life and I can find other ways to feel better about myself, but I think about this a lot. I'll tell you myself that I'm a quiet person, I've accepted it. But I do hate being this way most of the time because of how others perceive me.

I've thought about this a lot recently. Anybody else grow up all the way through high school quiet as fuck, painfully shy, unappealing, and got 0 attention? And then you got to your early 20s and you became less shy and and a little less quiet, and you start to put some effort into looking presentable to the world, and you start getting attention? But you don't believe it could be genuine and that every compliment is forced because they secretly feel bad for you? And if someone ever shows romantic interest in you, you think they're joking? So you laugh it off and you don't take it seriously. You keep thinking about the shy, awkward, quiet, little kid always were and maybe other people still see you that way. And you feel like you're gonna be by yourself forever because you can't accept that maybe someone actually is interested and maybe you're really not the shy, awkward, quiet little kid that sometimes still shines through. You keep thinking about the old you and how you were treated. I know there's more to life and I can find other ways to feel better about myself, but I think about this a lot. I'll tell you myself that I'm a quiet person, I've accepted it. But I do hate being this way most of the time because of how others perceive me.

Trust me, very few people do that. And if they do, move on. There's a lot of better people that will probably like you. And about the romantic shit, that's not true.

There's like whole film genres about it, when the nerd takes off their glasses and suddenly they're foxy, that's how long it's been a thing.\n\nIt came up in another thread here about anxiety or the like yesterday I think, but one thing that can help is really simple: \n\n- Think of the last time you screwed up really embarrassingly. Takes like two seconds right? You could paint a picture of it.\n\n- Now try to think of the last time you remember someone else screwing up that badly. Takes a little longer I bet.\n\nThe beauty and the horror of it is, everyone is pretty much inside their own head all the time. They don't think about you any more than you think about them, give or take. This changes a bit when you have children and all, but for day to day interactions you could wear the same outfit for 6 days in a row and most people wouldn't notice.\n\nIf you ever get a chance (assuming you haven't), you may want to try travelling alone to a different place for a while. With no one else around to reference, you get a really unique chance to find out \"who you really are\". A lot of behavior and even thought patterns are based upon your relationships and attachments to your surroundings and the people there; without those anchors you can be whatever the hell you want.\n\nIf you hate who you are... just be someone else.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "dak0yic"}, {"comment": "bruh", "id": "dak14h7"}, {"comment": "\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af ", "id": "dal2rl7"}, {"comment": " \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n", "id": "dak206c"}, {"comment": "\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "id": "dakcd47"}, {"comment": "\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12", "id": "dak187a"}, {"comment": "\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nI did it!", "id": "dakxrnr"}, {"comment": "that's another useless bot added to the list", "id": "dalk1dz"}, {"comment": "Holy shit, Reddit", "id": "damsjsc"}], [{"comment": "Give him that good ol Down + HP UMK3 uppercut", "id": "dak0ku8"}, {"comment": "I'm steeling this cuhs. #blessup", "id": "dak2gnt"}, {"comment": "Watch him give you that Mortal Kombat xray", "id": "daksowd"}, {"comment": "Toasty!", "id": "dalbua6"}, {"comment": "Did you forget?\n\n# \u2191 \u2191 \u2193 \u2193 \u2190 \u2192 \u2190 \u2192 B A", "id": "dakblw3"}, {"comment": "You forgot Start", "id": "dakqhao"}], [{"comment": "Some chick posted this on FB and it started an argument between her man and a thirsty guy \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "id": "dak4da3"}, {"comment": "gotta upload that shit dude", "id": "dakakvo"}, {"comment": "Ok here it is \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/hWjYE", "id": "dal6nim"}, {"comment": "Jordan is a fucking bitch", "id": "dalk7f8"}, {"comment": "I'd pull up on this nigga with them dicks", "id": "dalnrbj"}, {"comment": "Delivered!", "id": "dal9hrm"}, {"comment": "Seriously though...", "id": "dal636j"}, {"comment": "Posted it ", "id": "dal6pb4"}], [{"comment": "Pour some whey protein down the toilet.

Usually accompanied by a deep background check and a requirement to renew every 5 years or so. A system like this, with the ability to buy a gun by presenting said card, (with an additional quick check to ensure no outstanding warrants and what not) would alleviate most of the issues we have.

I don't mean that like the US can't do that in some films too, but it permeates *everything* in their cinema, people die of cancer even in their comedies and shit.\n\nSo I'm gonna focus on 5 in particular that I feel are all amazing in their own way but different enough that they represent well. Outside of #1 and maybe #2 these are in no particular order:\n\n- 1.  [A Dirty Carnival](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ca/A_Dirty_Carnival_film_poster.jpg)\n\nTrailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWtiC1JFRnE\n\n>Byung-du is a 29-year-old career criminal, working for the middle-rank enforcer Sang-chul. Burdened with a terminally ill mother and taking care of younger siblings, Byung-du is feeling financial pressure as a substitute patriarch. When the big boss President Hwang is cornered by a corrupt prosecutor, Byung-du volunteers for a whack job and wins the big man's trust. However, his real trouble begins when friend Min-ho, an aspiring movie director, asks him to be a consultant for the latter's debut film.\n\nThis is actually one of my top 5 favorite films of all time, it's truly amazing. Every character knocks it out of the park, the plot is super original and interesting to watch develop, and it has elements of comedy, a love story, action, tragedy, everything. If you get nothing else out of this please watch this movie, I can't say enough good things about it.\n\n- 2. [The New World](http://www.moviemarkers.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/New-World-e1375908748619.jpg)\n\nTrailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0leSGTSZ3n0\n\n> Story about a conflict between the police and the mob through the eyes of an undercover cop.\n\nHooooooly shit. This movie came out recently, and it's probably the best thing I saw this year. It's essentially The Departed and The Godfather 2 in one movie. I don't just mean in plot, I mean it's as good as both of those, seriously. All the main actors in this are huge Korean real deal guys, you might recognize Choi Min-Sik from *Old Boy*. Every main character is my favorite character in this movie, they're all so interesting and cool.\n\nIt's also supposed to be the first part of a trilogy, so you've got that to look forward to. If I didn't love *A Dirty Carnival* so much subjectively for the personal elements this would be #1 easy, it deserves it. \n\n- 3. [A Bittersweet Life](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNiYWVkZjItMWY5Zi00ZGIyLThjNDQtOGVhZjA4NDFhZThmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTMyMDkwMTE@._V1_UY268_CR7,0,182,268_AL_.jpg)\n\nTrailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P4YG73KHHo\n\n>After doing a morally good thing, which conflicts with his boss's orders, Kim Sun-Woo gets banished from the gang and narrowly escapeds death, just to come back for revenge.\n\nHYYYYYYYYPE. This one is way more action-y than the others, but it really showcases how Korean films can throw down on that front. I'm gonna leave this description real short because I can sum it up easily: It's Korean *John Wick*. What else do I need to tell you?\n\n- 4. [Breathless](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Breathless-affiche1.jpg)\n\nTrailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zzcGQkuTs4\n\n> A bitter loan shark strikes a friendship with a troubled schoolgirl as he faces his own troubled past with his abusive father.\n\nThis is just a great film all around. The main guy you see in the picture there wrote and directed it, and won like all the awards. He's a great character because he's just *such* an asshole, but you also end up really liking him almost immediately too. It's just a movie about life straight up, and it's compelling and beautiful and all of the things the whole time. Check it out.\n\n- 5. [Sunflower](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bZL_UU6Ip3w/VRh-rlY9RCI/AAAAAAAADIg/Ot0FtBIO3sA/s1600/VietGiaiTri.Com-12061-1248278240.jpg)\n\nTrailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SE5ioy3vCo\n\n> Released from prison, Taesik goes to live with an adopted mother. He takes a job and tries to live a quiet life with his new family. His efforts are threatened when a politician seeks to knock the family restaurant down to build a mall.\n\nMost people would put *The Man from Nowhere* here, but I am not most people. Sunflower is slow through 3/4 of the movie, and really lets the feelings of the main character sink into you. He's really a person who regrets his crime and is trying to make a proper go of it, and the movie showcases him trying to make amends in a really beautiful way.\n\nAnd the entire last 20 minutes of the film is a single uninterrupted 1vs50 fight scene, so... just watch the fucking movie because holy shit.\n\n==================\n\nYou can watch a bunch of these on YouTube actually, though the quality is kinda garbage. A simple google search can get you an HD version though, some are on Netflix and others are... elsewhere. Feel free to ask anything else, I got a ton of non-Mafia films to recommend too.

They get to carry on in a meaningless existence in a virtual space that itself has no meaning or feeling.", "id": "dankalf"}, {"comment": "TL;DR: a list of Black Mirror episodes you're sleeping on and why, mostly where the horror has to do to do with human nature and recent events, as opposed to anything specifically depicted in the episode. Contains spoilers. Also your list was pretty good, don't get me wrong. Sorry for the essay. \n\nThe Waldo Moment turned out to be basically a straight up fucking crystal ball into the 2016 elections, which retroactively turns an episode I thought was kind of weak into one of the strongest of the series. I remember watching it thinking, \"nah this can't happen. Voters are too smart for this style over substance bullshit.\" Then it happened. One especially prescient moment is when the original Waldo quits, and starts yelling at people outside the van to vote for the conservative, the labor lady he fucked (and fucked over) or even the libdem cunt but not ever vote for Waldo, and his producer takes over and yells, \"5quid to whoever beats him up!\" and I think back to those Trump rallies where Trump said to \"knock the crap\" out of protesters. Also when the CIA (well the American man from \"The Agency\") talks about Waldo as a \"political entertainment product, portable to anywhere in the world where we need disruption or regime change.\" That's what Trump is, a political entertainment product. \n\nEnough about the political, the episode White Bear is absolutely fucked because it speaks to those darkest instincts of humanity. Every time some asshole on the Internet says someone accused of child molestation should be killed without trial and their lawyer should too. I think about White Bear and the audience and participants in the fucked up groundhog day they made that woman relive. I see that blood lust in my fellow human beings and I know if you said, \"well instead of executing them how about we make then live the rest of their life in existential fear for your entertainment?\" and these sadistic fucks would say yes, and probably without a trial. I'm by no means pro child molestation or child murder, I'm just anti-sadist. I believe the purpose of the justice system, which it doesn't always succeed at, is to help us rise above that shit and not be fucking animals to one another even when one of us has violated the social code so egregiously. And I see people who want to throw it all away for certain crimes or for people they deem unworthy of a justice system. \n\nHated in the Nation is worth an entire 5000 word essay on its own. However those themes of extra judicial treatment from white bear echo,as well as the government spying apparatus against their own citizens. Because as the one guy says, \"oh save the environment how pretty but do you really think home office is going to pour billions of dollars into something and not get anything out of it?\" Then as an extra punch in the gut, if you're one of those pro justice anti sadist people like me you end up feeling this twinge of, \"fuck yeah\" when it's revealed that the hate figures on twitter were bait for the real fish, everyone who tweeted \"DeathTo\" a person. It's this weird sort of justice porn that can make you horrified with yourself even if you think of yourself as a principled person. The truth is you don't even get a true sense of justice at all because even in the ending you know Blue isn't going to go peacefully take the guy responsible in.

See if you can do any makeup work or waive a bad grade or something.\n\n4. Be honest with yourself about your situation. Do you need time away from school? Do you just not want to go to school?

In the 80s and 90s, just having a bachelor's degree in many geographic areas of the United States was like a golden ticket to landing a decent salaried office job. It didn't matter what your major was or where you studied, you would end up in some kind of middle income position at the very least. Many parents of first-gen college students like myself were still under the impression that a degree in anything will land their child a job that can at least propel their children to independence and better job prospects than themselves. These parents did and continue to do all they could to send their children to college unaware of the economic climate due to not having much formal education beyond secondary level. So we have teenagers who don't have an adult in their life who has been to college and/or holds a position that requires some type of degree and clueless adults that are bending over backwards to get their kids to college. This is why some kids go to school and major in things you believe are stupid or unmarketable. That first-gen college grad who majored in English probably thought he/she would easily land an entry level office job at [insert local company here] like their parents said would happen and not end up being a retail cashier because that's what their parents said would happen to people who didn't go to college. Sometimes when kids don't have educated people in their lives besides teachers who are for the most part liberal arts majors, this is what happens.

I eventually realized that I didn't give a shit about it so I stopped attending college for a few semesters. I'm the type of person that absolutely will not deal with things I don't like to do (many times this is not a benefit). Because of this, I did some soul searching and realized my calling in education. \n\nIn the few jobs I've held I've met people who are just trudging along doing these jobs they don't like without ever making any changes. I feel that there are plenty of people who choose majors that they stick with for no other reason than they don't know what else they'll do. \n\nMy parents didn't give me a hard time about finishing school or anything like that so my path to education was made easier by the lack of pressure to \"get my life going.\" How are the people with controlling parents handling that? \n\nAgain, we sell people on this idea of going to college and getting a job. The hope is that a person would put 2 and 2 together and look to exploit their own unique talents to give back and choose a major that goes along with that goal, but even as a teacher I am finding that you can't give a person 80% of the information and just hope they figure out the last 20 because if they don't have the perspective on the front end, they'll be lost. I'm sure that was a run-on but I think you get me. \n\nI stand in front of a group of 16 and 17-year-olds who don't  know shit about chemistry. And guess what - they don't have any reason to. So when I am explaining chemical concepts, I cannot take any piece of information for granted. I can't assume that with only the knowledge of the charges of each subatomic particle that they'll be able to tell me how many of each are present in a neutrally charged atom. I need to show them what it means to have opposite or like charges, then I need to show them that neutrally charged objects are attracted to both positive and negatively charged objects and from their help them make their own conclusions about the definition of neutral. After all of that, they should be able to infer the relative amounts of electrons and protons in a neutral atom. \n\nBut none of that would be possible if I just said, \"Protons are positive, electrons are negative, and neutral means no charge.\" That's only 50% of the relevant information (arbitrary percentages are arbitrary). \n\nIt's one thing to choose; it's something else entirely to make a choice with the complete understanding of the life implications behind the choice. \n\nAnd lastly, I got my degree at a small college in the area; the number of students that make weird faces at me when they realize I hadn't gone to one of the larger state schools is alarming, but it all goes back to the fact that they have no idea what it truly takes to be successful and have a fulfilling life doing what you believe in. To them it's all about the school you get accepted to. Degree?

Any advice? Guy below said to lie. No idea how I'd do that.", "id": "dand93y"}, {"comment": "I can only comment from my own experience, so take that for what it is. But I'd say don't lie, because that tends to come back to bite you real quick if things go on too long. \n\nFirst of all, if you're going to break up with someone, the way you do it is going to depend on how your relationship is. If it's been a short relationship, and she doesn't have anything more than a toothbrush at your place, just go to a public place and be honest but brief. If she has a bunch of stuff at your place, or if you live together, you're gonna have to deal with that appropriately.\n\nSecond, when you're actually breaking up with a person you shouldn't lie. You should have a couple of really clear, concrete reasons that you can tell them quickly when they inevitably ask \"Why?\" Don't get into a long conversation about those things, and don't get into an argument about them. Just state the facts plainly. Emotions run high, and it's really easy to get into that spiral of point-counterpoint-argue-promise to change-etc. etc.\n\nGo to a public place where you can have at least a fair amount of privacy. This is double if you expect someone is going to make a scene, you need people around you to make sure you're going to be OK. Have a friend nearby. When my younger brother did this, I parked my car about a hundred feet down the road, and he gave me a signal that we had set up beforehand. I drove by, he jumped in, and we sped off. It got the job done. \n\nMeet them in person. Don't do this over text message, or email, or the phone, don't be a dingus. Meet face to face, be honest, plain, and don't argue. Say something like: \"This isn't working out. I'm breaking up with you. You and I have some differences that we're not going to be able to work out. We have very different life goals, we don't agree on children, and we don't communicate effectively, especially through conflict. It's come to the point that I've realized I cannot continue in this relationship.\"\n\nWhen he/she tries to argue or discuss, just stop that right away. Say something like, \"I know emotions are high right now. We both need some time to process this. We can talk in a couple of days, I'll call you on Wednesday. Goodbye.\" Then LEAVE. Don't hang out, don't have those deep discussions. It's not time to do that now. You need to go and feel sad for awhile, or happy, or whatever. Keep your phone off, don't go online with social media, don't do any of that stuff. Find a good friend somewhere, go out and have some coffee, and stay off the booze for a few days. Really take time to heal. Climb a really tall mountain and breathe some fresh air (that's my favorite thing when I'm sad).Then, when YOU feel ready, you can talk to your ex. If you feel it's necessary. That's up to you to decide. \n\n**TL;DR, the key points: Public place, face-to-face. Know what you're gonna say. Have a friend on standby. Be brief, firm, and direct. Don't argue or discuss, walk away and go do something else for a few days. Don't be a dingus, don't get wasted, and find someone to talk to that isn't your ex for awhile.** ", "id": "dandlz0"}, {"comment": "I'm saving this for later when I'm sure if i think it'll work or not.

Also, box mags don't really alter the gun's profile while the drum absolutely will, making it harder to use in tight spaces and just generally more annoying to deal with in a firefight.\n\nAnother thing to think about is what happens when you have to reload or your mag fails.  The dude in the pic could probably keep 3-4 30-round box mages in his pants if he needed to, but I doubt he could fit a single drum mag.  He definitely couldn't do it if he needed to hide them.  And if the drum mag fails, he'd be left with a useless gun.  If one of his box mags fail, he chucks it and groups one of the other easily-carried mags from anywhere (Bandolier, belt, pockets, etc.  Super easy to store them).\n\nIt could also just be a stylistic choice, who knows.  But, there are a lot of functional arguments for box mages over drum mags, and basically the only thing that drum mags have going for them is the fact that you have to reload fewer times, but they take a lot longer to reload (even assuming you have another full drum waiting.

Some of it was state-sanctioned, some of it not. All of them dealt huge blows to morale. \n\nWhen John F. Kennedy said that people may die, and civilizations may fall, but ideas will always live on, he didn't account for how much harder it would be to mobilize people if their leaders died even if the ideas themselves lived on. BLM is putting that into practice and it's working brilliantly -- the FBI hasn't been able to scapegoat one wo/man like they used to, and the ideology appears far more egalitarian too. \n\nBesides which, BLM is fighting for *police accountability*, which should be something that everyone supports.

As soon as you get home, sit down in your room, the exhaustion will return, so my best advice is just *don't* sit down. Make a meal, watch a movie with your roommates, finally go on a run. If you force this for enough days in a row, part if it just might catch. Next thing you know you've gotten in shape, or made some friends, or gotten a job, or at the very least gotten a haircut.\n\nTL;dr -- make appointments.

Realizing that this was a profitable venture, large merchant companies and entire kingdoms would pay captains to sail their fleets to africa, where they would kill thousands more black people, capture more prisoners, and bring them back as slaves.\n\nEventually, tribal leaders became wise to this, and figured that if they negotiated deals with the white people, at least their tribesmen wouldn't be the ones getting captured and killed in a mostly one sided bloodshed. So yes, african tribes did gather other african tribes to be sold as slaves.

I've heard of pure slave raids on the west African coast, mostly Portuguese and Dutch, but those were early on and small in scale. To my knowledge the colonial empires didn't have the manpower/technology for raids to be profitable enough to sustain the slave trade until the slave trade basically became irrelevant. \n\nEDIT: I know Wikipedia isn't the most reliable source but I did find this:\n\n\"As historian John Thornton remarked, \"the actual motivation for European expansion and for navigational breakthroughs was little more than to exploit the opportunity for immediate profits made by raiding and the seizure or purchase of trade commodities\".[28] Using the Canary Islands as a naval base, European, at the time primarily Portuguese traders, began to move their activities down the western coast of Africa, performing raids in which slaves would be captured to be later sold in the Mediterranean.[29] Although initially successful in this venture, \"it was not long before African naval forces were alerted to the new dangers, and the Portuguese [raiding] ships began to meet strong and effective resistance\", with the crews of several of them being killed by African sailors, whose boats were better equipped at traversing the west African coasts and river systems.[30]\n\nBy 1494, the Portuguese king had entered agreements with the rulers of several West African states that would allow trade between their respective peoples, enabling the Portuguese to \"tap into\" the \"well-developed commercial economy in Africa... without engaging in hostilities\".[31] \"Peaceful trade became the rule all along the African coast\", although there were some rare exceptions when acts of aggression led to violence. For instance Portuguese traders attempted to conquer the Bissagos Islands in 1535.[32] In 1571 Portugal, supported by the Kingdom of Kongo, took control of the south-western region of Angola in order to secure its threatened economic interest in the area. Although Kongo later joined a coalition in 1591 to force the Portuguese out, Portugal had secured a foothold on the continent that it continued to occupy until the 20th century.[33] Despite these incidences of occasional violence between African and European forces, many African states ensured that any trade went on in their own terms, for instance, imposing custom duties on foreign ships. In 1525, the Kongolese king, Afonso I, seized a French vessel and its crew for illegally trading on his coast.[32]\"\n\n", "id": "daibo9i"}, {"comment": "Not really some came from lords but alot of the time traders bypassed the lords and just kidnapped them themselves.
