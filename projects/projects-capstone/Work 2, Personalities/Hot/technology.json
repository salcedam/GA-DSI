You\u2019d likely not be happy, and you may even petition your government to snarl at them.\n\nThe main reason why I\u2019m not extremely concerned is because, at least to date, the types of warrants being issued have features which make it less of a concern. For anonymizing software, warrants usually target a small amount of information. In particular, they target IP addresses, MAC addresses, and other information almost entirely for the purpose of locating the computer in question. **If** they continue to stop at this point, the concern is alleviated somewhat. An important component of good foreign relations is openness and sensitivity to the concerns of the foreign nation. Once they\u2019ve determined that a particular computer is located in a foreign country, they can go to that country and say, \u201cHey, on [EVIDENCE], we used software to determine that [COMPUTER] is located in your country. We\u2019d like to pursue this case. What do you think?\u201d\n\nSo, while the most ardent of privacy/anonymity supporters will still be upset, it will be much more difficult to successfully petition the government to snarl at them. If the country does this all the time and our government thinks they\u2019re really doing more than they admit or going after dissidents, they might lock eyes, but in many other cases (like child porn), the government will be more than happy to *help* with the investigation. There might be a discussion over which government gets to press charges first, but since they started off on the right foot, this discussion will probably be amiable.\n\nAdd to this the case of botnets. Botnets are usually gigantic and have zero respect for national borders. Historically, it has taken [large-scale collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Tovar) by law enforcement agencies in many countries to go after these people. International law enforcement collaboration is not a new thing, and we have set up [international agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol) specifically for the purpose of fostering these collaborations and avoiding foreign relations problems.\n\nThese are not bulletproof solutions, but the fact is that there are no bulletproof solutions to prevent all foreign relations friction.

Obviously, there will be roadblocks. So with this in mind:\n\n\"Just stop using Windows (or Mac)\". This is impossible for so many industries though. I just came off of a 2 month sojourn into using Arch Linux exclusively and while it worked nicely, there were hiccups as to where I couldn't function with it 100%. For instance, there is no support for the Adobe Creative Suite...which many, _many_ people rely on to do their very jobs. It's not an option to \"just switch to GIMP\" either. And since the whole world runs with Adobe (in the graphics world that is), it's crucial just exchanging files with clients and working with other teams. That's just one aspect where using Linux isn't an option.\n\nYES...before anyone pipes up...I realize there are various ways to get Linux to run Adobe apps via WINE or Crossover or whatever. It's _not_ the same. It's a huge pain in the ass, really. Dealing with custom fonts is one aspect. (Seriously...I have to rebuild the font cache...again...) Also, they really need to make printing easier. While I'll admit that it's a failing of me personally that I couldn't get my laser printer to work reliably with Linux, it shouldn't be like this. On Windows or Mac, you plug it in...it shows up on the network...you print to it. \n\nBut those are just a few examples as to why just doing \"switch to linux\" isn't an option for many many people. So it comes down to two sides: \"Don't want to run Linux? Fine.

Sure, it's only $1.00 or less, but add that up to the millions of rides per day that Uber is doing, and well, that's a lot of money they're earning for not being as perfect as possible. **The 5 minutes after bit allows them to track where The Salty Spitoon is, where the driver dropped you off, and if you actually went into the Salty Spitoon, and adjusts your fare accordingly.**", "id": "dapcw13"}, {"comment": "You are hilarious!

When a middleman provides value or performs a function, it isn't an inherently bad thing. Cars sometimes sell themselves. For large purchases like autos, having a salesman (even a dickhead) can help consumers over the tipping point and get them to buy. Yeah, there are lots of scummy salesmen who rip people off, but taking dealerships out of the equation doesn't remove the danger of getting scammed, it just makes it harder to figure out the new form of the scam, be it a TV commercial, fake reviews, etc.\n\n\nThere is a danger in vertical integration, which is sort of what Tesla is doing. By owning and running the car factory and dealerships, if one fails, the whole entity comes down and hurts more employees. An independent dealership can switch from Ford to Chevy if Ford goes out of business. I know dealerships arent exactly the ideal example of why vertical integration is dangerous, but it is a step towards that.\n\n\nUnchecked vertical integration would be if Tesla bought a rubber company to make their own tires, developed and manufactured their own batteries, refined their own plastics, drilled for the oil for plastics, sold their cars themselves, ran auto shops for their cars, ran hospitals for Tesla employees' healthcare, ran their own refueling stations, etc. While vertical integration usually drives down costs for both manufacturer and consumer in the short term, in the long term it drives out competition when one company can provide a widget of the same quality for half the price of their competitor's widget. \n\n\nIf Tesla devices to start running mechanics shops that service their own cars, they have an advantage no other mechanic shop will have, direct access to repair and diagnostic tools, and replacement parts at cost. They could afford to bid mechanic labor at 75% of the bid your local mechanic offers. That's great for consumers until this advantage puts all mechanics off of being able to work on Teslas. Now the only game in town to get auto work done is through a Tesla mechanic shop. That might put people off buying the cars though, so instead Tesla could keep consumer maintenance costs low and thus drive up the value of their primary product, the cars. As the car sales improve, they can use the profits to continue to eliminate suppliers and logistical costs by doing those things themselves, further dropping the costs of their main product. They can start buying out competition and get big enough that only one car manufacturer exists.

When it was created it promoted competition. Now it's used as a tool to prevent it.\n\nEarly car dealers took on the burden of making cars desirable. Not only certain brands of cars, but the concept of an automobile in general. Manufacturers have a high cost when producing cars, and that's a very big risk if they don't sell, or sell in a reasonable time frame. Very easy to go out of business and be unable to produce more. Dealers purchase the cars in bulk and float the cost of inventory so that manufacturers can focus on production.\n\nWhen these early dealers would open up in a region, they had to build a market and create demand for automobiles. Eventually, the concept of owning a car would be common and at least somewhat desirable among the population in that region.\n\nImagine, though, a dealer taking all that risk, working hard to build demand for a new product, and then the manufacturer setting up their own lot across the street. The maker benefits from all of the demand the dealer has created, and can subsequently run the dealer out of business by selling at first-party cost.\n\nThese laws were necessary to protect dealers from manufacturers in an industry that has a lot of risk and high-dollar items. I'd imagine it also protected the banks that issued loans to new dealership startups. A couple of dealers go bankrupt and the bank is screwed.\n\nIt also allows new car brands to enter the market easier since one dealer can sell multiple brands of cars. We have our bustling competitive auto market today thanks to laws like these being implemented in the beginning. Are they still necessary in today's world? Probably not, since the demand has pretty much peaked, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to say.\n\nSome states straight up outlawed manufacturer-owned lots, while others, like Virginia, only made them prove they wouldn't be taking market share from existing dealers. Since there aren't any dealers that sell Tesla cars, and very few if any that sell electric cars, it seems they've passed that requirement.", "id": "daou5y2"}, {"comment": "Sounds like a pretty risky business model to open a dealership for non established product like cars would have been at the time you are describing when these laws were made.\n\nIsn't it more common in all industries for manufacturers to sell direct until there is an established market, just like Tesla are doing now?

Does the FBI now have a legal right to hack any computer anywhere in the world?", "id": "daoc41b"}, {"comment": "There is a concern that if judges are able to issue warrants for computers whose location cannot be determined, they might search computers located outside of *any* jurisdiction of the US. This is absolutely true, and it is a potential problem. Imagine that some law enforcement in another country got a warrant from their government to remotely search your computer. You\u2019d likely not be happy, and you may even petition your government to snarl at them.\n\nThe main reason why I\u2019m not extremely concerned is because, at least to date, the types of warrants being issued have features which make it less of a concern. For anonymizing software, warrants usually target a small amount of information. In particular, they target IP addresses, MAC addresses, and other information almost entirely for the purpose of locating the computer in question. **If** they continue to stop at this point, the concern is alleviated somewhat. An important component of good foreign relations is openness and sensitivity to the concerns of the foreign nation. Once they\u2019ve determined that a particular computer is located in a foreign country, they can go to that country and say, \u201cHey, on [EVIDENCE], we used software to determine that [COMPUTER] is located in your country. We\u2019d like to pursue this case. What do you think?\u201d\n\nSo, while the most ardent of privacy/anonymity supporters will still be upset, it will be much more difficult to successfully petition the government to snarl at them. If the country does this all the time and our government thinks they\u2019re really doing more than they admit or going after dissidents, they might lock eyes, but in many other cases (like child porn), the government will be more than happy to *help* with the investigation. There might be a discussion over which government gets to press charges first, but since they started off on the right foot, this discussion will probably be amiable.\n\nAdd to this the case of botnets. Botnets are usually gigantic and have zero respect for national borders. Historically, it has taken [large-scale collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Tovar) by law enforcement agencies in many countries to go after these people.

(And yes, we've got evidence to back us up. None of this is loopy conspiracy talk.)\n\nOk, let's hear some of this evidence:\n\n> ...a man we met at the big camp...was the first to allege... that the planes flying over were equipped with what he called \"scramblers,\" which \"fed white noise into the cell signals\" to interfere with internet access at Standing Rock and \"keep information from getting out.\"\n\n... Except none of those things make any sense, and \"a man\" who \"used to be in IT\" isn't really a credible source\n\nThen the talk about StingRays being the culprit of everything from camera apps opening to phones and computers mysteriously powering themselves on... Except, again that's not how *any* of this works.\n\nIf your phone is in Airplane mode, it literally shuts the wireless radios off. That's called an air-gap, you can't access the device wirelessly, period, and certainly no way to remotely drain battery. And even if you did connect to a StingRay and transfer some data, it is highly unlikely they circumvented Google's SSL certificates to start hacking people's GMail accounts, otherwise Cracked just unwittingly stumbled on the next big conspiracy-proven-true of 2016.\n\nShowing a screenshot (one tiny enough a human conveniently cannot read it by the way) from Wireshark showing a bunch of ARP requests really means very little without additional context, starting with you would be able to track down an offending device pretty quickly if you knew even the basics of Wireshark to begin with. And honestly, if someone is nefariously ARPing on your network you have bigger problems than being DDOSed, like the fact that an intruder is literally on your fucking network and you should be changing the WPA key.\n\nHere's what I think is actually going on:\n\n- They're in a rural area with poor cellular reception and probably not designed for high-density (ie lots of people). What happens when you go to a baseball game and use your data? Same thing happens when a bunch of people do the same in an empty field.\n\n- A poorly configured WiFi network, or client device on the network, is resulting in higher-than-normal broadcast traffic\n\n- OR the WPA key (assuming that's what they're using) got passed around via word of mouth and made its way to a nefarious person who is now on the network\n\n- While I would not be surprised if at least one government agency has been using Stingrays out there, I highly highly doubt that has anything to do with Gmail accounts getting hacked or batteries draining. I could see someone setting up a MiTM insecure WiFi and collecting passwords via fake portal, but that's pretty extreme, and I think you'd notice someone walking around and/or planting rogue WiFi equipment in your tent camp, right?\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I come back to Cracked.com's opening quote about having evidence to back up something even they claim sounds like conspiracy talk, and then do nothing to actually do so.

None of this is loopy conspiracy talk.)\n\nOk, let's hear some of this evidence:\n\n> ...a man we met at the big camp...was the first to allege... that the planes flying over were equipped with what he called \"scramblers,\" which \"fed white noise into the cell signals\" to interfere with internet access at Standing Rock and \"keep information from getting out.\"\n\n...

Except, again that's not how *any* of this works.\n\nIf your phone is in Airplane mode, it literally shuts the wireless radios off. That's called an air-gap, you can't access the device wirelessly, period, and certainly no way to remotely drain battery. And even if you did connect to a StingRay and transfer some data, it is highly unlikely they circumvented Google's SSL certificates to start hacking people's GMail accounts, otherwise Cracked just unwittingly stumbled on the next big conspiracy-proven-true of 2016.\n\nShowing a screenshot (one tiny enough a human conveniently cannot read it by the way) from Wireshark showing a bunch of ARP requests really means very little without additional context, starting with you would be able to track down an offending device pretty quickly if you knew even the basics of Wireshark to begin with. And honestly, if someone is nefariously ARPing on your network you have bigger problems than being DDOSed, like the fact that an intruder is literally on your fucking network and you should be changing the WPA key.\n\nHere's what I think is actually going on:\n\n- They're in a rural area with poor cellular reception and probably not designed for high-density (ie lots of people). What happens when you go to a baseball game and use your data? Same thing happens when a bunch of people do the same in an empty field.\n\n- A poorly configured WiFi network, or client device on the network, is resulting in higher-than-normal broadcast traffic\n\n- OR the WPA key (assuming that's what they're using) got passed around via word of mouth and made its way to a nefarious person who is now on the network\n\n- While I would not be surprised if at least one government agency has been using Stingrays out there, I highly highly doubt that has anything to do with Gmail accounts getting hacked or batteries draining. I could see someone setting up a MiTM insecure WiFi and collecting passwords via fake portal, but that's pretty extreme, and I think you'd notice someone walking around and/or planting rogue WiFi equipment in your tent camp, right?\n\n\nAt the end of the day, I come back to Cracked.com's opening quote about having evidence to back up something even they claim sounds like conspiracy talk, and then do nothing to actually do so.

It's even 50% more expensive than peaking sources. And the utilities are not allowed to simply refuse to buy it. This raises the cost of electricity and they pass this on to other customers. That means any customer who cannot install solar (renters) or in buildings that cannot cover their energy use (virtually all commercial and industrial) their electricity prices go up a lot.

The subsidies should be scaled back now that solar is affordable without subsidies. Even if you want to continue to subsidize it, subsidizing it this much doesn't make sense. And forcing utilities to subsidize it like this turns the utilities into enemies of residential solar. If you were forced to buy all the residential solar power in a state at an inflated price you would work to try to reduce the amount of residential solar power too.\n\nWe have to make residential solar fit into our system financially. Then the utilities won't need to try to eliminate it, everyone can be for it.\n\nThe other problem is that with net metering being so lucrative, there is no incentive for people to install home energy storage.

Anonymity and the ability to dodge censorship.\n\nTor is awesome though. Even just using it to visit clearnet sites routes you through multiple nodes and adds extra layers of encryption to your connection.\n\n**Edit:** I would like to add that, even when using Tor, make sure you are also using HTTPS everywhere. Tor is just an extra layer of encryption on traffic. It's only supposed to be an extra layer, and not a replacement. \n\n**Edit 2:** Here are a list of things I advocate using for anonymity online\n\n1. VPN (please be aware that VPNs [do carry security risks of their own](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/war-anonymous-british-spies-attacked-hackers-snowden-docs-show-n21361))\n2. Tor (same as above, read the comments below)\n3. HTTPS Everywhere\n4. ~~Ghostery~~, **Edit 5:** A number of people have pointed out that Ghostery is getting obsolete and there is nothing it can do that uBlock Origin can't already do\n5. PGP Keys for email\n6. End to End encrypted chat programs (i.e. ~~Telegram~~ **Edit 4:** /u/djdadi pointed out that telegram is known to have some security flaws and suggests [Signal](https://whispersystems.org/) instead)\n7. Using an 'incognito' operating system like [Tails Os](https://tails.boum.org/)\n8. [NoScript](http://noscript.net/)\n9. uBlock Origin\n10. Disable flash and java plugins in browsers\n\n**Edit 3:** Here's a nice [CGP Grey video on Encryption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPBH1eW28mo)\n\n**Edit 6:** Yes I am aware that Tor is slow, because of the way Tor works. Multiple layers of encryption and routing, takes time. I am also aware that browsing clearnet sites can be a pain because a lot of them rely on JS and the ~~standard~~ best practice for Tor browsing is to have JS disabled. All of these issues **don't** just apply to Tor. VPNs can also cause security problems for JS. Your browser can cause security problems with JS if it's not sandboxed well. However the key difference between Tor and a VPN is that a VPN represents a single point of failure for your anonymity, where as with Tor you only have to trust that a subset of the routing nodes are secure. However the trade off is that a VPN is faster while Tor is much slower. \n\nI feel it's also worth pointing out again that Tor and VPN services are only good for Anonymising your connection. It is **YOUR** responsibility to make sure that you are connecting only to sites that offer SSL/TLS connections. It is **YOUR** responsibility to not divulge sensitive information online. \n\nAll of these things I have listed are great ***if*** you use them in a secure fashion. Educate yourselves on encryption best practices and online safety. Learn to understand the inherent risks of Javascript, Flash and Java Applets. \n\n**Education is the most important and crucial tool in your arsenal. Use it.**\n\n### Edit 7: Apparently I need to make this Clearer for people. Using these services is not a guarantee of anonymity. Using these services does not guarantee that you will not be snooped on. They are tools designed to do the best they can to make you anonymous. *However* A skilled attacker with enough time and resources if they look hard enough will eventually be able to snoop you. This applies to *anything* you do online. These are not \"bulletproof\" solutions. You still need to go an educate yourself on how to best use them, and what best practices are. You still need to learn how to be safe online.

Transformers, for instance, are wound with both the high voltage and low voltage side in very close proximity so proper insulation is critical. In order to pass safety inspections, electronic devices must adhere to standards which specify things like insulation quality and minimum distances between high voltage and low voltage traces on the circuit board.\n\nI know from personal experience that in cheap chargers (in general, not just Apple knock-offs), you can barely fit a razor blade between what comes out of the wall and what goes right into your phone. This is a huge problem, especially with the poor overall build quality of these devices. If you open them up, they look they've been soldered by a little kid using reused parts--likely because they were. This means parts that jiggle loose, pools of flux, and even little bits of solder splashes rattling around freely. All of this is ready to bridge those razor thin gaps and put the full wall voltage down that charge cable.\n\nGood chargers put the high voltage stuff clearly on one side and the low voltage on the other, sometimes with physical cutouts removed from the circuit board to make the gap even more pronounced. Good chargers use high quality transformers and also provide clean power using filtering and control circuitry.\n\n[Here's an example](http://www.righto.com/2016/03/counterfeit-macbook-charger-teardown.html) of a counterfeit Macbook charger. Look at that gap under the \"What's wrong with this charger\" heading. \n\nOne more personal example--I bought a super cheap power supply off Amazon to power up a hard drive I was trying to recover data off of. It caught on fire 20 minutes later. Luckily I was still there and it was on my electronics lab bench with a fire extinguisher nearby. There was a short across a resistor controlling the current through an optoisolator and the resulting charring bridged a gap between the high and low voltage sides. Don't cheap on chargers. \n\nEdit: [The one that caught on fire](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OORN06/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

Instead, it's about the location of the property in question. The problem law enforcement was having is that if someone uses anonymizing software, it's impossible to determine where their computer is physically located. The website I linked to is on the ball and already has the updated rule posted. The additional part is (b)(6), which reads:\n\n> a magistrate judge with authority in any district where activities related to a crime may have occurred has authority to issue a warrant...\n\nIt continues and adds additional constraints, but this is enough to point out that you had it 180 degrees backwards. The *new* rule says that if it's impossible to determine where the device is located, they need to go to the jurisdiction where the crime was committed.\n\nNow, given that you started off thinking that *that* rule (going where the crime was committed) is totally fine and simple, it's going to be realllly interesting to see if you find a way to still come back outraged.", "id": "danuc70"}, {"comment": "So VPN good, yes?", "id": "dao2ab5"}, {"comment": "Quite good.

You'll still get probably better privacy than you can with a VPN (which they could relatively easily subpoena, depending on the country, although it helps that some VPN services have minimal or zero monitoring and storing of user data and metadata).\n\nSo worst case scenario, using Tor for visiting regular sites as an enhanced version of \"incognito mode\" is still a good idea, and likely quite safe. However, I would set its security level to at least Medium, and also use it in a VM with a safe snapshot you can easily revert to at VM restart, or with Sandboxie/Firejail.", "id": "danzn1l"}, {"comment": "From my understanding just using TOR gives them probable cause to hack your shit, and unless your running some custom hardened version of BSD on secure hardware, they'll easily get into your system with their trove of 0-days they keep so closely guarded.", "id": "dao1hry"}, {"comment": "> From my understanding just using TOR gives them probable cause to hack your shit\n\nThis is completely and utterly false. The probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment is independent of any federal procedural rule. Rule 41 literally cannot change the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment. If Congress stepped in to pass a change to Rule 41 that explicitly said, \"TOR is probable cause, lol,\" it would be ruled obviously unconstitutional, because not even a federal statute can change the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nWith that in mind, if you think that using TOR gives probable cause today, you had to think that using TOR gave probable cause yesterday.

They have to provide this probable cause via evidence *other* than, \"But something's encrypted, yo.\"\n\nWith that caveat, there is actually a divide on what courts can compel you to do (note that anything would require a court order, not a unilateral move by law enforcement). The introductory question is whether the key in question is something you have or something you say. If it's just a key file on a thumb drive, there's likely very little difference between them requiring you to turn over the thumb drive and requiring you to turn over the original drive.

If evidence that would have been illegal is used to build a separate case, it's wrong. This has been illegal for decades. In my comments on the Project Hemisphere documents, I pointed out that people likely failed to read the portion that indicates that they would be constrained to using data that law enforcement had legal access to. Thus, the problematic aspect of parallel construction is simply not in play. There are four scenarios to consider:\n\n1) Project Hemisphere allowed analysis on the entirety of AT&T's data, including data that law enforcement was not entitled to. This would indeed be problematic, but it's the reading that I rejected due to what was actually written in the document.\n\n2) Law enforcement acquires data from AT&T that they're legally entitled to acquire. They perform in-house analysis on it. No one thinks this is problematic.\n\n3) Lots of law enforcement agencies want to do this, but they don't want to dedicate internal personnel to analysis.

The 95th percentile is more like 300 plus. We are at the peak of a website obesity crisis and the trend as you can see here is not stopping any time soon.\n\nThere are two factors to every discussion we need to have about the web:\n\n1) Speed, how fast can data be delivered.\n\n2) Width, how *much* data can be delivered.\n\nBack in the 90's the solution was glass, fiber optic cables brought data at the speed of light and companies like COX laid down glass in major metro areas with funding from the government, tax breaks, and access to the unused fiber the government had laid. The problem that's staring us all in the face *right now* as far as net neutrality is concerned isn't an issue of speed anymore, we've already implemented the best solution for that (hard-lines anyway, wireless is still searching).\n\nAs we have opened up the gates on streaming services and sites that make 80-300 requests per page we are facing a bandwidth problem, we haven't kept up demand, and can't.

We have put in rules to stifle their expansion.
