Sad parts will seem sadder, energetic parts will seem livelier.  Where one emotion meets another, the transition will be controlled.  You could have an orchestra play without a conductor, and they'd play it perfectly well but it would be missing the sparkle that connects the music to the listener - that's what the conductor does.

Last time the GPU was sort of the bottleneck of the build (Although it's pretty balanced still). The CPU upgrade now allows for a higher framerates than before.

Also, when you're working on a computer or doing other close work such as reading or needlepoint, it's a good idea to rest your eyes briefly every hour or so to lessen eye fatigue.

This must be a really difficult time for you, and I hope she can pull through.\n\nThat said, I want to provide a little bit of clarification to people that don't really understand what **folding@home** tells us as researchers.\n\n***\n\nBiochemist here that primarily focuses on neurodegeneration. I just want to talk about Folding@Home and other crowd-sourced biological software a little bit because they get **so much hype** that is in many ways just clickbait.\n\nHas it helped contribute to our knowledge of particular protein structures and solved some questions in biology? Yes, absolutely. Has it ultimately changed our fundamental knowledge of a particular field and assisted us in better understanding biological concepts that we can then use to try and fight disease? Not really.\n\nFolding@Home is a pretty cool package and it is a way for the community to help researchers potentially solve protein structures/function. However, the question sort of boils down to \"what good are structures that we are currently capable of solving using computational methods?\". The answer to that, unfortunately, is not that great. \n\n[Here is an example of a paper on structures determined using Foldit, which is another of the crowd-sourced folding packages](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~zoran/NSMBfoldit-2011.pdf). *PDF Warning*. If you look at that paper you can see the structure if relatively simple. It consists of some alpha helices, some beta sheets. It's small. These are the types of things that we are pretty good at solving with computers. The problem is that these are *already* things we are very good at studying using many other methods. The real dream of this technology would be to solve large, complex protein structures, maybe something like [the GroEL/GroES complex](https://www.caymanchem.com/images/articles/screen/2130-2.jpg), which is a critical protein system in biology. [Some of the successes of Folding@Home](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4397) are a little more nuanced than this type of example, but are similar in a lot of ways.\n\nSo, it's a bit of a tricky situation. We absolutely need these technologies to get better, and we dream of one day being able to do a lot of this stuff computationally. However, the technology just isn't there yet. We don't have enough computational power and our methods are not necessarily accurate enough to really make them work well for a lot of different folding problems.\n\nWhat would be better? I wish Folding@Home was instead focused on doing molecular dynamics simulations of large complexes, allosteric conformational rearrangements and protein-protein interactions. This is something that we *know* computers are relatively good at but it takes huge amounts of processing power to accomplish. Once we have a structure that is known, we can then put it in a box full of water molecules and simulate how it moves. How does random fluctuations of certain elements of the protein translate across the rest of the protein? How does it's shape change? These are **huge** questions in biology, because it is the basis of how enzymes function and the type of motions proteins need to function to perform their functions in our cells. It sounds like Folding@Home does some of this stuff already, but I would really love a better crowdsourced way of looking at these particular questions more in depth.. This is also something that Nvidia is really interested in.\n\nIs Folding@Home going to help us cure Alzheimer's? No, probably not at all."], [225, "I usually see Folding@home promoted far more than [BOINC](http://boinc.berkeley.edu).

This must be a really difficult time for you, and I hope she can pull through.\n\nThat said, I want to provide a little bit of clarification to people that don't really understand what **folding@home** tells us as researchers.\n\n***\n\nBiochemist here that primarily focuses on neurodegeneration. I just want to talk about Folding@Home and other crowd-sourced biological software a little bit because they get **so much hype** that is in many ways just clickbait.\n\nHas it helped contribute to our knowledge of particular protein structures and solved some questions in biology? Yes, absolutely. Has it ultimately changed our fundamental knowledge of a particular field and assisted us in better understanding biological concepts that we can then use to try and fight disease? Not really.\n\nFolding@Home is a pretty cool package and it is a way for the community to help researchers potentially solve protein structures/function. However, the question sort of boils down to \"what good are structures that we are currently capable of solving using computational methods?\". The answer to that, unfortunately, is not that great. \n\n[Here is an example of a paper on structures determined using Foldit, which is another of the crowd-sourced folding packages](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~zoran/NSMBfoldit-2011.pdf). *PDF Warning*. If you look at that paper you can see the structure if relatively simple. It consists of some alpha helices, some beta sheets. It's small. These are the types of things that we are pretty good at solving with computers. The problem is that these are *already* things we are very good at studying using many other methods. The real dream of this technology would be to solve large, complex protein structures, maybe something like [the GroEL/GroES complex](https://www.caymanchem.com/images/articles/screen/2130-2.jpg), which is a critical protein system in biology. [Some of the successes of Folding@Home](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4397) are a little more nuanced than this type of example, but are similar in a lot of ways.\n\nSo, it's a bit of a tricky situation. We absolutely need these technologies to get better, and we dream of one day being able to do a lot of this stuff computationally. However, the technology just isn't there yet. We don't have enough computational power and our methods are not necessarily accurate enough to really make them work well for a lot of different folding problems.\n\nWhat would be better? I wish Folding@Home was instead focused on doing molecular dynamics simulations of large complexes, allosteric conformational rearrangements and protein-protein interactions. This is something that we *know* computers are relatively good at but it takes huge amounts of processing power to accomplish. Once we have a structure that is known, we can then put it in a box full of water molecules and simulate how it moves. How does random fluctuations of certain elements of the protein translate across the rest of the protein? How does it's shape change? These are **huge** questions in biology, because it is the basis of how enzymes function and the type of motions proteins need to function to perform their functions in our cells. It sounds like Folding@Home does some of this stuff already, but I would really love a better crowdsourced way of looking at these particular questions more in depth.. This is also something that Nvidia is really interested in.\n\nIs Folding@Home going to help us cure Alzheimer's?

I've also added a link to this thread as an alternative team to join for people that don't care for my content and/or don't want to support anything I do.\n\nIn the end it's more important to contribute the work to science then who gets credit. I recently installed (2) Pascal Titan X cards and they do amazing with folding but any computer or even cell phone that dedicates cycles to this is doing the world a justice. I'm even running this 24/7 on my Puget System 6700k laptop build with 980 and now it's a portable space heater.\n\nIf you want to participate and don't want to install the client and want to control when you're contributing easier just run the [Web Client](http://folding.stanford.edu/nacl/) and you can just close the browser tab when you want to stop. It's the easiest way to contribute if you don't want to have it running in the background on your system.\n\nI want to thank everyone for contributing regardless of what team you join and look forward to seeing this data go to good use at Stanford university and hopefully saving a lot of people in the future.\n\nTL;DR - Folding@Home is good, run it, join a team if you want -or- remain anonymous.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "daqmfzo"}, {"comment": "Better user experience?\n\nFor real I have my midle mouse button on a thumb button and it's so much better.", "id": "daqqcan"}, {"comment": "Click and drag the scroll bar at the edge of the window.", "id": "dar088r"}, {"comment": "What do you think scrolling manually is?", "id": "dar1ade"}, {"comment": "That only works on Windows", "id": "daqnbiq"}], [{"comment": "Space and shift + space > you.", "id": "daqs955"}, {"comment": "I love u", "id": "daqx758"}, {"comment": "You're welcome.", "id": "daqxry2"}, {"comment": "now kiss", "id": "darkx1a"}], [{"comment": "jokes on you, my mouse dont have a scroll wheel...", "id": "daqlsqc"}, {"comment": "how", "id": "daqz0jq"}, {"comment": "[with this](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/trackman-marble?crid=7)", "id": "dar2aqf"}, {"comment": "neat", "id": "dar3ams"}], [{"comment": "Like a Neanderthal.

Brian Levant directed it.\n\nAlso, you'll notice Spielberg has a ton of producer/executive producer credits to his name, some of them attached to really awful films and television shows (ex. ALL the Transformers movies, Real Steel, Cowboys & Aliens). In fact he has 3x times as many producing credits as directing credits on IMDB. To me this suggests Spielberg isnt actually doing much heavy lifting as a producer or even tied to closely to the films production at all, at least on most of these films. He was likely just briefly involved with the films development at some point (perhaps very early on) but not enough that his involvement can speak to the product's final quality \n\nMaybe he passed along a script sent to him, helped select a director, convinced an actor to sign on to the film, gave some advice on the look of the film, or whatever. Its not important because film execs just like to give him a prominent producer or executive producer credit because having his name attached to a film makes money. \n\nIve heard stories (not specifically about Spielberg) where film executives will take someone like Spielberg out for lunch, ask him a few questions about the script, show him a few storyboards, etc and at the end of lunch he'll have earned his producer/EP credit for essentially an hour of advice. For someone like Spielberg these credits probably include a hefty sum of money as well as several points (a percent of the film's gross earnings), so for an hour of advice Spielberg might make millions of dollars. Not a bad gig. \n\n**TL;DR - He was credited as a executive producer, not a director, and its hard to say how much involvement he even had.

Plans do not equal execution. Many movies are made with plans for a sequel...That doesn't mean the sequel was already shot and edited and is now in a holding bin for 2 years. Developers, film studios and even large scale software companies have road-maps and plans for years ahead of time. You have to so you can forecast staffing and infrastructure hurdles.\n\nThus you must separate plans from execution. What plans get executed are a function of the scope of work and the time-frame allotted. Again, fiscally, it doesn't make sense to execute the smaller, piece-meal work that is needed later when you have a sooner deadline with more content that is needed.

It's one purchase not 10 or 5 or 20, that is going to get everything as it's released. Once you get passed the whole 'buying something that's not done'...oh wait, I have to address it for your world 'buying something that's been done for months', then it's no different than any other bundle type package that many industries have.\n\n>Oh wouldn't they be released for free?

Historically, before DLC there were Booster packs, and before that expansion packs.\n\nWitcher 3 used free DLC as a marketing gimmick. \n\n>But one question remains. Are you a Game Dev or Game Publisher...\n\nIs this an admission that I might be in a position to know more than you do on this topic, as I have shown?\n\n>paid by Game Devs or Publishers?\n\nNever-mind, I guess it's just the 'I don't like what you say.

Contrast it with r/games, where the entire sub is little more than press releases and \"gaming news\", and it's a 50/50 crapshoot as to whether or not the mods will remove a thread, based on constantly changing interpretations of the frustratingly vague ruleset. I've had threads on certain new games or games coming out of steam greenlight into full releases taken down by mods citing the infamous \"rule 7\", only to see another poster drop an absolutely identical thread and watch it jump to the top of the page in less than an hour. I've had other threads with high upvote numbers get removed on the same basis, while again, nearly identical threads about the same game or news item with less upvotes are left alone. it appears totally arbitrary, and a lot of people are fed up with the schizophrenic moderating there. r/pcgaming is a lot friendlier in general, and although it doesn't have the sheer numbers or as much fresh content day-to-day, it's nice to know that you are not left at the whims of whatever moderator might be looking at the page that moment as to whether or not your submission will stay up or get taken down. \n\nHell, for example, I made a thread when the indie game \"Party Hard\" came out, basically just describing the game (as I thought it was an interesting and unique concept) and highlighting it as a successful indie release, which began as just a pewpewdie game jam submission, but ended as a finished and polished release, which is notable in an industry chock full of failed kickstarters and greenlight garbage. The thread was removed due to rule 8, no excessive promotion or self promotion. I attempted to contact the mods and explain that I had nothing to do with the games production or release, I was simply highlighting the release of a new game, as many threads do in r/games. the mods told me that I had violated general promotion rules, and wouldn't respond after that. that's right...in a sub that is literally full of nothing BUT promotional press releases and news articles about new games, my thread about a successful indie title release was \"violating acceptable promotion limits\". What the fuck?\n\nmany months later I attempted to do a thread on a then new F2P game called Fractured Space - people were disappointed with game footage from Dreadnought, which many thought would be a sophisticated tactical game about commanding large vessels, but ended up looking much more like an arcade space game. After getting some attention, the mods simply removed it and never told me why. Less than a month later, someone else posted a thread nearly identical to mine, and like me, presented Fractured Space as an alternative for people disappointed by Dreadnought footage. that thread stayed up. \n\nThere's just no consistency whatsoever, and the mods have little to no interest in explaining themselves.\n\nit's VERY frustrating to know that even when you are clearly following the rules and people are commenting on and upvoting your thread, that it might get taken down, JUST BECAUSE. it kills fresh content and original content (on which there are also a lot of silly restrictions in r/games), which is a big part of the reason why the sub is filled mainly with corporate press releases and what amount to games \"journalists\" blog posts.

Granted Skylake is a touch newer but it doesn't matter much with the small improvements made.\n\nChances are that AMD benched a \"[Zen SR7](http://hothardware.com/news/amds-8-core-zen-sr7-offers-core-i7-5960x-performance-at-499)\" CPU against it. Granted that was clock for clock in one task, the 6900x can turbo further by 200Mhz so would probably win if both were running at total stock. Like I said right now we don't really know if it performs as well in other tasks yet, if so though intel will have to respond though which is a good thing. \n\nThat said, if AMD's chips can OC even halfway decent (compared to the relatively low OCs intel CPUs are getting), no one would spend $500 more on a 6900x over a $500 SR7 model. Even stock if the difference is only 200 mhz and IPC is close the SR7 model would make more sense unless you absolutely needed that last few % of performance and couldn't OC (for ease/stability purposes).\n\nSo no it's probably not some super special best chip they can possibly make with the best binning on top of it when they say that they expect these CPUs to have similar base clocks to their intel counterparts (at least when compared to the broadwell-e parts).\n\nIll believe it when I see it but just being negative for the sake of it is pointless.
