For one it is a complete lie that he \"took money away from AIDS treatment to fund conversion therapy\" he merely suggested that public funds not be used to support orgs that promote lifestyles that lead to the spread of HIV.  This means far more than just orgs that support gay men, it means groups that promote a lifestyle of drug use, prostitution, etc.  Two as for the \"forcing conversion therapy\" meme that is complete bullshit as well.

He says that the comparison should not be between Trump and Hitler as the two are fundementally different, but of the establishment in light of their populist assent into power.\n\nThe implication being, what does the established political order want out of Trump, to what degree were they secretly behind his rise to power and will they be pulling his strings?\n\nYou can debate whether or not the directors of IG Farben were pulling Hitler's strings.  One would have to conclude from the Nuremberg Trials that Hitler went off the reservation, at least by the fact that they generally all got off scot free.\n\nI doubt that Trump would be able to muster the political power to send the US off on any adventures.

I think it had David Suzuki as the primary presenter/narrator. Talked about how various US/European agencies pushed an idea on a country only to have it fall apart because what the USA pushed was too complex for the recipient.\n\nThe general idea was this:  Step (1) US Company gets lots of tax dollars to build a fancy system in developing country to solve a basic problem Step (2) - Go forward 3 to 5 years, system starts to break down due to maintenance - the real problem is skilled labor to run and maintain the system in addition to money, Step (3) - the system is abandoned.\n\nOverall theme was: Simple technology is better for people without formal education, but are mechanically inclined could figure out, build, and/or fix.\n\nOne episode Part (1) talked about a large grain elevator or processing system backed by either FMC, Cargill, or ADM in central Africa - it worked great for about 3 to 5 years, big enough to handle and store all the grain for multiple countries for 3 to 5 years thus solving storage problems. It was \"state of the art\" super fantastic - could do everything and solved many problems.\n\nHowever it fell into disrepair because it was just to complex to maintain.  Part (2) talked about an NGO that went into to the area and taught local blacksmiths how to sand-cast simple grain mills from old truck parts. Another group fixed/repaired old trucks, another group (carpenters) built truck beds and furniture, Finally last group use those trucks to transport the simple grain mills out to the country side, deliver goods, pick up things built in country side.\n\nThere where multiple episodes, another one talked about a sewage treatment plant in ??Chile?? or ??Peru?? - that came apart, better solution was aqua-culture - specifically a reed & marsh area - followed by a Talapia fish farm, then down stream of that, where the locals could sell the Talapia fish in the market.\n\nAnother episode I think was set in Vietnam or near that area, farmers needed means to pump water - a powered pump turned out to be a bad solution, the better solution was a small pump that mounted on two logs {as floats} - a paddle wheel to drive the pump. The general idea was two farmers could use a cow/ox/horse to take pump to the field, then lift pump off the back of the animal - position it in a flowing stream and it would pump water.

I think it had David Suzuki as the primary presenter/narrator. Talked about how various US/European agencies pushed an idea on a country only to have it fall apart because what the USA pushed was too complex for the recipient.\n\nThe general idea was this:  Step (1) US Company gets lots of tax dollars to build a fancy system in developing country to solve a basic problem Step (2) - Go forward 3 to 5 years, system starts to break down due to maintenance - the real problem is skilled labor to run and maintain the system in addition to money, Step (3) - the system is abandoned.\n\nOverall theme was: Simple technology is better for people without formal education, but are mechanically inclined could figure out, build, and/or fix.\n\nOne episode Part (1) talked about a large grain elevator or processing system backed by either FMC, Cargill, or ADM in central Africa - it worked great for about 3 to 5 years, big enough to handle and store all the grain for multiple countries for 3 to 5 years thus solving storage problems. It was \"state of the art\" super fantastic - could do everything and solved many problems.\n\nHowever it fell into disrepair because it was just to complex to maintain.  Part (2) talked about an NGO that went into to the area and taught local blacksmiths how to sand-cast simple grain mills from old truck parts. Another group fixed/repaired old trucks, another group (carpenters) built truck beds and furniture, Finally last group use those trucks to transport the simple grain mills out to the country side, deliver goods, pick up things built in country side.\n\nThere where multiple episodes, another one talked about a sewage treatment plant in ??Chile?? or ??Peru?? - that came apart, better solution was aqua-culture - specifically a reed & marsh area - followed by a Talapia fish farm, then down stream of that, where the locals could sell the Talapia fish in the market.\n\nAnother episode I think was set in Vietnam or near that area, farmers needed means to pump water - a powered pump turned out to be a bad solution, the better solution was a small pump that mounted on two logs {as floats} - a paddle wheel to drive the pump. The general idea was two farmers could use a cow/ox/horse to take pump to the field, then lift pump off the back of the animal - position it in a flowing stream and it would pump water. Again - with the idea of a local blacksmith making the simple water wheel and pump.\n\n\n", "id": "dai7hvf"}], [{"comment": "I'm trying to get a hold of this documentary: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432097/\n\nUnsurprisingly, all of my searches are only bringing up results related to marijuana.

There will be only one take because it will be impossible to repeat. Roll the cameras only when I signal you to.' Then I told her, 'Pain does not hurt. Hit me.' And she hit me. I said, 'Harder.' And she started to hit me very hard, hard enough to break a rib...I ached for a week. After she had hit me long enough and hard enough to tire her, I said, 'Now it's my turn. Roll the cameras.'

If tinnitus is due to a health condition, your doctor may be able to take steps that could reduce the noise. Examples include:\n\n    Earwax removal. Removing impacted earwax can decrease tinnitus symptoms.\n    Treating a blood vessel condition. Underlying vascular conditions may require medication, surgery or another treatment to address the problem.\n    Changing your medication. If a medication you're taking appears to be the cause of tinnitus, your doctor may recommend stopping or reducing the drug, or switching to a different medication.\n\nNoise suppression\n\nIn some cases white noise may help suppress the sound so that it's less bothersome. Your doctor may suggest using an electronic device to suppress the noise. Devices include:\n\n    White noise machines. These devices, which produce simulated environmental sounds such as falling rain or ocean waves, are often an effective treatment for tinnitus. You may want to try a white noise machine with pillow speakers to help you sleep. Fans, humidifiers, dehumidifiers and air conditioners in the bedroom also may help cover the internal noise at night.\n    Hearing aids. These can be especially helpful if you have hearing problems as well as tinnitus.\n    Masking devices. Worn in the ear and similar to hearing aids, these devices produce a continuous, low-level white noise that suppresses tinnitus symptoms.\n    Tinnitus retraining. A wearable device delivers individually programmed tonal music to mask the specific frequencies of the tinnitus you experience. Over time, this technique may accustom you to the tinnitus, thereby helping you not to focus on it. Counseling is often a component of tinnitus retraining.\n\nMedications\n\nDrugs can't cure tinnitus, but in some cases they may help reduce the severity of symptoms or complications. Possible medications include:\n\n    Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline, have been used with some success. However, these medications are generally used for only severe tinnitus, as they can cause troublesome side effects, including dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and heart problems.\n    Alprazolam (Niravam, Xanax) may help reduce tinnitus symptoms, but side effects can include drowsiness and nausea. It can also become habit-forming.\n\nAlternative medicine\n\nThere's little evidence that alternative medicine treatments work for tinnitus. However, some alternative therapies that have been tried for tinnitus include:\n\n    Acupuncture\n    Hypnosis\n    Ginkgo biloba\n    Zinc supplements\n    B vitamins\n", "id": "dane479"}, {"comment": "If sting ever does an ama ask him\n", "id": "dane4kf"}], [{"comment": "I didn't know what tinnitus was or that I had it until a few years ago.

A compelling story of how a group of politicians try to protect todays society against the impact of Big Data and mass surveillance.| 2015\n[SILENCED: The War On Whistleblowers](http://silencedfilm.com/) | In Academy Award nominee James Spione's latest documentary, three national security whistle-blowers fight to reveal the darkest corners of America's war on terror--including CIA torture and NSA surveillance--and endure harsh consequences when the government retaliates | 2014\n[Nothing to Hide](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1587081065/nothing-to-hide-the-documentary)| Recent debates triggered a radical rethinking of how privacy in the digital age is conventionally discussed. As our social and personal lives are exposed on Google, Facebook and Twitter, the dissolution of privacy shatters social and personal securities. However, as we dare to say, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Is the fight over? And if yes, could we stop worrying and embrace the death of privacy? | 2016\n[Zero Days](http://www.zerodaysfilm.com/) by Alex Gibney | Documentary detailing claims of American/Israeli jointly developed malware Stuxnet being deployed not only to destroy Iranian enrichment centrifuges but also threaten attacks against Iranian civilian infrastructure. Adresses obvious potential blowback of this possibly being deployed against the US by Iran in retaliation. | 2016   \nEvery Move You Make | The first film to show the consequences of global Internet surveillance by presenting victims and their stories, from Syria to California. We see a community of white-hat hackers collaborating globally to stop these malware attacks. Will the Internet ever be safe and secure? The film includes a heated debate about whether encryption is the answer, or if it will enable terrorism and cybercrime. | 2016\n[Digital Dissidents](http://www.gebrueder-beetz.de/produktionen/digitale-dissidenten) | Digital Dissidents are the warriors of the digital age: Republican patriots, radical anarchists and cyber-hippies fight side by side for transparency and privacy in the digital world. For that, they are in prison, live in exile or have lost their careers and families. While many people celebrate them as heroes, critics, intelligence services and companies condemn their actions as an assault on our security. Why are they doing it? What are their motives? Available on Al Jazeera Youtube channel in two parts : [Part I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9oGFOvs1Tc) [Part II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT9Gm0hvDeA)| 2015\n[The Haystack](https://thehaystackdocumentary.squarespace.com/) | The Haystack documentary, is a real life investigation into 21st century surveillance in the UK and the Investigatory Powers (IP) Bill currently before Parliament. In light of Snowden\u2019s revelations in 2013, both privacy groups and our government agree that the laws surrounding surveillance need to be updated, but public debate and examination of the Bill have been shockingly limited on an issue that impacts us all. The Haystack explores whether the powers set out in this Bill will stop the next terrorist attack, and asks, are we willing to accept an unimaginable level of intrusion before it\u2019s too late?| 2016", "id": "damlh8v"}], [{"comment": "This might be good at the [/r/MrRobot] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/?ref=search_subreddits) sub\n", "id": "daldtlb"}, {"comment": "The voice of the narrator is very similar to that of the leading actor of Mr Robot", "id": "daqqx2q"}]]], "5g3825": ["History of the Cold War (1998) - 24 Part Series", "2016-12-02 16:23:42", 25, "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8hNHC9nbLlzb4miGp5pZPYCk9Zw0dGke", [[3, "One of the best documentary series I've ever watched.

What I suspect is that the fluorine is carried up into the tooth and then forms a complex with the calcium in the tooth, most likely this acts as a protective barrier.

I don't see anything that suggests his own personal homosexuality in this excerpt. That doesn't mean he wasn't gay, but just that this excerpt doesn't prove it. Let's break it down bit by bit then.\n\n>\"The Arab was by nature continent;\n\nIt starts by identifying the object. The Arab people. Continent is another way of saying sexually well-controlled. So Arab people are sexually well-controlled by default is what he is saying.\n\n>and the use of universal marriage had nearly abolished irregular courses in his tribes.\n\nIrregular courses is mildly ambiguous to me here. It could mean several things, but he likely means paths through life. i.e. homosexual, trans, etc. So with everyone married, everyone was normal. This is a fairly homophobic view, but it was 100 years ago, so maybe this was fairly progressive!\n\n>The public women of the rare settlements we encountered in our months of wandering would have been nothing to our numbers, even had their raddled meat been palatable to a man of healthy parts.\n\n\"Public women\" are whores. And he's indirectly saying how disgusting they were. And even if they were desirable to horny, male men full of vim and vigor, they still wouldn't have been appealing to his colleagues.\n\nBecause they were gay? Or because they were uber faithful? Or based on the few precious sentences, perhaps that they were completely in control of their urges.\n\n>In horror of such sordid commerce our youths began indifferently to slake one another\u2019s few needs in their own clean bodies \u2014 a cold convenience that, by comparison, seemed sexless and even pure.\n\nThe youths (which constitute the majority? The minority? Many? Few?) were horny, and began having sexual relations with each other. Though, Lawrence seems to note that there seems to be no love, but just clinical acts of sexual relief.\n\n>Later, some began to justify this sterile process, and swore that friends quivering together in the yielding sand with intimate hot limbs in supreme embrace, found there hidden in the darkness a sensual co-efficient of the mental passion which was welding our souls and spirits in one flaming effort.\n\nLawrence is saying that some others began justifying this and saying it wasn't gay at all, but really, it was making their fighting spirit and camaraderie grow.\n\n>Several, thirsting to punish appetites they could not wholly prevent, took a savage pride in degrading the body, and offered themselves fiercely in any habit which promised physical pain or filth.\u201d\n\nLawrence now says that some men found their own participation in these sexual experiences to be filthy (probably sinful) and so subjugated themselves to any chores/duties/missions that had guaranteed pain/punishment awaiting them. Like having to walk barefoot into the broken glass factory while covered in lemon juice so they could intercept the enemy's correspondence.\n\n----------\n\nSo tell me now: what among all this makes Lawrence seem gay? There's no mention of any of his own personal participation, no mention of his enjoyment of the events, nothing.\n\nThe only indicator here might be how he almost praises the \"rituals\", but that could just as easily be explained by a man trying to see the best in any situation, or an armchair anthropologist analyzing a culture not his own. \n\nAgain, not saying he wasn't gay. But this excerpt proves absolutely nothing to that end.  \n\nAnd I was joking about the erectile dysfunction and stuff. The only part that might have applied to himself (which I don't think he meant) was the part where he was talking about how he reference men with healthy parts. As if perhaps he didn't have healthy parts. Parts being his penis and such.", "id": "dahgasg"}, {"comment": "Ah. I see the fact that he is writing about the issue itself, and even acknowledging the act, to suggest that he is homosexual. The book was written in 1922, and at the time in England homosexuality was not even a topic of conversation, and homosexual acts were punishable by law, not counting just being a social pariah. Any suggestion of homosexuality would be extremely risky to write about. Most would not even consider writing about this, and would keep that part of the experience hush-hush. Lawrence puts this description in the first chapter of the book, making this passage very prominent. The only reason I could possibly fathom that he would write about this, is that he was extremely gay, and those experiences being an integral part of himself, he could not keep it fully quiet, so pushed onto the Arabs saying \"oh it was them who did it, not me.\" \n\nThe real kicker for me though, is this sentence.\n\n\"Later, some began to justify this sterile process, and swore that friends quivering together in the yielding sand with intimate hot limbs in supreme embrace, found there hidden in the darkness a sensual co-efficient of the mental passion which was welding our souls and spirits in one flaming effort.\"\n\n \nFirst off, is the words he uses to describe the acts. An armchair anthropologist that had just observed these actions would have probably used more dry terms for describing what had happened, maybe even condemning it, and explaining it away as savagery. Lawrence describes it with vigor, \"mental passion wielding into our souls.\" Those are not the words of an impartial observer, those are the words of someone who enjoys the act. The description is pornographic. The men at r/lgbt agree seem to agree, https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/54j4kl/well_the_its_not_gay_were_just_friends_excuse_has/ . \n\nAlso in that sentence he used the word \"our\" implying that he was also participating in the action. \n\nSide Note: I thank you for your very civil and intelligent argument, the internet needs more comments like this, and I found your comment to be a joy to read. If I had come off as dismissive, I am sorry. The dick in a blender part made me think that the comment may have been facetious.

They 1st try to make your life hell after leaving and 2nd try to dig up any information they can for further attacks on you in public and within the Church (so those in the Church will accept that the SP is indeed a terrible person and not question it).  They send PI's to follow them and even go through their garbage and what not.\n\nNot only do they do this though, they use the legal system as a tool via their large resource pool they draw from members.  They often file frivolous law suits against people who left and critics with the idea that it will deter others from being a critic.  They don't only do it in the civil arena but also in the criminal arena where they will create stories to the authorities in an attempt to have charges laid.  \n\nIf anyone wants to get a better idea of how these people operate, check out some videos that protesters have put up.  \n\nThey have an interesting strategy (and you see it on Leah's show when A&E puts some of the comments from Scientology in the opening) of simply attacking anyone who is a critic or leaves.  This has been a long strategy LRH implemented.  The idea being that if you are attacking you don't need to defend and are never on the back foot.\n\nTo get an idea of how they do this on a street level:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWHHaEsfKI8\n\nNotice, he simply attacks the whole time with irrelevant points.  If I didn't know better I'd think he is trolling but he is 100 percent indoctrinated and serious.\n\nThe protester in this particular video was later charged criminally and civil from allegations by the church.  IIRC, eventually all were dropped and he was found not guilty in the others but there was legal costs and for the duration was not allowed to protest or be around the Church. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_status_by_country\n\nThe US has exempted them from taxes as a recognized church/religion.  This has not only benefited them greatly in terms of not having to pay taxes but also an ability to sneak around labour laws which has been a huge growth factor for them.  If the stance other (and most) countries was taken in the US (simply not recognizing them as a religion is a good start and may be enough) - I think they would begin to diminish like most other cults eventually do.\n\nOne interesting point.  Non-Scientologists often laugh at the beliefs that Scientologists actually hold regarding the story of the aliens being thrown in the volcano and the tortured spirits living in Humans causing our issues.  Mike Rinder and a few others who have left didn't throw away these beliefs.  They didn't approve of the acts of the Church but still hold the beliefs and consider themselves \"Independent Scientologists\".  It is interesting to watch Mike Rinder on this show come across as quite rational then to find out (I don't believe Leah is still a believer in the story) that he still believes humans threw aliens into a volcano and their toured spirits  live within us.\n\n"], [3, "Other videos in this thread:\n\n[Watch Playlist &#9654;](http://subtletv.com/_r5fx86v?feature=playlist&nline=1)\n\nVIDEO|COMMENT\n-|-\n[Leah Remini Scientology and the Aftermath S01E01 Disconnection](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKWKA9Wpv-M)|[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5fx86v/_/daojjnb?context=10#daojjnb) - Here, not the best but watchable.\n[Max Headroom WTTW Pirating Incident - 11/22/87 (Subtitled)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWdgAMYjYSs)|[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5fx86v/_/daos8nd?context=10#daos8nd) - I think this is what OSA/Sea Org people feel like when they troll message boards with their pseudo-intellectual trash\n[155.10 Anonymous Scientology Protest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWHHaEsfKI8)|[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5fx86v/_/dap40sp?context=10#dap40sp) - It is great to finally see some mainstream attention being given to the real issues that occur with this cult.

They 1st try to make your life hell after leaving and 2nd try to dig up any information they can for further attacks on you in public and within the Church (so those in the Church will accept that the SP is indeed a terrible person and not question it).  They send PI's to follow them and even go through their garbage and what not.\n\nNot only do they do this though, they use the legal system as a tool via their large resource pool they draw from members.  They often file frivolous law suits against people who left and critics with the idea that it will deter others from being a critic.  They don't only do it in the civil arena but also in the criminal arena where they will create stories to the authorities in an attempt to have charges laid.  \n\nIf anyone wants to get a better idea of how these people operate, check out some videos that protesters have put up.  \n\nThey have an interesting strategy (and you see it on Leah's show when A&E puts some of the comments from Scientology in the opening) of simply attacking anyone who is a critic or leaves.  This has been a long strategy LRH implemented.  The idea being that if you are attacking you don't need to defend and are never on the back foot.\n\nTo get an idea of how they do this on a street level:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWHHaEsfKI8\n\nNotice, he simply attacks the whole time with irrelevant points.  If I didn't know better I'd think he is trolling but he is 100 percent indoctrinated and serious.\n\nThe protester in this particular video was later charged criminally and civil from allegations by the church.  IIRC, eventually all were dropped and he was found not guilty in the others but there was legal costs and for the duration was not allowed to protest or be around the Church. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_status_by_country\n\nThe US has exempted them from taxes as a recognized church/religion.  This has not only benefited them greatly in terms of not having to pay taxes but also an ability to sneak around labour laws which has been a huge growth factor for them.  If the stance other (and most) countries was taken in the US (simply not recognizing them as a religion is a good start and may be enough) - I think they would begin to diminish like most other cults eventually do.\n\nOne interesting point.  Non-Scientologists often laugh at the beliefs that Scientologists actually hold regarding the story of the aliens being thrown in the volcano and the tortured spirits living in Humans causing our issues.  Mike Rinder and a few others who have left didn't throw away these beliefs.  They didn't approve of the acts of the Church but still hold the beliefs and consider themselves \"Independent Scientologists\".  It is interesting to watch Mike Rinder on this show come across as quite rational then to find out (I don't believe Leah is still a believer in the story) that he still believes humans threw aliens into a volcano and their toured spirits  live within us.\n\n", "id": "dap40sp"}], [{"comment": "Other videos in this thread:\n\n[Watch Playlist &#9654;](http://subtletv.com/_r5fx86v?feature=playlist&nline=1)\n\nVIDEO|COMMENT\n-|-\n[Leah Remini Scientology and the Aftermath S01E01 Disconnection](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKWKA9Wpv-M)|[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5fx86v/_/daojjnb?context=10#daojjnb) - Here, not the best but watchable.\n[Max Headroom WTTW Pirating Incident - 11/22/87 (Subtitled)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWdgAMYjYSs)|[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5fx86v/_/daos8nd?context=10#daos8nd) - I think this is what OSA/Sea Org people feel like when they troll message boards with their pseudo-intellectual trash\n[155.10 Anonymous Scientology Protest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWHHaEsfKI8)|[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5fx86v/_/dap40sp?context=10#dap40sp) - It is great to finally see some mainstream attention being given to the real issues that occur with this cult.

This one is particularly interesting:\n\n>Being an American myself who has actually visited Cuba within the last year, I find the other reviews of this documentary to be completely misguided. Like them, I first saw this documentary and believed that Castro wasn't actually such a bad guy, but that the U.S. and Cuban exiles were biased and portrayed him as a monster. When I met several Cuban exiles who emotionally told me the stories of how they had their houses taken away by Castro and how their parents were tortured and placed in rat-infested prisons for simply expressing their support democracy, I thought these Cuban exiles were exaggerating. However, after I visited Cuba last year, I have to painfully admit that these people were correct in the stories they told me. I went to Cuba expecting to see racial equality, free healthcare and free education, as people like Ted Turner and Steven Spielberg had claimed existed in Cuba. What I learned from actually speaking to people in Cuba during my trip was a competely different picture from that portrayed of Castro in this documentary. Not to mention, I expected to see beautiful, exotic buildings. However, what I actually saw was building after building in Havana crumbling, with no electricity and on average, there were five to six families living in one two-story house. In one house I visited, the roof was partially torn off, one family of three lived under the staircase, two families lived in the kitchen, and three families lived upstairs, which consisted of two bedrooms and one closet. Very, very sad. Each day they had to wait in a line for two hours to just to get one ration of bread and rice. When I asked one of the mothers about the school system she explained that all children who attended were required to denounce any \"counterrevolutionary activity\" they saw at home to their teachers. As a result, many Cuban parents went to jail because one of their children notified authorities that their parents were \"disagreeing\" with the government some way. Imagine being placed in jail because U.S. law states your child must tell his third grade teacher he overheard you say \"I disagree with the Iraq war and dislike President Bush\" at your kitchen table. I also learned that when school children participate in a government march for the communist party they're given a coupon, which must be given to their teachers the following day to prove they participated. If they don't turn in their your coupon, the teacher will make a notation on a report card that each Cuban student carries from kindergarten until he graduates from high school. In addition to information about the student participation in all political activities, the report card also has information about his family including whether his parents belong to the Communist Party, a Committee for the Defense of the Revolution or the CTC or Confederation of Cuban Workers. In pre-Castro Cuba, the CTC used to represent Cuban workers and demand new benefits and better salaries for them. In Castro's Cuba, however, the CTC, exploits the workers, treating them as if they were slaves. The poor Cuban workers have to pay a fee to the CTC from their meager salaries in order to be \"represented\" by them. I was in such shock to learn these facts that I am now firmly convinced there is no such thing as a \"free educational system\" in Cuba.\n\n>As my conversations with Havana locals turned to the issue of free healthcare, praised by many ignorant Americans (myself having been one of them before this trip), I became even more distraught at the truth about healthcare in Cuba. The truth is that Castro has built excellent health facilities for the use of FOREIGNERS who pay hard currency for medical services. However, Cuban citizens are not even allowed to visit those facilities ! Cubans who require medical attention must go to other hospitals, that lack the most minimum requirements needed to take care of their patients. Most hospitals are filthy and patients have to bring their own towels, bed sheets, pillows, or they have to lay down on dirty bare mattresses stained with blood and other body fluids. Next time you hear someone say that Cubans receive \"excellent free healthcare\" (as I once used to say) please think again because that is simply not true. I spoke to five people whose family members died while attempting to \"float\" to Florida on dangerous, man-made rafts because they were so desperate to escape Fidel Castro's regime. Most people I spoke to were afraid to answer my question \"Do you like Castro?\" But their silence and weary down-turned eyes spoke volumes about the truth. Most people HATE Castro and think he is selfish, oppressive monster who has banked millions of dollars while the Cuban people starve and wait in line for rations of bread. I came back from my trip to Cuba a changed person. I felt so stupid and ignorant for having believed this documentary and other statements made by American actors and directors such as Sydney Pollack, Danny Glover, Steven Spielberg, Jack Nicholson and Kevin Costner, that portrayed Castro as \"brilliant\" and Cuba as having \"excellent healthcare and education.\" If you watch this documentary you should also watch the movie \"The Lost City.\" This movie is the story of a Cuban family during the Cuban Revolution and ACCURATELY shows you both pre-Castro and post-Castro Cuba. It depicts how Castro's government slowly began eliminating free press any semblance of property rights and freedom. The movie is fair because it portrays both points of view--one brother in the movie supports Castro and the other disagrees with Castro. The cab driver I had while I was in Havana told me that, being 75 years old, he had experienced both pre-Castro and post-Castro Cuba. When Castro took power he was poor and believed in socialism and the revolution. But now, 45 years later, he is no better off than he was before. At least before Castro, he told me, he had better healthcare, a better house and freedom to express his religious beliefs (Castro closed all churches and essentially banned religion) and political beliefs. Perhaps the saddest part of my trip, which still resonates in my head today, was how this old man just kept repeating over and over \"I should have left in 1959. I should have known.

So please, don't talk about subjects you don't know, but instead find out why this is happening and share in this love, power and glory Christ offers freely and that makes kings and queens bow and kneel and experience it yourself.  read the story of the prodigal son, what awaits a person like you, all of heaven rejoices.", "id": "dao0v3c"}, {"comment": "As a ultra rational person sometimes I wish I could believe in something intangible in such a beautiful way. Enjoy your faith. I'm being serious. ", "id": "dao0ysn"}, {"comment": "I used to feel that way too until I realized that using the potential for comprehension in the human mind as a litmus test for whether something is possible or not was a fallacy. It's a form of pride to think that our imagination and reason are the limits of \"Why?\"", "id": "dao3fz6"}, {"comment": "Exactly. Objective reality has no use for why. It's the one question that can be answered by the others.", "id": "darkoih"}, {"comment": "That's the thing,  having faith manifests into reality you can perceive in a way that strengthens that faith. It's a preparation of what waits,  the universe cease to be empty space and full of life, it's the path to this ultimate truth and reality, a full harmony with all life in the universe. So peoples, and really, we are all guilty, actions cause a disharmony a chaos, that ripples thru time and space and ruins others enjoyment of life.  We are on a quarantined planet, because mankind is thoroughly corrupted, the Bible contains the knowledge to heal and fix that corruption, to protect and defend yourself and others from this corruption, a path to peace, love, harmony, untold riches and wealth, beauty, creation, to create beautiful music and art, ask Mozart and michaelangelo, the path to real science and knowledge. It is incredible, it is the most powerful knowledge on earth, yet written so simply, that it's like a seed that sprouts untold fruits not only for you, but those you love and all the world and creation.  But you have to have faith and believe, in Christ, that what's he's saying to you is true, then ask for Christ to teach you, they also called him Rabbi, now if you're not ready for divine intervention because you'll shit your pants and run to a psychiatricist to pump you full of drugs, what are you asking. You have to ask are yourself for that level of experience. One of the best way and one of the most enjoyable ways to approach God is like Indiana Jones.  Then your life will be an adventure of supernatural and natural experiences that will take you around the globe experiencing and learning about these things and our history.  And along the way you will meet extraordinary people, experience their humble faith, incredible generosity, and strength , their love, their culture, they will share it, and you'll battle dragons, and save princesses and restore peace to the realm. You will be a better and bigger person because of it.\n\nThe world doesn't begin and end with a science book and July 4, 1776,  there is so much history and culture and things that have happened to get to this point.\n\nBut that's why it's called good news, this is only the beginning of life without end, and not a shitty earthly life with corrupt people shitting on it every time they get a chance because they feel uninvited to the party, maybe that's the reason they arent invited in the first place, but faith is required to truly see it and enjoy it.  \n\nNone of us have a choice in the matter, you can go kicking and screaming, or experience it tangibly and start enjoying it now.\n\nThen you too can have shit thrown on you, and see how people are truly behaving and understand why some people don't get it.  But as long as you're the best person you can be, a good person, you to will share in those riches, that even if you don't truly understand or believe God exists, you are believing in his words, because his words came before you, to light the way, then you are believing in God thru your actions, and that,   Christ promised is the path to heaven.  \n\nYours will be the kingdom of God, meeting him will just be a formal introduction.  But how will you not experience Gods great love by listening to his words and doing the simple thing he asks, to love him, as he loves you, to  love one another and forgive and help each other. It's impossible.\n\nunderstand that we are all fucked up, that we all need help, we all need mercy, compassion, love, we all need food, water, and a place to sleep, we can start working together with God, with Christ,  to turn earth into heaven.  A place of immense beauty, wealth, riches, love and peace, where we only kings and queens, princes and princess walk the earth.  What earth and humanity is truly meant to be.\n\nAnd people reject that because God isnt going around with a whip beating people to be good, that will only make people resentful,  they won't be doing good out of a sincere and loving will, but out of fear and resentment, doing good is not a punishment, it's an act of love.  It's the right thing to do.\n\nSo, ask yourself and try to understand the \"proof\" you want and the consequences of what you ask and how  you'll react or how it will effect others, if God grants what you're asking.  Will you run to a mental institution if an angel shows up in your room, or will you believe blindly not really knowing if he's really from God, will you shit your pants, so you have to be prepared for the kind of knowledge and \"proof\" you seek.", "id": "daob3hs"}, {"comment": "I take your opinion in the thread just fine, but now you're sounding like a door knocking bible basher.", "id": "daokcg8"}, {"comment": "Smooth.", "id": "dantw29"}, {"comment": "Quite the opposite, in fact. \n\n\nEdgy.", "id": "danurlq"}, {"comment": "Yeah, critizing the Bible on reddit is very edgy", "id": "danvd9k"}, {"comment": "Your so slick!", "id": "danynmz"}, {"comment": "People are raised in it, brainwashed from birth.

Additionally Switzerland acts mostly as transit country here. Germany ships cars and engines to Switzerland and gets fruit, veggies and fashion goods in return. The Swiss get the noise and the air pollution. \n\nThe Swiss were mightily sick of all those German and Italian trucks thundering through their mountains so in the 1990s they made a law that pressures shipping companies to use the train.

The Swiss are famous for being neutral, their army has not fought in a war in centuries. Building a tunnel just for the Swiss Army would be a total waste of time and resources because it would not get any use. If the Swiss Army ever really needs it, they can just close the tracks to regular traffic and use those exclusively.\n\nAs for using one of the lanes (tracks) for goods and the other for people, again that is a waste of time and energy. Why limit yourself in such a way? Train tracks work just like the roads that you are familar with, only difference is that trains drive on it. \n\nHaving a seperate track for freight is like forbidding taxis and normal cars from driving on regular roads and only allowing trucks on those roads - and then building another set of roads for regular cars.

Most \"black\" (or \"zwart\" in Dutch) people aren't actually black, just brown/dark/whatever, and to call them as such is seen as a big generalisation. Apart from that, it's most often said in a derogatory manner and in a negative context (e.g. some crime is mentioned on the news, and someone watching the TV says \"it's probably one of those blacks again\"). In more neutral or positive contexts, people typically use more politically neutral terms. \n\nThe exception to this are the Zwarte Pieten (nowadays there are multiple of them, and each has a specialisation, kind of like the smurfs, and they pretty much run the show). This is because, according to the lore that's accepted by everyone, their skin turned dark as it got covered in the black chimney soot. The word \"black\" is accepted, since it doesn't refer to their normal skin colour.  The word \"black\" is only seen as offensive when it refers to one's natural skin colour.

I know many people prefer to show their discretion or savvyness or whatever by wearing a less recognizable brand. However, there is nothing like wearing a Rolex.

Hyperventilation, or over-breathing, involves breathing faster and/or deeper than the body naturally demands and is often used by divers in the mistaken belief that this will increase oxygen (O2) saturation. Although this appears true intuitively, under normal circumstances the breathing rate dictated by the body alone already leads to 98-99% oxygen saturation of the arterial blood and the effect of over-breathing on the oxygen intake is minor. What is really happening differs from divers' understanding; these divers are extending their dive by closing down the body's natural breathing mechanism, not by increasing oxygen load. The mechanism is as follows:\n\nThe primary urge to breathe is triggered by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the bloodstream.[5] CO2 builds up in the bloodstream when O2 is metabolized and it needs to be expelled as a waste product. The body detects CO2 levels very accurately and relies on this to control breathing.[5] Hyperventilation artificially depletes this (CO2) causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people the first sign of low O2 is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.[citation needed]\n\nSignificantly, victims drown quietly underwater without alerting anyone to the fact that there is a problem and are typically found on the bottom as shown in the staged image at the right. Pool lifesavers are trained to scan the bottom for the situation shown.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_water_blackout\n\nJust saying...this really isn't anything mystical.

IT IS A PRACTICAL WAY TO BECOME HAPPIER, HEALTHIER AND MORE POWERFUL.\"\n\nOver time, we as humans have developed a different attitude towards nature and we've forgotten about our inner power. This is the ability of our body to adapt to extreme temperature and survive within our natural environment.\n\nBecause we wear clothes and artificially control the temperatures at home and at work, we've greatly reduced the natural stimulation of our bodies, atrophying the age-old mechanisms related to our\u00a0survival\u00a0and basic function. Because these deeper physiological layers are no longer triggered, our bodies are no longer in touch with this inner power. The inner power is a powerful force that can be reawakened by stimulating these physiological processes.\n\nTHE WIM HOF METHOD IS BASED ON THREE POWERFUL PILLARS\n\n\ufffc\n\nCOLD THERAPY\n\nThe cold is your warm friend. Exposing your body to it in the right way starts a cascade of health benefits, including the buildup of brown adipose tissue and subsequent fat loss, reduced inflammation to facilitate a fortified immune system, balanced hormone levels, improved sleep quality, and the production of endorphins\u2014 the feel-good chemicals in the brain that naturally elevate your mood.\n\n\ufffc\n\nBREATHING\n\nWe\u2019re always breathing, yet we\u2019re mostly unaware of its tremendous potential. Heightened oxygen levels hold a treasure trove of benefits, and the specialized breathing technique of the Wim Hof Method unearths them all: more energy, reduced stress levels, and an augmented immune response to swiftly deal with pathogens.\n\n\ufffc\n\nCOMMITMENT\n\nThe third pillar is the foundation of the other two: both cold exposure and conscious breathing require patience and dedication in order to be fully mastered. Armed with focus and determination you are ready to explore and eventually master your own body and mind.\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF THESE THREE PILLARS\n\nBy combining these pillars you instantly feel the benefits\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FREE MINICLASS\n\nIF YOU LEARN HOW TO CONTROL YOUR MIND, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION BREATHING EXERCISE\n\nWarning -\u00a0important message, please read carefully: The breathing exercise has a profound effect and should be practiced in the way it is explained.\u00a0Always do the breathing exercise in a safe environment (e.g. sitting on a couch/floor) and unforced.\u00a0Never practice the exercises\u00a0before or during diving, driving, swimming, taking a bath or in any other environment/place where, should you pass out, a serious injury could occur.\u00a0Wim Hof breathing may cause tingling sensations and/or lightheadedness. If you\u2019ve fainted, it means that you went to far. Take a step back next time.\nDo not practice the method during pregnancy or when having epilepsy. Persons with cardiovascular health issues,\u00a0or any other (serious) health conditions, should always consult a medical doctor before starting with the Wim Hof Method\n\n\nCheck out for our\u00a0free online video course\u00a0and start practicing today!\n\n1) Get comfortable\nSit in a meditation posture, whatever is most comfortable for you. Make sure you can expand your lungs freely without feeling any constriction. It is recommended to do this practice right after waking up since your stomach is still empty or before a meal.\n\n2) 30 Power Breaths\nImagine you\u2019re blowing up a balloon. Inhale through the nose or mouth and exhale through the mouth in short but powerful bursts. Keep a steady pace and use your midriff fully. Close your eyes and do this around 30 times. Symptoms could be light-headedness, tingling sensations in the body.\n\n3) The Hold, retention after exhalation\nAfter the 30 rapid successions of breath cycles, draw the breath in once more and fill the lungs to maximum capacity without using any force. Then let the air out and hold for as long as you can without force. Hold the breath until you experience the gasp reflex.\n\n4) Recovery Breath\nInhale to full capacity. Feel your chest expanding. When you are at full capacity, hold the breath for around 10\u00a0seconds and this will be round one.\u00a0The breathing exercise can be repeated 3 rounds after each other.\n\n5) After having completed the breathing exercise take your time to enjoy the feeling afterward. This feeling will be more and more like a meditation.\u00a0\n\nWhen you start doing these exercises we recommend to take your time recovering from the breathing exercise. After doing the breathing exercise and you feel good, you can start with taking the cold shower.\u00a0\n\n", "id": "dakvkvl"}, {"comment": "Hah! I believe I can explain a tiny part of that, although you'd be better off googling shallow (or now corrected deep, since it can happen in any depth) water blackout. By hyperventilating, you lower your blood concentration /partial pressure of CO2, which is the main trigger for your breathing reflex. At the same time the oxygen saturation will not rise as much, since our blood's sat is usually pretty good. This can enable you to hold your breath for longer, but if you overdo it, you will likely lose consciousness from hypoxemia or possibly - not sure if you even reach those levels that way - due to the rising CO2 (CO2 narcosis from a partial pressure of 70mmHg onwards) before the urge to breathe is pronounced enough.

To give her a chance to make her case.\n\n* He was eating you out did you say no?\n\n* After when he was coming up between you legs with you pants around your ankles did you attempt to keep you legs together?\n\n* You were wearing skinny jeans which are hard to get off were they ripped off?\n\n* Did you attempt to lower yourself into the sink?\n\n* Where did you sleep? \n\nHe wasn't attacking her he was giving her a chance to clarify how this was rape.\n\n**conclusion**\n\nYou shouldn't have to come to Reddit to get the truth.

Loans are like a particle/anti-particle pair (or maybe an electron/electron-hole is a better analogy causing money-\"current\" i.e. money-velocity). Yeah they create money when they create the loan, and can do so up to their reserve requirements, but then they have to provide the funds to whomever cashes the check. For their interpretation to be correct you have to take out a loan just for the fuck it and then destroy the money you borrowed.  \nMoney is leveraged (\"created\") by banks by loaning their money between themselves. This is really how the additional money is created and there's a known formula to calculate how much they can leverage - it is a function of their reserve requirement. A level of 50% reserve is required in order for the banks to loan out as much money as they take in. That gets them to a final leverage of 100% (meaning x1 not x2) after they loan between themselves. As the reserve requirement is diminished from there it heads towards infinity at 0% with 5% giving them a leverage of x19; 20% reserve allows them to leverage x4.  \n  \nMoney has always represented a debt. It's written right on the bill. If you have $100 that means you are owed $100 worth of stuff. What happened in the 60's is we left the gold standard which let governments arbitrarily control the money supply. Since they are liberal they think they are smarter than a market (they're not) and that is our current source of almost all of our boom & bust problems. We've socialized risk and privatized profits.  \n  \nThis whole thing is propaganda created by people who want your country to fail.  \nYou'd be better served by watching The Big Short than this crap.  \n  \nFree-market capitalism makes new wealthy people.  \nBill Gates was not born a billionaire. Mark Cuban was not born a billionaire.  \nThey are becoming a threaten to old money and they are trying harder than ever to crash the system.  \n  \nThe \"smoking gun\" for how wrong they are is other countries don't run deficit spending - like Germany - and don't have the looming monetary crisis the US and the UK do."], [15, "Starting out right at the beginning: \n\n\"Has been hidden\" \n\n - No it hasn't.

Her works in aggregate are by no means representative of a complete philosophy as are those of all the aforesaid philosophers and most other thinkers who, having earned the title, we now regard as philosophers, stretching back to Plato. Rather, Rand was simply popular fiction writer who borrowed some very fundamental concepts and terms from academic philosophy/logic (first year university level stuff, hell first class/first month in college level stuff really) in order to erect the flimsy and often desultory facade of intellectual rigor that one encounters throughout all of her writings.\n\nHer works should be the fiction or at best politics sections of bookstores, putting them in the philosophy section is demeaning to so many of the the greatest thinkers humanity has yielded, and insulting to the entire field itself. One can only hope that interest in Rand's work might spark a progression to more serious and substantive thinkers in those that encounter it, but shamefully it appears that her work is usually the beginning and end of one's forays into philosophy.

There's still a lot I don't know, but I have some sense of how deep each subject in business can get. What I have learned is that\n\n* People just inherently distrust finance because they believe it's just people manipulating numbers in a ledger to steal money from people who create economic value (which they think must be connected to finished physical product). It's immediate and knee-jerk. Mention anything about finance and people immediately think it's evil, like without even actually understanding what you said to them. The fact that they don't understand it is what makes it evil. It's like if you worked tech support and you told a customer they needed a new PCI card, and they said \"PCI cards are the devil!\" and this is literally the first time they've ever heard of a PCI card and they don't know what it does.\n\n* People who don't understand finance are constantly trying to claim to be experts in it and people don't know enough to spot bullshit. I've seen countless reddit threads of people where there's comment after comment of people talking about some tax thing or some finance thing that is simply wrong. Most people know that tax brackets kick in on the next dollar you make so that everyone pays the same tax on the first $20,000 they make, regardless of whether they make another $20,000 taxed at a higher rate. But people still don't know the difference between profits and revenues, for instance, so people (including reputable news sources) will complain about how evil company X made record profits when they actually lost billions of dollars. People also don't know what a corporation is. Like, just flat out have no idea. They think it just means \"evil company.\"\n\n* When someone who does know what they're talking about chimes in, no one listens. Of course I'm going to say that Net Operating Loss is an intentional tax feature, not a tax loophole. The source I cited showing it's an established part of the tax code is just an attempt to confuse people into justifying the fact that rich people don't have to pay taxes.\n\nI've just given up, really.

Throw in kicking everyone off of Welfare (Trump) or giving everyone free college and free medical care (Sanders), and you pretty much have the whole program.

Single payer healthcare is not \"free\" it is a system for which the government can guarantee every citizen a doctor without pushing them to poverty. The individual doesn't have the power to properly negotiate the price of medicine. Do you know why healthcare is so expensive? Because we have a system where not everyone can pay. So the hospitals take this into account and raise the price of its services so that it can pay its doctors and staff and afford equipment. This means we already have people leaning on the system after there credit is destroyed who basically just suck up welfare. Meanwhile any who can afford insurance has to pay higher premiums in order to offset the losses. The reason insurance companies can keep premiums affordable at all is because they have the resources to haggle with the healthcare providers. So if we move health insurance to everyone the price per person is more than likely to stay the same. \n\nHonestly legalize weed and tax it for health care funding. Defund the DEA. Put that money towards college subsidies. Get rid of abstinence education and teach actual safe sex to lower population rate increases and STD's. Pull out foot soldiers on unfriendly soil and let someone else blow money on it for a change. Take those costs to further education. Take away religions free tax status because if they use our roads and our safety nets they should pay taxes. Put a small less than a percentage tax on capital gains. Millions of transactions happen everyday. Take a penny off per transaction and you can spread that back into colleges or healthcare or k-12 education maybe subsidize a fiber optic network idk.

Under this plan, a family of four earning $50,000 would pay just $466 per year to the single-payer program, amounting to a savings of over $5,800 for that family each year.\n\nSo Sanders would take away all of the cost controls (deductibles, copays, networks, prior authorizations, etc), and reduce costs for middle class families by more than 90%. That is the definition of free lunch economics.\n\n>Honestly legalize weed and tax it for health care funding\n\nYou clearly have no idea how much healthcare costs. Western European countries spend 9-12% of their GDP on healthcare. I'm sure you smoke a lot of weed, but you don't smoke enough to pay for everyone's health care.\n\nThe rest of your rant is just as uninformed.

That alone wouldn't bother me, because not knowing something isn't inherently bad. What bothers me is the people who pretend to be experts on insurance, but say things that are completely false. \n\nSo many people are like, \"Oh my god! My insurance premiums are so ridiculous! Insurance is a scam! These insurance companies are making outrageous profits!\" They won't accept any data showing otherwise.\n\nThey don't get that insurance companies are the middlemen, that the insurance industry is heavily regulated, and that most insurance industries are quite competitive. And that insurance companies are trying to do what they can to lower the cost of claims, through things like PPO networks, because they also think the claim costs (and therefore premiums) are too high and they have an incentive to try to control their claim costs. \n\nIt is always so frustrating to me that people shoot the middleman when the issue is mainly on the provider side (in the case of health insurance). It is also frustrating that people don't understand that insurance is not a financial service that is meant to save you money over the course of your lifetime. In fact, the average person who has insurance over their whole life will end up paying more in premium than the average uninsured person would pay in liabilities, because the insured person's premiums also bake in the insurance company's administrative expenses.

Money is not the center of an economy, it is the lubrication that permits economics to happen.  Economics is the analysis of how scarce resources that have alternative uses are allocated by people (by markets).  \n\nMoney doesn't create those allocations, money enables those allocations.  \n\nEven in an economic system without money, there would still be allocations of scarce resources that have alternative uses by people; whether that is choosing to use your time to cut down a tree for your neighbor in exchange for beef or choosing to use your time to mow a lawn for your mother in exchange for a smile and a thank you; your time is a scarce resource and you're choosing how to allocate it with zero money being involved.  \n\nMoney is any medium of exchange and is created as a store of one's labor.  \n\nYou receive a dollar in exchange for X minutes of your labor.  That piece of paper stores those X minutes of your labor and you can use it in exchange for something you value.  \n\nSo anyway - this video does a shitty job identifying what money is at the outset... I don't think it'll get better.  \n\n**2)** The banking system, monetary policy, and politicians making a killing off of those systems has not been hidden from anyone.  As they admit, almost in a very quick juxtaposition with their incorrect statement, the bankers, academics, and politicians are very open about their systems.  \n\nThe problem is that people are just happy with their lives and are safer than they've ever been throughout history.  \n\n**3)** A complete misunderstanding of what \"interest\" is and what fractional reserve banking is.  \n\nInterest is the cost of lending money... it is the price tag on a product just like on the coat or iPod you buy.  The baker isn't going to give you all his bread for free; why should a bank give you money for free?  \n\nFractional reserve banking can be done responsibly.  Much like the interest rate, it should be done at the rate set by free markets.  A fractional reserve rate of 90% almost completely guarantees that when you withdraw, you will always be able to withdraw all of your money.  In exchange, banks will give you vastly lower of an interest rate than at a 10% fractional reserve rate because it is higher risk and lower reward for the bank.  \n\nAnyway - like so many other documentaries out there about extremely complex matters, this one is just trying to sell a product like every other good capitalist out there.  They need to catch your attention and get you to talk about it to others to make money - so of course they're going to play to the 8th grade education market.

When I started working for JPMorgan (I've since left mind you), we were taken on a \"finance crash course\" (I was in technology, but we needed to know obviously).\nAnyway it was pretty eye opening to learn how our world economies actually work. I kind of knew anyway from background reading, but there were techies genuinely horrified in the lessons. One girl actually started crying - because it was effectively a very well managed ponzi scheme. Obviously I'm being a little unreasonable with that descriptor. But there's a position to take on this, and it's the realisation that the whole reason our system works, is because we've collectively agreed to let it work that way, and a lot of people who would otherwise find it horrifying simply don't understand it as it's very nebulous.\n\nedit: having said that, though there's a bit of sensationalism to the video - I explained how it all works in a [comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/5f60e1/97_owned_2012_a_documentary_explaining_how_money/dai04p8/) as it's quite an important concept", "id": "dahyff0"}, {"comment": "Any points you mind sharing?\n", "id": "dahzj15"}, {"comment": "Sure, so the simplest way to explain our borrowing system is this. I'm a bank. You give me \u00a31000 and I promise you a 3% rate. Now I'm obligated to keep say 10% of that in my vaults for regulatory reasons. I go to 3 other banks, to each one of them I say \"hey I have \u00a3900 here, that I can lend out, have at it and give me an interest return of I don't know, let's say 7%\". Now I've only got \u00a31k, but I've just agreed to lend out \u00a32700 across 3 banks for 7% interest. The reality is I only had \u00a3900 that I could lend, but we just agreed that I had the money, so now they have that money. In reality \u00a31800 was conjured out of thin air, leveraging my 90% of what I got from you. Each bank in turn does the same thing, lending out \u00a3810 to various people, leveraging that 90% and keeping 10% in reserve.\n\nBut there's a problem here, say tomorrow you get spooked and you want your \u00a31k, I only have \u00a3100 to give you, don't I? But I don't have 1 customer, I have 100 customers and each gave me \u00a31k. So you decide to withdraw your \u00a31k and I say \"sure mate, here you go\". I've just given you \u00a3100 x 10 customers reserve funds. That's totally fine, totally allowed (you can start to see why banks love the rich on a side note).\n\nNow, the system will never fail, I've got some invented money that pays me an interest from the various people who've taken out loans, all backed by this leveraged 10% for argument's sake. Government's said I can only lend out to 3x what I'm allowed so for every \u00a31k I can lend out \u00a33k. \u00a32k doesn't exist, and the \u00a31k comes from a 90% deposit with the 10% held in reserves. \n\nSo, this system won't fail.... until it fails. Imagine a country gets spooked, and everyone lines up to take their money out (greece last year). Now I don't have this money. Neither did Bear Stearns back during the GFC (JP eventually merged with Bear Stearns).\n\nSo what do I, the lender do? Because fuck me I've lent your \u00a3900 out and only have \u00a3100, and you want all \u00a31000. So does every guy behind you. Well I start calling in that \u00a3900 from other people, but there's no way with my contracts that I can get it back.\n\nSo now what? I borrow from other banks, but other banks say \"jesus mate your books are cooked, we're not lending to you or we'll be in the same boat!!!!\" So nobody will lend to me to save me. Or some banks do and now we're all in the shit because people run on them too. (In Bear's case the Fed gave them money, and they failed anyway)\n\nSo where do I go? I go to the LENDER OF LAST RESORT (AKA, the Fed, or the Bank of England if you're British). They say \"well aren't you a dick, here have the \u00a3x amount you need at this interest rate and off you go.\" This keeps the global economy going and all is well.\n\nNow if I've fucked it too much (like some banks did during the GFC) then the fed or BoE have decided to make an example of me. They say \"We're not helping you\". Well I can't pay my clients whose money I lent out. I then go bankrupt, they get what money they can (but actually the big guys get their money first and the little guy gets fucked because their amount matters least - worse still, the big guys probably have insurance).\n\nThat's basically one of the things that happened during GFC. In a nutshell, it's terrifying, but the system works. The most important thing in our economy is consumer confidence. If you are confident I won't lose your money, you won't ask for it back in one instant, and I won't be in massive shit for having lent it out, so we can all start paying each other back with our made up money and get rich.\n\nThere is more money owed in the world, than actually exists in reality.

Loans are like a particle/anti-particle pair (or maybe an electron/electron-hole is a better analogy causing money-\"current\" i.e. money-velocity). Yeah they create money when they create the loan, and can do so up to their reserve requirements, but then they have to provide the funds to whomever cashes the check. For their interpretation to be correct you have to take out a loan just for the fuck it and then destroy the money you borrowed.  \nMoney is leveraged (\"created\") by banks by loaning their money between themselves. This is really how the additional money is created and there's a known formula to calculate how much they can leverage - it is a function of their reserve requirement. A level of 50% reserve is required in order for the banks to loan out as much money as they take in. That gets them to a final leverage of 100% (meaning x1 not x2) after they loan between themselves. As the reserve requirement is diminished from there it heads towards infinity at 0% with 5% giving them a leverage of x19; 20% reserve allows them to leverage x4.  \n  \nMoney has always represented a debt.

In essence the act of lending creates new deposits rather than banks using deposits to create new lending. \n\nThe approach you are referring to is the monetary multiplier approach and for it to hold the reserve ratio must be the binding constraint on bank lending. Don't get me wrong, it is an appealing explanation of money creation however it is inaccurate. \n\nLending conditions are the key determinant of the money supply. So if there are more profitable lending opportunities we can expect the money supply to grow faster than if there were relatively fewer. The profitability of these opportunities is determined by the cost of lending, i.e. the bank rate (which represents the marginal cost of lending). The Central Bank can control this rate on both the deposits commercial banks hold with them as well as on loans to commercial banks. These lending conditions determine the amount of deposits created in the economy (accounting for around 97% of broad money). Then the amount of deposits influences the amount of money the Central Bank wishes to hold in reserve.", "id": "dahy2t2"}, {"comment": "LOL.  The US and UK do not have looming monetary crises.\n\nBoth of those countries' debts are denominated in currencies that they control, and hence, both of those countries can always pay those debts and can never be subject to bond vigilantes.  They can only choose to default on debt, they cannot be forced to due to insolvency.  It is impossible to be insolvent in your own sovereign, fiat currency.\n\nJapan runs much higher debt to GDP ratios and has no trouble borrowing and enjoys borrowing at low interest rates.  Why? Because they can ALWAYS pay their debts, as they are Yen-denominated.\n\nGermany is a terrible example.  They belong to a currency union and must keep deficits less than 3 percent of GDP because of the Maastricht treaty.  Germany runs huge trade surpluses against its neighbors, meaning that they have the money to run a state without deficits by pushing deficits onto others.\n\nYou cant compare the finances of the US, UK, and Japan with countries that do not have sovereign fiat currencies.

I just realized something about our system.\n\nEveryones so focused on how our system's high rate of recidivism, but what IS true about our system is it incentivizes not engaging in the criminal activity to begin with. If you know that worst case scenario you're going to a mental hospital or to some kind of reform/rehabilitation program, you might be significantly more likely to attack your ex-wife's husband or something to that effect.\n\nBut yes. Perhaps our system is wrong. For one thing, while we may be trying to prevent criminal activity by nipping it in the bud, we still allow many to have guns. What people don't talk about though is that in England there are still guns, people hunt and stuff. And their police DO have guns, its just that not every cop has a gun. And (i assume) it can even be said that significantly less than half of them have guns.\n\nAnd maybe our system works like this: if you commit a bad enough crime, then you're already too far gone, so all we can do is make an example of you to show others. It also in theory could prevent you from further criminal activity.. but yes, the numbers suggest that it doesn't.\n\nAnd yeah. The worst part is the fact that money does seem to have a huge effect. Everyone is corruptible, and more expensive lawyers do seem to be invincible against the lawyers that the state provides.. Maybe you shouldn't be able to pick your lawyer.. Obviously that would be flawed to some degree too, you could get a fool for a lawyer.\n\nAnd the system itself is flawed. We say innocent until proven guilty, but thats actually not true. And there might really no one to blame. The problem is, when you are in a court room, the jury's default position, because of how the human mind works (generally), is that you probably have done SOMETHING wrong, otherwise you wouldn't be in this position. So you sort of have to prove your innocence.

Trump was never going to put her in jail because theres no real case, and theres no reason to when he's already elected. It was an empty campaign promise for the republicans who have had a long standing hatred of clinton.\n\nYes, trump donated to the clinton foundation, which is a charity. Far far different from donating to her politically or something. You can disagree with someone politically, and still agree with their charity.\n\nIt's a charity dinner that has long standing traditions. If someone were to refuse to show up because they disagree with someone politically, blowback from the public would be insane. I mean, if your Uncle jerry, the conspiracy republican who always turns every conversation political, shows up to thanksgiving, do you refuse to come? Of course not. Because thats stupid. But look at how awkward everyone was when trump took the stand. They did not want to be there in that moment.\n\nWe pride ourselves in the US in peaceful transitions of power. Even if the president's party loses the election, they give up the highest office to their rivals. Thats a beautiful thing. When the people speak, the government has to listen and those in charge have to give up their power (if its the will of the people), and they do so peacefully. Yes, Hillary wanted to be president, and she wants trump nowhere near the whitehouse. But, the fact is, trump is going to be the 45th president of the united states. And trying to fight it would be not only be political suicide, it would amount to treason, and it would solve nothing. Obama is throwing himself completely into explaining everything about the presidency, because being bitter and upset won't change the facts. He's putting away all the bad feelings about the election for the good of the people, and thats never a bad thing.\n\nThe only thing i agree with is that campaigns are show. But i'm not sure i agree with the feeling behind what you mean. Trump was never going to arrest Hillary, build a wall, fight corruption, or a myriad of other campaign promises.

So anywho, they lease lab space and equipment and develop the idea and it shows promise. Round 2 of financing comes in, another 50 million at the cost of another 30% stake, they hire 30 more people, lease a larger space and buy more necessary equipment. It's getting to be an expensive company to run and it so far has nothing to sell. It starts to 'burn' money at a rate that means the doors can only stay open for maybe another year. The idea continues to show promise. It works in cells, it works in mice, it works in primates, it's time for clinic. Round 3 of funding comes in with 100 million, and that costs 15% of the remaining stake. Company hires 20 more people, this time mostly bureaucrats to set up a proposal for an 'Investigational New Drug' application. This is what you need to convince the FDA to allow you to start clinical trials on humans. Right now, the original owners retain only 4% of the original stake. \n\nSo, time for clinical trials. Phase 1 begins with 30 healthy adults. This is just to show that the drug is safe. It costs 10 million USD. The company has zero profits so far and has been paying 60 people for years, so it has to pay for this cost by leveraging 3% of the final stake. Eventually, the 'burn' rate means that it has to fire 90% of their scientists as they can't afford salaries anymore. That's OK though, because this startup has succeeded.  You see, Phase 1 clinical trial pass (the drug is safe) and it's onto phase 2 (which asks 'is it effective?). This costs 40 million USD more but no more money is left. What to do? Only one option. The investors who now control 99% of the company decide to sell everything to a company like Novartis/Merck/GSK, etc. The company sells for 500 million USD on the expected promise of the new drug. Original founders walk away with 5 million USD due to having a 1% stake. Everyone else is out on their ass looking for a new startup. This is considered a HUGE success in the startup world. It's what everyone hoped for. \n\nNow, Merck or whoever takes over development of drug X. Drug passes Phase 2 but fails in Phase 3 Trials. \n\nAnd that's how you lose 1 billion USD over 10 years with 100s of cumulative years of human work down the drain. \n\nTHIS is why developing drugs is expensive and THIS is why the drugs that work are expensive. \n\nTo anyone saying that Universities should make drugs instead of industry: There are very, very few universities that could afford this. Harvard maybe. Most universities would spend their entire endowment on a 9 to 1 shot. Universities like bonds for a reason. You don't play roulette with your endowment. This is a job for people willing to risk billions. And this, my friends is why drug development is so centralized in the US. Fucking cowboy investors are the best route forward here. \n\nAnd for those who think this is cynical, please recall that for the actual people who founded this company and for the scientists doing the research, they are most often driven by a desire to cure horrific diseases and change the world. The money aspect is a necessary evil that good people need to navigate. Consider that a typical PhD scientist makes about 1/4 as much as a physician and spends a similar amount of time in education (13 years for me from BS to end of postdoc). The people actually researching new drugs are doing it because they are passionate about human health. Not because they are 'shills'.

If someone has corrections, please reply.\n\nThe drug from Alexion is a monoclonal antibody, and takes a lot of resources to produce. To create them, you take animal cells (mice, rabbits, pigs) and make them express the antibody you choose. To do this, you typically first produce or purchase an immortal cancer cell line - cells that replicate fast and forever. You then take your animal and inject it with your antigen to try to produce an immune response. If you are lucky, you get a response and fuse the cell that produces your antibody with the cancer cell. If you are not lucky you start over.\n\nOkay great. Now we have a cancer cell that produces an antibody (the drug you want to market). It's a living thing. It needs to 'eat' and 'poop' like anything else. To eat, it probably lives in some sort of nutrient-rich serum or bath. You don't have a lot of cells right now to make your drug, but you're producing enough to store some and save them away for later. This is if you are lucky and your cells are strong enough to survive outside an organism. If they can't, you might look at putting the cells back in the animal they came from so that you can collect your antibodies from something the animal produces (saliva, milk - have you ever milked a rabbit? Here's an article about producing human growth hormone in rabbit milk: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22898896) Or you might go back to the drawing board and try with a different animal or cancer cell line.\n\nOnce again these cells are alive, which means they are at risk of infection from viruses, bacteria, molds, poisons, etc. So all of this is happening in a sterile environment. If you want to go into the area to work with them, get on your suit gloves and booties. Getting over a cold? You could all of your research, guess you'll be outside observing.\n\nOkay so you've milked a rabbit or gotten your cells surviving in a bath, and you want to start producing enough to go to trials. Great! You start scaling up your bath in a very specifically designed configuration - if you want to later upgrade the equipment you're using to grow your cells in you might have to go through clinical trials again, get new patents, and otherwise spend a bunch of money. Okay you're not worried right now, we just need to make some product. I get my bath, I dump in my cells, get some movement going so that the cells can always be accessing nutrients instead of sitting in their own poop. Great. Now I go home for the night. 2AM I get a call from my late-night coworker or an alert from my monitoring system. Something's gone wrong. The cells are dying. You can't put this on pause. If enough of the cells die you won't be able to make enough antibody for trials. And if you're at risk for making enough for trials, what happens if you get through trials and can't make enough drugs for your patients? Depends on the drug - it could be anything from having a bad time on the toilet to having their cancer spread. So you get up, you go into work, you get your suit and gloves and booties on and you try to figure out what's gone wrong and how you can prevent this from happening down the line.\n\nHere's an example image of people working with a cell culture reactor (the thing you put the bath in) http://www.novasep.com/cache/media/novasep-cell-culture-300l-bioreactor/r,300,225,1-3bc40c.jpg Everything that goes in and out of these labs is highly controlled, even the air. You have to follow the process for putting on your gloves and suit and booties to make sure you are keeping contamination at a minimum. You need highly skilled work done for the ventilation, the flooring - the walls have to be mold/water-proof. Your workers need to know how to maintain and operate high-tech monitoring equipment. You need to have someone who knows fluid dynamics, so that if the nutrients don't flow right you can adjust the stirring equipment properly (spin too little or in the wrong direction you'll get pockets of still bath and your cells with starve. spin too much and you could tear the cells apart). Your workers have masters and PHDs and expect to be compensated for their expertise. They expect to be compensated additionally if they are on call to keep your product alive.\n\nYou can check out the clinical trial process, but I'm going to skip and assume that we made it through. The drug works! We can sell it! We spin up a manufacturing plant to start meeting demand. We're harvesting the drug. Everything goes well. A year in, there's an outbreak of mold in the ventilation units. Some of the batches need to be dumped (what if a patient has an allergic reaction to something we couldn't process out of our product). That's O.K. we have reserves. A clumsy worker's hair ends up in one of the baths. There's more product you've lost. A virus kills off your batches. Now you're short on drugs, it takes years to spin up a new manufacturing plant and months to clean and restart the new one. Your patients are suffering. The FDA is on your ass about it. News agencies are talking to patients and doctors who might not even fully know what to expect symptom-wise if they can't get supply. \n\nThe company has some money reserved for dealing with P.R. and training workers to prevent worker accidents (like hair falling into the batch.) Dealing with the FDA could be costly if you have to dedicate worker's time to providing reports instead of generating revenue. If you don't spend money and resources to fix the problem in a demonstrable way, there's a potential for the FDA to say \"This is an emergency and we are going to allow X manufacturers to produces this drug.\" And then there's your patients. It's no secret to them that there's a supply issue. They're dying. And they know there's other people just like them dying for the same dumb reason, after they've possibly given this company millions of dollars so they can survive. Now you have a class-action lawsuit on your hands. You have to shell out money for lawyers, take engineering time to put them on the stand and testify.\n\nAnd once all this is done, some people do line their pockets. I'll make no judgement here, each individual should do that for themselves.

Unfortunately, Louis Theroux missed his opportunity to capitalize on them. Instead, they are undercut by the skits, which seem silly. I found myself mentally suggesting to Rathbun that he needs counseling, though I doubt he would get it as an ex-Scientologist. I would be skeptical of it in his position too. A man who is incapable of maintaining friendships because of the constant onslaught of \"squirrel hunting\" that he endures... \n\nThat he probably put into action from L. Ron Hubbard's own writings, against other people who left Scientology.\n\nBy the end of the film, the squirrel hunting seems only one facet of Rathbun's isolation. Rathbun, as the film states, was one of Miscavige's chief enforcers during his tenure in Scientology. He admits his position, even some of his actions (punching people), but uses well-honed Scientology techniques to sidestep deeper questions about his mindset. The confrontation where squirrel hunters suggest Rathbun is getting paid by \"foster care\" was just confusing. Even Rathbun stated the squirrel hunters were misinformed or blathering, but this of all works Rathbun up to a point where he refuses to answer Theroux's questions about his own involvement in the \"attack the attacker\" protocol, saying he's just so offended and he demands an apology. And Theroux just seems at that moment to give up! Which is exactly what Rathbun intended by saying so vociferously how offended he was. Theroux either didn't prepare for the way Scientologists sidestep personal responsibility, or he just didn't want to pursue this line, which is unfortunate because it's the most interesting aspect of the documentary. \n\nThe film should have been a full exploration of Rathbun's experiences, focusing on the probing of Rathbun's personality. What drove him (and others) to embrace Scientology in the first place, what about Hubbard's systematic suppression of criticism appealed to him, Rathbun's full-throated support of Miscavige and the Scientology organization, what led him to leave, and how he reflects on himself now, without Scientology. (Why does he still use the same techniques? Why hasn't he tossed them all out?)

This revealing detective story travels from Vincent's home in the south of France to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, and uncovers key evidence hidden in a Californian library that has created an art-world sensation, as we finally solve the mystery of Van Gogh's ear.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n[^^Bot ^^Info](https://github.com/William-Hicks/YouTubeModerator) ^^| [^^Request ^^A ^^Bot](https://www.reddit.com) ^^| [^^Make ^^A ^^Suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=iNeverQuiteWas) ^^| [^^Report ^^A ^^Problem](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=iNeverQuiteWas)", "id": "daqsq83"}]]], "5fu2bt": ["False Witness- Did Jeffrey MacDonald Brutally murder his family?

She is not technically a blood relative and was adopted by Warrens son. They took her in when they didn't have to. From that perspective, Warren does not owe her anything, her father does. But not anymore as she is an adult. \n\nFrom what I can see, she was more of a freeloader. When you do that, you are essentially a bitch. You do as you are told. If you do not, you are cut. That is what happened here. I think she had a twin sister to but she played by the rules. Nicole wasn't some young naive person. This was her fault. \n\nI think she got her education paid for, had a decent trust fund (not fuck you money but still decent), she decided not to go into business and rather into art and became a painter. Warren approved of her choice. Most rich families don't tolerate that. You get your MBA from a Ivy League and join the business. However she was a failed artist. Warrens wife at the time, Susan (she passed on) essentially bought the majority of her art work and help her eating. \n\nI think Warren and other family members told her to keep quiet and that the family isn't a reality tv show. Nicole then proceeded to do what she was told not to do and got cut. She ended up on Oprah at some point. \n\nFrom biographies Warren comes from a conservative family. His family is rich, I'm sure they do rich people things. But he wanted to keep that life quiet. He isn't some rich playboy. His reputation is what got him where he was. When he talks, people listen and markets move. Just think about that. When you say \"I think SnapChat is going fail\" what happens?  Nothing. When Warren says that, SnapChat will go bankrupt within days. That has responsibility attached to it. \n\nWhen Goldman Sachs (I don't care what people feel about GS) needed a cash infusion, Warren provided it. Just think about that. He bailed out a bank. A company which is supposed to be in the money business needed bailing out. Why? Because he believes in cash and was the only one of few people in the world that has that kind of cash (through businesses). He didn't fall for that leverage stuff that made millionaires into billionaires and back into millionaires. \n\nAnyways, my two cents on this girl.
