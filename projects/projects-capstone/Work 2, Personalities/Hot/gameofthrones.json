Is there something wrong with me? I'm worried now :/"], [9, "I didn't like the execution of those scenes because the depiction of them goes against everything the book series stood for and how the show started. The books heavily criticize the concept of \"Revenge feels Good, Revenge is Right\", perhaps most heavily in the Dornish plotline. Doran Martell desires revenge on the Lannisters for the deaths of his sister Elia and her children Rhaenys and Aegon, but by the time he starts to become active in the main series, the three individuals chiefly responsible for these deaths (Tywin Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Amory Lorch) are all killed by others. Instead it seems likely that he, in his desire to see the Lannisters fall, will side with a faction (Griff and Young Griff) that will inevitably end up clashing with Daenerys once she lands - and that clash will likely end in the deaths of several of his relatives (his oldest son has already died as a direct result of these plans) and loyal lords and subjects, all simply because he wished to take revenge on the Lannisters for something that happened 17 years ago and is rather irrelevant to the currently living Lannisters.\n\nSo if the books goes a similar route to the show, in having the Starks responsible for the downfall of the Freys and Boltons, I am confident that it will not play out as some kind of revenge fantasy where the audience is meant to feel satisfaction and applaud the protagonists, but as a deeply troubling moment that empathizes how far from Ned Stark these children has come (and not in a good way) - yet that was what I felt happened in the show, which is why it rang hollow to me. \n\nJust my two cents regarding those two scenes."], [7, "Arya and Sansa enjoying their revenge makes it hard for you to enjoy their revenge?\n\nJoffrey's killer wasn't on-screen, and Tywin's was a broken, depressed man.  That's supposed to look different."], [7, "I had no issue with either scene and Sansa's reaction to Ramsay's death shows that he did, in fact, affect her just as her not telling Jon about the Knights of the Vale showed how Little Finger has had in impact on her world view. Sansa has gone from a wide eyed girl who wanted nothing more than to live a courtly life to having her life turned upside down and come out of it stronger and colder. "], [6, "I think the show's intention is for there to be some cognitive dissonance. We want the Boltons and the Freys to be punished, and we want the Starks to be the ones who do it, but the show delivers the punishment in an extremely dark manner and has Arya and Sansa enjoying it, arguably too much. Compare Sansa's scene to Jon's scene in executing his murderers. Jon follows Ned's teachings about justice and responsibility; whereas Sansa eschews every lesson in favor of vengeance and torture. Her scene was written, performed, and filmed to parallel Cersei's scene with Septa Unella, down to Sansa walking away smirking while the other person screams in agony. I found it disturbing, and although I would have preferred that Sansa used the opportunity to execute Ramsay publicly as a demonstration of the transfer of power back to House Stark and the reinstitution of fairness and justice, I understand that this is part of her character arc. I don't particularly like it, as I interpret the theme of the futility of vengeance to be something that the younger generation is supposed to moving away from, not towards, but perhaps that is Book Sansa's trajectory.\n\nAs for focusing on Arya and Sansa during these scenes, that is purposeful. We are supposed to wonder about the characters' psychology and the ramifications of these acts. If the scene focused on Walder and Ramsay instead, then the violence would probably come off as gratuitous.\n\nI did not care for the Arya scene because it had no setup, and the producers prioritized a shocking reveal and fan service (Frey pies) over good, organic writing."], [5, "I agree with you to a lesser extent on Ramsey, I was sad to see him go as a villain but knew it was necessary for Jon's, Sansa's and Littelfingers story arc. However it was a nice wrap up i think, Ramsey and his half brother both dies and ends House Bolton in the belly of Ramsey's beloved hounds.\n\nOn Walder Frey I agree 100%, i did not like that scene at all. Arya coming out of nowhere (and much like the showDany is now immune to fire, showArya seems to have unlimited supply of rubber faces) and kills someone she has never met before and takes *huge* satisfaction from it. I would much prefer someone with a more emotional tie to the Red Wedding do the deed, any banner man of House Stark really would do. And to top it off, she used the Frey-Pie card in a to me quite brushed off manner \"you just at your family, have 2 seconds to think about that, now die!\". I think Walder Frey could have made a better small villain in S7, perhaps died ~ep2 by this new White Wolf King coalition now that the North is united under Stark again and the Lannister House have bigger worries than helping out old Frey. "], [3, "No, you see, that's the whole point. Like the rest of GoT it's a deconstruction of traditional fantasy tropes. \n\nOften, revenge isn't sweet, even if served cold. It's just more killing and suffering except the protagonists aren't on the receiving end. There might be a kind of cursory fist-pump \"hell yeah moment\" when Walder or Ramsay or Joffrey bite it, but immediately you realise it doesn't bring back the people they killed or undo the pain they inflicted. So a lot of the time, revenge isn't satisfying in GoT, much like in real life, despite how much we build it up to be an ultimate cathartic experience in other media.\n\nThat's what's so great about this universe - it really is for grown-ups"], [2, "[EVERYTHING] means comments about any event or theory are fine without spoiler tags.

Shit even Jon was beating Ramsays face in brutally until he saw Sansa standing there. It's all about the heat of the moment. "], [2, "Does the fact that Walder Frey ate two of his children in a meat pie before his throat was cut make the revenge any sweeter? As a father myself, I can't even imagine how weird a feeling that would conjure up knowing that the last thought before I died was... \"holy shit, I just ate my child!!!\"\n\nThat is pretty satisfying if you ask me."], [2, "I would argue that there is a lot to be said for the timing of these instances of revenge that the Stark children get.\n\nI don't know if you have ever read the novel \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", but I feel like it is by far the greatest revenge story ever written. And the reason I say that is because (and without spoiling anything), the main protagonist is wronged by three people at the exact moment that his life is reaching it's highest point. Due to this wronging, he is jailed for several years and given the chance to plot his revenge, and escapes to exact it. But he doesn't just go and straight up kill the people who did him wrong; no, he waits until they think their lives are perfect and then takes precisely what they value most (money, family, and reputation) away from them.\n\nI would argue this is what the Stark children are now experiencing. They are taking the opportunity to exact their revenge on their tormenters at the exact moment that they reach this highest points. Walder Frey has just become Lord of Riverlands (a title he has had his eye on his entire life) and Arya makes that the exact moment she sweeps in and takes it all away from him. Ramsey Bolton has been a bastard his whole life, was just given the Bolton name, killed his father, and became the Lord of Winterfell when Sansa plots (in secret) his downfall and ends up killing him in a manner that takes away the thing that he values most...control and the ability to manipulate the situation.\n\nSo I say, start looking for the Stark children to continue this trend. George RR Martin loves things to come in threes (Cersei's prophecy about her three children, Daenerys' prophesy that her heart will be broken three times, three blood riders for the Khals, etc). So think about who is coming up on their highest point in life. Cersei is Queen now? Jaime is finally alone with only his sister? Perhaps this signals that one or more of the Stark children is going to kill Cersei...thereby destroying her when her life hits it's highest point and taking everything from her when she finally has control."], [1, "I didn't like the way this event happened DAE actors and showrunners talentless hacks"], [1, "I thought It was poor having arya kill walder and ramsay kill roose. "], [1, "\"Arya\" looked sadistic for a reason. It was not Arya. I know those continue to say \"oh the tinfoil\" but it's not if you let go of precious Arya. In season 6 the episode The Door subtlety (not well enough it seems) how Arya will never become them and they only want her FACE as a GIFT. The viewer should recall Arya being beaten for two seasons now on her own past. Who is this person? What did you do with them? How do you feel about them? Etc etc. Anytime she lied she was smacked. Not for her gain.. because the waif who needed this information needed ALL of the correct information and not lies. \n\nIn the episode we see Arya and the waif battling with sticks and Arya knocked down. The waif then says \"you will never be one of us\" in to which Jaqen appears and says \"a girl has a point\". Next scene shows Arya walking with Jaqen and he goes on to tell the history of the faceless men saying none were ever born from Lords or ladies and that they were offered a GIFT..a FACE. He then proceeds to give Arya her task in killing lady Crane and says either way a face will be added to the hall. \n\nWhen Arya asks Jaqen why lady Crane and that she seems nice Jaqen responds with \"does death only come for the wicked?\" Arya says no and the scene ends. \n\nWe then see Arya purposely fail at her target lady Crane. Next scene is the waif and Jaqen (carving a face off just so viewers can connect the waif knows this technical part of how to do so) and he tells her (the waif) she can go through with her target. \n\nOnce the waif stabs Arya and we see her in the home of lady Crane does the waifs true journey begin. We see the waif kill lady Crane, essentially taking out the initial intended target (remember a debt was paid whether it be to someone undeserving or not)as well as chase after Arya in \"terminator\" mode with the same sadistic stare OP mentions. In Fact we've come quite accustomed to that sadistic smirk and stare that when you see it acted out through another actress most miss it. \n\nFinal scene shows \"Arya\" giving her famous lines of \"a girl is Arya stark\" with Jaqen giving his approval that she is now no one and then her walking off not with injury but same stride and upright pose as the waif. \n\nWe then finally get to see \"Arya\" kill Walder and show the same sadistic smile to imply it's the waif.  Arya on her deathbed of lady Crane never mentioned going home or having unfinished business. In fact it was the opposite. Writers even tried to show the viewer she was more concerned with what was west of westeros. Not revenge.  Walder Frey was killed by the faceless men who have a bigger play in the works. \n\nMost telling this is most likely correct.

(Sansa couldn't enjoy Joffrey death as much as she would have wanted). And remember she is not supposed to have relation with the Boltons.\n\nArya go for similar issue. She's an assassin, assassins are the ones that go for a silent and quick death.\nBut what does Arya do? She goes for all this problems and take all this time just for take someone out. Stab someone in the face multiple times and left him bleed, kill all the Frey kids and put them into a cake and make Walder eat it. \n\nD&D only care more about what's more *awesome* and *jaw-dropping* to the audience that caring about the characters and their characterization."]], [[{"comment": "Time has changed the Stark Children.

The books heavily criticize the concept of \"Revenge feels Good, Revenge is Right\", perhaps most heavily in the Dornish plotline. Doran Martell desires revenge on the Lannisters for the deaths of his sister Elia and her children Rhaenys and Aegon, but by the time he starts to become active in the main series, the three individuals chiefly responsible for these deaths (Tywin Lannister, Gregor Clegane, Amory Lorch) are all killed by others. Instead it seems likely that he, in his desire to see the Lannisters fall, will side with a faction (Griff and Young Griff) that will inevitably end up clashing with Daenerys once she lands - and that clash will likely end in the deaths of several of his relatives (his oldest son has already died as a direct result of these plans) and loyal lords and subjects, all simply because he wished to take revenge on the Lannisters for something that happened 17 years ago and is rather irrelevant to the currently living Lannisters.\n\nSo if the books goes a similar route to the show, in having the Starks responsible for the downfall of the Freys and Boltons, I am confident that it will not play out as some kind of revenge fantasy where the audience is meant to feel satisfaction and applaud the protagonists, but as a deeply troubling moment that empathizes how far from Ned Stark these children has come (and not in a good way) - yet that was what I felt happened in the show, which is why it rang hollow to me. \n\nJust my two cents regarding those two scenes.", "id": "dadp57q"}], [{"comment": "Arya and Sansa enjoying their revenge makes it hard for you to enjoy their revenge?\n\nJoffrey's killer wasn't on-screen, and Tywin's was a broken, depressed man.

We want the Boltons and the Freys to be punished, and we want the Starks to be the ones who do it, but the show delivers the punishment in an extremely dark manner and has Arya and Sansa enjoying it, arguably too much. Compare Sansa's scene to Jon's scene in executing his murderers. Jon follows Ned's teachings about justice and responsibility; whereas Sansa eschews every lesson in favor of vengeance and torture. Her scene was written, performed, and filmed to parallel Cersei's scene with Septa Unella, down to Sansa walking away smirking while the other person screams in agony. I found it disturbing, and although I would have preferred that Sansa used the opportunity to execute Ramsay publicly as a demonstration of the transfer of power back to House Stark and the reinstitution of fairness and justice, I understand that this is part of her character arc. I don't particularly like it, as I interpret the theme of the futility of vengeance to be something that the younger generation is supposed to moving away from, not towards, but perhaps that is Book Sansa's trajectory.\n\nAs for focusing on Arya and Sansa during these scenes, that is purposeful. We are supposed to wonder about the characters' psychology and the ramifications of these acts. If the scene focused on Walder and Ramsay instead, then the violence would probably come off as gratuitous.\n\nI did not care for the Arya scene because it had no setup, and the producers prioritized a shocking reveal and fan service (Frey pies) over good, organic writing.", "id": "daefedd"}], [{"comment": "I agree with you to a lesser extent on Ramsey, I was sad to see him go as a villain but knew it was necessary for Jon's, Sansa's and Littelfingers story arc.

And the reason I say that is because (and without spoiling anything), the main protagonist is wronged by three people at the exact moment that his life is reaching it's highest point. Due to this wronging, he is jailed for several years and given the chance to plot his revenge, and escapes to exact it. But he doesn't just go and straight up kill the people who did him wrong; no, he waits until they think their lives are perfect and then takes precisely what they value most (money, family, and reputation) away from them.\n\nI would argue this is what the Stark children are now experiencing. They are taking the opportunity to exact their revenge on their tormenters at the exact moment that they reach this highest points. Walder Frey has just become Lord of Riverlands (a title he has had his eye on his entire life) and Arya makes that the exact moment she sweeps in and takes it all away from him. Ramsey Bolton has been a bastard his whole life, was just given the Bolton name, killed his father, and became the Lord of Winterfell when Sansa plots (in secret) his downfall and ends up killing him in a manner that takes away the thing that he values most...control and the ability to manipulate the situation.\n\nSo I say, start looking for the Stark children to continue this trend. George RR Martin loves things to come in threes (Cersei's prophecy about her three children, Daenerys' prophesy that her heart will be broken three times, three blood riders for the Khals, etc). So think about who is coming up on their highest point in life. Cersei is Queen now? Jaime is finally alone with only his sister? Perhaps this signals that one or more of the Stark children is going to kill Cersei...thereby destroying her when her life hits it's highest point and taking everything from her when she finally has control.", "id": "daeh5fu"}, {"comment": "Starks can't kill Cersei, the valonqar has to.

For example, Bran was the \"little brother\" of Robb Stark, who was wronged by Cersei's family.  Jon Snow was a \"brother\" of the Night's Watch. Perhaps it could even be the Hound, the \"little brother\" of her primary protector (the Mountain). \n\nNow don't get me wrong, all signs do point pretty much directly to Tyrion being the one that kills her. He is her \"little brother\" in almost every sense of the term. And he has vowed to see her ruined before he dies.

I know those continue to say \"oh the tinfoil\" but it's not if you let go of precious Arya.

The viewer should recall Arya being beaten for two seasons now on her own past. Who is this person? What did you do with them? How do you feel about them? Etc etc. Anytime she lied she was smacked. Not for her gain.. because the waif who needed this information needed ALL of the correct information and not lies. \n\nIn the episode we see Arya and the waif battling with sticks and Arya knocked down. The waif then says \"you will never be one of us\" in to which Jaqen appears and says \"a girl has a point\". Next scene shows Arya walking with Jaqen and he goes on to tell the history of the faceless men saying none were ever born from Lords or ladies and that they were offered a GIFT..a FACE. He then proceeds to give Arya her task in killing lady Crane and says either way a face will be added to the hall. \n\nWhen Arya asks Jaqen why lady Crane and that she seems nice Jaqen responds with \"does death only come for the wicked?\" Arya says no and the scene ends. \n\nWe then see Arya purposely fail at her target lady Crane. Next scene is the waif and Jaqen (carving a face off just so viewers can connect the waif knows this technical part of how to do so) and he tells her (the waif) she can go through with her target. \n\nOnce the waif stabs Arya and we see her in the home of lady Crane does the waifs true journey begin. We see the waif kill lady Crane, essentially taking out the initial intended target (remember a debt was paid whether it be to someone undeserving or not)as well as chase after Arya in \"terminator\" mode with the same sadistic stare OP mentions. In Fact we've come quite accustomed to that sadistic smirk and stare that when you see it acted out through another actress most miss it. \n\nFinal scene shows \"Arya\" giving her famous lines of \"a girl is Arya stark\" with Jaqen giving his approval that she is now no one and then her walking off not with injury but same stride and upright pose as the waif. \n\nWe then finally get to see \"Arya\" kill Walder and show the same sadistic smile to imply it's the waif.  Arya on her deathbed of lady Crane never mentioned going home or having unfinished business. In fact it was the opposite. Writers even tried to show the viewer she was more concerned with what was west of westeros. Not revenge.  Walder Frey was killed by the faceless men who have a bigger play in the works. \n\nMost telling this is most likely correct.

"], [12, "The show strategy for Jon was horrendous though.And it was obvious by the layout that it would never happen.The smartest thing would of been to use Guerrilla war tactics,or if they were absolutely going to have 1 single battle then they should of incorporated the frozen lake trick from the books."], [7, "He was fucked as soon as he left the gates due to the Vale showing up."], [9, "I've [previously](http://imgur.com/a/1iOMi) given my analysis of the battle and the reasons why it had to happen and why both sides had terrible strategies. What I never got around to was a suggestion for an alternative strategy that could have been used. I'm planning on doing so in detail in the near future, so here's a summary of what I think Jon should have done.\n\n1) Jon should have pushed his lines forward so that his archers were on top of the two rises and his infantry in the gap between them. This not only allows his archers to see the enemy, but gives them a range advantage, which they'll likely need due to how many of them have non-military bows. \n\n2) in front and to the sides of his position, Jon should have erected some kind of barricade. Perhaps this would take the form of a series of stakes or, if the ground was too hard, perhaps three of those stakes lashed together to form a barricade. If possible, hidden trenches or potholes forward of the barricade.\n\n3) the men in the front of his ranks should have large wicker shields covered in leather, layers of linen or rawhide in order to protect them from Ramsay's arrows. The soldiers behind should have been armed with long stakes, preferably pikes.\n\n4) Jon's cavalry and Wun Wun (who has a club) should have been in the woods on either side of his position, ready to spring an ambush. Reading through both medieval and 19th century accounts, it becomes clear that surprise charges routinely rout much larger forces, if only temporarily.\n\n**How the battle plays out**\n\nDue to his defences, Jon never manages to charge out to save Rickon. Davos and Sansa have time to catch him and bring him back into line, but only after Jon nearly kills Davos and threatens his men in an attempt to get through them more quickly. Ramsay is disappointed and kills Rickon in front of the whole army.\n\nImpatient, Ramsey sends his cavalry in next, but they're brought up short by Jon's defences and begin to lose men and horses to his archers. At a signal from Davos, Jon still being worked up, a hundred and fifty cavalry riding knee to knee come from the right and fifty cavalry and Wun Wun come in close formation from the right. The Bolton cavalry, disorganised because of their failed charge and the large number of them compared to Jon's force and having formed a roiling sea of men and horses, are unable to react in time and, after the first shock, rout. They're brought back under control eventually, but Ramsay sends his archers and infantry into battle out of disgust.\n\nThe archers advance forward of the Bolton heavy infantry. Smalljon and Lord Karstark have yet to be seen, and Ramsay gives a little smirk.\n\nRamsay's archers enter into a duel with Jon's and take a disproportionate number of casualties due to Jon's use of shields and the elevation of his archers. They do, however, cause a large number of casualties on Jon's side before they retreat and the pikemen advance.\n\nUnder cover of a line of brave shield bearers and a few archers, the ditch is filled with corpses and the infantry advances, the shield bearers tearing down the barricades and begining to engage with Jon's pikemen, who are not particularly good.\n\nA Wildling suddenly runs up to Jon and tells him that there are enemies behind him. Jon manages to form the dismounted cavalry, who rejoined him after their charge, into a defensive line just before Lord Karstark and Smalljon bring their light infantry into play, attacking from the woods. Jon finds himself pressed from front and rear and his situation appears hopeless. He realises that he can't see Sansa and panics.\n\nA sound like thunder has been in the background for a while now, but it's only just now fully audible to us and to Jon, who gets clear of the battle line and looks towards where the Bolton cavalry should be, irrationally fearing a charge. Instead, he is in time to see the Knights of the Vale hit Ramsay's barely formed cavalry, lances lowered. Another detachment of Littlefinger's cavalry comes into view around the rise to Jon's left and, trumpets sounding, hit Ramsay's heavy infantry in the rear. The infantry has tried to reform to meet the charge, but are unable to fully meet it, and the KotV have peytrals, which largely protect their horses. The Bolton heavy infantry rout from their left, free up Jon's remaining infantry to focus on Smalljon and Karstark.\n\nJon, meanwhile, mounts one of the few surviving horses, with a combination of archers and men at arms and has Wun Wun clear a path for them. Someone hands him Stark banner and he charges towards Winterfell, Wun Wun in the lead.\n\nNow, through all this, Wun Wun has had a massive shield on his back, made from split saplings and covered in leather or rawhide. He unslings it now as he charges Winterfell. It stops the first springald bolt, which penetrates a foot. The second nearly penetrates all the way through and the third actually manages to injure Wun Wun. The Bolton archers are shooting at him now. The fourth and final bolt pins Wun Wun's shield to his body, but in one last effort he shoulder charges the gate, which breaks open, and stumbles into the courtyard beyond, still being shot at by archers.\n\nThings then proceed much the same as they did in the show, only with a small but reasonable sized group of archers and men at arms following Jon into Winterfell, followed by a large group of KotV, lead by Sansa and Littlefinger.\n\nBoth Ramsay and Jon are thus competent generals, both make mistakes true to their character, and a minimal suspension of disbelief is required."], [4, "Step 1. Give Wun-Wun a bow and have him shoot from outside of the range of the defending archers. \n\nStep 2. ???\n\nStep 3. Profit!

For the life of me, I cannot understand how everyone forgot the Stark army had a giant... Jon, Tormund and every wildling there saw Mance use Giants with huge bows and wooly mammoths!\n\nThey should've been building defensive/offensive weaponry for a Giant the moment he walked through the doors at Castle Black. \n\nJon and his army could've attacked at night instead of waiting for the morning. With a broad shield of sorts, a giant could approach the gates of Winterfell at night and bust the door down. Even if you fought in the morning, in an open field the Giant could be launching bolts all the way across the battle field to force the Boltons to charge."], [2, "I suppose in theory holding back, letting Jon die and allowing Ramsay to chase them down would have led to likely less overall casualties since Sansa and the Vale still would've been able to surprise them.

What I never got around to was a suggestion for an alternative strategy that could have been used. I'm planning on doing so in detail in the near future, so here's a summary of what I think Jon should have done.\n\n1) Jon should have pushed his lines forward so that his archers were on top of the two rises and his infantry in the gap between them. This not only allows his archers to see the enemy, but gives them a range advantage, which they'll likely need due to how many of them have non-military bows. \n\n2) in front and to the sides of his position, Jon should have erected some kind of barricade. Perhaps this would take the form of a series of stakes or, if the ground was too hard, perhaps three of those stakes lashed together to form a barricade. If possible, hidden trenches or potholes forward of the barricade.\n\n3) the men in the front of his ranks should have large wicker shields covered in leather, layers of linen or rawhide in order to protect them from Ramsay's arrows. The soldiers behind should have been armed with long stakes, preferably pikes.\n\n4) Jon's cavalry and Wun Wun (who has a club) should have been in the woods on either side of his position, ready to spring an ambush. Reading through both medieval and 19th century accounts, it becomes clear that surprise charges routinely rout much larger forces, if only temporarily.\n\n**How the battle plays out**\n\nDue to his defences, Jon never manages to charge out to save Rickon. Davos and Sansa have time to catch him and bring him back into line, but only after Jon nearly kills Davos and threatens his men in an attempt to get through them more quickly. Ramsay is disappointed and kills Rickon in front of the whole army.\n\nImpatient, Ramsey sends his cavalry in next, but they're brought up short by Jon's defences and begin to lose men and horses to his archers. At a signal from Davos, Jon still being worked up, a hundred and fifty cavalry riding knee to knee come from the right and fifty cavalry and Wun Wun come in close formation from the right. The Bolton cavalry, disorganised because of their failed charge and the large number of them compared to Jon's force and having formed a roiling sea of men and horses, are unable to react in time and, after the first shock, rout. They're brought back under control eventually, but Ramsay sends his archers and infantry into battle out of disgust.\n\nThe archers advance forward of the Bolton heavy infantry. Smalljon and Lord Karstark have yet to be seen, and Ramsay gives a little smirk.\n\nRamsay's archers enter into a duel with Jon's and take a disproportionate number of casualties due to Jon's use of shields and the elevation of his archers. They do, however, cause a large number of casualties on Jon's side before they retreat and the pikemen advance.\n\nUnder cover of a line of brave shield bearers and a few archers, the ditch is filled with corpses and the infantry advances, the shield bearers tearing down the barricades and begining to engage with Jon's pikemen, who are not particularly good.\n\nA Wildling suddenly runs up to Jon and tells him that there are enemies behind him. Jon manages to form the dismounted cavalry, who rejoined him after their charge, into a defensive line just before Lord Karstark and Smalljon bring their light infantry into play, attacking from the woods. Jon finds himself pressed from front and rear and his situation appears hopeless. He realises that he can't see Sansa and panics.\n\nA sound like thunder has been in the background for a while now, but it's only just now fully audible to us and to Jon, who gets clear of the battle line and looks towards where the Bolton cavalry should be, irrationally fearing a charge. Instead, he is in time to see the Knights of the Vale hit Ramsay's barely formed cavalry, lances lowered. Another detachment of Littlefinger's cavalry comes into view around the rise to Jon's left and, trumpets sounding, hit Ramsay's heavy infantry in the rear. The infantry has tried to reform to meet the charge, but are unable to fully meet it, and the KotV have peytrals, which largely protect their horses. The Bolton heavy infantry rout from their left, free up Jon's remaining infantry to focus on Smalljon and Karstark.\n\nJon, meanwhile, mounts one of the few surviving horses, with a combination of archers and men at arms and has Wun Wun clear a path for them. Someone hands him Stark banner and he charges towards Winterfell, Wun Wun in the lead.\n\nNow, through all this, Wun Wun has had a massive shield on his back, made from split saplings and covered in leather or rawhide. He unslings it now as he charges Winterfell. It stops the first springald bolt, which penetrates a foot. The second nearly penetrates all the way through and the third actually manages to injure Wun Wun. The Bolton archers are shooting at him now. The fourth and final bolt pins Wun Wun's shield to his body, but in one last effort he shoulder charges the gate, which breaks open, and stumbles into the courtyard beyond, still being shot at by archers.\n\nThings then proceed much the same as they did in the show, only with a small but reasonable sized group of archers and men at arms following Jon into Winterfell, followed by a large group of KotV, lead by Sansa and Littlefinger.\n\nBoth Ramsay and Jon are thus competent generals, both make mistakes true to their character, and a minimal suspension of disbelief is required.", "id": "dajejta"}], [{"comment": "Step 1.

", "id": "dam1atp"}, {"comment": "Certainly. \n\nIn the books, not only is Tyrion a dwarf but he is quite deformed - he has a stunted leg, a large brow, his nose was cleaved off in the Battle of Blackwater Bay and he is an all-around unpleasant-looking man. \n\nAs we know, Tyrion has always wanted to find true love, he wanted a woman to genuinely love him. In the show, he gets that, and he forces himself to send her off because he has a duty to fulfill for his family, and Shae is a liability. We know how that story ends, and the depression Tyrion accrues as a result. His alliance with Danaerys has given him purpose and meaning once again. Like I said, Tyrion is still a complicated character in the show.\n\nIn the books however, things are much worse, and thus have a greater impact on Tyrion. Shae does not love him, though she acted like she did Tyrion, being the cynic he is, kept reminding himself that she always wanted his money. But he fell in love with her anyway. She sold him out in the trial, just like she did in the show, and he still finds her in Tywin's bed. \n\nUnlike the show, where Tyrion kills her after she tries to pull a knife on him, in the books Tyrion outright strangles her in anger and grief, even while she begs for her life. Honestly, in the show it would have been jarring for Tyrion to do this to a woman he did genuinely love, as opposed to what happened in the books. Context is everything, after all. \n\nAnd not only that, but before parting ways Jaime tells Tyrion the truth: the girl Tyrion married years ago, who his father had him believing was just a whore out looking for his money and was set up by Jaime, that was a lie; the girl really was almost raped, she did really love Tyrion, and Tywin actually had all of his guards and then Tyrion rape her to teach him a lesson. This is what makes Tyrion seek out Tywin in the books, whereas in the show he sought Tywin of his own volition. \n\nIn a sense, it was kind of a trade: the show omitted this tragic reveal, but made Tyrion seek Tywin on his own anger and betrayal. Seeing Shae sealed the deal.\n\nAfter this, throughout ADWD Tyrion is depressed and vile. He drinks himself into a coma as soon as he arrives to Pentos and makes bedslaves and whores he sees in his travels service him until he passes out. He assaults his own senses. His only thing driving him, and I'm not kidding, is when he finds Danaerys he vows to do anything she asks of him, even to serve as her footrest. \n\nAll he wants when they conquer Westeros is the honor of raping Cersei before murdering her.

She wishes for a family, \"a house with the red door\" most of all. The whole point of pursuing the Iron Throne is because of how she owes it to her family. It comes with a self doubt on her part and this is lacking on the show \"If I look, Iam lost.\" She's doing epic stuff and rarely shows vulnerability. Jorah scenes and her dragons are the only examples where she showed her true bookDany, emotions. Emilia is perfect in those scenes but it's with how she been written on the show. Show is missing key factors in Dany's character.\n\nWith Jon. Being dumb to plain and simple soldier. Weiss and Benioff said as much in commentary to one of those episodes. Jon in the books is actually a smart lad, not acting out of emotions too often, skilled at planning (helped Stannis with his campaign), show where to start as Deepwood Motte  and to whom he should go to. Showed a bit of skill negotiating Loan from Iron Bank and mainting the Wall, repairing it and manning it with the wildlings. For many people boring stuff, but this what Kings do. Dany is at this further, as she managed Meereen and day to day basis. On the show he's a very good swordsman (average in the books as Mance or Rattleshirt bested him) but that's about it.

Maybe that was intentional, especially since she's been under Little's finger and had to mind her Ps and Qs, but I just have a hard time thinking of her as a Stark anymore, or even knowing where she morally stands. The other kids, like Bran, Rickon even, Jon especially, Arya like whoa, you get who they are and they share a common bottom character line. But Sansa...she's a blob, she has no shape.

Off the top of my head, I can think of two (Hold the door and a scene with the Wildings that I don't remember all of). \n\nTo go further into OP's original post (OP's OP), Bran not having legs isn't what made him go back in time and get marked. It was just Bran doing Bran things, right? So if Bran would've still made it the 3ER without Jamie pushing him out the window, then Bran would've still done what he did to get marked by the White Walker. But Hodor saved them while they were escaping. So if it wasn't for Hodor, Bran would've likely been killed at the 3ER's cave while trying to escape.\n\nQuick TL;DR Bran needed Hodor and he wouldn't have had Hodor without being pushed out the window by Jamie.\n\nUnless I'm misinterpreting what OP is talking about, it kind of makes perfect sense as to why it was necessary for Jamie to push Bran.", "id": "daq4izs"}, {"comment": "Because a timeline is a chain reaction, a certain point in a timeline (among countless alternative futures) can only be reached if everything develops in a certain way; if you change a single event or choice, the butterfly effect occurs.\n\nBran was crippled by Jaime-->Ned Stark had to leave Bran in Winterfell; Bran would go with his father to KL otherwise-->Ned and Catelyn Stark started questioning the event and this, combined with other factors, led to war-->Bran had to flee from Winterfell because Theon used the situation to seize WF-->On his way to Castle Black he met Reeds, learned things from Jojen and decided to go beyond the wall instead of Castle Black-->Jojen and Hodor died and saved Bran...\n\nIf Bran wasn't crippled he wouldn't stay in WF, Ned and Catelyn wouldn't be so eager to reveal the truth about Lannisters, possibly Ned wouldn't even be beheaded, Bran wouldn't have any reason to go to wall (or any desire to go to 3ER), he wouldn't meet Reeds on the way, he wouldn't be convinced to go beyond the wall to find 3ER, Jojen and Hodor wouldn't be there to save him etc.\n\nIf Bran didn't fall, it is impossible that everything else following that event would happen exactly in the same way and at the same time. Uncrippled Bran's path would lead to somewhere entirely else. Who knows what would happen if he wasn't crippled and just went to KL with his father and siblings? Probably there wouldn't even be a war then (but the world would be destroyed by WW a couple of years later). Or even if some of other events still happened, Bran would most likely die in another scenario. It would be a completely different story.\n\nThis is the story that leads to Bran becoming 3ER; and this timeline was probably engineered by old 3ER and also by future Bran, because it leads to Bran playing a major role to save the world. So actually if Jaime didn't push Bran out of the window, the war against the night king and WW would be lost.

I also believe the episode the door has all the answers but I come up with a different ending. \"Arya\" looked sadistic for a reason. It was not Arya. I know those continue to say \"oh the tinfoil\" but it's not if you let go of precious Arya. In season 6 the episode The Door subtlety (not well enough it seems) how Arya will never become them and they only want her FACE as a GIFT. The viewer should recall Arya being beaten for two seasons now on her own past. Who is this person? What did you do with them? How do you feel about them? Etc etc. Anytime she lied she was smacked. Not for her gain.. because the waif who needed this information needed ALL of the correct information and not lies. \n\nIn the episode we see Arya and the waif battling with sticks and Arya knocked down. The waif then says \"you will never be one of us\" in to which Jaqen appears and says \"a girl has a point\". Next scene shows Arya walking with Jaqen and he goes on to tell the history of the faceless men saying none were ever born from Lords or ladies and that they were offered a GIFT..a FACE. He then proceeds to give Arya her task in killing lady Crane and says either way a face will be added to the hall. \n\nWhen Arya asks Jaqen why lady Crane and that she seems nice Jaqen responds with \"does death only come for the wicked?\" Arya says no and the scene ends. \n\nWe then see Arya purposely fail at her target lady Crane. Next scene is the waif and Jaqen (carving a face off just so viewers can connect the waif knows this technical part of how to do so) and he tells her (the waif) she can go through with her target. \n\nOnce the waif stabs Arya and we see her in the home of lady Crane does the waifs true journey begin. We see the waif kill lady Crane, essentially taking out the initial intended target (remember a debt was paid whether it be to someone undeserving or not)as well as chase after Arya in \"terminator\" mode with the same sadistic stare. In Fact we've come quite accustomed to that sadistic smirk and stare that when you see it acted out through another actress most miss it. \n\nFinal scene shows \"Arya\" giving her famous lines of \"a girl is Arya stark\" with Jaqen giving his approval that she is now no one and then her walking off not with injury but same stride and upright pose as the waif. \n\nWe then finally get to see \"Arya\" kill Walder and show the same sadistic smile to imply it's the waif.  Arya on her deathbed of lady Crane never mentioned going home or having unfinished business. In fact it was the opposite. Writers even tried to show the viewer she was more concerned with what was west of westeros. Not revenge.  Walder Frey was killed by the faceless men who have a bigger play in the works. \n\nMost telling this is most likely correct.

I could go on for days bitching about the King's Moot, Jon Snow being declared \"King of the North\" after deserting the Night's Watch, Dany's rushed rise to power amongst the Dothraki, the horrible plodding filler scenes with Tyrion and Myssandei/Greyworm, the chronological dysphoria the show seems to suffer from (where it takes Sam and Gilly months to reach Horn Hill, but Arya somehow gets back to the Twins from Braavos in a matter of days). \n\nBut I won't.

I also believe the episode the door has all the answers but I come up with a different ending. \"Arya\" looked sadistic for a reason. It was not Arya. I know those continue to say \"oh the tinfoil\" but it's not if you let go of precious Arya. In season 6 the episode The Door subtlety (not well enough it seems) how Arya will never become them and they only want her FACE as a GIFT. The viewer should recall Arya being beaten for two seasons now on her own past. Who is this person? What did you do with them? How do you feel about them? Etc etc. Anytime she lied she was smacked. Not for her gain.. because the waif who needed this information needed ALL of the correct information and not lies. \n\nIn the episode we see Arya and the waif battling with sticks and Arya knocked down. The waif then says \"you will never be one of us\" in to which Jaqen appears and says \"a girl has a point\". Next scene shows Arya walking with Jaqen and he goes on to tell the history of the faceless men saying none were ever born from Lords or ladies and that they were offered a GIFT..a FACE. He then proceeds to give Arya her task in killing lady Crane and says either way a face will be added to the hall. \n\nWhen Arya asks Jaqen why lady Crane and that she seems nice Jaqen responds with \"does death only come for the wicked?\" Arya says no and the scene ends. \n\nWe then see Arya purposely fail at her target lady Crane. Next scene is the waif and Jaqen (carving a face off just so viewers can connect the waif knows this technical part of how to do so) and he tells her (the waif) she can go through with her target. \n\nOnce the waif stabs Arya and we see her in the home of lady Crane does the waifs true journey begin. We see the waif kill lady Crane, essentially taking out the initial intended target (remember a debt was paid whether it be to someone undeserving or not)as well as chase after Arya in \"terminator\" mode with the same sadistic stare. In Fact we've come quite accustomed to that sadistic smirk and stare that when you see it acted out through another actress most miss it. \n\nFinal scene shows \"Arya\" giving her famous lines of \"a girl is Arya stark\" with Jaqen giving his approval that she is now no one and then her walking off not with injury but same stride and upright pose as the waif. \n\nWe then finally get to see \"Arya\" kill Walder and show the same sadistic smile to imply it's the waif.  Arya on her deathbed of lady Crane never mentioned going home or having unfinished business. In fact it was the opposite. Writers even tried to show the viewer she was more concerned with what was west of westeros. Not revenge.  Walder Frey was killed by the faceless men who have a bigger play in the works. \n\nMost telling this is most likely correct. Maisie wrote that when she received her scripts for season 7 that she had to go and reread her story in season 6 due to a MAJOR character twist. Hmmm? Its all there. Whether the die hard fans choose to believe it or not\n\n", "id": "dah4szm"}, {"comment": "While this would be a fun twist, IMO it would be a twist for the sake of a twist more in lines with The Walking Dead rather than GoT. At this point, it would be terrible writing.\n\nFirst, why would the Faceless Men care about Arya's list? If they are just using her for a face, they would have their own agenda. Stealing Arya's face to commit murders she wanted to complete makes absolutely no sense. If they wanted to appear to be Arya for credibility and sell fake Arya off as Arya, I'm sure most people that would recognize her wouldn't know this side of her. Nor would they be aware of the list.\n\nAlso, why bother with \"The last thing I want you to see is a Stark smiling over your dying body\" or whatever she said to Walder before she killed him? If it was a faceless man trying to make it look like Arya was doing the killing, they'd have just killed him and put up a wolf sigil in blood. Nobody else heard that but Walder. The only thing that line would accomplish is attempting to con the viewers. Having Walder believe a Stark killed him for 4 seconds means nothing. A real faceless man would have simply said \"The Starks send their regards\" or killed him without saying a word. \n\nNow if they wanted Arya's face to get to close to Jon, Sansa, or someone else, killing Walder as \"Arya\" makes no sense at all except to trick us viewers.

I just don't see it happening because yes, it would be a huuuuge shock, but it would also make most every scene featuring Arya for the past two seasons much, much less impactful.\n\nAlso, your theory that Arya wasn't even thinking of going back to Westeros and/or wanting revenge is simply wrong. Arya's entire being is about revenge. The entire house of black and white storyline drives the point home time and time again that she can't let go of her past and desire for revenge..have you completely forgotten Arya's list?

You didn't even mention Ramsey killing Roose so easily (it was only done to set-up Bastardbowl, which is like a wrestlemania event for the show). \n\nI love hype like everyone else, but when it compromises reason and good story-telling, it begins to bother me. Roose was always depicted as intelligent and pragmatic, no way would he let his guard down with Ramsey, no matter the amount of hubris he was feeling. Jon's resurrection was also handled poorly, they never pointed out whether Sansa even found out. Resurrection is meant to be a huge deal in this world (only the wildlings have really seen all the crazy shit), the rest of the northerners should not accept it so easily. It almost felt like Fan-service in the final episode when he was named the king in the north. It didn't have close to the impact that Robb's coronation did. \n\nThe way it played out for Robb was also so bittersweet because you knew the risk involved and how historic the moment was. Arya's storyline, the dothraki thing with Dany was just a complete shit-show too. I still love the show, but I am really disappointed how season 5 and 6 turned out. I was hyping this show and saying it will stand the test of time, being put forth as an epic masterpiece, but not anymore. Just too much lazy writing, characters doing things to service the plot that goes against their beliefs and motivations, cringe-worthy dialogue (especially from sandsnakes, Missandei and Greyworm, even Tyrion and Varys didn't have the same chemistry in season 6).

As much as he probably also cares for Jon, Luwin is realistic, and that is not where his priorities lie anyway.\n\nInterestingly though, before Ned and Jon part ways.

If Darry still smuggles Dany and Viserys away after hearing how Robert spared Rhaegar's bastard, Robert would probably not view Stannis capture of Dragonstone as a failure because he wouldn't be consumed with the intense hatred and desire to kill all dragonspawn.

For one, Stannis would have much greater influence as a non-estranged brother to the King and a Lord Paramount himself and may help to counteract the Lannisters and other shady people (like Varys or Littlefinger later) getting such power over the kingdom. He'd also be able to help out Jon Arryn more, and tell the Hand when he wasn't guiding his foster son well. Stannis would basically become a surrogate father to Renly (who was like 6-7 at that point) who I think would grow up to respect Stannis as a strong Lord Paramount who withstood an impossible siege. Also, Stannis would probably have a better wife too.\n\nLots of different things could end up happening that I think would make Robert a better king, as he would let go of his dragon hatred.

Varys seems to genuinely mean it when he says he just serves the realm.  \n\nHowever, I'm a little nervous about all the good intentions of Daenerys and the people around her, including Varys.  Unlike Tyrion, whose goal when in power was to just hold everything together so that the fewest people had to die, Varys has been a visionary since we saw him meeting with Illyrio in season 1.  Visionaries who are convinced they're doing the right thing are often history's biggest monsters. People like Robespierre, Mao, and Hitler were willing to accept massive death tolls because they were convinced that, once their visions were enacted, the good would outweigh the bad.  \n\nWe've already seen Daenerys make a knee-jerk call for genocide when the masters attacked Meereen, because she was convinced that they were all pure evil.  Without the moderating influence of Tyrion, she would be nearly as big a threat to the people of Westeros as the White Walkers.

Varys said that he's seen what desire has done to people and how \"the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things...\". When Oberyn asks what other things, Varys simply looks at the throne for a few seconds then walks away.\n\nNow there are a lot of things that this could mean. Maybe it's foreshadowing that he wants the throne, maybe foreshadowing that he wants Danny on the throne, OR maybe the whole conversation was an allegory for GRRM's entire story. Hear me out on this. \n\nOberyn and Varys are two completely opposite people. Oberyn indulges in whatever he desires, Varys does not. Oberyn lives in every moment and makes decisions based on passion and feeling, Varys is very careful in everything he does. Oberyn is fueled by anger, passion, and pleasure (like fire) and Varys is calculated, shrewd and cold (like ice). \n\nIt's possible (although unlikely and that I'm just thinking too much while bored at work) that this is an allegory for Westeros, where Oberyn represents the battle for the throne (fire) and Varys represents the battle against the White Walkers (ice). It's too early to tell since the series isn't over, but Oberyn's focus was on the present and Varys is focused on the future. Oberyn's death may prove how unimportant the war of the five kings (or queens now) is, while Varys' counsel to Khaleesi is going to prove incredibly important between the living and the dead. \n\nEnd rant.

(I acknowledge that he was in a pretty sticky situation with all the snow around Winterfell and all but he's seen Melisandre's power with shadow babies and all that.

", "id": "dae7qsn"}, {"comment": ">idk if you remember but in the books she has many moments od doubt, like when she leaves Meereen with Drogon.\n\nExactly, show is missing key beats with some characters like Jon or Dany. Jon is a just a footsoldier to them simple guy. Unlike in the books where he shows prowness for millitary tactics, actually quite smart in Northern politics, planned with Stannis his campaign (where to go, who to talked to) and how he prepared for the Long Night that is coming fot them.\n\nWith Dany they're missing this self doubt \"If I look back, I'm lost\" or house with the red door is what she really wants and not the Iron Throne. She does this pursuit of IT for her family and not because she wants like on the show. On the show she seems too regal, stone cold badass Queen, who rarely shows emotions. When she's just a scared child in a cruel world. Emilia is perfect in emotional scenes but for some reason they didn't gave her that much of material to work with.\n\nAs for the rest. Any ruler who was on the IT seemed arrogant one way or the other. It's a not a criticism for her but just an observation. She wants to rule but also helping people.\n\nI think D&D said she's a successful conqueror but not a ruler. Any ruler needs advisors and listen to them.

Her children are actually the main motivation in her evil acts, so Tommen's death may have actually tamed the lion rather than motivating it. Jon snow is hard to see as an evil character, but I think that his morality may actually play into it a bit. I think we might see a situation mirroring Ned Stark, where his sense of northern justice may prevent him from seeing the long term implications. In fact, he might even have to make the exact decision Ned made in the first season: killing Dany. Ned refused to kill Dany, presumably because of his own Targaryen child that almost died, but in doing so put Westeros at risk of Dothraki invasion.

The fact that his outfit is still black, though, is kind of cool because it's both a statement of reclaiming family and also remembering the journey that brought him there.\n\nI guess in a way it's a return to her roots for Dany too, as she's always been dressed in the style of other cultures, and I've always gotten the sense that someone else has dressed her, rather than she making style choices for herself. She never had her own culture, after all, though I guess it could be argued that the Targaryens lost their original culture, the Valyrian culture, a long time ago.

In short, Jon is famous now. His story will be well known. Even if they don't waste time showing us this conversation it's safe to assume Jorah will hear it.

The lack of a sword is the least important detail when it's one woman (who was tied to a horse and carried as a slave, which clearly established she's not superhumanly strong to the entire Dothraki horde) against dozens of warrior-chiefs. I'm just not buying the idea that her immunity to fire would transfix them to the point where not a single one would even try to save their lives by attacking her. I mean, you're already going to burn to death, maybe at least try to go out with a fight? No? Ok, just sit there and die horribly. Also, the fire spread ridiculously fast, as if the floor was soaked with gasoline.\n\n> Apart from that shit \"but we are not men\" line from season 3, when has Dany's gender became a factor in anything she represents in the story?\n\nYou're right, if Dany was male, she'd still get married to Khal Drogo, courted by the Black merchant in Qarth, be the Mother of Dragons, be called \"Mesa/Mother\" by armies of freed slaves, be brought to Vaes Dothrak as a sex slave/candidate for dosh khaleen, be swooned over by Jorah and Daario, get hit on by Asha Greyjoy, get sexually provoked by that mercenary captain... half of her storyline is her being a womynz in the cold hard sexist world of GoT, and the other half is indirectly caused by that. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, except her overly one-sided portrayal and lack of real consequences for the darker sides of her personality, especially when gauged against the brutal consequences suffered by male characters for much less serious offenses... yeah, there's a reason people are calling her a Mary Sue. It's because whenever she appears on screen, the world is made to revolve around how awesome she is (even though the parts of her character that were established by George Martin clearly show that he didn't view her as unequivocally positive), and even when she temporarily suffers humiliation, it's only to establish how triumphantly she will win against those evil men. Even if it takes random paralysis and gasoline-soaked floors. Textbook Mary Sue.\n\n > Stannis's arc was dull?\n\nWat?

It's about the character of Jaime Lannister as Ned sees it. Ned sees him as a cocky little Lannister prick. And honestly, I think Ned's right about that.

But when Jaime's father comes to sack King's Landing then it's an appropriate time to break your vows and kill the Mad King. Ned sees he kinglsaying as a way to protect Tywin, not the thousands of people who live in the city who would have been burned.

There may have been a major reset in terms of complex societies and high culture during the middle ages, but there's a reason that exploration, the Enlightenment and later the Industrial Revolution didn't happen at the height of the Roman Empire. \n\nBesides, the only things that have been lost seem to be magical. Valyrian Steel was a super guarded secret which only a few people in the world knew; I believe there are some ancient luxury goods which were like that. But things like Damascus Steel and Roman Concrete fell out of use because the city-state/empire/kingdom fell out of power. Changes to power balances are often what cause new technologies to emerge.

That also restricts the amount of maesters whk can learn and build on what thry have learnt etc. \n\nAnd even if all that had no effect, there are still tribes even now that have not advanced past hunter gathers.

Current Westerosi society resembles that of the late middle ages in terms of trade and access to foreign exotic technology like gunpowder and telescopes. From that stage of development, all it takes is a few lucky events - some guy nails a list of grievances on the door of a church, one army starts effectively using gunpowder-based weapons, a sailor goes West and does return, etc - and changes begin happening rather quickly. I think GRRM's reason that Westeros can't make those changes is because of the long winter that kills half the population, but there's no real historical evidence for societies consistently surviving winters that harsh.

Meaning that it would have been even more cumbersome.\n\nNot to mention how we see most Northerners fight. They are small and nimble, whereas Southern Knights hack and slash and need the extra protection. It's part of why Arya takes so well to Water Dancing.\n\nPlus plate armour seems to only be a thing in the true Southern Kingdoms.\n\nWe see Jorah with plate armour, but he is also a tourney knight. We see knights of the Vale with breastplates, but then again they are all truly Andal.\n\nThe Riverlands use scale armour, and the Northerners use leather and chainmail because those are the most efficient.\n\nThey aren't as heavy, they aren't as cumbersome, they are easy to repair, and it allows for easier thematic distinction."], [23, "Cold weather has nothing to do with it. You wear a gambeson under the plate to protect the skin from the movement of the plate. The problem with plate or even mail or any metal or horn armor worn over the entire body is that it requires a padded garment underneath. This allows no heat or sweat from the body to escape and a major threat to knights in full plate or mail in a hot summer was heat stroke. In cold weather fur could be added to the gambeson or a surcoat worn over the plate to add warmth.\n\nBTW, many of the Northerners wear pieces of plate, like gorgets and pauldrons and such.\n\nBTW, leather is NOT armor. Unless sewed in levels that are unmanageable, leather cannot protect against any weapons other than those that slice and dice. Leather when boiled in wax to the consistency of rawhide can be used as armor, but was mostly used as a supplement since it was easier to engrave boiled leather. Boiled leather helmets and armor pieces were used throughout history, but never in preference to metal.\n\nThe issue is cost. The North resembles in some ways the lowlands of Scotland or the border lands in northern England. The Scots could never produce enough battle cavalry to rival the English knights and men-at-arms, which led to a number of defeats when the English combined mounted charges with arrow storms from longbows. Plate was expensive, though the most expensive part of a knight's equipment was his war horse. Mail wasn't much cheaper, because of the manual labor required to make the rings, link them and butt and rivet the connecting links. Plate pieces, such as pauldrons, beviors, helmets, cuirasses, greaves were worn separately by both mounted and dismounted warriors. Plates could wired or riveted into a jacket, made of heavy cloth or leather, into a brigandine or a \"jack of plates\", such as Ned and Jon wear in the show. Mail coifs, \"bishop's mantles\", short shirts, hauberks and chaps could also be worn separately. Scale and lamellar armor was cheaper, as it consisted of small plates of metal or horn attached to a background. The scale was attached with each scale laid over the row below, so that downward blows encounter two levels of scales, but upward stabs could penetrate through the back garment, which was not good for a mounted warrior. Lamellar was small plates laced together with each plate covering the lower part of row above it. Thrusting upward and blows against the armor met resistance from multiple plates but downward stabs could slip between the plates. This is why feudal society developed. Not every military age male could be fully equipped once the administrative resources of the Empire disappeared, so people banded together to arm, equip and mount one amongst them. Since these were the best armed, they soon grabbed power and became a hereditary nobility. \n\nEven cheaper were aketons or jacks, which were jackets or coats of two layers of heavy cloth sewn together with raw cotton, rags, even straw, between the layers. Such a coat could withstand arrows from long range, blows by maces and clubs, but wasn't really much protection against lances, spears, pole-arms and swords. But it was better than nothing.\n\nNo Northerners are not small and nimble, certainly Ned, Jon and Robb were equal in size to most Southerners and no one could call Lord Manderly small and nimble.\n\nAs I said the North was much like lowland Scotland and northern England with a proud but poor nobility and gentry, and a large number of common freemen, free peasants and yeomen, who could partly armor themselves and fight in shield walls, or spear hedges and stand off any charge by knights as long as their morale held and they didn't face missile weapons. The Swiss solved that problem with their pike schiltrons by adding crossbowmen and hangunners on the flanks. The North has archers and crossbows are available, so using English dismounted tactics of blocks of longbows or crossbows behind palvaises or field fortifications, like pointed stakes alternating with blocks of infantry armed with pikes, spears, pole arms like bills, halberds, pole axes and shields would be simple. Where the North differs is that it's half the size of South America, so that even with an equivalent population density to lowland Scotland in 1200-1300 CE, there would be almost a million adult males of military age. If the military composition held true in proportion, there would be about 10,000 \"knights\" of the nobility with war horses and full armor, another 10,000 \"squires\" as medium cavalry with chargers and 3/4 armor, 10,000 heavy and medium cavalry from the gentry and 20,000 light cavalry like Anglo-Scot \"Border Reivers\" with border ponies, quarterhorses and lances, javelins, darts, helmets and some additional armor and shields. There would be 100,000 heavy armored foot with 3/4 armor with pikes and such, another 150,000 medium foot 1/4 to half armor with longbows or crossbows, 300,000 light/medium foot with longbows or crossbows and 400,000 light/medium foot with pikes, spears and such. The light foot would have jacks, helmets, shields and not much else. \n\nWhile you could mobilize all these men, the logistics aren't there to sustain them. In a feudal society as large as the North, transportation infrastructure would be minimal and primitive, so like Anglo-Saxon England, the King would go to the point of danger with his household troops, like the Huscarls and mobilize the local levy or fyrd. So if the Wall was threatened, Jon could probably raise 1/3 of the forces above within three weeks. The same if he had to defend the Neck or against a major Ironborn incursion. Any expeditionary force outside the North would not be much large than 1/6 to 1/12 of the above forces and then would be available only for 90 days. \n\nAs a comparison, the Lannisters were a rich house, at least through Season 2, as are the Tyrells. They can afford well equipped standing armies of professionals. Their levies, on the other hand, would be only slightly better equipped and armed than the North's. The Freys are as poor as the North, but the Tullys, holding the River Lands, while not rich enough to maintain standing armies, had nobility and freemen rich enough to afford better equipment and arms, like the Knights of the Vale. The Storm Lands were as poor as the North, while Dorn in the hot south would have arms and armor more like that of Iberia, less plate, more mail, less armor, more missile weapons like javelins and darts. As far as the ironborn, they are a small population base, their economics are based on raiding and trading, so they would be equipped based on wealth and with whatever they could buy or pillage.    "], [9, "It's not just leather. It's a coat of plates."], [7, "Because the showrunners and the design team have little background in medieval military history and as a result haven't developed many believable armour designs. People can downvote all they like, but this is the truth. They designed armour that looks good to those without much knowledge on the subject and suits the overall aesthetic that the producers are aiming for.\n\nIn this case, I suspect the goal was to show the Northerners as a simple, no nonsense people whose armour was more distinctive than the more common and more authentic mail. The large gaps between the plates and what I suspect is the use of soling leather instead of steel simplifies production, reduces costs and avoids the need for specialised craftsmen to build and maintain the costume.\n\nRobb's use of basic armour only mildly augmented with other pieces of defensive armour emphasizes his closeness to his men and his down to earth nature. It would have been more authentic for Robb to wear full plate - full plate was historically worn in Scandinavia, Scotland and other very cold places even in winter - but that wouldn't necessarily have matched the visual design desired.\n\nThe Lannister armour emphasizes the power and doctrine of House Lannister: more than any other House, the Lannister's infantry is dedicated to them, wearing their colours and a uniform style of armour that homogenizes them and distinguishes them from all others.\n\nThe remaining armour differs in an attempt to visually distinguish the different factions, leading to a situation where armour is far more radically different from region to region than in real life as a visual short hand for the audience, who can't really be expected to notice the more subtle differences that true authenticity would entail."], [6, "I'm sure robb had steel plate on when they captured jamie?"], [3, "The North is not wealthy either. Lannister soldiers can have gold and ornate decoration but that's not something Starks could afford to give all their men."], [4, "Stark armor is a brigandine, not just leather.

If you only wear one piece of armor, it should be on your freaking head."], [2, "their armour is likely brigandine, with a gambeson underneath, which is nearly as good as plate. \n\nIts certainly not poor.

You wear a gambeson under the plate to protect the skin from the movement of the plate. The problem with plate or even mail or any metal or horn armor worn over the entire body is that it requires a padded garment underneath. This allows no heat or sweat from the body to escape and a major threat to knights in full plate or mail in a hot summer was heat stroke. In cold weather fur could be added to the gambeson or a surcoat worn over the plate to add warmth.\n\nBTW, many of the Northerners wear pieces of plate, like gorgets and pauldrons and such.\n\nBTW, leather is NOT armor. Unless sewed in levels that are unmanageable, leather cannot protect against any weapons other than those that slice and dice. Leather when boiled in wax to the consistency of rawhide can be used as armor, but was mostly used as a supplement since it was easier to engrave boiled leather. Boiled leather helmets and armor pieces were used throughout history, but never in preference to metal.\n\nThe issue is cost. The North resembles in some ways the lowlands of Scotland or the border lands in northern England. The Scots could never produce enough battle cavalry to rival the English knights and men-at-arms, which led to a number of defeats when the English combined mounted charges with arrow storms from longbows. Plate was expensive, though the most expensive part of a knight's equipment was his war horse. Mail wasn't much cheaper, because of the manual labor required to make the rings, link them and butt and rivet the connecting links. Plate pieces, such as pauldrons, beviors, helmets, cuirasses, greaves were worn separately by both mounted and dismounted warriors. Plates could wired or riveted into a jacket, made of heavy cloth or leather, into a brigandine or a \"jack of plates\", such as Ned and Jon wear in the show. Mail coifs, \"bishop's mantles\", short shirts, hauberks and chaps could also be worn separately. Scale and lamellar armor was cheaper, as it consisted of small plates of metal or horn attached to a background. The scale was attached with each scale laid over the row below, so that downward blows encounter two levels of scales, but upward stabs could penetrate through the back garment, which was not good for a mounted warrior. Lamellar was small plates laced together with each plate covering the lower part of row above it. Thrusting upward and blows against the armor met resistance from multiple plates but downward stabs could slip between the plates. This is why feudal society developed. Not every military age male could be fully equipped once the administrative resources of the Empire disappeared, so people banded together to arm, equip and mount one amongst them. Since these were the best armed, they soon grabbed power and became a hereditary nobility. \n\nEven cheaper were aketons or jacks, which were jackets or coats of two layers of heavy cloth sewn together with raw cotton, rags, even straw, between the layers. Such a coat could withstand arrows from long range, blows by maces and clubs, but wasn't really much protection against lances, spears, pole-arms and swords. But it was better than nothing.\n\nNo Northerners are not small and nimble, certainly Ned, Jon and Robb were equal in size to most Southerners and no one could call Lord Manderly small and nimble.\n\nAs I said the North was much like lowland Scotland and northern England with a proud but poor nobility and gentry, and a large number of common freemen, free peasants and yeomen, who could partly armor themselves and fight in shield walls, or spear hedges and stand off any charge by knights as long as their morale held and they didn't face missile weapons. The Swiss solved that problem with their pike schiltrons by adding crossbowmen and hangunners on the flanks. The North has archers and crossbows are available, so using English dismounted tactics of blocks of longbows or crossbows behind palvaises or field fortifications, like pointed stakes alternating with blocks of infantry armed with pikes, spears, pole arms like bills, halberds, pole axes and shields would be simple. Where the North differs is that it's half the size of South America, so that even with an equivalent population density to lowland Scotland in 1200-1300 CE, there would be almost a million adult males of military age. If the military composition held true in proportion, there would be about 10,000 \"knights\" of the nobility with war horses and full armor, another 10,000 \"squires\" as medium cavalry with chargers and 3/4 armor, 10,000 heavy and medium cavalry from the gentry and 20,000 light cavalry like Anglo-Scot \"Border Reivers\" with border ponies, quarterhorses and lances, javelins, darts, helmets and some additional armor and shields. There would be 100,000 heavy armored foot with 3/4 armor with pikes and such, another 150,000 medium foot 1/4 to half armor with longbows or crossbows, 300,000 light/medium foot with longbows or crossbows and 400,000 light/medium foot with pikes, spears and such. The light foot would have jacks, helmets, shields and not much else. \n\nWhile you could mobilize all these men, the logistics aren't there to sustain them. In a feudal society as large as the North, transportation infrastructure would be minimal and primitive, so like Anglo-Saxon England, the King would go to the point of danger with his household troops, like the Huscarls and mobilize the local levy or fyrd. So if the Wall was threatened, Jon could probably raise 1/3 of the forces above within three weeks. The same if he had to defend the Neck or against a major Ironborn incursion. Any expeditionary force outside the North would not be much large than 1/6 to 1/12 of the above forces and then would be available only for 90 days. \n\nAs a comparison, the Lannisters were a rich house, at least through Season 2, as are the Tyrells. They can afford well equipped standing armies of professionals. Their levies, on the other hand, would be only slightly better equipped and armed than the North's. The Freys are as poor as the North, but the Tullys, holding the River Lands, while not rich enough to maintain standing armies, had nobility and freemen rich enough to afford better equipment and arms, like the Knights of the Vale. The Storm Lands were as poor as the North, while Dorn in the hot south would have arms and armor more like that of Iberia, less plate, more mail, less armor, more missile weapons like javelins and darts. As far as the ironborn, they are a small population base, their economics are based on raiding and trading, so they would be equipped based on wealth and with whatever they could buy or pillage.    ", "id": "dacgkt5"}, {"comment": ">Leather when boiled in wax to the consistency of rawhide can be used as armor, but was mostly used as a supplement since it was easier to engrave boiled leather.\n\nJust a quick note: you have this backwards. Waxed stuffed leather was used because it could be engraved prior to the stuffing because the process didn't distort the surface of the piece. However, wax stuffed leather is particularly bad against penetrating attacks, with the wax aiding penetration (although it still performs better than plain leather). In terms of durability, however, it exceeds all others and resists cuts extremely well. As a result, it is best suited to limb armour.\n\nRawhide (as per Edward Cheshire's testing), on the other hand, could be boiled to increase hardness considerably, while also remaining tougher than boiled leather. As a result, it was probably used as body armour, either in a breastplate  or in lamellar armour.\n\n>Where the North differs is that it's half the size of South America, so that even with an equivalent population density to lowland Scotland in 1200-1300 CE, there would be almost a million adult males of military age.\n\nCan I also say how insane this statement and your subsequent conclusions are? Even Bachrach doesn't claim such high numbers for the Carolingian Empire, and his estimates are considerably higher than anyone elses. Even with a population of 14 million, the Carolingian Empire didn't have access to anywhere near a million men for their military.\n\nEdit: okay, got that one wrong. It was Werner, not Bachrach, with the very large Carolingian estimate. 40 000 horse and 100 000 foot, although this was never fully drawn on. At most one third of the cavalry might be called in normal times of war, and the number of infantry would depend on how fast the march needed to be and would likely be mostly drawn from the area closest to the campaign jump off point.", "id": "dacrt35"}, {"comment": "The population estimate is based on Scotland of 1200-1300 CE extrapolated to the Wikki and community estimates of the size of Westeros and the North. As such, the North at the time before the War of the Five Kings would have around 10 million people (and all of Westeros, somewhere between 70 and 80 million). The estimated average number of males would be somewhere around 5 million. The number of males between 15 and 55, which could be mobilized would be somewhere around 2 million. The optimal military age of population of males between 17 and 35 would be around a million. Certainly, such numbers couldn't be mobilized at the same time as I indicated, 300,000 would be the maximum one could concentrate in a reasonable time in one location, say the west coast against the Ironborn, the Neck against the South or the Wall against the WWs. 25,000 to 50,000 would be the maximum for an expedition south of the Neck or an invasion of the Iron Islands or north of the Wall, which is close to the size of the army Robb Stark lead into the River Lands. Again this a first order analysis of MAXIMUM numbers. \n\nSuch numbers would be affected by a number of factors. Harald could only raise 7,000 men for Hastings with his and the local thegns' Huscarls and the fyrd (levy of all free men), but this would have increased to 10,000-12,000 in a few days as the local troops farther away from the scene of the battle answered his summons. This when England had a population of between 1.5 and 2.5 million, which would put all males at .75 to 1.25 million, all males available for mob at 375 to 660 thousand and optimal military population at 180,000 to 330,000 for the entire Kingdom. Given the population density, the transportation and communications network, the political and economic situation in south-west England, mobilizing 12,000 troops in a week was to be expected and had Harald had the political flexibility to fall back toward's London, he might have had 20-30,000 troops to face William of Normandy. So I don't think my numbers are far off for the North.\n\nThe Carolingian Empire was in the early medieval period. Westeros is obviously somewhat more advanced than Europe in the late Dark Ages. Thus my use of population estimates for the High Middle Age. Again, my estimates are of maximum military capability, not the optimal or actual probable size of the armies that could be mobilized, commanded and sustained in a fantasy world mixing elements of Medieval Europe from Norway to Spain and from the end of the Dark Ages into the early Renaissance periods.\n\nIn any case, GRRM writes fantasy not military history, so we just have to go with flow sometimes.", "id": "daf4o5m"}, {"comment": "Should note that logistics sometimes fly out the window in GoT.

But a full-faced helm was essential to the joust and war. A French king, name I can't remember, was jousting and a sliver of his opponent's lance penetrated the eye slits of his helm and he died a long and painful death. Generally, in a battle melee with other knights, everyone would face the same limitations.

He'd be devastated and blame himself. \n\nTywin would be interesting but futile as the Lannisters won't matter by the end of S7 in the grand scheme now. \n\nDoran would be good, another good dornish character. \n\nJon Arryn, no real point\n\nLord Commander Jeor Mormont. He could lead the watch again and convince Jorah to take the Black. \n\nRobb Stark would complicate things in the north. Would he or wouldnt he just step aside for Jon?\n\nCatlyn Stark love michelle fairley but no reason for her to be back unless she becomes you know who \n\nFuck the Boltons\n\nThe Blackfish, he would have been a great General for the North and important family member for Arya and Sansa, too bad he didn't see it that way\n\nRhaegar would be cool and with how vague it was maybe he isnt really dead\n\nDrogo would be legit he could really lead the Dothraki and I wanna see Momoa fight the wights. \n\nBarristan Selmy would be great but i would say his sacrifice was good eapecially after his speech to Daenerys about Rhaegar and the people of kingslanding\n\nMance Rayder would be interesting but unnecessary as i believe Jon and Tormund are fullfilling that role now together. \n\nThe one i would really like to see is Ser Arthur Dayne. Maybe he isnt really dead and is in hiding in Dorne somewhere. He would onow who Jon is and having the sword of the morning fighting beside Azor Ahai against the White Walkers would be awesome. Have him give a speech kinda like Barristan gave Daeny in Essos when he first showed up. Like i failed your family before, i will never fail them again.

In the dream as it had been in \u201clife. Yet these were no ordinary three. They waited before the round tower, the red mountains of Dorne at their backs, their white cloaks blowing in the wind. And these were no shadows; their faces burned clear, even now. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on his lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade with a whetstone. Across his white-enameled helm, the black bat of his House spread its wings. Between them stood fierce old Ser Gerold Hightower, the White Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. \u201cI looked for you on the Trident,\u201d Ned said to them. \u201cWe were not there,\u201d Ser Gerold answered. \u201cWoe to the Usurper if we had been,\u201d said Ser Oswell. \u201cWhen King\u2019s Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.\u201d \u201cFar away,\u201d Ser Gerold said, \u201cor Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.\u201d \u201cI came down on Storm\u2019s End to lift the siege,\u201d Ned told them, .,and the and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.\u201d \u201cOur knees do not bend easily,\u201d said Ser Arthur Dayne. \u201cSer Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.\u201d \u201cSer Willem is a good man and true,\u201d said Ser Oswell. \u201cBut not of the Kingsguard,\u201d Ser Gerold pointed out. \u201cThe Kingsguard does not flee.\u201d \u201cThen or now,\u201d said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm. \u201cWe swore a vow,\u201d explained old Ser Gerold. Ned\u2019s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven against three. \u201cAnd now it begins,\u201d said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light. \u201cNo,\u201d Ned said with sadness in his voice. \u201cNow it ends.\u201d As they came together in a rush of steel and shadow, he could hear Lyanna screaming. \u201cEddard!\u201d she called. A storm of rose petals blew across a blood-streaked sky, as blue as the eyes of death.\u201d. \u201cLord Eddard,\u201d Lyanna called again. \u201cI promise,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLya, I promise\u201d\n", "id": "dadkmzs"}], [{"comment": "I think\n\n> Season 4: Oberyn visits Tyrion - https://youtu.be/M7n79tN6Fpw\n\nwas the absolute highlight of the whole series.

Season 6, was about Lyanna. Season 7, we will get Rheagar a little bit. Also, we will see a flashback of them both. Jon is the most important character in this story.
