Don't know if any of that back story is true, but can confirm our early 80's chuck e cheese in Orlando had only top halves of characters, and both showbiz and chuck e cheese from my childhood were in large free standing buildings that would be embarrassed by the strip center fragments they are now. When I was little, the arcades were in different room from the animatronics performances, which were multi tier dinner theater style seating at showbiz and a giant room the size of a movie theater at chuck e cheese (might have actually been an old theater I don't remember for sure). The local showbiz also had a third section that was a bar and lounge where liquor was served, smoking was allowed, and the bar was surrounded by the old table top coin op games, which were new at the time.

That's how.\n\nAn organization dedicated to the defense of humanity against the things that go bump in the night. Their mission is to secure, contain, and protect these objects, and protect the world from them.

But's it's all for the greater good - to prevent death and destruction on a massive scale.\n\nYes, it's all a massive collective effort in fiction. The format allows for some interesting options for playing around with storytelling. Many of the first batch of SCP entries (those from 001-1000) had a strong horror bent. The later entries tend to be a bit less outright horror, and more sci-fi. Doesn't mean that you won't necessarily find heavy doses of sci-fi and horror in any grouping.\n\nBasically, you should give this stuff a read. I love it all.

The man was never a socialist. In fact, he opposed german socialists and communists for a very long time and professed an hatred of them. He also had no trouble cozying up with big business. And handing over the means of production to the masses or creating a classless society was never even a goal of his. \n\nStating that the man was not a socialist is not a fallacy.

To sum it up I was on an island of a people that needed to be liberated.  I made friends.  I had some sort of metal tool that could turn into anything.  There was a catch; the more I was deluded into thinking this dream was reality the more the tool would 'obey' me and turn into anything I wanted.  The more I started doubting the dream and realizing I was only dreaming the tool would melt into this metallic goo, leaving me in a situation where I was forcing myself within my own dream to forget reality.  \n\nOne of my most fond moments in this dream was turning the tool into a pruning hook and gathering fruit from this huge tree to feed a group of children.\n\nAny time I wanted to break from the dream I came right back to my bedroom, paralyzed, with that black creature starting at me; giving me incentive to fall back into slumber I retreated back into the same dream.\n\nEventually my 'friends' and I within the dream liberated this small island primarily due to crafty use of this strange omni-tool I possessed.  After celebrations I became fully aware of the dream and explained to these figments of my own imagination (which after my percieved 3 weeks I grew fond of) that I had a life to return to; a wife I loved and family I missed.\n\nThey turned on me with distorted faces, clawing and screaming they explained that if I woke up they wouldn't exist anymore.  It was terrifying to see these 'friends' with bloodlust in their eyes all aiming towards me.  \n\nI woke up in my bed and the creature was gone.  I felt guilt for people that my own mind made up.  I was relieved though that I could return to my perfect happy life.\n\nIn the following month my wife left me, I lost my home, car, job, everything.\n\nCoincidence?  Probably.

To sum it up I was on an island of a people that needed to be liberated.  I made friends.  I had some sort of metal tool that could turn into anything.  There was a catch; the more I was deluded into thinking this dream was reality the more the tool would 'obey' me and turn into anything I wanted.  The more I started doubting the dream and realizing I was only dreaming the tool would melt into this metallic goo, leaving me in a situation where I was forcing myself within my own dream to forget reality.  \n\nOne of my most fond moments in this dream was turning the tool into a pruning hook and gathering fruit from this huge tree to feed a group of children.\n\nAny time I wanted to break from the dream I came right back to my bedroom, paralyzed, with that black creature starting at me; giving me incentive to fall back into slumber I retreated back into the same dream.\n\nEventually my 'friends' and I within the dream liberated this small island primarily due to crafty use of this strange omni-tool I possessed.  After celebrations I became fully aware of the dream and explained to these figments of my own imagination (which after my percieved 3 weeks I grew fond of) that I had a life to return to; a wife I loved and family I missed.\n\nThey turned on me with distorted faces, clawing and screaming they explained that if I woke up they wouldn't exist anymore.  It was terrifying to see these 'friends' with bloodlust in their eyes all aiming towards me.  \n\nI woke up in my bed and the creature was gone.  I felt guilt for people that my own mind made up.  I was relieved though that I could return to my perfect happy life.\n\nIn the following month my wife left me, I lost my home, car, job, everything.\n\nCoincidence?  Probably.

The figure and the background are in two different parts of space right now and you need them to be together. If you layer the acrylic thinly over parts of the painting it will look deeper. Make the figure deeper into the space. The white is too white and your darks aren't dark enough. Look at rembrant's or Caravaggio's work and their use of light and dark. They are masters at glazing.

I will remove this comment if desired. Alternatively, constructive criticism is welcome!\n********\nA rare and pernicious form of ghost, the wanderer is one possible result of a soul which has been denied passage to the afterlife. Exactly how this occurs is unknown, but it results in a spirit left to wander the Ethereal and Astral planes, trying to find its resting place without guide or directions. Almost inevitably, such a spirit gets horribly lost, and after sufficient time spent wandering the planes without an anchoring body or hope of finding a way out, the spirit begins to go mad and lose its original nature. Once this occurs, the spirit will forget its goal and forge deeper and deeper into the planes, becoming changed by the experience.\n\nOccasionally, one will \"wash up\" on the shores of the Material Plane. Separated from the planes which have, regrettably, become its home, the wandering spirit will attempt to return there by siphoning the soul energy of mortal beings until it can find or create a way across.

Back then we had easily forged paper money, and had only just introduced our two dollar coin because our lower paper denominations were doing the whole disintegrating thing; we'd only just started printing $100 notes about four years prior.\n\nDue to this a lot of things were incredibly cheap; since $50 notes were our highest currency and $100 were weird looking and commonly thought to be fake. This means we could only afford to use colours on the greyscale spectrum; we didn't discover there were actually red kangaroos until the mid 90s because we all thought they were meant to be grey.\n\nThis unfortunately exacerbated the dropbear problem. Koalas and dropbears both are primarily coloured grey; their only distinguishing feature of the dropbear was their blood-red eyes. Bouyed by the failures of the Great Emu War and wanting to make a badass name for themselves, many frightened farmers went out and shot the harmless koalas thinking they were dropbears. Now both are relatively rare to find in the wild.\n\nWe only recently managed to get internet too. Dialup modems make a really nice sound, and they're a lot faster than the tincans and string we've been using in the past couple of years.\n\nEDIT: Somehow I fatfingered the 9.

One guard claimed it would occasionally turn on when she would go in during her rounds - even though she quickly got into the habit of turning it off at the mains when walking past.\n\n- Coney has a silhouette wall facing the midway, with cutout windows on either side. The facade is covered in LED's which are programmed to turn off at midnight. Two *separate* guards, working years apart, told me they'd seen a shadow pass behind the silhouette wall and turn to look out the window just as the lights switched off.\n\n-  There are CCTV cameras downstairs in foyer 1 of the Big Top, the concert venue. I was solemnly told by the head of security that footage existed of a ball being bounced back and forth, in an otherwise empty room. \n\n- It has an upstairs mezzanine, with heavy steel poles which support mesh grates to form a removable fence. Two of the boys were working on ground floor overnight one night when one of those grates inexplicably flung itself over the edge.\n\n- A guard said the disabled lift, on his first shift,  played a warning message to stay away from the door. The lift has no such safety system in place. \n\nThe only reason I give any of these stories any creedence at all is that once, godawful late at night, I was doing something or other in there on my own.

It also creates new artificial reefs for the fish and coral to thrive again. There is a rule that snorkelers can't wear sunscreen because it's bad for the ocean ecology and part of the reason the reefs have been suffering. So if you go, wear a shirt or wetsuit. There are also dive tours to this particular location but I have only ever used a snorkel. It's roughly 25ft deep and visibility is high.\n\nThere actually is a section of these statues that I found pretty creepy. It features a group of chained and kneeling humans. I know there is a story to them, but I don't know for sure what it is. My guess is that they depict colonial slaves.\n\n\nPS: the island survives only because of tourism.

There are also several other statues below that aren't people, like a VW bus. These were created because the nearby reef was/is dying due to tourism and this draws people away. It also creates new artificial reefs for the fish and coral to thrive again. There is a rule that snorkelers can't wear sunscreen because it's bad for the ocean ecology and part of the reason the reefs have been suffering. So if you go, wear a shirt or wetsuit. There are also dive tours to this particular location but I have only ever used a snorkel. It's roughly 25ft deep and visibility is high.\n\nThere actually is a section of these statues that I found pretty creepy. It features a group of chained and kneeling humans. I know there is a story to them, but I don't know for sure what it is. My guess is that they depict colonial slaves.\n\n\nPS: the island survives only because of tourism. Long ago it was a fishing village but commercial fishing and an influx of tourism on the mainland pretty much killed it's chances of remaining that way.

The sound reminds me of the whispering voices from the game [Quake](https://youtu.be/qVOHTGYoM6E?t=7m40s). (Listen to that with headphones for full effect.)\n\nI'm fascinated by this sort of stuff, but as much as I want to believe it, I'm also a bit skeptical. The one thing that seems a bit fishy to me is the part where he makes it a point to say that the video is being done in [one take](https://youtu.be/UVEU6n2eKtg?t=4m40s). He goes on to explain that he's doing that because people have made comments about his videos being edited. In my opinion, if I were going to try and fake a video like this, I believe doing it all in one take would only help add to the authenticity. When something is \"unedited\" it makes it feel more legit. I'm not saying this video is fake (I can't prove that and judging by his other videos he seems like a rather authentic guy), but again it just makes me wonder. The internet has made me skeptical of everything!!\n\nThat being said, the sound doesn't seem as though it was added later. It definitely seems to be there with him and captured with the camera mic. If you listen to the video with headphones on you can get a sense of the stereo location of it as he passes by the area and even turns around to point back at it.\n\nHere's [another video](https://youtu.be/Stxpo4CdE_Y) I found with creepy sounds coming out a mine that has more of a \"hissing\" sort of quality to it. I remember seeing yet another video awhile back where a guy was exploring an old barn/abandoned house and came upon some sort of bird that was making these creepy whisper-like/hissing noises too. However, if these noises are indeed legit, I would imagine this guy is a bit too deep inside a mine for it to be a bird or owl.

Definitely creepy stuff! The sound reminds me of the whispering voices from the game [Quake](https://youtu.be/qVOHTGYoM6E?t=7m40s). (Listen to that with headphones for full effect.)\n\nI'm fascinated by this sort of stuff, but as much as I want to believe it, I'm also a bit skeptical. The one thing that seems a bit fishy to me is the part where he makes it a point to say that the video is being done in [one take](https://youtu.be/UVEU6n2eKtg?t=4m40s). He goes on to explain that he's doing that because people have made comments about his videos being edited. In my opinion, if I were going to try and fake a video like this, I believe doing it all in one take would only help add to the authenticity. When something is \"unedited\" it makes it feel more legit. I'm not saying this video is fake (I can't prove that and judging by his other videos he seems like a rather authentic guy), but again it just makes me wonder. The internet has made me skeptical of everything!!\n\nThat being said, the sound doesn't seem as though it was added later. It definitely seems to be there with him and captured with the camera mic. If you listen to the video with headphones on you can get a sense of the stereo location of it as he passes by the area and even turns around to point back at it.\n\nHere's [another video](https://youtu.be/Stxpo4CdE_Y) I found with creepy sounds coming out a mine that has more of a \"hissing\" sort of quality to it. I remember seeing yet another video awhile back where a guy was exploring an old barn/abandoned house and came upon some sort of bird that was making these creepy whisper-like/hissing noises too. However, if these noises are indeed legit, I would imagine this guy is a bit too deep inside a mine for it to be a bird or owl. But what do I know, I'm no expert.\n\nBesides, the sounds in the video you posted sound much more subtle and very much like whispering voices. Whatever is going on, it definitely creeps me out.", "id": "danvc5q"}, {"comment": "I was wondering the EXACT same thing. This guy is very authentic, and his videos are genuine and it doesn't seem like something he would do.

There is no pulley system set up and the water is too shallow. Probably ran dry years ago. The boy/young man is reaching towards the humanoid creature as it extends clawed hands above it's head with a sneer. \n\n\nMost likely the creature is using some sort of mental paralyses on it's victims, or its a tribute of some sort. Also possible the creature is benevolent. Either way you want to go in with either very strong mental fortitude, or very drunk/high on something that would also interfere with the creatures abilities.\n\n\n\nFor instance, start taking large amounts of hallucinatory drugs for a few years. Become one with trips that would make other people puke and cry like children.\n\n\n\nApproach the well with good intentions. Try to mask your plans behind your subconscious. Right as you reach the well, the drugs should be kicking in, pretty much right as the creature enters your mind.\n\n\n\nAt this point to be safe, let's assume the creature has scanned your subconscious and found your true reason behind approaching the well. We act fast.\n\n\nThrow yourself down the well, legs first, like a navy seal. If the creatures blocks itself with the arms, you've already won. The creature's arms are wayyyy to long to properly function in that tight space. It won't be able to throw you down.\n\n\n Downward striking elbows to its thinker until it collapses, then heel strikes to the back of the head when it's down. You're gunna be lacerated from those claws and probably some gnash marks, so use your clothing to stop the bleeding.\n\n\nAnother person will come to the well as a sacrifice, in which you declare your dominance over the gods and demand he find a rope. Be sure to have them hoist the creature out first, If you can hold on to its ankle and pull yourself out of the well without anyone helping you to really seal the deal.\n\n\nIn the event you both fall through some parallel universe he is holding open, and you find yourself standing over his body in some dark place filled with nightmares and horror, abandon all hope of returning to your pleasant terra planet/reality. The first thing these inter-dimensional creatures see is you coming out of the portal with a body sneering. Keep that going. Spread death and chaos throughout the multiverse until you find yourself standing in a well, beckoning simple mortals to feed your lust for souls.

My hypothetical wife would sit and dish with Mother about various intrauterine function, and complain lightheartedly about the miscellaneous annoying things I do on a daily basis, falling more in love with me as she does so: and some day, when I die\u2014if my hypothetical children will it\u2014I'll be plasticized, too, and arranged in some way that compliments my mother, and we'll sit together in the living room of our children's house (they'll be so close that they'll live together their whole lives), always and forever, a testament to a long and rewarding mother-son relationship. (Here's hoping neither of us die in car accidents.)

More than 115 were given sea burials, the rest were taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and assigned to three cemeteries or returned to their families. The people who didn't get off the ship have been trapped inside, their bodies out of reach.\n\n\n>According to the Times, Ballard said, \"When those bodies went down, they stayed down.\" Then, looking at a set of photos taken by an underwater robot, he paused at an image that showed a small patch of deck near the stern of the ship. There, sitting in a clump of debris, sat a pair of leather shoes, more like boots. \"You see these shoes down there?\" he said. \"There used to be bodies in those shoes. The body parts deteriorated, and the skeletal remains decalcified. The only thing left are the shoes, and the leather is perfectly preserved.\" The tannin in the shoe leather had apparently resisted the bacteria.\n\n>Ballard says there are a number of these shoe pairs, and because of their position, their location, because he's talked to people who know these things, each pair are evidence of a former life.

But I think the general consensus is that they ARE the work of Goya.\n\nMy favorite work is El Perro (the dog): https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Goya_Dog.jpg/800px-Goya_Dog.jpg\n\nIt's a piece of Modern Art that seems to have been painted 100 years before anything like it.", "id": "dakx80x"}, {"comment": "What do you like about this painting?", "id": "dal4tgd"}, {"comment": "A lot of it is the context. It was the end of Goya's life; he had survived several major illnesses; he was someone in a despairing state; and he chose to paint these paintings directly on the walls of the place he was living in. They were clearly not intended for the public; they weren't commissioned, they were not removable--well, until after his death when the portions of the wall with the paintings were literally cut from the room... They were the most personal statement of one of the greatest artists of all time.\n\nSo all of the images are striking and betray something very dark in Goya; but this particular one hits me on a very gut level. Probably because of the subject matter; a simple dog. It's not a \"pleasant\" scene. A lot of people said it looks like a dog sinking in quicksand, looking up for help which isn't arriving.\n\nTo me this dog reminds me of my dog Daisy; she was a pit bull raised for fighting. About 18 months ago, she managed to crawl under the fence of the house where her and her companions were kept, and (still chained) barked until neighbors found her. Animal control was called and eventually the guy was arrested for animal cruelty and a weapons violation (he was on parole and not allowed to have a gun). Now he's in jail for six years and Daisy was the hero that put his ass away.\n\nUnfortunately like a lot of dogs from these situations she just has a ton of issues she deals with; she's such a sweet dog... loves my cats, likes to just chill at home. But when someone comes to visit it clearly stresses her out. She is scared of thresholds and doors; every time she needs to go outside to poop or pee it's just an anxiety-filled ordeal for her. She just goes through life with a palpable amount of anxiety that weighs on her constantly. I call it her Anxiety Monster to decides to come fuck with her throughout the day.\n\nSo to me this image is Daisy, struggling against forces that are simply not her doing, looking up hopefully for someone to help. And I imagine myself right off the side, reaching out to help her up and give her a pat and a treat, and let her know everything's ok.", "id": "dal5gte"}, {"comment": "I really like your reading of this image.

And it adds more weight to the art. \n\nIn such a situation if the either of them takes off the mask it would compromise the filtration of the other mask, thus killing both of them. If the filter becomes full they both die.

The filters have various layers of different materials to combat each specific type of threat, and generally some activated charcoal as well. When you breathe through the filter it takes out any of the stuff you don't want to breathe. Also interesting to note that you don't breathe out through the filter, there's a separate exhale valve on gas masks to let air out.\n\nAnother thing to note is that gas masks don't make oxygen, they just filter out the bad stuff.

They come out in the rain not because of suffocation but because they can move around now, but couldn't when it was dry. \n\nOil in the water makes sense if it's been for a while, because they'd automatically move away from suffocation environments. Another reason could be high acidity in the water, maybe a spill of something, and they'd move from that even quicker. \n\nBut this is highly unusual, never seen it before... \n\nSource: PhD on earthworms.

Regardless of cultural norms, there are a limited set of universal truths to be known about the well-being of conscious creatures because these living beings exist in the context of a reality that we all share. There are universal truths about the conditions in which humans flourish best.\n\nWhat often changes these conditions are beliefs about reality harbored at the societal level. Because these are beliefs held about the same reality we all live in, they can either be right or wrong. In the context of this particular Aztec society you might be able to justify the brutal sacrifice of an innocent child through your superstitious belief in an angry deity that needs to be appeased, but that justification doesn't mean shit if the deity isn't fucking real. He isn't objectively real in our society, and he wasn't objectively real in theirs. They were wrong, and it led them to destroy the life of a child. The reality is, that child died and suffered for no damned reason.\n\nNow, I will say that placing blame on a mistaken culture that did not have access to the depth of knowledge that we do today is entirely pointless. The point I'm making is more related to how cultures shape their views of morality. At the end of the day, we all share the same reality regardless of how our cultural views construe it.

Every biologically-normal human being will experience it in this way.\n\nWhat about the person wearing the burka by choice? She might do so because she believes in earnest that her God wants her to do so. In that light, the physiological side effects do not go away, but they are much more bearable to her. She may even take pleasure in the discomfort because it makes her feel good to follow her God's will.\n\nThe real problem here is that this person's justification is entirely contingent on the existence of this pro-burka God. Even if her beliefs entirely changed the experience from a negative one to an overall positive one, it still doesn't change the fact that her perception is based entirely on a view that is either right or wrong. In a real objective sense, the God either exists or he doesn't.\n\nThe point isn't that we can disprove this God. We can't because this God was defined in such a way as to be non-falsifiable (though we can infer probabilities, that is an entirely separate argument). The point is also not to say that this woman who derives pleasure from wearing this burka should not be allowed to do so.
