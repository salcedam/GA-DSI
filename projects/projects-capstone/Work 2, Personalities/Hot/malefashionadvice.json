After that, there's no discomfort at all and I haven't experienced any exacerbated sweating. Admittedly, this comfort (or absence of discomfort) is really a feature of quality leather and construction.\n\nThe rationale for a dress boot as opposed to a dress shoe is, \"Why not?\" Not being facetious.

We mention it but try not to cram it down anyone's throat. I don't recycle leather because I am a vegan or vegetarian or because its \"hot right now\" (it isn't.) I recycle leather because I believe in trying to eliminate as much waste as possible in the world.\n\nThese days it is incredibly easy to buy anything you could possibly imagine from Walmart, Amazon or any of the other major retailers. I spend a lot of time in thrift stores, junk and scrap yards and the amount of waste I see on a daily basis is insane. An unimaginable amount of stuff is being produced every day just to eventually end up sitting with other piles of junk a few years later. \n\nSome items are innately disposable, but other common household items shouldn't be. You shouldn't need to buy a new blender because the motor was designed to fail in yours. I suppose if there is any kind of message here it is to think hard about what you purchase. Choose quality goods that will last whenever possible and try to see if something you want is already sitting out there going to waste. Buying that blender used instead would be a great way to make use of something that was otherwise being wasted and it would help alleviate the need for new packaging to be created. You make the choice with your dollar. \n\nI am immensely appreciative that people chose to buy a wallet from some guy rather than a larger name company and I hope I can leverage some of this publicity to get people to think a little bit about waste. \n\nTL;DR  Reuse - Recycle - Go thrifting", "id": "daokwzf"}, {"comment": "I'm buying a wallet from you and you're gonna fucking like it", "id": "daoq92j"}, {"comment": "So you're saying I shouldn't buy a slim to replace my janky wallet that just won't die \u2639\ufe0f", "id": "daoma2n"}, {"comment": ":D having a second, weekend wallet wouldn't be a terrible idea. \n\nYou know, to promote the longevity of both wallets.

I'm writing a guide on moving past the basics.", "id": "dapoxbq"}, {"comment": "The first step is to take the time to look around, look far and wide, look at *everything* for styles that attract you. But importantly, don't dismiss that which you don't like. Contemplate the reasons behind both liking and disliking something. The goal isn't to accumulate the *knowledge* of things you like, but to gain an *understanding* of *why* you like what you like.\n\nPart of that process is figuring out what *fashion* means to you.\n\n- Do you see clothing as a vehicle for maneuvering yourself through social situations, and the wear and tear of everyday life?\n\n- Do you see your image as a means for altering and controlling others' perceptions of you; for impressing your membership in a sociocultural group or economic strata?\n\n- Do you see fashion as a mode for creative self-expression, the paint of style on a body of canvas? Is it relevant to you what sort of *feeling* your aesthetic imparts onto an observer?\n\n- How much are you willing to sacrifice for the sake of fashion?\n\n*Practical needs; social cues; self expression*; and surely there are other factors as well. All are relevant to some extent, but you need to figure out what's most important to you, as some may require the compromise of others.\n\nAnd notably, the more your sense of style deviates from the norms *of the contexts your lifestyle entails*, the more you should expect to compromise on certain points in order to make outfits *wearable* in both the sense of working for your lifestyle, and also that of not drawing an undue amount of attention (to your own standards).\n\n(And also - while not of philosophical import, but definitely practical import - deviating from mainstream fashion norms often, though not always, means a higher *minimum* expense for garments.)\n\nOnly by understanding what you like, the reasons why, and what is *practical and reasonable* for your lifestyle can you be able to cultivate your aesthetic; to be able to curate your wardrobe, and use it to build cohesive, wearable outfits, reflective of your fashion ideals; presenting the image of yourself that you want to present.\n\nThen you go out and do it; that process is a whole other nightmare, but the recommendation of course is to take it slow and steady. Incremental change is the safest (and most affordable). (Personally, I chose the nuclear option.)\n\nThen you realize you fucked up!\n\nThen you reassess everything again, and repeat - improving every time of course ;)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n(e: while most of this is generally applicable imo, a good bit is moreso relevant to those likeminded to me. Certain others, e.g. those interested in hypebeast-streetwear type stuff, aren't as much addressed.

I also wrote [a thing about loose clothes last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/3n12h4/wide_pants_and_looser_silhouette_inspiration/).\n\nBasically I favor interesting loose/wide proportions and don't worry too much if it's approved by others. it started with an appreciation of Yohji Yamamoto and wound up motivating me to move to Japan and experience the clothes firsthand. I'm heavily inspired by the Japanese brands that I love and wear that eschew conventional western notions of fit and instead embrace comfort and the development of a personalized sense of style.\n\nI don't think you're missing anything per se, but perhaps you aren't familiar with that kinda stuff - not your fault, I just prefer fairly niche foreign labels that make loose clothes for whatever reason. Edwina Horl is one of my favorites, others you may find interesting are Yantor, My Beautiful Landlet, House of the Very Islands, and Whowhat.

Uniqlo and J Crew Factory are usually good starting places for beginners with a decent/good price to quality ratio.\n\nOnce you have a foundation of clothes, you can start upgrade piece by piece. /r/goodyearwelt is a good piece to understand quality shoes and boots. /r/rawdenim is a good piece to learn about jeans and denim.\n\nIt can definitely be a vast amount of information, but it's never up too late to start.

Additionally, the average person you'll meet is not as versed nor interested in fashion as a MFA regular. Which is to say that hardly anybody you meet in real life will critique you, so your fashion adventures should be all about you.\n\nAs others have already suggested, a) explore sidebar and b) update your wardrobe an item or two at a time.\n\nYou mentioned winter, so I assume you live in a temperate clime?  The bonus of the button-downs you've already purchased is that you can simply layer with a sweater for a winter update. Certainly, Uniqlo has great price:quality basics. Check out promotions for their wool sweaters, $20-$30 for an item that will last you a couple years. But also window-shop other brands you like, definitely keep an eye out for a heavier shawl-collar cardigan.\n\nBOOTS i.e. the most expensive item in a wardrobe. A worthwhile pair will run $150-300+ but will last years, if not decades, with good care habits. Check out r/goodyearwelt for their sidebar and inspiration/advice. My entry was LL Bean's Katahdin by Chippewa (purchased on sale). If you have occasion to dress up, Allen Edmonds will have a good sale twice/thrice a year and you basically can't go wrong with AE (also get your Brannock from them!).\n\nAnd not exactly fashion, however, consider working on being a discerning consumer.

Some companies essentially license their brand to various manufacturers who will produce the items that get sold in Macy's at a massive markup."], [2, "You look good!

Congrats on the weight loss.\n\nAs /u/ZiggyTheAlpaca mentioned, check out the guides. Start slow and figure out what you like and dislike. My personal #1 rule: Fit is key, but it looks like you have the hang of it.  \n\nSlowly build up your wardrobe. Check out /r/frugalmalefashion for deals, but buy within your budget (my personal #2 rule). It is very easy to lose control and then have buyer's remorse. Uniqlo and J Crew Factory are usually good starting places for beginners with a decent/good price to quality ratio.\n\nOnce you have a foundation of clothes, you can start upgrade piece by piece. /r/goodyearwelt is a good piece to understand quality shoes and boots. /r/rawdenim is a good piece to learn about jeans and denim.\n\nIt can definitely be a vast amount of information, but it's never up too late to start. It is a marathon, not a sprint. There's a ton of brands that you probably never heard of it that are better than your mainstream mall brands, but you'll find them out on your journey.

The bonus of the button-downs you've already purchased is that you can simply layer with a sweater for a winter update. Certainly, Uniqlo has great price:quality basics. Check out promotions for their wool sweaters, $20-$30 for an item that will last you a couple years. But also window-shop other brands you like, definitely keep an eye out for a heavier shawl-collar cardigan.\n\nBOOTS i.e. the most expensive item in a wardrobe. A worthwhile pair will run $150-300+ but will last years, if not decades, with good care habits. Check out r/goodyearwelt for their sidebar and inspiration/advice. My entry was LL Bean's Katahdin by Chippewa (purchased on sale). If you have occasion to dress up, Allen Edmonds will have a good sale twice/thrice a year and you basically can't go wrong with AE (also get your Brannock from them!).\n\nAnd not exactly fashion, however, consider working on being a discerning consumer.

Enjoy.\n\n-----\n\n##For users new to MFA: Welcome!\n\n \n**What is WAYWT?**\n\n * WAYWT stands for *What Are You Wearing Today*, an auto-posted recurring thread where users in MFA post their outfits. This album is a collection of fits the community has liked. There's a script written by the awesome /u/thomaspaine that collects the images that have exceeded 100 upvotes, and it all gets compiled into this thread. ([You can find the code on glithub here.](https://github.com/dziegler/redditfashion) \n)[Threads from earlier months.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/topofwaywt)\n\n**Those shoes on the dude in picture X are dope, what are they?**\n\n* To quickly find out what an item of clothing is, check the full listing of links to the individual posts (below) and usually the post will list the items worn and/or you can PM wearer and ask them to tell you what they are wearing.\n\n**Why so few larger dudes in this album?**\n\n * MFA's a place that helps users regardless of their body type, which is why some of our users have put together [an album of heavier guys looking good](http://imgur.com/a/S6ei9) and [a guide to dressing well.](http://redd.it/14zheh) As to the lack of heavier guys in the album, it's a fair question. MFA's not purposefully excluding them, for sure.\n\n**Why are there more blurred faces on here than /r/gonewild?**\n\n* Users choose to blur their face for many reasons.  Anonymity is one of the main reasons.  We've already had [one known case](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1st0fb/general_discussion_dec_13th/ce0x3u2) where a user's face was taken and used to hit on underaged girls on another site.  Another reason is to put the focus on the clothes and not what the person looks like.  We suggest to most users to block out their face for those reasons, but it's up to the individual user.  \n\n**Honest question - are most of you gay?**\n\n * It may be an honest question and you're not the first to wonder, but [as /u/Syeknom outlines in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1iqzbq/sunday_morning_discussion_sexuality_and_style/cb780xh) (which was quickly posted to /r/bestof), it's a poor question that rests on some shallow assumptions about gender and sexuality.  If you're really curious, [according to the 2014 community census, about 8% of MFA subscribers identify themselves as something other than heterosexual.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1zw25x/2014_mfa_survey_census_results/)\n\n----\n\nSide note to MFA regulars: [Read /u/rjbman's comment from way back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1hebki/top_of_waywt_june_2013/catip8q) -\n\nguys, can we please not have any negative /r/all comments?

Enjoy.\n\n-----\n\n##For users new to MFA: Welcome!\n\n \n**What is WAYWT?**\n\n * WAYWT stands for *What Are You Wearing Today*, an auto-posted recurring thread where users in MFA post their outfits. This album is a collection of fits the community has liked. There's a script written by the awesome /u/thomaspaine that collects the images that have exceeded 100 upvotes, and it all gets compiled into this thread. ([You can find the code on glithub here.](https://github.com/dziegler/redditfashion) \n)[Threads from earlier months.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/topofwaywt)\n\n**Those shoes on the dude in picture X are dope, what are they?**\n\n* To quickly find out what an item of clothing is, check the full listing of links to the individual posts (below) and usually the post will list the items worn and/or you can PM wearer and ask them to tell you what they are wearing.\n\n**Why so few larger dudes in this album?**\n\n * MFA's a place that helps users regardless of their body type, which is why some of our users have put together [an album of heavier guys looking good](http://imgur.com/a/S6ei9) and [a guide to dressing well.](http://redd.it/14zheh) As to the lack of heavier guys in the album, it's a fair question. MFA's not purposefully excluding them, for sure.\n\n**Why are there more blurred faces on here than /r/gonewild?**\n\n* Users choose to blur their face for many reasons.  Anonymity is one of the main reasons.  We've already had [one known case](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1st0fb/general_discussion_dec_13th/ce0x3u2) where a user's face was taken and used to hit on underaged girls on another site.  Another reason is to put the focus on the clothes and not what the person looks like.  We suggest to most users to block out their face for those reasons, but it's up to the individual user.  \n\n**Honest question - are most of you gay?**\n\n * It may be an honest question and you're not the first to wonder, but [as /u/Syeknom outlines in this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1iqzbq/sunday_morning_discussion_sexuality_and_style/cb780xh) (which was quickly posted to /r/bestof), it's a poor question that rests on some shallow assumptions about gender and sexuality.  If you're really curious, [according to the 2014 community census, about 8% of MFA subscribers identify themselves as something other than heterosexual.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1zw25x/2014_mfa_survey_census_results/)\n\n----\n\nSide note to MFA regulars: [Read /u/rjbman's comment from way back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1hebki/top_of_waywt_june_2013/catip8q) -\n\nguys, can we please not have any negative /r/all comments? People are genuinely curious and ragging on them is not the way to make a good impression. Granted there might be a few people actually negative but it's easier to just assume everyone is curious. \n\nUpvoting this was an effort to show off the diversity of the community - let's also make it clear how welcoming we can be to folks just getting started.\n\n----\n\nAn archive for past WAYWTs can be found at [MFAWAYWT.com](http://mfawaywt.com/).

Some smaller contemporary brands use these services, but almost always get access through an intern with the subscription provided via their college. The cost of WGSN is fucking absurd. Think of an outrageous number for use on a single computer and add a zero to it. In some cases, WGSN can be $35,000 + per computer per year. \n\nLarger designers like those under LVMH, Kering, OTB, etc (speaking of actual designers and not just \"Brands\") couldn't give a fuck what WGSN thinks. They get seasonal breakdowns about performance of items and ample feedback from the world's best buyers at all of the major retailers. \n\nThe biggest users of WGSN are retailers at all price points, followed by sourcing agents and suppliers, then buyers, then brands. \n\n| Is WGSN destroying creativity?\n\nSales are destroying creativity. Sure, Hedi Slimane could throw a ton of work into designing the \"best\" collection of the season with new and exciting concepts and pieces, but at the end of the day what gets Kering their paycheck is when kids spend their lunch money on D02s, SL01s and Teddy jackets. So if Kering can print money by having eight colorways of the Teddy, do you think they're going to invest in new and exciting ideas? Nope. \n\nHell, most luxury brands do most of their sales (and I mean most as like 75%+) on handbags, perfumes/cosmetics, and small leather goods (wallets, belts).

It's in their best interests to keep fashion and trends highly dynamic so as to sell more clothing every year. \n\nThis is why there has been a big pivot towards japan. 10 years ago, nobody wanted or cared for Japanese clothing brands. Hell, you might have even got laughed at. But these larger companies saw how dynamic japan's trends are and are attempting to emulate it. Where a trend may last 1-3 years here in the US, Japan's trends can last for as little as a few weeks.\n\nMy japan tangent aside, my point is forecasting and predicting *organic* trends are ridiculous. It's a sham. Whether you'll be wearing skinny ties or fat ties next year, skinny jeans or baggy jeans 2 years from now are being decided in a boardroom among fashion professionals and big wigs. Then smaller fashion companies take their cues from the larger companies or they risk being left behind, or worse, black balled. These multimillionaires and billionaire investors aren't leaving their money to chance, they're going to decide (or rather, hire people to decide) what's hip and \"in\" because that's a sure thing.\n\nI've sat in on a few of those meetings (over a large conference call).\n"], [-6, "[removed]"]], [[{"comment": "[WGSN Modern Men's Style Tribes](https://imgur.com/a/Kj5cA)\n\nedit: [more](http://imgur.com/a/ORPXb)", "id": "danrrfn"}, {"comment": "Jesus, those profiles are cold blooded AF.", "id": "dansfyz"}, {"comment": "they have to be. there's no room for subjectivity when it comes to fashion trend forecasting.

Some smaller contemporary brands use these services, but almost always get access through an intern with the subscription provided via their college. The cost of WGSN is fucking absurd. Think of an outrageous number for use on a single computer and add a zero to it. In some cases, WGSN can be $35,000 + per computer per year. \n\nLarger designers like those under LVMH, Kering, OTB, etc (speaking of actual designers and not just \"Brands\") couldn't give a fuck what WGSN thinks. They get seasonal breakdowns about performance of items and ample feedback from the world's best buyers at all of the major retailers. \n\nThe biggest users of WGSN are retailers at all price points, followed by sourcing agents and suppliers, then buyers, then brands. \n\n| Is WGSN destroying creativity?\n\nSales are destroying creativity. Sure, Hedi Slimane could throw a ton of work into designing the \"best\" collection of the season with new and exciting concepts and pieces, but at the end of the day what gets Kering their paycheck is when kids spend their lunch money on D02s, SL01s and Teddy jackets. So if Kering can print money by having eight colorways of the Teddy, do you think they're going to invest in new and exciting ideas? Nope. \n\nHell, most luxury brands do most of their sales (and I mean most as like 75%+) on handbags, perfumes/cosmetics, and small leather goods (wallets, belts). If I'm throwing $1 million into a season, why on earth would I do so on interesting avant garde pieces that are \"changing Fashion\" when I can throw it all into something like accessories with a GMROI three times higher?

So forecasting only helps small \"fast-fashion\" brands who do not necessarily want to experiment and rather would have a tried and tested formula on which they can make profits based on volume ? ", "id": "dao1gz3"}, {"comment": "Not at all. Forecasting is actually incredibly vital, but not in the ways discussed in the OP which were almost entirely directed about brands and designers using them to define their aesthetic and seasonal styles. \n\nBuyers at all forms of retail organizations across all prices use forecasts, whether done through their own organization or through a subscription service like this. This allows them to develop their merchandising plan (size ranges, color options, etc) well in advance of the products being available for purchase at wholesale. \n\nLet's assume I'm the Head of Merchandising at SSENSE. Here's how I would start my buying process\n\n1) I establish my seasonal account balance - this includes the amount of liquid I have to spend on products for the season. This will also include the stock that I have left over (referred to as EOM stock, but in this case would be outlined as BOM stock N+1) \n\n2) I need to outline how exactly I'm going to spend this X amount of liquid asset after I remove or rollover the stock from the previous season. I'm going to look at my sales figures from the previous season to determine which items I believe will sell well. If i know my buyers are going to appreciate having every Saint Laurent denim and boot in stock in all colors and all sizes, I place this as a high priority. All of these \"top sellers\" will be moved onto my inflexible stock sheet or rollover stock sheet to ensure I cover them within my budget\n\n3) After I have my must buys, I now look at the rest of the liquid I have to determine how I can spot fill my assortment. This is where trend forecasting becomes vital. I need to have my assortment plan completed before I even view the shows to ensure I'm meeting with the right brands providing specific styles my buyers will appreciate - a forecasting service is going to tell me exactly what I can expect to see, whether it be with the rise of bondage elements, or broadcloth suiting as minor elements, or American Midwest as a broad theme. This allows me to properly create placements for items I believe but do not know will sell well. \n\n4) I view the shows, mark my intended buys on a nightly or hourly basis and when I meet with the brand determine if the pricing style will allow me to generate enough profit on the piece to work with my specific retailing style. Changes are made to my assortment plan based on these factors and my buffer room (the space I leave on my assortment plan for \"special\" or eye catching items I did not intend on buying but I believe will sell) and a final assortment is sent for approval. \n\nIn summation, merchandisers and buyers need forecasting to fill in the blanks in their assortment - if possible I'm going to use sales figures to determine what is going to sell, but if not, I use forecasts. I'll never make a buy that isn't supported by either previous sales figures or with a credited forecast and I don't expect that a buy would be signed off on if I were not to have these. \n\nFurther, sourcing agents and textile mills use these forecasts to \"know\" what designers will look for which allows them to start producing these textiles well in advance of a season. The slowest part of the whole apparel complex is the production of fabric, especially when you're including the month + shipping time from China. If sourcing agents (the companies located in the U.S. that speak directly to factories in foreign countries) are able to predict what fabrics are needed in SS17, they can start making them in SS16 and ensure a proper supply. \n\nDesigner brands tend not to use these services because there is little if any benefit for them. They already have a large bank of sales figures from previous seasons (especially if they are part of one of the major parent corporations) or have access to these figures from major retailers. If they don't, they have a team of forecasters that are able to pinpoint with a much greater accuracy where their aesthetic needs to fall given how segmented the market is.\n\nMass market brands love forecasting because it allows them to determine global trends across all of the designer brands without having to attend the shows or make hires invested in the luxury industry. It is simply more cost effective to make that purchase than to have a huge team of forecasters to determine every single trend in apparel. In-company forecasting tends to work well when you have a specific niche or segment you are targeting, but not quite as well when you have to try and find \"all\" of the segments or niche markets.

K-HOLE is an agency like WGSN - they publish [issues](http://khole.net/issues/) that center on ideas they have seen popping up in culture recently. These issues identify trends, define them, analyze where they came from, what they are about, and speculate where they are going. \"Youth Mode\" is their most famous (and arguably one of the [most famous pieces of trend forecasting ever](https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/on-the-brandwagon-inside-the-weird-world-of-trend-forecasting)) because it is accepted as the origination of \"normcore\". You know, [no](http://static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/normcore-0.jpg)[rm](http://www.mensfashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/normcore-1.jpg)[co](http://stylestories.ebay.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/normcore-1.jpg)[re](https://i.imgur.com/XA3dhMV.png). \n\nBut you might notice the subtitle of that issue - A Report On Freedom. And so that's what the issue is really about, and what normcore sprung from (which I think is extremely interesting, tbh). The true idea behind Youth Mode (and keep in mind that K-HOLE did not publicize the term \"normcore\", that came externally to label what they defined) was that young people were rejecting the traditional notion of fashion as quantified \"uniqueness\" because recent trends in advertising and design had commoditized individuality. The idea being that companies and designers were peddling the ability to *buy* your personality, or that you would best be able to express your true personality by buying their items. The reaction? To reject that notion and buy things that are purposefully formless, drab, bland, million-in-a-million. Your individuality can be expressed by a conscious rejection of the things that you are *supposed* to buy to be an individual. Personally, that's why I think normcore is more [about this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d7/2f/6d/d72f6d642fc82455409b39c1d4ad5e73.jpg) than it is [about this](http://www.ixdaily.com/storage/article/3335333-ae01d5aa.jpg), which is one of those things that kind of came to be associated with normcore (and crossed over into health-goth, *fuck*, which makes me too annoyed to talk about) because Mac, whether consciously or not, is using fashion in a way that's much closer to the central ethos of what Youth Mode was about. The second example kind of just takes the very end result (wearing mass-brand logos and items, things previously considered wildly unfashionable or ugly) and applies it to something new. This is not bad, it is just not the same.\n\nWhat the normcore movement lost over time that I liked most about it was the ideology behind it, and that can be ascribed to K-HOLE. Well, the ideology itself can't be - but being able to perceive it and analyze it in a way that effectively understood what it and its denizens were about certainly was. It approached fashion and its subcultures as something less than \"the wacky stuff kids are wearing these days\". It extended clothing far beyond its reach into other artistic mediums, philosophy, advertising and the concept of how modern youth (which includes you, if you are still young) think about themselves. This is cool, to me, because clothes [are not just about clothes](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4049/4487511944_59e3f41f43_b.jpg). The reason I care about clothes is because I think the social signaling behind them is so strong, I can't help but be interested. Clothes can be a statement, clothes can be an *under*statement, an *over*statement, they can be social, political, philosophical or emotional. There is so much depth to how these cultures and subcultures develop - who they are, where they come from, what they wear (what they look like), and why they choose to join with one another. And it is the job of trend forecasters to try to pick up on these sorts of things and attach fashion-based subcultures to the political climate, popular culture, societal states, and other ephemera of the zeitgeist. (is that redundant?) \n\nTrend forecasters, in my mind, are the cultural critics of fashion, or the film critics. Not your run-of-the-mill critic, but the Susan Sontag, or the AO Scott, or the Roland Barthes - the truly academic and philosophical ones. What's interesting about this kind of criticism is that it lays in limbo on a separate layer of reality, if you want to call it that - after what has been made and before what will be made, but distinctly separate from both. Good film criticism, for instance, is not necessitated by the presence of good films. It can exist regardless of the quality of film being made. Because while film criticism is at once about the film in front of you, it is also about how it fits within the greater scope of not only the medium, but the world around. *Is this a good film? Does it utilize cinema in a way that effectively conveys meaning and emotion?* Then yes, it is a good film. *But are the emotions it conveys universal, are they relevant, are they prescient? What is the filmmaker concerned with? What makes him or her happy, wistful, angry? What are they trying to say?* Thus, a \"good film\" can be, to some eyes, worthless if it about nothing important. A film can also be noble if it isn't the best made but has something interesting to say, a unique perspective. It is this that the film critic tries to see. The idea that a film not only exists as a self-contained artistic exercise but also as a piece in flux, reacting to the world around. But the interesting thing about film criticism, as I see it, is that they must constantly lag. They can identify what is being produced, they can define it, and they can stake a claim to its importance - but it must already be made. And they can remark on what is important, where they believe the world is headed, and what film is ahead of its time. But they will not make the films of the future. It is the job of the filmmaker to do that. And they can choose to heed such analysis and agree with where it is going or they can not - it doesn't much matter, especially because critics tend to disagree with one another all the time, especially about the intricacies of things. The crux is, however, that film critics occupy a weird, alternate-dimensional space of total separation from the artistic process while being able to accurately and effectively analyze what has been created with an academic eye towards the overarching movements, feelings, and ideologies of the time.\n\nTrend forecasters essentially occupy the same space, as far as that last sentence goes. They do not design, they do not cut, they do not sew, they do not sell. They absorb and analyze. Sometimes they are right, and sometimes they are wrong. But their goal is to keep a finger on the pulse of modern culture - a massive, many-headed, pulsating behemoth of opinions, tastes, experiences and ideas - and theorize the needs, wants, and feelings of the parts within. Maybe it's too much sometimes. Maybe they're just clothes. Maybe nobody cares. Maybe you're just wearing those pants because they're comfortable. But maybe there's something that spoke to you, that bothered you, that interested you, that stuck with you, that you had forgotten about or hadn't even noticed. Maybe that thing worked its way into your mind, or your heart, or your imagination. And maybe that thing is being expressed, or reacted against, without you even knowing.", "id": "daplrmo"}], [{"comment": "There was [some discussion](http://www.styleforum.net/t/480819/random-fashion-thoughts-part-ii-a-new-hope/11880_30#post_8582700) over on StyleForum around when this first came out.

Hah.. Apparently no one here works in marketing, product development or upper management... Unfortunately, I worked in both fashion and marketing and I will tell you right now that trends are no longer organic. They haven't been for a long time. Sure, there are always a few exceptions here and there, but these big fashion and clothing companies will be deciding what is \"in\" from one year to the next. It's in their best interests to keep fashion and trends highly dynamic so as to sell more clothing every year. \n\nThis is why there has been a big pivot towards japan. 10 years ago, nobody wanted or cared for Japanese clothing brands. Hell, you might have even got laughed at. But these larger companies saw how dynamic japan's trends are and are attempting to emulate it. Where a trend may last 1-3 years here in the US, Japan's trends can last for as little as a few weeks.\n\nMy japan tangent aside, my point is forecasting and predicting *organic* trends are ridiculous. It's a sham. Whether you'll be wearing skinny ties or fat ties next year, skinny jeans or baggy jeans 2 years from now are being decided in a boardroom among fashion professionals and big wigs. Then smaller fashion companies take their cues from the larger companies or they risk being left behind, or worse, black balled. These multimillionaires and billionaire investors aren't leaving their money to chance, they're going to decide (or rather, hire people to decide) what's hip and \"in\" because that's a sure thing.\n\nI've sat in on a few of those meetings (over a large conference call).\n", "id": "daot9h0"}, {"comment": "can you expand more on your japan tangent?  why would business emulate the trends of japan when it could change wildly within a year?  do you mean to say street styles showcased here https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/5fyjjz/japan_streetstyle_people_photos_i_took_on_my_trip/ are not stylistic expressions of individuality but just another example of brain dead drones following trends?\n\nI'm genuinely curious ", "id": "daovkrf"}, {"comment": "re: \"But these big fashion and clothing companies will be deciding what is \"in\" from one year to the next\" exactly.

No synthetic fibers, just a pure wool/cashmere blend. \n\nIf you don't care as much about the fabric, you can snag a cheap 50% wool/poly coat for under $100 at pretty much any store (Amazon, Macys, etc.). But I wouldn't recommend it, as for a little more you can purchase something a bit more reputable at [BR] (http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=1051348&vid=1&pid=254326012) or [JCF] (https://factory.jcrew.com/mens-clothing/jackets_outerwear/wool_outerwear/PRDOVR~E4391/E4391.jsp?color_name=dark-camel) for between $150 and $200. With a little bit of patience, you can even reach into the upper tiers with this budget.\n\nSub-$100 coats will have ~50% synthetic fiber from fashion mall brands. Between $100 and $300 you'll get better coats from more reputable outlets that might have some synthetic material given the lower price point. From $300 to $500 you'll get the 95%/5% or 90%/10% wool-cashmere blend - the \"middle class\" of topcoats. Starting from $500 (sale) to $1000, you'll get 100% cashmere coats like [this one] (http://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/coats/navy-overcoat/J452I.html?cgid=Coats) from SuitSupply, or luxury coats made from camelhair. Over $1000 IMO and you're just paying for factory and brand name reputation.\n_________________\n\nTo put it succinctly, up to around $1000 or so you get what you pay for.   \n0-$100: poor quality (not necessarily poor/durability), poor brand reputation   \n$100-$300: so-so quality, decent/good brand reputation   \n$300-$500: good/excellent quality, good/excellent reputation   \n~$700-$1000+: good/excellent quality, luxury-brand reputation.    \n\n...And that's why J Crew is so popular around here.

", "id": "dapxmw0"}], [{"comment": "To address your experience first: Yeah, J Crew coats cost a bit because the fabric is better than the coats you'd see in the sub-$300 range. No synthetic fibers, just a pure wool/cashmere blend. \n\nIf you don't care as much about the fabric, you can snag a cheap 50% wool/poly coat for under $100 at pretty much any store (Amazon, Macys, etc.). But I wouldn't recommend it, as for a little more you can purchase something a bit more reputable at [BR] (http://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=1051348&vid=1&pid=254326012) or [JCF] (https://factory.jcrew.com/mens-clothing/jackets_outerwear/wool_outerwear/PRDOVR~E4391/E4391.jsp?color_name=dark-camel) for between $150 and $200. With a little bit of patience, you can even reach into the upper tiers with this budget.\n\nSub-$100 coats will have ~50% synthetic fiber from fashion mall brands. Between $100 and $300 you'll get better coats from more reputable outlets that might have some synthetic material given the lower price point. From $300 to $500 you'll get the 95%/5% or 90%/10% wool-cashmere blend - the \"middle class\" of topcoats. Starting from $500 (sale) to $1000, you'll get 100% cashmere coats like [this one] (http://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/coats/navy-overcoat/J452I.html?cgid=Coats) from SuitSupply, or luxury coats made from camelhair. Over $1000 IMO and you're just paying for factory and brand name reputation.\n_________________\n\nTo put it succinctly, up to around $1000 or so you get what you pay for.   \n0-$100: poor quality (not necessarily poor/durability), poor brand reputation   \n$100-$300: so-so quality, decent/good brand reputation   \n$300-$500: good/excellent quality, good/excellent reputation   \n~$700-$1000+: good/excellent quality, luxury-brand reputation.    \n\n...And that's why J Crew is so popular around here.
