The world is a big place and I promise you there's something better than food out there for you :). The other commenters have great ideas about this.\n\n2) My personal rule is that I have to work off anything I eat, which doesn't rely on motivation as much as it does discipline. I think you'll find the latter is far more useful to cultivate. Before eating anything, I always ask myself if I can spare the time to eat this - not just the five minutes it takes you to eat those nachos but the hour of sweat and hard work running it off.

Eating smaller portions more often so you don't hit a feel hungry lul and keeping good snacks on hand for when you do. Exercising for fun instead of punishment. Find a way to make it fun, only watch your favorite show or listen to your favorite pod cast while exercising. All small steps that should be taken over the course of *years*, not weeks or months and one at a time so you can focus on learning how to do it as a passive choice before you learn how to incorporate the next change into your life. \n\nDoing the I'm going to starve myself plan is setting yourself up for failure because we don't make good decisions when we are deprived of the things we need. At some point you find yourself so hungry that you make bad food decisions every time you are hungry because it feels like an emergency. So you make or eat the quickest thing on hand and quick on hand foods usually aren't good choice foods. Then you feel bad for eating the bad food again and shame yourself into not eating again for a while or exercise as punishment. \n\nI've kept 70lbs off for 2 years by changing all those things one at a time.

That's a very slippery slope to a binge/purge eating disorder.\n\nFirstly, you should work on finding something that makes you feel good that isn't food.\n\nSecondly, find healthy snacks you enjoy. Always have some with you. See nachos? Eat your healthy snack. Or take one bite of nachos then eat healthy snack. That way you aren't depriving yourself but you aren't binging. And does food put you in a better mood when you haven't eaten for a bit? Consider talking to your doctor about hypoglycemia.

Something is wrong (on a genetic level) with the brains of addicts. There is a part of the brain that generates negative thoughts/emotions that becomes incredibly overactive for addicts, as proven through MRI scans of the brains of addicts. \n\nWhat happens when we get these negative thoughts and emotions is we try to push them down. We use alcohol, drugs, or food. Because these things give us a respite from the shitty thoughts or emotions. The brain is getting what it wants, and it is always 10 steps ahead of us. \n\nYou will hear this at a lot of Anon meetings: your brain is trying to kill you. \n\nYou want to quit but you can't. That is the first step (literally). You are powerless over your eating. That is the very definition of what an addict is. \n\nI have the same problem. I tried to white knuckle it.

The very first day the stories you will hear will resonate and it does not matter what the drug of choice is. The content of everyone's story is different, but the themes, what underlies them is always the same. That alone provides more reprieve and peace of mind than you can possibly imagine. \n\nWhat this does is build you a support structure. It surrounds you with people who understand. I have already lost 35+ pounds of my \"relapse\" weight. And this time I actually have hope because I now have a framework of support. \n\nedit: and to explain a bit of my backstory - I thought I built a solid support group of friends and family. The problem is after a year and a half that started to crumble. Some friends relapsed and got unhealthy for me to be around, others vanished from my life, family members had their own problems. Anon groups provide that support structure and people can come and go from it, while the group as a whole stays intact.

I've weighed more or less what I've weighed since high school (I'm a fairly small woman, currently right in the middle of the \"healthy\" BMI range), but for a long time I struggled with an eating disorder, in part because I wasn't able to retrain myself *not* to like food. I tried *hard* to dissociate myself from having any kind of emotional attachment to eating, but unfortunately, some of us are wired to feel good after eating nachos or a delicious kale salad or a tasty yogurt. Some people just *like food*, and that's okay.\n\nWhat helped me learn healthier habits was this: I just don't have to eat all of it. I started really listening to my body and obeying my hunger signals instead of eating just to finish something because I paid for it (or didn't) - making peace with leaving food on my plate at the end was kind of a game-changer, since I grew up poor and in a clean-plate house.\n\nYou don't have to go all the way to the side of \"food is fuel, not fun\" to have a healthy attitude toward eating. Reddit is super over-the-top about this. Develop the habit of mostly eating healthy food in moderate amounts, stop when you've had enough, allow yourself to eat the nachos or the cheeseburger and then have some vegetables at the next meal because your body needs them.

Balance and moderation is key to so many things.", "id": "dahlozw"}], [{"comment": "**Food is complicated.**\n\n*EDIT: Normally I don't speak about nutrition on the internet - because it is a very controversal topic - but I have the feeling the people here are more appreciative.*\n\nI self-studied the past 8 years nutrition (& exercise) in my leisure time and if I think back to the beginning - where I had no clue - I often feel really dump and embarrassed, because now it feels like one of the most logical things in the world. Even if I went through a kind of struggle with a really \"hard\" *(hard is maybe the wrong word here)* learning curve. Sometimes it wanted to make me quit and just eat the \"normal\" bullshit, but then there was finally this \"click\" moment and now it feels just normal.\n\nWhat most people have to learn on the path to their \"perfect\" diet is the struggle through \"food-I-cannot-live-without\" to \"healty-food-I need-but-is-not-my-taste\" and \"media-does-often-not-tell-the-truth\" *(there are a lot of myths out there)*.  \nFor example: I LOVE nutella. To avoid a nutella massacres, I enjoy every weekend some small nutella pancakes *(ingredients are only eggs and banana)*.  \nAnother example: I HATE vegetables, but they are VERY healthy. So I figured out what vegetables are tasting okay and which way of preparation I enjoy the most. I don't like most vegetables cooked, so I enjoy my carrots, cucumber and pepper with some quark for example.\n\nI bet everybody heard about counting calories who would like to change their body. And of course that is true, but it is not only the calories that are important but also what you eat. In my experience a lot of people are eating in their calorie range, but are always hungry, which then often leads to ravenous appetite attacks.  \nA lot of people probably heard that you have to eat enough proteins to feel filled and that sure is true, but also a lot of people eat too little dietary fiber - one of the most underrated nutrients - which makes you feel filled too! So pay an extra attention on that too, not only the calories and/or macronutrients.\n\nThere goes a lot of other things into \"dieting\" and \"eating healthy\". A good point to start is the wiki over at /r/fitness.  \nBut basically mix healthy with dirty food everyday and you can still be healthy and feel happy at the same time!\n\nAnd here are **my most common \"cheats\" for tastier healthy-meals**: \n\n- Try to replace common ingredients with a low-calorie variants (for example: cream with low-fat cream/milk) \n\n- Make your meals more tasty with some sweetness (like honey/fruits for oatmeal) or dips (like yoghurt dressing for chicken-salad, low-sugar ketchup for pasta)\n\n- Bonus: Coke zero instead of normal coke - because I love Zero :)\n\nPlease don't take this as an \"advice\" and rather as direction pointer to encourage people to research these things for themself and find their own way. Thanks.\n\n*EDIT2: You don't have to exercise to cut weight or eat healthy. But exercising is not only healthy in general, but also lets you control your hunger!

This has worked wonders for me, especially these snacks, have been a godsend for me: http://www.plant-based-power.com/kopi-af-snack-rugbrod\n\nAlso psychologically, your bummed out feeling and self-medication (the crappy food) might come from a message from your subconscious, that you are not actively engaged in your optimal potential (perhaps you already know what it is you are thinking about wanting to pursue). Actually the negative consequences of not fulfilling ones potential, can be as severe as those from terribly situations.

The reason I had used was because as a young child, I was dealt bad cards in life. My way of escaping was through narcotic drug use. It began at the age of 9 and lasted until I was 23. \n\nThroughout my childhood and early adulthood I pushed the limits of the human body through drug consumption. I honestly don't know how I am still alive, I don't say that lightly. I've eaten grams of molly, almost killed myself 2 handfuls of times with xanax. At age 23, I was hopeless, without a college degree, and having never really amounted to anything lasting. I'll never forget the day when I pondered on my life, and thought to myself, \"I'm 23 and I didn't fulfill my deepest desires in life,\". Since I was young, I wanted to be either a lawyer. or a programmer. Those were my childhood dreams. I cried every night, and in the daytime I sucked back the sobs to keep a strong face in front of my peers. I hadn't been living true to myself.\n\nThe suffering I experienced throughout my life is hard to explain, it has lead me to think, feel deeper, but it has also put me at odds with others. It's a quiet sort of suffering. I feel that I am on a different level than most people. I often push the limits on what I can do physically and mentally. My body and thought are representative on that philosophy. I'm extremely fit, and extremely intelligent. \n\nI often wonder if I was given an advantage in life via my past, despite it being ugly and dark, because I function at such a high level. It puts me at odds with those who are content with where they are in life, but I realize they don't have the engine that I was gifted. I don't see this life as a place to meander around in. I have huge ambitions to change the world. I'm currently working on a host of websites for my city to help the forgotten people of my society. That is the start of my legacy. I have an extremely big heart.\n\nBefore I left the rehab, I told my counsellor about my desire to enroll in college. The man smirked at me as if I didn't have it in me. I'll never remember the day when he said, \"You're going to relapse if go to college, it's what happens to all drug addicts,\". I love when people tell me I can't do something. The next few months of my life were spent deep in thought. I'd ask myself, \"What do I want to do with my life?\". \n\nOccassionally, I would be blessed with visitors that were extremely intelligent in their field. Those were the best days at the rehab, when I could have deep conversations  with intelligent people and pick their brains apart. Most of my housemates were already planning on living simple lives after leaving, but I was dreaming big. I had lived a surpressed life up until now, and it was like my ambition was exploding out of me. I don't have any limits as far as my capacity. I can always learn, adapt, and overcome. I read a box of books whilst there. I challgened my brain daily, to read, and to focus. Mostly psychology books, my favorite was \"A Road Less Traveled\". I became a fiend for knowledge. I had spent all my life beating around the bush, doing what was easy. Now it was finally time to turn a new chapter in my life. I needed a challenge, and a dream to keep my spirit alive. In all honesty, I had felt dead my whole life. I spent every morning meditating for 15 minutes, envisioning my future. This next chapter of my life was about challenging myself. \n\nOnce I left the rehab I made several sacrifices to achieve my dreams of being a top-notch learner. I quit social media, stopped having negative people around me, and lived a life in the pursuit of knowledge. I also had very little friends for quite some time, as I adapted to my new lifestyle.\n\nIn January 2016, I enrolled in school with my brain not having fully recuperated from the drug haze. It was a challenge, and I suffered a lot. Despite having took 16 credits and completed it with a 4.0, I questioned my ability to finish school. I felt I could do better by improving my study techniques, my rate of information absorption, all these variables of things I could do better (I often find ways of doing ANYTHING better, now that I think of it).  My mind would want to give out. \n\nI trained myself to do what I called \"math olympics\" or \"mental gymnastics\". I would do math for 8 hours straight, sometimes longer. I got 100% on my tests (I still do this to this day). I started rewiring my pain and reward system. Fitness was my reward, study was the pain. I worked harder than anyone else in the classroom. I graduated my first semester with 3 98%'s, and 2 97%'s. Suffering had been such an integral part of my life, except now the reward wasn't being stuck in a rehab. It was a letter that symbolized hard work and dedication that I could use for entry into a graduate school. \n\nI spent countless nights staying up studying, and often dreamt about how I would show the world that even a once destitute person can achieve highly. I wasn't the first, but I'd make myself a notable addition to the list. Further, I'd be able to share my story to those who once felt hopeless. I could connect to them by saying, \"I was once in your shoes,\". Pain and suffering is an integral part of my success. I ended up leaving all my classmates in the dust. I'd often find it difficult to even talk to them, because I knew I would more than likely not be there anymore. \n\nSimply because I had lived, my insight was farther reaching than any of my classmates. This propelled me lightyears ahead, in terms of intellect and grades. Just a year before, I had been in a rehab. Now I am top of the class, in every class.

A lot of this abuse is of children - human beings least capable of defending themselves against such behavior. Those who survive it, come to live a life where the pain is not merely a memory but a scar that will never heal, and the problems it will cause are not immediately addressable with a pep talk or a cheer-up.\n\nEstimated [350 million people](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/) worldwide - more than the US population whole - suffer from depression. This means anything from feeling like shit to being unable to complete basic domestic chores because you lack energy or desire so much you can barely think about doing it. Sometimes, you can barely lift your own body, but you keep walking with a smile because you can and because you don't want people to worry about you. Sometimes, all you can do is lie in bed for hours because nothing seems joyous and nothing seems to give pleasure - not even the simplest things like the Sun, a good song, a good meal or a breath of fresh air.\n\nI could go on - oppressive governments, struggling artists, people forced into pooly-paying labor due to the whole world relying on the products produced by your country - but I'm sure you see my point by now. There are far more than the two umbrella and exclusive types of suffering that you've listed, each valid on its own merit. But you indulge yourself in the first-world flavor of self-deprecation, equal in magnitude of taste only to the first-world problems themselves. Both are infinitely more appealing than acknowledging that people have deep inner worlds of their own, rich or poor, some of them - deeper than yours because of what they've been through. You have it good, and the others should have it terrible - or they might as well not exist at all.\n\nThis is not a way to treat other people - not with the entitlement that you say to loathe. We each live in a different world, and while some kinds of pain are deeper than others, they're all equally real. What to you may seem a petty struggle, to another may be a completely new experience that they aren't prepared for.

I am a five-time felon. The reason I had used was because as a young child, I was dealt bad cards in life. My way of escaping was through narcotic drug use. It began at the age of 9 and lasted until I was 23. \n\nThroughout my childhood and early adulthood I pushed the limits of the human body through drug consumption. I honestly don't know how I am still alive, I don't say that lightly. I've eaten grams of molly, almost killed myself 2 handfuls of times with xanax. At age 23, I was hopeless, without a college degree, and having never really amounted to anything lasting. I'll never forget the day when I pondered on my life, and thought to myself, \"I'm 23 and I didn't fulfill my deepest desires in life,\". Since I was young, I wanted to be either a lawyer. or a programmer. Those were my childhood dreams. I cried every night, and in the daytime I sucked back the sobs to keep a strong face in front of my peers. I hadn't been living true to myself.\n\nThe suffering I experienced throughout my life is hard to explain, it has lead me to think, feel deeper, but it has also put me at odds with others. It's a quiet sort of suffering. I feel that I am on a different level than most people. I often push the limits on what I can do physically and mentally. My body and thought are representative on that philosophy. I'm extremely fit, and extremely intelligent. \n\nI often wonder if I was given an advantage in life via my past, despite it being ugly and dark, because I function at such a high level. It puts me at odds with those who are content with where they are in life, but I realize they don't have the engine that I was gifted. I don't see this life as a place to meander around in. I have huge ambitions to change the world. I'm currently working on a host of websites for my city to help the forgotten people of my society. That is the start of my legacy. I have an extremely big heart.\n\nBefore I left the rehab, I told my counsellor about my desire to enroll in college. The man smirked at me as if I didn't have it in me. I'll never remember the day when he said, \"You're going to relapse if go to college, it's what happens to all drug addicts,\". I love when people tell me I can't do something. The next few months of my life were spent deep in thought. I'd ask myself, \"What do I want to do with my life?\". \n\nOccassionally, I would be blessed with visitors that were extremely intelligent in their field. Those were the best days at the rehab, when I could have deep conversations  with intelligent people and pick their brains apart. Most of my housemates were already planning on living simple lives after leaving, but I was dreaming big. I had lived a surpressed life up until now, and it was like my ambition was exploding out of me. I don't have any limits as far as my capacity. I can always learn, adapt, and overcome. I read a box of books whilst there. I challgened my brain daily, to read, and to focus. Mostly psychology books, my favorite was \"A Road Less Traveled\". I became a fiend for knowledge. I had spent all my life beating around the bush, doing what was easy. Now it was finally time to turn a new chapter in my life. I needed a challenge, and a dream to keep my spirit alive. In all honesty, I had felt dead my whole life. I spent every morning meditating for 15 minutes, envisioning my future. This next chapter of my life was about challenging myself. \n\nOnce I left the rehab I made several sacrifices to achieve my dreams of being a top-notch learner. I quit social media, stopped having negative people around me, and lived a life in the pursuit of knowledge. I also had very little friends for quite some time, as I adapted to my new lifestyle.\n\nIn January 2016, I enrolled in school with my brain not having fully recuperated from the drug haze. It was a challenge, and I suffered a lot. Despite having took 16 credits and completed it with a 4.0, I questioned my ability to finish school. I felt I could do better by improving my study techniques, my rate of information absorption, all these variables of things I could do better (I often find ways of doing ANYTHING better, now that I think of it).  My mind would want to give out. \n\nI trained myself to do what I called \"math olympics\" or \"mental gymnastics\". I would do math for 8 hours straight, sometimes longer. I got 100% on my tests (I still do this to this day). I started rewiring my pain and reward system. Fitness was my reward, study was the pain. I worked harder than anyone else in the classroom. I graduated my first semester with 3 98%'s, and 2 97%'s. Suffering had been such an integral part of my life, except now the reward wasn't being stuck in a rehab. It was a letter that symbolized hard work and dedication that I could use for entry into a graduate school. \n\nI spent countless nights staying up studying, and often dreamt about how I would show the world that even a once destitute person can achieve highly. I wasn't the first, but I'd make myself a notable addition to the list. Further, I'd be able to share my story to those who once felt hopeless. I could connect to them by saying, \"I was once in your shoes,\". Pain and suffering is an integral part of my success. I ended up leaving all my classmates in the dust. I'd often find it difficult to even talk to them, because I knew I would more than likely not be there anymore. \n\nSimply because I had lived, my insight was farther reaching than any of my classmates. This propelled me lightyears ahead, in terms of intellect and grades. Just a year before, I had been in a rehab. Now I am top of the class, in every class.

Picture yourself as fully developed in that field. If it's \"Singing\", imagine yourself with music flowing through you. If it's \"Writer\", imagine yourself weaving worlds and words and feeling the exhilaration.\n\nLet's say the answer is \"Writing\". Place the winner (\"Writing\") on top, and the loser (\"Singing\") below it.\n\nPick up another pair of two notes, such as \"Public Speaking\" and \"Dancing\", and do the comparison between those two. Which makes you happier? Alright, \"Dancing\".\n\nNow you have the following leaders: Writing & Dancing. And the following losers: Singing & Public Speaking.\n\nKeep doing this until you have a row of winners and a row of losers. Those are your Tier 1 and Tier 2 choices.\n\nNow pick up two of the Tier 1 winners and repeat this process again, to create an even higher tier of winners.\n\nRepeat it until you're left with one winner. _That_ is your greatest passion.\n\nIf you want to find your second greatest passion, just repeat the process with the remaining notes, and so on.\n\nIt's called a Tournament Sort.

It's the post-processing that makes all music sound interesting. Pure acapellas are always a bit dry and boring. So don't compare yourself dry to other people's finished songs.

If that.\n\nThat's the problem with everyone who says \"it took me 5 years to get good\". No, it _didn't_. It took you _5 years of mostly doing other shit_.\n\nYour voice is at the \"6 months of actual work\" mark.\n\nHere's some encouraging math:\n\n- 2.5 years = 30 months.\n- 30 months = 900 days.\n- \"Thirty minutes to an hour of practice a day\", \"if that\", should be an average of 35 minutes considering all the days you skipped because you were out with friends, busy in school, relaxing, etc.\n- 900 days * 35 minutes on average = 31500 minutes.\n- 31500 / 60 = 525 hours of actual practice.\n- 525 hours = ~21.8 days of total time.\n- But the good news is that your practice wasn't high-quality in the beginning, so really, you're more at the ~15 days of total \"quality practice time\" mark.\n\nIsn't that _encouraging_? To realize how little time it actually took to get to where you already are. Just imagine where you'll be soon! And now you'll just keep getting better and better, faster and faster since you've started getting results and are finding it more joyful; you aren't holding yourself back with as much self-doubt, and you are finally extending your practice sessions _and_ getting _higher-quality_ practice.\n\nHere's the good news: You are getting there! You're past the beginner's hump stage and you're starting to feel the freedom of being able to do what fills your lungs with air. You are _finally_ doing the right thing! Daring to commit. You're kicking ass right now! Keep it up! You can achieve all of your dreams in this lifetime! :-D There's no reason to quit! You're awesome! Do it do it do it Tempesthe Dragon! :-) Keep going and keep being awesome! You're doing it. It's finally happening! :-) You are the one! Yep, YOU.

Good luck and have fun on your ride! :-)", "id": "daodd2c"}, {"comment": "By the way, I am vanishing from Reddit now to return to my own life so I won't be seeing any followup questions. Therefore I just want to wish you the best of luck with everything. You're in for a lot of fun! :-)", "id": "daoer0f"}, {"comment": "Firstly, thank you so much for getting back to me. I wasn't expecting this at all. Thank-you so much for your encouragement, Dext! It made my day. I didn't know what to expect when opening my inbox, but it wasn't this. \n\nI understand I made a good few... hiccups in the singing. But eh, it's a process. \n\nAnd you didn't put it harshly at all. You were simply stating the facts. I had figured I wasn't practicing as much as I should have last month. It scared me to think I have been wasting so much time. But I need to put that all behind me. Instead of thinking about who I could have been, I want to focus on who I can be in the future. Who I will be. \n\nSetting a weekly goal and writing down my practice time really helps. If I skimp out one day, I look at what I did the day before: \"30 minutes of drumming - 30 minutes of singing\" and think: \"Stop being lazy. You're kidding yourself if you can skimp out today. You need to manage your time better. Blah blah blah.\" \n\nI tell myself a lot: \"Don't give up what I want now for what I want most.\" \n\nI want to be a great singing drummer the most but right now I want to scroll FaceBook or Reddit. \nSo I try to weigh what I want more. \n\nProcrastination is a part of me I'll always have. I can't conquer it 100%... I can only manage it. \n\nAnd I'd like to expand on what you wrote to me:   \nI'll be graduating H.S. in 1.5 years, so IDK what \"real life\" (dead-end job, etc) will make my schedule look like so here it is.\n\n1.5 years = 18 months. \n18 months x 4 = 72 weeks \n\nHopefully I can start practicing 18 hours a week (schedule varies on school days. But on Saturdays and Sundays I might be able to juice out 4 hours. 1.5 hours of singing and 2.5 hours of drumming.) \n\n72 weeks x 18 hours a week = 1,294 hours of practice time.\n\nSounds great? Not so fast, Miss TempestheDragon. \n\nWinter Break \n1,294 - (18 x 2) = 1260 \n\nDays I don't want to practice - 200 hours per year... or more.\n\nStill, seeing this math here makes me think. 1,060 hours of practice in 1.5 years is much better than 525 years of practice in 2.5 years.\nAs for taking drumming lessons for the past year, it might equal something like: .75 hours (45 mins on average) a day x 300 days a year = 225 hours. \n\n525 + 225 = 750 total in 2.5 years. Which is STILL a good deal less than what I could be in 1.5 years. \n\nSadly, 1,000 hours in 1.5 years = 650 hours for drumming (I tend to drum more than sing) and 350 hours for singing. (Ouch...)  \nBut still... it's better than it was before. \n\nIn my experience, practicing can vary from day-to-day. Good days, bad days, etc. But seeing this math in front of me reminds me who I could be one day. Who I could be... sooner than later.\n\nIf I follow through on this. \n\nBut anyway, I'm kind of rambling right now. \nFeel free to follow me on SoundCloud. I'll be posting a video of myself singing/drumming (or hopefully) doing both at the same time each month. :) And I'll be more than happy to get back on any feedback you give me. \nI've also got a Christmas song in the works, so you can look out for that as well. :D \n\nBut if you don't mind, is there anyway you can share the edited Castle On A Cloud in a different format? I can't seem to open it in that link you sent me. Maybe MP3 could work. \n\nAnyway, thanks again, Dext! I was really touched by your reply. \n\n", "id": "dapefdk"}, {"comment": "Hey again, maybe you missed the other message above (since it was a self-reply), where I explained that I've left Reddit. But I logged in one more time since I realized you may have left a message.

No, you were having fun weren't you? Then it's not wasted time. Life isn't meant to be a big, tedious chore. I would say you made the _best_ use of your time: Having fun and being young.\n\nYou talk like musical practice is some kind of strict military work. It's clear that you're beating yourself into something that doesn't feel comfortable. Doesn't that make you wonder why you're even doing it? Why punish yourself like that? It can only lead to pain and increasing regret.\n\nStop _all_ aspirations about making money from it or becoming a great musician _right now_. That's the #1 reason people quit. They set a super high goal and push themselves so hard that _every_ session feels like an impossible chore, and then they quit because _no_ human can take that kind of discouraging self-abuse. It associates internal pain and negative emotions with what should be fun and carefree. Each session becomes increasingly painful, and they decide to procrastinate instead, to avoid the pain. Stop hurting yourself like that. The _surest_ way to associate _pain_ with music (and to _fail_) is to try to force yourself to be a _paid_ musician after school - and after you've deeply associated _pain_ with music then you'll _never_ find the joy required to be able to _progress_ far enough to _ever_ earn money from your music.\n\nFix your skewed goals right now. You _aren't_ making music for _other_ people. That's _not_ what creativity is about. Do it because it's fun to _you_ and because you love expressing the creativity inside you. You can't force creativity. Don't force yourself to divide the time X and Y ways. Don't force yourself to do it at certain times of the day. Don't force yourself to do the math to find some \"optimal schedule\". The math was just meant to show you that it doesn't take as long as you thought, and that you have infinite time to relax and have fun! Just relax now and do _whatever_ feels right at the moment each day. The more you relax, the more you'll enjoy relieving the creative itch with music instead of idly browsing Facebook. Spread your practice out in smaller chunks throughout the day to make them manageable (instead of massive timeblocks that you will procrastinate). Learn to get started when you should and rest when you should. And try to find friends who want to work with you on music, and start producing and recording together, just for fun. Relax and stop caring about the mistakes or your progress. Relax and your progress and motivation will come _naturally_. Let go of all pain and fear and you'll actually relax enough to start having _fun_ with music. And ironically, when you drop all self-imposed pressure to \"succeed\" (whatever the hell that means), _that's_ when you'll _actually_ find the joy and freedom and motivation to be able to progress far enough to _become_ a great musician and to have a chance to even earn money someday.\n\nBy making music for yourself _because it's fun_, you'll associate _happy_ feelings with music, and you'll soon enjoy it _much_ more than Facebook. Wherever it goes from there, doesn't even matter. Who cares if other people listen to or like your music? Why should that matter at all? The point is for _you_ to have fun in life, isn't it? So start there. Have fun with music for your own reasons, without depending on other's approval. Then, boosted by the joy of creating and learning, you'll be able to keep going and progress faster and faster the more you learn, and will achieve _creative fulfillment_ (which is all that truly _matters_) - and as an added _bonus_ you'll even be able to reach the skill required to be able to earn money from music. :-)\n\nSo start by fixing your goals to one thing: Your _new_ measure of success from now on should be to _have fun_. That's all that matters in life. Everything else will work itself out from there.\n\nAnd stop listening to idiots who say that \"it takes 10,000 hours\" or other bullshit like that. That's a completely bullshit \"soundbyte\" and a _total_ myth which has been proven _wrong_ by _everyone_ who _refused_ to let _others_ tell them what _they_ can or cannot do. Don't let others impose _their_ limits on _you_. It takes _one_ person two weeks and _another_ one 60 years, because one is feeling passion and joy and the other is feeling pain and torture and constant self-doubt. The main factor in learning _isn't time_. It's the _quality_ of their time: https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/22/daniel-goleman-focus-10000-hours-myth/. It takes 10 hours of passionate and fun learning over 500 hours of feeling that something is a painful chore. One is high-quality learning, and the other is torture.\n\nFurthermore, stop worrying about \"perhaps having a deadbeat job\" after school. Uhm. That's a clich\u00e9, and _no_ job is a hindrance to making music. You aren't at work _all day_, right? You have afternoons and evenings and weekends. Work is no different than the amount of time you already spend in school _right now_. No matter _what_ job you have, you'll find time to make music. Let music be your loving hobby. Let work be your work. And if you _keep_ making music because you _love_ it, you'll _one day_ be able to find a way to earn a living from it.\n\nWill it happen after school? Maybe. Maybe not. Does it _matter_? _Not at all_. If you think it matters then you've got a very bad idea of what \"success\" is in life. Self-torture _isn't_ success. What matters in life is _you_ being happy and building a loving family and having loving friends. Happiness and love _doesn't_ come from what you _do_. It comes from _who_ you _are_ as a person. And all of that is _free_ and you can have it _right now_. You do _not_ need music or some \"future accomplishment\" as a way to prove your worth _today_. You're _already_ perfect.\n\nOh and here... watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHnIJeE3LAI\n\nI wish you all the best in life, Rachell. :-)", "id": "dapk0cb"}], [{"comment": "Very inspirational!

We might haunt ourselves with thoughts like \"if only I put in more effort when I was x age\" completely ignoring other circumstances that might have contributed. Our priorities, motivations and views of the world were different in the past, for valid reasons, and so there's no point in wishing we saw things differently in the past.

(I ate out a lot...)\n\nTo sum up the above, start reducing the sneaky and unnecessary fatty/high calorie/high sugar contents of meals and start adding healthier ones.\n\nMy Fitness Pal app has been a great way to track what I'm eating and let's me see how it all adds up.\n\nDrink all the water. Yes, you're going to pee all the time, but, you'll be flushing toxins, allowing your organs to do their jobs so much easier which helps you achieve your goals faster, you won't be as hungry, you will feel full faster, annnnnnnnd, it helps with cellulite reduction because the hydration it provides to your fat cells allowing them to \"smooth out\".\n\nSnack! The whole six small meals a day thing. I could never have an actual small meal prepared but I *could* carry a Luna Bar or some walnuts and veggie/fruit in between meals. This will make sure you aren't super hungry and overeating at meal times.\n\nRecognize when you're full. This was really hard for me because if I really enjoyed the meal I wouldn't necessarily stop eating when I was full, it was when I was bursting. Not healthy. At some point ask yourself, \"Am I eating because I'm hungry or am I eating because it's still in front of me?\" Out of site, out of mind- box it up, put it in the fridge, walk away and enjoy the next part of your day. \n\nExercise and make it fun but avoid abdominal and oblique exercises. Allow me to explain.. Pick fun activities that doesn't feel like a work out, something that's just fun. Pole Fitness classes are fantastic (as are a lot of other classes Pole studios offer ;) ) or some form of martial art like Brazilian jiu-jitsu. With Jits you'll learn great self defense skills while working up a sweat. Or, if you're interested in both, do both! Do all the fun things! \n\nTo address the ab and oblique exercises from above.. Exercises that directly affect your abs will, of course, build your abs. However, right now, that payoff isn't going to show until you lose the fat that's in front of it, it's only going to push your stomach out farther and you don't want that. Other exercises you do will work your abs ( don't completely ignore them forever, though, you want balance) so for now skip things that work them directly. \n\nOkay, obliques....  listen.. I'm all about curves I wasn't born with. Like the ab exercises, oblique focused exercises will push them out farther thus losing that feminine curve. Instead, focus on glutes, lower back, and lats for more curvy-ness. **Definitely do lower back for protection sake. I've had back problems before due to weak muscles and back pain in your 20s just isn't worth it.\n\nFlexibility work- stretching after exercise not only allows for better recovery but also more flexibility (which is nice for shaving your legs), and also allows the muscles room to grow more because they aren't as confined by tight fibers. \n\nReplenish your body. Drink a smoothie or eat a reasonable meal within about 30 minutes after a workout. This will feed your muscles and replenish lost nutrients. \n\nFeed your body. Don't you dare think about skipping a meal to cut calories, you *do* need to eat to properly fuel your body so it can do its job. Work with yourself, not against. Can't stomach breakfast?

The trim figure will come as a side effect.  So let's work out what you need to do.  Here are the 3 main parts: educate yourself, build yourself, and make it fun.\n\n**Education yourself:**\n* Let's save you sometimes: there are five parts to a fitness program: **diet**, **aerobic** exercises, **anaerobic** exercises, **rest**, and **motivation**.  Let's look at them briefly:\n\n* **Motivation**: you'll need to find ways to motivate yourself to break away from your old self to win a new self.  Don't kid yourself, this is the hardest part of the program.  Do this well and the rest are mere details.  You're smart, I'd expect you to build your support network, leave old friends with bad habits and intentions behind, and push yourself to try on new healthy attitude and practices.\n\n* **Diet**: Quality is more important than quantity.  Figure out what you need to consume.  Don't read the latest diet fad books or articles.  Read up on how athletes feed themselves.  I based my diet on the Zone Diet, old book but based on scientific research and balanced approach to food.  You might find something works better for you.\n\n* **Aerobic exericises**: do something that gets your heart rate over 70% of your max heart rate 20mins/day, regularly.  Stretching, warm-up/down time do not count.  \n\n* **Anaerobic exercises**: AKA resistance training.  You can do with weights or body-weights as long as you build muscles which burns fat.  This actually is the secret to lose weight.  Muscles burn fat all day long even when you're not working out.  \nnote: Aerobic exercises and diet will get you there with reduce fat too but with resistance training, it's like strapping a rocket to your car.\n\n* **Rest**: very important to sharpen your saw.  Do not exercise hard everyday, trust in your program and take days of rest, otherwise you get burn out.  Perhaps, when you train, go hard but only train every other days.  You need to establish your rhythm.  \nnote: all four parts needs to be worked on together.  You'll struggle with any of the components lacking.\n\n**Build your self**:  get your program together and do it.\n\n**Make it fun**: join meetups, gyms, groups, or whatever it takes to get you moving and stay with your programs.  Think about setting small goals and reward yourself.  Keep the big goals but really focus on the small victories.   This is part of your motivation program.\n"], [2, "I lost 30 pounds this year and am on track to lose more. The battle is fought in the gym but the war is won in the kitchen. You simply need to eat less. Do what I call the half meal diet, everytime you order or cook your usual meal, eat half of it and save the other half for later. You'll find no one needs the sheer portions we get in restaurants to stay healthy. "], [1, "Your beautiful the way you are, but good luck and for healthy reasons I hope you succeed "], [1, "Haha  stop eating"], [1, "I've posted this before. I counted calories. Literally everything that went in my mouth was logged and accounted for. I ate at a deficit and I aimed for an average. Use a calorie calculator to figure out how much you need. Be very realistic about your activity level. Be very realistic about your portions. I ate very simply and repeated meals so that I could easily log things. Simple meal example might be roasted chicken, steamed broccoli and roasted sweet potatoes. I realized that I could eat more volumes of healthy food. I went to bed early to avoid binging at night. Not gonna lie, went to bed hungry a few times in the beginning because I made bad choices. Lost 30 pounds this way. Saw friends trying things like juicing and chia seeds. They couldn't take off the weight. Not because those things were bad (they are not) but because they were putting extra calories in their diet that they didn't account for. You can lose about a pound or two a week this way.  I know it sounds easy on paper. I know food is an emotional thing for some. I'm in my late 40's and the health benefits are significant now.

Here are the 3 main parts: educate yourself, build yourself, and make it fun.\n\n**Education yourself:**\n* Let's save you sometimes: there are five parts to a fitness program: **diet**, **aerobic** exercises, **anaerobic** exercises, **rest**, and **motivation**.  Let's look at them briefly:\n\n* **Motivation**: you'll need to find ways to motivate yourself to break away from your old self to win a new self.  Don't kid yourself, this is the hardest part of the program.  Do this well and the rest are mere details.  You're smart, I'd expect you to build your support network, leave old friends with bad habits and intentions behind, and push yourself to try on new healthy attitude and practices.\n\n* **Diet**: Quality is more important than quantity.  Figure out what you need to consume.  Don't read the latest diet fad books or articles.  Read up on how athletes feed themselves.  I based my diet on the Zone Diet, old book but based on scientific research and balanced approach to food.  You might find something works better for you.\n\n* **Aerobic exericises**: do something that gets your heart rate over 70% of your max heart rate 20mins/day, regularly.  Stretching, warm-up/down time do not count.  \n\n* **Anaerobic exercises**: AKA resistance training.  You can do with weights or body-weights as long as you build muscles which burns fat.  This actually is the secret to lose weight.  Muscles burn fat all day long even when you're not working out.  \nnote: Aerobic exercises and diet will get you there with reduce fat too but with resistance training, it's like strapping a rocket to your car.\n\n* **Rest**: very important to sharpen your saw.  Do not exercise hard everyday, trust in your program and take days of rest, otherwise you get burn out.  Perhaps, when you train, go hard but only train every other days.  You need to establish your rhythm.  \nnote: all four parts needs to be worked on together.  You'll struggle with any of the components lacking.\n\n**Build your self**:  get your program together and do it.\n\n**Make it fun**: join meetups, gyms, groups, or whatever it takes to get you moving and stay with your programs.  Think about setting small goals and reward yourself.  Keep the big goals but really focus on the small victories.   This is part of your motivation program.\n", "id": "da97s8z"}, {"comment": "Thank you! I appreciate you taking the time to type this all out for a random stranger.

Literally everything that went in my mouth was logged and accounted for. I ate at a deficit and I aimed for an average. Use a calorie calculator to figure out how much you need. Be very realistic about your activity level. Be very realistic about your portions. I ate very simply and repeated meals so that I could easily log things. Simple meal example might be roasted chicken, steamed broccoli and roasted sweet potatoes. I realized that I could eat more volumes of healthy food. I went to bed early to avoid binging at night. Not gonna lie, went to bed hungry a few times in the beginning because I made bad choices. Lost 30 pounds this way. Saw friends trying things like juicing and chia seeds. They couldn't take off the weight. Not because those things were bad (they are not) but because they were putting extra calories in their diet that they didn't account for. You can lose about a pound or two a week this way.  I know it sounds easy on paper. I know food is an emotional thing for some. I'm in my late 40's and the health benefits are significant now.

(it doesn't rely on a cutaway gags, those only appeared in the very early episodes) The premise of AD means the writers can do more than they could in a show like Family Guy.\n\nOne of the good things about AD is that the writing team can acknowledge when a recurring gag or joke doesn't work, and will drop it rather than trying to keep forcing it. One example is that the show was intended to be more political, and you can see that in the first season where Hayley and Stan argue more frequently, and more of the episodes have political overtones/inspiration. Obviously that never went away entirely, but they did shift focus to other things as well. (speaking of political humor, they're also pretty good at doing that without being preachy. They could have easily turned Hayley into Brian, treating her like the \"voice of reason\" in a sea of crazies and having her always be right. While there are times when she acts as a voice of reason, there are many other times where she is crazy as well) In early seasons, Klaus had a crush on Francine, but this kind of went away since it just wasn't funny. Another early on thing was that Roger didn't do much since he so rarely left the house, but having him start wearing lots of disguises and creating personas meant they could do much more with him.\n\nThe AD writers are also very good with continuity, something you don't see in a lot of animated sitcoms. It's not like I demand continuity in shows like these, but I do appreciate it, you know? Maybe it creates more of an investment in the show or something. And a lot of the continuity stuff isn't even in-your-face, sometimes it's just hidden in the background where only a regular viewer is going to get it.\n\nThe meta humor is also really good in AD, which is impressive since meta humor can be tricky to pull off well.\n\nCleveland Show was definitely an FG ripoff. Kind of a shame that they didn't try to do anything new with it.

Focus on other pursuits and chances are those pursuits will be interrupted by a woman who wants you in her life.\nOn being too nice: Ever heard the expression \"nice guys finish last?\" it's true. It's true because while everyone likes a nice guy, few people respect a nice guy. In our world nice people are treated as a resource and often times they end up getting used quite badly. Needy people will use you as a dumping ground for their emotional problems. False friends and opportunists will use you for what they can get out of you. Lazy people will use you to do things for them and make their lazy lives even easier. In short, people will use you to enable their own desires and then not give a fig for your desires because the do not respect you. When you ask them to give back, they're gone. When this happens, it's tempting to see these sorts of people as malicious, antagonistic people who are willfully using you up, but the truth is that if you are universally nice and accommodating to everyone you meet, if you are bending over backward to please everyone, then you TEACH these people to take advantage of you. Needy people will learn that it's okay to dump on you. Angry and frustrated people will learn that it's okay to abuse you when they have to let the poison out. False friends will learn that it's okay to use you without fear of reproach. Lazy people will learn that it's okay to off load their own work onto you. And women will see you as weak and too accommodating (and weakness, real or merely perceived is a major turnoff for most women). But you can't exactly blame them, for the nice person who just wants to be helpful and friendly with everyone often ENABLES this poor behaviour and sets himself up for one disappointment after another. People are hard-wired to exploit every advantage they can perceive and to use up every resource they can find. Don't get used up!\nA good way to avoid this situation is to remember another old saying: \"You do it once, it's a favour; you do it twice, it's your job.\" Being the nice guy and doing nice things is more than fine, it's a requirement of any properly functioning society, but it's also okay to say no, to leave people displeased if the things they expect from you are inconvenient or will cost or harm you - after all, being nice is not your only job in life, you also have to look after yourself and get some of the good stuff for yourself as well. So do favours - but don't do them twice, at least not in succession. Listen and counsel those around you are who are hurting, but if all they want to do is dump on you, let them know that that you are not the town's nuisance yard. If someone is using you, deny them. When you do this, even if it leads to conflict (after all, who likes to have a reliable resource withdrawn?) you TEACH people that you have boundaries and you TEACH them not to use you as a doormat. You may lose some 'friends\" this way, but the true friends who remain will begin to respect you more and everyone learns that they can't take advantage of your good nature. Setting these kinds of boundaries doesn't mean you have to suddenly become an asshole - if you are calm, honest and RESOLUTE when you set these boundaries, you will actually become a stronger, more confident, NICER AND MORE ADMIRABLE person.

This is ignorance and I would argue that this line of reasoning has led many people into consequences they regretted later in their life. However, what we are delving into or discovering here goes deeper in us as you will see. There will/have been a plethora of times in our life where we are faced with a decision where our contribution to said decision will have a certain effect. We can either remain ignorant of this idea or embrace it. Either way there will be an effect to something that we cause so  we can either be conscious of this and act in a way that we want to shape the world (be the change you want to see in the world) or be ignorant of it. Either way, it's something no one can take away from you and is part of what makes you so unique. What I'm describing here is conscientiousness; being conscious of and wishing for the ability to do what is right. Now only you can define what is wrong and right for you. So it's up to you to define those things and then act in a way that is right because it influences everything/everyone around you. \n\nI have digressed a little but I hope the point stands out. Not everyone has the same definitions of wrong or right so occasionally that means you can either let the other person input the cause for their desired effect or you can be the cause. On average people tend to trust and want to be around more conscientious individuals because you are more reliable and genuine.

Stand up for your nice behavior if you think it's the right thing to do. \n\nTLDR: do what you think is right without sacrificing your moral obligations to yourself.

My radiation treatments were so intense, that they burned off over 220 layers of skin, inside my mouth, burning off all of my saliva glands. They told me that my saliva glands would come back between one and two years. My treatments ended May 1st, 2014 and when May 1st 2016 came this summer, my saliva glands were still not back. Then I did research on other people who have had their saliva glands burned off, because of radiation treatments just like me. I found out that, one out of three patients; get their saliva glands back, when they live in a hyperbaric air chamber, for one entire month. I am a very optimistic guy, I\u2019ve been an extremely positive person my entire life, and I have always been all about Edifying others, with my words or actions.

I truly feel that every minute, of every day, of every week, month, quarter & year, is a true blessing and I am so grateful to still be here on earth with all of you! To be able to sit in the DMV, with my 16 year old son last week, for almost two hours, was completely Awesome, & I would not of wanted to be anywhere else, but right there, with him then. That's my new thing now, ever since I beat C, I always say that, \" I GET TO DO IT, and not that I have to do it.

Even though I have been very extroverted, my entire life, after loosing all of that weight +having to endure all of my horrible treatments, I have now become very recluse. But I have a nice balance now, where before I always wanted to be around others, 24/7. So it actually wasn't until I saw TCM, my Agent again, two months ago this last Sep 2016, that I started to pursue the entertainment industry once again, only because they totally encouraged me to. They asked for me to get new updated pictures taken, so they could start to market me again, like they did before me having to fight C. If it wasn't for Terri & Raelene at TCM, God bless both of these women, I may not have ever started to pursue this industry again. But now that TCM is behind me, it has helped my confidence level come back full force. Then for me to even have the energy to deal with going on castings again, & to be prepared for a bunch of rejection, I have to be strong, like I was before.

I felt like the odd one out in highschool, I didn't know what I was going to do after highschool and what to do during it. At the time, I met other people who were the same, typically party-goers or gamers, and there was a sort of ring of unconsciously keeping eachother depressed, drunk and unfulfilled (and as I've found, this is a fairly typical case). I don't know if this is your case, but it certainly was my experience back in highschool and parts of college. I met friends down the road who were much more supportive, in line with my dreams and loving as people in general. How I worked out of that was I went out on my own, really meditating on what I loved in life. I played a *ton* of videogames in my past. One thing that kept popping up as a general theme for the games I would play is that I loved to adventure around and would pick a bow as a weapon, in games like Demon's Souls or Skyrim. Turns out, I was just trying to have fun by vicariously using a bow in a game and that I wanted to experience real adventure in life. I had no idea I had a passion for archery until I took it up, or that I'd even end up carving my own bows out of wood, or that I would travel the world, backpacking and getting closer to nature and reality! Anyways, what I learned from this is that the subconscious tells you all sorts of stuff, you just have to listen to it closely enough and let it guide you towards your passions and desires. I run a subreddit where we keep our procrastination at bay while working towards skill development, and the reason why I developed it was because I have a passion towards helping people and improving myself. I would always give advice to friends and family where it was wanted, and that's why I wanted to become a counsellor as I'm passionate about leadership and self-improvement, and am on the path to doing so. There are little hints of passion everywhere in your life, you just need to listen in a little closer and pursue it with an open heart and mind. Once you find something you're really liking, I'd recommend finding a mentor on the hobby/skill whathaveyou. They speed up progress, if it's something you end up seriously wanting to develop as a skill, and can become great friends. Anyways, hope you find what's out there waiting for you."], [3, "This is a difficult question for someone who doesn't know you to answer.  What are you interested in? What do you enjoy doing?

Just like you my grades are mediocre, I'm not the most intelligent person, and i never fit in, mostly got bullied despite how friendly or normal i was.\n\nThe best thing to find a passion is to take a chance, I'm at university/college for someone that got a very bad ATAR (I'm Australian) so GPA, and eventually the dots and things connect eventually, i wanna be in senior management, i make good decisions and my passion is really to help people and coordinate people to a common goal (Leadership).

The rest of the class would switch majors or go to graduate school--which has somewhat of an image of, \"I didn't know what to do with my life so I'm just going to continue school\" (this isn't true though). Needless to say I fell into the latter category and interact with undergraduate students regularly...who of course ask me, what should I do if I dont know what I enjoy doing/passionate about?\n\nThe answer that I've come to after thinking about myself and my students for awhile is that those without a passion have just not tried enough things.\n\nLove for an activity doesnt come to you automatically just like love for a person is rarely ever true love at first sight. Sometimes you might like a person (for their looks) or an activity (popular, initially fun, etc...), but it isnt a real love or passion until time is put into it. You spend real time and effort on baseball or drawing and realize you really do enjoy it, great! But the first step is to just try it! You can never know until you do. The second step is to try more stuff! You might not find your love on the first hobby you try or first girl you date, but we keep on trying...rather than say there is nothing for me. Its rarely lack of interest in everything that results in a lack of passion, but rather just laziness or fear of putting time/effort into anything.\n\nSo just go out and try stuff! See what your friends like and see if you would be interested in doing the same things. Always more fun as a group :)!"], [1, "My honest advice right now would be: screw passion.  You're in highschool.  You, and everyone around you, has NO IDEA what they're doing, aside from a handful of gifted minds and probably some rich kids who will ride their parents' success their entire lives.\n\nBut here's some helpful advice from someone who has a few years on you:  one way to find out what you *want* to do is by doing things you DON'T want to do.  Take a lawn mowing job, if you're old enough to get on the work program, get an actual job and get to work, wash dogs, do your yard and housework for your parents, just get involved with something that forces you to do work.  You'll likely find that after the excitement of something new wears off, you'll start to daydream about the *real* things you want in life.  Once you start doing that, you'll be able to figure out how to steer yourself in that direction.\n\nGood example of that: I never knew I wanted a motorcycle until I rode one, and then drove a car to work for several years and daydreamed about being on a motorcycle the entire time.  Now I ride a bad ass harley and LOVE it every time.  Also, I never realized I loved aviation as much as I do until I had my job working on air conditioners.  I'd find myself stopping to watch every plane fly over.  A few years later, I was in aviation school.  I can now fly an airplane.  Seriously.\n\nHighschool kids are put under immense pressure these days to have their lives figured out by 18.  FUCK THAT.  I'm 30 and still discovering new things about myself, and will probably never stop.  \n\nHere is a quick list of things to get interested in though, just to maybe throw some lines out and see what bites, but are very beneficial regardless:\n\n* Work out.  Just fuckin do it.\n\n* Learn about automotive work\n\n* Learn some basics on plumbing, electrical, etc.  (Just think, you meet a girl, you go over to her house, you notice her sink leaking.  You fix it.  You just gained MAD respect from her entire family.  They're used to douchebags that listen to terrible music, all of the sudden she brings a damn handyman home.  You're in.)   \n\n* Think of some topics you're interested in, and seek out unique books related to it, then read them.  It's become a game to me, to find that perfect Lovecraft compilation or that elusive Viking culture book, or that specific book written by a WW2 ace from a specific squadron in a specific plane.  All of that has shown me a lot about my own interests.\n\nHope this helps!"], [1, "As soon as I saw this post I knew I had to respond. I really connect with this and I hope I can provide some awesome insight and I would love to continue to have a conversation about this.\n\n\u2028\u2028After going through a lot of the answers that people have provided I feel even more compelled to connect to this post and to you, I hope to connect with the people responding to this as well. I appreciate all the responses to your question, however many of the answers actually discouraged me and I think are unhelpful.

They can be thought of as really nice ideas but theres nothing that allows someone to apply these things to your life. \n\n\u2028\u2028Take some time to be alone with your thoughts and think about the person you want to be and the live you want to have. I take time for myself every day, sometimes it is the majority of the day if I need it to be. This should not be a depressing or straining task, figure out who you want to be then be it. Figure out the live you want to create for yourself and then create it. If you want to find something to do you will. If you want to find a hobby you will. What I mean by this is do not be afraid to be yourself. Be your true self. In my life I often realize that I am not achieving my full potential because I am doing things for the wrong reasons. For example we often do things because we think there is, \u201cone right way,\u201d however this is a fallacy, it\u2019s a lie we tell ourselves just to keep going in life. You have to find the \u201cyou way\u201d to do things. The you way, is the right way. \u2028\u2028\n\nOn the surface level I will say don't underestimate the power and value in connection with others. I love opening up to people. If I am having a crisis, that\u2019s part of who I am and I am not ashamed of that. Then when I share that with others I often find that other people are going through a lot of the same things. If if you don't connect, that\u2019s fine too. Friendship is incredibly valuable, but not everyone is going to connect with you on a deeper level. So find the people who support you and you support them. \u2028\u2028\n\nOn a deeper level, the only way to find ourselves is to search. You will hardly ever find something if you are not looking for it. This leads me to say, make sure to be your own friend to. Make sure to show yourself love and do the things you need to do. \u2028\u2028I\u2019m currently publishing writings on this topic, and I could include a ton more personal information but I\u2019ll pause here and wait to see responses and thoughts. \u2028\n\n\ntl;dr There is no \u201cright\u201d way to do things, there is only the \u201cyou\u201d way.

All the way up to graduation in 2015, so I was already doing the things I love to do, socialize, network, listen to music, coordinate parties and people, drink, drugs, love, care for and support other people. I too was thinking just like you though. It was until late august 2016 that I decided to not go to community college for my sophomore year. I told my mom, \"I really don't want to go to school. I'd rather LIVE life than to study life...\" it was hard for her but I also told her that \"I'm not just going to be sitting on my ass.\" But secretly that was almost my plan, just because I didn't know what to do with my life just yet. Then three days later I met my current mentor who's been instrumental in my beginning career. I'm starting to create my own company that produces, enhances, and coordinates music events. I have my very first music fest in which I hand picked all the performers, 14 people, I created the name, located the venue, and I am still spending a lot of money to make my dreams come true. I've always have been going to festivals and concerts since middle school. So as you may imagine, I've been doing my passion since day one; I can go into more details about exactly how I've been accidentally doing my passion since day one. \n\n\"Opportunity if often disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat.\" - Napoleon Hill\n\nLastly, find out what you will ALWAYS love / like... for me it was partying and music. So becoming an event coordinator is literally all about partying and music. Fucking literally. It hasn't hit me yet that I'm actually doing my dream job. It'll hit me once the day of my music fest is finished that late night into the morning. \nIf you don't know exactly what you love, then make the topic very broad and very general. Don't make it hard on yourself.  NOw let's say for some reason you can't think of what you've loved since day one, if that's so, then that probably means that you don't know yourself yet. Knowing yourself is extremely important to finding your passion big dawg. The start of all pure natural success is knowing yourself. \"The start of all success is with desire.\"- Napoleon hill. Keep in mind that having a burning fiery desire for something can literally drive you to what ever you want in life. God I hope you read this comment and take something for it or reply. I think I can relate to you on so many levels because I used to think exactly the same thing 3 months ago. . .

At the time, I met other people who were the same, typically party-goers or gamers, and there was a sort of ring of unconsciously keeping eachother depressed, drunk and unfulfilled (and as I've found, this is a fairly typical case). I don't know if this is your case, but it certainly was my experience back in highschool and parts of college. I met friends down the road who were much more supportive, in line with my dreams and loving as people in general. How I worked out of that was I went out on my own, really meditating on what I loved in life. I played a *ton* of videogames in my past. One thing that kept popping up as a general theme for the games I would play is that I loved to adventure around and would pick a bow as a weapon, in games like Demon's Souls or Skyrim. Turns out, I was just trying to have fun by vicariously using a bow in a game and that I wanted to experience real adventure in life. I had no idea I had a passion for archery until I took it up, or that I'd even end up carving my own bows out of wood, or that I would travel the world, backpacking and getting closer to nature and reality! Anyways, what I learned from this is that the subconscious tells you all sorts of stuff, you just have to listen to it closely enough and let it guide you towards your passions and desires. I run a subreddit where we keep our procrastination at bay while working towards skill development, and the reason why I developed it was because I have a passion towards helping people and improving myself. I would always give advice to friends and family where it was wanted, and that's why I wanted to become a counsellor as I'm passionate about leadership and self-improvement, and am on the path to doing so. There are little hints of passion everywhere in your life, you just need to listen in a little closer and pursue it with an open heart and mind. Once you find something you're really liking, I'd recommend finding a mentor on the hobby/skill whathaveyou. They speed up progress, if it's something you end up seriously wanting to develop as a skill, and can become great friends.

Needless to say I fell into the latter category and interact with undergraduate students regularly...who of course ask me, what should I do if I dont know what I enjoy doing/passionate about?\n\nThe answer that I've come to after thinking about myself and my students for awhile is that those without a passion have just not tried enough things.\n\nLove for an activity doesnt come to you automatically just like love for a person is rarely ever true love at first sight. Sometimes you might like a person (for their looks) or an activity (popular, initially fun, etc...), but it isnt a real love or passion until time is put into it. You spend real time and effort on baseball or drawing and realize you really do enjoy it, great! But the first step is to just try it! You can never know until you do. The second step is to try more stuff! You might not find your love on the first hobby you try or first girl you date, but we keep on trying...rather than say there is nothing for me. Its rarely lack of interest in everything that results in a lack of passion, but rather just laziness or fear of putting time/effort into anything.\n\nSo just go out and try stuff!

You, and everyone around you, has NO IDEA what they're doing, aside from a handful of gifted minds and probably some rich kids who will ride their parents' success their entire lives.\n\nBut here's some helpful advice from someone who has a few years on you:  one way to find out what you *want* to do is by doing things you DON'T want to do.  Take a lawn mowing job, if you're old enough to get on the work program, get an actual job and get to work, wash dogs, do your yard and housework for your parents, just get involved with something that forces you to do work.  You'll likely find that after the excitement of something new wears off, you'll start to daydream about the *real* things you want in life.  Once you start doing that, you'll be able to figure out how to steer yourself in that direction.\n\nGood example of that: I never knew I wanted a motorcycle until I rode one, and then drove a car to work for several years and daydreamed about being on a motorcycle the entire time.  Now I ride a bad ass harley and LOVE it every time.  Also, I never realized I loved aviation as much as I do until I had my job working on air conditioners.  I'd find myself stopping to watch every plane fly over.  A few years later, I was in aviation school.  I can now fly an airplane.  Seriously.\n\nHighschool kids are put under immense pressure these days to have their lives figured out by 18.  FUCK THAT.  I'm 30 and still discovering new things about myself, and will probably never stop.  \n\nHere is a quick list of things to get interested in though, just to maybe throw some lines out and see what bites, but are very beneficial regardless:\n\n* Work out.  Just fuckin do it.\n\n* Learn about automotive work\n\n* Learn some basics on plumbing, electrical, etc.  (Just think, you meet a girl, you go over to her house, you notice her sink leaking.  You fix it.  You just gained MAD respect from her entire family.  They're used to douchebags that listen to terrible music, all of the sudden she brings a damn handyman home.  You're in.)   \n\n* Think of some topics you're interested in, and seek out unique books related to it, then read them.  It's become a game to me, to find that perfect Lovecraft compilation or that elusive Viking culture book, or that specific book written by a WW2 ace from a specific squadron in a specific plane.  All of that has shown me a lot about my own interests.\n\nHope this helps!", "id": "daags4x"}, {"comment": "What do you mean learn automotive work?", "id": "daah59a"}, {"comment": "Just learn how to work on cars at a basic level.

For example we often do things because we think there is, \u201cone right way,\u201d however this is a fallacy, it\u2019s a lie we tell ourselves just to keep going in life. You have to find the \u201cyou way\u201d to do things. The you way, is the right way. \u2028\u2028\n\nOn the surface level I will say don't underestimate the power and value in connection with others. I love opening up to people. If I am having a crisis, that\u2019s part of who I am and I am not ashamed of that. Then when I share that with others I often find that other people are going through a lot of the same things. If if you don't connect, that\u2019s fine too. Friendship is incredibly valuable, but not everyone is going to connect with you on a deeper level. So find the people who support you and you support them. \u2028\u2028\n\nOn a deeper level, the only way to find ourselves is to search. You will hardly ever find something if you are not looking for it. This leads me to say, make sure to be your own friend to. Make sure to show yourself love and do the things you need to do. \u2028\u2028I\u2019m currently publishing writings on this topic, and I could include a ton more personal information but I\u2019ll pause here and wait to see responses and thoughts. \u2028\n\n\ntl;dr There is no \u201cright\u201d way to do things, there is only the \u201cyou\u201d way.

And I work 5 days a week (always night shifts after I get out of school)\n\nI have two days \"off\" where I only have to go to school and I don't have to work during the nights. This is the time that I choose to do my schoolwork. I suppose I could have a more active social life if I wished, however, I'm rather antisocial and tend to stay away from people. \n\nI do still have time to see my best friend from time to time.. Although I have to say, I don't see her as much as I would like to. And it really only leaves me enough time to spend time with a few friends. If you have a bunch of friends you see and hangout with regularly, prepare to see them less often. This wasn't a problem for me, but I can see how it would upset somebody who enjoys seeing people on a regular basis. I still have an alright amount of time to do school work, but luckily school comes easy to me and I don't have to devote too much time to homework and studying. I also have time to workout 3 times a week, see my family, and have down time; just in shorter intervals. \n\nI get an average amount of 7 hours of sleep every night, and even get to sleep in occasionally (meaning 10am instead of 7) However, if you plan on going out after work or having more of a social life, you'll probably get less sleep than me. \n\nIf you try to stay organized and plan ahead for time to do whatever you want, it's really not too bad. Like I stated earlier, I really enjoyed all of my free time and was considerably lazy before.. But I'm still alive, and surprisingly still sane (whatever that means). The first few weeks were stressful, but after I got into the groove of things I began to wonder how I spent so much time doing absolutely nothing before. It just seems boring to me now. \n\nHope this somewhat helped, don't worry! If things get tough employers are usually very understanding, and schools have LOTS of resources to help you succeed. It's all about reaching out and asking for help. \n\nSorry for the lengthy post! Just trying to be thorough. Good luck!

You just do it. \n\nSource:  I have four kids, two undergraduate stem majors, regularly scheduled kid things three times a week, and two part time on campus jobs.  \n\nYou have to have a sense of how long it takes to do things and plan accordingly.  Each course for my full time semester takes a certain amount of time both attending class and doing the out of class homework and studying.  I take a good guess for the outside of class work and I schedule that into my day, every day, including weekends.  Looking at my class schedule for the semester I then see where I can fit my TA work and research in.  I log about 15 to 20 hours per week at that.\n\nThe kids have their things in the evening so their schedule does not impact what I do during the day.  Dinner has to happen so that's generally planned out a week in advance when we shop for groceries with something in the crock pot at least once a week if not twice a week.  The kids also contribute to basic chores such as doing dishes, sweeping the floors, vacuuming, and doing their own laundry at the appropriate scale for their age and maturity levels.\n\nThe hardest thing is planning for commuting time.  You never know for sure how traffic is going to be, so you plan to leave well before you need to get somewhere.  The further away you are, the more leeway you need. \n\nAfter that, I plan breaks.

But there is one thing that never dies: the fame of a man and his deeds\". \n\nFrom this point forward, your life goal is to live well and earn good fame for yourself.  You are your deeds.  If you sit around and do nothing, you are nothing.  If you stick to your word, get up and achieve, prove to be reliable, courageous, and wise, you will earn the respect of your fellow man.  To do this, think local.  Don't try to change the world.  Get up, clean your room, clean your house, clean your workspace, dress well, groom yourself, help your family succeed.  Take the trash out, mow the lawn, do the dishes, do them *before* you're asked.  These things will get you in the habit of *moving*, and from there you will stay in motion.  If you're already doing these things, (and be honest with yourself, *are you really*?), then just realize that you are and be PROUD of it. \n\n*****************************************************************************\n\n**Workout:**  I've always been scrawny, and didn't like going to the gym due to lack of confidence and results.  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FGee4kQHEY) turned it around for me.  Basically, don't set goals.  Don't look at the scale, don't look at the mirror, don't count your carbs.  Don't set weight lifting goals.  Just go to the gym at least 3 times a week.  Do a total body workout.  You're not trying to get ripped, you're not trying to lose weight, you're just working out.  Work hard at it.  Shoot for 3 sets of 8 reps per exercise.  Shoot for between 5-8 reps, and lift weight heavy enough that you can either barely finish the 8th rep, or you can't even get it.  This is the workout I do:\n\n* Leg press (or squat)\n\n* Deadlift\n\n* Bench Press\n\n* Dumbbell row (left arm 8 times, then right arm 8 times=1 set)\n\n* Overhead Dumbbell Press\n\nSimple, straight forward, covers the basics, and fairly quick (around 45 minutes total).  If I have time, I'll do the row machine for a 500 meter sprint or one more round of dumbbell rows but at a lighter weight with more reps.  This workout won't have you feeling overwhelmed or intimidated, or have you trying to remember which workout on which day and where was it and blah blah blah.  I just do this workout Mon, Wed, and Fri.  On my lunch break.  It works pretty much my whole body, has greatly improved my posture, my stamina, my strength, my *confidence*, etc etc.  It has been a HUGE positive change in my life.  What helped me get there in the first place was I was hurting myself at work trying (having) to lift heavy objects, I got tired of being scrawny, and my attitude change (what I call the Heathen mindset) greatly showed me the need to be fit.  Since then I've been going steadily, and am stronger than I've ever been.  I used to could barely max my own body weight (145 lbs) on bench press one time, now I'm repping (a total of around 24 times) my new body weight (155lbs) and am ready to go up another 5 lbs.  It has seriously worked immensely for me in every way.  You HAVE to do it, but you WILL NOT do it right unless your mind is right.  Once you feel that need to be fit, for real, you will be in there doing it.  Screw whatever everyone else thinks or says.  Who cares if the guy next to you is doing more than double what you are, *you're* getting stronger for *yourself*.  If you're working hard, you're making gains, screw everyone else.  Focus on form more than weight, don't let the guys benching multiple 45 plates intimidate you.  If you have to start out with just 25s on the bar and you can't finish all 8 reps, that's ok, you're doing it *right*.  Just make sure your form is good or you'll hurt yourself/not actually make gains.  Getting in the gym is pivotal to your self confidence, and even though it's one of the hardest things to get into, JUST DO IT.  Remember, you are your deeds.  Don't be weak, be strong by PROVING it to yourself.\n\n*****************************************************************\n\n"], [9, "go to the gym. not even kidding.

I learned it while I was in the military, and it has forever changed my life.  The super short version is this, and this is assuming you're not *clinically* depressed:\n\nEvery single thing you have to do is a stressor.  EVERYTHING.  Brushing your teeth, putting on socks, changing a lightbulb, taking a test, etc etc.  Each stressor is a \"block\".  Somewhere within you, you have a \"stress threshold\".  As those stressor blocks pile up, they get closer to your stress threshold.  This line is invisible, but if it is crossed by stress blocks, you enter into depression.  \n\nAnxiety, acne, weight gain, high blood pressure, lack of sleep, these are all actual PHYSICAL symptoms of stress.  They are your body warning you to handle your business.  If you *don't*, your body will say, \"Ok, we're done, screw it, shut it down.\"  and you'll enter into depression.  No energy, no drive, just lay there and rot.  Your body is trying to save itself from the stress by not doing anything.  Problem is, the stress keeps piling on.  It's the same way your body works say if you're trapped out in the freezing cold.  At first your body tells you, \"Hey, it's cold outside.  Here, feel these chill bumps, start shivering, etc etc.\"  If you don't get warm in time, eventually your body will start shutting down extremities in an effort to save the vital organs.  But this may render you incapacitated, and you'll eventually freeze to death.\n\nSo what do you do about it?  HANDLE YOUR BUSINESS.  They always ask, \"How do you manage stress?\"  And dumb people say \"Sex.  Working out.  Playing video games.  Yoga.  Squeezing a ball.\"  If you were *financially* stressed, you had NO MONEY to pay your bills, and some guy walked up and said \"Hey, if you give me $200, I will teach you yoga and you'll feel better about your financial stress.\"  what would you say?  You'd tell him to kick rocks.  So why would you do it with actual stress?  Yoga doesn't remove stress blocks.  Neither does sex, or running, or shooting guns, etc.  The only way to manage stress is to MANAGE it.  \n\nMake a list, either physical or mental, of *everything* that is a stress block for you.  Work orders, daily chores, tests, vehicle inspection, etc.  Now, look at that list and say, \"What can I take care of *right now*?\"  Then, take care of it.  Those stress blocks will be GONE.  You ever wonder why people say they feel better after they mow the lawn, or paint the house, or clean their room?  It's because they DID SOMETHING.  They literally *removed* stress from their life.  Gone.  And their body knows it.  Sure, it may or will come back, but when it does, do it again.  Simple.  Just handle your damn business.  I've been doing this for years now and have yet to be overwhelmed, anxious, etc.  I just have a list of daily maintenance chores that I just do, both at home and at work, before I do *anything* that would distract me.  Do the dishes, do the laundry, do the yard if it needs it.  Forget facebook, forget video games, forget everything.  Just handle your business, your load will be lighter, and you will have time/will have *earned* rest.\n\nThe only other technique you might would want to practice in addition to the stress management is something I call \"Special Forces Focus\".  I call it that because I heard it's what spec ops guys do to focus during a mission, whether that's true or not remains to be determined.  Basically, whatever your task is, ONLY FOCUS ON THAT.  It is the ONLY THING THAT EXISTS.  If you decide, \"I'm going to mow the yard.\"  DO THAT.  \"Oh, but the car isn't pulled in yet.\"  Screw the car, do that AFTER the lawn.  Right now there is only the lawn.  Wife asks you to take the trash out?  After the lawn.  It will help you gain control of your life, will help with time management, help with *confidence* (because you *know* what you're doing, you're certain of it), will help with organization and productivity, and it'll ensure a task gets COMPLETED.  Stress block gone, move on to the next one.  From what I've seen/heard, it's how spec ops guys focus during extremely chaotic situations.  \"The only thing that exists is kicking this door in.  Screw the grenades going off, the bullets whizzing by, the screaming and yelling.  Kick the door in.  Okay, the door's kicked in, now the only thing that exists is clearing this room...\"  Just use that technique to knock out stress blocks and you'll always be under control and confident about your situation.  I use this the most when dealing with work orders.  I treat each one as a stress block, and because of it, I'm always relaxed while my co-workers are sweating bullets because they've let them pile up and now don't know where to start.  I always know exactly where I am.\n\nIf you want, I could go into the stress/depression management stuff more, but since your post is about building confidence, just do what I've said.  I'm in my 30's now and I've NEVER had self confidence my entire life.  Now I do, but I *earned* it, so I can easily say it's well deserved and *real*.  Even though it's just mundane stuff, it has gotten me in a confident mindset, so now I'm doing more and more, and am anxious about less and less.  I don't even get social anxiety anymore, because I feel *good* about where I'm at.  If someone makes fun of me about something, I literally laugh it off, because I know the truth about myself and don't worry anymore what people think as a result.  It just doesn't bother me.  I think that is true self confidence: nothing rattles me because I'm secure in my *life*.\n\nHope this helps!", "id": "daaeblr"}, {"comment": "This. This will definitely help me out. I needed this.

So for long decades I was having idolizing fantasies with father figure friends - but those guys never wanted to give closeness (hugs), so I was finding myslef in gay venues and I needed some extra drugs (alcohol not being my staff it was grass) to be able to accept sex too. Because i did not like sex with men. (Laer I forced myself to therapy and married a woman and had children, but then I stopped any sexual encounters.) I still had those intensive demans of closeness , so I went to fulfill my fetishist desires on porn sites- but I disliked the humiliation 8of feeling compulsion to do it.) So I went to therapy and was finally able to stop this unwanted behavior. I realized I was probably asexual - and also that if I ask for hugs without sex it can be attained. I discovered self help groups where it is natural to talk about my need of touch without sex as a childish residue - and I did build up a few close friendships on these lines. So now I do get touching and caressing - consequently I do not feel I am lacking something. My previous way to achieve \"acceptedness\" was to create art work. Now I slowly stop that kind of activity. When I went to the anti-addiction self help groups my goal was to learn an abstinent  way of life  where I am fulfilled and serene - so as I should be able to say goodbye to life when the time comes.

I loved animals, but being a vet seemed like it would be depressing. I loved biology and genetics, but, when I finally visited a lab, I realized how absolutely mind numbing the work would be. I couldn't really just focus on what I was \"good\" at, because I was of a decent skill level in just about every subject. \n\nI loved video games, they were a large part of my life, but I never considered a career in them. I just literally didn't think about it existing. \n\nWhen I started applying for colleges, I just figured I'd go into biology, since it was a subject that seemed like it would always be interesting. During one of my interviews with a college, they suggested I study engineering, because I talked about little projects and items I had put together since I was a child. Sounded good enough to me, so I applied to study engineering there. \n\nMy first semester, I was required to take a computer science class. I loved programming, it was a ton of fun. In fact, I considered changing my major from Engineering to CS. I even picked up the major change form. However, I was intimidated out of it. Everyone at this top tier school who was majoring in CS had been programming for years. Even my boyfriend at the time, who was majoring in Engineering, had been paid to write programs for Texas Instruments. I felt I had missed that ship, so I stuck with Engineering. \n\nThe summer before my senior year, I got really into League of Legends. So into it, I decided to cosplay my favorite character and document the process of creating the costume. This was back in 2011, so there hadn't been much cosplay for the game yet, and the thread about the costume blew up. I went from just a LoL player to a \"personality\" of LoL overnight. \n\nI got friend requests in game left and right, and I accepted a number of them. One of these friend requests was from a guy who started chatting with me. Little did I know that he was a Rioter (well, for the first week or so). We ended up hitting it off and, luckily, my college was near Riot's office. I got a tour of the office and met a ton of other developers.\n\nAnd I suddenly realized that game development was a potential career path. \n\nI had already been taking courses like Cost Estimation and Modeling and Project Management in college, so I figured I could be a Producer in games. I worked for weeks on my application to Riot and sent it in. Went through the entire interview process and really rocked it. Got an offer to start shortly after I graduated as an Associate Producer. I was beyond excited. While my peers were still job searching, I had locked down a position at Riot! \n\nThe person who hired me left Riot, my boyfriend was fired, and some other nonsense right before I was supposed to start. \n\nI received an email to schedule a call before I started and planned a time. No call. Then, less than 36 hours before I was supposed to start, after I had moved and signed a year lease, I received an email revoking my offer. \n\nI was beyond crushed. \n\nNo money, huge debt, year lease, no job. I worked my ass off until I found a contract job at a biotech start up. That went well enough, but it was far below reasonable salary for the work and required me to commute 3 hours a day in LA traffic, so I kept job hunting. Finally found a job at another biotech company up in Seattle. \n\nI started there on their mechanical/industrial engineering team. I busted my buns to be invaluable to the company. It paid off, because when my role started ramping down, I asked to join the software team. My boss loved me, so he put me to the test... making mini games to judge the cognitive abilities of children to determine if they were concussed. \n\nIt was perfect. \n\nIn my spare time, I went to every single game dev event I could get into: Steam Dev Days, GDC, local mixers. I found a local indie game studio that needed a producer, so I programmed for my biotech job during the day and helped organize and run the game dev team at night. \n\nEventually, I started applying for every single game development job I could find. \n\nAnd I didn't get a single callback. Not one. \n\nI was a mechanical engineer turned self-taught programmer with no experience in games, and not as bright-eyed and bushy tailed as fresh college grads with CS degrees. It was hard to get any company to give me serious consideration. \n\nMy boss in biotech was fired and replaced by a guy who wouldn't give me the time of day and didn't seem to be very fond of women in tech. My female coworker quit and I, the last female employee, was fired shortly after ( [more details about that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2ouxv8/women_who_work_in_a_maledominated_environment/cmqwnbw/) ). \n\nI wanted, more than anything, to work in games. \n\nI figured the best way to earn and prove I had the experience necessary was to make a game, so I started working on that. It was intended to be a project to teach me the ins and outs of game development while building my resume. It turned out to be fun and wildly popular, so I put all of my savings into making the game. I hired artists, I hired audio engineers. \n\nA year and half later, we had a successful Kickstarter, raising $65k. I worked non-stop to get media coverage for the game, my team and myself, while doing everything I could to progress the industry. \n\nI was asked to join the board of IGDA Seattle. I spend a few hours a week at a non-profit helping high school students make video games. I've written articles and created dev vlogs. I've written about and interviewed by GeekWire, Venture Beat, Wired, and more. Heck, I even had my own TV episode covering my first time exhibiting my game at PAX!\n\nWhen I go to events now, people I've never met introduce themselves to me to talk about an article I've written or work I've done. \n\nSo, here I am, pursing my dream of getting into games by running my own studio. I probably won't make a profit off of it, but I'm doing what I love and I'm setting myself up to continue to do so, even thought it often felt like the entire world was against me pursing game dev. \n\nThe hardest thing is keeping myself happy and motivated, though. I'm barely scraping by, when I could have continued working in biotech or pure programming and be making 6 digit figures. I sometimes wonder if I chose the wrong path or if people are just being nice to me because they feel sorry for me. \n\nOne foot in front of the other, though. I'm going to finish this game and then see where the winds take me. "], [7, "I can lucid dream not very well though, it takes some effort.

Only had a year left. I had given up my desire to ever have children because I knew it wouldn't have been a smart choice with my current partner. \nSince I was 13 I've had this best friend. He and I clicked the moment we met and just had about the most solid and best friendship you could ask for. In reality, we loved each other deeply but were always \"with\" people and too stupid (aka young and naive) to realize we could choose differently. \nWell, at some point 4 years ago... I realized that I was ashamed of the path I had chosen. Ashamed that I wasn't HAPPY and that I was wasting my life. Precious time was slipping away from me. And I had been raised better than that. Perhaps it was the point where I realized how unhappy I was and instead of being able to talk openly to my husband about it, he rejected me and I cried alone in a closet. That moment... something clicked. And I decided to choose better for myself. I wanted love, a family and I wanted a career that meant something. \nSo, I pursued divorce. Extremely painful experience but the best choice I've ever made. I started a relationship with my best friend (who also was getting divorced; being in a marriage as miserable as mine); we got married and have a wonderful marriage. I dropped out of my MBA program and got accepted into a Masters of Counseling Psychology program (this had always been my dream path and my BA was in Psychology). Another magnificent choice. I met amazing people in the program that are still in my life. I graduated after a little under 2 years and immediately got my dream job. I'm a therapist in a Pediatric Clinic. I get to work with kids and families all day. And 4 months ago I gave birth to the second greatest love I'll ever know, my son. \nIt hasn't been easy at times... but then again, staying in a life of misery would have been much, much harder.

I am also not working with a nutritionist and a therapist (to deal with me using food as a way to deal with my emotions).

I first traveled internationally at age 22 when I graduated college - 3 weeks in Europe.  I wanted more so next summer I spent 3 months.  I was hooked. \n\nProblem was that I was in professional school and had another 3 years to go. I started hating school and my life because I just wanted to be out wandering the earth.  I grinded it out but then I was 26 and broke with a lot of debt.   \n\nI gave myself a deadline of age 30.  I worked 2 jobs, upwards of 100 hours a week at times.  The money didn't take too long, but I got a little greedy and a little distracted.  Bought a house, bought a car, invested in retirement accounts to the point that I never really ever had a large chunk of cash to do the one thing I was working towards in life.  I ended up over investing and a little over spending here and there.  \n\nI decided to take a higher paying job across the country to try and really get ahead for a year (like $50k more/year).  Well that turned into 2 years due to a couple of bad decisions (financial and relationship-wise).  \n\nEventually I finally made it.  It took me 9 years of waiting patiently for my time to enjoy my life.  I sold most of my stuff, packed my bag, said goodbye to my dog (who died while I was away) and took off with a 1 way ticket to Iceland.  I lasted just short of a year after hitting europe, egypt, dubai, india, SE asia, australia, and NZ.\n\nOne problem I had was that I had built it up so much for so long that it didn't quite live up to what I had envisioned.  There was a lot of alone time which i'm not good at.  But I got to see/do more in that year then most people do in a lifetime.  \n\nComing home was hard as I had to start all over and was once again cash poor.  Had to re-purchase a car, find a job (not too hard with my degree), re-establish friendships.  It took me a good year before I was caught up on emergency fund and stable again.  I started saving for my next trip (6 months in S. America) but once again life happened (crazy stalker girlfriend, another car purchase, water damage to my house, medical bills, job loss, etc.) and instead of leaving in 2 years it got pushed back to 3.  At that point I saw a job ad for overseas and realized I would be better off just moving abroad since I hated my work hard lifestyle.  I took another 6 months off in Europe and SE Asia and moved to Hong Kong.   \n\nI'm 38 now, financially stable but not financially independent.  I'm too old and too tired to backpack like I used to.  It's shorter trips now and I have a longer term job and girlfriend possibly wife.  I still have lots of regrets I didn't see more before I settled down.  I had the money if I were to let go of my house and sell it.  I just couldn't bring myself to do it knowing it was shooting up in value.  \n\nSo in the end I achieved about 70% of what I set out to in terms of solo backpacking and it took me about 15 years to do it.  Hardest part was having to cut ties with friends, girlfriends, and pets (cat also died while I was abroad) in order to pursue my dreams.  I don't regret it, but I do regret not going for it sooner and being really focused on what I wanted. I seriously could have done it all at age 28-30 instead of age 32-35 if I just focused and didn't invest any money early on.  Looking back I wish I had done about another 6 months of travel and would have happily traded a cheaper car, less meals out, less 401k contributions to get it.  \n\nI will say that focusing on that dream meant sacrificing being with a girl that I loved and advancing my career (had I not discovered travel I would have pursued becoming board certified in my field).  I now take 6 weeks vacation per year and am going to work towards taking 12 weeks in a few years.  I still travel cheap when I go, just can't stand hotels and tour groups and all of that.  I think the amount of work Americans are required to do is the saddest part about the country.  Teacher's have it just right in my opinion.  \n\nI also wouldn't let myself be happy for a long time. I was convinced my happiness was out there somewhere else and often dismissed what was right in front of me.  In the end it's all about balance.  The one piece of advice I would give to someone who has a dream is write it down.  Write it on your ceiling so you see it every night before you go to bed.  Write it on a piece of tape and put it on your credit card or wallet so you don't spend money without thinking about it.  Get a tattoo if you have to so you can remind yourself.  Pursuit of wealth, amazing job opportunities, friends/family with financial difficulties, girls that make you feel sick when you are apart from them...these are the things that got in my way.  \n\n"], [5, "I've always wanted to be a scientist.

That sounds facile and maybe it is but in my experience the first step on any goal is the most important. Once you get going the world will sort of help you along. That also sounds odd but it's true. Most people actually do want you to succeed, up to a point.\n\nFor example, if you want to be a doctor and you're reasonably bright you'll get all kinds of support along the way. It won't guarantee success but really the hardest part of that process is committing to it and taking that first step, whatever it is.\n\nHowever, I do want to take some issue with the premise. People who are dying are hardly the most rational people. I don't think I want to take my life cues from what a dying me would suggest. People who are dying suddenly have very little long term risk because ALL of their risk has been moved to the VERY short term. So it's a lot easier to imagine taking huge long term gambles when all your long term risk is temporarily gone.\n\nIn the general course of life long term risk has to be taken into account in decisions. Your dream may be to be a doctor but you have to at least attempt to realistically assess your odds of success. The risk of trying, and failing, to get through medical school are huge (just as one example).\n\nThat doesn't mean I think fear should paralyze you but my personal experience of chasing down an unrealistic dream has taught me to look critically at the feasibility for success. Doing an honest assessment of your skills against the skills needed to progress through the stages of a final goal are really important. If your dream is to be a doctor but you get panic attacks from seeing dead bodies you may need to find another path...a path that may not match your ideal but is more attainable.\n\nThe notion of \"do it no matter what you're inherent limitations are\" is, I think, very damaging."], [4, "I wanted to be an artist (drawing comics) and in my 20's I won a drawing contest at a local paper with my friend and we drew a political cartoon that was published there for a year.

I work as a bartender in an extrememly affluent town so I put all of my money into my dream.  I set smalller goals that seemed more attainable and started to achieve them one step at a time, like setting up a website (www.darentodd.com), establishing a network of dedicated listeners, consistently engaging fans on social media and having shows in my area constantly.  \n\n\nOvercoming my fears has never stopped, theres always something new to conquer or achieve, but I found that the momentum of just starting has helped more than anything.

Hold their hand and read books to them. Just hang out really. \n\nThen I started putting myself in their shoes in my mind. We had one life to live. What to do with it. \n\nI finished college in a degree that is useless to the outside world but was valuable to me. I bought one ways to continents and couch surfed around finding great friends that I still have to this day. \n\nStarted a bunch of different business' figuring out how I could travel permanently. And then realized if I was going to spend my time doing something, it should be something I absolutely love. Something death bed me would think about.

Spent all my money on gear. Watched countless tutorials. Learned software and mixing and arranging and songwriting  Overcame mental blocks to finishing music.

Do song sprints, so force yourself to finish a song in 3 hours.\n\nWhat motivates me is choosing this as my career and then treating it as such but even moreso than that, having a plan or a goal. I was in a slump where I would finish music but then I never knew what to do with it. Knowing the different paths of the industry, choosing one, and then seeing how it goes. You learn as you go and you pivot as needed.\n\nOnce you learn production, your DAW, how to finish songs after 100+ songs, then you can stop thinking about production and you are back to square one where it is all about making good music and emotional content. *Insert Ira Glass quote : \u201cNobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me.

It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile.

LAW SCHOOLS MARKETED THIS AS *THE VERSATILITY* OF A LAW DEGREE, when in reality grads were just taking gasping for air and taking anything--AND ENDED UP IN JOBS THEY COULD HAVE GOTTEN WITHOUT THE DEGREE!\n\n**Scholarships aren't what you think they are**\n\n* You have two applying students, A and B\n\n* A is a genius with really high scores, B would be lucky to get into your institution\n\n* As the dean, or admissions, indeed your only real job is to increase the ranking of your school ( ^ ranking = ^ prestige = ^ money), or at least not let it flounder. How do you do that? Getting smarter kids to go to your school. Now, 'A' won't go to your school if he can help it--he's got the goods for a Top 14. But you really want him, so you offer him a generous scholarship package.\n\n* That scholarship doesn't come out of thin air. There is no \"Scholarship Vault\" in the back of the Dean's office. What they do is make the lower test-score kids pay higher tuition in order to subsidize the smarter kids' tuition and, ultimately, the school's ranking. They're able to do this because a) the federal government will back students' idiotic loan amounts, 2) Student A is getting a bargain, 3) Student B *thinks* he's getting a bargain when in reality he's just cattle who won't see a worthwhile Return on Investment\n\nThought grad school, in general, was a \"big, cold, system\"? Law school is an industrial sized grinder where the only output is marginally better rankings and jobless grads with $250,000 in debt.\n\nLaw schools are thirsty *whores* for any type of validation, which means \"rankings\" news. Who is the \"great decider\" of rankings? Mostly US News World Report. Think about that for a second. How much validity do you think the rankings system has when one media organization runs a monopoly on the whole thing? Go try to figure out why one school is #60 while the other is #70. Seriously, go try. Meanwhile, people are reading these rankings like they're scripture.\n\n**The Great Usefulness Lie**\n\nOne of the more recent, and clever, ploys by law schools is to sell law degrees as *versatile*\n\n> You don't see too many practicing attorneys because law is *versatile*, they're out doing a million different things, not just practicing law!\n\nNo. The chances of you getting that environmental advocacy position is nill.

Because i did not like sex with men. (Laer I forced myself to therapy and married a woman and had children, but then I stopped any sexual encounters.) I still had those intensive demans of closeness , so I went to fulfill my fetishist desires on porn sites- but I disliked the humiliation 8of feeling compulsion to do it.)

I discovered self help groups where it is natural to talk about my need of touch without sex as a childish residue - and I did build up a few close friendships on these lines.

I loved animals, but being a vet seemed like it would be depressing. I loved biology and genetics, but, when I finally visited a lab, I realized how absolutely mind numbing the work would be. I couldn't really just focus on what I was \"good\" at, because I was of a decent skill level in just about every subject. \n\nI loved video games, they were a large part of my life, but I never considered a career in them. I just literally didn't think about it existing. \n\nWhen I started applying for colleges, I just figured I'd go into biology, since it was a subject that seemed like it would always be interesting. During one of my interviews with a college, they suggested I study engineering, because I talked about little projects and items I had put together since I was a child. Sounded good enough to me, so I applied to study engineering there. \n\nMy first semester, I was required to take a computer science class. I loved programming, it was a ton of fun. In fact, I considered changing my major from Engineering to CS. I even picked up the major change form. However, I was intimidated out of it. Everyone at this top tier school who was majoring in CS had been programming for years. Even my boyfriend at the time, who was majoring in Engineering, had been paid to write programs for Texas Instruments. I felt I had missed that ship, so I stuck with Engineering. \n\nThe summer before my senior year, I got really into League of Legends. So into it, I decided to cosplay my favorite character and document the process of creating the costume. This was back in 2011, so there hadn't been much cosplay for the game yet, and the thread about the costume blew up. I went from just a LoL player to a \"personality\" of LoL overnight. \n\nI got friend requests in game left and right, and I accepted a number of them. One of these friend requests was from a guy who started chatting with me. Little did I know that he was a Rioter (well, for the first week or so). We ended up hitting it off and, luckily, my college was near Riot's office. I got a tour of the office and met a ton of other developers.\n\nAnd I suddenly realized that game development was a potential career path. \n\nI had already been taking courses like Cost Estimation and Modeling and Project Management in college, so I figured I could be a Producer in games. I worked for weeks on my application to Riot and sent it in. Went through the entire interview process and really rocked it. Got an offer to start shortly after I graduated as an Associate Producer. I was beyond excited. While my peers were still job searching, I had locked down a position at Riot! \n\nThe person who hired me left Riot, my boyfriend was fired, and some other nonsense right before I was supposed to start. \n\nI received an email to schedule a call before I started and planned a time. No call. Then, less than 36 hours before I was supposed to start, after I had moved and signed a year lease, I received an email revoking my offer. \n\nI was beyond crushed. \n\nNo money, huge debt, year lease, no job. I worked my ass off until I found a contract job at a biotech start up. That went well enough, but it was far below reasonable salary for the work and required me to commute 3 hours a day in LA traffic, so I kept job hunting. Finally found a job at another biotech company up in Seattle. \n\nI started there on their mechanical/industrial engineering team. I busted my buns to be invaluable to the company. It paid off, because when my role started ramping down, I asked to join the software team. My boss loved me, so he put me to the test... making mini games to judge the cognitive abilities of children to determine if they were concussed. \n\nIt was perfect. \n\nIn my spare time, I went to every single game dev event I could get into: Steam Dev Days, GDC, local mixers. I found a local indie game studio that needed a producer, so I programmed for my biotech job during the day and helped organize and run the game dev team at night. \n\nEventually, I started applying for every single game development job I could find. \n\nAnd I didn't get a single callback. Not one. \n\nI was a mechanical engineer turned self-taught programmer with no experience in games, and not as bright-eyed and bushy tailed as fresh college grads with CS degrees. It was hard to get any company to give me serious consideration. \n\nMy boss in biotech was fired and replaced by a guy who wouldn't give me the time of day and didn't seem to be very fond of women in tech. My female coworker quit and I, the last female employee, was fired shortly after ( [more details about that here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2ouxv8/women_who_work_in_a_maledominated_environment/cmqwnbw/) ). \n\nI wanted, more than anything, to work in games. \n\nI figured the best way to earn and prove I had the experience necessary was to make a game, so I started working on that. It was intended to be a project to teach me the ins and outs of game development while building my resume. It turned out to be fun and wildly popular, so I put all of my savings into making the game. I hired artists, I hired audio engineers. \n\nA year and half later, we had a successful Kickstarter, raising $65k. I worked non-stop to get media coverage for the game, my team and myself, while doing everything I could to progress the industry. \n\nI was asked to join the board of IGDA Seattle. I spend a few hours a week at a non-profit helping high school students make video games. I've written articles and created dev vlogs. I've written about and interviewed by GeekWire, Venture Beat, Wired, and more. Heck, I even had my own TV episode covering my first time exhibiting my game at PAX!\n\nWhen I go to events now, people I've never met introduce themselves to me to talk about an article I've written or work I've done. \n\nSo, here I am, pursing my dream of getting into games by running my own studio. I probably won't make a profit off of it, but I'm doing what I love and I'm setting myself up to continue to do so, even thought it often felt like the entire world was against me pursing game dev. \n\nThe hardest thing is keeping myself happy and motivated, though. I'm barely scraping by, when I could have continued working in biotech or pure programming and be making 6 digit figures. I sometimes wonder if I chose the wrong path or if people are just being nice to me because they feel sorry for me. \n\nOne foot in front of the other, though.

Unhappily. To a guy I shouldn't have been with in the first place. I was working at an oil & gas company where my daily routine was filled with the same tedious & useless BS.

I had given up my desire to ever have children because I knew it wouldn't have been a smart choice with my current partner. \nSince I was 13 I've had this best friend. He and I clicked the moment we met and just had about the most solid and best friendship you could ask for. In reality, we loved each other deeply but were always \"with\" people and too stupid (aka young and naive) to realize we could choose differently. \nWell, at some point 4 years ago... I realized that I was ashamed of the path I had chosen. Ashamed that I wasn't HAPPY and that I was wasting my life. Precious time was slipping away from me. And I had been raised better than that. Perhaps it was the point where I realized how unhappy I was and instead of being able to talk openly to my husband about it, he rejected me and I cried alone in a closet. That moment... something clicked. And I decided to choose better for myself. I wanted love, a family and I wanted a career that meant something. \nSo, I pursued divorce. Extremely painful experience but the best choice I've ever made. I started a relationship with my best friend (who also was getting divorced; being in a marriage as miserable as mine); we got married and have a wonderful marriage. I dropped out of my MBA program and got accepted into a Masters of Counseling Psychology program (this had always been my dream path and my BA was in Psychology). Another magnificent choice. I met amazing people in the program that are still in my life. I graduated after a little under 2 years and immediately got my dream job. I'm a therapist in a Pediatric Clinic. I get to work with kids and families all day. And 4 months ago I gave birth to the second greatest love I'll ever know, my son. \nIt hasn't been easy at times... but then again, staying in a life of misery would have been much, much harder.

I first traveled internationally at age 22 when I graduated college - 3 weeks in Europe.  I wanted more so next summer I spent 3 months.  I was hooked. \n\nProblem was that I was in professional school and had another 3 years to go. I started hating school and my life because I just wanted to be out wandering the earth.  I grinded it out but then I was 26 and broke with a lot of debt.   \n\nI gave myself a deadline of age 30.  I worked 2 jobs, upwards of 100 hours a week at times.  The money didn't take too long, but I got a little greedy and a little distracted.  Bought a house, bought a car, invested in retirement accounts to the point that I never really ever had a large chunk of cash to do the one thing I was working towards in life.  I ended up over investing and a little over spending here and there.  \n\nI decided to take a higher paying job across the country to try and really get ahead for a year (like $50k more/year).  Well that turned into 2 years due to a couple of bad decisions (financial and relationship-wise).  \n\nEventually I finally made it.  It took me 9 years of waiting patiently for my time to enjoy my life.  I sold most of my stuff, packed my bag, said goodbye to my dog (who died while I was away) and took off with a 1 way ticket to Iceland.  I lasted just short of a year after hitting europe, egypt, dubai, india, SE asia, australia, and NZ.\n\nOne problem I had was that I had built it up so much for so long that it didn't quite live up to what I had envisioned.  There was a lot of alone time which i'm not good at.  But I got to see/do more in that year then most people do in a lifetime.  \n\nComing home was hard as I had to start all over and was once again cash poor.  Had to re-purchase a car, find a job (not too hard with my degree), re-establish friendships.  It took me a good year before I was caught up on emergency fund and stable again.  I started saving for my next trip (6 months in S. America) but once again life happened (crazy stalker girlfriend, another car purchase, water damage to my house, medical bills, job loss, etc.) and instead of leaving in 2 years it got pushed back to 3.  At that point I saw a job ad for overseas and realized I would be better off just moving abroad since I hated my work hard lifestyle.  I took another 6 months off in Europe and SE Asia and moved to Hong Kong.   \n\nI'm 38 now, financially stable but not financially independent.  I'm too old and too tired to backpack like I used to.  It's shorter trips now and I have a longer term job and girlfriend possibly wife.  I still have lots of regrets I didn't see more before I settled down.  I had the money if I were to let go of my house and sell it.  I just couldn't bring myself to do it knowing it was shooting up in value.  \n\nSo in the end I achieved about 70% of what I set out to in terms of solo backpacking and it took me about 15 years to do it.  Hardest part was having to cut ties with friends, girlfriends, and pets (cat also died while I was abroad) in order to pursue my dreams.  I don't regret it, but I do regret not going for it sooner and being really focused on what I wanted. I seriously could have done it all at age 28-30 instead of age 32-35 if I just focused and didn't invest any money early on.  Looking back I wish I had done about another 6 months of travel and would have happily traded a cheaper car, less meals out, less 401k contributions to get it.  \n\nI will say that focusing on that dream meant sacrificing being with a girl that I loved and advancing my career (had I not discovered travel I would have pursued becoming board certified in my field).  I now take 6 weeks vacation per year and am going to work towards taking 12 weeks in a few years.  I still travel cheap when I go, just can't stand hotels and tour groups and all of that.  I think the amount of work Americans are required to do is the saddest part about the country.  Teacher's have it just right in my opinion.  \n\nI also wouldn't let myself be happy for a long time. I was convinced my happiness was out there somewhere else and often dismissed what was right in front of me.  In the end it's all about balance.  The one piece of advice I would give to someone who has a dream is write it down.  Write it on your ceiling so you see it every night before you go to bed.  Write it on a piece of tape and put it on your credit card or wallet so you don't spend money without thinking about it.  Get a tattoo if you have to so you can remind yourself.  Pursuit of wealth, amazing job opportunities, friends/family with financial difficulties, girls that make you feel sick when you are apart from them...these are the things that got in my way.  \n\n", "id": "daqqnih"}], [{"comment": "I've always wanted to be a scientist.

That sounds facile and maybe it is but in my experience the first step on any goal is the most important. Once you get going the world will sort of help you along. That also sounds odd but it's true. Most people actually do want you to succeed, up to a point.\n\nFor example, if you want to be a doctor and you're reasonably bright you'll get all kinds of support along the way. It won't guarantee success but really the hardest part of that process is committing to it and taking that first step, whatever it is.\n\nHowever, I do want to take some issue with the premise. People who are dying are hardly the most rational people. I don't think I want to take my life cues from what a dying me would suggest. People who are dying suddenly have very little long term risk because ALL of their risk has been moved to the VERY short term. So it's a lot easier to imagine taking huge long term gambles when all your long term risk is temporarily gone.\n\nIn the general course of life long term risk has to be taken into account in decisions. Your dream may be to be a doctor but you have to at least attempt to realistically assess your odds of success. The risk of trying, and failing, to get through medical school are huge (just as one example).\n\nThat doesn't mean I think fear should paralyze you but my personal experience of chasing down an unrealistic dream has taught me to look critically at the feasibility for success. Doing an honest assessment of your skills against the skills needed to progress through the stages of a final goal are really important. If your dream is to be a doctor but you get panic attacks from seeing dead bodies you may need to find another path...a path that may not match your ideal but is more attainable.\n\nThe notion of \"do it no matter what you're inherent limitations are\" is, I think, very damaging.", "id": "daqonsk"}], [{"comment": "I wanted to be an artist (drawing comics) and in my 20's I won a drawing contest at a local paper with my friend and we drew a political cartoon that was published there for a year.

Turns out that's actually more or less possible. Not totally, but I can get like 80% of the way there, which is enough. I'd be cool with being an in-between weirdo too (which I currently am).

I've always had a strong drive to motivate others and to see them define themselves, progress, and finally achieve their dreams. That drive culminated in writing a book 4 years ago, and this was the core premise. It was _filled_ to the brim with methods of achieving discipline, developed over the years of finding what works for people. One method per page. Hundreds of individual, motivational techniques and mind hacks.\n\nUltimately I ended up taking my own advice to such an extreme extent that I threw away the book draft to completely devote myself to my wife and family and making _them_ happy and being the _best dad_ I can be. Lots of great material was lost, but our time on Earth is limited and I figured that if most other people _can't even_ find their own discipline then why should I try to _force_ them to? There are _enough_ books that they can already read and they _still_ aren't motivated. What's another one going to do for them? So I threw it all away. ;-)\n\nIt was a pretty strange feeling, to reach the point where it all seemed so pointless. But I decided to leave the rest of the world alone. The people who _truly_ want something in life will _always_ go out and walk the necessary road to get there, and they _don't_ stop to _read_ about it. They just _do_ it. And the people who _don't_ really want it (the majority) will just keep talking about it and reading self-helps books about it. That's as far as most of them get. However, devotion isn't very complicated when you actually boil things down to the core: Throw away the books and the excuses. There's really no substitute for just shutting up and doing it. Everything else is just rationalization and procrastination, and it only fools yourself. The rest of the world can't see your internal monologue or your excuses. They see your results or lack of them.\n\nSo after deleting the massive book draft, I wrote one final page, before deleting that too.

", "id": "dane2s3"}, {"comment": "Haha, cute about the \"linter error\"!\n\nFirst off, this simple and effective filtering method was the core behind a self-help book I was writing years ago, and it was explained in much more depth there. But I explained above (in another comment) why I decided to let go of that book. I still kept this summary image, which of course had to leave a lot out (you can't fit a whole book in this image).\n\nAs for \"Destiny is used before it's defined\" - that isn't the case at all. It's in the top right speech bubble next to Mind: \"You must fully define your identity and destiny so that your two gatekeeper filters know what to aim for\".\n\nThat's the work you have to do on your own. You have to make a strong decision about what your filters are aiming for. The most effective filtering happens when you don't have to think so much, and have made a decision that won't leave any chance to rationalize and bargain with yourself. Then the work of knowing whether something is right or wrong for you becomes an easy Yes or No question.\n\n- Identity is the kind of person you want to _be_ every day. It doesn't have to mean anything vocational; this is more about personality, sharing love (or not), being disciplined (or not), and to what extent.\n- Destiny is where your heart and passion wants to _go_ in life. If you believe in predestiny, then use that belief to motivate yourself with the strong feeling that you're _meant_ to be doing something. If you don't believe in predestiny, then take control of your own destiny and create your own, and believe in your power to achieve it.\n\nAs for your question about the Physical filter, there are two aspects to it:\n\n- Creating physical barriers to prevent impulsive and lazy behavior. For example, removing yourself from toxic environments and throwing out things that tempt you.\n- But the _main_ action and strength of the Physical filter, is in _realizing_ that your body is still just acting out movement-commands from your mind. Your mind actually has the power to _stop_ all _physical_ execution, by refusing to act them out. Your mind can _hold a temptation_ that it can't stop thinking about, but can still _refuse to do it_ physically.\n\nTry this experiment: Sit down. Now think \"Get up, get up, I really want to get up, GET UP!\". But refuse to act it out.\n\nYour mind can contain a very strong impulse to do something, but it also has the power to _completely refuse_ to act it out physically, no matter how much that impulse tempts you internally.\n\nYou'll whine a bit internally and feel the impulse bouncing around, but as long as you've mastered the act of _refusing_ to turn inner temptations into physical actions, your mind's emotional whining simply won't matter.\n\nThink of it like this, if it helps: The impulse can be seen as the reptilian & limbic brain. They're responsible for your emotional, impulsive, greedy, \"me me me, give it to me now, I want it now and I don't care about future consequences!\" stupidity. The physical gatekeeper is in using your neocortex (logical human brain) to _refuse_ to carry out any physical actions:\n\nhttp://www.wakingtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ghfdhdrhare1.jpg\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n1. Decide what kind of person you want to be (Identity) and where you want to go in life (Destiny). If you make a strong decision and commit to it here, your Mind filter later will have a much easier time refusing to rationalize things away or letting things slip through.\n2. Use your Mind filter (Identity & Destiny) to logically and objectively tag an impulse as Positive or Negative, with a minimum amount of thinking. It gets easier and easier with time, as you _dare to commit to your life path_. And at its most effective, the impulse will be completely discarded at this stage and won't bounce around anymore.\n3. Use your Physical filter to _blankly refuse_ to act out the Negative impulses, no matter if you can't let go of them internally. No logical thinking is needed. It's a mere refusal to move your body in that direction. You don't have to argue internally about _anything_. You simply _refuse_ to act it out. Soon, even the strongest inner struggle will die out and give up, when your mind realizes it isn't getting what it wants. The impulse fades away.", "id": "dannldc"}, {"comment": "The book went into much more depth about how to achieve each step. One of the most important steps is identifying your Destiny (your greatest passion) and daring to commit to it, with the _sure knowledge_ that you've looked at all other life paths and _discarded_ them. Commit yourself to your _greatest_ passion, and leave the rest of the world (your \"mere interests\") to _the rest of the world_. Here's a simplified version of a very effective technique I developed:\n\n- Buy a stack of post-it notes.\n- Do a braindump where you write down every interest you have in life. One per note. \"Painting\", \"Piano\", \"Singing\", \"Dancing\", \"Drumming\", \"DJing\", \"Writing\", \"Public Speaking\", \"Programming\", \"Helping Others\", whatever it may be. Personally I ended up with 30 notes.\n- Now place the notes in front of you and pick up two at random. Such as \"Writing\" and \"Singing\".\n- Ask yourself: \"If money was no objective, and I devoted myself to one of these subjects and achieved true mastery and creative freedom in it, which one of these would make me **happiest**?\". Picture yourself as fully developed in that field. If it's \"Singing\", imagine yourself with music flowing through you. If it's \"Writer\", imagine yourself weaving worlds and words and feeling the exhilaration.\n- Let's say the answer is \"Writing\". Place the winner (\"Writing\") on top, and the loser (\"Singing\") below it.\n- Pick up another pair of two notes, such as \"Public Speaking\" and \"Dancing\", and do the comparison between those two. Which makes you happier? Alright, \"Dancing\".\n- Now you have the following leaders: Writing & Dancing. And the following losers: Singing & Public Speaking.\n- Keep doing this until you have a row of winners and a row of losers. Those are your Tier 1 and Tier 2 choices.\n- (If there's an uneven number of notes, simply look at the last one and decide whether it belongs on the Tier 1 or Tier 2 row.)\n- Now pick up two of the Tier 1 winners and repeat this process again, to create an even higher tier of winners.\n- Repeat it until you're left with one winner that ignites your heart more than anything else. _That_ is your greatest passion.\n- If you want to find your second greatest passion, just repeat the process with the remaining notes, and so on.\n- It's called a Tournament Sort. And it helps you objectively drill down to your true passion, with a very simple and fun, repeated A vs B test.", "id": "dano35e"}, {"comment": "Why do you have to commit to one thing though?

", "id": "dao21ef"}, {"comment": "It's a matter of _getting somewhere_ that you can be proud of _first_ before you start _expanding_. Getting far in just _one_ field is such a big task that most people cannot focus enough to achieve _anything_ (hence why \"self-help\" books are so popular). Trying to start from scratch and instantly get far in _multiple_ fields is even worse; that's a _gargantuan_ \"wishful thinking\" task. Don't underestimate the amount of work. Climb one _mountain_ first. Not two or three simultaneously.\n\nTrying to get far in multiple fields at the same time will shatter and scatter your available time, energy and focus, while depriving you of seeing any deep progress, and it produces the same result 99% of the time: Discouraged quitters.\n\nSo to make your life easier and ensure you'll actually get somewhere: Spend your time wisely and optimally by dedicating yourself to getting _results_ in your greatest passion. Once you've achieved what you truly wanted to do in life, you can relax and start climbing another mountain _just for fun_ to add even more skills to your belt.\n\nIf on the way up a mountain you suddenly realize that you'd rather do something else in life, then roll down the hill (quitting is easy, _most_ people do it all the time hehe) and start climbing another mountain instead. ;-)\n\nMost importantly: Have fun! And don't worry about earning an income from anything you pursue. If you devote yourself and become a master, you'll have so much fun finally being able to release all that pent up creativity.

Will everyone take it the same way? No way! But maybe it will inspire, or motivate, a few. \n\nBut I think part of the message is that everyone, which is a stretch in itself with 7B+ people in the world, has a uniqueness about them that can shared. Unfortunately some peoples uniqueness can be very negative, and result in hurting people. IT does remind me, however, of the movie Good Will Hunting. In the movie he tells Robin William's character that being a Brick Layer is a noble career. The response he got was basically, yes, it is a noble career, but if you have an amazing gift that could be used for great things, it should be shared with the world.\n\nTruth is, I don't think many of us are outliers in the fact that we have amazingly unique skills, or ideas to bring to the world. Many of us are average, and there's nothing wrong with being average.\n\nBottom line though, if this can at least motivate everyone to try a little more, maybe hang those pictures up that have been sitting in the hallway for 6 months, then I think it's a benefit.", "id": "daqd28g"}, {"comment": "Everything you're saying is fine.\n\nBut the video clearly says that there is fault in being \"okay\" with a job, a house, and your weekends...when millions of people are striving to even achieve that. \n\nGood Will Hunting had a guy, in the 1990s American boom economy, who was a janitor while being a genius with math.

His only \"achievement\" - and it's a stretch to call it that - was to move beyond reading mountains of books and decide to move forward with something in his life because he was more or less stalled. \n\nThe average person isn't stalled - they're struggling to get by and achieve some semblance of a middle class life - and then this video comes along to \"motivate\" them to realize that even that struggle is not enough.

Trying to be better than yesterday is huge. \n\nTry to get a regular sleep schedule, be in bed by midnight and up by 9 or 10am(earlier even better). Just doing push ups and sit ups, as many as you can each morning or night, will get you moving and hopefully motivated to do more.

But obviously bud isn't a super great choice to do everyday. Depression could be the main issue thats causing the other issues.(like it was with me, addiction fucks the brain chemicals so I knew that was the main problem and could be yours).

So  Really think about it next time you smoke if you use it to relax and chill but don't get shit done or can be a functioning stoner. \n\nAnother, kind of weird possibility, is low testosterone. Not going to get deep into it, but opiates kill sex drive and T levels. Like, I went to the doctor cause I had a lump in my chest and ended up being some shit with my T levels.

It'll make you sleepy and satisfied. Buzzing with serotonin and a tired body. To do this, force yourself to show up to something one day. Get out of bed, consume a bunch of caffeine, shower, and show up. Even if you miss your early class, go to the later one. Go to a coffee shop. Go to the park. Just do something. It'll hurt for the first 10 minutes but the rest of the day will be really smooth. Once you're on a roll, use that adrenaline to get as much shit done as possible. Just pack it all in. Then when it's time to go to sleep, if you're not tired, consider popping a Benadryl. I know--omg, pharm, evil.

Obviously the best thing is to just go all in and be 100% healthy.   But even just not having the chips you're eating between meals is huge in making strides to have a healthier overall body.  Also going to the gym is a huge commitment.   The push up idea is great for someone looking to make small strides toward a healthier lifestyle.    It's quick,  it gets your body used to physical activity and raises your heartbeat.   That raise in heartbeat gives you temporary energy too which is cool.

It's also possible you have food allergies. A friend of mine has bad food allergies to like...almost everything. They don't exactly make him swell up and die, but rather make him have to go to the bathroom immediately. This might be your problem.\n\nYour depression is making your problems cyclical - i.e. you're already depressed which leads to behaviors, and those behaviors reinforce your depression which reinforces the behaviors. \n\n**Your Schedule**\n\nLet's try to focus on what you can control. First, we need to designate a basic, very general schedule. **If your work starts at 8am, you should ideally be waking up at 6am.** I say 6am because later start times can result in anxiety about making it on time, which can also lead to saying \"screw it, I won't make it, I'll just stay home\". Now that we have a single point of reference for your schedule, let's work from there.\n\nFrom 6am, we can give you a generalized bedtime between 9pm - 11pm. That will give you a window of 9 - 7 hours of sleep. 9pm seems crazy early, but we're just being conservative here to get started.\n\nFrom there, we can work on helping you fall asleep. \n\n**Falling Asleep**\n\nTurn off electronics by 9pm. Read a book or something else, just turn them off. If a strain of weed helps you sleep, then by all means smoke it as part of your falling-asleep-routine at 9pm. You don't have to quit smoking, you just have to re-route it for a different purpose, as I suspect you smoke it currently as a sort of escape from problems which isn't helping you.\n\n**The Rest of your Day up until 9pm**\n\nClass, Homework, working, hanging with the gf, whatever it is you do. I suggest not smoking weed during this period of time, save it for a time when you can not only enjoy it but put it to use where it actually benefits you. Ideally during this period of time you'll be fine, since your new routine will keep you from being tired / skipping / resulting in more depression and anxiety.\n\nRECAP on SCHEDULE:\n\n**Morning**\nGet up at 6am. Shower, dress, eat breakfast, head off to work.\n\n**After Work; Up until 9pm**\nClass, Homework, etc. A big chunk of time here.\n\n**Bedtime**\nStart between 9pm and 11pm. \nTurn off electronics by 9pm at the latest.\nSmoke if you think it will help you sleep. This might help re-enforce your routine if you look forward to it as well.\n\nYou might need to suffer for a day, maybe two, with less sleep since you'll have to break your current cycle. Once you get two days in of this, you'll be fine. \n\n", "id": "da7dzh5"}, {"comment": "Ok I'm making my schedule like you said , will my sleep be messed up if some days I get up at 6 and others 8? Should I just be up at 6 even if class is at 10?", "id": "da7gvuk"}, {"comment": "Nope, waking up at 6 or waking up at 8 won't make a big difference at all. The only important part is your bedtime, because with your bedtime you're ensuring that you get the needed amount of sleep no matter when you wake up. Waking up later will either mean you just get more sleep, or you might even find yourself waking up naturally between 6-8am. \n\nIf you have class at 10am, ideally you want to wake up at 8am. Whenever you have something to do in the mornings, wake up 2 hours prior to it if you can. Once you get into better habits you can shorten that time, but for now stick to 2 hours. It *really* relieves a lot of anxiety knowing you aren't rushing to get ready, have everything in order to go, have time to eat, etc. \n\n**I should add - waking up early gives you a chance to eat, drink coffee, and go to the bathroom (ahem, poo), which for me is an important part of the day so I don't worry about it later on in the morning :)**\n\n", "id": "da7hlfy"}, {"comment": "I'm following this", "id": "da7j05j"}, {"comment": "Please see a therapist. This is not a knock against you in any way. I was in your shoes at 19-20 years old, too. I failed my freshman year of college because I skipped too many classes, after being an A high school student. I'd never gotten an F before in my life. I couldn't make myself get out of bed for school, for work, even for friends, and all I wanted to do was smoke and drink.\n\nYou said it yourself that you know what you should do and also that it's easier said than done - amen, brother. This is why it is huge to have someone, preferably a professional, on your team as a coach and/or guide to help you get your life back on track. Dont settle for talk therapy. Keep trying different therapists until you find one that has a specific form of therapy (i.e. cognitive behavioral) with a timeline and specific goals. Be wary of any therapist who just wants you to keep coming back week after week without a plan. Keep searching - you will find a good one. In the meantime, set some goals for your education, which you say you are passionate about. What's next after this level of schooling? Associate's degree to bachelor's degree? Bachelor's to masters or job in government? Make a plan, and it will help at least a little bit, knowing that your classes now are part of that plan for your near future.\n\nA big piece of the vicious cycle is nutrition and fitness (ok 2 pieces). Yeah, in your situation it's going to SUCK to start an exercise or nutrition plan. I didn't get mine in place until after I started seeing a therapist and got my school back on track. It wasn't until I was 100 lbs overweight and my hot girlfriend broke up with me (not for being overweight, for being an asshole). Suddenly, I had a shit ton of motivation in the nutrition and exercise front.\n\nBut you don't have to make huge changes. Just small steps like taking a walk for 10 minutes every day. Or smoking/drinking 5 times a week instead of 7, or 3 instead of 5. And don't beat yourself up if you miss a day, just keep going. The thing about exercise is that it has been clinically proven to fight depression and boost feelings of wellbeing. And nutrition also plays an important role in your body's energy levels. Alcohol and fat slow the absorption of nutrients, and if not used for energy excess carbs will store as fat. If you're not very active, I'd recommend a paleo or similar diet. Once you start becoming more active, lower your fats and raise your carbs. Weed as far as I know doesn't affect long-term physical health but it did give me the munchies. Also your brain develops biologically until age 25, so cutting down on it could be beneficial.\n\nTLDR: see a therapist who will make a plan for you to get better, make a plan for your short term education/career goals, make small and manageable changes to excercise/nutrition and cut down a little on substance use, don't beat yourself up if you mess up", "id": "da7dxhv"}, {"comment": "I hope my school one is good like this but if not , I'll find one", "id": "da7gy81"}, {"comment": "You need the professional counseling you were talking about.

But I'm male, lower 20s, have an associates degree, and work full time. But I was depressed asf, literally laid in bed all day, barely ate or did any sort of exercise. It was kind of easy for me to kick my own ass into shape cause I put myself in the situation(fuck heroin). But bouncing off other comments, just little differences will eventually make a huge difference. Trying to be better than yesterday is huge. \n\nTry to get a regular sleep schedule, be in bed by midnight and up by 9 or 10am(earlier even better). Just doing push ups and sit ups, as many as you can each morning or night, will get you moving and hopefully motivated to do more. Eating healthy foods that give you energy(I'd seriously research foods to eat, many help with sleep/energy/muscle growth, etc). Take some walks with your gf. Pretty much anything that gets you moving and releases chemicals in your brain to feel better. \n\nThe bud depends on the person. Weed helped me a shit ton recover(from fucking heroin addiction). But even before I was using hard shit, I'd smoke to get shit done and lighten my mood. Before sports, classes, work, really anything. Only when I was reallll baked would I turn couch potato. But obviously bud isn't a super great choice to do everyday. Depression could be the main issue thats causing the other issues.(like it was with me, addiction fucks the brain chemicals so I knew that was the main problem and could be yours). But bud made me take my mind off bad shit and make me wanna be outside walking or doing some shit but laying in bed. So  Really think about it next time you smoke if you use it to relax and chill but don't get shit done or can be a functioning stoner. \n\nAnother, kind of weird possibility, is low testosterone. Not going to get deep into it, but opiates kill sex drive and T levels. Like, I went to the doctor cause I had a lump in my chest and ended up being some shit with my T levels. It was the lowest this specialist has seen, like I had 16 and normal was 150-200 hahaha. It was really fucked. (Back to normal now, thank fucking god). But that fucked even more wirh my brain chemicals making my depression worse. There's too many reason how depression develops but most of them root back to the chemicals being out of whack. So finding ways to fire off more should help a shit ton. Which the few things I listed will help snd I'm sure other comments have good ideas. \n\nTldr: pretty much what you explained sounds like you're somewhat depressed. I never thought I was depressed and didn't even know how it felt, but all research about recovery points out hella depression when the drugs are taken away. So research, research, research about it including how to release more chemicals(naturally!) And what/how eating right will help. It's prolly too late to drop your class, but you seriously just have to set a daily mission to get your shit done so you don't get kicked out of college.

It'll make you sleepy and satisfied. Buzzing with serotonin and a tired body. To do this, force yourself to show up to something one day. Get out of bed, consume a bunch of caffeine, shower, and show up. Even if you miss your early class, go to the later one. Go to a coffee shop. Go to the park. Just do something. It'll hurt for the first 10 minutes but the rest of the day will be really smooth. Once you're on a roll, use that adrenaline to get as much shit done as possible. Just pack it all in.

Though my life began to improve I found myself more than ever in a downward spiral of depression and it was easier for me to identify given the overall life improvement. \n\nAfter seeing a psychiatrist about the problem they gave me a prescription for depression and my life has drastically changed for the better! I can recognize the positivity in my life with full embrace, my motivation to succeed is at an all time high, and I have little if any want for the irresponsible choices I used to make. I know theres stigma behind depression and medication to treat it but please know that you should talk to a professional about this and listen to their guidance. For me it wasn't a matter or not trying or the external forces affecting my mood but the chemical imbalance in my brain which was keeping me from experiencing life to its fullest potential and I'm glad I took the step to improve my life by seeking help and listening to what they had to say. I really hope this helps you!\n\n", "id": "da7emt5"}, {"comment": "Did the med change you as a person at all, I'm so scared of that", "id": "da7gr4y"}], [{"comment": "No one here can diagnose you with depression.

Sometimes you have bad days, sometimes you have good ones, but the best you can do now is put yourself in situations where it's difficult to get distracted.

It's good that you're thinking about this, though, because that means you care about changing. And if you keep plugging away, you'll get there eventually.\n\nNobody ever really told me this when I was younger, but school truly isn't for everyone. Especially today -- the school landscape is totally different than when I graduated 15 years ago... class sizes are bigger, there's more emphasis on testing and having people learn a certain way, when people aren't one-size-fits-all. Definitely finish high school, even if your grades are meh, and try to figure out what you want to do with your life. Then comes the hard part... working towards it. You just haven't found what M.O. works for you yet, which is totally understandable at this point in your life. "], [2, "It sounds like depression possibly mixed in with some ADD and a somewhat lack of discipline. I've been there before, I think I'm there right now even (just graduated, can't be fucked to find a job). I don't know what your daily routine is like but I would suggest slowly implementing some positive habits that will work over time to eventually pull you out of depression which should automatically get rid of the ADD (or lessen it at least). \n\nFirst thing you wanna do is attack the base. Clean up your diet (eliminate junk food, processed foods, refined sugar, simple carbs, excess salt, etc and eat a variety of veg and fruit, a lot of fish, nuts and seeds, a gallon of water and other clean foods) and make sure your exercising regularly. Sport is the best option because it is actually a fun and social activity so it is easier to stick to than a workout routine. Martial arts is amazing for instilling discipline and a sense of purpose as well as boosting your self-confidence (If you're interested I would suggest something like boxing, muay thai, wrestling, BJJ over eastern arts like karate, taekwondo, aikido - it's a more intense workout and way more effective). This will allow your brain to function closer to its optimum level so when you do study you're learning more efficiently.\n\nAfter this you need to work on instilling a more positive mindset. I get the feeling you overthink yourself into depression through feelings of guilt and uselessness. Honestly, there's nothing to be guilty about. You're in a delicate phase of your life and this is completely normal. A lot more kids are going through this than you realise. When you get to your 20s you're gonna sit around with your friends and say \"man I wish I could be 13/14 again, all I would do is fuck around and cause trouble because at that age it literally just does not matter.\" Your important years are ahead of you, not behind you. Don't rely on God to make things better, there's no guarantee he will answer. Some of the most religious people have the worst lives. You need to take things into your own hands. Start the day with 10 minutes of exercise (run a mile, do a circuit, whatever) and then follow it up with some yoga and guided meditation where all you focus on is instilling positive thoughts and releasing all the negative ones. It takes time but if you drill positive affirmations into your head consistently enough it will seep into your subconscious and you will begin to believe it and act on it. YOU ARE WHAT YOU THINK. If you can learn to control your thoughts you will have a serious advantage in life. Look into NLP and self-hypnosis as well you might find that useful.\n\nMake small changes in your life that instil discpline. Things like doing your bed every morning, keeping your room tidy, creating folders for school and organising them and making it easier for you to learn. Also going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day. Create to do lists every morning. Limit video games to a certain duration. Try to take a genuine interest in your subjects. The world is fascinating, make gaining knowledge a priority in your life because it will help you oh so much. It will literally help you in everything, socialising, opening career opportunities, getting pussy, starting a business, etc.\n\nI feel like I've written a lot so I'll end it there, don't try to do all these things at once. You will get overwhelmed and quit. Try to implement one new habit every 2 weeks. Take the long-term approach. You're not gonna completely change your life in a day, or week or even a month. Good luck.\n\nEdit: Stay away from anti-depressants and medication. They don't address the root of the problem and can often worsen things. No need to drug yourself at such a young age. Also, parents care about more than just which letter grade you got on your test. When they see you make big change in your life and they see the surge in energy and wellbeing that you will inevitably display, they will be very happy and lot more forgiving of poor test results you got in the past.  \n"], [1, "lol I got the same exact thing but there is a thing called aeries that allows your parents to check your grades. So they're always on me. That's the good thing because they can just talk to me and I can vent. The thing with me is that whatever happens good or bad I can can just sleep it off. A bad day= no problem its in the past and only the future matters. gg. I have been in situations similar to yours but in the end its all good. So right now you should just tell your parents everything. They will understand gg.

Both of these things can eat away at your self esteem and make it even harder to bounce back the next time without a system of support.  It helps to let others know what you're going through, not so they can feel sorry for you, but so that they have the chance to understand and be there for you when you do feel down and unmotivated.  High school was the hardest thing for me to go through. The work was hard and there were some classes that I felt didn't really apply to me because I didn't find them interesting. That makes it tough right there to be interested and motivated to study and succeed. Family can help you study by quizzing you. That said, you might want to use gaming or whatever as a reward for studying.  Also, I don't recommend studying for long periods of time. Study for an hour. Take a 15-30 minute break. Then study again. Most importantly, try not to beat yourself up all the time.  You know what you're doing (not studying, saying fuck it, and feeling unmotivated) which is half the battle.  The other half is allowing others to shore you up and cheer you on to the finish line.  Just remember, no matter how old you are, you will always need others on the same page as you so that they can help you through the rough patches.

I would get home from school(highschool) and look at what I have to do for that night/week, and the list would be huge but then I would just say fuck it and play videogames all night. Then after awhile I would tell my parents that I was done with hw and then I go to bed, whilst actually staying up and playing more video games.\n\nYour problem is that you are unmotivated and depressed, the later of which derives from a combination of your two years of lacking social interaction and boredom. \n\nYou had a great run where you had friends and did well, but then it plummeted. From there you had a low spot but now you're doing ok right now. The problem is that it never feels as good as when you had so many friends and were doing so well. You long for those moments again but you know you can't have them which makes you depressed. From there you seek to escape that depression through the outlet of videogames. However, as I can tell you, that will quickly lead to drinking and drugs which brings you nowhere but down.\n\nThe unmotivation comes from the repetition. You get home every day, and to escape what you don't like about your life you fill your mind with someone else's life, i.e. the hero(s) of your videogames. It has become habit and from there you no longer desire to improve now matter how much you tell yourself to do. \n\nYou need to break the cycle of depression, which is never easy. Heres how I got out:\n\nI eventually talked to my parents about it, after getting caught, and they offered small things they could do to help, an offer I took. But the big things are finding someone to talk to and realizing that it's your fault. You need someone who you can talk to, who is there for you on a regular basis, this could be a friend, girlfriend, teacher, sibling, it doesn't matter, but you need them. \n\nAnd the second thing is you need to realize that you are here because of your own actions, and by none of someone else's. So many times I've found myself saying that maybe if someone had done this better than I wouldn't be like this. No, you are where you are because you brought yourself there. You have exactly the life you want to have. What's more though, is that you WILL have exactly the life you want. So if you keep doing this, you will make a bad future for yourself.

There are plenty of adults who don't make connections like you have.\n\nThere isn't anything that you've done that cannot be undone.\n\nAsk yourself what you want in this life.  Dig deep and really ask yourself who you are and where you want to go.  Use that as your motivation to do your school work.  No one is going to give you a high school diploma.  You have to earn it.  Only you can do the work and the good news is you are capable. \n\nWhether it is school, or chores or work, No one likes doing those tasks.  Accomplish the work in bite size chunks with a realistic plan.  My advice is not to put it off to 'tomorrow' or 'tonight after one tv show.'  Do it now, even for a few minutes.  You'll feel better.\n\nTry your best to get the grades you want - but know that no one asks to see your marks outside of college and universities, certainly not most employers.  Heck I've seen college programs accept students without a review on grades but merely proof of high school grad.  Diplomas are printed without grades and no one asks or cares in the world outside education.  \n\nAs for videogames:  Ask yourself why you play them.  I suspect it is for a sense of mastery and relaxation.  Those are normal feelings to want.  Don't be hard on yourself for wanting to play video games.  Allow yourself to play, trust yourself to moderate it and balance getting your work done.\n\nTell yourself you can do this, celebrate your successes no matter how small.\n\n\n  "], [1, "I went through this exact thing except later in my school career.

Especially today -- the school landscape is totally different than when I graduated 15 years ago... class sizes are bigger, there's more emphasis on testing and having people learn a certain way, when people aren't one-size-fits-all. Definitely finish high school, even if your grades are meh, and try to figure out what you want to do with your life. Then comes the hard part... working towards it. You just haven't found what M.O. works for you yet, which is totally understandable at this point in your life. ", "id": "dain31h"}], [{"comment": "It sounds like depression possibly mixed in with some ADD and a somewhat lack of discipline. I've been there before, I think I'm there right now even (just graduated, can't be fucked to find a job). I don't know what your daily routine is like but I would suggest slowly implementing some positive habits that will work over time to eventually pull you out of depression which should automatically get rid of the ADD (or lessen it at least). \n\nFirst thing you wanna do is attack the base. Clean up your diet (eliminate junk food, processed foods, refined sugar, simple carbs, excess salt, etc and eat a variety of veg and fruit, a lot of fish, nuts and seeds, a gallon of water and other clean foods) and make sure your exercising regularly. Sport is the best option because it is actually a fun and social activity so it is easier to stick to than a workout routine. Martial arts is amazing for instilling discipline and a sense of purpose as well as boosting your self-confidence (If you're interested I would suggest something like boxing, muay thai, wrestling, BJJ over eastern arts like karate, taekwondo, aikido - it's a more intense workout and way more effective). This will allow your brain to function closer to its optimum level so when you do study you're learning more efficiently.\n\nAfter this you need to work on instilling a more positive mindset. I get the feeling you overthink yourself into depression through feelings of guilt and uselessness. Honestly, there's nothing to be guilty about. You're in a delicate phase of your life and this is completely normal. A lot more kids are going through this than you realise. When you get to your 20s you're gonna sit around with your friends and say \"man I wish I could be 13/14 again, all I would do is fuck around and cause trouble because at that age it literally just does not matter.\" Your important years are ahead of you, not behind you. Don't rely on God to make things better, there's no guarantee he will answer. Some of the most religious people have the worst lives. You need to take things into your own hands. Start the day with 10 minutes of exercise (run a mile, do a circuit, whatever) and then follow it up with some yoga and guided meditation where all you focus on is instilling positive thoughts and releasing all the negative ones. It takes time but if you drill positive affirmations into your head consistently enough it will seep into your subconscious and you will begin to believe it and act on it. YOU ARE WHAT YOU THINK. If you can learn to control your thoughts you will have a serious advantage in life. Look into NLP and self-hypnosis as well you might find that useful.\n\nMake small changes in your life that instil discpline. Things like doing your bed every morning, keeping your room tidy, creating folders for school and organising them and making it easier for you to learn. Also going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day. Create to do lists every morning. Limit video games to a certain duration. Try to take a genuine interest in your subjects. The world is fascinating, make gaining knowledge a priority in your life because it will help you oh so much. It will literally help you in everything, socialising, opening career opportunities, getting pussy, starting a business, etc.\n\nI feel like I've written a lot so I'll end it there, don't try to do all these things at once. You will get overwhelmed and quit. Try to implement one new habit every 2 weeks. Take the long-term approach. You're not gonna completely change your life in a day, or week or even a month. Good luck.\n\nEdit: Stay away from anti-depressants and medication. They don't address the root of the problem and can often worsen things. No need to drug yourself at such a young age. Also, parents care about more than just which letter grade you got on your test. When they see you make big change in your life and they see the surge in energy and wellbeing that you will inevitably display, they will be very happy and lot more forgiving of poor test results you got in the past.  \n", "id": "daj13mk"}, {"comment": "I'm not OP, but thank you for writing this.

I would get home from school(highschool) and look at what I have to do for that night/week, and the list would be huge but then I would just say fuck it and play videogames all night. Then after awhile I would tell my parents that I was done with hw and then I go to bed, whilst actually staying up and playing more video games.\n\nYour problem is that you are unmotivated and depressed, the later of which derives from a combination of your two years of lacking social interaction and boredom. \n\nYou had a great run where you had friends and did well, but then it plummeted. From there you had a low spot but now you're doing ok right now. The problem is that it never feels as good as when you had so many friends and were doing so well. You long for those moments again but you know you can't have them which makes you depressed. From there you seek to escape that depression through the outlet of videogames. However, as I can tell you, that will quickly lead to drinking and drugs which brings you nowhere but down.\n\nThe unmotivation comes from the repetition. You get home every day, and to escape what you don't like about your life you fill your mind with someone else's life, i.e. the hero(s) of your videogames. It has become habit and from there you no longer desire to improve now matter how much you tell yourself to do. \n\nYou need to break the cycle of depression, which is never easy. Heres how I got out:\n\nI eventually talked to my parents about it, after getting caught, and they offered small things they could do to help, an offer I took. But the big things are finding someone to talk to and realizing that it's your fault. You need someone who you can talk to, who is there for you on a regular basis, this could be a friend, girlfriend, teacher, sibling, it doesn't matter, but you need them. \n\nAnd the second thing is you need to realize that you are here because of your own actions, and by none of someone else's. So many times I've found myself saying that maybe if someone had done this better than I wouldn't be like this. No, you are where you are because you brought yourself there. You have exactly the life you want to have. What's more though, is that you WILL have exactly the life you want. So if you keep doing this, you will make a bad future for yourself. And I'm sure you have plans for life, so get off your ass and realize them.", "id": "dajnq31"}], [{"comment": "First of all take a deep breath.  \nAcknowledge that someone who recognizes their current and past behaviour is not achieving the results important to them is an intelligent thought from a smart person.  There are plenty of adults who don't make connections like you have.\n\nThere isn't anything that you've done that cannot be undone.\n\nAsk yourself what you want in this life.  Dig deep and really ask yourself who you are and where you want to go.  Use that as your motivation to do your school work.  No one is going to give you a high school diploma.  You have to earn it.  Only you can do the work and the good news is you are capable. \n\nWhether it is school, or chores or work, No one likes doing those tasks.  Accomplish the work in bite size chunks with a realistic plan.  My advice is not to put it off to 'tomorrow' or 'tonight after one tv show.'  Do it now, even for a few minutes.  You'll feel better.\n\nTry your best to get the grades you want - but know that no one asks to see your marks outside of college and universities, certainly not most employers.  Heck I've seen college programs accept students without a review on grades but merely proof of high school grad.  Diplomas are printed without grades and no one asks or cares in the world outside education.  \n\nAs for videogames:  Ask yourself why you play them.  I suspect it is for a sense of mastery and relaxation.  Those are normal feelings to want.  Don't be hard on yourself for wanting to play video games.  Allow yourself to play, trust yourself to moderate it and balance getting your work done.\n\nTell yourself you can do this, celebrate your successes no matter how small.\n\n\n  ", "id": "dak3kg9"}], [{"comment": "I went through this exact thing except later in my school career. I prayed I really did. I prayed hard that God would change my thoughts, you know give me motivation. It never really came. Strange thing is I still got through, every year.

I wish I could tell you a way to get motivation and whatnot but... I don't even have it. Legitimately the only thing that got me through school was praying to God. Finding good quality friends (normally the really strange ones) helps sadness. Whether you believe in my God or some other one is up to you and I'm not trying to push it on you.

And you never know, that \"shitty part time job\" could lead into a full time job or a reference to something you really want.\nFinally, what I've learned is that it is all about confidence in yourself. I moved to a new state for my finance's job. I went to a temp office and they sent me onto a construction site with zero experience and I also have a degree deemed \"worthless\".

Every single night. This was the habit that was the most bang-for-my-buck for me. It takes about 3 days, and then your body learns how to rest like you've never rested before.\n* Information/social media/internet/video game cleanse. Try this for one day. You will be bored as fuck, and the discomfort you feel is your brain actually working. See how easy it is to workout when you can't distract yourself.\n* Maybe your job IS shit. Is it possible to change your attitude? Maybe you can deliberately look for things to be thankful for. \"Boss said thank you today\" or \"Customer was nice to me today.\"\n* Try being a \"craftsman\" at work. Find one small thing every day to improve about your performance and force your mind to take pride in these things (hint: write it in your journal). If you truly have a bad job, then you need to do this one just for yourself. It will be tough, but this habit will pay dividends for the rest of your life.

You're going to be 23 or 24 or however old you are, only once in your whole life. This time will never come back. This life is a gift. You being on this planet was a chance event - a one in a billion chance. You must get the most out of this life! I think Socrates writings really inspired me. 'Let him that would move the world first move himself.' / 'The unexamined life is not worth living.' / 'To find yourself, think for yourself.'\n\nMy problem was, I would feel incredibly inspired by these things for about five minutes, and then start procrastinating again. Also, because of my sedentary lifestyle, I had become totally out of shape, and that would add to my depression. I am 26, and I felt like I could never get back into shape or get any self-discipline into my life. Whenever you think this way, remember that YOU have to push yourself, no one else is going to do it for you. \n\nWhat I did was, I downloaded an app called Simple Routine and set a bunch of inspiring quotes as daily reminders. Here are two of them that pop up on my lock screen around 5.30 each morning, when I wake up for the gym: \n\n'No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.' (Socrates)\n\n'For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' (Steve Jobs)\n\nI try to think about that a lot. If it were my last day here, what would I do? What would I do differently? What experiences would I want? Once you get into the habit of thinking like that, and make an exercise routine, you will start to feel better. You will become more disciplined, your productivity will go up, you'll start to look better, and your confidence will go up too. \n\nWhen we haven't done it, we try to build it up in our head as something really difficult or out of our ability. But it's really simple. Take it one step at a time. Don't treat it like some big experiment. Just start with small changes, and you'll get there. There's no need to stress. You have your whole life ahead of you and a lot of exciting experiences awaiting. All successful people have at some point fallen into the kind of abyss where you are right now. You sort of need that too I think, to start appreciating the good things about life. They all picked themselves up and managed to do great things with their lives, and so will you. \n\nAll the best!\n\nEDIT: Please excuse yourself from social media, except maybe Reddit which wouldn't make you feel awful about yourself. I did that and without it I don't think I would be able go fall into this routine. Trust me, going through posts of amazing things your friends are doing is something you really don't need in your life, and you're getting nothing out if it.   "], [3, "I know exactly how you feel.

I need to hand in a thesis proposal at the end of this month. I've barely thought about it.

I would say it's been a year now but I found some traction. Jordan Peterson is a professor in psychology, but he's a lot more than that. I highly recommend watching his lectures on maps and meaning, he was able to explain the state that I currently inhabit; which I found very enlightening. \nI've come to accept this period as one of self reflection and I guess questioned myself, my qualities, my values, my ambitions and generally what makes me me.\n\n I now know that this state comes about in stressful periods. I revert back to a very childish mind set and that was gaming. I didn't play for about 6 years. That changed and took hold. I guess what I'm trying to point out is that understanding your own behaviour helps you visualise your current state of being. For example: why do I play? Because it's fun and challenging. Why? Because it's competitive and I want to be the best. Why? I guess it's because being the best confirms your own ability. Etc.\nBut then the question: so why not apply that to your passion?\n\nThis is the big question, and the answer is that I should. Others may have fears like, it's hard work, too much time, what if I don't get a job etc. For me it's commitment and failure, my worst possible scenario is be a captain on a sinking ship. Yes there are a lot of metaphors in there but I'll leave at that. Well I hope this makes sense. \n\nMy brother had a good analogy. He suggested that we're all on the side of a cliff. There are those that jump, and fly. And there are those that stay. I never once perceived the world from the prospective and I guess it's spot on. Your fears are the things stopping you (and me) from taking the leap. Committing to the jump. Working hard to get there. Failure is an option, but not the final outcome.\n\nThis may get buried in the 230 + comments but here's my piece. Oh and Peterson has his book, in pdf form, for free.

That 30 days was the difference between me feeling completely lost and drifting to me feeling like I had a plan and was carrying it out. Once that was finished I worked for an outdoor school for a bit before I started college. I just finished my bachelors, only I'm in my middle 30's now. I just realized in writing this that I am feeling like I'm drifting because I haven't given myself a rite of passage for that big change. Looks like it's time to go climb a mountain!\n\nSeriously tho, my rite's of passage are potentially going to be different for me than for you, or you doing what you can be comfortable with. The key is to do SOMETHING MEANINGFUL that gives you a sense of closure on the last 4-5 years of your life. It should honor the extreme effort and commitment that got you through your college years. And really ideally, it should have some relation, in some way either big or small, to your degree. It's just a way to validate your hard work to yourself, your subconscious, or whatever.\n\nFor example My NOLS trip was related to my military service because the group teamwork reminded me of what I loved about the military.

I've finished university this June, and the last semester was the most motivated and the happiest time in my life so far. I changed my lifestyle, started to work out daily and saw results, I was going to university lectures, languages classes and swing dance classes, and  also preparing for my exams, while doing a part-time job.

It kept me motivated and gave me so much energy there were days I just jumped out of bed and started doing what I have to do right away.\n\nAfter graduation, I succeeded in finding a job abroad as well, so in September I started working 40 hours a week. I was living in a dormitory before, so it's the first time I'm renting a flat and had my own room as well. It felt very good to have my first real job, but aside from that, my well balanced life with all the set, positive habits ceased to exist. It was shocking to experience how little time I had after work with all the household chores and cooking, and even in that little time I was browsing reddit on my phone mostly. I was floating somewhere between the tons of new paths I could have chosen from, with no directions, nothing to do, but I was so tired I couldn't bring myself to do anything.  I felt stuck in the same vicious circle every day, no matter what I planned, I just couldn't carry it out. I've experienced terrible mood swings.

I noticed that how imbalanced I was because of the constant noise in my head, and I was in denial when I started to put my attention to browsing the Internet and not to think about how to overcome this. So one day I forced myself to write everything down. Ideas, plans, fears, doubts, everything, then I examined them one by one and made some order. I decided to make it a habit: whenever something comes to my mind (something to buy or a promise to a friend I shouldn't forget about), I save it in Google Keep to the right list.\n\n2) I started to track my mood changes with a great app called Daylio. It helps to appreciate the little things more, also to start to see what's the connection between a bad day and your actions, which is motivating. It also draws a graph about your monthly mood swings, now it's more or less a constant up and down with hitting the bottom for me so far, but hey, at least I see I'm trying. I think it's the most important thing you should keep in mind: just know you're working on it and have at least part of control. \n\n3) Little by little, I returned to the habits that made me happy. I've found a good gym, started to attend to language classes again, made some time for meditation every day. I constantly remind myself of the person I was before this big shift happened, and tell myself I can do it again, but this is a next level and therefore, it needs a new approach.\nI started to listen to motivational podcasts at work, and try hard to make some time to do something meaningful day, every day, even if it's a little thing. New, productive habits grow from these seeds.\n\nStart small and be patient, the purpose is enough in the beginning, so you're on the right path, OP.

You'll travel,  work hard,  and meet some pretty amazing people.  "], [2, "This sounds like something that is becoming more common these days (or perhaps it always was?) since I have also felt that way.  College was awesome because you could pursue your interests and to everyone else that was acceptable.  After college you are expected to find a career and work your ass off for the majority of your life, and most people don't get to pursue their interests like they could before.\n\nWork consumes your life.  There just isn't usually time for anything fun.  I found this incredibly unsatisfying, even when I finally got a job in the field I was hoping to break into.  It just wasn't good enough.  I was still doing menial things for hours on end sitting in front of a computer screen, only this time it was stuff I *had* to do, not stuff I *wanted* to do.\n\nThis all happened *after* I turned 30, after going back to school a *second* time to get a *second* bachelors degree in something different from what I learned the first time.  Now I'm switching gears *yet* ***again*** to go into a completely unrelated field where I'll be working with my hands instead of a computer, and I'm hoping to have the time in this career to fit those other interests into my schedule in a non-work related way.\n\nI don't know if this new path will work out or not, but now I'm in my early 30's, my friends are married and having kids and buying homes and cars, and I haven't even been able to save enough money to buy a new computer to replace my 6-year-old machine quite yet, let alone move out of my parents basement.  It's *incredibly* depressing, and that depression and anxiety about the future threatened to cripple me.\n\nI've wasted so many hours in this process just trying to escape from the depression of the realization that the real world sucks and doesn't care about me, that it has taken me until my 30's to get to a place where I think I can actually make it now.  Video games and TV and smoking weed were all wrapped into that process of escape.  After a while I think that even the games and shows started to lose their appeal though because I knew in the back of my mind that it was unsustainable.  Eventually I'd run out of money for food and weed and buying new games and such, and I had to figure things out... but it was just ***so*** hard to figure out what I wanted to do, since I knew that it was going to be a huge decision that would affect my life for years to come.  What if I made the wrong choice and regretted it?  Well making no choice at all was *also* the wrong choice as it turns out.\n\nI think having a plan now is helping a bit... I still suffer depression now and then, but for the first time in my life I'm thinking more than a couple of years down the road.  I have a girlfriend of 3 years who has been pretty supportive and we are hoping to move in together as soon as we can afford moving out of our parents' places.  Previously whenever I imagined the future, I didn't have any specific plan in place... I just figured I'd pursue a certain goal and hope that everything fell into place.  But then I would just end up procrastinating instead of pursuing that goal.  My current plan isn't exactly fully fleshed out and detailed or anything... but it at least considers the long term, and I can work out the finer details later.  I know the next few steps and I have accepted that whatever this career is like, I don't have to stick with it forever if I don't want to, it is okay to move again into something new.  That said, I will likely stick with this for a while at least, long enough to earn a decent living with it, and then maybe in another decade or so I will have enough financial stability in my life to switch things up again to pursue my ultimate goal.\n\nThis turned into quite a long story, but just wanted to add my experience to this post and show that it's okay to not know what to do with yourself sometimes.  I think we all experience that for a bit in our 20's and even into our 30's.  It's okay if you are behind where your friends are at.  It's okay if you have your midlife crisis at the age of 27... and then again at 33.  Nobody is going to decide your life for you, eventually you'll come to a breaking point where you are just going to have to go with something and hope for the best.  *That's* where real life outside of school actually begins.

I've been in a downward spiral of denial, avoidance, and self-hate for at least the past 10 months and have all the while getting worse, more and more apathetic. I graduated in May too and have been feeling the same way you have. Actually, I lied, I failed a class my last semester and had to take a summer school course to make up the credit. Unlike you I have no job and have spent most of my time in bed or on the couch. I spent May, June, July on my couch watching tv. Clearing out series at a time, Homeland, MadMen, Lost, even Basketball Wives L.A., for variety, and of course watching every soccer game available. \n\nAfter I left school I found I couldn't finish the simplest of tasks. I had struggled with procrastination in school, but every thing shut down once I got home and didn't have the structure of sports or class. I should have seen it coming to be honest. My attention span had been failing me in extreme ways in the spring. I had a nasty and strange relationship with porn. I would watch it throughout the day, interspersed with other activities. Most people will whip out their phones in moments where they have free time, when they're unoccupied, in order to browse the internet, maybe reddit to kill some time. I watched porn. Not really even watched, just browsed. Find interesting links, skim, close the video and repeat. It was a lot more stimulating than your garden variety facebook feed. I just could not go unstimulated.\n\nThe big task I failed at in the summer though was writing thank you notes to all the people who came to my graduation or had sent me gifts. Every day I planned on doing it but I just couldn't bring myself to sit down and actually write \"thank you\" to the people who love me most. And forget applying to jobs. Not a chance. My head was just too cluttered; I couldn't think straight.\n\nI've gained 40 pounds since the New Year. I've had to size up in all of my clothes.\n\nIn August I started playing video games, specifically Football Manager. I was obsessed with creating this little soccering fantasy world where everything was perfect, my team, my players, where I was successful, winning trophies doing everything I couldn't in real life. I logged a little under 600 hours in 9 weeks. I'd spent ~38% of my time playing Football manager. 9 hours a day. More than a full time job. If I was awake and home I was playing Football Manager, period. \n\nAbout a week ago, my addictions and delusions and avoidances and compulsions had reached a peak. My father and I had just come back from dropping my mother off at the airport and I wanted to take a nap. I knew that I should just go upstairs and go to sleep. But I just needed to get on reddit for a bit. Just one link. I surfed reddit for 3 hours then jerked off and by then it was too late to take a nap. I sat in my bed realized that I couldn't even nap without procrastinating. And I snapped. I realized that I was just fucking kidding myself. That I needed help or I needed to help myself. I realized that I was unwell, that something needed to change. \n\nAnd it all stopped. I put my computer away. I started reflecting on what I wanted to do for a living and started making steps in that direction. It's been a week and I haven't played any football manager and didn't even have any cravings until today. I work about 6 hours a day trying to teach myself code/webdev and so far it's gone alright. I'm making a pretty shitty webpage as we speak.\n \nLike you I knew something was wrong. I knew I had to change. Before last Saturday, I managed to stop playing games and stay off of reddit for a for days at a time, keep my laptop under my bed. Of course I would just watch tv, which was a lesser drug. Heroin for Methadone. But it was a step in the right direction. Ultimately, I just couldn't imagine not living how I was living. I couldn't imagine what a day would be like without video games or reddit or porn. Actually I could, *unbearably painful*. I mean, maybe not unbearable pain, but pain worse than the pain I was experiencing by going through my daily routine (and trust me when I say I know and have experienced your pain. The pain from denying pain and avoiding it and the pain of engaging in the painful compulsions that keep that greater pain away and the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts-trapped-in-all-of-this-pain, unable to even imagine an alternative to your suffering pain). I knew that there were alternatives. I knew that normally functioning adults did it all the time. I knew that I myself could do it. But, and if you read and know one thing I write, it's this: **I wasn't ready.** I just wasn't ready. I didn't know that I didn't know. In March, when I was in the third floor of the science building, watching porn before class, I wasn't ready. When I was surfing reddit and watching Homeland (a really ridiculous show which I didn't even like) until 3 in the morning every day, I wasn't ready. When I was creating my football club for 15th time so I could it could be absolutely perfect, since the shade of blue I chose for the jerseys was too light, I wasn't ready. And that's all okay.\n\nI'm not saying I'm cured, or that I've got everything figured out. I could slip back into the same mess I was in tomorrow. But right now I'm alright and I think, no I believe, that I'm going to be alright.\n\nHopefully, one day you'll be ready, sooner rather than later.

I mean, I'm never going to be a professional guitarist or a successful author so technically those activities are as much of a waste as tv/gaming.

It's OK to feel lost right after college, but don't wallow in that.  It's important that you find a way to give yourself a rite of passage to commemorate and announce this big life change to yourself, and your subconscious.  When I left the military I chose to spend 30 days in the Montana high-country with a group called National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS).  That 30 days was the difference between me feeling completely lost and drifting to me feeling like I had a plan and was carrying it out.  Once that was finished I worked for an outdoor school for a bit before I started college.  I just finished my bachelors, only I'm in my middle 30's now.  I just realized in writing this that I am feeling like I'm drifting because I haven't given myself a rite of passage for that big change.  Looks like it's time to go climb a mountain!\n\nSeriously tho, my rite's of passage are potentially going to be different for me than for you, or you doing what you can be comfortable with.  The key is to do SOMETHING MEANINGFUL that gives you a sense of closure on the last 4-5 years of your life.  It should honor the extreme effort and commitment that got you through your college years.  And really ideally, it should have some relation, in some way either big or small, to your degree.  It's just a way to validate your hard work to yourself, your subconscious, or whatever.  \n\nFor example My NOLS trip was related to my military service because the group teamwork reminded me of what I loved about the military.  It also helped me deal with the fact that my actions took peoples lives because I was taking a Wilderness First Responder Course.

We're in a private beta, and I'd be more than happy to send you an invite if that sounds up your alley.\n\n* **Todoist** - Another I'd recommend is Todoist. Their tracker doesn't have any gaming components, but it has a simple UI that has very little clutter. Adding tasks, notes and habits feels really solid with Todoist. They also track some simple performance measures on your tasks, which can be fun/motivating to view.\n\nTo make sure you get the most out of task tracking you gotta be kind to yourself, and understand you'll definitely fall off the bandwagon every once and awhile. Developing the willpower and discipline to stick with it is tough, but absolutely doable.

It's harder to be focused on ourselves when we're focusing on others.\n\nI'm by no means over the motivation hump at the moment, but after awhile I feel like I'm starting to figure out what's important and what needs done.

My definition of persistent is that you need to become relentless in creating goals and finding strategies that work (and figuring out what ISN'T working).\n\nIt isn't enough to just sit there and hope you get hit with divine inspiration. And it isn't enough to think that you can \"just do it\" or \"grit your teeth extra hard\" and change your life.\n\nLet's say your strategy right now for making sure you workout is (I have tricked myself into thinking this works before):\n\n* Come home from work\n* Eat\n* Can't workout when you're full. Watch netflix or videogames while you digest\n* Find motivation to workout\n\nHow's it working (this obviously never fucking works)? Or what's your success rate?

Google \"5 minute journal\" or \"bullet journal\" for ideas about what to write about\n* 10 minutes of morning meditation - try the HeadSpace app. I actually preferred learning from the book \"Search Inside Yourself.\"\n* Go to sleep before 10. Every single night. This was the habit that was the most bang-for-my-buck for me. It takes about 3 days, and then your body learns how to rest like you've never rested before.\n* Information/social media/internet/video game cleanse. Try this for one day. You will be bored as fuck, and the discomfort you feel is your brain actually working. See how easy it is to workout when you can't distract yourself.\n* Maybe your job IS shit. Is it possible to change your attitude? Maybe you can deliberately look for things to be thankful for. \"Boss said thank you today\" or \"Customer was nice to me today.\"\n* Try being a \"craftsman\" at work. Find one small thing every day to improve about your performance and force your mind to take pride in these things (hint: write it in your journal). If you truly have a bad job, then you need to do this one just for yourself. It will be tough, but this habit will pay dividends for the rest of your life.

I basically never did anything on time, and I started to hate myself. I felt like I had not only failed everyone else's expectations from me, but I had failed myself. I felt like there was no going back. \n\nBut here's what I did, and what might work for you. Think about this, you have ONE life. You're going to be 23 or 24 or however old you are, only once in your whole life. This time will never come back. This life is a gift. You being on this planet was a chance event - a one in a billion chance. You must get the most out of this life! I think Socrates writings really inspired me. 'Let him that would move the world first move himself.' / 'The unexamined life is not worth living.' / 'To find yourself, think for yourself.'\n\nMy problem was, I would feel incredibly inspired by these things for about five minutes, and then start procrastinating again. Also, because of my sedentary lifestyle, I had become totally out of shape, and that would add to my depression. I am 26, and I felt like I could never get back into shape or get any self-discipline into my life. Whenever you think this way, remember that YOU have to push yourself, no one else is going to do it for you. \n\nWhat I did was, I downloaded an app called Simple Routine and set a bunch of inspiring quotes as daily reminders. Here are two of them that pop up on my lock screen around 5.30 each morning, when I wake up for the gym: \n\n'No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.' (Socrates)\n\n'For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' (Steve Jobs)\n\nI try to think about that a lot. If it were my last day here, what would I do? What would I do differently? What experiences would I want? Once you get into the habit of thinking like that, and make an exercise routine, you will start to feel better. You will become more disciplined, your productivity will go up, you'll start to look better, and your confidence will go up too. \n\nWhen we haven't done it, we try to build it up in our head as something really difficult or out of our ability. But it's really simple. Take it one step at a time. Don't treat it like some big experiment. Just start with small changes, and you'll get there. There's no need to stress. You have your whole life ahead of you and a lot of exciting experiences awaiting. All successful people have at some point fallen into the kind of abyss where you are right now. You sort of need that too I think, to start appreciating the good things about life. They all picked themselves up and managed to do great things with their lives, and so will you. \n\nAll the best!\n\nEDIT: Please excuse yourself from social media, except maybe Reddit which wouldn't make you feel awful about yourself. I did that and without it I don't think I would be able go fall into this routine.

You are going from a highly scheduled environment with planned activities and friends, to a very different, solitary \"adult\" life. You're supposed to know what you want to do and simply pursue it, but graduating is much more complicated than that. Your whole life, you have been working towards graduating and getting to the \"real world.\" However, school has not really prepared you for that. You've just spent 20 years of your life focusing on one goal and you did it! Pat yourself on the back for that! Now it is time to find new goals and to grow into the person you want to become.\n\nKnow that this is a normal transition time. Know that it is difficult for everyone. It is a huge life change.\n\nIf you can, start with some kind of counseling. You may feel like you don't need it, but it's important to make sure you don't sink into a more serious depression. Having someone to talk can be really helpful for moving forward.\n\nFocus on doing ONE new thing everyday. Start there. Go for a walk, get out of the house, read a page in a book/magazine. Spend time in your public library. Try a new food. Doing one thing is a small enough task that you will not get overwhelmed. This will help you grow and disrupt some of the habits you have now.\n\nRely on your loved ones for support. Use their energy to propel you out of the house. Help a relative with their grocery shopping, go with a friend to walk their dog, etc. Tag along. Someone else's momentum will help you get moving too.\n\nIndulge yourself with happy things. Listen to only happy music. Watch only happy TV or Movies. Avoid shows that will upset you or make you unhappy (including the news).\n\nRegulate or completely avoid social media until you heal. As Teddy Roosevelt said, \"Comparison is the thief of joy.\u201d\n\nTry to be present. Pay attention and indulge in things that lift you up. Ditch things that make you feel worse.\n\nPlease, please, please don't put pressure on yourself to change overnight. You need to heal and take care of yourself first.

I need to hand in a thesis proposal at the end of this month. I've barely thought about it.

I would say it's been a year now but I found some traction. Jordan Peterson is a professor in psychology, but he's a lot more than that. I highly recommend watching his lectures on maps and meaning, he was able to explain the state that I currently inhabit; which I found very enlightening. \nI've come to accept this period as one of self reflection and I guess questioned myself, my qualities, my values, my ambitions and generally what makes me me.\n\n I now know that this state comes about in stressful periods. I revert back to a very childish mind set and that was gaming. I didn't play for about 6 years. That changed and took hold. I guess what I'm trying to point out is that understanding your own behaviour helps you visualise your current state of being. For example: why do I play? Because it's fun and challenging. Why? Because it's competitive and I want to be the best. Why? I guess it's because being the best confirms your own ability. Etc.\nBut then the question: so why not apply that to your passion?\n\nThis is the big question, and the answer is that I should. Others may have fears like, it's hard work, too much time, what if I don't get a job etc. For me it's commitment and failure, my worst possible scenario is be a captain on a sinking ship. Yes there are a lot of metaphors in there but I'll leave at that. Well I hope this makes sense. \n\nMy brother had a good analogy. He suggested that we're all on the side of a cliff. There are those that jump, and fly. And there are those that stay. I never once perceived the world from the prospective and I guess it's spot on. Your fears are the things stopping you (and me) from taking the leap. Committing to the jump. Working hard to get there. Failure is an option, but not the final outcome.\n\nThis may get buried in the 230 + comments but here's my piece. Oh and Peterson has his book, in pdf form, for free.

It's important that you find a way to give yourself a rite of passage to commemorate and announce this big life change to yourself, and your subconscious.

That 30 days was the difference between me feeling completely lost and drifting to me feeling like I had a plan and was carrying it out. Once that was finished I worked for an outdoor school for a bit before I started college. I just finished my bachelors, only I'm in my middle 30's now.

The key is to do SOMETHING MEANINGFUL that gives you a sense of closure on the last 4-5 years of your life. It should honor the extreme effort and commitment that got you through your college years. And really ideally, it should have some relation, in some way either big or small, to your degree. It's just a way to validate your hard work to yourself, your subconscious, or whatever.\n\nFor example My NOLS trip was related to my military service because the group teamwork reminded me of what I loved about the military.

I've finished university this June, and the last semester was the most motivated and the happiest time in my life so far. I changed my lifestyle, started to work out daily and saw results, I was going to university lectures, languages classes and swing dance classes, and  also preparing for my exams, while doing a part-time job. Looking back, it seems like a lot, but back then, everything had its own place and time, and meaning. It kept me motivated and gave me so much energy there were days I just jumped out of bed and started doing what I have to do right away.\n\nAfter graduation, I succeeded in finding a job abroad as well, so in September I started working 40 hours a week. I was living in a dormitory before, so it's the first time I'm renting a flat and had my own room as well. It felt very good to have my first real job, but aside from that, my well balanced life with all the set, positive habits ceased to exist. It was shocking to experience how little time I had after work with all the household chores and cooking, and even in that little time I was browsing reddit on my phone mostly. I was floating somewhere between the tons of new paths I could have chosen from, with no directions, nothing to do, but I was so tired I couldn't bring myself to do anything.  I felt stuck in the same vicious circle every day, no matter what I planned, I just couldn't carry it out. I've experienced terrible mood swings. I'm still not over it fully yet, but it's getting better now. Here's what helped me:\n\n1) I started to get organized with my thoughts. I noticed that how imbalanced I was because of the constant noise in my head, and I was in denial when I started to put my attention to browsing the Internet and not to think about how to overcome this. So one day I forced myself to write everything down. Ideas, plans, fears, doubts, everything, then I examined them one by one and made some order. I decided to make it a habit: whenever something comes to my mind (something to buy or a promise to a friend I shouldn't forget about), I save it in Google Keep to the right list.\n\n2) I started to track my mood changes with a great app called Daylio. It helps to appreciate the little things more, also to start to see what's the connection between a bad day and your actions, which is motivating. It also draws a graph about your monthly mood swings, now it's more or less a constant up and down with hitting the bottom for me so far, but hey, at least I see I'm trying. I think it's the most important thing you should keep in mind: just know you're working on it and have at least part of control. \n\n3) Little by little, I returned to the habits that made me happy. I've found a good gym, started to attend to language classes again, made some time for meditation every day. I constantly remind myself of the person I was before this big shift happened, and tell myself I can do it again, but this is a next level and therefore, it needs a new approach.\nI started to listen to motivational podcasts at work, and try hard to make some time to do something meaningful day, every day, even if it's a little thing. New, productive habits grow from these seeds.\n\nStart small and be patient, the purpose is enough in the beginning, so you're on the right path, OP.

", "id": "da88zdg"}], [{"comment": "This sounds like something that is becoming more common these days (or perhaps it always was?) since I have also felt that way.  College was awesome because you could pursue your interests and to everyone else that was acceptable.  After college you are expected to find a career and work your ass off for the majority of your life, and most people don't get to pursue their interests like they could before.\n\nWork consumes your life.  There just isn't usually time for anything fun.  I found this incredibly unsatisfying, even when I finally got a job in the field I was hoping to break into.  It just wasn't good enough.  I was still doing menial things for hours on end sitting in front of a computer screen, only this time it was stuff I *had* to do, not stuff I *wanted* to do.\n\nThis all happened *after* I turned 30, after going back to school a *second* time to get a *second* bachelors degree in something different from what I learned the first time.  Now I'm switching gears *yet* ***again*** to go into a completely unrelated field where I'll be working with my hands instead of a computer, and I'm hoping to have the time in this career to fit those other interests into my schedule in a non-work related way.\n\nI don't know if this new path will work out or not, but now I'm in my early 30's, my friends are married and having kids and buying homes and cars, and I haven't even been able to save enough money to buy a new computer to replace my 6-year-old machine quite yet, let alone move out of my parents basement.  It's *incredibly* depressing, and that depression and anxiety about the future threatened to cripple me.\n\nI've wasted so many hours in this process just trying to escape from the depression of the realization that the real world sucks and doesn't care about me, that it has taken me until my 30's to get to a place where I think I can actually make it now.  Video games and TV and smoking weed were all wrapped into that process of escape.  After a while I think that even the games and shows started to lose their appeal though because I knew in the back of my mind that it was unsustainable.  Eventually I'd run out of money for food and weed and buying new games and such, and I had to figure things out... but it was just ***so*** hard to figure out what I wanted to do, since I knew that it was going to be a huge decision that would affect my life for years to come.  What if I made the wrong choice and regretted it?  Well making no choice at all was *also* the wrong choice as it turns out.\n\nI think having a plan now is helping a bit... I still suffer depression now and then, but for the first time in my life I'm thinking more than a couple of years down the road.  I have a girlfriend of 3 years who has been pretty supportive and we are hoping to move in together as soon as we can afford moving out of our parents' places.  Previously whenever I imagined the future, I didn't have any specific plan in place... I just figured I'd pursue a certain goal and hope that everything fell into place.  But then I would just end up procrastinating instead of pursuing that goal.  My current plan isn't exactly fully fleshed out and detailed or anything... but it at least considers the long term, and I can work out the finer details later.  I know the next few steps and I have accepted that whatever this career is like, I don't have to stick with it forever if I don't want to, it is okay to move again into something new.  That said, I will likely stick with this for a while at least, long enough to earn a decent living with it, and then maybe in another decade or so I will have enough financial stability in my life to switch things up again to pursue my ultimate goal.\n\nThis turned into quite a long story, but just wanted to add my experience to this post and show that it's okay to not know what to do with yourself sometimes.  I think we all experience that for a bit in our 20's and even into our 30's.  It's okay if you are behind where your friends are at.  It's okay if you have your midlife crisis at the age of 27... and then again at 33.  Nobody is going to decide your life for you, eventually you'll come to a breaking point where you are just going to have to go with something and hope for the best.  *That's* where real life outside of school actually begins.

You are chasing major gratification without taking joy from the simple things in life. Look into Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. These simple things are going to be a part of life, before and after, you accomplish your most rewarding gratifying goals. You need to learn to enjoy and seek reward from mundane tasks. You do these tasks because you value and take pride in yourself. \n\nI don't know Maslow's as well as I should, but I know the first level, being food, water, etc., we can assume to be covered. The second level is safety which is where we'll start. People don't spend enough time on safety, which is critical, because the next level is love and belonging. The quality of you safety you provide for yourself directly effects your transition into the third level. Safety covers things such as shelter, security, and health. What you seek is a quality life, so you have to create quality from the ground up. \n\nFor me, it started with flossing my teeth every day, I'd smell the floss after, realizing I'd bettered myself, I got a small ping of joy and satisfaction from the effort.

I set up my medicine cabinet and every morning I go through the same routine. \n\nThe third stage is no longer focusing on yourself but where you fit in. That is why quality of self is so important, because if you are shit then you're going to fit in with shit and vice versa.

People that you respect and respect you. \n\nThe fourth stage is the gratification you are trying to jump straight into.

Some people get motivation through inspirational writing. I like to give inspiration by giving people actionable steps to get out of their situations. So, here goes. \n\nWhen everything goes to hell and you feel like you can't juggle anything anymore, take a step back and take a deep breath. If you're a fan of stories, remember that the hero always goes through a period like this that tests everything that he/ she has and then some. It sucks and it can be brutal, but almost everyone in the world goes through something like this in one form or another. Viewing yourself as the hero of the story rather than the extra who gets punched in the face during the first battle scene can help with re-framing the struggle. \n\nThe first thing you want to do is take a look at your priorities. From what I saw in your post, you have a couple of problems that are facing you: weight gain, credit card debt, and a lower paying job that works you too hard. In dealing with this, you might want to consider which of these is a problem that you have the most control over. \n\nFor instance, you can't control what your shitty boss is going to say to you or make you do. You can keep submitting resumes and trying to find better work, but you can't guarantee that you're going to get a job offer immediately. So, we can accept that your work situation may remain unchanged for at least a little while. \n\nYour credit card situation sounds rough. Having to try to figure out how to pay minimum payments to a bunch of different cards is tricky, and often results in minimal progress being made on all of them. One tactic is to focus on one credit card to pay off first and dump all of your excess money at it until it's paid down, and then shift your focus onto the next one. It might generate late payments on the other cards, but it's one strategy to get rid of your debt one card at a time, instead of slowly paying off multiple ones over the course of a couple years. If you check out Ramit Sethi's book \"I will teach you to be rich\", he goes over different ways to talk to credit card companies to get them to lower your rates and waive late fees, which can be very helpful when you're strapped for cash.\n\nFinally, the weight gain you're experiencing could be a result of sleep loss, stress, or poor eating habits. I don't know which of these is applicable to your situation, but I highly recommend you check out the Slow Carb Diet (there's a great summary on medium: https://medium.com/@hellokip/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slow-carb-diet-a67062761d92#.1dtae18ck )\n\nThe stress and the sleep loss are harder to control, as they're influenced by your personal life, but if you simplify your diet at least, you should see some of those pounds start to come off. Also, start experimenting with cold showers. Anything below 57 degrees (F) for a couple of minutes will cause your body to release norepinephrine along with other hormones / chemicals that can vastly improve your mood and have been used as tools to fight depression. \n\nI'd also ditch the TV in favor of getting more exercise and working out more. It'll help stabilize your mood better, and your body will be more taken care of and better able to deal with the stresses of being in a crappy job and handling credit card debt. \n\nI've already gone way over what most people will take the time to read, but I hope this helps you with your situation.

And get yourself moving! 40 pounds is a lot, and with all that extra weight I'm not surprised you prefer being sedentary. \n\nTake this time to focus on you and focus on the now. If you can get yourself to a point where you are proud of your own progress it will shine through to people you meet. A get a hobby! I know this is easier said than done but it helps to occupy down time with something other than reruns and alcohol. \n\nI'm sure there is a sub somewhere on Reddit for easy to get into hobbies (or more challenging ones if you want!) \n\nSend a thank you card to the company you interviewed with. Ask them what it was that put you out of the running. Maybe that will give you an aim to improve on. And if you made it that far in an interview process, I'm betting they liked what they saw, but another candidate just fit better for some small reason or another. And that's fine. Keep an eye on openings there. \n\nAs for school, well maybe it would be a better time to cut down credit debt before taking on more debt. Set a budget and follow it.

Secondly, it's what's called a keystone habit, a good habit that helps you develop other good habits. This is for a lot of reasons, for example running primes your brain to learn new things, improves your mood, and makes you more motivated. Scientists theorize it's because that when people migrated to a new environment, they needed to learn how to adapt quickly. It just so happens it can help you adapt to most environments. This isn't like taking a pill though, you need to keep doing it consistent to reap the benefits. But doing this, I changed my whole life around. I always were about where you were, never did very good in high school. But in college I decided to change things around, and I feel running was a huge part of that. In fact, I hurt my foot last week and couldn't run for a while, and suddenly started getting way less done. I went for a run today and it was like a shot of confidence/motivation.

What I *will* tell you though is that it appears to me that your weighting on your \"ideal you\" seems to be placed too heavily, and that your perspective on life seems to be based mainly on *getting out* of your current position, not *getting into* a better one. Now, these two statements seem like complements to each other-- if you're not one, you're the other. Here's why this is not the case:\n\nWith \"getting out,\" there is only one option-- removing yourself from your job. However, it might be better for you, even if temporarily, to envision \"getting into\" one of many *good* situations in multiple aspects of your life. You have many paths to choose that can help you feel more fulfilled-- you've even provided a laundry list of these. Try to do the opposite of literally anything you've listed-- finish up some MBA classes, get a hobby, fuck, even watch a new show with a bottle of something you've never tried before (doesn't even have to be wine!). Go explore somewhere you've never been just for the fuck of it. Change any one thing of the list of grievances you have against yourself, and that in turn may set in motion events (physiologically & physically) that can improve your outlook, and thus your chances of improving the other aspects of life. \n\nHere's some brutal honesty for you: the job you thought you wanted might just be a fantasy. I mean, you took on a new job 2.5 years ago and thought a similar train of thought, which got derailed once your eyes were opened to the reality of it. I am not saying this to demean you or tell you that you are bad at making expectations-- I am saying this so you may stop thinking about how you were this and that back when you gave a fuck. Stop thinking about how your entire rebound is contingent upon the approval of a job offer from people who might even be just as lost personally as you are. You are you. Not your job, not your prescription bottle of wine, not your regularly scheduled program. \n\nSympathetically, I will say though that habit is a nasty creature. A real world solution: Take a week off of work. Use some PTO. What was your favorite place to go when you were younger? What dreams did you have then? Go back, and dream again. But don't dream with the mentality that you have to \"get out,\" dream as you did when there was nowhere to hide but everywhere to run.

I finally reached out and they said \"oh, we've hired someone else, sorry, and legit hung up.\" I was heart broken.

Every day it gets a little easier. But you got to do it every day. That's the hard part. But it does get easier.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2_Mn-qRKjA) - this quote from the show Bojack Horseman. There has never been a more perfect quote for quitting drinking that also relates to running, which is what I did almost two years ago. I stopped drinking and started running instead. Having goals that I had 100% control over and were entirely feasible gave me a lot more love for myself. Applying for a job is different because the decision is in someone else's hands. Maybe try picking a goal for yourself that can be achieved solely based on your efforts and work towards it day by day? It can be something small like jogging once a week or big like learning a new language. What have you always wanted to do but never achieved it? Don't think, just do.\n\n2) Make a gratefulness list. Every day if you can. List 1-3 things for which you are grateful, and try not to repeat anything. You might start with more superficial things like \"someone complimented me today\" and then find yourself writing down basics like \"clean water\" or \"having a mattress to sleep on\" and realize that no matter how shit your life may be, there are people out there who have less than you and you do still have things to be grateful for. This doesn't mean you're not allowed to have other feelings - you can be angry or depressed or feel that life is unfair, but mix in some gratefulness with it and watch as your attitude changes.\n\n3) Forgive yourself for your imperfections. I promise myself almost every day that I'm going to go running or go to sleep earlier and a lot of the times I don't fulfill the promise. I have a bad habit of comparing my current self to my former self as well - to the me that ran a half marathon and was in way better shape or the me that used to always hang out with way more friends. Maybe I'm not that person anymore but it's okay. We change. And there's always tomorrow to work towards being that again if that's what I really want.\n\nGood luck."], [2, "A year ago I was getting blackout drunk every night and I weighed about 175 pounds.

It's almost kind of creepy. \n\nI was crushed when I didn't get the job. But in retrospect, it did serve a purpose for me. All the time spent imagining what life would be like at that job gave me a clearer picture of what I felt an \"ideal\" job would be like. I took a step back and looked at what elements made that job seem so much more appealing than other similar jobs. When you were picturing yourself at that job, what did you find yourself thinking about the most or feeling the happiest about? I began the job search fresh, now prioritizing those specific elements. I ended up considering several jobs that I previously would have overlooked because they weren't exactly what I thought I should be doing at this point in my career. Five months after getting turned down from what I thought was my dream job, I was hired for a job I NEVER would have given a second thought before. And I love it! I fully credit my time spent contemplating the other job for giving me the motivation to give this one a chance. Honestly, I'm glad I was rejected, because where I am now is so much better-- and I never would have ended up here if I hadn't done so much rejection-fueled soul searching. \n\nI know that's all easy for me to say now that I'm on the other side of things, and your situation may be different than mine. But it's possible the job you thought would be a catalyst for change in your life might still be-- just in a different way than you assumed it would. \n\n\nAs for the weight issues, I had a lot of success (for pretty much the first time in my life) by following a ketogenic diet. The \"no idea how to correct what I've done, nor have the willpower\" thing sounds awfully familiar. I had basically given up hope of ever losing weight...then tried keto and lost 30lbs in 4 months while feeling amazing and eating a stupid amount of bacon. It may or may not be the right fit for you, but it made such a difference for me, I feel like I should at least suggest it. There's a lot of good info on r/keto if you're interested in giving it a try. Either way, following a solid nutrition-focused (not *just* for weight loss) way of eating makes far more difference overall than most of us really want to believe. It doesn't necessarily have to be something all that difficult to maintain (in fact, it *shouldn't* be, if you're doing it right), you just have to find the right balance that works for you and helps you feel your best. It gets a lot easier to make healthy decisions when you start to see the direct impact it has on how well you feel. \n\n\nI'm still working on the credit card debt and having hobbies/interests again after being a boring, empty shell of a person for so long.

Persistence *alone*.  Which means that no matter how terrible your life is, if you take steps to improve it, and you are persistent about it, you will succeed in some form.\n\nYou aren't motivated.  Honestly, despite how amazing this subreddit is, it's a lie that you need to be *motivated*.  You *don't* need to be motivated.  You have to just keep going, even if you don't want to.

No matter what.\n\nBe grateful you're not bankrupt.  Be grateful you don't have cancer.  Be grateful that you have a roof over your head that you're responsible for putting there, for earning.

Since July I've been slowly pulling myself back using a calorie-tracking app. (I personally use MyFitnessPal.) For me, it was a great way of taking things one day at a time. You set your goal, and have a daily goal to try to remain under, and can enter exercise and water consumption as well. At the end of the day, if you submit it, it gives you an estimate of where you'd be in 5 weeks if every day were like that day, and acknowledges if you stayed under your goal for the day. It tracks your progress and reminds you to log in, especially when you're on a streak. There's a lot of ways to find little victories in it. It can be hard to adjust diet but it gets easier. I would also recommend making sure you limit your eating hours, like eating only between 8am and 8pm. And even when I fall out of the diet a bit I make sure to enter things, because seeing where I'm at even when it isn't anything I feel proud of helps me control myself a bit. You won't lose 3 pounds a day, but if you can stick to it for a few weeks and log your progress you get to see a chart of it over time, which I find motivating and the pride helps me keep going.

The second level is safety which is where we'll start. People don't spend enough time on safety, which is critical, because the next level is love and belonging. The quality of you safety you provide for yourself directly effects your transition into the third level. Safety covers things such as shelter, security, and health.

Some people get motivation through inspirational writing. I like to give inspiration by giving people actionable steps to get out of their situations. So, here goes. \n\nWhen everything goes to hell and you feel like you can't juggle anything anymore, take a step back and take a deep breath. If you're a fan of stories, remember that the hero always goes through a period like this that tests everything that he/ she has and then some. It sucks and it can be brutal, but almost everyone in the world goes through something like this in one form or another. Viewing yourself as the hero of the story rather than the extra who gets punched in the face during the first battle scene can help with re-framing the struggle. \n\nThe first thing you want to do is take a look at your priorities. From what I saw in your post, you have a couple of problems that are facing you: weight gain, credit card debt, and a lower paying job that works you too hard. In dealing with this, you might want to consider which of these is a problem that you have the most control over. \n\nFor instance, you can't control what your shitty boss is going to say to you or make you do. You can keep submitting resumes and trying to find better work, but you can't guarantee that you're going to get a job offer immediately. So, we can accept that your work situation may remain unchanged for at least a little while. \n\nYour credit card situation sounds rough. Having to try to figure out how to pay minimum payments to a bunch of different cards is tricky, and often results in minimal progress being made on all of them. One tactic is to focus on one credit card to pay off first and dump all of your excess money at it until it's paid down, and then shift your focus onto the next one. It might generate late payments on the other cards, but it's one strategy to get rid of your debt one card at a time, instead of slowly paying off multiple ones over the course of a couple years. If you check out Ramit Sethi's book \"I will teach you to be rich\", he goes over different ways to talk to credit card companies to get them to lower your rates and waive late fees, which can be very helpful when you're strapped for cash.\n\nFinally, the weight gain you're experiencing could be a result of sleep loss, stress, or poor eating habits. I don't know which of these is applicable to your situation, but I highly recommend you check out the Slow Carb Diet (there's a great summary on medium: https://medium.com/@hellokip/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slow-carb-diet-a67062761d92#.1dtae18ck )\n\nThe stress and the sleep loss are harder to control, as they're influenced by your personal life, but if you simplify your diet at least, you should see some of those pounds start to come off. Also, start experimenting with cold showers. Anything below 57 degrees (F) for a couple of minutes will cause your body to release norepinephrine along with other hormones / chemicals that can vastly improve your mood and have been used as tools to fight depression. \n\nI'd also ditch the TV in favor of getting more exercise and working out more. It'll help stabilize your mood better, and your body will be more taken care of and better able to deal with the stresses of being in a crappy job and handling credit card debt. \n\nI've already gone way over what most people will take the time to read, but I hope this helps you with your situation.

Now, these two statements seem like complements to each other-- if you're not one, you're the other. Here's why this is not the case:\n\nWith \"getting out,\" there is only one option-- removing yourself from your job. However, it might be better for you, even if temporarily, to envision \"getting into\" one of many *good* situations in multiple aspects of your life. You have many paths to choose that can help you feel more fulfilled-- you've even provided a laundry list of these. Try to do the opposite of literally anything you've listed-- finish up some MBA classes, get a hobby, fuck, even watch a new show with a bottle of something you've never tried before (doesn't even have to be wine!). Go explore somewhere you've never been just for the fuck of it. Change any one thing of the list of grievances you have against yourself, and that in turn may set in motion events (physiologically & physically) that can improve your outlook, and thus your chances of improving the other aspects of life. \n\nHere's some brutal honesty for you: the job you thought you wanted might just be a fantasy. I mean, you took on a new job 2.5 years ago and thought a similar train of thought, which got derailed once your eyes were opened to the reality of it. I am not saying this to demean you or tell you that you are bad at making expectations-- I am saying this so you may stop thinking about how you were this and that back when you gave a fuck. Stop thinking about how your entire rebound is contingent upon the approval of a job offer from people who might even be just as lost personally as you are. You are you. Not your job, not your prescription bottle of wine, not your regularly scheduled program. \n\nSympathetically, I will say though that habit is a nasty creature. A real world solution: Take a week off of work. Use some PTO. What was your favorite place to go when you were younger? What dreams did you have then? Go back, and dream again. But don't dream with the mentality that you have to \"get out,\" dream as you did when there was nowhere to hide but everywhere to run. Then, pursue it *as an option* without hinging your life's wellbeing on it.\n\nGood luck, hope to see you at the top.", "id": "da6jlv5"}, {"comment": "Everyone has been so caring, so thoughtful, so passionate and so wonderful to me.

I've worked there for a while - and there comes a time where you realize your age and decide maybe it's time to move on from retail.  A certain pop culture website that was creating let's just say a BUZZ, was hiring. At this point I had worked at my store for about 8 years. Went through multiple interviews, even talked about pay(they brought it up not me) only to not hear from them for a month. I finally reached out and they said \"oh, we've hired someone else, sorry, and legit hung up.\" I was heart broken. At this point I had let a few of my closer work friends know, and then went back with my tail between my legs. Fast forward another year. The exact same thing happened. Met for an in person interview, even left my family who were visiting me at the time for the interview. Several weeks went by before I reached back out, in an email I was told they went with someone else. When I asked for feedback, I never heard anything. Two months later, I got another email saying they were going with someone else. I hadn't even applied for anything at that point. I took it as a sign. \n\nI went into work and spoke with my store leader, explaining that I felt stuck and I needed a change. She was extremely helpful and now has me doing things like training new hires, leading my team occasionally, etc. I just celebrated my 10th year at this place - and oddly enough - I'm actually looking forward to sticking around there. \n\nI guess my point is, life can really suck sometimes, it can kick you in the gut over and over, but sometimes, buried beneath all the other shit, the answer is right in front of you.  Try to find a few good things about your job, focus on those. I've had bosses that micromanage pretty hard - the way I handled it is by beating them to the point. Before I did things that I thought were important, ran it by them. When they started getting in my nerves, I just did my best to Chalk it up to them just being that way.  If they're open to feedback, or you feel safe doing so - let them know how it makes you feel, ask for a little bit of trust.\n\nI wish you good luck, we're all here for you on this journey.

But anyways.\n\nI was in a car crash 2 1/2 years ago. Okay, whatever. 1 month later I applied to a law enforcement department. A couple of months after that I woke up with a letter telling me that I was disqualified. I think it was hard and soft, for not putting the correct information I think. So I guess I was dishonest. 1 month after that my doctor took my license and told me that I should reconsider getting a PhD. \"My life would change dramatically. Prepare yourself.\" I was told I either had MS or a traumatic brain injury.\n\nOh wait, I forgot to mention. After the car crash I forgot how to untie my shoelaces. I remember that clearly.

I can't fully remember the end of 2014 and most of 2015. Oh yeah, also forgot whenever I walked into an elevator, small corridor, sat in a chair I would have panic attacks. I had one taking my polygraph, that was bad. I was offered a writing gig, great money, missed it by a few months.\n\nOne time a couple of month after the car crash , I was walking to class.

Every day it gets a little easier. But you got to do it every day. That's the hard part. But it does get easier.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2_Mn-qRKjA) - this quote from the show Bojack Horseman. There has never been a more perfect quote for quitting drinking that also relates to running, which is what I did almost two years ago. I stopped drinking and started running instead. Having goals that I had 100% control over and were entirely feasible gave me a lot more love for myself. Applying for a job is different because the decision is in someone else's hands. Maybe try picking a goal for yourself that can be achieved solely based on your efforts and work towards it day by day? It can be something small like jogging once a week or big like learning a new language. What have you always wanted to do but never achieved it? Don't think, just do.\n\n2) Make a gratefulness list. Every day if you can. List 1-3 things for which you are grateful, and try not to repeat anything. You might start with more superficial things like \"someone complimented me today\" and then find yourself writing down basics like \"clean water\" or \"having a mattress to sleep on\" and realize that no matter how shit your life may be, there are people out there who have less than you and you do still have things to be grateful for. This doesn't mean you're not allowed to have other feelings - you can be angry or depressed or feel that life is unfair, but mix in some gratefulness with it and watch as your attitude changes.\n\n3) Forgive yourself for your imperfections. I promise myself almost every day that I'm going to go running or go to sleep earlier and a lot of the times I don't fulfill the promise. I have a bad habit of comparing my current self to my former self as well - to the me that ran a half marathon and was in way better shape or the me that used to always hang out with way more friends. Maybe I'm not that person anymore but it's okay. We change.

It's almost kind of creepy. \n\nI was crushed when I didn't get the job. But in retrospect, it did serve a purpose for me. All the time spent imagining what life would be like at that job gave me a clearer picture of what I felt an \"ideal\" job would be like. I took a step back and looked at what elements made that job seem so much more appealing than other similar jobs. When you were picturing yourself at that job, what did you find yourself thinking about the most or feeling the happiest about? I began the job search fresh, now prioritizing those specific elements. I ended up considering several jobs that I previously would have overlooked because they weren't exactly what I thought I should be doing at this point in my career. Five months after getting turned down from what I thought was my dream job, I was hired for a job I NEVER would have given a second thought before. And I love it! I fully credit my time spent contemplating the other job for giving me the motivation to give this one a chance. Honestly, I'm glad I was rejected, because where I am now is so much better-- and I never would have ended up here if I hadn't done so much rejection-fueled soul searching. \n\nI know that's all easy for me to say now that I'm on the other side of things, and your situation may be different than mine. But it's possible the job you thought would be a catalyst for change in your life might still be-- just in a different way than you assumed it would. \n\n\nAs for the weight issues, I had a lot of success (for pretty much the first time in my life) by following a ketogenic diet. The \"no idea how to correct what I've done, nor have the willpower\" thing sounds awfully familiar. I had basically given up hope of ever losing weight...then tried keto and lost 30lbs in 4 months while feeling amazing and eating a stupid amount of bacon. It may or may not be the right fit for you, but it made such a difference for me, I feel like I should at least suggest it. There's a lot of good info on r/keto if you're interested in giving it a try. Either way, following a solid nutrition-focused (not *just* for weight loss) way of eating makes far more difference overall than most of us really want to believe. It doesn't necessarily have to be something all that difficult to maintain (in fact, it *shouldn't* be, if you're doing it right), you just have to find the right balance that works for you and helps you feel your best. It gets a lot easier to make healthy decisions when you start to see the direct impact it has on how well you feel. \n\n\nI'm still working on the credit card debt and having hobbies/interests again after being a boring, empty shell of a person for so long. The two concepts seem to be at odds with each other most of the time, and progress is slower than I'd like, but I'm getting there. I'm sure you will too, eventually.

There is *always* something to be grateful for, and the more you express gratefulness the more you will be able to handle where you're at.\n2.  It can always get better through persistence alone.  Persistence *alone*.  Which means that no matter how terrible your life is, if you take steps to improve it, and you are persistent about it, you will succeed in some form.\n\nYou aren't motivated.  Honestly, despite how amazing this subreddit is, it's a lie that you need to be *motivated*.  You *don't* need to be motivated.  You have to just keep going, even if you don't want to.  That's the secret to getting forward.  Persistence through everything, gratefulness for where you're at, and realizing that as long as you do these, you don't *have* to be motivated.  Just do.  No matter what.\n\nBe grateful you're not bankrupt.  Be grateful you don't have cancer.  Be grateful that you have a roof over your head that you're responsible for putting there, for earning.  What's the worst that could happen?  You keep being where you're at?  People live in circumstances infinitely worse than yours, and many of them can be grateful for what they have too.\n\nSecond, stop being so emotionally attached to these things.  Try to divorce yourself from them.  They're not *you*.  Your credit score isn't you.

Set fitness goals and meet them.\n3.  No booze (or one drink a day, or whatever you prefer)\n4.  Unplug your TV and give the cable to a friend for one week.  Before doing this make a list of what is valuable activity during the week.  Drawing, reading, going out and meeting people, trying new things.  Whatever they are, make a list, and be specific.  \n5.  Start networking for another job.  How many people have you been talking to in your industry?

If I work a lower amount of hours that I can sustain, I don't burn out, I am able to work smarter, and over a long period of time I will be more productive.\n\nA puritan work ethic is not something I am interested in having.
