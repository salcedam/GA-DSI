This resulted in a negative pressure difference (lower pressure inside compared to atmosphere). The materials wasn't strong enough to withstand the outside pressure and imploded. This is where the relief valve would be important\n\n>The pressure relief valve (PRV) is a type of valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system or which can build up for a process upset, instrument or equipment failure, or fire. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system.\n\nHere's a little animation that shows how it relieves pressure differences: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA3XUEIcXA0. Basically it adds or vents atmosphere depending on whether the pressure inside is too high or too low compared to the outside pressure.\n\nIf you want to see something similar at home, take an empty plastic water bottle and put it in the fridge.

It was a SUPER chill place.   Everyone was exceptionally laid back, and there was no drama.   Well the pod watched that episode when it aired , and maybe 5 mins later one of the black guys screamed  WHITE POWER!!!!!     Exactly the way they did in the episode.  Well a few mins later EVERYONE is yelling it.\n\nWHITE POWER!!!!   Became the standard greeting and goodbye of our pod,   If someone was leaving or coming back in,  it was guaranteed they would stand at the door raise a fist and scream it.\n\nFast forward a month or 2 down the road and I am getting shipped out,  back to Cincinnati.   At like 4 am,  via a prisoner transport company,   Transcor.\nWell they get me out of my cell,  then proceeded to  walk me to the door.   At the door I turned around raised a fist and yelled at the top of my lungs....   WHITE POWER!\nThe head Sheriff is one of the people taking me out and he turns and looks at me,  I point and at the windows of most every cell is a body staring back at me and the screams start.\nThe head Sheriff just stares in disbelief as 2 young black dudes and 2 mexicans are repeatedly screaming WHITE POWER,   fists in the air and everything.  Then the white guys join in.  Its 4 AM and it sounds like a Klan rally in there.\n\nThe Sheriff there was a humorous laid back guy, in his mid 50's and relatively distinguished looking.  Well I thought he was going to have an aneurysm at this point.  He goes beet red and starts shaking.  Im standing there with another C.O and both of us are just waiting for the explosion.    Then this gut busting HAWWW comes slipping out of the guy, and there is this head sheriff practically rolling around on the floor just busting a gut laughing, the poor guy is practically crying.\n\n\nThey lead me out,  and of course they pepper me with questions.  And my response is still talked about in that town to this day.  \n\n\n\"We are an equal opportunity hate group,  We will take anyone as long as it furthers the white agenda\"\n\n\nWhats the white agenda?\n\n\n\"Fuck wheat bread!

The gut reaction was fear or hostility. As humanity expanded and formed more advanced cultures, so did this idea in a more \"refined\" fashion (barbarians, etc.). However, in this day and age, most people (particularly in urban environments) are exposed to any number of cultures and peoples, as well as ideas of multiculturalism, so the \"threat\" is mostly nullified except is isolated, homogeneous communities that become echo chambers for rhetoric building off of this feeling... or societies that classify different races as \"alien\" to the point that they no longer resemble the \"true\" citizens, for some other purpose (generally political). On the latter, think Japan towards non-ethnic Japanese, the US towards Latino immigrants, or some of western Europe's response to Eastern European workers.\n\nOf course, racism became a \"science\" starting in the age of exploration for justification of any number of awful things, but some people think it's just an extension of that initial, uncomfortable awareness of \"the other\" from our early days. \n\nBut I'm no scientist, just an amateur cultural theorist, so take that as you will.", "id": "dam06ba"}, {"comment": "Racism isn't something unique it's all part of the same thing.

Even their positions on the roost bars are more or less interchangeable. It's really only a big deal if #50 tries to take #3's spot, or some similarly massive leap.\n\nHope that makes sense. Random anecdote time: two Araucana hens I had the privilege of raising seemed to actually become friends. I saw those two hanging out all the time, roaming over a five acre farm always by one another's side. They even had a special meeting spot by a barn door entrance where they'd begin the day together; one hen was faster than the other, so when the coop door opened up in the morning she'd race to their spot and just wait there until the other caught up, at which point they'd both begin the day's foraging. I kept thinking for sure it was just a fluke, but the same interaction kept playing out day after day. Hen 1 genuinely seemed adverse to going out foraging before Hen 2 had caught up.\n\n...unfortunately, this story doesn't have a happy ending. One of the hens was nabbed by a fox one autumn, and I swear to you, the other hen noticed she was gone. I heard a unique squawking I'd never heard before coming from their meeting place at the barn, and sure enough, it was one of the two friends standing there squawking at the top of her lungs, the other hen nowhere to be seen.

Observation of male wolves dominating other male wolves in packs almost always turns out to be the parent wolf getting ready to chase off a maturing male offspring who's ready to go form his own pack and is similar to other parent canines disciplining their offspring. Pecking order isn't really as rigid as it has been conveyed in popular media when it comes to wolves.\n\nI am not sure whether lion hierarchy is similarly misunderstood or not, I only know about wolves.

Now, years later, I almost always try and have a person, whether it be friends, family or myself, in the foreground and tend to look back at them more often.\n\nThe one point I'll concede is that I don't take them to mass share online.
