Had more than the lethal dose of heroine in his system. \n>2. \"shot himself\" in an unnatural way (can't remember if it was the wrong hands or an unusual angle, etc) \n>3. The \"suicide\" letter pen was wiped clean of finger prints\n>4. He had recently written about how much he loved his daughter, wanted to turn things around for her,  and expressed, to some extent leaving Courtney.\n\n\\#1 doesn't immediately seem implausible because he could've killed himself before the heroin had a chance to kill him (i.e. his body hadn't processed it fully). Maybe if he had waited it would've killed him eventually from overdose, but perhaps he overdosed on purpose since he was planning on killing himself anyway.\n\nI remember hearing a rumor sorta similar to #2, that he had shot himself by putting the shotgun on the ground, aiming it up into his mouth, and then pulling the trigger with his toe or something like that because the shotgun was too long to hold and fire at himself with his own arms. Maybe that's where it came from?\n\n\\#3 is definitely one of those things I'd ask for actual proof on. \"wiped clean of prints\" sounds like something that originally was probably \"police couldn't find a clear print on it\" which then has gotten corrupted and misunderstood over the years. From what I understand fingerprinting in general, when it comes to forensics, isn't as clean cut or reliable as what you see on TV. Something like a pen seems like it'd be a nightmare to \"get prints\" off of in any situation. Plus I'd wonder why anybody would be questioning whether Cobain's prints were on the pen in the first place; assuming the suicide note was in his handwriting then I'm not sure what the implication would be here.\n\n\\#4 other people have already commented on, but to repeat: plenty of people will say/do/plan big long-term things and then immediately turn around and kill themselves. Cobain having \"recently written\" about those kinds of things doesn't make it any less likely for him to have killed himself later on, it just makes it more tragic. People change their minds.

The game about the game."], [2, "\"Metagame\" is \"the game outside the game\". It describes all of the strategies in a game, and which of them are weak or strong in relation to which other strategies. A \"meta strategy\" is a strategy selected based on the state of the metagame, with the intent being not to just choose the most objectively powerful strategy, but to choose the one with the best matchups against the expected field.\n\nFor example, consider a variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors where Paper only beats Rock 90% of the time. This variant is played in special, single-elimination tournaments, where each competitor is required to choose one sign\u2014Rock, Paper or Scissors\u2014at the start of the tournament, and play only that sign in all of their matches. The outcome of draws is decided at random.\n\nNow, in a vacuum, the best sign is clearly Rock. It has a 100% matchup against Scissors, a 50% matchup against itself, and a 10% matchup against Paper\u2014it's the only sign with a chance to win in every matchup. Compare Scissors, which has the normal distribution (100% against Paper, 50% against itself, 0% against Rock) and Paper, which doesn't even have *any* guaranteed winning matchups (90% against Rock, 50% against itself, 0% against Scissors)!\n\nHowever, if you're attending a tournament, it would be a mistake to choose Rock. Why? Because if it's the most powerful sign, everybody will be choosing it\u2014so its average matchup against the field will only be 50%. The best sign to choose if you want to win the tournament is actually Paper\u2014the objectively *weakest* sign.\n\nIf everybody else at the tournament is choosing Rock because it's the strongest, then a 0% matchup against Scissors doesn't matter. A 50% mirror matchup doesn't matter. All that matters is a 90% matchup against the most prevalent sign, Rock\u2014a win rate that puts Scissors' 0% and Rock's 50% to shame. While Rock is objectively the best sign, Paper is the \"meta sign\".\n\nIf enough players pick up on this dynamic, Paper may become the most represented sign at tournaments. In this case, this would cause a shift in the metagame, as the more canny players would start choosing Scissors, and dominating tournaments using its 100% matchup against Paper. Scissors would become the new \"meta sign\". (Or, perhaps more accurately, the \"anti-meta sign\"\u2014a strategy selected for its ability to beat the strategy which is best against the rest of the field. This distinction is important in games with more complex metagames involving more than three strategies.)\n\nEverything I just described about the three different signs in this variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors, their relative strengths, and the best strategies for tournaments based on that, is collectively a description of the \"metagame\" for that game.

A \"meta strategy\" is a strategy selected based on the state of the metagame, with the intent being not to just choose the most objectively powerful strategy, but to choose the one with the best matchups against the expected field.\n\nFor example, consider a variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors where Paper only beats Rock 90% of the time. This variant is played in special, single-elimination tournaments, where each competitor is required to choose one sign\u2014Rock, Paper or Scissors\u2014at the start of the tournament, and play only that sign in all of their matches. The outcome of draws is decided at random.\n\nNow, in a vacuum, the best sign is clearly Rock. It has a 100% matchup against Scissors, a 50% matchup against itself, and a 10% matchup against Paper\u2014it's the only sign with a chance to win in every matchup. Compare Scissors, which has the normal distribution (100% against Paper, 50% against itself, 0% against Rock) and Paper, which doesn't even have *any* guaranteed winning matchups (90% against Rock, 50% against itself, 0% against Scissors)!\n\nHowever, if you're attending a tournament, it would be a mistake to choose Rock. Why? Because if it's the most powerful sign, everybody will be choosing it\u2014so its average matchup against the field will only be 50%. The best sign to choose if you want to win the tournament is actually Paper\u2014the objectively *weakest* sign.\n\nIf everybody else at the tournament is choosing Rock because it's the strongest, then a 0% matchup against Scissors doesn't matter. A 50% mirror matchup doesn't matter. All that matters is a 90% matchup against the most prevalent sign, Rock\u2014a win rate that puts Scissors' 0% and Rock's 50% to shame. While Rock is objectively the best sign, Paper is the \"meta sign\".\n\nIf enough players pick up on this dynamic, Paper may become the most represented sign at tournaments. In this case, this would cause a shift in the metagame, as the more canny players would start choosing Scissors, and dominating tournaments using its 100% matchup against Paper. Scissors would become the new \"meta sign\". (Or, perhaps more accurately, the \"anti-meta sign\"\u2014a strategy selected for its ability to beat the strategy which is best against the rest of the field. This distinction is important in games with more complex metagames involving more than three strategies.)\n\nEverything I just described about the three different signs in this variant of Rock-Paper-Scissors, their relative strengths, and the best strategies for tournaments based on that, is collectively a description of the \"metagame\" for that game. Within that metagame, Rock is the best strategy and Paper is the \"meta strategy\" (and Scissors is the \"anti-meta strategy\").", "id": "daom5b5"}], [{"comment": "\"Flavor of the month\" is another way to say it--its the heroes and the strategies that are effective at the time, so many people use them.

If you are walking along a path next to water, you don't want the pokemon to appear too far away from the user, to make them want to walk somewhere they shouldn't, like into the water.

If it comes back ABC123, then you know it's genuine. If you hash it and it comes back ZFR729, then you know the file has been edited. ", "id": "dak041x"}, {"comment": "Wrote a little bit in the comments below but thought I'd answer your question directly. \n\nFor all of my examples below were going to ignore quotes. \n\nLet's start with a password. \n\nLet's say that you have a password of \"HELLO\" and let's use a very poor algorithm of ROT13. This algorithm is easy enough to do in our heads and the rule is that we take a letter and replace it with whatever letter is 13 letters away in the alphabet.  \n\nSo for example A becomes N. B becomes O. C becomes P. When we have a letter that goes past Z we just wrap around. So for example M becomes Z. But N becomes A. \n\nSo using our password we'll encrypt it. \nH => U\nE => R\nL => Y\nL => Y\nO => B\n\nURYYB is our encrypted value. Now with encryption you can also decrypt the value to get back the original. So using URYYB we just reverse the process by going back 13 letters (although due to 26 letters in the alphabet rot13 works going forward 13 as well)\n\nU => H\nR => E\nY => L\nY => L\nB => O\n\nEncryption is useful when you want to transmit or store data but the receiver needs to be able to use the data. So, for example, Amazon stores your credit card information encrypted so when you make a purchase they can decrypt it and send the necessary data for processing the funds. \n\nNow hashing is different. It's a one way process that isn't meant to be reversible but rather allow you to verify that something is complete or hasn't been tampered with. \n\nLet's say you have a phrase \"hello world\". \n\nAnd let's make a quick and easy hashing algorithm. We'll take each letter and the one that follows it, get the ascii for it and then add them together. Continuing on to the end. \n\nSo h has an ascii value of 104, e 101, space 32 and so on. I won't go into detail on ascii as you can read more about it on Wikipedia, etc. \n\n\"hello world\" then gives us the following \n104 101 108 108 111 32 119 111 114 108 100\n\nSo let's hash this. \n104 + 101 = 205\n205 + 108 = 313\n313 + 108 = 421\n421 + 111 = 532\n532 + 32 = 564\n564 + 119 = 684\n684 + 111 = 794\n794 + 114 = 908\n908 + 108 = 1016\n1016 + 100 = 1116\n\nSo our very simple hash of \"hello world\" is 1116. As long as we put in \"hello world\" we will get 1116. If we change a single letter the results will change. \n\nHowever. There's no way to take 1116 and get our phrase back. We can't determine which letters were added together to make this number. It's a one way operation. \n\nIn a good hash you won't have collisions which our simple algorithm will have. A collision is a series of changes that will cancel each other out and result in the same hash. For example swapping letters will get you the same hash here. In a better algorithm it wouldn't. \n\nHashes are great for password storage because the user will present you a password and you can hash it and then compare the results. If the hash is 1116 does that match what you have stored?  This is 'more' secure but not a panacea as there are ways of cracking hashes. Usually by computing lots of passwords and getting the hashes. This way the results can be compared to what is stored. General rule of thumb is that nothing is perfect and this stuff is hard to get right. \n\nSo back to your question.  Let's say that I call you and say that I have a document of yours. And you want proof. I can run our algorithm and will get the same hash you get. If I can give you the hash then I have what I said I have. Zip them up info a archive. Hash that and it's the same thing. I have a way of verifying/confirming the contents because we both get the SMS results. If I don't, then either I don't have it or the contents have been changed. \n", "id": "dak7tlv"}, {"comment": "In a game called Europa Universalis 4, every time you open the game it creates a checksum to see if the game has been altered and to see if you can join a multiplayer lobby.

This doesn't tell anybody any details, but the next morning Senator Blowhard is on the phone to the CIA begging them not to arrest you after all.\n\nAnother use is this: Wikileaks releases some files.

Most people around here have a connection to social media that would go as deep as shitty news articles shared on the facebook page they check once or twice a week. At least around here, rural folks tend more towards traditional media and discussion, local or partisan radio, newspapers, in-person discussion during mealtime gatherings at local mom'n'pops and greasy spoons.\n\nI would argue that \"meme magic\" was tapping into feelings and pop-culture potential that were already there. The 4chan, reddit, et. al. meme campaigns were riding the wave of everything else happening in the public eye.

If reddit or 4chan had a virtual white house then that's what it won. It won the white house in the eyes of people who spend much more time interacting with social media and have their view of the world colored by that, but a lot of the votes that went in actual ballot boxes weren't driven by \"meme magic\" as other factors were much more influential to the voting demographics.\n\nThere are some other solid points here about the media focus on Trump being a core part of the DNC campaign strategy, and that likely had even more of an impact on rural voters than some of the factors I brought up, but seeing as how that didn't intend to win the white house in the way that it arguably did, and those users who brought that up covered anything I'd say then you should just read their posts for that.", "id": "damzg7t"}, {"comment": "I really don't know how else to say it.

First, for the past few years it has become easier and easier to make fake news stories because more news is being shared peer-to-peer.  Consider the nonsense chain letters that were (and still are, I guess) shared via email when it was new.  Quite a few were just blatantly false myths and other nonsense.  But not much fake news, because the format of email didn't mimic news stories and nobody was used to getting their news from the internet.  Now we do get our news from the internet, and facebook and other social media allow the sharing of websites that have exactly the same _format_ as real news stories but totally invented content. \n\nAll this has been churning for at least half a decade, but it's only coming out now because of reason b) it's political season.  Fake news usually doesn't _matter_.  People may think chocolate cures cancer or Elvis was sighted in Egypt but it doesn't really affect the way society is run in a large way.  It doesn't much matter what people think about those things, and only a few are interested in the first place.

People judge them not just on what they actually say or do, but on totally made-up stories that just sound appealing or appalling enough to get spread around a lot.  \n\nSo the phenomenon has been getting more common and having more impact, somebody slapped a catchy name on it, and here we are.", "id": "dalnhla"}, {"comment": "A bunch of people around the world figured out that you could put up a fake site that sorta looked like a news site, and fabricate stories that would \"push the buttons\" of gullible/outraged right-wing folks, and they'd click through getting you ad revenue and/or share the bullshit on Facebook, similarly getting you ad revenue.

This is a common misconception.\n\n1) countries need to make investments in their own citizens, infrastructure, etc. Since population tends to grow over time as does inflation, taking on debt is a practical move. When you have credit card debt, you can't count on a growing household of income earners and household inflation to ease your pain over time. Countries can. Taking on national debt can be seen as like taking out a college loan for a kid who will stay in your household and add income to your own household, rather than move out. It might cost you, but it's totally worth it.\n\n2)When economies are stagnant, it's even more crucial to invest in order to jumpstart them. When the private sector is leery of spending money and corporations are sitting on vast amounts of cash without using it to hire, then it's up to governments to step in and stimulate the economy when the private sector won't.\n\n3) Right now because of low interest rates debt is incredibly cheap. It's stupid for countries to be stingy about debt right now. It's smarter to take on debt now when money is cheap and the economy is bad, then pay it off later when interest rates rise, money is expensive, and the economy doesn't need as much stimulus.\n\n4) Yes, too much debt can lead to high interest payments which can screw you if your debt-to-GDP ratio is too high. But comparatively very strong economies like Germany and the USA aren't in remotely any danger of that, and even countries with lesser economies have a variety of strategies to deal with it, including loose monetary policy, strategic inflation, and requesting debt forgiveness. Keep in mind that foreign creditors don't want their debtors to go bankrupt as that drags down everyone's economy. Unlike predatory lenders and credit card companies that will totally drive you to bankruptcy, it's not in any country's interest that any other country's economy go belly up.\n\n5) Unlike when you owe money to a credit card company, when nations owe money to each other it's not a zero sum game. If every country decided to balance their budgets and clean their debts, the world would go into a massive economic depression. As in business, capital finances investment, and debt is a vehicle of growth. If the U.S. suddenly stopped borrowing from China or China stopped lending, both the U.S. and Chinese economies would go bust.\n \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/5f0egv/what_is_rthe_schulz_and_why_is_it_starting_to/dahb5nc", "id": "dahg23l"}, {"comment": "most people don't realize that most of that \"debt\" is debt we owe not to other countries, but to ourselves in the form of bonds and social security payments.

As it happens, America's debt-to-GDP is pretty standard both historically and compared to other major world economies.\n\nThe number you should be a bit more worried about is the trade deficit, which represents how much money outflow we're sending as we consume what other countries produce.", "id": "dahitbx"}, {"comment": "> What matters isn't the raw figure of the debt, but the ratio of the debt to GDP. \n\nProvided US GDP numbers have some bearing to US debt paying capabilities.\n", "id": "dahnn4u"}, {"comment": "not the same user, but most economists agree it's better to spend a lot on services for your citizens than try and run a budget with no debt. no debt sounds nice, but it doesn't do anything to improve the lives of your citizens", "id": "dah5vow"}, {"comment": "> debt\n\nDoesn't accumulating debt lead to greater and greater interest payments over time, which would be a negative?", "id": "dah9uzj"}, {"comment": "yes and no, but mostly no. This is a common misconception.\n\n1) countries need to make investments in their own citizens, infrastructure, etc. Since population tends to grow over time as does inflation, taking on debt is a practical move. When you have credit card debt, you can't count on a growing household of income earners and household inflation to ease your pain over time. Countries can. Taking on national debt can be seen as like taking out a college loan for a kid who will stay in your household and add income to your own household, rather than move out. It might cost you, but it's totally worth it.\n\n2)When economies are stagnant, it's even more crucial to invest in order to jumpstart them. When the private sector is leery of spending money and corporations are sitting on vast amounts of cash without using it to hire, then it's up to governments to step in and stimulate the economy when the private sector won't.\n\n3) Right now because of low interest rates debt is incredibly cheap. It's stupid for countries to be stingy about debt right now. It's smarter to take on debt now when money is cheap and the economy is bad, then pay it off later when interest rates rise, money is expensive, and the economy doesn't need as much stimulus.\n\n4) Yes, too much debt can lead to high interest payments which can screw you if your debt-to-GDP ratio is too high. But comparatively very strong economies like Germany and the USA aren't in remotely any danger of that, and even countries with lesser economies have a variety of strategies to deal with it, including loose monetary policy, strategic inflation, and requesting debt forgiveness. Keep in mind that foreign creditors don't want their debtors to go bankrupt as that drags down everyone's economy. Unlike predatory lenders and credit card companies that will totally drive you to bankruptcy, it's not in any country's interest that any other country's economy go belly up.\n\n5) Unlike when you owe money to a credit card company, when nations owe money to each other it's not a zero sum game. If every country decided to balance their budgets and clean their debts, the world would go into a massive economic depression. As in business, capital finances investment, and debt is a vehicle of growth.

Greece needed new EU funds, but with those funds came \"austerity\" measures, i.e. stop spending and zero debt policies. The AfD were initially a party of economics professors which criticized the ministre of finance Sch\u00e4uble for his zero debt policy. There are some speeches by Bernd Lucke, the founder of the AfD and head till their falling out in 2014, where he calls for debt relief for Greece, and wanting them to leave the euro. Another point for them was that all the rules for the euro, to which the countries subjected themselves, were constantly broken without consequences. And Greece even fixed their books just to be able to join the euro. This was all in their economic agenda, at least in the early days of the AfD.\n\nThen there was a falling out between Bernd Lucke and Frauke Petry, after which Lucke left the party, and founded Alpha.

The irc protocol is pretty lightweight and it does not support any form of persistent messages (i.e. messages don't get stored). In order to get around this, a lot of irc channels have a bot set up that logs the various conversations taking place on their channel. For instance, [this](https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2016/12/04/%23ubuntu.html) is the log of the #ubuntu channel on freenode (plain text format is also available if you don't like the layout/colors). If you google for it, you'll probably find plenty of bots that can log irc channels.\n\nThe reason that all of this information is useful is because slack is [easily accessible over irc](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connect-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP). Thus, it is possible to add a \"logbot\" (or whatever you want to call it) user to your slack, which can join over IRC and log any message that was sent to some file.

Discord has a better voice system, and you have one account that can have friends.\n\nSlack doesn't have as good a voice/channel system going, and your locked into one group.. which can get annoying.\n\nOtherwise, I would argue Slack has better UX. The Slack group at my office has ~150 people and ~130 channels, but I only am aware of 20 people and 15 channels. \n\n~~In Discord, whenever someone creates a channel, i'm just part of it. I have to go in and eventually mute the channel if it's a topic I don't  care about. I also see the entire list of users online. So here, Slack does a really good job keeping only the people/channels that you care about in your view (along with starring channels, notification settings even as basic as they are)~~\n\nThe \"extras\" on talking are also generally better with Slack. They both have the (really useful) [markdown](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-) [formatting](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages), but Slack also lets you post snippets or posts. This lets me dump a shitload of code or a big document into a chat and let others see/comment on it, without taking up the whole chat when I post it.\n\nWith Slack you can \"pin\" posts to the channel. So like, useful links on how to run your app, faq's, url's that are commonly used...\n\nThe emoticon responses are silly, but it really does lessen the amount of messages sent once people get used to it. Discord recently added these in, ~~but you can't add your own memes yet :p~~\n\nMulti-DM's are a personal favorite. It's a great way to have a quick conversation with very specific people, not bug everyone, and keep it private. (EDIT: Apparently both Slack and Discord have this feature!)\n\nFinally, Integrations. As far as I can tell, Slack has a number of pre-existing integrations (like Bitbucket, Jenkins, Jira, etc), that discord does not.\n\nSlack is definitely the superior tool for an office. I think Slack is finally getting that too, with their recent agreement updates and upcoming Enterprise level. It makes sense too...

You don't have logs, you don't have control over uptime, you don't have control over security\n\nFact! We operate your servers on a distributed cloud network that hides all sensitive information and is optimized to keep you as close to 100% up time as possible. You don't need to have control over uptime/security because we handle it at a scale much larger than any individual server would invest in. [Learn more about the backend voice infrastucture here that keeps you online.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZiOUel0IZ0)\n\nThere are no logs yet, though. That part is true. I think there are third party ways to archive text chat. Don't quote me on that :)\n\n>How decently can we recover if our server is crashing due to DDOS attempts?\n\nAs I just mentioned, that's not how our backend works. You are unable to be directly attacked. We proxy all of that. Watch above video.\n\n>Why is Discord able to be free.... will we be shutdown...\n\nCurrently we're [investor backed](https://blog.discordapp.com/11-million-players-in-one-year/) and plan on monetizing experiments early next year.

Hell that's not even all that accurate as the Allies won, but then there is the whole debate about who really wins at all in war...\n\nPoint being, study has shown that as many as 13% of illegal aliens claim to have voted in previous elections. That's 13% of what we guesstimate is something like 12 million people. The study isn't secret knowledge, so it doesn't require citation in that situation. The message you mention is about the voting patterns of people in the US and so people with basic knowledge in that field are or should be aware that illegal aliens make such claims. Of course none of it is verifiable because we cast secret ballots as citizens, but not all states verify identity let alone citizenship when you vote. It is possible that, based on the claims of the group in question, as many as 1.56 million votes were cast by illegal aliens. If what we have been told about how communities which contain large chunks of the illegal alien population, I could assume a 2:1 ratio at least in support of Clinton over Trump in that voting demographic, assuming our Russian illegal aliens and many of the Asian ones vote Trump and the Hispanics vote as lock step as the media thinks they do.\n\nI don't have a strong belief on these numbers because, short of the 13% figure, I haven't seen anything academic on how illegal alien voters direct their vote. If I'm half right though, then the popular vote of legitimate votes would also be for Trump.\n\nI've heard estimates in the millions, as many as 3 million, for total illegal alien voters, and if the 13% figure is applied to and estimated population of 23 million illegal aliens, then that would yield such a number. Some estimates do suggest as many as 25 million illegal aliens exist in America, but I don't believe it is that high. \n\nAll of that is based on some simple truths, study, the illegal alien population total, and what we can infer about their presidential vote based on the general belief that Trump would make their lives harder.

It is unlikely that the recounts will have any [serious changes](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/recounts-rarely-reverse-election-results/) in results for the Electoral College. \n\nIn any case, the results from any such recount need to be finalized soon.   There are State and Federal laws that require a date of December 13 for final certification, and the Electors have to meet and cast a first vote on [December 19](https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/key-dates.html).   \n\nThe States don't take recount requests lightly.  It takes a lot of money and manpower, and it questions the original system's effectiveness/legitimacy.   Stein has been raising filing fees just to petition these States to recount.   \n\nThere are allegations of some hacking, some mistakes, and voter disenfranchisement.  Whether a recount can prove/disprove these claims, or change the result at all will remain to be seen. \n\nIn my humble opinion, it is probably good that we examine the system periodically, and this provides the circumstances allowing us to do that.

Japanese Internet was much more privacy-focused back then which was also culture-related. The Japanese have a very \"fit in\"-type of culture (look up *tatemae* and *honne* if you will) and the anonymous boards were a means to an end for people to speak their own minds without fear of societal repercussions for not confirming to the status quo.\n\nNow 2chan was very focused on the nerd culture of Japan, attracting gamers, anime fans and the like, and 4chan tried to emulate that.

Keep in mind that 4chan is very much fragmented, similar to Reddit but not so much. Reddit has thousands of subs, 4chan only has a handful of boards, but when someone says that they've \"seen some shit\" they usually refer to posts on /b/, the random board, which is pretty much a catch-all for posts that don't fit anywhere else. Every board has its own culture and they are, again much like Reddit, grouped into SFW and NSFW boards, /b/ of course being part of the latter. /b/'s premise is that \"nothing here should be taken seriously,\" so while you see some really weird stuff there, you must keep in mind that most of it is likely tongue-in-cheek, although there have been moments where people did actually post sketchy shit like videos where they themselves torture animals or even pictures of people they allegedly murdered. These posts usually don't fare very well even with /b/, though. Think of it as a giant circlejerk you're not supposed to break. Everyone there is a lonely kissless nerd virgin who hates everything, calls everyone a faggot and lives in their mom's basement. If you break the jerk you're a normie (normal person who does not fit into the average userbase) and are treated as such. \n\nTruth is, the userbase of 4chan is not very different from Reddit. If you take a look into some other boards this becomes very clear. /fit/ or example is for sports and fitness and you'll see people working out and sharing progress pictures that do not at all fit with the Doritos and chicken tendies eating stereotypes. /ck/ is for cooking and you see people having really nice kitchens there. /wg/ is for wallpapers and desktops (battle stations) and it's clear that they are not all basement stations.

But then I think it gradually changed to a stronger focus on the characteristics of the poster, the idea that 4chan is specifically a site for virgins and losers and normies should go elsewhere, even if they\u2019re up to speed with the culture. Obviously a lot of this is expressed in a tongue-in-cheek way but it undoubtedly arises out of genuine sentiment. I think /r9k/ accelerated this process the most: it was the first non-/b/ off-topic board and so was the first proper opportunity for users to really consider each other\u2019s personal lives and opinions in detail. And like any site it then hive-minded in one direction, in this case the \u201canti-normie\u201d one \u2013 people realised the sorts of things a lot of them had in common and that inevitably began to reinforce itself.

Moderation is lax and trolling, banter and politically incorrect language is a major selling point.\n\nThere's arguably 3 boards that define 4chan's image to the outside world - /b/, which is all edgy and random humour and memery; /pol/, which is political board where anyone can express politically incorrect opinions which makes it a popular hangout place for fringe groups and /r9k/ where most miserable people gather.\n\nNormies are the outsiders, who live in politically correct environment, don't intricate understanding of rare pepes and other everyday struggles of anononymous culture. \n\nBut as I said, ironic posting, trolling and falsehood are widespread on the site and more mainstream communities and especially real life media just don't get the meme culture.

Before then (again, this is a massive generalisation) the bar you had to clear to be accepted on the site was basically: had you lurked moar, did you understand all the memes and in-jokes, etc. What sort of person you were wasn\u2019t so important \u2013 and anyway everybody was all anonymous, blah blah. But then I think it gradually changed to a stronger focus on the characteristics of the poster, the idea that 4chan is specifically a site for virgins and losers and normies should go elsewhere, even if they\u2019re up to speed with the culture. Obviously a lot of this is expressed in a tongue-in-cheek way but it undoubtedly arises out of genuine sentiment. I think /r9k/ accelerated this process the most: it was the first non-/b/ off-topic board and so was the first proper opportunity for users to really consider each other\u2019s personal lives and opinions in detail. And like any site it then hive-minded in one direction, in this case the \u201canti-normie\u201d one \u2013 people realised the sorts of things a lot of them had in common and that inevitably began to reinforce itself. And then you had spin-off imageboards like Wizardchan which were never large or popular, but which developed certain influential concepts in the anti-normie direction, which then filtered back onto 4chan.

True globalization probably started in the 18th-19th centuries and refers to the spread of integrative political/economic/social/cultural exchange. Colonialism/ the age of exploration were the prime movers in the rise of globalization, and the later introduction of advanced communication technologies accelerated globalization considerably.\n\nIn the 21st century we see can see multiple examples of globalization:\n\nPolitical economy: The Bretton Woods system (IMF,GATT,  WTO etc...), OPEC, G10...\n\nForeign political relations: the U.N, the EU...\n\nMilitary: NATO, Warsaw Pact...\n\n\nGlobalism is more of a political buzzword (at least as it's been used over the last decade or so). Generally, a globalist is a person/group/institution that supports globalization. The reason that the alt-right is opposed to \"globalism\" is because \"globalist\" institutions ultimately lead to the centralisation of power (within said institution), and thus infringe upon the sovereignty of the nation states that are a party to the institution. \n\nUse Brexit as an example. One of the major issues in the run-up to the referendum was that of \"taking power back from Brussels.\" To many people, the centralised nature of EU lawmaking (particularly economic regulaions) took power away from the average UK voter.*\n\n\n\n*It's worth noting that, if the UK decides to completely leave the EU free trade zone, it will have to default back to WTO trade regulations which are far more aggressively centralised.\n\n"], [50, "The first half of this has two generally good layman definitions before it gets into the opinionated section of the post:\n\nhttp://www.dodgewinston.com/blog/?p=699\n\nGenerally, it's a sentiment or attitude towards what sort of policies you want enacted politically when deciding to put the priority of the national community or the global community first.\n\nEasiest example in current events would be the Trans Pacific Partnership in the United States. People who support TPP from either side of the aisle (Obama, Clinton, Rubio and Cruz at one point) would be supporting a *globalist* policy perceptively aiming to benefit the global community. People who opposed TPP (Sanders, Trump) would be opposing it from a *nationalist* perspective as it would come at a perceived detriment state side.\n\nThe Alt-Right as it is consists of many philosophical points and policy desires that reject the globalist framework and supports ethnostates/ethnonationalism from what I can gather, so they would be considered as very anti-globalist."], [303, "Globalization and Globalism are two different concepts. While the Alt-Right considers them both to be bad, Globalism is much worse and they hate the two for different reasons:\n\n* Globalization: the process of integration and cooperation between nation states in trade and business, as well as culture etc. \n\nThis is somewhat bad (although some on the alt right view it much less negatively than others, or even as a positive) because of it's negative impact on the economy and on the demographics of a nation. Trump is somewhat opposed to Globalization because American jobs are being outsourced elsewhere. \n\n* Globalism:\n\nIn essence, it's the desire to replace the nation state as the main authority figure. Globalists support international organizations like the EU. Globalists want groups like the EU or the UN to have more authority over individual citizens than their nation states. \n\nThe alt-right opposes globalism because it takes away power from citizens:\n\nYour vote in a country of 65 million (like the UK) is much more powerful than it is in a population of roughly 700 million (population of Europe, and yes I know that the EU is not the entirety of Europe but I'm doing this as an example) which, like the EU, might not even give you a voice in different matters. \n\nThis is the way I see it anyway. Different people within the Alt-Right have their reasons. \n\nEdit: Sorry for my clumsy response. I'm on mobile and very tired.

Jamaica can grow sugarcane but maybe needs some additional timber. These two trade sugar for timber. Makes sense. In 2016, if you are going to trade with countries, you need trade agreements. "], [39, "Beginning with the election of President Obama in 2008, a new divide in American and World Politics has emerged, and consumed both Democrat and Republican parties in 2016. This is the divide between multicultural globalists, on the center-left (which is represented by the establishment members, eg Obama, Clinton, Reid, Pelosi, of the Democrat Party); and populist nationalism, on the right (which is represented by the alt-Right members of the Republican Party, eg President-elect Trump, Bannon, Guiliani).\n\nMichael Lind [1] describes this divide very well in a article in *Politico Magazine*: \n\n>For the nationalists, the most important dividing line is that between American citizens and everyone else\u2014symbolized by Trump\u2019s proposal for a Mexican border wall. On the right, American nationalism is tainted by strains of white racial and religious nationalism and nativism, reinforced by Trump\u2019s incendiary language about Mexicans and his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S.\n\n>But while there is overlap between nationalists and racists, the two are not the same thing. The most extreme white nationalists don\u2019t advocate nationalism as a governing philosophy in our multiracial country; they hope to withdraw from American life and create a white homeland within the nation-state. Nationalism is different than white nationalism, and a populist American nationalism untainted by vestiges of racial bigotry might have transracial appeal, like versions of national populism in Latin America.\n\n>The rise of populist nationalism on the right is paralleled by the rise of multicultural globalism on the center-left.\n\n>For multicultural globalists, national boundaries are increasingly obsolete and perhaps even immoral. According to the emerging progressive orthodoxy, the identities that count are subnational (race, gender, orientation) and supranational (citizenship of the world). While not necessarily representative of Democratic voters, progressive pundits and journalists increasingly speak a dialect of ethical cosmopolitanism or globalism \u2014 the idea that it is unjust to discriminate in favor of one\u2019s fellow nationals against citizens of foreign countries.\n\n>This difference in worldviews maps neatly into differences in policy. Nationalists support immigration and trade deals only if they improve the living standards of citizens of the nation. For the new, globally minded progressives, the mere well-being of American workers is not a good enough reason to oppose immigration or trade liberalization. It\u2019s an argument that today\u2019s progressive globalists have borrowed from libertarians: immigration or trade that depresses the wages of Americans is still justified if it makes immigrants or foreign workers better off.\n\n>The disagreements within both parties on trade is a living example of the inchoate policy realignment. Every major Republican presidential candidate supported free-trade agreements \u2014 with the sole and major exception of Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, who routinely slams free-trade deals and has called for the reintroduction of certain tariffs on foreign goods.\n\n>Likewise, the current opposition of many Democratic politicians to free-trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership reflects the residual influence of declining manufacturing unions within the party According to a March 2016 study by the Pew Research Center, by a margin of 56 percent to 38 percent, Democratic voters believe that free-trade agreements have been good for the U.S. Among Republicans, those numbers are almost reversed: by a 53 percent to 38 percent margin, a majority of Republicans believe free-trade has been a bad thing. Among younger Americans, who tend to prefer Democrats to Republicans, support for free trade is high: 67 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds say trade agreements are good for the country. Even progressives who campaign against trade deals feel obliged by the logic of ethical cosmopolitanism to justify their opposition in the name of the labor rights of foreign workers or the good of the global environment.\n\n>For the next decade or longer, as the parties\u2019 stances adjust, this \u201cborder war\u201d that has succeeded the \u201cculture war\u201d will define and remake American politics.\n\n1. http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-election-realignment-partisan-political-party-policy-democrats-republicans-politics-213909"], [16, "I think that it has a nebulous meaning that changes for different groups.

"]], [[{"comment": "Globalization is an academic term used (mostly) in social sciences, particularly International Relations. True globalization probably started in the 18th-19th centuries and refers to the spread of integrative political/economic/social/cultural exchange. Colonialism/ the age of exploration were the prime movers in the rise of globalization, and the later introduction of advanced communication technologies accelerated globalization considerably.\n\nIn the 21st century we see can see multiple examples of globalization:\n\nPolitical economy: The Bretton Woods system (IMF,GATT,  WTO etc...), OPEC, G10...\n\nForeign political relations: the U.N, the EU...\n\nMilitary: NATO, Warsaw Pact...\n\n\nGlobalism is more of a political buzzword (at least as it's been used over the last decade or so). Generally, a globalist is a person/group/institution that supports globalization. The reason that the alt-right is opposed to \"globalism\" is because \"globalist\" institutions ultimately lead to the centralisation of power (within said institution), and thus infringe upon the sovereignty of the nation states that are a party to the institution. \n\nUse Brexit as an example. One of the major issues in the run-up to the referendum was that of \"taking power back from Brussels.\" To many people, the centralised nature of EU lawmaking (particularly economic regulaions) took power away from the average UK voter.*\n\n\n\n*It's worth noting that, if the UK decides to completely leave the EU free trade zone, it will have to default back to WTO trade regulations which are far more aggressively centralised.\n\n", "id": "daia7om"}, {"comment": "The thing that concerns me most about the swing away from a more economically connected world is the fact that trade brings countries closer together; it helps reduce the likelihood of conflicts (generally). \n\nWe've lived in one of the craziest times of global peace for the second half of the 20th century, despite the Cold War and it's various proxy wars. People have forgotten the factors that led to WWII, and some of the rationale behind globalisation. I'm not saying it's perfect - far from it. I worked in development & witnessed first-hand the race to the bottom as countries undercut one another to win business from wealthy developed economies & multinational corporations. I've also seen the job losses to a lesser extent here in Australia, where the GFC was mostly avoided due to the mining boom & Chinese demand. But I don't think the downsides of globalisation are a reason to close borders, increase tariffs, and put up barriers to try and recreate an imagined 'golden age'.\n\nFor me, the future cannot belong to corporations. It cannot be led by companies and money-hungry executives. It must instead be led by movements of people who reject greed because of the damage it's done to the planet and the world's poorest. It must be a world of trade with smart regulation that resists profit as a driver, but puts people at its heart. And most importantly, the future must be protected from environmental exploitation, which has been fueled by the greed I mentioned earlier. In this world, we can still have global trade and people movement, but trade and migration will be supported well thought-out policies not driven by nationalistic dogma or idealocigal purity, but by a concern for our shared humanity and a safe, healthy world for us all. \n\n/rant.

And if you cut off the access to cheap labor, well, that just hastens the development of robotic labor. \n\nThe world use to employ upwards of 75% of the population towards agriculture to feed one/two billion people.

In the United States, it drops to [1.6%.](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS?locations=US) What killed agriculture labor is the same thing that killed automotive labor. Automation and mechanization. \n\nThomas L. Friedman wrote a book titled *The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization* in 1999. One of the first things he talks about in it is visiting a Lexus manufacturing plant in Japan. Japan, like the US, has high labor cost. So why was Lexus manufacturing cars there? Well, it's quite simple. Robots. He gave an example, a machine would apply caulking/adhesive to the window frame and the windshield would be placed on the frame. Then a completely different machine would use a knife and swirl around and cut the dripping caulking off of the first machine. Those machines are why Japan is able to manufacturer cars in Japan. American car companies do the same thing. \n\nDo you really think American automotive production is dead? Take a look at this data.

The problem isn't American automotive manufacturing is disappearing. It's the fact that American automotive manufacturing labor isn't needed anymore. \n\nThe sad thing about this election is that it reveals how delusional people are. The rust belt is never coming back. The millions of workers employed in the automotive industry in the 50s/60s/70s are simply not needed anymore.\n\nSo if labor as we know it is dying, then what can people sell? The answer is simple.

We can change building codes to regulate the efficiency of taps and toilets and every other plumbing apparatus, and as we're a State of increasingly dense cities, as more people move in and more projects get built, the benefits of that will scale up. Easy enough if we do that at the State level.\n\nWe could have separate water systems for lawn irrigation and drinking. We can measure how wells are being used, we can regulate swimming pools, but all of these are residential.\n\nThe real use is in agriculture. Industrialized agriculture. Even in drought years, we output more by value than Iowa or Texas, the next two biggest agriculture States. And a lot, a huge amount of that water, gets used by just a small number of crops. Of particular concern is alfalfa and almonds.\n\nTurns out, down in Imperial County, we grow *a lot* of alfalfa, and most of that gets directly exported to China. California is also *the* single largest exporter of almonds, being one of a very small number of places where you even can cultivate almond trees, and we supply 90% of the world's demand for almonds, and just these two crops alone in a highly diverse agriculture economy take up 25% of California's water supply.\n\nYou know what the obvious solution would be, if the legal framework allowed for this? Export controls. Our water rights laws are a problem, yes, California is entirely within its rights to address these, and we need to. The things we can't address though, are 1. the ways that Congress legislates interstate commerce, which could cripple any export-controlling legislation California feasibly could pass and 2. NAFTA, a treaty California is party to only because the United States is, which could see California, not the US, sued and penalized for trying to control its exports of almonds and alfalfa, and 3. WTO, another international body that could sanction the US and/or California.\n\nSo even if we addressed our mess of water laws into something that made sense, there's a nearly insurmountable national and international framework in place that could screw us over after.\n\nAnd not just us, Peru has seen a rise in quiona prices, a dietary staple for them and part of their national cuisine, largely because western nations have a love affair with it. In Central America, nations like Guatemala and Honduras are heavily dependent on agriculture exports, are even encouraged to specialize in them, and are the historic poster children of \"Banana republics\".\n\nSo circling back around to California, and the United States, I want to see each and every State strong, and able to take care of their own needs in a decentralized fashion, even if the Federal government is incapable or incompetent or otherwise disabled in a crisis situation, with diversified economies that can stand up to large shocks. I don't see that now, nor do I see that as a possibility with the present economic world order. Moreover, long shipping distances increases the amount of energy required to provide goods to market, and that is untenable with global warming.\n\nMaybe there is a best of both worlds form of globalization out there, I do believe in the necessity of an international structure that maintains the peace but as we move into a more multipolar world, I'm not convinced that the same structures that have prevented a WW3 thus far will be capable of preventing a WW3 this next century.", "id": "daitpy2"}, {"comment": "The issue is, corporations are global and can move where they please, but labour cannot freely move about to find new jobs.

Great! \n\nIt seems that when production dissapears it takes the middle class with it, and the areas it leaves don't stay wealthy and would seemingly be on their way to regress to their preindustrial-revolution state. Except that because of the other factor of increased production and automation, there is nowhere for them to go. \n\nThose countries have to first figure out what to do with their millions of displaced workers and their offspring from the baby booms that occur with prospertiy. Not so great. Really no so great.  And going to get worse. \n\nThis is a fact of the export of production and the things it takes with it. And when it is pointed out to Globalists, they do not respond with the greatest, if any, of answers. \n\nEither no one saw that side effect coming  or they did and now they just don't care.

This is the divide between multicultural globalists, on the center-left (which is represented by the establishment members, eg Obama, Clinton, Reid, Pelosi, of the Democrat Party); and populist nationalism, on the right (which is represented by the alt-Right members of the Republican Party, eg President-elect Trump, Bannon, Guiliani).\n\nMichael Lind [1] describes this divide very well in a article in *Politico Magazine*: \n\n>For the nationalists, the most important dividing line is that between American citizens and everyone else\u2014symbolized by Trump\u2019s proposal for a Mexican border wall. On the right, American nationalism is tainted by strains of white racial and religious nationalism and nativism, reinforced by Trump\u2019s incendiary language about Mexicans and his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S.\n\n>But while there is overlap between nationalists and racists, the two are not the same thing. The most extreme white nationalists don\u2019t advocate nationalism as a governing philosophy in our multiracial country; they hope to withdraw from American life and create a white homeland within the nation-state. Nationalism is different than white nationalism, and a populist American nationalism untainted by vestiges of racial bigotry might have transracial appeal, like versions of national populism in Latin America.\n\n>The rise of populist nationalism on the right is paralleled by the rise of multicultural globalism on the center-left.\n\n>For multicultural globalists, national boundaries are increasingly obsolete and perhaps even immoral. According to the emerging progressive orthodoxy, the identities that count are subnational (race, gender, orientation) and supranational (citizenship of the world). While not necessarily representative of Democratic voters, progressive pundits and journalists increasingly speak a dialect of ethical cosmopolitanism or globalism \u2014 the idea that it is unjust to discriminate in favor of one\u2019s fellow nationals against citizens of foreign countries.\n\n>This difference in worldviews maps neatly into differences in policy. Nationalists support immigration and trade deals only if they improve the living standards of citizens of the nation. For the new, globally minded progressives, the mere well-being of American workers is not a good enough reason to oppose immigration or trade liberalization. It\u2019s an argument that today\u2019s progressive globalists have borrowed from libertarians: immigration or trade that depresses the wages of Americans is still justified if it makes immigrants or foreign workers better off.\n\n>The disagreements within both parties on trade is a living example of the inchoate policy realignment. Every major Republican presidential candidate supported free-trade agreements \u2014 with the sole and major exception of Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee, who routinely slams free-trade deals and has called for the reintroduction of certain tariffs on foreign goods.\n\n>Likewise, the current opposition of many Democratic politicians to free-trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership reflects the residual influence of declining manufacturing unions within the party According to a March 2016 study by the Pew Research Center, by a margin of 56 percent to 38 percent, Democratic voters believe that free-trade agreements have been good for the U.S. Among Republicans, those numbers are almost reversed: by a 53 percent to 38 percent margin, a majority of Republicans believe free-trade has been a bad thing. Among younger Americans, who tend to prefer Democrats to Republicans, support for free trade is high: 67 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds say trade agreements are good for the country. Even progressives who campaign against trade deals feel obliged by the logic of ethical cosmopolitanism to justify their opposition in the name of the labor rights of foreign workers or the good of the global environment.\n\n>For the next decade or longer, as the parties\u2019 stances adjust, this \u201cborder war\u201d that has succeeded the \u201cculture war\u201d will define and remake American politics.\n\n1. http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/05/2016-election-realignment-partisan-political-party-policy-democrats-republicans-politics-213909", "id": "daiav5w"}, {"comment": "That's an excellent article.

Today, billions of foreigners are roughly as wealthy as they are. And worse - some of those foreigners are immigrating, and competing with them on equal terms.\n\nIt's the desire to re-acquire that lost sense of self-worth that drives both hatred of \"globalism\" on the far right, and \"neo-liberalism\" (as they call it) on the far left.

The rebuttal typically consists of something like, \"but [company] used to make [thing] here.\", failing to realize that once the company offshored production, their profits skyrocketed -- if you think a company is willing to let their profits decrease in order to give you, oh patriotic citizen, a job, you clearly do not understand the premise of corporations within a capitalistic society. \n\nThat said, moving toward more isolationist policies is nothing more than a recipe for greater income inequality due to even further diminishing wages and the significant increase in the prices of domestically made goods.

This demo was generally scary as fuck, creative, and had a unique feel.  It quickly went viral.\n\nNow, this demo was meant to be very confusing.  It was designed to be a puzzle that people would fiddle with and try to reach the end of over the course of about a month.   And in a sense, it was successful.  Everyone was talking about it, and on their own, people would never have reached the end.\n\nBut the developers underestimated the internet, and it was quickly solved and just as quickly spoiled.  It turned out that PT was a Teaser for an upcoming Silent Hill game.  \n\nA  Silent Hill game created by Hideo Kojima and Guillermo Del Toro, and starring Norman Fucking Reedus.\n\nNow, you have to understand that Silent Hill as a franchise had been going downhill since 3.  It was *floundering* due to Konami's poor treatment of it.  And not only that, survival horror as a genre had been pretty barren as well, only seeing a revival in the form of things like Amnesia and Outlast.  \n\nSo for Silent Hills to be headed by this absolute dream team?  And for the work they've done so far to not only be good, but to show that they actually understand what makes Silent Hill so scary?\n\nFor the first time in a long time, everyone had wet pants over Silent Hill.\n\nAnd then...Konami fired Kojima.  MGSV made it out the door bruised, but beautiful.\n\nSilent Hills was not so lucky.  Silent Hills was aborted, PT was removed from the store, and made unplayable for those that had downloaded it.\n\nTL;DR - Konami took a former icon of Survival Horror that had been so mishandled for so long that people had all but given up on it, and they gave it to Kojima and Guillermo Del Toro, who brought the series back from the brink.  For the first time in ages, everyone was excited for Silent Hill.\n\nAnd then Konami unceremoniously killed it and attempted to erase it from history, killing everyone's hopes.\n\nThe silver lining is that PT was so successful that it singlehandedly convinced Capcom that turning Resident Evil into an action game just because RE4 was well-received was a poor decision and now Resident Evil 7 is going to be a proper freaking survival horror game that seems to be inspired by PT's gameplay.\n"], [6, "[removed]"], [4, "Responses here explain it, but also add that they ruin every game series they make by eithr cancelling it or turning it into pachinko."], [1, "Fired Kojima, cut the development of MGSV short (this is obvious while playing it), canceled Silent Hills/P.T., sitting on classic IPs that they will do nothing with but make pachinko machines... etc. \n\nKonami doesn't care though, video games were only a small part of their business.

This demo was generally scary as fuck, creative, and had a unique feel.  It quickly went viral.\n\nNow, this demo was meant to be very confusing.  It was designed to be a puzzle that people would fiddle with and try to reach the end of over the course of about a month.   And in a sense, it was successful.  Everyone was talking about it, and on their own, people would never have reached the end.\n\nBut the developers underestimated the internet, and it was quickly solved and just as quickly spoiled.

For the first time in ages, everyone was excited for Silent Hill.\n\nAnd then Konami unceremoniously killed it and attempted to erase it from history, killing everyone's hopes.\n\nThe silver lining is that PT was so successful that it singlehandedly convinced Capcom that turning Resident Evil into an action game just because RE4 was well-received was a poor decision and now Resident Evil 7 is going to be a proper freaking survival horror game that seems to be inspired by PT's gameplay.\n", "id": "daqdmuw"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "daq788x"}], [{"comment": "Responses here explain it, but also add that they ruin every game series they make by eithr cancelling it or turning it into pachinko.", "id": "dapqgxd"}], [{"comment": "Fired Kojima, cut the development of MGSV short (this is obvious while playing it), canceled Silent Hills/P.T., sitting on classic IPs that they will do nothing with but make pachinko machines... etc. \n\nKonami doesn't care though, video games were only a small part of their business.

The Venezuelan government however, officially, has set the currency at fixed rate of .10 cents for every US dollar. It is therefor *officially* a fixed exchange rate arbitrarily determined by the government. There's many many problems with this however, it would be somewhat like if the US government decided to pass a law saying you could only sell and buy an iPhone for 10 dollars. The value of an iPhone is obviously much greater than that... so, the vast majority of Venezuelans have to rely on using the black market to get US dollars. This website referenced, posts exchange rates for the Venezuelan Bolivar at the Colombian/Ven border. It's used by most Venezuelans on a day-to-day basis because the government officially prohibits the currency to \"float\" to whatever the average prices people are actually willing to pay for it. The currency value doesn't literally depend on this guy running the website, as much as his website is the most practically accurate resource currently available to determine what value people are actually willing to trade bolivars for US dollars.

What is actually going on... \nMost currencies, like the US dollar, Euro, GBP etc... have a [floating exchange rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_exchange_rate). Which means, you are *officially* allowed to trade it for any amount of another currency someone else is willing to trade for it. Similar to how you would sell something you posted on ebay to the highest bidder you could get. \"Officially\" meaning, the country condones it / it's legal within that country. The Venezuelan government however, officially, has set the currency at fixed rate of .10 cents for every US dollar. It is therefor *officially* a fixed exchange rate arbitrarily determined by the government. There's many many problems with this however, it would be somewhat like if the US government decided to pass a law saying you could only sell and buy an iPhone for 10 dollars. The value of an iPhone is obviously much greater than that... so, the vast majority of Venezuelans have to rely on using the black market to get US dollars. This website referenced, posts exchange rates for the Venezuelan Bolivar at the Colombian/Ven border. It's used by most Venezuelans on a day-to-day basis because the government officially prohibits the currency to \"float\" to whatever the average prices people are actually willing to pay for it. The currency value doesn't literally depend on this guy running the website, as much as his website is the most practically accurate resource currently available to determine what value people are actually willing to trade bolivars for US dollars. It's closer to a news site, and influences the value of the Bolivar to USD in a similar way that the Wallstreet Journal affects stock prices... but, probably to a tremendously greater degree.

You ever see those cake decorating shows on Food Network? Ones like Ace of Cakes or Cake Boss where they make these huge cakes that look like a car or a landscape or something? Well in order to get a cake to look like that, you have to use a lot of Fondant and Gum Paste. Cake in and of itself only really works in layers, to get those various shapes you stack layers of cake and cover it with Fondant to hold its shape and then you can add more decoration on top.\n\nWell when those shows got popular, everyone wanted cakes like that. The problem is, making a cake like that is hard and expensive. My sister can spend hours decorating even a simple cake. So a lot of bakers trying to copy that style and cash in on the fad make a lot of cakes covered in Fondant. However if they are not that good, in order to make the cake look better the layer of Fondant is thick, to make up for their lack of skill, cause it's easier to shape Fondant than stack layers in an intricate patern. So now when people get cake they get this thick layer of tasteless, doughy, marginally edible modeling clay.

They announced the necromancer for $5 and the \"Diablo I hd remake\" is actually a dungeon in d3 that is only open part of the year.   \n   \nD3's problem stem from the game requiring you to get your 6 piece armor set every season. You can't be competitive without a six set bonus because the bonuses are so strong. This leads to each class having viable build equal in number to the armor sets available to them. Which leads to stagnation because everyone is running the same thing. Additionally there is no trading, no real endgame content outside of grinding more gear. D3 gives you all these cool things to make you stronger with nothing to use them against.   \n   \nThe only current end game is greater rifts, which are just taking the same monsters you have been fighting against all game and making them stronger. Nothing new about them.   \n   \nThis leads to more people leaving as you realize each season of Diablo is \"gear up and stop playing.\" Doubly so since until you get to the very highest rifts most stuff can be soloed, and you can never trade. Ultimately this makes d3 a glorified single player game with always on DRM. I held out for awhile, but d3 has tried to shift directions too many times since launch for anything coherent to have come out of it.    \n   \nThen you look at d2 and it had everything: trading, non-soloable (easily at least) content, incentives to play with others, better PvP, and chat rooms, build variety without reliance on overpowered sets.", "id": "dahodxf"}], [{"comment": "**Diablo 3** isn't seen as being better than **Diablo 2** in some people's views.
