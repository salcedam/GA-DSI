It was probably a very high-contrast shot, with the white of his shirt washing out the detail of the rest of the image. \n\nThe photographer would have physically blocked light from reaching the photo paper around the shirt, so the suit did not come out black and overexposed, while allowing the white of the shirt to expose longer, and thus darken, creating an image with softer contrast between the shirt and jacket. \n\nThis process is rather imprecise by definition, and so the shirt appears unnatural compared to what the naked eye would expect to see. ", "id": "daqqi0m"}, {"comment": "Looking at it again and not wanting to edit my above post again, it seems to me the photographer made a cutout in the exact shape of the white of the jacket, and held it above the photo paper to block light from exposing the jacket. They would have kind of moved this cutout up and down over the image as it was exposed into the paper, to reduce the stark white outline you see on the shirt. This would have made the cutouts shadow bigger or smaller, allowing a little light to hit every now and again, softening the hard contrasting edge. \n\nIf this were done in a photography class or photojournalist room today, the instructor or editor might likely ask for a better print, but back in 1917, this was probably the best the photographer could reasonably do.

The victorious allied powers rather than admit that they fucked up in the first place divvied up the spoils outside of Europe, charged the cost of the war to Germany (the only major Central power left), and balkanized Eastern Europe trying to cobble together buffer states to guard against Germany and Communist Russia.", "id": "dal541r"}, {"comment": "Even in their original form the reparations were well within German ability to pay, despite their disastrous wartime economic policies.

They were the ones who encouraged Austria to maintain their extreme, unreasonable demands on Serbia. They were the ones who attacked Russia, France and neutral Belgium.\n\nThen, in the actual conduct of the war, Germans gave excellent basis for later claims for reparations. Atrocities against Belgian and French civilians were plentiful, for one, but it's worth noting that much of the fighting took place in French industrial heartland. As a result of wartime destruction and straight up theft of machinery and resources by the German forces the French economy was in a much worse position to recover after WW1 than the German one. It's also worth noting that Germans were extremely harsh when making peace with Russia and were planning to be nowhere near as lenient with the Allied powers as they were lenient in their turn - with most plans including wholesale annexation of Belgium and chunks of French territory.\n\nSo there's your landscape. Millions dead, including substantial numbers of civilians murdered by German troops in Belgium and France. French industrial heartland and much of Belgium devastated. Polish independence movement, long considering Paris its home in exile, using this chance to convince the Allied powers to help it escape the heavy hand of German occupation. All the while there were genuine concerns that Germany would try its luck at war again as soon as it was able to.\n\nIn light of all that, the position adopted by the victors was on the *milder* side of what was proposed, with some ideas including permanently balkanizing the German heartland. \n\nThat \"This is not peace, this is armistice for 20 years\" quote? That wasn't Foch commenting on the treaty's unfairness towards the Germans - he thought it wasn't *harsh* enough, and that it would allow Germany to recover and become a threat fairly rapidly.

Some jerk kid is playing in the street, and accidentally smashes a bakers window. Everyone tells him what a jerk he is. But some smug econ 101 student says \"No, this is actually a good thing!\"\n\n\"Now the baker will buy a new window pane from the glazier. And the glazier will buy new boots from the cobbler. And the cobbler will buy a night with Betty in the saloon. And Betty will buy a new dress from the tailor. This good for the economy, we should keep breaking stuff until we're all rich!\"\n\nThe fallacy is that breaking things will result in wealth being created. It's true that the velocity of money through the town is good and represents tools and resources being used to create wealth. But if the baker hadn't had his window smashed, he could have bought himself new boots from the cobbler, and the chain of economic transactions occurred from there. The town is one window richer in the second scenario than the first. In the same way an economic stimulus plan that pays people to dig holes just to fill them back up is a waste of resources. War is also overwhelmingly just destruction and people marching in circles accomplishing nothing productive, and the world contains no more wealth after their efforts than before.\n\n\nOne problem to look out for though though is that an econ 102 student with far right leaning bias will call all government spending a broken window. \"If the government offers a stimulus package to build bridges and fix roads and put people through education, then that money came from taxpayers who aren't spending their money on what they wanted. And that is inherently less useful than if you let people buy what they want. Because if you let them buy what they want they will spend their money on whatever has the most value to them, and that's maximum wealth creation.\". This isn't a good example of the broken window fallacy because the money raised through taxes comes overwhelmingly from rich people (or ought to), and they were just sitting on it in investment portfolios. There is plenty of Capital already in investment portfolios, dumping more money on top won't increase demand for goods. So taxing from the rich and spending it on valuable things like roads and bridges is a good use of money. Destruction is a shitty use.\n\nYou can also imagine how this applies to marketing. Nothing is being accomplished except enticing customers away from your competitors. Who then spend money on their own marketing in order to entice those customers back to them.

It had the weight of 3,000 kilos and came in crates/boxes. One of the people in this picture is Christian Mathiessen, the founder of Norway\u2019s biggest fruit importer, Bama. Norway was the second country to import bananas in Europe, after the United Kingdom. It\u2019s very interesting that before global trading became as it is today, people really didn\u2019t encounter many products that weren\u2019t made locally. Seeing an item made in China must have seemed exotic to someone living in Mexico during 1832.\n\nPortuguese sailors brought bananas to Europe from West Africa in the early fifteenth century. Its Guinean name banema, which became banana in English, was first found in print in the seventeenth century. The original banana has been cultivated and used since ancient times, even pre-dating the cultivation of rice. While the banana thrived in Africa, its origins are said to be of East Asia and Oceania. The banana was carried by sailors to the Canary Islands and the West Indies, finally making it to North America with Spanish missionary Friar Tomas de Berlanga.\n\n>Although bananas may only look like a fruit, they represent a wide variety of environmental, economic, social, and political problems. The banana trade symbolizes economic imperialism, injustices in the global trade market, and the globalization of the agricultural economy. Bananas are also number four on the list of staple crops in the world and one of the biggest profit makers in supermarkets, making them critical for economic and global food security. As one of the first tropical fruits to be exported, bananas were a cheap way to bring \u201cthe tropics\u201d to North America and Europe. Bananas have become such a common, inexpensive grocery item that we often forget where they come from and how they got here.\n\n*-Rebecca Cohen, Global Issues for Breakfast: The Banana Industry and its Problems, The Science Creative Quarterly, Issue 3, 2008*\n\nThe bananas in the photo are Gros Michel bananas. Gros Michel, often known as Big Mike, is an export cultivar of banana and was, until the 1950s, the main variety exported to the United States. His variety was once the dominant export banana to Europe and North America, grown in South America and Africa. In the 1950s the Panama disease, a wilt caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, wiped out vast tracts of Gros Michel plantations in South America and Africa, but the cultivar survived in Thailand. The original Gros Michel is said to have a unique fragrance. The Panama disease inflicted enormous costs and forced producers to switch to other, disease-resistant cultivars. However, new strains of Panama disease threaten the production of today\u2019s most popular cultivar, Cavendish.\n\n[Source.](http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/bananas-norway-1905/)"]], [[{"comment": "This is one of the first batches of banana that was sent to Norway.

Seeing an item made in China must have seemed exotic to someone living in Mexico during 1832.\n\nPortuguese sailors brought bananas to Europe from West Africa in the early fifteenth century. Its Guinean name banema, which became banana in English, was first found in print in the seventeenth century. The original banana has been cultivated and used since ancient times, even pre-dating the cultivation of rice. While the banana thrived in Africa, its origins are said to be of East Asia and Oceania. The banana was carried by sailors to the Canary Islands and the West Indies, finally making it to North America with Spanish missionary Friar Tomas de Berlanga.\n\n>Although bananas may only look like a fruit, they represent a wide variety of environmental, economic, social, and political problems. The banana trade symbolizes economic imperialism, injustices in the global trade market, and the globalization of the agricultural economy. Bananas are also number four on the list of staple crops in the world and one of the biggest profit makers in supermarkets, making them critical for economic and global food security. As one of the first tropical fruits to be exported, bananas were a cheap way to bring \u201cthe tropics\u201d to North America and Europe. Bananas have become such a common, inexpensive grocery item that we often forget where they come from and how they got here.\n\n*-Rebecca Cohen, Global Issues for Breakfast: The Banana Industry and its Problems, The Science Creative Quarterly, Issue 3, 2008*\n\nThe bananas in the photo are Gros Michel bananas. Gros Michel, often known as Big Mike, is an export cultivar of banana and was, until the 1950s, the main variety exported to the United States. His variety was once the dominant export banana to Europe and North America, grown in South America and Africa. In the 1950s the Panama disease, a wilt caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, wiped out vast tracts of Gros Michel plantations in South America and Africa, but the cultivar survived in Thailand. The original Gros Michel is said to have a unique fragrance. The Panama disease inflicted enormous costs and forced producers to switch to other, disease-resistant cultivars. However, new strains of Panama disease threaten the production of today\u2019s most popular cultivar, Cavendish.\n\n[Source.](http://rarehistoricalphotos.com/bananas-norway-1905/)", "id": "damfcd4"}]]], "5g95ip": ["A fireman carries a young boy out of rubble after a bombing raid [1941][615 x 410]", "2016-12-03 14:21:02", 256, "http://imgur.com/DZXY8Nu", [[3, "Which country?

You have the Armenians not just wanting acknowledgement but they also want Mount Ararat, money, more land, public shaming and so on.

While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview that addresses common questions, and included a short list of introductory reading. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps\nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?\nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

I tend to view the current estimates as true, but i still think the current climate of the \"debate\" on the holocaust is filled with too much tension. Like the Rape of Nanking has estimate ranging from 20 to upwards of 40 million killed by some chinese scholars. Is there an actual answer to why the Holocaust is such a Taboo subject to debate, while Japanese atrocities aren't? Besides the racist \"because the Jews\" one."]], [[{"comment": "Hi!  \nAs we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview that addresses common questions, and included a short list of introductory reading. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to ~11 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise!\nUnfortunately, there is a small, but at times vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?\nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942.

A serious problem that modern spectators have when looking back at the history of Nazism is that they see the propaganda pictures and footage and assume that the German people were wild supporters of Hitler and Nazism; propaganda was meant to convince the world AND Germany that Hitler had major support, so don't resist him or question his hold on the country.  It certainly fooled the Allies during the war into assuming that Germans were willing robots goosestepping to Hitler's tune, when things were actually a lot more complex.  There was a ton of resistance to the Nazis, but their power via state means of control meant that Germans could not organize resistance without being quickly infiltrated by the Gestapo and if they did even passively resist they'd end up in concentration camps.  For instance during the Nazis period over 3.5 million non-Jewish Germans were sent to prison or concentration camps for anti-regime activities, while over 77,000 were executed for the same:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps\n>Between 1933 and the fall of Nazi Germany in 1945, more than 3.5 million Germans were forced to spend time in concentration camps and prisons for political reasons,[15][16][17] and approximately 77,000 Germans were executed for one or another form of resistance by Special Courts, courts-martial, and the civil justice system. Many of these Germans had served in government, the military, or in civil positions, which enabled them to engage in subversion and conspiracy against the Nazis.[8]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_resistance_to_Nazism\n>Approximately 77,000 German citizens were killed for one or another form of resistance by Special Courts, courts-martial, People's Court and the civil justice system.

Not that hard when you have several million youth required to spend time in the Hitler Youth organization.  The Nazi party membership rolls at their peak were about 8 million, 10% of the maximum German population by 1939, so 700k is less than 10% of party membership, assuming that everyone there was party members.  With enough planning you can make stuff happen.\n\nAlso the Nazis claimed there were 700k people there, there is no independent group to counter their claims, so we have no way of verifying that is true.  I mean people claim all sorts of crazy numbers of people that come to the National Mall in Washington D.C. that park services doesn't even try to cross check.  \n\nEdit: in case I didn't make it clear below there were absolutely a hardcore of racists and anti-semites that were at the heart of the Nazi organization and were driving the genocide agenda.  Within the Nazis' core supporters were of course then a sliding scale of bigots/racists/anti-semites.  Some people went along because they liked everything else the Nazis did, some were severely racist, but weren't cool with mass murder.  Some just loved power and were willing to do ANYTHING to get it, up to and including organizing genocide (Reinhard Heydrich).  Nazi supporters ran a huge gamut of beliefs, views, and things they would tolerate, but were led by the craziest/most sociopathic people imaginable.  I think most had no idea what they were actually supporting and thought Hitler would moderate or keep his policies within a tolerable, conventional spectrum and were legitimately caught off guard.  Clearly the high conservative Junker Prussians that put him in power thought he could be controlled, but ended up finding themselves purged and replaced.  \n\nNazi supporters in the 1930s were the right wing parts of society and were about 1/3rd of voters, pretty similar to what currently makes up the base of the American right wing proportionately or even in the 1940s the 1/3rd of society that was anti-FDR.  The Nazis at the peak of their electoral success only got about 34% of the vote.  Effectively most people that voted for the Nazis did so on their economic left economic plans, but radical right wing social agenda, specially the promise of law and order and to stop the Communists and German left (the German communists had tried to turn Germany into a Soviet states in 1918-19 with a violent revolution, while were involved in violent street fighting with the German right wing in the 1920s-30s and were taking orders from Stalin after he took over the USSR, so were heavily involved with a foreign government to take over Germany for their ideology of international communism).  The right wing Germans were deathly afraid of communism because they were generally middle class religious people that were upset about the disorder in Germany, the threat of communism (not an irrational fear actually given recent German history), the embarrassment of Germany by France in the 1920s, and fear of the future and Hitler promised to solve all of that.  He actually sort of did, which most politicians had been unable to do until that point.  He did jobs programs (that bankrupted the country), tore up the Treaty of Versailles, rearmed, reoccupied the Rheinland, restored order after all the political violence in Germany in the early 1930s partly by purging the Nazi party of the Brownshirts who were pretty violent thugs in the Night of Long Knives, while expropriating Jewish property and businesses to turn over to party supporters (which really boosted his popularity among his base), bribed government and military officials to cooperate with him (which earned him a lot of loyalty he wouldn't have otherwise gotten from traditional conservatives in government), and restored the faith of the average German in the system, even if it was a flawed one.  \n\nCertainly the Nazis did their own parallel help system before they got in power by helping out supporters or swing voters with food and such, while promising if they got in power they would make the government actually provide jobs for people; for traditional German males of the 1930s work was an identity issue and taking handouts was supremely embarrassing, especially if they were willing and able to work, but hadn't found work.  Jobs programs like building the Autobahn and rearmament spending, as well as laws to outlaw the employment of teenagers and single women until all married men had found jobs really resulted in massive good will for Hitler personally (not necessarily the party), because he actually kept his campaign promises.  A lot of that stuff was tricks, like outlawing single women from getting jobs before married men or deficit spending the country into bankruptcy so that war was soon the only option before the economy ground to a halt.  But while it seemed to work Hitler got a lot of respect from his supporters and even non-supporters who appreciated being able to find work again and support their families, even if the wages were low.  \n\nThere was certainly more to it than just this, most stuff like political ideology is complicated and doesn't neatly fit into easy narratives; even people that loathed Hitler still respected his muscular foreign policy and success throughout the 1930s and were willing to overlook issues like the oppression of Jews and other minorities because it was easier to get along without running afoul of the Gestapo.

Used to protect large bases as well as small fire support bases (FSB's), to escort convoys and generally back up infantry operations. \n\nI once witnessed 11th ACR tanks and APC's stop an NVA ground attack in it's tracks. We knew they were coming, had up to the minute, eye's on, Intel of them deploying for the attack in the scrub jungle right off our small base.

We were there in the hastily built base specifically for the purpose of intercepting them in order to prevent them from attacking a larger US base nearby.\n\nThey got off a few rounds of small arms fire before the tanks and APC's opened up and quite literally mowed the brush backwards, it was like watching a field of hay being mown by an invisible mower.

By this time in the war their supplies were low, supplies that they did have were of a low quality, and men were being more and more drawn from demographics that would not usually be seen as adequate fighters, such as teenagers or the elderly. This meant that for a decisive initial strike in their offensive, German high command saw the need to pull the most highly motivated, largest, and most veteran troops. They would then shove these men, along with the highest quality weapons they had left (often pulled from lower grade troops) and shove them into these \"sturmtruppen\" or \"Stormtrooper\" units in hopes of quickly crushing the Entente lines. This move caused a lot of animosity from the other troops who were often losing their leaders and the few good weapons systems the Germans had left this late in the war. Despite this, moral before the offensive was still incredibly high amongst the Germans and many believed they were about to take part in the battle that would end the war in a sweeping German victory, like that dreamed of in 1914.

The whole discussion about who were first is a quite difficult topic, from lack of archeology evidence, ignorance, desire to claim the area from both sides and the Norwegian government to make the Sami people Norwegian. The later point in quite important as it was a really nasty thing done to the Sami as we tried really hard to eradicate the language, religion and culture.\n\nThe main reason why Sami is considered indigenous to the region is due to the we dont know aspect and because they held to traditional way of life while the germanic were far more infuenced by other germanic further south. Not to mention the Sami have fought long and hard to keep what they consider important cultur aspects from eradication by the hands of the more numerous Germanic (read Norwegian) culture. It's also really important to stress that even if Sami didnt come from the first human migration doesnt mean the germanic were here first, simply because we dont know. The first humans might have intermingled with Sami who migrated here, they might have become more germanic when/if the germanic migrated north much later. Or it might be a mix of both or none.\n\nSo to summerize, they are indigenous also to preserve this unique culture that is equal important to our identity in this region as the rest of us. Especially as Sami still faces difficulties today. It have been major discussion in the city of Troms\u00f8 on what name should be listed first on our city signs. The Norwegian name Troms\u00f8 or Sami name Romsa, one side want little to no Sami influence because they are an invasive culture, the other side wants Romsa to be equal to Troms\u00f8 because we have co-existed and intermingled for so long.\n\nHowever, the genocidal policy of \"fornorskning\" have made everything hard, culturally I have little to no connection with Sami, however tracing my lineage back reveal lots of Sami who had to supress the Sami culture.", "id": "daq5urk"}, {"comment": "You are conflating language/culture with genetics. Human migration to the region happened in several waves.\n\nThe first major wave was the initial hunter-gatherer one from both the East and South, about 9000 BC. This is what still makes up the majority of the genetic makeup. Then there was an agricultural revolution in Southern Scandinavia which happened in the late Neolithic, about 4000 BC. Note that all these people still spoke unknown languages.\n\nAround 2000 BC, Indo-European speakers arrived in southern Scandinavia, and replaced the local languages by unknown means. We can see in DNA haplogroups that the ones from Eastern Europe associated with Indo-European speakers make up a smaller percentage than the ones thought to originate with earlier hunter-gatherers, so a popular theory is that it was a small ruling elite imposing their language on the rest of the population. In any case, this eventually became the Germanic languages still spoken today.\n\nA while later, around 1500 BC, Uralic language speakers arrived from modern Russia, settling in southern Finland.

His job is always listed as \"young\" or \"boy,\" and one record says he's \"App. Eng.\" This might mean \"apprentice engineer,\" but I don't know. Maybe he was a chef onboard merchant ships.\n\nThe 1930 census says he lived in Quincy, Massachusetts with his wife, Josephine, and eight-year-old son, Joseph. It looks like he settled down permanently in the United States in 1921 and worked as a house painter.\n\nThe 1940 census says the family was living on Mott Street in New York (that's Little Italy, not far from where Weegee says this photo was taken). The census lists his occupation as \"chef,\" but it also says that he and his son were unemployed and looking for work. Sometime in 1940 Josephine got a job sewing underwear. I think Joseph Rivieccio served on merchant ships during the war after his father's death. He died in 1998 and is buried in a town on Long Island.\n\n~~I'm curious about who killed him, too.
