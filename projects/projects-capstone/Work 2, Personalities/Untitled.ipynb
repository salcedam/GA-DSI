One could say it is nice outside, whereas another person may think the weather is too hot or cold. Therefore, adjectives are the primary drivers of this flux. If we take colors, and nouns, then surely we all have equal, but not necessarily identical experiences, of what these things are. If we extend this notion to the physics of the world, we can surely say we have an equal understanding of what the world is. At the same time, though, we can not describe the elements of non-physical life because they are driven by non-physical means. \\n\\nRegarding quantum physics, the subatomic properties are definitely not in everyday life, and so we apply both physical and non-physical terms to try to make sense of it all.
