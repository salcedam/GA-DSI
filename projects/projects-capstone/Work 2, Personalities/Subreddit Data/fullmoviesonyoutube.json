Chewie and Han Solo are trying to get to the planet where Chewie's family is waiting for him, but the Empire is out searching for the Rebels, giving everyone a hard time. While we are waiting we get a look at the everyday life of a Wookiee family. We meet all the familiar characters from Star Wars (1977) and we are introduced to Boba Fett during a short cartoon. We also pay a visit to the Cantina and meet all the monsters again.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> The Star Wars Holiday Special was very poorly received, both by Star Wars fans and the general public.

So the opposition knows that they're at least out of a job but are even more likely to be killed along with their families. So their options are to immediately counter and stage a coup with enough support or fake support to spare their lives.\n\nIn the video, you can see these people supporting Saddam even though they're dead inside. You also see others who are not supporters of Saddam who were taken away by security forces. Those people were all killed and likely their families as well.\n\nSo the general public response is support. You do this for survival.\n\nThere's a story at the time of Stalin when he gave a speech and everyone clapped afterwards. However, Stalin never put his hand up as a gesture to stop clapping. He wanted to see how much power he had. People were clapping for five minutes and some people's hands were bleeding because they were afraid to be killed if they stopped clapping.

I was 12 years old and a Star Wars enthusiast, how could I not have known about this?  It's not like there was anything else on, all we had back then was 5 TV channels and an Atari 2600.  I'm not sure we even had the Atari in 1978 come to think of it.\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that I watched it back then and I blocked it out.  A black hole in my memory.  \n\nI tried to watch it a year or two ago, and I just couldn't.  I watched a half hour or so and then skipped around looking for some part of it that wasn't horrible.

I'd already seen Star Wars at the cinema, With no access to a VCR, the Holiday \"Special\" was as close as I'd get to watching Star Wars again before the movie came to television. I didn't quite realise how not good the special was at the time. The first ten minutes watching Chewbacca's family fuck around are like sitting through a TED talk by Helen Keller.\n\nAnd yet for some reason I misremembered the movie Star Wars because of the Holiday Special. Upon my second viewing of Star Wars when it finally came to TV I swore there was a scene cut from it where a Cantina customer pours a drink into the top of his head and a giant rat was sitting at a table. It wasn't until getting a bootleg of the Holiday Special in the 90s that I realised what my brain had done.\n\nI had conveniently forgotten that Bea Arthur also sang to the giant rat at this point, which adds weight to your repressed memories I suppose.", "id": "d289crx"}, {"comment": "It's the sort of movie that literally has no redeeming factors.

These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Much critical attention has been paid to the film's focus on sexuality and gender identity. Sharalyn Orbaugh has noted that the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell begins with the \"perfect paradoxical introduction to a narrative that is all about the nature of sex\\/gender identity and self-identity in general in a future world where sexual reproduction has given way to mechanical replication.\" Motoko's female identity and appearance are countered by an autonomous subjectivity, resulting in a \"male\" cyborg body which cannot menstruate. Orbaugh describes the juxtaposition of the opening scene depicting the creation of Motoko's body and to her lack of menstruation as setting the theme of \"reproductive sexuality in a posthuman subject.\" The film depicts Motoko's identity and ontological concerns, ending with the evolution of a being with full subjectivity, through a new form of reproduction with the Puppet Master. Austin Corbett commented on the lack of sexualization from her team as freedom from femininity, noting that Motoko is \"overtly feminine, and clearly non-female.\" Carl Slivio has called Ghost in the Shell a \"resistant film\", due to its inversion of traditional gender roles, its \"valorization of the post-gendered subject\", and its de-emphasis of the sexual specificity of the material body.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?K%F4kaku+Kid%F4tai+%281995%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3228403), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghost_in_the_shell/), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/540533), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/en/ghost_in_the_shell_1995).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F44wvva \"Confidence: 1.06\").

The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Much critical attention has been paid to the film's focus on sexuality and gender identity. Sharalyn Orbaugh has noted that the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell begins with the \"perfect paradoxical introduction to a narrative that is all about the nature of sex\\/gender identity and self-identity in general in a future world where sexual reproduction has given way to mechanical replication.\" Motoko's female identity and appearance are countered by an autonomous subjectivity, resulting in a \"male\" cyborg body which cannot menstruate. Orbaugh describes the juxtaposition of the opening scene depicting the creation of Motoko's body and to her lack of menstruation as setting the theme of \"reproductive sexuality in a posthuman subject.\" The film depicts Motoko's identity and ontological concerns, ending with the evolution of a being with full subjectivity, through a new form of reproduction with the Puppet Master. Austin Corbett commented on the lack of sexualization from her team as freedom from femininity, noting that Motoko is \"overtly feminine, and clearly non-female.\" Carl Slivio has called Ghost in the Shell a \"resistant film\", due to its inversion of traditional gender roles, its \"valorization of the post-gendered subject\", and its de-emphasis of the sexual specificity of the material body.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?K%F4kaku+Kid%F4tai+%281995%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=3228403), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghost_in_the_shell/), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/540533), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/en/ghost_in_the_shell_1995).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F44wvva \"Confidence: 1.06\").

Angier's travails take a sci-fi detour courtesy of David Bowie, and isn't that a little ridiculous? But in the end he couldn't see the forest for the trees. The trick turns out to be as simple as any. Michael Caine's monologue that both starts and ends the movie explains the entire thing.

Todd Gilchrist of IGN applauded the performances of Bale and Jackman whilst praising Nolan for making \"this complex story as easily understandable and effective as he made the outwardly straightforward comic book adaptation (Batman Begins) dense and sophisticated... any truly great performance is almost as much showmanship as it is actual talent, and Nolan possesses both in spades.\" CNN.com and Village Voice film critic Tom Charity listed it amongst his best films of 2006\\. Philip French of The Observer recommended the film, comparing the rivalry between the two main characters to that of Mozart and Salieri in the highly acclaimed Amadeus.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?The+Prestige+%282006%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The%20Prestige%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/prestige/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-prestige), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70047095), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q46551).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4uja77 \"Confidence: 1.12\").

Angier's travails take a sci-fi detour courtesy of David Bowie, and isn't that a little ridiculous? But in the end he couldn't see the forest for the trees. The trick turns out to be as simple as any. Michael Caine's monologue that both starts and ends the movie explains the entire thing. Three acts of a movie - three parts of a magic trick.\n\nIt's a masterpiece.\n\nThis isn't the only movie Nolan made as a commentary on how he views filmmaking.

These include a man who pimps his mentally ill wife to our anti-heroes, three sisters who play with their cat and practice becoming strippers, a black midget fending off the sexual advances of a troubled man (played by the director Harmony Korine), a 12-year-old gay transvestite who is also a cat killer, Solomon's mother who seems to be the only glimpse of sanity, two foul-mouthed six-year olds, and most importantly, a nymphlike skateboarder who walks around town wearing pink rabbit ears.\n(*IMDb*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Gummo+%281997%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gummo), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gummo/), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/60000642), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q332334).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4sd95z \"Confidence: 1.03\").

A few years ago, a tornado swept through it, destroying more than half the town and killing the same amount, including Solomon's father. The film, from there, chronicles the anti-social adventures these two boys have. These include sniffing glue, killing cats, having sex, riding dirtbikes, listening to black metal, and meeting a cavalcade of quirky, bizarre, and scary people. These include a man who pimps his mentally ill wife to our anti-heroes, three sisters who play with their cat and practice becoming strippers, a black midget fending off the sexual advances of a troubled man (played by the director Harmony Korine), a 12-year-old gay transvestite who is also a cat killer, Solomon's mother who seems to be the only glimpse of sanity, two foul-mouthed six-year olds, and most importantly, a nymphlike skateboarder who walks around town wearing pink rabbit ears.\n(*IMDb*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Gummo+%281997%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gummo), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gummo/), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/60000642), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q332334).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4sd95z \"Confidence: 1.03\").

Calum Marsh of The Atlantic disagreed with these critics in his 2013 article on the film, which he called a \"...satire, a ruthlessly funny and keenly self-aware sendup of right-wing militarism...\\[that\\] critiques the military-industrial complex, the jingoism of American foreign policy, and a culture that privileges reactionary violence over sensitivity and reason.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Starship+Troopers+%281997%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Starship%20Troopers%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/starship_troopers/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/starship-troopers), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/1181616), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q478626).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F57gkqi \"Confidence: 1.08\").

Service wasn't just military though. In the book you could teach or volunteer for two years. The idea Heinlein was exploring is collectivism and personal sacrifice which are easier discussed in a situation that requires sacrifice like war.\n\nAnother good one by him is [\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress) which is about a libertarian revolt on a moon colony.\n\nRegarding the movie...\n\nVerhoeven had not read the book; he attempted to do so after he bought the rights to embellish his existing film, but found that he disliked it: \"I stopped after two chapters because it was so boring... It is really quite a bad book. I asked Ed Neumeier to tell me the story because I just couldn't read the thing.\"\n\nHopefully the book makes you think and analyze these topics.

Although young then, it had a profound impact on shaping his world view.\n\nSo with that perfect storm, he was tasked with making a movie with at least somewhat an IP source that disgusted him on a personal and moral level.

Calum Marsh of The Atlantic disagreed with these critics in his 2013 article on the film, which he called a \"...satire, a ruthlessly funny and keenly self-aware sendup of right-wing militarism...\\[that\\] critiques the military-industrial complex, the jingoism of American foreign policy, and a culture that privileges reactionary violence over sensitivity and reason.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Starship+Troopers+%281997%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Starship%20Troopers%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/starship_troopers/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/starship-troopers), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/1181616), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q478626).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F57gkqi \"Confidence: 1.08\").

I have done this as a labor of love to give fans of this under-appreciated gem an alternative version to the two flawed cuts currently available on the DVD.\n\nI only acted as a fan editor and did not originate the content of this movie. MCA Universal and its associated parent companies own all rights to this material. They have released a beautiful Blu-Ray and DVD of David Lynch's classic movie, which I highly recommend you buy to demonstrate to the studio that there is market for this movie to be fully restored one day, ideally with a new master cut of the film to restore as much of the story as possible with the utmost attention to detail that I could never hope to match in this good-spirited fan effort.\n\nViewers will notice the footage from David Lynch's Theatrical Cut is expertly edited, color corrected, and sound designed better than the far poorer extended TV Cut, which was originally created without the director's authorization or oversight when the movie was prepared to air as a reconstructed mini-series for television in the late 1980's.\n\nFor this reason, the elements culled from the extended TV cut are inferior, more poorly edited, not color corrected well, and are lacking certain basic special effects (such as the Fremen's lack of blue eyes). The sound design was also of poorer quality in the TV cut, which was was particularly egregious since this film's original sound editing and design were nominated for the Oscar.\n\nIf I had the resources, time, and equipment necessary to correct these issues in a thorough re-edit of the original material, then I would gladly do so. And I would offer my services to MCA Universal free of charge to help see the project come to fruition.\n\nAs is, I only had the material available on the DVDs to work with, and used the most basic of editing software suites available. For this reason, this particular cut of the film is unavoidably choppy and rough at times. But I meticulously reconstructed Dune with nearly all the available footage of the film, with an entirely new structure differing from both the Theatrical and Extended TV Cuts to better preserve story continuity and improve the dramatic flow.\n\nDavid Lynch's efforts in bringing this film to life have been often criticized in the past, and I believe is his most unfairly maligned film. My only intention in creating this cut of Dune (1984) is to show a sliver more of his amazing directorial efforts and show more of what the film could have been were it given more time to run than the too short Theatrical Cut and if it had been edited with just a bit more care when it was released as a mini-series.

When reading the novel you can directly interact with these mindscapes through your own subjective interpretation. This interpretative interaction just isn't possible with the moving image. When someone else visualizes it you are forced to interact with these ideas through the filter of someone else's subconscious, and the physical limitations of the moving image. While that can be interesting, ultimately for me it's just adding a field of distortion to the ideas, when compared to reading it on the page. \n\nWhile this can be said for most if not all adaptations of books, I feel Dune is so dependent on the mind of the reader exploring the minds of the characters, this distortion always fails to bring anything new or interesting to the table.

It's not necessarily his fault or the studio's or the producers. It's that Dune, the source novel, is one of the densest pieces of fiction of the 20th century. Dare I say it's up there with Lord of the Rings. \n\nThe novel sets up a universe with literally 20 thousand years of history and lore set in the far future. As science fiction it goes beyond speculative fiction like Star Trek which is merely an extension of our times projected into the future. The world of Dune is a completely alien future where human society has evolved into unique groups and subgroups with their own religions, philosophies and political agendas.\n\nTrying to condense that into a two-and-a-half hour film, especially at a time when summer blockbusters were still relatively in their infancy and studios were hesitant to drop millions on two or three-part films like they do today, is a night impossible task even for a seasoned filmmaker. There is just so much stuff to cover. \n\nThe success of Star Wars in 1977 and its later films spurred many studios to come up with their own answer to an epic blockbuster and Dune was up there. Actually before George Lucas settled on making Star Wars he wanted to make a Dune adaptation but couldn't get the rights, but he recycled ideas from it into Star Wars (e.g., Tattoine the desert planet). But I digress...\n\nSo yes it's true the film is flawed. For someone whose never seen it, it comes off as very rushed, bizarre and perhaps even unintentionally comical.\n\nPersonally even with its flaws it has a number of strengths that make it a cult favorite. For one there's appearances by many contemporary and future stars such as Patrick Stewart, Kyle Maclachlan, Jose Ferrer, Dean Stockwell, Virginia Madsen, Academy Award-winning actress Linda Hunt, music superstar Sting. \n\nSpeaking of music, the awesome soundtrack by Toto and Brian Eno are another reason the film is so beloved. It's a score that perfectly captures the feeling of Dune, one that is both alien and familiar, epic and yet rocks.\n\nNow, speaking only for myself (but I imagine there are others right along side me who had similar experiences), as a child of the 80s, Dune was a staple of early cable television. I grew up watching it. It was unlike anything else on television and movies at the time. I grew up on science fiction like Star Trek, so naturally I was drawn to Dune. Its unusual narrative kept me coming back to it despite not really understanding some of its underlying meaning. Later on in highschool I had a friend who was also a fan of the movie and the novels and it was through him I finally read the novels.\n\nNow I don't want to get into the debate on David Lynch's adaptation because he altered a number of story elements that do not exist in the book. I'm of the belief he made these changes a) to expedite an already bloated story b) to make it more familiar to the general audience. Dune purists have for years lambasted Lynch's version because of these changes, but I'm fine with them.\n\nIMHO Lynch truly captured the depth and scope of the universe that Frank Herbert put down on paper. The sets and costume design and production quality of this film are unmatched. Much like the soundtrack Lynch expertly blended the familiar with the alien that was perfect for a story like Dune and it really sets the movie apart. Lynch also captured the psychological aspect of the book's characters, much like the book you're privy to their internal monologue that establishes who they are.\n\nAll these elements come together to really make Dune a truly unique film and I'm grateful that later generations of movie viewers are appreciating it more and more; I'll even go out on a limb here and even credit the Westwood Dune games of the mid-to-late 90s, which used Lynch's version as the source material, for popularizing this version of Dune.\n\nSadly the film tanked and Lynch has kind of disowned it. I hope in time he comes around to appreciating his own work because I and many others certainly do. It was ahead of its time. If his version could be re-made today it could easily be made into a three-film deal with better pacing and more authenticity to the source material.

They are also very dense with their own terminology and lore, if you like that sort of thing you'll be right at home.

It's very unique in that regard.\n\nAlso bear in mind his son Brian co-wrote prequels years later based on his father's notes with another author (Kevin J.

", "id": "cycy23o"}, {"comment": "That's interesting. What do you feel makes the movie an awful adaptation? \n\nIt's fair to say Lynch took liberties with elements of Dune (i.e., weirding modules instead of kris-wielding fremen warriors for instance), like I said I think some of them might have been necessary for expediency. It's easier to explain \"weirding modules\" i.e., \"laser guns\" to an audience than show Fremen engaging in hand to hand combat with the weirding way. Telepathy is easier to explain than the lore behind Bene Geserit training. \n\nWhile a lot of this isn't true to the book I feel like Lynch captured the spirit of the book; i.e., the religiosity of the Dune universe, the politics and the characters' motivations. \n\nAlthough Frank Herbert's books are more of a cautionary tale about messianic figures and prophecies, I'm not sure an adaptation of that theme can be captured in a movie, either stand-alone or first in a series.

I saw Dune years before I read the novels (I think I was about 16 at the time) and thought the weirding modules were awesome and I loved the politicking as I'd started to get into Babylon 5.  After I picked up Dune in a charity shop in my 20's I realised the movie was a very different beast from the book I was plughing through.  \n\nI still think they're both great and I even love the mini series, though I'm wary about anything after Chapterhouse though as I've read that the novels following on weren't great.

Accused and convicted of murdering and eating his travelling companions, he was to be executed by hanging.The movie begins at his trial, where he pleads his innocence to an unsympathetic audience. Only reporter Polly Pry will listen to his story, which is then related to the viewers in the form of flashbacks. As Packer and his gold-prospecting clients make their way through the forests and mountains, they encounter bemused Japanese Indians, an unimpressed group of mountain men and the brutal Rocky Mountain winter, all of which inspire the travellers to break out into song and dance.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Cannibal\\! currently holds a 56% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Alferd+Packer%3A+The+Musical+%281993%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=527414), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cannibal_the_musical/), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/14606642), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/en/cannibal_the_musical).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F46w64e \"Confidence: 1.00\").

He was not just an amazing pantomime actor, but a terrific speaking actor besides. He had a real knack for portraying humanity in his silent characters and films. Better than other artists of the time such as \"Stone Face\" Keaton or Lloyd because, I'd say, their skill lay pretty much exclusively in pantomime and, for Keaton in particular, stunts or slapstick (edit: not to say that Keaton wasn't an absolute genius in his own right). Such talents didn't translate well to talkies in general. Besides that, Chaplin was a brilliant director as well as an actor. A showbiz jack of all trades, this guy.
