Often, folks are too lazy/busy/whatever to do that, though, and just leave their cart in an empty parking space, or halfway jumped up onto the curb, or sometimes just right in the middle of the drive lane.\n\nCart Pushers/Cart Attendants are employees who go out to the parking lot to round up all the carts and bring them back into the store. In a perfect world, the Cart Attendant would only have to visit the handful of cart corrals, where the carts would be neatly stacked and ready to go. \n\nIn practice, the Cart Attendant often has to go all over the parking lot gathering carts that customers have left in places they don't belong. It can be very dangerous, because often drivers will travel much faster in a parking lot than safety would dictate, and because their attention is split between paying attention to hazards or obstacles and looking for a parking space closest to the door.\n\nIf more stores in the US had refundable cart deposits, like in Holland and elsewhere throughout Europe, we would be able to solve a lot of these problems, but also there is this perception that doing so would eliminate jobs, as in some stores, Cart Attendant/Cart Pusher is a full position, rather than a task for whichever bagger/stocker isn't busy right now.", "id": "dauokl0"}], [{"comment": "Really dumb question, people don't usually return their carts?

There are a lot of exceptions and you have to learn them when you study how to read English.\n\nOn the flip side, since kanji each have their own meaning, even if you don't know how to pronounce a kanji but still have seen it in another word, you can make a guess as to what the new word means. Also, it's not like the Japanese writing system is without rules. Most characters have only two or three readings (yes I know there are a lot of exceptions to that, but many of those are also common words) and some of them are phonetically based, so you can sometimes \"sound it out\" that way.

What did you expect when you forced the companies to shorten the length of the contract?\n\nBoth ways its all about money. Companies still need to make a profit, and in some cases a $60 plan is paying $30 of that to pay off the cost of the phone. I have seen it higher, but I cannot remember the phone it was on. That cuts into a company's profits, which is used to pay for employees, upgrades and expansion, etc. Now I'm not one to think that companies are purely innocent, but at some level consumers also have to understand that what they \"demand\" may very well come back to bite them in the ass.\n\nAs it was my province had already put into law that while three year contracts were still ok, the ONLY termination fee was the remaining cost of the phone.

By flagging down a worker and trying to haggle with them is basically saying 'I don't have enough money, but I really really *want* it - you need to take a monetary loss as a store and forgo profit on this one so that I can have it, because I want it, but can't manage my money well enough to simply save up until I can actually afford it.'\n\nEspecially considering that the vast majority of retail companies do not allow for haggling. It's not in the system, it's not in the procedure, it's simply not done. So to put someone who is an employee in such an awkward and uncomfortable position by pressuring them to forgo company policy and social custom just because you don't want to pay what everyone else is...this is why they called it 'sad' \n\nTL;DR - I spent my time writing it out, just read it! :-) \n\nEdit: Another important aspect I think, is that you'd be asking for special treatment for no real reason.

This translates into bigger stores, wider streets, bigger cars, larger parking lots.\n\nThere are little old ladies that can barely get their carts out to the car, let alone bring them back.\n\nAt the store I used to work at, we didn't even allow the carts into the parking lot.  I would either have to wait with the cart until someone pulled up with their car, or I'd carry all the groceries to the car myself.\n\nLastly, Canada became far less cash reliant more quickly than many other countries due to the efficiency of our *Interac* (Debit) system, so a large portion of the population doesn't even carry around loose change regularly.

I occasionally heard advice to ask them to turn off the engine and never heard anyone complain about it.

About 60% of our business is replacement rentals (insurance claims, body shop loaners) which means most people aren't renting cars necessarily because they want to. So if we get even 25% (50% going to other rental place. 25% not getting a car at all) of the people who get in accidents where a rental car is paid for that's about 15-20 replacement rental cars a week. Most replacement cars stay out for a week. Adding in about 10-15 cars a week for retail rentals that's 25-30 rentals on a good week. Average cost of a car is probably $35 a day. We also makes a lot of money by selling other products like damage waivers, satellite radio, gas, and just good ole fashioned upselling. We average about $15/day in those kinds of things; raising our gross per car per day to about $50. That's about $1250 to 1500 a week. We keep our fleet at about 90% utilization.

Idk) this. Their signs almost all have two prices, apparently one for \"with loyalty card\" one for without. It is possible even their mailer coupons require the loyalty card as well. Personally, I found the whole thing so damn confusing, I just stopped shopping there all together. It's not like there aren't plenty of other options available. It's not the only grocery in town and there are at least five others within five to ten minutes of my workplace besides.

Think a regular size shelf price tag with the two prices wedged on it. And it was like that on almost *all* the tags, instead of *just* the items with a card based discount. Which made it difficult to puzzle out what really had a special discount and what didn't without closely inspecting each tag. It made it difficult to even figure out how much you would be spending whether you had the card or not. More work than I was willing to invest on what was supposed to be a quick grocery run.\n\nThe store I prefer now has a loyalty card as well with discounts tied directly to the card (as opposed to customer loaded coupons via an app or website, though those are available too) but there are special much larger shelf hang tags for the discount clearly showing \"with card\" price (with a picture of a card beside it) beside the \"without card\" price for the few items in store directly discounted. So, when eggs are discounted with card to a dozen large for 49\u00a2 instead of the regular price of $1.09, it's not just clearly stated, but it's visible even if you're not standing *right there* in front of the eggs. It also has a greater number of items that load a fuel discount redeemable at the gas station connected to the store from having the card that might not be on special or card connected sale, but still have a larger, clearly visible hang tag announcing it. Like, for example, a pre-made salad might have a dollar discount that everyone can take advantage of, card or not, ($4 instead of the normal $5) but if you have the card you also get a 10\u00a2 off fuel discount per salad you buy. Their loyalty card is also possible to just pick up, scan, and go without taking any time to sign up in store - all registration can be done at home via their website at your convenience- and the employees only ask if you have one at checkout, no real pushing it if you don't. The most I've ever heard is \"do you want one? Ok.\"\n\nClear, visible signage combined with discounts that go beyond simple price off the product, not having to announce your information verbally to whomever is in earshot when registering, and an environment that doesn't try to force the card on you if you don't want it made it a better choice imo. Ofc, this store chain is lauded as \"employee owned\", so that might have something to do with it.", "id": "d7ue8wp"}, {"comment": "I agree with you despite the downvotes.

Upon arriving, Steinmetz rejected all assistance and asked only for a notebook, pencil and cot. According to Scott, Steinmetz listened to the generator and scribbled computations on the notepad for two straight days and nights. On the second night, he asked for a ladder, climbed up the generator and made a chalk mark on its side. Then he told Ford\u2019s skeptical engineers to remove a plate at the mark and replace sixteen windings from the field coil. They did, and the generator performed to perfection.\n\n\nHenry Ford was thrilled until he got an invoice from General Electric in the amount of $10,000.

Usually every week she stays about an hour extra per day to get things done that she didn't have time for.

The only reason she even stays is the pay is close to $20 an hour now before OT.\n\nI told her she needs to just clock in or not do it. She said when she had clocked in before for OT they actually made her sign some form where she states something like \"I did not clock out on time even though I was told to. Overtime was not allowed and I was aware of this but did it anyway.\" and then they do not pay you for that time worked.

I mean we all know how salaries work, but we also know the only way we have a chance of making money is if customers have a chance of buying food/drink, so it would be really hard to commit to being open for an extra 30 minutes or an hour each night - even if logically it's better for salary costs. We're always going to think \"what if a huge party comes in five minutes to closing?\" and want a full kitchen available if it happens - or close enough to a full kitchen to be able to satisfy the guests.\n\nFrom a guest perspective - there just aren't enough people who will pay any attention at all to the kitchen vs. dining room hours. If you have unlocked doors and let people come in, and *all the other* restaurants let you order food until *they* \"close\" then they think they can order food wherever they go as long as it's \"open\" and they always will. People don't like change and they don't adapt well to change - this is one of the reasons it's hard to change the tipping culture. Yes, partly because the people who pay the salaries benefit and have no reason to change, but also because even in states where servers get paid the full minimum wage, we tip anyway. We're used to it, we think it's the right thing to do, we grew up doing it, it's part of our culture. So we keep doing it. It's much the same with an open restaurant. You're open? You should be serving some sort of food/drink. That's how it's always worked and it's what people expect so it will be really hard to change, on both sides of the equation.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think it would be better to have kitchen hours and dining room hours too - I just understand why it doesn't really work and not many places do it. There is a restaurant here in my hometown that has such a thing and I got super annoyed with them because I called to inquire about their closing time and they just quoted a time at me - when we got there, we discovered they gave us the latest time and it was actually an hour too late to get any food. I was super annoyed about it. I've never been back. Irrational probably, but it was really upsetting. I did just ask when they closed, so it was probably my fault for not being specific - at least that's what the hostess told me when I mentioned to her that they should tell people when they call that they aren't serving food anymore so they can go somewhere else.  \n\nBut I'm sure she thinks the way her restaurant works is \"normal\" while I think the way *all* restaurants work is \"normal\" and we are both right.", "id": "d5z9kr5"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d5zcco2"}, {"comment": "The fuck is your problem?

(as if bribing me was going to work)\n\nMe: $190, and I'll even throw in the textbook for you.\n\nCustomer: The lady at the front desk said you could this, I asked her.\n\nMe: No she didn't.\n\nJust then, the assistant textbook manager (aka \"the lady at the front desk\" just happened to walk by.

A coupon, for instance, may exclude trial size items- but the system is programmed to apply the coupon anyway. This would usually be caught by the cashier, but that's not always possible at the self checkout.  \n* Applied more than one manufacturer coupon to one item (which is at least almost always not allowed).

They both throw rage fits the entire trip.\n\nStore trip two: One of the kids tell on the other to try and gain a second candy bar. This breaks rule two, and the sibling gets their candy bar. A rage fit ensues, where in the sibling who got the candy bar breaks rule three, causing a rage fit of their own. Both children lose their candy and throw fits the entire trip.\n\nStore trip three: The sibling who did not attempt to gain a second bar the first time will attempt this time, and will have a rage fit again. This kid will throw a fit the entire trip. Potentially the second kid (if s/hes not to bright) will break rule number 3 and lose his candy bar as well throwing a rage fit, if s/he is bright then s/he wont.\n\nTrip four: All children act good when a reward is involved, and know the rules/boundaries.\n\nAfter trip 4 when the kids get their candy bars, slowly reduce what they get down to nothing and they will *never* act up again in a store.\n\nYou should probably set some rules and only take the candy bar away for rule breaking that genuinely breaks the defined rules you set \"Walking away from me, screaming, being loud, begging for things, bothering other people, not listening when I tell you to do something/not do something.\" are all good rules.

We would often get catered lunch, but this was more because we were literally not allowed to leave the store. We were basically hostages who got free lunch.  Also, we got a lot of free Red Bulls from our managers who went about the store, handing them out. We were always organized. We treated it like an inevitable military invasion that we couldn't avoid, but could fight back as best as we could. We also never worked 16 hour shifts *all at once.* Some of us worked 12. If we did work 16, we were allowed to work a 'split' meaning we open, work a bit, go home and take a nap, then come back and close the store.

I have unloaded countless trucks, pallets, shuttles, and upstocked/downstocked everything from fridges to 80 in TVs, but it gets so old, so fast, on black friday. Wheeling out over a thousand TVs (not to mention the larger items, but TVs are always a guaranteed thing) on one shift made me want to throw myself off the warehouse platform to break my leg so I could get out of work. Hey, I thought about it. \n\nMy easiest role on black friday over the years? Asset protection, by leaps and bounds! I did 3 different years as AP/LP on Black Friday. I was the best at surveillance, as I was always on the cameras. My other AP/LP buddies were always checking receipts. We always had local law enforcement show up and assist with crowd control. The first hour, I opened the door only to those in line who had tickets for door busters, and the first 50-100 or so customers got their own personal shopping trip in the store, away from the others in line, before everyone else. We gave them personal shopping assistants. That way, all doorbuster people weren't frantically fighting for that stupid Kodak printer they stood in line for, in the ice cold, for 2 or 3 days. Or a digital picture frame. God I remember when we got those in, people damn near had fist fights over them outside of Black Friday.\n\nI didn't hate black friday until I worked inventory, honestly.

There are a few places around me where I have to insert the chip, enter my PIN, and then sign the receipt.\n\nAlso note PCI standards don't require banks/issuers to allow chargebacks on PIN Debit transactions. (some do, but it isn't a requirement), so with most banks if you use the PIN method you can't chargeback. PIN by definition is a personal identifier and should be kept secret, the assumption is that if the PIN was correct the cardholder was correct.\n\nEMV on the other hand isn't an identity verification feature, it is a terminal fraud prevention measure. A common fraud tactic we had to be on the lookout back a few years ago when I worked for a major credit card processing company was rogue firmware installs. A common fraud tactic back then (and still is with non-EMV terminals) is for the adversaries to go in to small businesses posing as a person from the credit card company or similar nature and say they are there to perform a software update on the terminal. (Another route was using a card that would deliberately error out the machine and then be like \"oh my card does that all the time you gotta do this this and this\") and then would install a custom firmware on the machine that when running the daily batches would \"phone home\" to the adversaries a list of all the credit card numbers used that day for harvesting.\n\nEMV prevents that because it works similar to two-factor authentication that you can get for you Google account, etcetera. In short the chip on the card has part of a cryptographic key that is also timebound as part of the decryption process. The server at the payment processor also has information needed to determine if the decryption is correct based on the time and other information about the terminal. When you put the chip in the terminal it takes the information from the chip, the time, and a unique identifier of the terminal, does some maths and then sends that off to the payment processor's server which can verify the decryption. If it passes the server will send back \"we got it from here\" and the terminal never has to know the credit card number, and due to the timelock the encryption information will only work for the minute that card was processed and only for that specific terminal.", "id": "damu98d"}, {"comment": "We wont.

Now I'm (now) quite a patient person, this job has done wonders for my patience. However in the early days, I used to get pretty frustrated with people who just wouldn't bother and just expected you to put it on their phone for them. One transaction comes to mind, on a particularly bad day for my mood- had already had several customers yelling at me for something- probably something minute which I was able to fix/sort out as soon as they explained properly. When a bloke who had been waiting in the queue for nigh on 45 minutes, asked for some PAYG credit for his third party provider.\n\nTo give some background, I work in a PhoneShop which is also surrounded by about 20+ other till which could have provided this fine gentlemen with the credit he sought. But to give him his due, he knew this because I told him the same thing, last time he stood their waiting for 40+ minutes to do a 15 second job.\n\nHe approached the till, asked for his \u00a310 PAYG credit, for the same phone he'd been using for years. I rang it through, was perfectly pleasant and provided him with his top-up voucher. Wished him a good day and went to move onto the next customer.\n\nBloke: \"Oi, you need to put this on my phone!\"\n\nStopped in my tracks I turn around to see that he's thrown his phone and the voucher back on the desk.\n\nMe: \"You'll just need to follow the instructions on the voucher to get your credit on your phone. \"\n\nI say with a forced smile, perhaps a little condescendingly, whilst pointing out the details on the voucher. He knows this, I've served him many times before and I've actually SPENT the time and shown him this a few times. I am resolved that I wont spend any more time doing this for him, especially when I have other customers who are waiting.\n\nBloke: \"I can't do it.\"\n\nI look at him. Trying not to burst out in anger at his idiotic attitude. Remember it's not been a great day already.\n\nMe: \"I'm sure you can, I've shown you previously how to do it. Just dial the number and put the code in when prompted.\"\n\nBloke: \"I cant do it.\"\n\nI see my colleague and manager look over from the customers they are individually dealing with, fairly smugly that they're not having to deal with the loon in front of me. Unfortunately this was one of the rare times in my career that I've just exploded a little, this guy was wearing me thin.\n\nMe: \"You're incapable of dialling the number and putting the code in?\" I ask incredulously. \n\nBloke (whilst smiling and looking at the other customers, who I think, he thinks are on his side, but are clearly getting just as pissed at him as he's wasting their time also): \"Yes, you'll HAVE to do it for me.\"\n\nI take a second and then take a step back to the desk. \n\nMe: \"So you can't use your phone then?\"\n\nBloke: \"What?\"\n\nMe: \"How do you use your credit, once it's on the phone, if you're unable to dial a phone number in?\"\n\nBloke stairs at my uncomfortably, I stair back. When it's clear he's not going to say any more,\n\nMe: \"We have other customers waiting, feel free to dial the number and put the code in. Your credit will be on the phone momentarily!\" \n\nI move past him and greet the next customer. The bloke stands there for (no joke) the next 30 minutes until the queue is cleared and whilst completely ignoring me, beckons my colleague over and tells them they need to put the credit on his phone.\n\nThankfully they tell him the same thing, and then our manager walks over and backs the position up.\n\nThis was nearly 5 years ago now, this bloke STILL comes in, STILL buys credit and will wait 40-50 minutes to be served some times. Refuses to buy credit at any other till and has since been incredibly rude to almost every colleague I've worked with, so much so, that most people won't serve him.\n\nI still do, but I make a point every time of making him apply it himself.\n\nBoy that took a lot longer to write than I thought, it's gone from a small anecdote to full blown novel.

I am a computer tech and worked as a lead tech at a few different national chain electronics retail stores. Anyway, at one store I was in charge of making sure all the computers/electronic devices were repaired and customers were called by certain dates, but they also wanted me to sell electronics. If I was the only tech on a shift, I was expected to do both. I couldn't be in two places at once and I would get written up either way. Either I didn't finish repairing devices on time or I didn't immediately help the customer. At this chain, they installed these metrics monitoring systems above the entrance and exit. These systems were connected with our PoS and every hour of every day it would show the managers a color (red, orange, yellow, or green), list which employees were working each hour, and the color corresponded to how many sales you made versus should have made based on the customers going through the doors. We weren't even allowed to get the shopping carts until long after the store closed so we wouldn't add non-purchasing customers to the system. Anyway, I was written up a few times because I was working during a red hour. I was also written up for not selling service/warranty plans with electronic devices. (Never buy extended warranties, it's a waste of money in most cases and most electronics already come with a manufacturer's warranty.) I was told by management that they would rather have me not sell a computer than sell one without an extended warranty and also got written up for that. The managers also had a list on their door showing all employees and how much they sold. You were shamed in front of everyone. This chain was horrible and I worked there for a few years before they fired me for too many write ups, despite the fact that I was the only tech that knew even basics about computers. None of the other techs even passed the basic tech tests that the chain requires to work on computers.

You can tell a lot about a person by their actions.  A person who deliberately ignores a closed sign and responds to a direct statement that the lane is closed by starting to unload their items in particular is not a customer that you want to keep in spite of a guaranteed sale.\n\nThis is the type of customer who is abusive to staff, abusive to other customers, abuses coupons and sales, etc.  If you want a motivated staff and happy customers this is the type of person you want to shop at your competitors store.\n\nSo, in conclusion, getting off of a register when your manager tells you too is actually a good thing in the eyes of management and leads to good reviews, raises and more hours not the opposite; customers who ignore rules or feel that rules do not apply to them annoy both employees and other customers and should be \"helped\" to decide to shop elsewhere for the benefit of the store as a whole.", "id": "d86w1zk"}, {"comment": "OP explained to the customer before she unloaded that the lane was closed.
