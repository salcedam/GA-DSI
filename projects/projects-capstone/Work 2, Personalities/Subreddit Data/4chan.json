He started spamming on stock twits about Tesla calling it a dumpster fire and just generally trolling the bulls.  Well not one week later he's sleeping and at the dead of night he is woken by a scent coming through his doorway. It took him a minute to wake up but he soon realized the smell was smoke.  He runs down the stairs of his home and bursts into his kitchen where he sees an 8 foot flame shooting up out of his garbage can.  About half his kitchen burned down before the fire department arrived and the damage cost was over 50 thousand.  The investigation showed that his back door was tampered with and someone broke the lock to enter his home, indicating foul play.  The craziest part was yet to come though. About 3 days after the event he's staying at a hotel while repairs are being done on his home and he orders some room service. The food comes up to his room and he opens the tray. Inside he finds the meal he ordered, but to the right of the plate are 8 burned matches (previously lit). And you wanna know something about those matches.

Stop. She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and kenna are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna \"get some\" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my kenna but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and kenna's love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and kenna are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give kenna my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:\"/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my kenna and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young.

It's recent and EA, however, it functions really well. It's basically hunger games without worrying about survival (other than combat)\n\nYou have an arena, rounds are typically 25ish mins, you can play solo or tag teams, everyone gets randomly spawned, and you have to kill eachother. Find loot, craft weaponry, try not to get killed. Arena gets smaller when there's around 10 minutes left for the round, others can trigger deadly gases to block off zones and flush out people from hiding. 1 part i really like is that nothing gives you an OP feeling. Got a gun? Great, anyone who can close the cap can still fuck you up, plus bullets are not easy to get. Got into a fight with a player who has trapped an entire building? Gas the fucker out so you can shoot him with your bow. \n\n\nA lot of customizing of you character with different appearances that you get for winning rounds and there are a multitude of perks that fit different playstyles. Want to go stealth archer? Pick the 40% increased bow damage and silent running perks. Want to melee everyone head on? Increased damage with blades+ extra stamina.

If someone manages to take center with a rifle, and you are the only one left without a decent ranged option, then you have just been outplayed.\n\n90% of people are so fixated on guns, they forget anything else. Even today, I was getting demolished by this dude in melee. So I ran away. Whaddaya know, 3 guys left, 5 mins in the round, im on 50hp. The same guy has got a rifle and is camping mid. My bow drop is already in the gas so I'm kinda fucked. Other guy rushes him, takes a bullet or 2, gets into melee range. While he was occupied with the guy running towards him, I managed to run up, knock the gun out of his hand, and he became so fixated on trying to get back his gun that he basically let me melee bash him for free. \n\nGuns are powerful, but they are expensive. And they do paint a giant target on your back, i've had matches where 3 guys gang up on the gun owner, without even trying to hit eachother, just because they want to get the gun out of the equation.\n\nOnce you have a decent time under your belt, guns don't win the game anymore.

Basically, Linux is what is called \"open source\", meaning anyone is free to take that code, modify it, and then share it (under the same license). It also means that, in most cases, it's a fair bit more secure because leading security experts and anyone in between can help by submitting bug fixes, not in a suggestion box, but in code. What this means for you is that your computer isn't spying on you unless you tell it to (with one specific exception on Ubuntu that was caught pretty quickly).

What you\u2019re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\n\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \u201cLinux\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\n\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine\u2019s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

The fact that the public is not allowed to know what drugs all these shooters are on is completely fucked and speaks volumes about the dangers of \"sensitivity\" police work and how the \"establishment\" doesn't give a shit how many people die, they just like to use these events as political theater.  Having looked into the details of the Sandy Hook massacre I have become convinced that there is more to the story than the mainstream is letting on.  There is just no way that Lanza was capable physically of the accuracy that is attributed to him, especially considering his weight/height and the effect of firing such a powerful rifle indoors.  It would have literally ripped his brain apart and there is no way he could have had +100% accuracy (each shot hit a kid or a teacher, supposedly, and some hit double) without being on some serious drugs.  What the fuck was he on and should I give it to my slightly scary goth teenager who the school says needs psychiatric help?  \n\nThere is also a whole dimension that hasn't been inspected: is mind control technology a factor?  I haven't been able to find any direct evidence of such technology actually working efficiently, but certain shootings (like Sirhan in the RFK incident) do seem to provide circumstantial evidence.  In Sirhan's case, the police went to such an effort to destroy all evidence that could possibly implicate a conspiracy, even though witnesses saw what may have been his \"handlers\" rejoicing right after the murder, that I feel there is enough \"smoke\" to make a \"fire.\"  Whatever the truth may be, it is disturbing to me to not have access to the evidence of these cases.  Yes, the families of the victims must be respected, but it is of greater importance to have all the information available so that we as private citizens (and voters) can make an educated decision about how to prevent catastrophe.  At the very least there has been gross incompetence by the police in many school shootings that should be exposed to the lens of public scrutiny.  In the case of Sandy Hook, the police determined by themselves *while under threat of fire* (and very quickly) that there was no point in letting EMTs through to possibly save the lives of any of the children.  Why isn't there more parental outrage?  There is no way the cops are qualified to make that call for each individual victim and the medical responders should have been let through.  The eyewitness testimony is also bizarre and confused: it implies that there was at least one more shooter that day.  Then there is the missing evacuation footage from the cop's dashcam, and so on.

It was the type of wound that had he received it on an operating room table, he would have still probably died. And he still just kept on going.

They ran him off the road, figured they outnumbered him and they didn't even bother to put on their vests.  \n\n> In the initial firefight you had 8 FBI Agents. 2 had Ithaca Model 37 shotguns. 3 had S&W 459 9mm pistols, the rest were armed with S&W revolvers and 2 of them had backup S&W revolvers. One 357 Magnum was lost in the initial car crash because the FBI guy decided the dashboard, next to a open window, was a great place to store his revolver.\n\n> The 2 criminals had a Ruger Mini-14 rifle, a 357 Magnum revolver, and a shotgun with birdshot in it. \n\n> And unfortunately for hte FBI all they had was FBI training, and both criminals were both ex-Vietnam vets with multiple tours. One was a ex-Ranger with a great deal of combat experience.  He had the Mini-14. \n\n> So they pretty much unloaded everything they had at the two criminals and didn't manage to put a 'immediate stop' to their activities.  \n\n> The fight involved several exchanges and ended up with 2 dead FBI agents and the most of the rest of them seriously wounded.  The one ex-Ranger (Platt) ended up standing over a FBI agent trying to plug him with another FBI agent's revolver, but lost the ability to focus his eyesight due to the loss of blood and missed with all the shots despite being extremely close range with no resistance. \n\n> 145 shots were exchanged. All but 1 FBI agent managed to fire their guns and all but one (a different guy) managed to be wounded or killed.\n\n> So instead of accepting that the disaster was a result of the bad decision making, lack of training, lack of marksmanship skills, and cowboy attitude on the part of the FBI agents... and despite the fact that the Platt was shot multiple times with different calibers that all failed to stop him.. they decided it was the 9mm's fault. \n\n\n> So the FBI wanted to use the 10mm pistol, because obviously giving the FBI agents less ammo to shoot was the lesson learned from this tragedy.  After a while the FBI realized that going with a magnum level semi-auto pistol was a terrible decision since it dramatically reduced the accuracy and combat effectiveness of their agents.\n\n> However they couldn't go back to the 9mm because they bad-mouthed it so much and to save face they just downgraded the power on 10mm significantly. \n\n> S&W saw this and realized a opportunity: \n\n> All these police departments and whatnot depend on their 9mm pistols and 38/357 revolvers, however the FBI says those guns are all shit, but they say a downgraded 10mm is god's gift to gun fighters despite the fact that it's has only a marginal performance increase over the 9mm. \n\n> So why not take all the 9mm pistols that the departments already own, ream out the chamber and barrels by 1mm and create a new round that will fit the 9mm pistols, but match the downgraded 10mm in performance?\n\n> This was marketing genius and thus the 40 S&W was born.\n\n> Unfortunately for S&W, Glock saw the writing on the wall and rushed their Glock 22 out the door. \n\n> Sure it had a tendendcy to blow up due to the bad chamber design, but most people didn't realize this because they used tame 40 S&W loadings. \n\n> And thus Glock took LEO market by storm.  Giving a crapload of guns away with steep discounts as long as the police would vouch for how awesome Glock is, etc etc.\n\n> Yay.\n", "id": "d14hmg8"}, {"comment": "Yeah, that's what I was talking about.", "id": "d14isx6"}, {"comment": "Yeah, but a mini 14 isnt really that mini.

On top of that the ability to shoulder a rife vs. shooting a handgun greatly increases your accuracy. \n\nAnyway, to discount the FBI's training because a couple of multi tour vets were able to them at a little more than x2 odds, is moot.

The fact that the public is not allowed to know what drugs all these shooters are on is completely fucked and speaks volumes about the dangers of \"sensitivity\" police work and how the \"establishment\" doesn't give a shit how many people die, they just like to use these events as political theater.  Having looked into the details of the Sandy Hook massacre I have become convinced that there is more to the story than the mainstream is letting on.  There is just no way that Lanza was capable physically of the accuracy that is attributed to him, especially considering his weight/height and the effect of firing such a powerful rifle indoors.  It would have literally ripped his brain apart and there is no way he could have had +100% accuracy (each shot hit a kid or a teacher, supposedly, and some hit double) without being on some serious drugs.  What the fuck was he on and should I give it to my slightly scary goth teenager who the school says needs psychiatric help?  \n\nThere is also a whole dimension that hasn't been inspected: is mind control technology a factor?  I haven't been able to find any direct evidence of such technology actually working efficiently, but certain shootings (like Sirhan in the RFK incident) do seem to provide circumstantial evidence.  In Sirhan's case, the police went to such an effort to destroy all evidence that could possibly implicate a conspiracy, even though witnesses saw what may have been his \"handlers\" rejoicing right after the murder, that I feel there is enough \"smoke\" to make a \"fire.\"  Whatever the truth may be, it is disturbing to me to not have access to the evidence of these cases.  Yes, the families of the victims must be respected, but it is of greater importance to have all the information available so that we as private citizens (and voters) can make an educated decision about how to prevent catastrophe.  At the very least there has been gross incompetence by the police in many school shootings that should be exposed to the lens of public scrutiny.  In the case of Sandy Hook, the police determined by themselves *while under threat of fire* (and very quickly) that there was no point in letting EMTs through to possibly save the lives of any of the children.  Why isn't there more parental outrage?  There is no way the cops are qualified to make that call for each individual victim and the medical responders should have been let through.  The eyewitness testimony is also bizarre and confused: it implies that there was at least one more shooter that day.  Then there is the missing evacuation footage from the cop's dashcam, and so on.

When you finally pull your collective heads out of the sand it'll be too late. The Pepe market will be oversaturated, and all our Pepes will be next to worthless. That's what they don't want you to know. I got out months ago, while the getting was good. Some of you are okay.

It could simply be black produced and written projects are so bad they don't garner attention or win awards. This creates the conundrum,  because white and Jewish screenwriters have a minority of blacks in their award winning films because they have a minority of blacks in their award winning lives. Hence, quality parts where talented black actors can excel are rare and more in line with actual nation wide ethnicity population percentage stats than with a smaller population like card carrying academy members. \n\nThere are two solutions to the problem. THE easiest on is: Change the race of characters for the sake of diversity which is hit or miss. Sam Jackson as Nick Fury for example is an okay change. Changing Hermoine Grangers race after the fact is just not.  This is a divisionary tactic meant to stir the shit pot for the sake of stirring the shit pot. The work itself will be mired and substandard, which just reinforces the stand against black actors.\n\nThe second option is to actually educate blacks when they are children and instill a sense of self worth so their minds can develop an exostential sensitivity that allows them to create written works of art that extend beyond \"being black sure is hard\". This education could and will in turn allow some of the children to grow into effective leaders able to produce and market these films, and some will use this education to create successful black owned businesses that have nothing at all to do with the entertainment or sports industries something that is also a major socitial problem that isn't being addressed. \n\nOf course the second option is a long term solution so not many people are willing to commit to it.\n\nTLDR: ooga booga, where dem Oscars at\n"], [6, "If these white actors are good enough that they deserve a trophy, they should just act black "], [4, "Finally!"], [5, "Equal isnt fair.

The online grumbling isn't that there hasn't been a black winner in the past two years, it's that there hasn't even been a non-white nominee in the past two years, making that 40/40 nominations going to white people. \n\nAnd it's not just because people of colour haven't been good in any movies the past two years, there have been notable examples like David Oyelowo in Selma last year, Idris Elba in Beasts of No Nation this year, and my personal favourite Benicio Del Toro in Sicario. You could probably think of more if you tried. Any given year will have its fair share of \"snubs\", for both white and non-white actors, but these past two years have not been kind on non-white actors in particular.\n\nHere's an expanded look at the nominees for the past 20 years:\n\n**Best Actor Nominees 1996-2015**\n\n**11/100 were black**. 2 were Spanish (Javier Bardem, twice), **87 were white Americans/Europeans**. 0 were Latin American, Middle Eastern, Asian, or African (All black nominees born in the US or UK).\n\n**Best Actress Nominees 1996-2015**\n\n**4/100 were black**. 1 was Mexican (Salma Hayek), 1 was Brazilian (Fernanda Montenegro), 1 was Spanish (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), 1 was Colombian (Catalina Sandino Moreno), 1 was half Maori (Keisha Castle-Hughes). **89 were white Americans/Europeans**. 0 were Middle Eastern, Asian, or African.\n\n**Best Supporting Actor Nominees 1996-2015**\n\n**8/100 were black**. 2 were Puerto Rican (Benicio Del Toro, twice), 1 was Spanish (Javier Bardem), 1 was Japanese (Ken Watanabe). **88 were white Americans/Europeans**. With Watanabe and Djimon Hounsou representing East Asia and Africa respectively, Middle Eastern/Arabics/South Asians are now the only region not represented here.\n\n**Best Supporting Actress Nominees 1996-2015**\n\n**9/100 were black**. 1 was Iranian (Shohreh Aghdashloo), 1 was Mexican (Adriana Barraza), 1 was Spanish (Penelope Cruz), 1 was Argentinian (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo), 1 was Japanese (Rinko Kikuchi). **86 were white Americans/Europeans.** \n\n\n**11 + 4 + 8 + 9 = 32/4 = 8%** \n\nBlacks make up 8% of the Oscar acting nominees for the past 20 years.\n\nAnd the point is that 0% of the 40 nominees in the past 2 years have been non-white. It's the idea that when we should be moving towards a more representative field of nominees, it seems we're going backwards.\n\nAs others have said, while black people may be slightly to somewhat underrepresented, it's all the other non-white ethnicities who are really getting the short shrift here. Out of the 400 nominees of the past 20 years, only a handful have gone to people who were neither white nor black (18/400). There is a rich cinematic tradition in places like Iran, Japan, Hong Kong, South America, and yet actors in those movies almost never get nominated. The only East Asian man nominated in the past 20 years was Ken Watanabe for...The Last Samurai. No actor from the Indian subcontinent has been nominated in the past 20 years. Only 1 Iranian actor has been nominated.\n\nAs it stands, 350/400 nominees of the past 20 years have been white North Americans/Europeans."], [2, "I was looking for this!

It could simply be black produced and written projects are so bad they don't garner attention or win awards. This creates the conundrum,  because white and Jewish screenwriters have a minority of blacks in their award winning films because they have a minority of blacks in their award winning lives. Hence, quality parts where talented black actors can excel are rare and more in line with actual nation wide ethnicity population percentage stats than with a smaller population like card carrying academy members. \n\nThere are two solutions to the problem. THE easiest on is: Change the race of characters for the sake of diversity which is hit or miss. Sam Jackson as Nick Fury for example is an okay change. Changing Hermoine Grangers race after the fact is just not.  This is a divisionary tactic meant to stir the shit pot for the sake of stirring the shit pot. The work itself will be mired and substandard, which just reinforces the stand against black actors.\n\nThe second option is to actually educate blacks when they are children and instill a sense of self worth so their minds can develop an exostential sensitivity that allows them to create written works of art that extend beyond \"being black sure is hard\". This education could and will in turn allow some of the children to grow into effective leaders able to produce and market these films, and some will use this education to create successful black owned businesses that have nothing at all to do with the entertainment or sports industries something that is also a major socitial problem that isn't being addressed. \n\nOf course the second option is a long term solution so not many people are willing to commit to it.\n\nTLDR: ooga booga, where dem Oscars at\n", "id": "cz59jl0"}, {"comment": "Creed.

The online grumbling isn't that there hasn't been a black winner in the past two years, it's that there hasn't even been a non-white nominee in the past two years, making that 40/40 nominations going to white people. \n\nAnd it's not just because people of colour haven't been good in any movies the past two years, there have been notable examples like David Oyelowo in Selma last year, Idris Elba in Beasts of No Nation this year, and my personal favourite Benicio Del Toro in Sicario. You could probably think of more if you tried. Any given year will have its fair share of \"snubs\", for both white and non-white actors, but these past two years have not been kind on non-white actors in particular.\n\nHere's an expanded look at the nominees for the past 20 years:\n\n**Best Actor Nominees 1996-2015**\n\n**11/100 were black**. 2 were Spanish (Javier Bardem, twice), **87 were white Americans/Europeans**. 0 were Latin American, Middle Eastern, Asian, or African (All black nominees born in the US or UK).\n\n**Best Actress Nominees 1996-2015**\n\n**4/100 were black**. 1 was Mexican (Salma Hayek), 1 was Brazilian (Fernanda Montenegro), 1 was Spanish (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), 1 was Colombian (Catalina Sandino Moreno), 1 was half Maori (Keisha Castle-Hughes). **89 were white Americans/Europeans**. 0 were Middle Eastern, Asian, or African.\n\n**Best Supporting Actor Nominees 1996-2015**\n\n**8/100 were black**. 2 were Puerto Rican (Benicio Del Toro, twice), 1 was Spanish (Javier Bardem), 1 was Japanese (Ken Watanabe). **88 were white Americans/Europeans**. With Watanabe and Djimon Hounsou representing East Asia and Africa respectively, Middle Eastern/Arabics/South Asians are now the only region not represented here.\n\n**Best Supporting Actress Nominees 1996-2015**\n\n**9/100 were black**. 1 was Iranian (Shohreh Aghdashloo), 1 was Mexican (Adriana Barraza), 1 was Spanish (Penelope Cruz), 1 was Argentinian (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo), 1 was Japanese (Rinko Kikuchi). **86 were white Americans/Europeans.** \n\n\n**11 + 4 + 8 + 9 = 32/4 = 8%** \n\nBlacks make up 8% of the Oscar acting nominees for the past 20 years.\n\nAnd the point is that 0% of the 40 nominees in the past 2 years have been non-white. It's the idea that when we should be moving towards a more representative field of nominees, it seems we're going backwards.\n\nAs others have said, while black people may be slightly to somewhat underrepresented, it's all the other non-white ethnicities who are really getting the short shrift here. Out of the 400 nominees of the past 20 years, only a handful have gone to people who were neither white nor black (18/400). There is a rich cinematic tradition in places like Iran, Japan, Hong Kong, South America, and yet actors in those movies almost never get nominated. The only East Asian man nominated in the past 20 years was Ken Watanabe for...The Last Samurai. No actor from the Indian subcontinent has been nominated in the past 20 years. Only 1 Iranian actor has been nominated.\n\nAs it stands, 350/400 nominees of the past 20 years have been white North Americans/Europeans.", "id": "cz5kh2v"}, {"comment": "But I think it's kind of implied that the Oscars is for English language cinema considering they have a separate category for foreign language films.

Then my slut ex-gf lied to my face about it for 9 months, feeding me false information and keeping me busy when they fucked. I found out at my grad party, a week after my mom dropped divorce papers on my dad. I lost my shit because I was literally witness my own life fall apart before my very eyes. So I trashed the house broke the patio glass door and tried to eat a bullet before I was put to the ground by my friends. \n\nI joined the Army (national guard) and after about 8 months of basic and AIT I came back to the same environment, and when I couldn't take it anymore I started doing heroin. I just stopped giving a fuck. Dated that same girl for 3 years until she started flipping tricks for dope money. \n\nAnd the best part is I had a moment to let my dad die. He overdosed in front of me nine months ago. Bleeding out of his nose, I thought he was dead so I shot him with like 3 things of naloxone and CPRd his bitch ass back to life. If anyone is going to put him down its gonna be me. \n\nAfter all of that, though, I still come out ahead. Clean and sober for almost a year. Full time and well paying job. He has nothing but that slut, and all he does is live in his moms basement (seriously) and pop oxy. \n\nFuck them. \n\nEdit: I've received a lot of PMs from people asking for help in beating their addictions. I've responded to nearly everyone and I'll gladly talk to you if you need help, or just need someone to listen. Don't feel afraid to ask. That said, I laid out what I did (and other options) below, so that's a good place to look if you're just looking for guidelines. Everyone is different. Some people quit by themselves, some need rehab or jail, and others never quite get it. I just wanted to say that you have to find what works for you, after all, you know yourself better than I do.\n\nA good suggestion I could give to all levels of users is to attend outpatient care. Go to meetings, go to IOP classes. Get an AODA therapist and talk to your doctor about trying suboxone or methadone. This isn't for everyone and unfortunately it can cause more harm than good in some cases, so really be honest when talking to your medical professionals. \n\nKeep trying until you're ready to quit. When that day comes you'll know what to do. I can't even begin to tell you how many times I asked people what I should do, but in the end none of their advice stuck. I paved my own path and it finally worked. Best of luck guys, you may not know it but you're capable of so much more. \n\nAlso, if you want to get some shit off your chest hit up /r/opiaterecovery or your DOCs recovery sub. There are also toll free numbers where you can call to just talk, Google would be a good resource. \n\nAgain, good luck guys. I hold no judgement and I do truly care. Addiction fucking sucks.

It took a lot for me to stop, but it all started after I went to AFR (rehab in Battle Creek, MI). It was so horrible and cult-ish (using primal forms of community therapy, and isolation torture) that I final decided to stop. Everything prior to that was nothing but a huge time waster. I truly had to want it.\n\nAfter that I unfortunately did relapse, but in January of 2015 I started tapering down my 2g a day heroin habit. By March I was doing a tenth a day and struggled through some horrible WDs. Because of my lowered tolerance I was ODing about three times a month and I knew I was going to die soon. I was prepared for it. \n\nIn April I picked up a few domestic charges because I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I was then put on bond monitoring program because the DA couldn't catch me dealing and they wanted to stop me any way they could. \n\nSo I got clean cold turkey with the help of Imodium (no suboxone or methadone, but because I was already tapered and I did my detox in jail so it wasn't too hard) Shortly after my father relapsed and I saved his life. Scared the fuck out of me even if I hate the man. I picked up another charge for attempted manslaughter but it was dropped to my UA results being clean and my grandparents statements. I knew, however, the DA would come at me with fire and brimstone if I was involved in anything else. I started planing my future.\n\nIn June a good friend of mine was killed via negligence by my ex. She shot him up and then passed out. He died in his sleep. That was the first day I legitimately felt emotion, even if many of my friends had died. I think it's mainly because she called me that night and asked for a place to sleep, and when I told her no she probably offered him sex for a bed and some dope. No matter what I played a part in his death. Her charge was dropped because of her pussy pass and, police deemed it a suicide. \n\nFrom that day forward I vowed to never touch heroin again. Like I said, I'd been clean but I had thoughts of relapse and that set me straight. \n\nSo, how do you do it? I believe there are three ways. \n\n1) if you're ready to quit go to nice rehab and put the effort in. If you're motivated and want to leave your environment most rehabs will place you in sober living (locations all throughout the U.S.)\n\n2) if you're ready to quit start tapering. If it's opiates you're addicted to stock up on: Imodium; DPH; DXM; tums; ibuprofen; a benzo (if you can); protein and potassium. Try doing a rapid taper and then ween down slowly after you've halved your dose three or four times. After six months your goal should be to be completely clean. Once you're clean get looking for a job. Get your foot in the door. Find a hobby, it will be rough. You will be sick. You will want to blow your brains out. But you can do it. Once you've done all of this you're ready to move out and start your life. \n\n3) if you're not ready to quit simply keep using until the DA catches on and they keep throwing charges until something eventually sticks,. You'll either quit immediately, or fuck around and go to prison. Repeat until it finally clicks or until you die. \n\nShits not easy man. I've done pills since I was 13 and I've done heroin (IV) from 18 until 21. It took option 3 for me, but I feel like option 2 was working (only because I wanted to quit).\n\nFeel free to msg me if you're feeling down and just want to talk, I'll be here for you.", "id": "cyrk9o6"}, {"comment": "> they give him an allowance\n\nfucking kek", "id": "cyrjf41"}], [{"comment": ">He's not like normal dads\n\nWhat the fuck does that mean? \n\nOP if your not an hero by now post some backstory you fucking shit muncher", "id": "cyrnloh"}], [{"comment": "He should have beheaded them or something as is the tradition in his country.", "id": "cyri5mt"}, {"comment": "[Me reading this thread] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/By8s65rCEAEa0Fz.jpg) ", "id": "cyrlcv4"}], [{"comment": "The chandelier reflected in the first screen shot looks pretty nice.", "id": "cyrhzmq"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "cyrf14v"}, {"comment": "The moment the dad got offended and they decided to meet at a hotel while the mum fucking lets all this happen.\n\nWhat am i reading, this can't be real life", "id": "cyrl8wg"}, {"comment": "Dad definitely fucked OP's girlfriend at the hotel while his mum watched...

His father carried on an affair with his son's gf for months without any guilt. When confronted about it, he attacked the son and called *him* pathetic. Then, he tried to get the gf to \"meet him at a hotel.\" He was clearly using the threat of sleeping with the gf again to coax his son into meeting with him. Absolutely no remorse. He's a clear narcissist. \n\nThe mother is just as disgusting. She knew about it, and she hid it from the son?? The fuck? She should have divorced the father, and kept her son away from him. SHE SHOULD HAVE PROTECTED HER SON. She didn't, and that means she failed at being a mother. She is no better than if she had just dumped him off in a gutter when he was an infant. \n\nThe thing that really gets me is what the girl kept saying:\n\n>You know your dad isn't a normal dad\n\nShe tried to justify her infidelity by claiming his dad was more attractive than most dads. Jesus fucking Christ. I want to change my original thought on her. I don't think Andy should never see her again. I think he should meet with her once, get her to do all sorts of depraved and shameful sex acts to repent and show him that she's sorry.

She averted her eyes. \"Look, just turn yourself right side up.\"\n\nThe Sorting Hat caught her hesitation and moved in for the kill. \"Look, no one is here but me and you, I won't tell anyone, my penis is as soft as butter and tastes like popcorn.\"\n\nHermione was trying to analyze whether that last statement meant something positive or negative when the hat bounded forward and locked her in a kiss.\n\nShe froze in surprise and a bit of horror as The Sorting Hat's mouth moved open and closed over her tongue, causing her to spit pieces of lint.\n\n\"What are you doing?!\" She spat.\n\n\"I know you want me Hermione.\" The hat said huskily and he jumped up in the air. Hermione watched him startled, almost in slow-mo, her mouth open. The hat's penis landed perfectly as planned in her widened mouth and began bobbing up and down.\n\nHermione was almost too weirded out to take stock of the situation. She felt frozen in time, watching the hat's eyes squinting intensely. Before she had time to react the hat groaned and a blob of gooey cum dripped down her throat.\n\nThe hat jumped off and Hermione gagged.\n\n\"How dare you!\" she screamed at the hat that looked dreamy eyed and content.\n\n\"You know you liked it.\" The hat said confidently.\n\nHermione made a sound of fury and stormed from the room.\n\n", "id": "da84h4h"}, {"comment": "Part 2.

Maybe now and then I'll get some kind of warm feeling inside, but for the most part my life is just a cold plastic facade. I think it's because of an experience I had when I was a little girl.\n\nAll I knew about our situation was that we weren't allowed to leave of our own volition. Occasionally, a stranger would come in and pick one of us out, and that one would be taken away, usually never to be seen again. The ones that did come back were... broken. Usually, it was like they had something missing, a crucial piece of themselves. We were always in fear of who would get taken next. We did know, though, that they preferred to take the smaller ones first.\n\nI was just sitting with a few other like-minded fellows, minding my own business, when some guy comes into the room. He looks all of us over, he's thinking about something. Eventually, his eyes settle on me. \"Yeah, that one,\" he says. He walks over and just picks me up like it was no effort at all. I find myself unable to resist. He takes me over to another strange man, and they start discussing price. He pays, and leaves with me in his arms. The man roughly tosses me in the back of his car, and starts driving. I have no idea where we're going. I am terrified. \n\nWe stop, and he picks me up and carries me indoors. As soon as we get inside, he starts undressing me. Taking out a pair of scissors, snipping away at my feeble covering, leaving nothing to the imagination about my physique. He uncoils a line and hooks me up to a slot in the wall. This guy was prepared. He props me up on a table, and leaves. I couldn't go anywhere, being latched to the wall, but I heard him rummaging around in the next room.\n\nAt this point he comes back into the room. He has a hungry look on his face. My mind races as he grabs me. He starts manipulating parts of my body, twisting and pressing, \"getting me ready,\" he says. I try to squirm away but I can't move. I feel completely immobile. Suddenly, he turns me around, exposing my most private place. There's a brief moment of respite, and then I feel myself getting stuffed. It goes on for minutes, both of my holes filled to the brim. I hate it. No matter how much I hate it though, I can't suppress the warm feeling inside. The warm sensation grows and grows, becoming hot. Too hot. My mind goes blank and I cry out:\n\n\"DING!!\"\n\nAnd that's when I remembered I was a toaster, and toasters don't have emotions anyway."], [79, "c-can I get sauce on that pic, b-bossman ..?

Maybe now and then I'll get some kind of warm feeling inside, but for the most part my life is just a cold plastic facade. I think it's because of an experience I had when I was a little girl.\n\nAll I knew about our situation was that we weren't allowed to leave of our own volition. Occasionally, a stranger would come in and pick one of us out, and that one would be taken away, usually never to be seen again. The ones that did come back were... broken. Usually, it was like they had something missing, a crucial piece of themselves. We were always in fear of who would get taken next. We did know, though, that they preferred to take the smaller ones first.\n\nI was just sitting with a few other like-minded fellows, minding my own business, when some guy comes into the room. He looks all of us over, he's thinking about something. Eventually, his eyes settle on me. \"Yeah, that one,\" he says. He walks over and just picks me up like it was no effort at all. I find myself unable to resist. He takes me over to another strange man, and they start discussing price. He pays, and leaves with me in his arms. The man roughly tosses me in the back of his car, and starts driving. I have no idea where we're going. I am terrified. \n\nWe stop, and he picks me up and carries me indoors. As soon as we get inside, he starts undressing me. Taking out a pair of scissors, snipping away at my feeble covering, leaving nothing to the imagination about my physique. He uncoils a line and hooks me up to a slot in the wall. This guy was prepared. He props me up on a table, and leaves. I couldn't go anywhere, being latched to the wall, but I heard him rummaging around in the next room.\n\nAt this point he comes back into the room. He has a hungry look on his face. My mind races as he grabs me. He starts manipulating parts of my body, twisting and pressing, \"getting me ready,\" he says. I try to squirm away but I can't move. I feel completely immobile. Suddenly, he turns me around, exposing my most private place. There's a brief moment of respite, and then I feel myself getting stuffed. It goes on for minutes, both of my holes filled to the brim. I hate it. No matter how much I hate it though, I can't suppress the warm feeling inside. The warm sensation grows and grows, becoming hot. Too hot. My mind goes blank and I cry out:\n\n\"DING!!\"\n\nAnd that's when I remembered I was a toaster, and toasters don't have emotions anyway.", "id": "czlj752"}, {"comment": "This is pure art", "id": "czlkdbi"}, {"comment": "thanks i make more on /r/aofhaocv if you wanna read more shitposts", "id": "czlkhi4"}, {"comment": ">if you wanna read more shitposts\n\nH'WELL.

I know, I know. But, you must admit the preponderance is building rapidly. The studies about long term effects will not be conclusive for many years, but there are some common sense factors which can make someone unafraid to stick their neck out a millimeter or two willing to call a duck-like-object a duck. We know that caloric restriction is linked to longer lifespans, because the metabolism slows into a less growth-oriented mode. Ketogenic diets induce this mode even without caloric restriction, as it is actually sugar which induces the higher metabolic rate. We know that vegetarianism has nutritional problems due to the human digestive system being adapted as a high-efficiency, low-strength system. We rely on a broad omnivorous diet and cooking our food to get maximum nutrition out of minimum energy usage in digestion. Vegetarianism has obvious nutritional gaps, proven by the necessary vegetarian obsession with proving that those gaps can be overcome. They can be overcome, but it is more draining on the human body to do so than to simply be give the more easily digestible food for those nutrients: meat. Eating ketogenic diets, particularly paleo style diets, gives the body the easiest source it can for each nutrient. As well, paleo also goes a step further in trying to reduce inflammatory and fermenting foods, which will plausibly have many currently unknown positive effects. Vegetarianism, in order to supplement the missing nutrients, has no choice but to eat many inflammatory and fermenting foods. So, you're right, there's no hard proof to say ketogenic diets are better then sugar diets in the long term, yet, but I think it's obvious enough with what we already know to say it outside of a science journal and be entirely confident I'm right.\n\n> Also I'd still like to see a study on this, though I doubt there exists one.\n\nThe other poster mentioned the Seventh Day Adventists studies, which did find that vegetarians lived longer than (what they defined as) meat eaters.

Not even close. There are several countries in that region who supply cheap labor to the rest of the world and they don't have nearly the same problems as China. The same lack of safety regulations & accidents. Oh they have them, but they're not nearly as common. \n\nReason being? All of that isn't the fault of cheap manufacturing -- the reason is China's lightening quick expansion and modernization. They're trying hard to emulate America and trying to do it in the shortest possible time. It took America 70+ years to get where it's at today, and it has had plenty of time to see *why* certain regulations are needed. China is trying to catch up in less than 20.

A corporation now has two gigantic new burdens it never had before Bain Capital stepped into the picture: tens of millions in annual debt service, and millions more in \"management fees.\" Bain needs to continue the giant bonuses for management in order to retain control of the company, so the cuts invariably come out of the benefits and payroll of the hourly workforce.\n\nOnce all that debt is added, one of two things can happen. The company can fire workers and slash benefits to pay off all its new obligations to the investment banks and Bain, leaving it ripe to be resold by Bain at a huge profit. Or it can go bankrupt, leaving behind one or more shuttered factory towns. Either way, Bain wins. By power-sucking cash value from even the most rapidly dying firms, private equity raiders like Bain tend to get their cash back before the target company fails. \n", "id": "d3j94fs"}, {"comment": "I  don't get how Bain borrows cash by having the target company be liable.\n\nAlso, if this is common knowledge, I don't get how Bain is in business at all.", "id": "d3jew13"}, {"comment": "I guess you could buy the company outright, then take a loan of that 80% in the company's name.

They were sent to the hijacking of a plane that would be launched against the \"statue-symbol of the Christian infidels.\"\n\nRecords of the Federal Police show that the two terrorists arrived in Rio on Sunday, November 1, at 21h47m, an Air France flight.\n\nThe mission began to suffer delays already in the landing when the luggage was lost, following a flight to Paraguay.\n\nAfter nearly six hours of stress in many counters and communication difficulties because of bad English, the two left the airport, advised by the Airport officials to return the next day with an interpreter. The two terrorists caught a illegal taxi outside the airport, and the driver realized that they were foreigners and ran two hours around the city to charge them more, to leave them in a really bad side of Rio called Baixada Fluminense. On the way, he stopped the car and with the help of three accomplices, the terrorists were assaulted and beaten.\n\nThey managed to save a few dollars they had hidden in their own belts to transport money and hitched a ride on a truck that delivered gas. On Monday, the 7h33m thanks to guerrilla training in Afghanistan, the two terrorists manage to get a Copacabana hotel.\n\nThen rented a car and got lost in Rio again in a bad side of town called Rocinha and the car was totally hosed again but because of the terrorist training, they was got away. Returned to the airport, determined to just hijack a plane and throw it in the middle of Christ the Redeemer. They face a monster jam because of a demonstration of students and teachers on strike - and three hours were stopped at Brazil Ave,  near Manguinhos they had their watches were stolen. At 12.30 pm, they decide to go to the center of town and looking for a money exchange and exchange the little that's left of money.\n\nReceived fake$ 100 bills, they used $1 bills to fake.\n\nFinally, at 15h45m arrive at Tom Jobim Airport to hijack a plane.\n\nAirline staff and passengers are stationed in the airport lounge, playing music and shouting slogans against the government.\n\nThe Police came punching everyone, including the terrorists.\n\nThe terrorists were driven to the police station at the airport, accused of drug trafficking, they had bags of cocaine planted in their pockets.\n\nAt 18 hours, while the prison was being attacked by a gang called Red command, they manage to escape from the police station in the confusion and shooting. At 19h05 they run counter to the GOL Airlines to buy the tickets.\n\nBut the employee who sold them the tickets omits the information that the company's flights are suspended. They then discuss among themselves, begin to doubt destroying Rio de Janeiro, in the end, is a terrorist act or a favor.\n\nAt 23:30, dirty, sore and starving, they decide to get something to eat at the airport restaurant. They ask sandwiches barbecue with cheese curds and lemonades. Only on Tuesday, at 4h35m, they recover from food poisoning equine proportions due to expired meat in sandwiches. They were taken to the Hospital called Miguel Couto, after waiting three hours for help to arrived and had to wait for a bed in public hospitals. In the hospital, they were attended by an ugly nurse, thick, fat and grumpy.\n\nDebilitated, they were only discharged on Sunday.\n\nSunday 18h20h: the terrorists of the Islamic State were out of the hospital and arrived near the Maracana stadium. Flamengo had just lost the game. The Angry fans confuse terrorists with members of the opposing team, and gave them an unprecedented beating. The head of the fanclub was called \"P\u00e9 de Mesa,\" who used to sexually abused them.\n\nAt 19h45m finally they were left alone, in terrible pain throughout the body, especially in proctologic area (anus). Seeing a nearby bar, they decide to get drunk once in their life (even if it is sin, fuck Allah!). They take a shot of cacha\u00e7a adulterated with methanol, got sick again and need to return to the Hospital Miguel Couto. Doctors also diagnose gonorrhea in swollen retofuricular sector (P\u00e9 de Mesa does not forgive!).\n\nMonday, 23h42m: the two terrorists fleeing  Rio hidden in the back of an appliance truck, robbed hours after the Serra das Araras. Disoriented, hungry, unable to walk and sit, they are taken by van to an NGO linked to human rights.\n\nTraveling laying sideways. They manage to escape from the Ong the next day and wandering around looking for food. Tiredm they end up falling asleep under a awning from store.\n\nThe Federal Police has not yet revealed the hospital where the two were hospitalized in serious condition after nearly beaten to death by a group of  beggars killers .

They were sent to the hijacking of a plane that would be launched against the \"statue-symbol of the Christian infidels.\"\n\nRecords of the Federal Police show that the two terrorists arrived in Rio on Sunday, November 1, at 21h47m, an Air France flight.\n\nThe mission began to suffer delays already in the landing when the luggage was lost, following a flight to Paraguay.\n\nAfter nearly six hours of stress in many counters and communication difficulties because of bad English, the two left the airport, advised by the Airport officials to return the next day with an interpreter. The two terrorists caught a illegal taxi outside the airport, and the driver realized that they were foreigners and ran two hours around the city to charge them more, to leave them in a really bad side of Rio called Baixada Fluminense. On the way, he stopped the car and with the help of three accomplices, the terrorists were assaulted and beaten.\n\nThey managed to save a few dollars they had hidden in their own belts to transport money and hitched a ride on a truck that delivered gas. On Monday, the 7h33m thanks to guerrilla training in Afghanistan, the two terrorists manage to get a Copacabana hotel.\n\nThen rented a car and got lost in Rio again in a bad side of town called Rocinha and the car was totally hosed again but because of the terrorist training, they was got away. Returned to the airport, determined to just hijack a plane and throw it in the middle of Christ the Redeemer. They face a monster jam because of a demonstration of students and teachers on strike - and three hours were stopped at Brazil Ave,  near Manguinhos they had their watches were stolen. At 12.30 pm, they decide to go to the center of town and looking for a money exchange and exchange the little that's left of money.\n\nReceived fake$ 100 bills, they used $1 bills to fake.\n\nFinally, at 15h45m arrive at Tom Jobim Airport to hijack a plane.\n\nAirline staff and passengers are stationed in the airport lounge, playing music and shouting slogans against the government.\n\nThe Police came punching everyone, including the terrorists.\n\nThe terrorists were driven to the police station at the airport, accused of drug trafficking, they had bags of cocaine planted in their pockets.\n\nAt 18 hours, while the prison was being attacked by a gang called Red command, they manage to escape from the police station in the confusion and shooting. At 19h05 they run counter to the GOL Airlines to buy the tickets.\n\nBut the employee who sold them the tickets omits the information that the company's flights are suspended. They then discuss among themselves, begin to doubt destroying Rio de Janeiro, in the end, is a terrorist act or a favor.\n\nAt 23:30, dirty, sore and starving, they decide to get something to eat at the airport restaurant. They ask sandwiches barbecue with cheese curds and lemonades. Only on Tuesday, at 4h35m, they recover from food poisoning equine proportions due to expired meat in sandwiches. They were taken to the Hospital called Miguel Couto, after waiting three hours for help to arrived and had to wait for a bed in public hospitals. In the hospital, they were attended by an ugly nurse, thick, fat and grumpy.\n\nDebilitated, they were only discharged on Sunday.\n\nSunday 18h20h: the terrorists of the Islamic State were out of the hospital and arrived near the Maracana stadium. Flamengo had just lost the game. The Angry fans confuse terrorists with members of the opposing team, and gave them an unprecedented beating. The head of the fanclub was called \"P\u00e9 de Mesa,\" who used to sexually abused them.\n\nAt 19h45m finally they were left alone, in terrible pain throughout the body, especially in proctologic area (anus). Seeing a nearby bar, they decide to get drunk once in their life (even if it is sin, fuck Allah!). They take a shot of cacha\u00e7a adulterated with methanol, got sick again and need to return to the Hospital Miguel Couto. Doctors also diagnose gonorrhea in swollen retofuricular sector (P\u00e9 de Mesa does not forgive!).\n\nMonday, 23h42m: the two terrorists fleeing  Rio hidden in the back of an appliance truck, robbed hours after the Serra das Araras. Disoriented, hungry, unable to walk and sit, they are taken by van to an NGO linked to human rights.\n\nTraveling laying sideways. They manage to escape from the Ong the next day and wandering around looking for food. Tiredm they end up falling asleep under a awning from store.\n\nThe Federal Police has not yet revealed the hospital where the two were hospitalized in serious condition after nearly beaten to death by a group of  beggars killers . The spokesman Federal Police stated that, after the two leave the ICU, will be collected on illegal immigrants sector in Brasilia, where they will remain until the Ministry of Justice to authorize the deportation of two poor guys, if the government finds money to pay for it, of course.\n\nThe two terrorists found unnecessary to attack Brazil and elect Rio de Janeiro as specialized training area.\n\nEdit: Fixed some English issues in the translation.", "id": "d645d48"}, {"comment": "> At 19h45m finally they are left alone, in terrible pain throughout the body, especially in proctologic area.

Then a whole group of girls in the class come over and start screaming at me for doing this and not apologising, I'm like \"I didn't do anything wrong we had a natural accident, also I never got the chance\".

He admired the grand view his mansion a few miles away from the divided West Berlin, where is main office for the national socialist party is. He was usually there but there was an assassination attempt a few days prior to today. He was wondering what it was all about. Why were they doing this. \n     \"I'm just making the world a better place\" he thought out loud. But his mistress Eva Braun prevented him from continuing his thought. She told him not to worry. She told him to be calm but he just couldn't understand. To this day he's helped the world by ridding the world of over 6,000,000 Jews. \n      \"Am I not doing good enough?\" He asked. She gave him a very unwary look. She wasn't sure herself. Despite this, she assured him that everything was going to be okay. \n     He was then informed by a guard that the bombing of Berlin continued. This particular guard he liked. He always seemed to be very down to earth and genuine guy. He has a wife and kids. Shweinstager was his name. He was a footballer but when the war started he turned to the SS. He was a very good soldier so his promotions came quick. Now he is Hitlers main body guards. The guard and Eva leaving the room returned him to his original thoughts. He couldn't come to a conclusion. He left it alone for now. \n\n50 years later: Two old men are catching up at a crowded coffee shop in Brazil named Caf\u00e9 de Primos when a short, petite Brazilian waitress walks up to them and asks if they want something. One of the men asks for a Brown Bean. A very popular drink with tourists as well as regulars. She asks him what name she should write on the cup, the old man says \"Joseph\". \n      When she walks away Joseph asks the other man \n     \"How did you make it out alive\"? His reply is very quiet as age has made this man very soft spoken. He says \n     \"Well I heard explosions coming from outside so I figured I had to get out of there. I was trying to come up with a solution but there was none. I couldn't think.\" He now had a bead of sweat moving slowly down his forehead. He now seemed visibly stressed.   \n     \"I told Eva we shall not go out by the hands of the Americans, but our own. I then took two small capsules out of my pocket and told her it's cyanide.\" His hands started shaking and more sweat was coming off of his now saturated brow. \n     \"I gave her the pill and we both inhaled it after saying our last goodbyes. All of the guards left the room and shut the door. Eva's kicked in quickly and she collapsed into my arms within minutes of ingesting the death pill. But I had done something I was not particularly proud of. I had a sugar pill.\" This caused Joseph to go wide eyed. \n     \"Adolf are you fucking serious?\" He said in a voice that was just short of yelling. Adolf got the him to calm down so he can explain himself a little more. \n     \"There was a way out of the bunker that only I knew of. If more than one person went then I would've been found out and most likely hanged. I wanted to Avoid this at all costs so I had my mistress kill herself. I then fired a shot off into the bunker and left through the secret exit. I had the world after me. I got out in a forest just outside of Berlin and ran. I made it to an unliberated camp where I was shaved completely by my soldiers who instantly recognized me. I told them my situation and they protected me. They ended up throwing me into a house full of scum which I had set out to eliminate. The next day the camp was liberated and I was sent out with the other \"prisoners\". I told them I was from Brazil so they sent me on a plane to Rio and I've been traveling ever since.

But of course the girls did the same thing, picking all their besties, then divvying up the boys on the basis of who they thought was cute, and then finally picking the girls they hated the least. \n\nSo a lot of times we ended up with some severely uneven teams talent-wise, with one team having all the star athlete boys and the other with all the betas and fatties.\n\nAnywho, the gym teacher would only let girls pitch. No shit. So she picked the most beta girl on the opposite team to pitch to me. She couldn't even underhand the ball to the plate. So she moved her closer. Still either came up short or tried to power it and threw the ball 10 yards foul. Kept moving her closer until she was about 5 feet in front of me.\n\nShe lobbed a floater right over the plate in the absolute sweet spot of the strike zone. The ball just hung there. I stepped into it and cranked the aluminum bat into the ball with all my might. It shot into her stomach like a missile, and seemingly cut her in half as she flew backwards in a < shape.\n\nGym was just after lunch so she started puking her guts out.

"], [12, "Don't be a fucking sadcunt"], [6, "Depression is:\n\n> That dead-eyed anhedonia is but a remora on the ventral flank of the true predator, the Great White Shark of pain. Authorities term this condition clinical depression or involutional depres\u00acsion or unipolar dysphoria. Instead of just an incapacity for feeling, a dead\u00acening of soul, the predator-grade depression Kate Gompert always feels as she Withdraws from secret marijuana is itself a feeling. It goes by many names \u2014 anguish, despair, torment, or q.v. Burton's melancholia or Yevtuschenko's more authoritative psychotic depression \u2014 but Kate Gompert, down in the trenches with the thing itself, knows it simply as It.\n\n> It is a level of psychic pain wholly incompatible with human life as we know it. It is a sense of radical and thoroughgoing evil not just as a feature but as the essence of conscious existence. It is a sense of poisoning that pervades the self at the self's most elementary levels. It is a nausea of the cells and soul. It is an unnumb intuition in which the world is fully rich and animate and un-map-like and also thoroughly painful and malignant and antagonistic to the self, which depressed self It billows on and coagulates around and wraps in Its black folds and absorbs into Itself, so that an almost mystical unity is achieved with a world every constituent of which means painful harm to the self. Its emotional character, the feeling Gompert describes It as, is probably mostly indescribable except as a sort of double bind in which any/all of the alternatives we associate with human agency \u2014 sitting or standing, doing or resting, speaking or keeping silent, living or dying \u2014 are not just unpleasant but literally horrible.\n\n> It is also lonely on a level that cannot be conveyed. There is no way Kate Gompert could ever even begin to make someone else understand what clin\u00acical depression feels like, not even another person who is herself clinically depressed, because a person in such a state is incapable of empathy with any other living thing. This anhedonic Inability To Identify is also an integral part of It. If a person in physical pain has a hard time attending to anything except that pain, a clinically depressed person cannot even perceive any other person or thing as independent of the universal pain that is digesting her cell by cell. Everything is part of the problem, and there is no solution. It is a hell for one.\n\n> The authoritative term psychotic depression makes Kate Gompert feel especially lonely. Specifically the psychotic part. Think of it this way. Two people are screaming in pain. One of them is being tortured with electric current. The other is not. The screamer who's being tortured with electric current is not psychotic: her screams are circumstantially appropriate. The screaming person who's not being tortured, however, is psychotic, since the outside parties making the diagnoses can see no electrodes or measurable amperage. One of the least pleasant things about being psychotically depressed on a ward full of psychotically depressed patients is coming to see that none of them is really psychotic, that their screams are entirely appro\u00acpriate to certain circumstances part of whose special charm is that they are undetectable by any outside party. Thus the loneliness: it's a closed circuit: the current is both applied and received from within.\n\n- David Foster Wallace"], [6, "Actually, depression is caused by a lack of 420 cell in the brain. \n\n[Source](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-MDuM8HvJ8)"], [2, "Guess I'd better start drinking more orange juice."], [2, "Shit, I gotta get me some orange up in here.

Authorities term this condition clinical depression or involutional depres\u00acsion or unipolar dysphoria. Instead of just an incapacity for feeling, a dead\u00acening of soul, the predator-grade depression Kate Gompert always feels as she Withdraws from secret marijuana is itself a feeling. It goes by many names \u2014 anguish, despair, torment, or q.v. Burton's melancholia or Yevtuschenko's more authoritative psychotic depression \u2014 but Kate Gompert, down in the trenches with the thing itself, knows it simply as It.\n\n> It is a level of psychic pain wholly incompatible with human life as we know it. It is a sense of radical and thoroughgoing evil not just as a feature but as the essence of conscious existence. It is a sense of poisoning that pervades the self at the self's most elementary levels. It is a nausea of the cells and soul. It is an unnumb intuition in which the world is fully rich and animate and un-map-like and also thoroughly painful and malignant and antagonistic to the self, which depressed self It billows on and coagulates around and wraps in Its black folds and absorbs into Itself, so that an almost mystical unity is achieved with a world every constituent of which means painful harm to the self. Its emotional character, the feeling Gompert describes It as, is probably mostly indescribable except as a sort of double bind in which any/all of the alternatives we associate with human agency \u2014 sitting or standing, doing or resting, speaking or keeping silent, living or dying \u2014 are not just unpleasant but literally horrible.\n\n> It is also lonely on a level that cannot be conveyed. There is no way Kate Gompert could ever even begin to make someone else understand what clin\u00acical depression feels like, not even another person who is herself clinically depressed, because a person in such a state is incapable of empathy with any other living thing. This anhedonic Inability To Identify is also an integral part of It. If a person in physical pain has a hard time attending to anything except that pain, a clinically depressed person cannot even perceive any other person or thing as independent of the universal pain that is digesting her cell by cell. Everything is part of the problem, and there is no solution. It is a hell for one.\n\n> The authoritative term psychotic depression makes Kate Gompert feel especially lonely. Specifically the psychotic part. Think of it this way. Two people are screaming in pain. One of them is being tortured with electric current. The other is not. The screamer who's being tortured with electric current is not psychotic: her screams are circumstantially appropriate. The screaming person who's not being tortured, however, is psychotic, since the outside parties making the diagnoses can see no electrodes or measurable amperage. One of the least pleasant things about being psychotically depressed on a ward full of psychotically depressed patients is coming to see that none of them is really psychotic, that their screams are entirely appro\u00acpriate to certain circumstances part of whose special charm is that they are undetectable by any outside party. Thus the loneliness: it's a closed circuit: the current is both applied and received from within.\n\n- David Foster Wallace", "id": "cyt3w7x"}, {"comment": "I'm pretty sure its from a lack of orange.", "id": "cyt4tkx"}, {"comment": "Hey bro what color is my brain right now?", "id": "cyt59em"}, {"comment": "Blue af", "id": "cyt7j1d"}, {"comment": "Fuck :( thanks for checking for me", "id": "cytacnw"}, {"comment": "What's this from of his?

She begins tugging and stroking as her twat moistens, her breasts swelling and her nipples begin to stick out like erasers on a fresh #2 pencil. She grunts with satisfaction as the pig begins eagerly thrusting into her hand, her grip now tightening to maintain control of the pig's greasy corkscrew cock. She lowers her head to watch the cock work in her hand, groans with satisfaction and begins working her clit with her other muddy hand, her hips gyrating with the rhythm of the pig's thrusting.\n\n\"Oh fucking jesus god yes..\" she gasps. She changes positions, still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the pig's squealing intensifies. She leans forward and with her lips almost touching the pig's ear, she whispers your name and begins to shudder. She turns her attention again to the pigs swollen member rocking in her hand. She presses it between her hand and her face, the pig thrusting it against her cheeks as she drools. With a massive grunt and a high pitched squeal, the pig's balls explode, beginning a massive shower of hot, sour pig jizz. You mother cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in her hand as the thrusting comes to an end. The pig shudders and begins to walk to the trough of slop in the corner of it's pen, but your mother tackles it to the ground. She lifts it's tail and smears the handful of pig load into the pig's own fetid butthole, turning flakes of crusty pig shit into a pigshit-pigjizz mud slop on the pigs ass. Now she tilts her head to the sky and screams your name, not once, not twice, but three times. She slams her face full force into the pig's butthole and it's wreath of shitsemen pudding, her tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the pig's hot colon. Your mother works her tongue around the inside of the pigs ass, and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped her now brown lips, spurts of female ejaculate spurt from her pulsating cunt. Exhausted, she collapses in the mud, rolls over onto her back, and lights a cigarette. She takes one long drag, looks again to the sky, and speaks your name one last time before she drifts off to sleep.\n\nThat's your mom.

She gets down on her knees and crawls through the pigpiss mud slop and snuggles up to the pig, her fingers tracing along it's belly until she finds it's cock. She begins tugging and stroking as her twat moistens, her breasts swelling and her nipples begin to stick out like erasers on a fresh #2 pencil. She grunts with satisfaction as the pig begins eagerly thrusting into her hand, her grip now tightening to maintain control of the pig's greasy corkscrew cock. She lowers her head to watch the cock work in her hand, groans with satisfaction and begins working her clit with her other muddy hand, her hips gyrating with the rhythm of the pig's thrusting.\n\n\"Oh fucking jesus god yes..\" she gasps. She changes positions, still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the pig's squealing intensifies. She leans forward and with her lips almost touching the pig's ear, she whispers your name and begins to shudder. She turns her attention again to the pigs swollen member rocking in her hand. She presses it between her hand and her face, the pig thrusting it against her cheeks as she drools. With a massive grunt and a high pitched squeal, the pig's balls explode, beginning a massive shower of hot, sour pig jizz. You mother cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in her hand as the thrusting comes to an end. The pig shudders and begins to walk to the trough of slop in the corner of it's pen, but your mother tackles it to the ground. She lifts it's tail and smears the handful of pig load into the pig's own fetid butthole, turning flakes of crusty pig shit into a pigshit-pigjizz mud slop on the pigs ass. Now she tilts her head to the sky and screams your name, not once, not twice, but three times. She slams her face full force into the pig's butthole and it's wreath of shitsemen pudding, her tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the pig's hot colon. Your mother works her tongue around the inside of the pigs ass, and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped her now brown lips, spurts of female ejaculate spurt from her pulsating cunt. Exhausted, she collapses in the mud, rolls over onto her back, and lights a cigarette. She takes one long drag, looks again to the sky, and speaks your name one last time before she drifts off to sleep.\n\nThat's your mom.

She grunts with satisfaction as the pig begins eagerly thrusting into her hand, her grip now tightening to maintain control of the pig's greasy corkscrew cock. She lowers her head to watch the cock work in her hand, groans with satisfaction and begins working her clit with her other muddy hand, her hips gyrating with the rhythm of the pig's thrusting.\n\n\"Oh fucking jesus god yes..\" she gasps. She changes positions, still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the pig's squealing intensifies. She leans forward and with her lips almost touching the pig's ear, she whispers your name and begins to shudder. She turns her attention again to the pigs swollen member rocking in her hand. She presses it between her hand and her face, the pig thrusting it against her cheeks as she drools. With a massive grunt and a high pitched squeal, the pig's balls explode, beginning a massive shower of hot, sour pig jizz. You mother cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in her hand as the thrusting comes to an end. The pig shudders and begins to walk to the trough of slop in the corner of it's pen, but your mother tackles it to the ground. She lifts it's tail and smears the handful of pig load into the pig's own fetid butthole, turning flakes of crusty pig shit into a pigshit-pigjizz mud slop on the pigs ass. Now she tilts her head to the sky and screams your name, not once, not twice, but three times. She slams her face full force into the pig's butthole and it's wreath of shitsemen pudding, her tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the pig's hot colon. Your mother works her tongue around the inside of the pigs ass, and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped her now brown lips, spurts of female ejaculate spurt from her pulsating cunt. Exhausted, she collapses in the mud, rolls over onto her back, and lights a cigarette. She takes one long drag, looks again to the sky, and speaks your name one last time before she drifts off to sleep.\n\nThat's your mom.

I made a comment about how the women looked more like sacrifices rather that pledges because they were bound up and looked to be in distress.

Total mass, or total surface area.\n\nThe average penis mass is [160 grams](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/3mcc5y/question_how_much_does_the_average_dick_weigh/cvdu708). Male semen has the same density as water [1g/cm^3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20668505), so if the average testicle has a volume of 18cm^3, it is roughly 18 grams. I couldn't find the average weight for MtF traps, so if we consider the average trap to be an ex-manlet (5'7\") with a medium frame, the ideal average weight should be around [140 lbs](https://blog.personalcapital.com/investing/what-is-a-healthy-body-weight-for-males-and-females/) (average of 133 and 147). 140 lbs is 63502.9 grams. 168 of 63503 is roughly 0.2645 %.\n\nSo fucking a trap is still 99.7355% heterosexual if you're going by mass.\n\nIf we go by surface are (because that is what is visible to us, so that's why I'm not doing volume) and use the same measurements, the average penis has 188.5 square cm of surface area. Average surface area for women is [1.6 m squared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area) which is 16000 cm squared. 188.5 of 16000 is 1.178125%.\n\nSo jacking off to a trap is still 98.821875\t% hetero is you're going by SA.\n\nEdit: I did mass, because that is what you feel if you have sex.

Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.\n\nIn a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from.\n\nHopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially.\n\nBeatles' \"Aryan\" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.\n\nContemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to \"Beatlemania\", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon & McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as \"Tommy\" and \"Quadrophenia\"; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.\n\nThe Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented \"Beatlemania\" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading these pages about such a trivial band.\nExtended note from 2010. The Beatles were not a terribly interesting band, but their fans were and still are an interesting phenomenon. I can only name religious fundamentalists as annoying (and as threatening) as Beatles fans, and as persevering in sabotaging anyone who dares express an alternate opinion of their faith. They have turned me into some kind of Internet celebrity not because of the 6,000 bios that i have written, not because of the 800-page book that i published, not because of the 30 years of cultural events that i organized, but simply because i downplayed the artistic merits of the Beatles, an action that they consider as disgraceful as the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nJakub Krawczynski sent me this supportive comment in 2010:\nI find it quite amusing that almost all of the Beatles songs have their own entries on Wikipedia (nothing wrong with that in itself, actually), even if they are not singles, and each of them is meticulously dissected as if there were transcendental suites exceeding human comprehension, yet bands like Faust or Red Krayola, etc. have biographies even shorter than just one article about any random Beatles song. Needless to say, none of their songs have any articles on them, yet I'm sure there would be a lot more to talk about. Moreover, if you had put any bad review of their album on the site with the intention to show the broader scope of opinions, you'd risk your \"life\" there, since such fanatics don't accept any single sign of trying to be objective. You are seen as public enemy number 1 to them. It is like your article is one giant cognitive dissonance to them and vandalizing your bio was the only way to reduce this dissonance.\n(Italian text translated by Ornella C. Grannis and proof-edited by Daniel Vogel )\n\nThe Beatles most certainly belong to the history of the 60s, but their musical merits are at best dubious.\n\nThe Beatles came at the height of the reaction against rock and roll, when the innocuous \"teen idols\", rigorously white, were replacing the wild black rockers who had shocked the radio stations and the conscience of half of America. Their arrival represented a lifesaver for a white middle class terrorized by the idea that within rock and roll lay a true revolution of customs. The Beatles tranquilized that vast section of the population and conquered the hearts of all those (first and foremost the females) who wanted to rebel, without violating the social status quo. The contorted and lascivious faces of the black rock and rollers were substituted by the innocent smiles of the Beatles; the unleashed rhythms of the first were substituted by the catchy tunes of the latter. Rock and roll could finally be included in the pop charts. The Beatles represented the quintessential reaction to a musical revolution in the making, and for a few years they managed to run its enthusiasm into the ground.\n\nFurthermore, the Beatles represented the reaction against a social and political revolution. They arrived at the time of the student protests, of Bob Dylan, of the Hippies, and they replaced the image of angry kids, fists in the air, with their cordial faces and amiable declarations. They came to replace the accusatory words of militant musicians with overindulgent nursery rhymes. Thus the Beatles served as middle-class tranquilizers, as if to prove the new generation was not made up exclusively of rebels, misfits and sex maniacs.\n\nFor most of their career, the Beatles were four mediocre musicians who sang melodic three-minute tunes at a time when rock music was trying to push itself beyond that format, one originally confined by the technical limitations of the 78 rpm record. They were the quintessence of \"mainstream\" (assimilating the innovations proposed by rock music) within the format of the melodic song.\n\nThe Beatles belonged, like the Beach Boys (whom they emulated throughout most of their career), to the era of the vocal band. In such a band the technique of the instrument was not as important as that of the chorus. Undoubtedly skilled at composing choruses, they availed themselves of producer George Martin (head of Parlophone since 1956), to embellish those choruses with arrangements more and more eccentric.\n\nThanks to a careful marketing campaign, they became the most celebrated entertainers of the era, and are still the darlings of magazines and tabloids, much like Princess Grace of Monaco and Lady Di.\n\nThe convergence between Western polyphony (melody, several parts of vocal harmony and instrumental arrangements) and African percussion - the leitmotif of US music from its inception - was legitimized in Europe by the huge success of the Merseybeat, in particular by its best sellers, Gerry and the Pacemakers and the Beatles, both produced by George Martin and managed by Brian Epstein. To the bands of the Merseybeat goes the credit of having validated rock music for a vast, virtually endless, audience.

My friends were drinking at the time, but one of them was watching the event unfold and apparently it was brutal. They managed to seperate the crab and the eel in a very literal sense. Jr ripped one of the Mike's claws off and rushed back to his cove with his prize. They isolated Mike, but he died a few hours later.\n\nIt sucked at the time, because salt-water fish are fucking expensive, but we joke about it now and my friends took it as a learning experience. My friend managed to get a picture of jr the second before he attacked, but it's on an old sd card and he can't send it to me at the time I'm writing this out.

It goes from hearing all these stories to actually being a part of those stories and developing your own viewpoint of the person.  That isn't a male/female thing, nor is it a bitchy scumbag move, it's just the reality of relationships.\n\nMost people, men and women equally, do not hold the same viewpoint of themselves as you would.  It's just one of the standard hurdles all relationships need to get over.  These guys may, and that's a stretch, be taking things a little too far by only focusing on this change in women, but the reality is that they are men and it's a lot easier to see this effect in the women they date instead of inside themselves.

So it's not that men are any better, it's that women are able to get into a position to take advantage of someone like this a bit more easily, and there are enough low self esteem having men that will facilitate the cycle, and either finally kick the girl out and then blame all women without seeing his role, (ideally) work on himself and get a better class of partner, or end up getting worked over by the girl in the form of some sort false accusation by someone already comfortable playing the victim card.", "id": "d13gyna"}, {"comment": ">>saying this on /4chan/\n", "id": "d13gzlf"}, {"comment": "This is /r/4chan you big doofus.

A linked list is like storing the first dog in locker #27 next to a note that says \"next dog in locker #308.\" So you go to locker #308 and pull out a dog and a note that says \"next dog in locker #215.\" And it goes on and on until you have all the dogs. The list is made up of 'nodes', where each node is an element (dog/piece of data) plus the link (pointer) to the next node.\n\nThe other way to store dogs would be to find some part of the hallway with 10,000 empty lockers in a row, store all the dogs next to each other, and say \"the dog collection starts at locker #108 and goes on for 10,000 lockers, one dog per locker.\" This is obviously going to be a lot faster and saner for anyone accessing the dog collection, or if you know there will never be more than 10,000. It's also nice if someone wants to just find dog #3722 -- in the linked list,  you had to go through all the dogs in order, but now you can say \"if dog #1 is at locker #108 then dog #3722 is at locker #3829.\"\n\nBut if you're going to be constantly adding dogs then you'll be relocating to different empty parts of the hallway over and over again trying to find spaces that let you fit everyone. This is called a dynamic array. If you want to constantly add new dogs but don't need to access them rapidly or in random order, then a linked list might be better, because you never have to relocate the entire dog army.", "id": "cye858a"}, {"comment": "Who the fuck grows plants in a computer?! /s", "id": "cydztt4"}, {"comment": "eWeed man, it's the hip new drug all the kids a raving for!", "id": "cye0rz2"}, {"comment": "You wouldn't download a marijuana ", "id": "cye256o"}, {"comment": "This is your brain...
