I had severe acne for almost 13 years, and NOTHING helped. No products of any kind, no birth control pills, no antibiotics, no herbal/all natural remedies, Proactiv didn't work, Mary Kay products didn't work, dietary changes didn't work, nothing. Every pore I had was clogged. I tried covering it with makeup, but then people just constantly complained about how bad the makeup supposedly looked. I used only non-comedogenic products and completely washed it off every night before bed, but people *still* blamed the makeup, and had no problem letting me know that. You can't win. \n\nI finally found a doctor willing to put me on Accutane, and then my triglycerides skyrocketed, so they stopped the treatment. My skin reverted back to its usual awful state.\n\nSo then I lost my health insurance, but found a way to get *back* on the treatment. My triglycerides kept skyrocketing every month, though, so every month, I became more and more strict with what I ate. Eventually, I was eating nothing more than organic cereal with no milk, tomato soup, and 100% whole grain bread. I had to adhere to this diet during Halloween, Thanksgiving, *and*  Christmas. My triglycerides still went up, and my doctor stopped the treatment for 2 weeks. The doctor gave me Retin-A Micro to use so that I could keep my skin stable. During that 2-week break, my skin did stabilize, and my triglycerides went down just enough to let me finish the treatment.\n\nThat was back in 2010, and my skin has stayed clear. I have the occasional small pimple here and there and a few blackheads on my nose, and that's it. I get two or three hormonal pimples during some months, but that's just a normal thing for us girls. And they're never big and painful like they were. \n\nThe only thing I really deal with now is the scarring. When I *do* get the occasional pimple, it dries up in two days without any effort on my part. And no more greasy skin!

Gardner's plays with light and shadow are much more nuanced, and the focus he attains with those photos is amazing, given an exposure took several seconds.

Again, this measures UVB, not UVA (aging).

I live in Japan and wasn't given any information about decolonizing or how to prevent further infections, so I lived in constant fear of every pimple/bug bite turning into another infection. \n\n\nWhen I got the third infection, I was in Singapore. It was one of the worst yet, on my stomach, debilitatingly painful and the size of a baseball within 24 hours, and I was rushed into surgery. The next day at my follow up the doctor gave me a whole regimen to decolonize (mupirocin in the nose, chlorhexedine body wash), but he instructed me not to start until my current infection was completely healed. In the meantime, he suggested that I buy Manuka honey (medicinal grade from New Zealand) and apply it under a bandage if any new infections sprang up, as it's highly effective in killing resistant staph. \n\n\nI ended up getting two more infections that I caught while they were small (hot, red--obvious MRSA), and used hot compresses to bring them to a head. I applied the honey, and by the next day both times they were draining, and the pain and pressure was gone. Day two and the redness and warmth were gone, still draining, though no other signs of infections. By day five they were both healing like normal pimples, and now look just like tiny acne scars, as compared to the three nearly two-inch surgical scars I have from the first three infections.

She \"doesn't believe in\" antibiotics and has been treating it with powders from local healers, local herbs, and the equivalent to neosporine. \n\nLuckily, one of the people staying at the hostel was a nurse, and convinced her to at the very least clean the wounds, properly, and get as much of the infection out as possible.

If you're talking about Staph aureus +/- MRSA or other types, I am not sure that the assumption of colonization = higher risk holds true. I'm not sure how easy it would be to study if colonized, never-infected people are more likely to develop an infection than uncolonized never-infected people.  I do know that there are many colonized patients in the hospitals that never become clinically infected. We don't eradicate the disease but we do isolate the patients, and I believe there is at least some data supporting this process in order to prevent hospital and other care facility outbreaks. \n\n2. Resistance is rarely bred from scratch. These antibiotic resistance genes are known genes that are handed down the genetic line within the same species of bacteria or from species to species of bacteria. The likelihood of getting a bacteria to mutate on your own skin and develop antibiotic resistance compared to the likelihood of catching another resistant bug is very low.\n\n3. MRSA reinfection is probably more likely in those who have been infected or colonized.

I live in Japan and wasn't given any information about decolonizing or how to prevent further infections, so I lived in constant fear of every pimple/bug bite turning into another infection. \n\n\nWhen I got the third infection, I was in Singapore. It was one of the worst yet, on my stomach, debilitatingly painful and the size of a baseball within 24 hours, and I was rushed into surgery. The next day at my follow up the doctor gave me a whole regimen to decolonize (mupirocin in the nose, chlorhexedine body wash), but he instructed me not to start until my current infection was completely healed. In the meantime, he suggested that I buy Manuka honey (medicinal grade from New Zealand) and apply it under a bandage if any new infections sprang up, as it's highly effective in killing resistant staph. \n\n\nI ended up getting two more infections that I caught while they were small (hot, red--obvious MRSA), and used hot compresses to bring them to a head. I applied the honey, and by the next day both times they were draining, and the pain and pressure was gone. Day two and the redness and warmth were gone, still draining, though no other signs of infections. By day five they were both healing like normal pimples, and now look just like tiny acne scars, as compared to the three nearly two-inch surgical scars I have from the first three infections.

OP -ya face look good!", "id": "d45tv1r"}, {"comment": "What about the FAQ isn't helpful or do you want more information on?\n\nCeraVe moisturizers are popular because they contain a good amount of hyaluronic acid which is a humectant that helps to attract moisture and deliver it to deeper layers of your skin. [Here's a little article on it if you want to read more](http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/anti-aging/_/hyaluronic-acid-benefits-for-skin). They also contain ceramides which are helpful to reduce hyperpigmentation, from acne scarring or sun damage spots etc.\n\nThe face wash is mostly because it's gentle, not overly drying or fragranced. Purpose cleanser is a similar, cheaper (smaller bottle) alternative to the foaming cleanser. If the CeraVe products don't work well for you, Cetaphil products are very similar and also recommended here, though they're not as popular on this sub as CeraVe. \n\nThe general guidance of this sub is that acne is often a result of dehydration of the skin instead of oiliness so using non-stripping face wash and a good moisturizer is recommended. Also, using physical exfoliation with a brush or scrub is not recommended because it can cause tiny tears in the skin that bacteria can multiply in and lead to further skin issues. Instead, it's recommended to use a chemical exfoliator (BHA, AHA) such as the Stridex pads suggested in the beginner's routine.

I just wanted to offer a bit of unsolicited advice for the scarring:\n\nI have had a few surgeries now including having multiple moles removed from my face and body, both by GP's and plastic surgeons. One of the things I learned from the plastic surgeon who did the first one was to use moist healing whenever possible.\n\nI know how hard it is to get a damn bandage to stick to your face anyway, so here's what I do.\n\nSupplies:\n\n* [2nd skin moist burn pads](http://www.amazon.com/Spenco-Skin-Moist-Medium-25-Count/dp/B004UOTUGM/ref=pd_sim_121_6?ie=UTF8&dpID=41YAp2yvSQL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR120%2C160_&refRID=0KRKSXASW7MGS22J6FJE) - these are pricey but form a clear less noticeable barrier that stays moist. I changed bandages daily so buying a box for $35 was cheaper in the long run by far compared to buying 3 single pads for $7 - these are also available in small packs from walgreens.\n\n* [Tegraderm clear adhesive dressing](http://www.amazon.com/Nexcare-Tegaderm-Transparent-Dressing-Inches/dp/B000PQ5NM4/ref=pd_sim_194_7?ie=UTF8&dpID=41CYKxDpL8L&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR145%2C160_&refRID=1MC7HJRH0KH4BF659185) - This stuff is the holy grail of bandages, it sticks without irritating already irritated skin, it is flexible, invisible, and matte so you can put makeup over it. It does not leave a film or residue of any kind. It also comes in a long roll that you can cut to fit, which is what I did as it's cheaper.\n\n* [Skin prep](http://www.amazon.com/Skin-Prep-Protection-Dressing-Wipes-Box/dp/B000S9KLSY/ref=pd_sim_194_2?ie=UTF8&dpID=412nG4z45dL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&refRID=0K8VPKM9DJEC8XD6FF9S) - This stuff makes bandages STICK. I use it on my little girl before putting a bandaid on because she will peel the damn thing off two seconds later. This stuff is amazing! You swab it on before applying a bandage and presto! No peeling, even in water. It also protects the skin from damage and cleans wounds gently.\n\n* Small sterile scissors (wipe down with rubbing alcohol)\n\n* sterile tweezers\n\n* a clean paper towel to lay everything on\n\nThe procedure: After cleansing with a gentle cleanser, but BEFORE moisturizing, wash your hands. Cut a small square to fit your wound site from the 2nd skin. This only needs to cover the actual broken skin, but will really help the crusty build up if you decide to cover the whole thing.\n\nCut a square slightly larger of the tegraderm and round the corners to prevent peeling. You want 1/4-1/2 inch overhang for the tegraderm to adhere properly. Get a skin prep wipe out and tear open package. Don't get any on your fingers, this stuff is sticky.\n\nPeel the blue plastic layer of the 2nd skin and place it on your wound, then using tweezers and your fingers gently peel the clear plastic film from the top. You should be left with a really soothing nice little clear patch of gel - don't worry if you mess this up, the smaller the wound the more fiddly it is at first.\n\nNext, using your tweezers, remove the prep site pad from its foil and swab gently all around the edges of the 2nd skin, covering the whole area that the tegraderm will be covering. Set that aside.\n\nNext, grab your tegraderm. Like the skin prep, this stuff has two layers, there will be a paper liner on one side, the clear film itself in between, and a paper \"ring\" around the outside to help you with application. Peel the paper liner from that side, exposing the adhesive, and place over your wound, completely covering the 2nd skin. Do not stretch it as you apply, and press gently all around the edges to ensure a good seal. Gently peel the leftover paper ring from the outer edge, and you are done.\n\nYou can safely leave this bandage on for a week or more, but you'll probably find if you're wearing makeup that it will start to peel by the end of the day. You can gently apply lotion to your face, and then concealer and makeup over the whole bandage. \n\nSorry this got long, before I shut up and return to my hole: Some [pictures/anecdotal evidence](http://imgur.com/a/l9ZKb). I had two similarly sized moles removed by a GP, not a plastic surgeon. I used the above method on the one cut out of my face, from the moment I got home with the stitches still in, and left the other mole to heal on its own following the GP's directions of keep dry and covered til stitches removed. (Bandage changes this complicated would have been impossible by myself as that mole was on my shoulder blade.) As you can see the one on my face is nearly invisible, while the one on my shoulder blade puffed up nicely and remains discolored.\n\nI hope this helps!"], [11, "[deleted]"], [9, "[deleted]"], [4, "I am so sorry that you have to deal with this.

I mean, she's posting pictures of a huge-ass cyst and talking about how *painful* it is... I think she's well aware about her case of cystic acne.\n\nSecond, you're saying \"go to a different doctor\" like this girl isn't going to every doctor she can already (she's been to quiet a few from her descriptions and is currently waiting on a new appointment with another specialist). It sounds like she's working within the NHS, which can be a bit slow when referring people to specialists, and it's a little more complex than just hopping over to the next doc in a day. Even in private systems, derm appointments take months to get... and she's not in that kind of system. Within this context, just saying \"go to a different derm\" displays a lack of understanding of her situation and is pretty unhelpful.\n\nAnd finally, telling her \"get cortisone and accutane\" *as if that just is the answer to every situation ever* - which it's not - comes off as a bit presumptuous. It sounds like they're evaluating her for a surgical extraction, and there are probably reasons they're looking at that over accutane. Especially given that this cyst seems like a lone monster that's invaded her face in the absence of any other current issues, i wouldn't be surprised if they were worried it's some sort of cellular abnormality.\n\nI realize you're trying to be blunt and push her towards what you see as a more productive solution, but it comes off as rather callous and presumptuous.

I just wanted to offer a bit of unsolicited advice for the scarring:\n\nI have had a few surgeries now including having multiple moles removed from my face and body, both by GP's and plastic surgeons. One of the things I learned from the plastic surgeon who did the first one was to use moist healing whenever possible.\n\nI know how hard it is to get a damn bandage to stick to your face anyway, so here's what I do.\n\nSupplies:\n\n* [2nd skin moist burn pads](http://www.amazon.com/Spenco-Skin-Moist-Medium-25-Count/dp/B004UOTUGM/ref=pd_sim_121_6?ie=UTF8&dpID=41YAp2yvSQL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR120%2C160_&refRID=0KRKSXASW7MGS22J6FJE) - these are pricey but form a clear less noticeable barrier that stays moist. I changed bandages daily so buying a box for $35 was cheaper in the long run by far compared to buying 3 single pads for $7 - these are also available in small packs from walgreens.\n\n* [Tegraderm clear adhesive dressing](http://www.amazon.com/Nexcare-Tegaderm-Transparent-Dressing-Inches/dp/B000PQ5NM4/ref=pd_sim_194_7?ie=UTF8&dpID=41CYKxDpL8L&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR145%2C160_&refRID=1MC7HJRH0KH4BF659185) - This stuff is the holy grail of bandages, it sticks without irritating already irritated skin, it is flexible, invisible, and matte so you can put makeup over it. It does not leave a film or residue of any kind. It also comes in a long roll that you can cut to fit, which is what I did as it's cheaper.\n\n* [Skin prep](http://www.amazon.com/Skin-Prep-Protection-Dressing-Wipes-Box/dp/B000S9KLSY/ref=pd_sim_194_2?ie=UTF8&dpID=412nG4z45dL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR160%2C160_&refRID=0K8VPKM9DJEC8XD6FF9S) - This stuff makes bandages STICK. I use it on my little girl before putting a bandaid on because she will peel the damn thing off two seconds later. This stuff is amazing! You swab it on before applying a bandage and presto! No peeling, even in water. It also protects the skin from damage and cleans wounds gently.\n\n* Small sterile scissors (wipe down with rubbing alcohol)\n\n* sterile tweezers\n\n* a clean paper towel to lay everything on\n\nThe procedure: After cleansing with a gentle cleanser, but BEFORE moisturizing, wash your hands. Cut a small square to fit your wound site from the 2nd skin. This only needs to cover the actual broken skin, but will really help the crusty build up if you decide to cover the whole thing.\n\nCut a square slightly larger of the tegraderm and round the corners to prevent peeling. You want 1/4-1/2 inch overhang for the tegraderm to adhere properly. Get a skin prep wipe out and tear open package. Don't get any on your fingers, this stuff is sticky.\n\nPeel the blue plastic layer of the 2nd skin and place it on your wound, then using tweezers and your fingers gently peel the clear plastic film from the top. You should be left with a really soothing nice little clear patch of gel - don't worry if you mess this up, the smaller the wound the more fiddly it is at first.\n\nNext, using your tweezers, remove the prep site pad from its foil and swab gently all around the edges of the 2nd skin, covering the whole area that the tegraderm will be covering. Set that aside.\n\nNext, grab your tegraderm. Like the skin prep, this stuff has two layers, there will be a paper liner on one side, the clear film itself in between, and a paper \"ring\" around the outside to help you with application. Peel the paper liner from that side, exposing the adhesive, and place over your wound, completely covering the 2nd skin. Do not stretch it as you apply, and press gently all around the edges to ensure a good seal. Gently peel the leftover paper ring from the outer edge, and you are done.\n\nYou can safely leave this bandage on for a week or more, but you'll probably find if you're wearing makeup that it will start to peel by the end of the day. You can gently apply lotion to your face, and then concealer and makeup over the whole bandage. \n\nSorry this got long, before I shut up and return to my hole: Some [pictures/anecdotal evidence](http://imgur.com/a/l9ZKb). I had two similarly sized moles removed by a GP, not a plastic surgeon. I used the above method on the one cut out of my face, from the moment I got home with the stitches still in, and left the other mole to heal on its own following the GP's directions of keep dry and covered til stitches removed. (Bandage changes this complicated would have been impossible by myself as that mole was on my shoulder blade.) As you can see the one on my face is nearly invisible, while the one on my shoulder blade puffed up nicely and remains discolored.\n\nI hope this helps!", "id": "cyqcy4i"}], [{"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cypt2jp"}, {"comment": "Thank you.

Taking antibiotics for a prolonged amount of time increases exposure (as you'd hope) but at some point the desirable side-effects are outweighed by the bad / undesirable. \n\nIt might also be fair to say that if a single course hasn't proved effective it might be worth trying a more aggressive xor more selective / targeting antibiotic ... that repeating the ineffective course is not in your interest ... but this is not nearly the same as 'more than once *a year* is 'bad''\n\nMore aggressive / selective will have stronger side-effects (this is the basis of all medicine)\n\nMany people are perpetually on antibiotics - it's not ideal - but if the risk outweighs the reward, it's a good bargain. The undesirable side-effects can be mitigated (encouraging gut flora by eating yoghurt, for instance)\n\n> because the bad bacteria you're fighting off becomes resistant\n\nThis isn't true.

Every other boy had conked out, but I was throbbing with an urge to visit the sink in the corner, very close to the bed of one unfortunate, but soundly sleeping fellow teenager. It was three or four am, I'd been patient. This had to be a covert mission.\n\nEver since my arrival at camp, a tantalising lump began to loom in my right temple. The thought of this magnificently untimely, unexploded bomb buried in my face was driving me up the wall, and this night was the Blitzkrieg.\n\nI went into it hands-only. There was no sterile needle, no washbag full of skincare remedies and mere moonlight to squint by. Nonetheless, what light there was threw my Goliath into sharp relief. Fingers at my temple, I inspected the cyst. How deep and voluminous was it? Was it a hardened blockage or a pregnant sac? Yes, there was a hint of compliance. But the skin was unbroken, and it yielded only so far. My temple was flaming, already painful. I knew what I was about to do would be totally unveiled come the morning. I knew as I started squeezing I was making a terrible mistake, but turning away now was unthinkable.\n\nHarder and harder I forced my fingertips, until the edges of my nails left marks. Blood bloomed under the surface, my whole temple throbbed but I did not relent. The ultimate, revolting satisfaction would be mine. Over the course of minutes, the skin weakened, I could sense the end was near. I paused briefly to check I alone was awake; No movement. Feet to my right, a sleeping face shone in the darkness. Turning back to the mirror, I squeezed as hard as I could, impatient, grunting, angry at the pain. In one seething explosion, a fusillade of pus assaulted the glass and I knew, in my euphoria, the spatter on the mirror was not the full extent of the eruption. I had sensed something shocking, an epic pop, a buckshot of pus. I stared at my ruined face, fear suddenly overcoming disgust. My temple still sticky I turned to my right, peering into the darkness in the direction of the nearest bed. Shit shit shit with a capital Shit. I edged closer, barely breathing, praying I was mistaken. Upon his blameless visage had alighted something mucilaginous, and there was more on his ear and his neck... satellite spatter. I had a choice at this point. I could use some bog roll to daub at the collateral damage or I could retreat from this poor bespattered bastard and accept he was beyond my help.\n\nI returned, agonized, to the sink. A clutch of blood-spotted tissues to my head, I wiped the mirror, polished away the smears as best I could, crossed the dormitory and slinked into bed. I looked over the rows of beds towards the boy with whom I now shared a secret bond. As I lay there contemplating this latest causal chain of events plaguing what should have been much needed sack time, the satisfaction of the pop bloomed vividly in my mind. What a pop. What a night.

I stopped and rested my fingers, and went at it again until I got all of it out. Finally the hard spot on my cheek went away, but you can barely see the pore that it came out of. Sometimes it gets dirty and I have to squeeze some out, but the pore is open so it's easy now. \nTl;dr pimple got infected, became a hard spot and couldn't pop it.

Every other boy had conked out, but I was throbbing with an urge to visit the sink in the corner, very close to the bed of one unfortunate, but soundly sleeping fellow teenager. It was three or four am, I'd been patient. This had to be a covert mission.\n\nEver since my arrival at camp, a tantalising lump began to loom in my right temple. The thought of this magnificently untimely, unexploded bomb buried in my face was driving me up the wall, and this night was the Blitzkrieg.\n\nI went into it hands-only. There was no sterile needle, no washbag full of skincare remedies and mere moonlight to squint by. Nonetheless, what light there was threw my Goliath into sharp relief. Fingers at my temple, I inspected the cyst. How deep and voluminous was it? Was it a hardened blockage or a pregnant sac? Yes, there was a hint of compliance. But the skin was unbroken, and it yielded only so far. My temple was flaming, already painful. I knew what I was about to do would be totally unveiled come the morning. I knew as I started squeezing I was making a terrible mistake, but turning away now was unthinkable.\n\nHarder and harder I forced my fingertips, until the edges of my nails left marks. Blood bloomed under the surface, my whole temple throbbed but I did not relent. The ultimate, revolting satisfaction would be mine. Over the course of minutes, the skin weakened, I could sense the end was near. I paused briefly to check I alone was awake; No movement. Feet to my right, a sleeping face shone in the darkness. Turning back to the mirror, I squeezed as hard as I could, impatient, grunting, angry at the pain. In one seething explosion, a fusillade of pus assaulted the glass and I knew, in my euphoria, the spatter on the mirror was not the full extent of the eruption. I had sensed something shocking, an epic pop, a buckshot of pus. I stared at my ruined face, fear suddenly overcoming disgust. My temple still sticky I turned to my right, peering into the darkness in the direction of the nearest bed. Shit shit shit with a capital Shit. I edged closer, barely breathing, praying I was mistaken. Upon his blameless visage had alighted something mucilaginous, and there was more on his ear and his neck... satellite spatter. I had a choice at this point. I could use some bog roll to daub at the collateral damage or I could retreat from this poor bespattered bastard and accept he was beyond my help.\n\nI returned, agonized, to the sink. A clutch of blood-spotted tissues to my head, I wiped the mirror, polished away the smears as best I could, crossed the dormitory and slinked into bed. I looked over the rows of beds towards the boy with whom I now shared a secret bond. As I lay there contemplating this latest causal chain of events plaguing what should have been much needed sack time, the satisfaction of the pop bloomed vividly in my mind. What a pop. What a night.

Low self esteem, low confidence, my sisters - seniors at the time - had to drag me to come to the cafeteria to eat.\n\nThe following year I transferred to a school close to home and started seeing a dermatologist. I had more support here from family and close friends from highschool. I got on a regimen of bactrim and a strong psoriasis drug, soriatane. It worked.\n\nNow I'm on just bactrim, washing and massaging my face for a minute twice a day with Lever 2000 soap, moisturizing with CeraVe. 1000mg of Vitamin C a day. Very rarely do I get breakouts unless I'm being irresponsible.\n\nAcne sucks, but it also taught me a lot about myself. The picture on the right is current, and I thank my family and friends every day for helping me through it.\n\nEdit: Also sorry about the instagram filter, I had buzzed my topknot off and it was a pic I took of that because I was lazy to take a new one ._.", "id": "d5zftyk"}, {"comment": "I have a few friends who had roughly the same sort of cystic acne, except unlike you they didn't do anything about it.

I was on accutane 5 times for 5 months each across a period of 5 years (from 12-17 years old) Starting at a normal dose, hitting my max dose for a few rounds, and my last time going to below my minimum dose because my parents and doctor had to force me on it from the hate I had grown for the medicine. (For context, I was about 220 pounds, min dose was 40 units ((MG? IU? I can't remember)) meaning two pills, max was 100, so five pills.)\n\nEach time, I could just feel it starting a few weeks in. I'm usually an extremely laid back guy for context. Kind of an asshole in some respects, but far from mean or negative, or at least I like to think so.\n\nAccutane gave new emotions to me. I would feel pure, unadulterated anger for no reason whatsoever at the smallest things while I was on it. It led to me screaming at a girlfriend once- the only time before or since I've ever done so. It's scary. After getting angry, about 10-15 minutes later I'd just get sad. Really, really sad. I wouldn't understand why I was so angry and it brought me down. Even once I understood what was causing it, It didn't help. Then I'd go back to a normal, sedentary, repressive and depressive state where I just didn't give a shit about much of anything. That was my normal emotion while on it.\n\nThen what it did to my appearance would hurt me more on the inside. My entire face would peel off in pieces and I'd constantly have dead skin everywhere. My lips would go beyond chapped to the point of scarred up and bleeding. I tried moisturizer, I tried aquaphor, I took an ungodly amount of vitamin E as recommended- nothing helped. Being a kid in his teenage years of course just made it that much worse for me.\n\nI remember just always feeling so much happiness when I came off of it each round. My moods would stabilize to my normal, boring self. I could relax. My appetite would return. I could go into the sun for more than a few hours without turning into Larry the Lobster. I could see at night again. I could eat a hotdog without the sores at the sides of my mouth ripping back open and bleeding again, as well as the big split in the center of my bottom lip.\n\nAnd all of this is without even touching on how it fucked up my liver. I count myself extremely lucky to not have IBS. I sometimes wonder if I have some smaller form of it, but I don't know enough about it to know if that's even a thing that can happen or I'm just paranoid.\n\nWhat it did do, however, is clear the horrible horrible nodular acne I had. It saved me from a massive amount of scarring. When I started Accutane, the acne was just starting to move from my arms and back to my face. I remember one particular notable moment when my mom just lightly laid her hand on my back and I winced from pain- that shit hurt. A lot. I've still got a ton of scars on my arms and some on my back, but my face is pretty clear of them.\n\nI also still get the occasional nodular zit and have regular light acne, but it's just nowhere near what it once was. Accutane saved me from a lot, but it came at a cost.\n\nIt's a worthy drug if you truly need it, but that's why I always pop in these threads when I happen to notice someone mention it.

And i'm in shorts, and longsleeve T and the shirt they gave me that I put on for warmth. The second thing I noticed is that its a 3 lap 5k, meaning that one daunting hill in the beginning is actually *3* hills.\n\nI ran with my dad, who was 48 when this happened. He also has *2* bad knees. I knew if I lost I would literally never hear the end of it. So when the whistle first blew, he fucking *ran* faster than I've ever seen him run. I mean, he was in the fucking *front* of a 5K with competitive runners. So I sprinted. In the confusion however I failed to note that my dad had actually fallen behind me, so I'm running like my life depends on it not realizing. So I get about a 1/3 of the way to the end and I can't go any further. There are cute girls holding the sign posts for the direction and while that initially made me work hard I just couldn't go. So I started talking to this kid who was like 8 and we ran together. He was motivated to beat his sister who was an actual high school runner. So we beat her for most of the way but then there was a hill and I'm like \"FUCK\". So she passed us. BUT, a large group of people in my class(a bunch of like 18-25 year olds) thought they could beat me and the kid by kind of dogging it up the hill and then passing us on the day down and I just turned to the kid and basically said \"fuck them\" and we *ran* up the hill on the last leg. The las 10% was down hill and we just kept going. And thats how I thought I gave myself permanent lung damage.\n\n\nSo anyway they have a podium and the local news guy was there. So I'm getting into my car with my family and I said \"you know, I think I did pretty well\" and he kind of laughs and then they announce for me to come to the podium.\n\nSo, yes, it was a ton of fun.\n\nThat being said: WATER!

I just used a slightly more abrasive exfoliating pad with my regular body wash vs. just my loofa. \n2. Leaving at least 2 days (if not more) in between shaving.\n3. Using Aveeno shave cream. I'm not sure what kind you use, but those fruity/flowery ones definitely made my skin more irritated while shaving. Aveeno has really helped that (or probably any other less fragranced shave cream would work).\n4. Keeping my razors fresh (I used to use them far past when they should've been, to save money. But I think when you have skin sensitive to shaving it is just a necessity to make sure they aren't dull at all).\n\nThis helped me A LOT.

Such a great look, pale skin and red dots."], [18, "I've had \"strawberry skin\" for years, and as I've aged my sensitivity, (and therefore strawberry skin), has increased. However, when I started my current shaving routine, I saw a noticeable difference within a couple of weeks. Here's what I do. (I'll try to be as detailed as possible):\n- I exfoliate with body wash using an exfoliation glove, (I get mine at Target). Use whatever body wash agrees with your skin, whether it be a sensitive formula, fragrance free, or otherwise. Just be careful not to over-exfoliate, this may irritate your skin even more. \n- After rinsing off the soap, I cover the skin in a healthy layer of fragrance free baby oil. (I use Target brand.) This softens your hairs and highly reduces the amount of friction from the razor. I usually let the baby oil sit on the skin for a couple minutes before shaving to allow it to really soften up the hairs. \n- Once I'm ready to go at it with the razor, I add a layer of Aveeno oatmeal shaving cream over the top of baby oil. Some may think this is overkill, but I think the key to shaving sensitive skin and controlling strawberry skin is to reduce the amount of friction caused by dragging the blades over the skin. I've found this cream to work best for this, plus it has a minimal amount of skin-irritating ingredients. However, as long as the shaving cream is moisturizing and has minimal fragrance, use whatever you like.  \n- The next step is the part we all know: shave! The baby oil tends to gunk up the blades a bit faster than soap or shaving cream does, so just be sure to rinse off the head of the razor between strokes more often than you may be used to. Also, it's important to note that THE RAZOR THAT YOU USE MATTERS. The type and brand you use can make or break the whole process. In my opinion, disposable razors are worthless. Venus brand razors always feel like they're dragging instead of gliding across my skin no matter how much I lather on the oil/cream, and they irritate it. I use the Schick Quattro, it's the best I've found so far. But do your own experiments by buying and trying different razors, it's the only way to find out which one is best for you. Whatever razor you do choose, be sure to replace the blades frequently, and clean them well after each use, (I give them a short soak in rubbing alcohol or witch hazel).\n- After you step out of the shower, PAT DRY the skin that's just been shaved. Rubbing it with a towel can cause unnecessary and easily avoided irritation. Remember, friction is the enemy!\n- On dry skin, apply witch hazel, (I use Dickensen's), to the shaved area with a cotton ball or wash cloth. You can either dab it on or rub it on gently, but if you do rub it on, do it in the direction in which your hairs grow. Witch hazel helps to minimize the appearance and inflammation of the hair follicles, and can also help to prevent potential ingrown hairs. It may sting a bit, but it's an important step. \n- Once the witch hazel has dried, apply a moisturizing, sensitive skin-friendly lotion. I have found Amlactin to work the best. Tend Skin is a good alternative though. But again, with any of the products I've mentioned here, I recommend experimenting and finding what works for you.\n- If possible, avoid wearing tight clothing for 8-12 hours after shaving. Your skin has just been through the ringer and you want to give it time to breathe. Having tight clothing constantly rubbing against your freshly-shaven skin can disturb your recovering follicles and cause ingrown hairs. \nAlthough my bumps and strawberry skin aren't completely gone, this routine has been the most effective for me by far. I hope this helps to at least get you started in the right direction!"], [13, "> I'm sorry to hear about your desperation, I have had it as well. I went for years without shaving for fear of worsening KP. Would only wear long jeans for that time. Best advice I could give you is to find a good dermatologist and get laser removal if it's affecting the legs or a skin part with body hair.\nKP can be lessened and/or controlled. My whole family suffers from this. What I've learned from various sources that you can look up yourself is:\n\n>1) KP skin cannot shed cells normally. I've read that the skin might be stickier on people with KP which has dead cells stick more often. KP skin because it doesn't shed normally, tends to be dry.\n\n>2) KP can be worsened by environmental factors such as: humidity, type of clothing, temperature, water, and anything that it can come in contact with.\n\n>3) To lessen the effect of enviromental factors, use loose fitting clothing over the affected area. Use a shower filter as chlorine in water worsens KP. If you shave, use an electric foil razor as it's the least irritating method.\n\n>4) KP can be worsened by comedogenic products.\n\n>5) KP can be lessened by exfoliating chemically and/or physically. I use both. Scrub the affected parts(with a natural sponge) during the shower with a mild soap bar (I use dove, I don't know what would actually work better than dove and my dermatologist recommended it). You can also use an acne wash or bar soap for the affected areas but it's too irritating for me so I do it once or twice a week.\n\n>6) After showering and shaving my routine is Witch Hazel(preps skin and lessens irritation) -> AHA (salic. acid/I use the clinique one mentioned above)-> non-comedogenic lotion. I use Marc Anthony's coconut oil dry lotion.

However, when I started my current shaving routine, I saw a noticeable difference within a couple of weeks. Here's what I do. (I'll try to be as detailed as possible):\n- I exfoliate with body wash using an exfoliation glove, (I get mine at Target). Use whatever body wash agrees with your skin, whether it be a sensitive formula, fragrance free, or otherwise. Just be careful not to over-exfoliate, this may irritate your skin even more. \n- After rinsing off the soap, I cover the skin in a healthy layer of fragrance free baby oil. (I use Target brand.) This softens your hairs and highly reduces the amount of friction from the razor. I usually let the baby oil sit on the skin for a couple minutes before shaving to allow it to really soften up the hairs. \n- Once I'm ready to go at it with the razor, I add a layer of Aveeno oatmeal shaving cream over the top of baby oil. Some may think this is overkill, but I think the key to shaving sensitive skin and controlling strawberry skin is to reduce the amount of friction caused by dragging the blades over the skin. I've found this cream to work best for this, plus it has a minimal amount of skin-irritating ingredients. However, as long as the shaving cream is moisturizing and has minimal fragrance, use whatever you like.  \n- The next step is the part we all know: shave!

I'll explain some more why your experiment might not directly translate to this situation. \n\nFirst, the skin is not made of yeast and evolved as a barrier of protection (as well as an absorbent of vitamins) from the sun. So it's hard to compare.\n\nNext - SPF protects against **UVB** *only.* UVB is what gives you a sunburn. UVB doesn't penetrate deep into the skin. Also, increasing SPF is not linear: 30 is not double 15 (maybe your experiment showed this effect too?). Here's a quote that explains it well: \"an SPF 15 product blocks about 94% of UVB rays; an SPF 30 product blocks 97% of UVB rays; and an SPF 45 product blocks about 98% of rays.\"\n\n\n**UVA** is what penetrates deep and causes melanoma. Other things in sunscreen may protect against this, but you have to check the label because companies tend to be bad at making this clear. Broad spectrum means both. So SPF technically does not have too much to do with the scary DNA damage that results in cancer.\n\n\nFinally, as far as I know, no product protect against **UVC** because that is usually filtered out by the ozone layer. The ozone layer does have a hole in it though. I'm sure there's research on this, but I wouldn't be surprised if UVC has been entering our atmosphere.\n\n\nHere's an [infographic](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/72/05/b3/7205b3d8b5305ec0e270490de8c9a95c.png) to show you want to look for in a sunscreen.", "id": "cza65d0"}, {"comment": "When will you be done with the course? \n\nI too started in September with 50mg/day and will be done either late March or early April!

So essentially, tann**ed** skin is damaged skin. Damaged skin (and DNA) is not beautiful long term.\n- Most makeup products get designed with pale or rosy skin in mind (foundation, blush, lip color). People with a wheatish/golden complexion have some options now and then but once You go darker it can be near impossible and really frustrating. The few brands that cater to dark skin tones either have a single shade option to emcompass all the \"medium-to-dark skin tone spectrum\" or they have many options but their products are much more expensive, so either way You get screwed.\n- Exfoliation and Vit C are a common step in most beauty routines.

I have tried and realized you cannot treat hormonal acne unless you go to the source, therefore that was my deciding factor in stopping BC all together. And just an FYI, since you are experimenting right now, there are other more natural birth control methods besides a pill. I just started the \"Fertility Awareness Method,\" which basically you just monitor your body's signs to know when exactly you are fertile. The signs are: tracking temperature, checking cervical fluid, and tracking cervical position (this one is optional) daily. I recommend the book \"Taking Charge of your Fertility\" by Toni Weschler to further elaborate on the proper ways of this. But i've been doing it for three weeks and I cannot tell you how awesome it is to not be taking a pill [that induces acne].

Apply conditioner to hair below my ears (not on scalp), and, once a week, lightly to the exterior layer of hair on top of my head (I don't work it in), since I don't want it on my scalp too much. Rinse out after 3-7 minutes.\n\n3. Lightly towel dry hair.\n\n4. If it's a weekday, dry hair with hair dryer on medium heat. On the weekend, I lightly dry the hair near my scalp and let the rest air dry. Air drying produces by far the best results.\n\nThe result is that my hair is amazingly smooth and soft, doesn't get oily, and is less prone to getting split ends from abuse.

I have started from retinol, and moisturizer, than i have added some AHA and BHA.\n\nMy current routine checklist looks that:\n\nMorning:\n\nWash my face using regular body shampo (it's antiallergic, soft shampo), some times i use face scrub. Then i apply moisturizer, it's cheap product, it cost 25pln which is about 5 usd. http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vH365uhATBY/ViJRWR59t4I/AAAAAAAB0RI/Ogw_DAu5088/s640/hydrain3hialuro.png\n\nEvening: \n\nThere is 2 options. First one is when i training (running or gym). After a shower i apply AHA and BHA, than just before bed i wash my face with scrub, and then apply retinol. Second one is when i don't have a training, and i just have a shower before bed, then i apply only retinol.\n\nI use this product:\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7RbXyWAYnkY/TmXY7b2kwyI/AAAAAAAAHrA/Lzx5sLBtjMk/s1600/atqabeauty.blogspot.com+pharmaceris+sebo-almond+peel+01.JPG\n\nBHA \"viviene\" (there is no website, so i guess it's local product)\n\nand retinol is triacneal \n\nhttp://static.wizaz.pl/resize/var/ezdemo_site/storage/images/pielegnacja/emulsja-triacneal-expert-avene-na-tradzik-i-zmarszczki/87883-1-pol-PL/Emulsja-TriAcneal-EXPERT-Avene-na-tradzik-i-zmarszczki.jpg\n", "id": "d1bl78r"}, {"comment": "You really should be using sunscreen if you're using an AHA.

An SPF of 100 only indicates roughly 1 % more blocked sun than SPF50 (99 % vs. 98 %) - which is why many countries only allow ratings of SPF50+ because higher SPF ratings risk misleading consumers to believing they have \"twice the protection\" with SPF100 vs. in reality negligible increases of protection. Especially consumers buying a high SPF sunscreen and applying less is risky, as using say half the amount of SPF100 vs. SPF50 would mean much less protection with SPF100 only giving you 1 % more in the first place.\n\nNot intending to be a spoilsport - if an SPF100 sunscreen works for you that's fantastic, yay, continue enjoying it! - but rather just hoping to remind people that **applying enough sunscreen and reapplying it often is the best guarantee to appropriate sun protection**.", "id": "d5nqwvt"}, {"comment": "Came here to say this.

Most people in this sub had already given up microbeads (for one reason or another). I like to think they recycle their plastic bottles.

There are a lot of other steps involved in actually getting these products of the shelves.  It's not like the government can just send cops into stores and seize all of the microbread products.  And making companies stop producing them suddenly would have a terrible effect on the economy.  It has to be done in a series of steps that, unfortunately, occur over several months.  Writing it off as \"tl; dr: Capitalism!\" is missing some pretty huge parts of the problem.\n\nAnd expecting individuals to do the right thing if educated just isn't true.  Even when plastics are \"recycled\" (quotes because they don't always get recycled.  They're sometimes burned for energy), it takes a horrible toll on the environment, as shown in [this](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/16/plastic-poverty-pollution-china-recycling-dead-zone) article.  Please look at the picture of the Chinese waterways, which is what recycling plastic has done.  Recycling isn't a viable solution at all.  Eliminating plastic use, especially unneeded plastic use, is the only real solution and that's not happening. \n\nI understand where you're coming from and it would be nice to think people did the right thing in their own, but they're not.  I'm not.  I know that plastic production uses 4% of the world's oil, that plastic can be ingested by marine animals and cause injury or death, that floating plastic helps invasive species travel, and that plastic in landfills can leech into ground water [source](http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/ehs/news/dangers-of-plastic), but I'm still going to keep buying plastic bottles of SA because it gets rid of my sebaceous filaments, which is horribly vain and shallow, but easy to  write off because other people use waaay more plastic than me do my changes would be meaningless, right?\n\nI understand your frustration and microbeads have damaged the ecosystem, but it's not like the battle to ban them was evil big companies vs awesome, environmentally aware individuals.  Individuals oppose this ban.  And the one of plastic water bottles in National Parks and attempts in various areas to ban plastic grocery bags, etc.  I don't like microbeads.  I haven't used them in years and I think they should have been banned ages ago and I wish the ban could be implemented more quickly.  But the answer to \"Why does it take so long to implement the ban?\" isn't \"Because capitalism.\"  And corporations don't get all the a blame for the environment being the way it is now.  Almost all of us (except for the people who competely eschew plastic and produce virtually no waste) are adding to the problem with our own choices.  \n\nAnd interestingly enough, if it were true that indivual are good and make the right choice when they know the facts, then there wouldn't be any plastic because the demand for it would dry up.\n\nAnd sorry for the rantiness.  It wasn't specifically aimed at you.  It's just that the combination of a new year, when I get all fired up about being more green, and the marine conservation twitters I've started following have kind of kicked my tree hugging side into overdrive.  Seriously, *this* will be the year that I save the whales, just so other countries can kill them \"for science.\"  \n\nBut at least the ban is a step forward.  I really shouldn't be minimizing that.

However, the stigma surrounding isotretinoin and its potential increased risk of depression and suicide (which if it truly exists is not a very large increase in risk) has a negative effect in deterring patients from using it, which is probably a much more significant harm overall. The reluctance of dermatologists to prescribe isotretinoin in patients with depression stemming from social withdrawal and negative body image regarding severe acne etc is particularly counter-productive and needs to be re-evaluated.

Sometimes they chapped so badly they bled, even in public. My nickname while I was taking Accutane was Chappy.\n\nAlso had some incredibly fucked up dreams while taking it. Had apocalyptic visions nightly. They felt like years. I would wake up and remember whole days worth of events occurring \u2013 a blood-red sky, standing on the beach with a completely still tsunami that stretched from the ground to far above where the eye could see. Even now, years and years after it, I could still fill an entire journal with the detail of one dream in particular. They were exhausting and confusing.\n\nBut the results were unlike anything else. No previous medication had done anything to my acne. I really mean that. Benzaclin just changed the severity of my acne for the first few months, and then I bounced back. Accutane was, after about 3 months, like a nuke. I couldn't even believe it. My acne just started clearing up for the first time ever.

I've had every insult & shaming comment hurled my way, and attempted to gain friends in ways that makes older me cringe. After several visits to dermatologists and creams over the course of half a year later, Accutane was presented to my parents as the best option. The dermatologist explained some of the side effects, I didn't care, I wanted to stop being pizzaface.\n\nA couple of months in I started noticing side-effects. My lips couldn't go half a day without chap-stick. I forgot it at home once and didn't have money (or friends to borrow money from) to buy some at the convenience store at the end of the parking lot. My lips cracked and bled in many places that day. I remember holding my pursed lips to the water from a fountain for the coldness in an attempt to numb out the pain.\n\nI had to withdraw from all baseball practices, because crouching and running was too painful in anything more than a few minute bursts. Even with knee-savers, I couldn't crouch down in a catcher's position without the inside of my knee feeling pain for at best the next 20+ minutes, at worst the rest of the day.\n\nAfter 3-4 months I got my first suicidal thought. I remember standing in the kitchen holding a knife thinking what would it be like if I just cut myself and bled for a while? But then fear and self-preservation kicked in and I told myself \"No Invincibear, this is bad, WTF are you thinking!?!?!\" and I put the knife down and prepared a bowl of Golden Grahams instead. I've otherwise not had suicidal thoughts before nor after the Accutane regimen.\n\nFast forward to adulthood and I still can't crouch for long without relatively intense pain in my knee that doesn't go away for a while.

There seems to be an Accutane 'canon' among qualified prescribers, i.e. derms, which limits the possibilities of treatment with this drug. Because the standard treatment protocol is to go all out, for as short a time as possible, the side effects are brutal. This leads to the reluctance of the derms to even trial Accutane treatment on patients with any but the most dire cases of cystic acne. The low dose regime reduces the side effects proportionally, which should be considered a good thing for all patients being treated with Accutane, even the worst cases. \n\nHere are some links to articles on treatment with low dose isotretinoin:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4037971/\n\nhttp://www.bpac.org.nz/BPJ/2013/November/acne.aspx\n\nhttp://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(05)04605-0/abstract?cc=y=\n\nhttp://www.mdedge.com/familypracticenews/article/56231/dermatology/low-dose-isotretinoin-tames-adult-acne", "id": "dahjsip"}, {"comment": "I second the long term microdose accutane, am planning to go on it myself in the event I suffer a relapse (but not before I try OP's skin care routine!).

I have got genetic acne as well and just got on accutane.  \n\nI can chip in here. My whole family have acne, and for the women, it tends to stay their whole adult life. The derm I saw asked about my family history and made a point of mentioning it in the clinic report. I originally got off Accutane in March (I did a standard 5 month course, cumulative dose of 120mg / kg). My acne came back after a few weeks, and after 2 months I went back on it for another 3 months. I've now been off it for over 2 months and the results are holding so far. However, I can't agree with all the posts online that say things like,  'my skin looks like porcelain!'. It does look really really good. The angry inflamed spots from my back are gone. My T zone is perfect - I don't have a spotty chin for the first time in years. However, my around my jaw I have lots of (I think) closed comedones, and some of them turn into red spots that leave red marks, although I'd say it's not really inflamed anymore, and it's significantly improved. I don't think these are caused by my routine because I have added all my products carefully and intentionally, and in addition, I have a similar kind of spots of my chest (former acne zone, and place that only gets washed with hypoallergenic products in the shower). So it was worth it, but I don't feel like I'm cured. I think the pores are still clogging to some degree, but they're not moving on to the inflamed stage. The spots actually look a lot like keratosis pilaris - kind of dry hard plugs rather than gunky, tender acne spots. I'm also now using 10% azelaic acid from PC. The last derm I saw told me that you shouldn't need to use anything afterwards if you've had the right dose... This is all my from hypercritical perspective though.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. My BIL took it all in stride and apologized. He turned the cups so they matched. \n\nAnother day while I was there I was about to go down into the basement to put my laundry in the dryer. Suddenly my sister is standing directly behind me. I smiled and asked her if she was going down there too and she said no. In her hands she had a sponge and a bottle of cleaner. She told me she was going to wipe off my fingerprints from the door knob and the door. Whoa. \n\nOther things have happened over the years that showed me that my sister has OCD. One other thing is that she knew exactly how far the distance was from point A to point B and I am talking about the exact distance. If you asked me how far is the grocery store from my house I would say, oh a couple of miles. My sister would tell you it was exactly 2.7 miles. \n\nIn *this* conversation she was driving and talking to me on her Bluetooth device and we were just having a casual conversation about where she was going.

I just recently moved out of a house where I was rooming with 3-4 guys (I'm a woman) and now I'm living with two women and I feel so much better. I left the house for serious reasons (one of the guys was doing hard drugs in our house and acting really creepy) but it's not until now that I realized how toxic that situation was for me. I did so much emotional labor in that house, it was insane. I don't think the place would have ever been cleaned or important shit taken care of if it weren't for me, and it was *exhausting* because I hated nagging constantly. I felt like a sitcom housewife and I felt like no one would take my concerns seriously (especially my concerns re: the guy on drugs because... yeah, no one did.) because I was always complaining about petty household stuff. Seriously, I'm kind of a slob, but these guys were disgusting! One of them even used to call me and ask me to move his clothes out of the fucking washing machine into the dryer. The same guy left a vomit-stained pair of jeans in a tub of fetid water in our basement/laundry room for *months* and acted like he didn't know what I was talking about when I asked him about it (multiple times).\n\nI've been going over there to pack up my stuff and it looks like they cleaned up a little, but the cat box is filthy. I don't think any of them have cleaned it since the last time we did when I was there (yeah, I was usually the one who cleaned the box regularly. sigh)\n\nIt's been really stressful moving out of the house but I feel intense glee knowing that I don't have to come home to that mess and the fucking tower of dirty dishes and the \"those aren't my dishes tho!!\" excuses when I confront them about it.

He seemed to think that the only way you ever clean a cat box is when you completely empty it out, scrub it, replace the litter etc. And it was too much of a hassle to clean regularly. I told him that yeah you're supposed to do that like... once a month but on top of that you're supposed to REGULARLY, as in every day, scoop out the poop and solid pee chunks. He never did that. I was the only one who did regular scooping of the solids but when I informed him of this he told me \"well ok but it's still dirty so IDK why you did that.\" GAAAHHHH\n\nThere was poop in front of the litter boxes last time I was there!

I'm not saying this describes you, but generally the \"husband\" jobs around the house are a lot more interesting and satisfying than the wife jobs.

I begged and pleaded for the manager to hire more people to help me. He said no. I begged for a raise, a promotion, anything to make the stress seem worth it I guess. He said no to everything I ever asked for (unless it was related to something potentially violating health codes or OSHA) because supposedly the bar didn't make enough money.\n\nAnyway I was dying on the inside. I started developing health issues. Severe pain in my right pelvis that doctors couldn't explain and painkillers didn't help. Constant pain in my wrists and knuckles I thought was carpal tunnel syndrome but none of the usual treatments worked.  I felt like I had colds all the time and had issues breathing in the mornings. I also had constant breakouts on my face despite getting rid of that stuff with Accurate years ago. I was so miserable.  I endured being in constant pain for months. \n\nI started hardcore job searching and I walked out of that hellhole job as soon as I got hired somewhere else. Never gave them a notice, never even said I quit. Just calmly walked out and never looked back.\n\nThe weight off my shoulders was mind blowing and literally within 48 hours ALL my pain and health issues were gone.

My comment isn't skin care related but semi related to the effects of stress from a job.\n\nI worked at a very busy coffee and juice bar for a year, I pretty much ran the place entirely on my own for like 8 months of that year. I did the inventory, all the ordering, took all the orders, made all the drinks. I worked 50-60 hours every week. I was ridiculously stressed out. I begged and pleaded for the manager to hire more people to help me. He said no. I begged for a raise, a promotion, anything to make the stress seem worth it I guess. He said no to everything I ever asked for (unless it was related to something potentially violating health codes or OSHA) because supposedly the bar didn't make enough money.\n\nAnyway I was dying on the inside. I started developing health issues. Severe pain in my right pelvis that doctors couldn't explain and painkillers didn't help. Constant pain in my wrists and knuckles I thought was carpal tunnel syndrome but none of the usual treatments worked.  I felt like I had colds all the time and had issues breathing in the mornings. I also had constant breakouts on my face despite getting rid of that stuff with Accurate years ago. I was so miserable.  I endured being in constant pain for months. \n\nI started hardcore job searching and I walked out of that hellhole job as soon as I got hired somewhere else. Never gave them a notice, never even said I quit. Just calmly walked out and never looked back.\n\nThe weight off my shoulders was mind blowing and literally within 48 hours ALL my pain and health issues were gone. It's been 3 months and I haven't had one single issue or felt any of that mystery pain. \n\nThe effects of stress on the body are insane. ", "id": "davxopm"}], [{"comment": "This is so impressive!

Now  I used to have issues with flaky skin especially in the winter. CeraVe was the only moisturizer that didnt seem to break me out or give me weird reactions, at least from what I had tried so far which felt like everything. I started oil cleansing (not 100% OCM method, I use Garnier Cleansing Oil) and found my skin got a lot less flakey. Still dry from time to time but not nearly as bad. And the oil didnt break me out! My acne actually improved a little bit because my skin (before using oil) would dry out so much that my skin would pump out a bunch of oil to compensate. \n\nNow I'm on accutane and the Cerave wasn't powerful enough to keep my skin from getting dry (if you're unaware, one of Accutane's most prominent side effects is [extreme skin dryness](http://emotibot.net/pix/914.jpg)). I had to improvise. I had already been using Aquaphor (very similar to vaseline, I think it just has one extra ingredient) on my lips and nose (allergies-->blow my nose a lot-->nostrils get dry and ouchy) and decided to try it on my face. Sluglife basically. What a difference! my skin feels awesome, I only \"feel\" the dryness on my face when I get out of the shower, right before I put the aquaphor on my face. I'm glad I thought of it because if I had gone this long with using just Cerave my face would be in pain every day. The first few weeks of accutane for me were pretty painful as far as my face was concerned because it was just so dry and constantly peeling and flaking off in huge sheets. Aquaphor 100% fixed that. i actually use the walgreens version of it in a big tub because a) its cheaper and b) the consistency of the walgreens one is a little less viscous so it's more spreadable and doesn't feel as heavy on my face as brandname Aquaphor does. \n\nTry aquaphor (or the store brand version)! I know it sounds crazy and youll feel like a slug for a few hours but what I usually do is put it on heavy and then after like 30 mins I'll take a tissue and kinda pat my face a little bit to get rid of the shine.

Then I would pour hydrogen peroxide over it (the wound) again. Let it air dry.  Do this 3x a day until a dry crust starts to form.  Then start applying straight vitamin E once the crust starts falling off.  Another thing I swear by is essential oil of Lavender. Neat (meaning undiluted). Directly on the wound. Caution: only true lavender essential oil. No blends. Nothing mixed with a carrier oil. Lavender is a natural antibacterial/anti microbial. It will prevent infection and will heal the wound hyper speed. No scars. I learned about the lavender later in life and used it on some severe burns that my dad got on his arm.

I knew of the possibility of mental side effects, but when it is happening, you may not truly link it to the medicine because you need a sound mind to make such a connection! First, when I would drive, I had this very calm urge to crash my car but not hurt myself or anyone else.  Just crash it. Next, I had this super unsettling feeling that I needed to break my arms.  I was obsessing over if I could slam my forearms hard enough into the corner of the kitchen counter or the railing of my stairs to break them.  It felt like I would never feel \"ok\" unless I broke my arms. Last, my boyfriend woke me up and said I was crying hysterically in my sleep.  He asked what I was dreaming about.  All I knew was that I had this deep feeling that I needed to jump out the bedroom window.  Like, nothing would ever be right unless I jumped out the window.  It didn't feel like a dream, it felt like I was awake. When I told him that he immediately said \"OMG its the Accutane!!!!\" and I immediately snapped out of it and agreed. I felt simultaneously relieved and disturbed.  I called my doctor first thing in the morning and he instructed I stop taking it.

In fact, it is a potent chemotherapy agent.\n\nNow, please explain to me how an anti-cancer drug gets rid of the cancer in the first place AND after you do that, think about what that means to non-cancerous tissue.\n\nOh that's right, it's clear you have very minimal understanding of what cancer is and how one gets it so your mind became very overwhelmed and you concluded, \"everything causes cancer!\".\n\nI know it's complex. But everything *doesn't* cause cancer. \n\nBack to how chemotherapy drugs work and the consequences of using chemotherapy medications. \n\nFirst of all, since you sound so knowledgable about cancer given that you shared your opinion here, what is cancer?\n\nCancer cells are YOUR cells in which acquired DNA mutations in the classes of tumor suppressor mutations, ooncogenes and DNA repair mutations in the flavor of point mutations, frameshifts, INDELS and even, whole chromosome translocations/inversions and genome-wide instability (catastophies) in some cases. \n\nThese mutations allow the cell harboring them to **grow uncontrollably** regardless of DNA damages accumulated, amongst many other phenotypic changes (angiogenesis, independent of external signaling, immortalization, metabolic alternations..).\n\nChemotherapy drugs **target actively dividing cells**.\nNow, this will kill malignant cancer cells because they are always dividing!\n\nBut it will also kill any other rapidly dividing cells (think about the hair loss in cancer patients; it's from chemotherapy medications).\n\nAccutane= retinoic acid. A Vit. A derivative. Retinoic acid is interesting in that it is a transcription factor. Meaning it binds to DNA (two main DNA receptors, RAR, RXR) and regulates gene transcription. \n\nThis will be how it signals cancer cell death. But it is also what makes it dangerous and have a large side-effect profile, including tetragenic (causes birth defects).\n\nI realized I have much more important things to do, then compose a nice piece on this for you... because you won't understand given your statement about lol. Gots to go.\n\nHas side-effect profile, is thought to cause several syndromes and organ damage.\n\nHere's wiki.

Lacking quickness of perception or intellect.\n\n2.  Mentally slow\n\n3.  Slow to learn or understand; lacking intellectual acuity\n\nSo... yes, my response was \"wordy\" or \"long-winded\" but not obtuse.\nJust try to think *a little bit* before you throw words up.\n\nLet's discuss what you found to be illogical? Was the cancer mechanism illogical? How about that putting a chemotherapy drug on the skin? Or maybe that one probably shouldn't form opinions about cancer risks (i.e. going outside/plastics/breathing lol) when they are unaware of what cancer really is, let alone how a person acquires cancerous cells?\n\n\n", "id": "daqa8yr"}], [{"comment": "Just going to put this here:\n\nhttps://www.drugwatch.com/accutane/lawsuit.php", "id": "dapk75g"}]]], "50c5w3": ["[Humor] My reaction when I see a fellow rosacea person suffering with flare ups in the heat", "2016-08-30 21:00:52", 1015, "https://i.imgur.com/MheqbhZ.gif", [[47, "Hah, I feel this!\n\nNow I must pause while I sing \"Oh Canada\".

Did you get any fine lines from using Accutane? \n\nI'm 25 and took it for 5 months. I stupidly listened to the nurse's advice about using lightweight oil free moisturisers, which resulted in my skin flaking / peeling every morning. Right at the end of the course, I noticed some fine lines on my forehead. I started using a richer moisturiser in that area and it went back to normal. After I finished, my skin became plump and soft again after a week or two. I've been asked if I'm under 18 twice this week. So I don't believe it causes fine lines, and if you keep moisturizing and using sunscreen you should be just fine. Some derms also give a lower dose for a longer amount of time to reduce side effects (the cumulative dose is what counts).\nOther people on Reddit say they've been told by their derms a lower dose for a longer time works better for persistent adult acne. I didn't do this though - I took 60mg a day, while a low dose is something like 20mg. \n\nAlso, I should add that I took mine over the winter and I think that really contributed to the dryness. I'm doing an extension course at the moment and my skin doesn't even feel that dry. It still looks really shiny after I put in biore watery essence in the am. \n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you have about Accutane, and taking it when you're officially too old for this shit.

Isn't that redundant?\n\nNot really, and even if they did *exactly* the same thing (which they don't!) it would be upping the firepower.\n\nBut they don't do the same thing, exactly. Put as simply as I can, retinol (and retinoids) actually interact with skin cells by binding to cellular receptors and \"telling\" the skin to *create more new cells.* As a result, the skin makes many new cells before it usually would, and eventually there's more cells building up beneath the surface, resulting in thicker lower-layers and \"firmer\" skin, and once they do get to the top layer, they're \"newer\" and \"fresher.\" As long as you keep applying it, your skin continues to churn out new skin cells at an increased rate, so you end up with a lot of skin cells that are \"fresher\" throughout your skin.\n\nBHA (Salycylic acid/SA) is sometimes called a 'keralytic agent' which basically means it penetrates through and softens the gunk in pores and causes the extracellular matrix keeping skin cells stuck together to dissolve ('lysis' roughly means to break down), so the outer layer of skin 'sheds' before it would otherwise. Beyond chemically exfoliating the outside layer of skin (and revealing the less-old cells underneath), BHA/SA has some other benefits. For one, it's anti-inflammatory, and also has some (weak) anti-microbial properties.\n\nSo in short, BHA/SA \"sloughs off\" the outer layer of skin, wheras retinol/retinoids directly tell the skin to create more new cells throughout it. The end results (like increased skin turnover) can be similar, but the way that was caused differ, and it can also have some slight differences in the end result. ", "id": "d3vuvn8"}, {"comment": "Wow, thank you for this! I will probably start incorporating both. What about benzoyl peroxide, are there benefits to using it and if so what are they? If you don't mind explaining that one to me!", "id": "d3vwzux"}, {"comment": "Sure! I don't mind at all :).\n\nBenzoyl peroxide (BP) is mainly just helpful for acne because of it's powerful antibacterial action, and in fact was one of the earliest medications used in modern medicine to treat it! (Retinoids were discovered like half a century after BP was being used for acne). While retinol/retinoids and SA can both have 'anti-aging' benefits in addition to helping acne, BP doesn't really, and a big part of that is because of how it works.\n\nWhen BP is applied to skin, it breaks down into two things: (1) oxygen and (2) benzoic acid. The oxidization causes tiny oxygen bubbles on the surface of skin and even inside the pores, which help loosen things up a bit, but the real power of BP is because that oxygen kills anarobic bacteria, such as p. acnes, the bacteria that acne originally got it's name from. Because BP works by oxidization, bacteria can't really develop a resistance to it like it might with many antibacterial agents. The benzoic acid plays its part, too, because it's *also* antibacterial (and anti-microbial in general), which is why it's commonly used in products as a preservative. \n\nNow, BP is pretty drying, because, well, it's sorta working by blasting the cells and pores with oxygen up-close. That can be somewhat helpful, because it induces some peeling just as a byproduct of drying skin out (this is significant because BP was first put into use before other things that caused peeling, like SA, became 'a thing.' In SA's case it became popular only recently in like the 1990's!). The drying can also combat over-production of sebum (oil), which is is part of the problem in *some* people. But acne has many factors, and it's caused by *far* more than just \"oily skin\" or even just bacterial over-growth. It can vary based on the person quiet a bit, really.

Also, if you're interested in retinol/retinoids... you can actually get a prescription for a retinoid from a regular GP. Prescription-strength retinoids are significantly more potent/effective than anything you'll really find over-the-counter, but there's another benefit to going prescription strength, too -  if you have health insurance, they'll often cover it partially or entirely and the price you pay will end up cheaper than many OTC products. I was on Adapalene (AKA Differin, which is the weakest prescription retinoid) for a while, and picking up a tube of it from the pharmacy cost me a whopping 8 dollars (and eventually zero). Now I'm on Trentonin (Retin-A, a stronger prescription retinoid) and it cost me nothing. Most of the OTC products with retinol in them that I've seen are $30+, and on the low end they the amount of retinol is rather disappointingly just traces.

My t-zone gets a bit oily in the summer; not too bad but I'll use rice paper mid-day.\n\n* I had my son at 19 so my skin decided to be an asshole and give me acne. I didn't know how to deal with it properly so I used the methods that were around in the late 90s which were usually things like Proactiv and other OTCs that were way too harsh. In my mid-20s (early 00s) there was a shift where people started really paying attention to skin care in the sense of actual care and not just treatment after the fact and makeup to cover it. Better products and more information (from physical books haha) started becoming available to people other than aestheticians and so started my trek into finding stuff that worked for me on my very limited single mom budget. After that it was years of trial and error, education, and trying to combat my compulsion to pick when I was having a bad day. By my mid-30s I had found products that were beneficial to my skin and started introducing things like chemical exfoliants and retinols into my routine slowly. I've been using the routine above for a few years now. (Whooo that's a block of text, but I hope that answers 2 and 3.)\n\n* The coconut oil was initially to remove makeup, but it's also good for removing sunscreen. In all honesty I may not \"need\" that step on days I don't wear makeup but I just kind of like the way it feels. \n\n* My routine has only affected my makeup choices in that I don't feel compelled to wear it as often as I used to and when I do I don't have to wear a lot of it. I hated not being able to wear it at work at first because I was so self-conscious but that was due more to the circles under my eyes making me look tired. I also ended up trying microblading for my barely-there brows which was a total game changer for me and worth every penny.

So say if you use ponds at night then after your nightly routine you would use ponds first then after applying you would use vaseline on top of that.    \n\nThis way the barrier Vaseline makes locks the moisturizer (Ponds) in and so the Ponds doesn't dehydrate so stays on your skin overnight. Since ponds is between your skin and the vaseline you don't have to worry about the vaseline sticking as a barrier on your skin.    \n\nBasically you want to put vaseline on your skin when you want to make a barrier. People use vaseline in wound care on small cuts because that barrier prevents the wound from scabbing over which stimulates the bodies cells to keep repairing twice as fast as when letting a wound scab over. Because the barrier of Vaseline is so thick it keeps out contaminants too so airborne germs/bacteria wont get to the wound. \n\nOthers believe it helps with pimples for the same reason. Because it starves the pimple for oxygen and water the bacteria dies quickly and pimples raise tot he surface faster.

The vortex one is the most intriguing to me because the person that it goes back to wasn't just some whacko quack. It was Viktor Schauberger. He thought about water circulation in nature. Like water evaporates with the help of the heat of the sun, rains down, gets soaked up by the ground, gets soaked up by plants, evaporates again... In his mind only water that completed all parts of his circulation was good but water that rained down on eroded earth for instance was not as good. He tried to invent a machine that mimics this circulation to revitalize stale water. Ok thats the short version, so why was he not just a nutjob? \n\nBased on his own theories he developed other solutions. One of them was a system to transport logs from the mountain to the valley with water ways. He used his vortex theory (his key element to vitalize water) to transport even dense wood that was not floating easily. His was the first system that didn't suffer from jamming. IIRC he built these systems in Austria and Germany. It is well documented and parts of these systems are still there today. Based on his ideas recently they started to introduce boulders in a v formation into rivers in Germany. This creates a stream pattern that prevents the riverbank from eroding without it having to be protected with wood or concrete.\n\nThis stuff goes even deeper. He apparently tried to developed a propulsion system, the \"repulsine\". This ties into various myth about Hitler and flying saucers that apparently used it. Its really strange because the base of it is pretty down to earth. I guess its similar to the myths around Nikola Tesla.

I'm also highly allergic to most acne medications, I've had three chemical burns on my face in the last five years. \n\nI was starting to have bipolar episodes when my acne was so painful as I had cysts all down my jaw that I took time off work because I couldn't stop crying and my derm suggested this and I took the opportunity. \n\nI'm dairy free, I don't have processed food and I don't drink alcohol. So before you make a remark like this you should ask questions and not assume. ", "id": "da8krjp"}, {"comment": "You have incorrect ideas of what spreads acne. Understand that when you say you wear gloves to not touch your face, that is just crazy. That is a germ theory that does not make sense. The sebum on your skin should be healthy, touching one part of your body to the next should not make a difference. You are being duped by a whack germ theory.\n\nThe problem is people on a regular bases destroy their sebum. Every time you put soap on your skin, you are chemically cleaning your skin. What I want you to know is, you are supposed to mechanically clean your skin. Only use water and a washcloth in the shower on your body, with the exception of underarms and genitalia. This will maintain your sebum, it will prevent you from stinking so fast, it will strengthen a major aspect of your immune system. \n\nI appreciate you being honest about bipolar disorder, but what is interested about bipolar is how it is connected to acne. 90% of serotonin is produced in your gut, if you take anti-biotics, or consume neurotoxins like MSG, gluten, or take pharmaceuticals, you disrupt the natural bacteria that lives in your gut. When the bacteria is not balanced, you become vulnerable to other bacteria types taking over, such as candida. People with bipolar disorder have acne because acne and bipolar both stem from poor gut health.  \n\nThe other thing that is interesting about bipolar and acne, is that almost every single person with bipolar disorder has forward head carriage, a reversal in the natural curve in their neck, and poor posture. This is caused by a subluxation in the spin, which means the juxtaposition of one vertebrae is displaced in relation to the vertebrae above and below. Sublexation translates to Less than, light, action. You are receiving less energy up your spin when it is not aligned. This lack of energy does not stimulate your mind fully, and leads to your brain literally not detoxing properly. People with acne also frequently have dandruff, which is just the scalp detoxing. \n\nNow you may think I'm a random person making assumptions about you, and maybe that is true, but I do very much care about you as a person. The medical industry is literally out to get you and make you sick. I may be a random person, but maybe I am the only thing preventing you from entering onto that slippery slope of medication. A day will come when you chose to fight another symptom with a drug, and then you will be on two drugs. It does't end.  \n\nI highly recommend you visit a chiropractor before you take any medication. If you think I am insane for connecting chiropractics with skin health, so be it. Still go see one. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nagzlodujM) is presented by a highly skilled chiropractor, and he will explain how everything is connected and how you're being tricked into thinking a pill is a good idea.\n\nI understand that it can be upsetting to read this type of information, but you should never stop questioning what you think you know. A chiropractor can help you achieve total body health, your bodies natural state. This information should empower you, it should make you feel like you have control. \n\nGood luck.

I have seen General practitioners, OB/GYN, rheumatologists, endocrinologists, dermatologists, even homopathetic doctors and aestheticians in regards to my acne (similar to OPs).

No back cracking or detoxing fully gets rid of it. \n\nI didn't agree with taking accutane the first time I took it, I also took 6 months to decide to go back on the drug for a second time when my acne came back.

Dermatologists don't hand the drug out like it's candy, it is the last resort when other methods don't work.

This time, though, it was more bulbous, red, and it began to hurt. I started developing small red streaks around the edges of the cyst and decided to go to the Urgent Care clinic near me. Turns out my sebaceous cyst had become infected - all that growth was generated by puss and the infection under the skin. I had to have the cyst poked and drained. The smell was putrid!

After taking antibiotics for two weeks to deal with the infection, we had the procedure done on a Friday afternoon. This was almost a year ago, now. The scar on my face is very small - hardly noticeable! \n\nI'm betting that the injection you received was steroid of some sort.

I received a steroid shot from a surgeon after having a consultation to have it removed, like you did. We decided that surgery on my face wasn't necessary and there was a chance for the cyst to go away over time without the need to make a scar near my eye. The cyst stayed and never fully went away, but it returned to its 'normal' size, maybe even a bit smaller. \n\nYears went by until about January of 2015 and the cyst began to swell and it grew to the size of a silver dollar once more. This time, though, it was more bulbous, red, and it began to hurt. I started developing small red streaks around the edges of the cyst and decided to go to the Urgent Care clinic near me. Turns out my sebaceous cyst had become infected - all that growth was generated by puss and the infection under the skin. I had to have the cyst poked and drained. The smell was putrid! After about two weeks of healing, I went to see a surgeon again for another consult. This time, it was decided that I'd get the cyst removed completely, for good. After taking antibiotics for two weeks to deal with the infection, we had the procedure done on a Friday afternoon. This was almost a year ago, now. The scar on my face is very small - hardly noticeable! \n\nI'm betting that the injection you received was steroid of some sort.

It didn't hurt, couldn't really be moved, and wasn't discolored. At first, it looks like a normally colored, large zit without the whitehead. After the first injection from the first surgeon consultation I had, the cyst almost went away completely. A few years afterwards, the cyst redeveloped in the same area.

I'm getting KP on my legs now too, so maybe my body just likes to over produce keratin and it's not a reaction to a product, not sure.

If someone gets really badly burnt they put a mask over their face so the moisture can't evaporate as easily, which in turns helps the skin heal (at least I think that's what happens, I could be talking out my ass). I think vaseline does something similar for the small open wounds from picking.\n\nI just googled and got this:\n\n\"Heal Wounds Faster with Vaseline\n\nVaseline (petroleum jelly) not only keeps wounds clean and moist but also provides an occlusive layer, thus keeps the wound covered. It keeps germs out decreasing the risk on infection. Apart from that it hydrates the wound stimulating the healing process.\n\nIf you have tried it once yourself you will probably have noticed the wound scabs far less. Normally the creation of a scab is accompanied by a little inflammation. The skin surrounding the wound is a little bit pink or red colored and raised. Also itch resulting in scratching the scab off is not desirable. When using Vaseline the wound will scab less and the new skin will be less raised (or not at all) and with less discolorization.\n\nVaseline, being a non-irritating product, also soothes minor scrapes and burns (also sunburns).\"\n\n[But it's not from a scientific source :P.](http://www.surgerysupplements.com/how-to-heal-open-wounds-faster/)", "id": "d23bzoo"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d233l86"}, {"comment": "That'd be the epiduo.

Why'd you chose jojoba for OCM and how do you make sure you get all the oil residue off? \n\nYour routine incorporates a few things I'm afraid of *because* of my acne haha:\n\n1) Sunscreen. I've never found one that doesn't break me out and I've completely given up trying. Fortunately, I live in a cloudy place (Michigan), and am only outside before the sun rises in the morning and at night. \n\n2) Cerave PM (fatty alcohols): contains the combination of Cetearyl Alcohol and Ceteareth-20 as 5th ingredient not counting water, which rates a 4 out of 5 for pore clogging in rabbit ear assays when used in this combination. I'm almost certain this breaks me out.\n\n3) Jojoba OCM. This I'm thinking about trying. I've never tried OCM, but I have an innate fear of oils cuz acne and my skin seems to hate everything. I've used jojoba before, but most of my experience with it comes from using Acne.org's moisturizer, which I'm almost certain was breaking me out. But that's because it contains other ingredients that I don't think my skin was okay with. I've never tried pure jojoba oil, but I think I need to! Hopefully it doesn't break me out when I patch test. (jojoba oil doesn't turn your skin yellow like the color of the oil, does it?) \n\nA couple more significant questions: What change to your routine or what product do you think helped most with clearing up your acne? Which product damaged your moisture barrier/repaired your moisture barrier the most?  I noticed you were on tretinoin .05% in the past. Do you think that helped much compared to the benzoyl peroxide?

So, it's kind of an OCM alternative to skin that's sensitive to oils but is still easily dried out (which is my skin lol). The tretinoin was very irritating, and ultimately was the cause of my redness and lack of moisture barrier. which is what it's supposed to do, but it wasn't getting better. I use 10% because I started off with it, and since I've never felt it at all irritating, I don't want to try others.

Should you have gotten antibiotics during or after? Did you need stitches for closure? Did this need irrigation or packing?\n\nLate care: any complications to deal with? Did you heal? Are you at risk of recurrence or anther lesson popping up?\n\nI think you need to go see a primary care doc to get this checked on and possibly a surgeon. Usually a doc will refer you back to the surgeon to deal with their surgery, so you may end up getting referred to one.

Typically you heat compress and wait until the skin softens on top and forms a scab/head. I literally just did one on my shoulder that popped up a few days ago. The skin had softened last night, and by this morning there was a light scabbing over it. I was prepared to lance with a 21g needle, but as I was lightly prepping the abscess with an alcohol swab, the scab disintegrated and the abscess immediately began to drain, and with a little pressure some solids came out. The key is to remember that your body is an incredibly complex and intelligent machine. It naturally rounds up the infection and brings it to the surface. All you have to do is keep the wound sterile and don't force anything, or you can risk having a subdermal rupture which is no beuno. \n\nWith all that being said, I have been researching and doing this for 10 years so I wouldn't advise a novice to do as I do without professional help.

Also you can see all the Drunk Elephant products on their website or on Sephora. Their c serum is the bottle with the orange cap, it's called C-firma. I can't provide a link because I'm at work.\n\n>**AM routine**: \n\n>1. Cleanse with Juju bar (I have it near my shower but not in it, so that it isn't under running water and constantly being wasted). I lather it up with my hands, rub it on my face, and then use a Foreo Luna mini2 to give it a ~two minute massage\n\n>2. Mix one pump of the b-hydra moisturizer with one pump of the c-firma day serum (I pump both onto one fingertip and then mix them with both pointer fingertips, to minimize wasting product) and spread on my face and neck (mixing a pump of each covers my whole face and neck), and wait 5-10 mins\n\n>3. Drunk Elephant's sunscreen\n\n>4. Primer, concealer, foundation, setting spray, setting powder (I can go into further detail if you want; I use a no-makeup-makeup routine. I'm a dude though so it doesn't include half the products women use)\n\n\n>**PM routine**:\n\n>1. Cleanse with Pekee bar (same method as #1 above)\n\n>2. TLC glycolic serum (one pump covers my whole face and neck) and wait about 10 mins\n\n>3. Sometimes I add a couple drops of the DE marula facial oil, but this is just from a sample I got. I'm kinda on the fence about what to do next. Part of me just wants to skip the oil, due to the price, and then introduce it later to see if it makes a difference. Part of me wants to get the DE oil and mix one drop of it with my night serum (I used to not be cool with the idea of mixing them, because I didn't want to waste product by mixing it in the palm of my hand, but someone gave me the idea of mixing them in a contact case so that I don't waste anything). Then, a part of me wants to get a non-DE brand of marula oil (much cheaper) and use a few drops at night.\n\n>I don't use the marula oil in the morning because it gives me a bit too much shine, and I prefer a matte look. However since I'm working with a sample and I don't have the dropper, if I get the dropper, I'm going to experiment with mixing one drop of the marula oil with my moisturizer and day serum (in the contact case) and see how good that is. \n\n>If your routine and products work then don't fix what's broken! My routine was really lacking, my complexion was terrible, and I was breaking out a lot, so that's why I finally gave DE a try. And good god am I happy I did.\n\n>EDIT: Forgot to add that I also use their Shaba eye complex cream. It's pretty nice but it's $85 so I'm not sure if I'm gonna keep it.

Otherwise I would suggest finding a reasonably-priced AHA and BHA, as well as vitamin C serum. I'm sure many brands make ones that work well and are much cheaper than Drunk Elephant, but the DE line is specifically made so that the products work well in harmony with each other, so it's just tougher to tell if other brand products are formulated the same way.

As someone allergic to most sunscreens I always read the label. I definitely don't need someone to remind me. ", "id": "d3oc1p3"}, {"comment": "> always have to warn people\n\nThe implication here seems to be that if they didn't, they'd have a realistic chance of trouble over it. If someone put on the sunscreen and got sick because they're allergic to it, I really doubt the bar would be found liable: nothing about the sign guarantees that it's allergen-free, for instance, and a person who knows they're allergic to a particular chemical should be checking the label anyway. In order to get tort damages against a business, generally one has to show (1) the plaintiff was harmed (2) because the defendant acted in an unreasonable, negligent way. (Gross oversimplification, I know, but I can't fit a 1L Torts class into a comment.) But it probably took a lot less time to just write the warning on the sign than to go google some case law.\n\nI don't think we see these notices because there's a real risk of being found liable. I think we see these notices because:\n\n1. The notices don't really cost anything, and might provide *some* genuine benefit to really stupid people. (People who would lose in court, but whom we still don't want to see get hurt.)  \n2. Media, and I think some measure of corporate propaganda, have amplified people's natural fears of litigation. It's a bit like how many people are scared of flying: it's highly unlikely that there'll be a plane crash, but if there is, it will be bad, and people are more anxious about such things when there's an accompanying feeling of not being in control, which increases one's sense of vulnerability.\n\nSo I hesitate to say things like, \"It's sad how everyone has to put warning labels on everything these days!\" Especially inasmuch as it's a buildup to pushes by big corporations to reduce tort liability for faulty products that kill or injure people. A court is one of the few places where an individual person and a giant corporation even nominally have similar amounts of power. (Of course, the corporation has better lawyers, and more ability to absorb risk, and so on, but there's at least some kind of notion that a third party will determine who was right based on some kind of ruleset.)\n\n**tl;dr: People who are allergic to chemicals in sunscreen should know to check the label already. And thus I doubt that not putting up this notice would do much to expose the business to liability. But it might just prevent a very bad day for a random stupid person with allergies, and if someone does get sick, it might slightly decrease the already very low chance that the bar would be found negligent. So I guess I don't see it as too terribly sad that the warning is here.**", "id": "d3on9hu"}], [{"comment": "Where is this?", "id": "d3o3kdr"}, {"comment": "It's a tap room in South West London called By The Horns. \nDoes an amazing beer brewed with Earl Grey tea called Old Smoke.", "id": "d3oj1ha"}, {"comment": "London has beaches?", "id": "d3ok7it"}, {"comment": "London has sun?", "id": "d3ol32s"}, {"comment": "No - but you still need suncreen if you're sitting out in a beer garden all day. \n\nIn fact the only time I used to get burnt was when in the UK because I thought 'it's England I don't need to protect my skin' but 25 degrees is 25 degrees regardless of the land mass.", "id": "d3oxbjv"}, {"comment": "It's a rooftop terrace called \"The Loft\" in Wimbledon, South West London, above The Alexandra.", "id": "d3p1kdj"}, {"comment": "It looks like \"Lush\" ", "id": "d3oe2jc"}, {"comment": "I think it's actually a bar, there's a beer tap on the far right side of the frame.

Think of your torso as a rectangle (it's not but this is a hypothetical). Shallow roots mean that your boobs stay all on the one long side that is your \"front.\" Deep roots mean that your breast tissue continues onto the short sides of the rectangle as well as being on the \"front\" long side. I've got the latter, in that my boobs realistically continue to the back edge of my armpit (towards the \"back\" corners of the rectangle).
