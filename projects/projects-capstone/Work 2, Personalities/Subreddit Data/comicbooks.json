They're too oval and makes it look more alien rather than the demonic look batman should incorporate. If you had where it had incorporated the angry slanted white eyes from the comics and cartoon, it could potentially have worked really well. I think Nolan and his team thought Batman should look like a bat when in fact, he should really be more of a demon in aesthetic. \n\nMy real problem with the Bale batman look is that:\n\n1) His neck is too skinny in comparison with his head. This is more a problem with the shape of his headpiece. It's far too bulky and round. The BB shape was a lot more impressive and intimidating but still not perfect.\n\n2) The cowl in general isn't very good. Having the mouth area be so round and small makes it look more like a helmet. The ears are too much like rabbit ears rather than the sharp devil horns that make past batmans so intimidating. The forehead is too big and diminishes the rest of the cowl. Also, the nose area on it is gigantic and highlights Bale's slighly weak chin. The effect overall is kinda goofy. If it been kept more simple and closer to past iterations, I would have liked it.But so far, Batfleck is the best batsuit to me and even that has problems. \n\nThe rest of Bale's suit is cool in it's practicality but it also betrays just how built Bale became for the movies which is a pity. The shoulder pads and general busyness of the suit is a problem. The BB suit is better in that regard, if a tad too rubbery.\n\nAt the end of the day, there was too much focus on it protecting the wearer when it should have focused on its visuality.

Ex: Futurama on Comedy Central, Teen Titans Go, Arrested Development, Family Guy...\n\n3) I actually would like this to go on Cartoon Network instead of Netflix or Adult Swim. I know that sounds weird as I'm an adult and should want edgy, dark, mature shit but I do like the idea of tone consistency (ie geared toward kids, and not having gratutious sex, gore, cursing) and it being something kids can enjoy.

That's what he does and that's what his fans buy his work for. His work isn't significant outside of that. He does great, clean line work and I do line his stuff. There's nothing wrong with his cheesecake stuff. Hell, I've read two Jungle Girl trades and enjoyed it. But there really wasn't anything special happening there. There's nothing wrong with sexy wonder woman. I think Cho was going to toe that line as hard he could to see what he could get away with. I think he misses the point with Wonder Woman, though. She can be sexy. Frison is gong to draw her in sexy ways and is going to stir up shit. Just you wait! That thread is going to happen. But the key difference is that it's sexy vs. sexualized stuff. Now what you see that as is up to you, the other members of the audience. Same audience I'm apart of. (Something I feel people over look in lieu of stroking their own ego and idea of how thing should be.) Cho's work is a modern take on a style that's going it of fashion with readers, I think. He wasn't the best get for Wonder Woman, much less one written by a straight up feminist like Greg Rucka. He was likely brought on when Berganza was planned to be the editor on the title, but once Rucka came on he probably said \"No way in fuck am I writing with that hack Eddie fucking Berganza.\" So Cho ended up going along for the ride over to the Batman office who now over sees the WW flagship by Rucka.\n\nSo there's all that.

He probably just didn't think his work was very good. \n\n\"Don't bother\" isn't being a dick, it's lacking confidence\n\nedit: oops misread the tweet. Those guys were being dicks, don't be a dick.", "id": "d54ykwo"}, {"comment": "I'm going off of the tweet only.Here is the picture I got from it.\n\n\nFour guys are reviewing each other's portfolios in a comic book store. These are portfolios which means they are like a resume for any other job, it's meant to show what you can do. If anyone asks to see your portfolio you should be willing to show it for the exact reason that anyone could help you get a job or pay you for work themselves.  So this random guy is looking at comics and sees their drawings well enough to decide he would look at more. Doesn't seem like they were being too quiet or shy about their drawings if he could see them while browsing.\n\n\nSo random guy asks to see one of their portfolios and the response they give is to not bother them. Not \"don't bother, it's not good enough to show\" we know this because he's getting reviews from three other people. Not \"don't bother us right now because we have a meeting set and limited time to review each others work\" we know this because there are very few ways to politely convey that message or any polite message if you use the words \"don't bother us.\" Those are words you say to someone that's persistently trying to sell you something or someone offending you in some way. That is being a dick.\n\n\nNow let's look at the guy who tweeted this who's job it is to look at portfolios and discover new artists. Why didn't he just say who he was? How was that not being a dick? Two reasons really. One he was there just to buy comics  not to discover new talent and he just happened to see that one out of four people reviewing each other portfolios in the middle of a comic book store had talent and probably thought it would be rude to the other three if he introduced himself and only wanted to see one of their portfolios. Two, when he received a rude response of \"don't bother us\" he also received an insight into the personality of the artist and as someone that's in charge of hiring new artists it probably told him this guy wasn't a good candidate for a position. So why not blow their minds and let them know the huge opportunity they just missed? Give them a chance to be nice instead of rude? Why should he ruin their day? Why give them a second chance, when the first impression had already changed his mind?\n\n\nNow I'm reading a lot into a simple tweet but so is everyone else on this thread. I'm not calling the guys dicks. I'm sure they had no idea and just wanted the opinions of their peers not some random guy in a comic book store. There are better ways to handle it then saying \"don't bother us\" even asking if he could wait till they were done or asking if he had any experience looking at portfolios could have saved this opportunity for them. Even if the other three weren't good enough they could have received solid feedback from a professional by just asking and being polite. By being dicks to a stranger they missed a huge chance and I really hope someone came up afterwards and asked them what that mysterious stranger asked them and let them know exactly what they did because it sounds like they need to be humbled a little before they can get better.", "id": "d550o84"}, {"comment": "I appreciate the dedication you put into this, but I simply misread the tweet. \n\nI thought the guys said \"don't bother\" as in it's not good.

Why were they saying hi? It made me feel uncomfortable to feel I had to respond, and I assumed they'd know that, and were still doing it on purpose, and so I got angry at a perceived intentional attempt at being a dick.\n\nMeanwhile the people in question had just seen me around and were trying to be nice and include me in stuff.\n\nI'd actively avoid people to avoid being put in that situation. \n\nPart of the problem is that shy and introvert people often tend to remember the negative aspects of interactions more than the positive, and so it's self-reinforcing. It's a big shame, because we can't expect other people to see the difference, because outwards there may be no difference. \n\nE.g. I could very well see myself of a few years ago in a situation like the one described thinking that the guy in question was butting in with the intent of making fun of me, and getting accordingly defensive and rude as a defensive way of pre-empting a slight I'd be sure was coming.\n\nFor me it's taken a lot of conscious effort to re-interpret peoples interactions with me, and to change the way I'm reacting, as on top of always being on the defensive, putting in so much effort in avoiding these type of interactions also meant I didn't understand what was expected of me,  or how to react to common social cues.\n\nI can't know if that's the reason they reacted like this, but I generally don't like to assume people are intentionally being rude.\n\n(To be clear, I think his reaction of not trying to pursuse the matter was perfectly reasonable - we can't expect other people to try to figure out the reason they're being rejected)", "id": "d55errr"}, {"comment": "He said not to bother them.

But very few white characters are written with their whiteness as a core storytelling aspect of their character (in an explicit way at least), unless it is a negative. So some people think to themselves, why do any of the white characters need to stay white? I find myself thinking this sometimes in an emotive/reactionary sense. \n\nI mean ultimately I support your point, he's a new version of the character and he can be played by a black guy. Furthermore there IS a white flash on the show... before we consider context (or if people ignore it entirely), we wonder, will Wally then be a black guy from this point forward (outside of the show)? Will the character reboot and remain that way because it works and reaches the new audience? To take the case of Nick Fury, white Nick Fury is never coming back. I love Ultimate Fury, and later Sam Jackson in the role, but this is a given now right? His face is Fury. I think white people can be happy that black viewers/readers (and other poc) are seeing themselves in the game, I personally am, but there is a gnawing feeling that maybe the character I identify with (and that is not all of them which are white men) will be reborn as well. It's a little weird to reconcile a feeling of happiness for others with a fear of personal loss.\n\nBut again, the context matters.

It's true the color of the skin of most characters is not central to the personality in the comics. It's just the feeling of familiarity.\n\nTo pick up your example of Nick Fury, I found it pretty hard at first to deal with it. It was made easier by the fact that he was an Ultimate Universe character (and Nick in the normal Universe was dead/passing through a weird phase at that time).\n\nBut all in all there was a lot of story with the white Nick Fury going from his howling commandos time all the way to the 90s. I still miss the old Nick Fury sometimes, but mostly because he was a sort of childhood figure thing. \n\nThe new Nick Fury took me a while to get used to, but you're right that at this point he is THE Nick Fury. On the other hand Nick was not what I would call a main character...\n\nThe most important thing I guess is that the character is well written.

", "id": "d6b9fh6"}, {"comment": "Most of the changes bother me, I think it is because of how inorganic they are. Wally West was Flash for almost twenty years after being created as Kid Flash in '59. Wally's Flash is probably the most humane character in DC. They manage to write him as introspective and refusing to harm-not because of fear of public backlash (Superman) or because it crosses a line (Batman) but because the character personally see's it as deeply wrong. In the Comics, they race swapped Wally a few years ago btw.\n\nI think a lot of the backlash comes from a few avenues. Comics and particularly the Super-Hero genre, are among the few 'white' art forms of Americana. I don't mean that as an ownership thing, so much as an aspect that a lot of people were mocked for, up until the movies started making a lot of money. Then, they began swapping characters, you cited Fury (Which, I actually feel was a massive improvement.) but there are many others that were either race swapped, or gender swapped. \n\nDC changed things a long time ago to more of a mantle. Marvel was always a direct identity, recently though Marvel began the mantle route.\n\nBelow I will list some examples of changes. I think a lot of the angst is-a huge number of white guys (nerd outcasts, abusive homes etc.) only had comics as an outlet and escape. The characters for a lot of people have a special place. When they swap things-it stings people by the loss as much or more as it elates others by the inclusion. Not because of racism or sexism, but because they are part of childhood. The arguments seem to be a variant on inclusion-but I think it is phrased oddly. If people are unable to identify with a character based on race, do they not remove existing fans identification with said character by changing the race?\n\n\nExamples (Comics is where I will focus):\n\nCaptain Marvel: original male alien, swapped to Carol Danvers.\n\nMiss Marvel: Original Carol Danvers-now Khamal Khan.\n\nSpider-Man: Fans love Parker, but they changed him to a sad imitation of Tony Stark (even with spider-mobile and black guy side kick who puts on his suit as Body Guard ala War Machine), now prime Spider-Man is Miles Morales.\n\nFlash-Wally West: Race swapped.\n\nHulk: Now it is Amadeus Cho (Korean)\n\nCaptain America: Race Swap, possible gender/race swap. Replaced with a character who's only ability in comics was talking with birds, and had robotic wings. Had heard a story arc might replace Sam with a female clone of Sam.\n\nThor: \"Thor\" is his proper name. Gender swap, gave proper name to new character, renamed Thor to Odinson.\n\nWolverine: Gender Swap, X-23\n\nStar Lord: Quill was replaced with Kitty Pride.\n\n(DC) Green Lantern: Various swaps-however they did not remove previous, characters co-existed.\n\nGhost Rider: Now a Latina\n\nIron Man: Now a 14 year old black girl\n\nHawkeye: For awhile, replaced with a female\n\nIce Man: Sexuality swap\n\nThe list goes on, I noted off the top of my head. They toyed with replacing Frank Castle with Lynn Michaels (later named her Vendetta) and some similar one offs, that I don't think are really noteworthy.\n\nSo, I guess the question is: Does it matter? The answer would have to be yes, if it didn't matter, nobody would think about changing them to begin with. One item I wonder though-in some of the cases, it was a reboot or alternate scenario-but the characters are extremely similar to the original. Miles Morales for example was written as Parker for a long time before they managed to get him his own personality. \n\nI think there is some merit to the principle that people have an inclination for media (characters, stories etc.) that most resemble themselves. Backgrounds as well as obvious traits such as ethnicity, race, religion and the likes. Historically, readership has been mostly white males. I think the case could be made that other demographics were not interested because they didn't see themselves in it. Probably a factor in the swaps going on-however, there also appears to be cultural aspects. The resurgence of comics in the 80's-90's was fueled by white suburbanite angst. All the comics were 'gritty'. A good part of that popularity was a form of signaling. The comics were more mature and reading it was a sign of sorts that the kid reading it, was no longer a child. I think this reflects cultural aspects to it. Things probably changed since I last read up on demographics that buy comics-but most of the swaps showed a large decline in sales after the swap. That would seem to indicate in part, perhaps alienation of existing reader base, not only for no longer identifying, but also everyone on websites screaming 'racist' and 'sexist' at them for being upset that their sanctuary was changed. I think there is real danger in these swaps resulting in cancellation of titles and a decline in the art form.\n\nNote: I am talking about radical character changes. Not having main characters of different backgrounds.\n\nI think if they developed new or existing characters to prominence, everyone would be happier with it all. In the comics-Black Panther now has a very prominent role. They did it organically, and it works really well. Riri Williams, apparently, worlds biggest super genius, replacing Iron Man as a 14-15 year old black girl? That is extremely clumsy.\n\nBlade, Storm, Bishop, Luke Cage, Black Panther, Spawn (Image, yup, the Character is/was black. Satan made him look like a surfer white guy to screw with him for awhile). There are also lesser known characters like Cloak.

Or you could go to a convention if there was one in your area once a year, which often had people whose business it was to travel around the country with their stock to buy and sell.\n\nFor a while I worked at the 3rd largest comic book store in the world, the Passaic Book Store (which any fan of comics printed in the 60s-80s would recognize from their bright yellow double-page ads in the middle of almost every DC and Marvel comic). What I learned working there blew my mind: comic books are not rare, not even the ones you think are rare.\n\nAside from their storefront they had two warehouses.  I only ever went to one of them, and it was the length of two houses. Inside were custom racks holding [long boxes](http://www.thecomicdoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/comic_book_long_box.jpg) except they weren't laid down on their bottoms, they were standing on their ends (which is better for the books because they're laying flat in the boxes instead of being stood up). The racks had two-tiers, so each row was about 7 feet tall.  There must've been millions of books.\n\nIn each long box they would have 20 or 30 copies of *each* issue. Box One would just be for issues 20-29. Box Two would be issues 30-39, and so on.  And all of them were in **really** nice condition. I'm talking 6 and up. Maybe 7 and up.  So box the first box might have *twenty-thirty copies* of X-Men 20, twenty copies of X-Men 21, thirty copies of X-Men 22, etc.\n\nThen the Internet came, and eBay, and suddenly everyone in every podunk little town from one side of the country to the other could put their comics up for sale.  Supply flooded the market, demand didn't really change, prices plummeted, and many comic stores went out of business (including Passaic Book Center).  The ones that did stay in business usually did so by greatly expanded their inventory of graphic novels and other related items like figurines, shirts, posters, etc.", "id": "d0f8iub"}, {"comment": "If you have any comic book stories that are interesting, we would love for you to do an AMA over at /r/Comicbookcollecting.

I think having a Robin killed had a powerful impact on Batman's character and really helped him evolve at a time when the Bat-verse was shedding the campier elements of its roots. The deadly stakes of Batman's war on crime were brought roaring into the spotlight. The wisdom of bringing a young person into that world was thrown into question, even if only temporarily as Tim Drake entered the picture not too long after. \n\nBut even when Tim became Robin III, it didn't signal that Bruce forgot the lesson of Jason's death. It informed his treatment of Tim, not to mention Spoiler and the many other \"sidekicks\" that have come and gone. It could be argued that it was a factor in Bruce's decision to make Jean-Paul Valley his successor in Knightfall, rather than Dick or Tim, though I don't know if that was explicitly stated.\n\nIt's debatable how much of that was erased when Jason returned as the Red Hood. By that time, there was a veritable army of vigilantes operating in Gotham-- Robin III, Batgirl II, Oracle, Black Canary, Huntress, Spoiler, Azrael, etc. Jason distinguished himself by being willing to break Batman's \"one rule\" and killing criminals, so a new dynamic was born that made for some good stories. Forcing Bruce to actually confront what happened to Jason with the man himself was entirely different than the kind of introspection that his death had caused to that point. \n\nIn the late 1990s, I read an author who said that the three characters that should never be brought back to life in comics were Gwen Stacy, Bucky Barnes, and Jason Todd, precisely because of how much their deaths changed and redefined the protagonists they were most closely associated with. Of course, in the years that followed, all three characters were brought back in one way, shape or form. I guess it's up to each reader to decide whether they think that more was gained than lost by the introduction of Spider-Gwen, the Winter Soldier and the Red Hood.\n\n"], [3, "It's better if you read it in the voice of William Dozier."], [3, "I wonder what would have happened if Jason lived.

They went from him being a Dick clone to \"well, let's make him better than Dick.\" They gave him full adoption almost immediately. And then they made him \"edgy\" by making him angry. If he got grounded for disobeying orders he'd do everything to get around it or be outright hostile to everyone, including Alfred. When he was paired with Barbara Gordon to work on detective skills, his stunning personality meant he was largely dismissive of anyone but Bruce teaching him, much less a girl.\n\nMore than anything his stint as Robin was the anti-Batman. I know a lot of readers love the whole Punisher ethos. Ends justify the means ra ra. It's especially a given with anti-hero characters like Wolverine and Punisher. Jason was in that mold. Very \"the ends justify the means.\" Except that where Batman is the idea of justice by using the law, even though as a vigilante his existence is an affront to the rule of law, Jason completely divorced himself from Batman. Even as Batman's partner. If a criminal died, oh well. Which is a pretty big slap in the face to Batman as a character. \n\nIt has been argued about how Batman killed before, especially in the golden age. But as the character developed, Batman as a vigilante becomes almost this avatar of justice. And justice as a concept, even in mythology, has always been a concept of equanimity among men - the Greeks and Romans had Dike/Justitia, the Norse had Forseti, Babylonians had Shamash and the Egyptians had Maat. The unifying concept for each personification of justice was that for man to have a concept of justice, man needs laws made by men to govern men. And that for justice to exist in mortal society, then men must allow the laws of man to pursue justice. Which is what Batman does. As a vigilante he uses the laws of men to combat the criminal elements in Gotham. He's careful to visit crime scenes after the police, to retain the scene's integrity and sterility (later addition to Batman) and pursue clues that take him parallel to the cops (so that he's not interfering in their cases). \"Ends justify the means\" is a refutation of the concepts of justice and laws.\n\nI guess all that serves as a reflective defense of my decision.

(imo)\n\nOn the other hand, I find Tim to be the most compelling. He's one of the only people to discover who Batman is (and as a kid no less). He's also the detective of the family (or he used to be). To me, that makes him the most Batman like of all the Robins without the annoying lack of smiles and fun. He's the one who had a family and chose to be Robin anyway just because it was necessary. He knew Batman needed one and so he became that. He dealt with living a normal life with his family *and* living the life of a Robin. And when everyone gave up on Bruce, he went against the grain and searched for him anyway (working with villains to do it). Then, when he comes back and finds out he can't be Robin anymore, does he go crazy and start wearing a red fishbowl? no. He accepts Dick's decision and just stays Red Robin and lets Damian be Robin. There's more but, to me, these are the things that make him the best (not to mention the fact that he was the first Robin to have his own ongoing and the stuff with Young Justice and Teen Titans. Did you know he tried to make clones of Bart and Kon when they died? talk about controversial!). \n\n\nBut this is just my stuff.

I think having a Robin killed had a powerful impact on Batman's character and really helped him evolve at a time when the Bat-verse was shedding the campier elements of its roots. The deadly stakes of Batman's war on crime were brought roaring into the spotlight. The wisdom of bringing a young person into that world was thrown into question, even if only temporarily as Tim Drake entered the picture not too long after. \n\nBut even when Tim became Robin III, it didn't signal that Bruce forgot the lesson of Jason's death. It informed his treatment of Tim, not to mention Spoiler and the many other \"sidekicks\" that have come and gone. It could be argued that it was a factor in Bruce's decision to make Jean-Paul Valley his successor in Knightfall, rather than Dick or Tim, though I don't know if that was explicitly stated.\n\nIt's debatable how much of that was erased when Jason returned as the Red Hood. By that time, there was a veritable army of vigilantes operating in Gotham-- Robin III, Batgirl II, Oracle, Black Canary, Huntress, Spoiler, Azrael, etc. Jason distinguished himself by being willing to break Batman's \"one rule\" and killing criminals, so a new dynamic was born that made for some good stories. Forcing Bruce to actually confront what happened to Jason with the man himself was entirely different than the kind of introspection that his death had caused to that point. \n\nIn the late 1990s, I read an author who said that the three characters that should never be brought back to life in comics were Gwen Stacy, Bucky Barnes, and Jason Todd, precisely because of how much their deaths changed and redefined the protagonists they were most closely associated with. Of course, in the years that followed, all three characters were brought back in one way, shape or form. I guess it's up to each reader to decide whether they think that more was gained than lost by the introduction of Spider-Gwen, the Winter Soldier and the Red Hood.\n\n", "id": "d7nr774"}], [{"comment": "It's better if you read it in the voice of William Dozier.", "id": "d7n8za1"}], [{"comment": "I wonder what would have happened if Jason lived.

However Fawcett stopped producing the comics in the 50s, and DC bought the copyright to the Fawcett characters in the 1970s. However because Marvel had obtained the trademark for the name, DC had to promote and produce their comics with another title: Shazam!\n\nEither Fawcett's claim on the trademark expired at some point after they stopped producing the comics, or Marvel made a convincing argument that they should get the trademark from Fawcett (\"we are producing a comic with this title now, they haven't produced a comic with this title for 15 years\") - either way, trademarks and copyright are separated things which is how DC got the copyright but not the trademark.\n\nIt's only been since the New 52 that DC themselves have renamed their character to Shazam, and it's not because of any legal pressure from Marvel.

The lawsuit effectively ended Fawcett publishing Captain Marvel comics, but they kept producing Captain Marvel Jr. comics, as that was different enough that it didn't fall under the lawsuit purview. They published Captain Marvel Jr. into the early 50's.\n\nNow, because the name of Captain Marvel couldn't be used anymore by Fawcett, they let the copyright lapse, and Marvel picked it up in the 60's when they were creating the Kree Captain Mar-Vell (see the spelling), which they wanted to call \"Captain Marvel\".\n\nThen, when DC acquired the Fawcett stable of characters in the early 70's, they got all the characters, but now Marvel had the copyright to the name and they certainly weren't going to let it lapse. So DC could call the character Captain Marvel inside the book, but on covers and anywhere that a copyright tag needs to be applied (such as on products like action figures) they would use \"Shazam!\".

This being the same Superman who originally could only leap over tall buildings and run slightly faster than a speeding bullet, and is pictured in the dictionary next to the term 'power creep'.  Fawcett were a small family owned operation, and couldn't stand up to the giant that was Detective Comics.\n\nSo Fawcett go under and their IPs languish for a decade or two.  In the meantime Marvel decide that 'Captain Marvel' sounds right up their alley and in 1967 launch their own title of that name about an alien warrior who decides to defend the Earth against cosmic forces, against the wishes of his own people (the Kree!  Booo!).  \n\nThen in 1972 DC snap up the rights to the Fawcett properties and several more nasty court cases erupt over who owns the title.

My brother told me to buy it because they're really cool, so I did.  \nI got a card of Nightcrawler in the pack. I had never seen anything so cool before and I was just hooked on the X-Men. I became obsessed with everything X-Men I could find. I got comics and toys and the VHS tapes with the episodes of the 90's X-Men series on them. When the X-Men movie came out (and everybody still thought that comics were lame) I went to the movie by myself. Same for X2 (though I bumped into some guys from high school and hung out with them that time.) Sure, maybe the movies weren't amazing, but it was just so exciting to see these characters I grew up loving finally brought to life.  I kept buying the comics (I must've had 7 - 10 X-Men related comics on my pull list at my \"local\" comic shop that was a half hour drive or an hour bus ride away.)  \nBut slowly, things were changing. Your post really hits the nail on the head. The X-Men aren't really the X-Men anymore. Everybody has changed and not really for the better.

In addition to this, a lot of Deaf people would probably oppose to being cured since they're proud of being Deaf. I think Deaf pride is bullshit and I would take a real cure for deafness anytime.\n\nEducation for the Deaf is severely lacking all around the United States. It enrages me to think about it. It is literally setting up Deaf people to fail in their lives. It's not just English, it's every subject in school including math and history. There are several reasons to why their education is poor. There are quite a few of Deaf students that are Deaf due to another disability or illness which requires special education for them due to mental retardation. The education program revolves around them, so those who are only Deaf will, unfortunately, be taught at several grade levels lower than where they should be. They also lack books, resources, and teachers to teach them what they need to know due to lack of funding from the government. Also keep in mind that teachers at these schools are usually Deaf themselves and attended Deaf schools as well, so you have teachers who also had poorer education teaching these students where it becomes a cycle. Those are probably the top reasons why.\n\nIf it were up to me, I would close all the Deaf schools in the United States and force these Deaf students to attend mainstream public schools where they can get the better education they deserve so they can better succeed in life. Yes, it'll probably affect their Deaf community but sometimes sacrifices are necessary.

You could have four people that all have bilateral profound hearing loss (the diagnosis that general society thinks of when the word deaf is used) for various reasons. Such as, but not limited to: hair cells in the cochlea failing for congenital reasons, hair cells in the cochlea being destroyed by a disease, the cochlea itself being malformed, the auditory nerve developing incorrectly, the auditory nerve not forming in the first place, or other parts of the ear (including the canal/recognizable outer and visible portion) not forming. It's silly for people to be offended by it; but it is a question asking the wrong thing. (Edit: and this does not even begin to scratch the surface of how we learn to hear...so even if we did have some type of biological technology to regrow a missing piece in some of those particular examples, that does not include a time machine to help that person relive their first few months of life when most \"normal\" people actually develop the neurological connections and processes responsible for what we think of as hearing.)\n\nAs far as cochlear implants go (edit: and just to note, they are not physically viable in some of the situations I presented), I do not think they are what you are imagining. They are something, but they are a far, far cry from the acoustic hearing that you and I take for granted. It is not apples and oranges, it is apples and raisins...at best. It might not be best to approach a conversation assuming that your kneejerk reaction to the topic is the correct one. Your initial question displays a high degree of ignorance on the topic, and based on 8 comments from a random internet message board, you are ready to declare \"that [the people that view the world differently from me] are all morons.\" That's not to say that everyone who has replied to you has a particularly strong position philosophically, morally, or otherwise.

It's like claiming The Joker isn't a terrorist because he was going to leave one of the ferries alive. It's about the context and the idea, not the 5 second interlude between incredible urban destruction.\n\n>Or how most of the deaths were caused by the world engine, which got evacuations going in an obviously 9/11-like horrifically tragic scenario where there would definitely be casualties?\n\nWhich is why it's even weirder how unfazed Superman is by all of it. I'm not saying no one should've died. I'm saying he should have given a shit, at least as much as he cared about killing Zod. \n\nLike, Superman goes to stop the World Engine in the middle of nowhere first while Zod goes to ravage Metropolis. Why is that even part of the plot? To give a thin reason for Superman to not be around so that we can get some wholesale destruction of Metropolis and hit some disaster porn checkmarks. It's dumb.\n\n>Or how you never actually saw any of these supposed Clark-responsible deaths on screen, leaving the option of looking at from an optimist perspective open to anyone \n\n>maybe production staff were real people with real respect for the character and pride in their work?\n\nFirst of all, if \"made by real people with pride in their work\" is all you need for a film to be immune to criticism, then nothing is ever bad. Secondly, we're talking about Zack Snyder, [who when giving his thoughts on superheroes in 2008 said](http://screencrush.com/zack-snyder-watchmen-interview-batman-superman/):  \n\n>The Marvel universe has gone nuts; we\u2019re going to have a fricking Captain America movie if we\u2019re not careful.\"\n\n\n>If Superman grabbed your arm and pulled really hard, he\u2019d pull your arm out of your socket. That\u2019s the thing you don\u2019t see in a Superman movie. But in Watchmen, what you get is, like, \u201dI\u2019m a Superman, and I really want to help mankind \u2014 but I just tore this guy in half by accident.\n\nAnd, having found no use for Jimmy Olsen in the movies, decided to just kill him off for a cheap thrill right away:\n\n>\u201cWe just did it as this little aside because we had been tracking where we thought the movies were gonna go, and we don\u2019t have room for Jimmy Olsen in our big pantheon of characters, but we can have fun with him, right?\u201d\n>\u201cI thought, if it were Jesse Eisenberg and he got out and he goes, \u2018I\u2019m Jimmy Olsen,\u2019 you\u2019d be like, oh my God, we\u2019re gonna have Jimmy Olsen in the whole movie, right?\u2019\u201d Snyder says. \u201cAnd then if he got shot, you\u2019d just be like, \u2018What!? You can\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat's not a guy with the same tone as the Superman character. He'd probably make a good director The Authority or Irredeemable, though.\n\nThe fact that the actual collateral damage and human cost of his fighting is left off-screen is _exactly the point_. It means the filmmakers aren't even thinking of it as a thing of any consequence. They just want it to look cool with major destruction. The filmmakers don't think it matters, Superman hardly notices it, and everything is picture perfect in the next scene. If an entire city being leveled doesn't have any consequences, then what are the stakes in the story?\n\nEither Superman vs. Zod has to factor in Superman finding a way to do minimal damage to the world, _as it happens all the time in most comics and cartoons and fucking Dragonball Z_, or it has to be the knockdown drag-out brawl that it was, but centered around Superman's regret that it had to come to this and realization of the consequences of his powers.\n\nInstead, the filmmakers went, \"fuck it\" and left everything to the suspension of disbelief as if everyone would give it a pass because it's just dumb action. It was cartoonish, consequence-free destruction that all of the characters shrugged off.\n\nThey know how to do it because they did it when he kills Zod. They create the unwinnable situation, they spend a long time cutting between Zod's laser and the terrified family, they create suspense and show Superman struggling with his decision. He lets out a scream after he does it. Here's how they would've treated that scene if they did it the same way they did the destruction of Metropolis: Zod turns and notices a family.

Now that I'm older and understand the world (and how dark as hell reality truly is), I'm enjoying psychological thrillers, lots of comedy, and even long epic adventure story arcs.\n\nI think that a large number of us must pass through our angry nihilist phase at some point, and the media we consume during that time tends to dance just past the edge of our comfort zone.  I think it's psychologically gratifying to read someone else's narrative in peeling back delicate veneer of pleasantness painted over modern society, quickly unveiling the true and honest filth lying below.  I think this shared revelation felt enlightening, and at one time, reinforced my pessimistic world view.  Some of us go dark with our fiction because of traumatic experience, but sometimes it's simply angst, but it's something many people go through.  Many never do.  This can be, again, because of trauma, but contrary to that, it could be due to privilege that one simply doesn't identify with rebellion.  I definitely had a dark and gritty phase (for reasons), and identfied \n\nBut now... the real-life stories of oppressed people (both here in my home country as well as in desperately impoverished regions of our small planet) and especially true tales of abject cruelty to young children, seem to dwarf the fiction.  Through becoming more of a part of the wider world and opening my eyes and heart to the tragedies that surround me, I find myself developing a great appreciation for heroism, virtuous sacrifice, and great enjoyment in tales of hard-won redemption.  My escapism in fiction helps recharge my optimism.\n\nPart of this is that I'm also a parent of a small child, and I have to believe that there is some way I can equip my kid with the tools needed to become physically, intellectually, and emotionally strong, despite such strong forces pushing against our most vulnerable.  I know that mine has a strong advantage, having myself and my partner as kind, understanding, supportive and non-judgemental parents, but that's not enough.  On some level, media comes in and influences a young person, both for better or worse, and thusly totally innocent childrens comics (Action Lab, Hero Cats, Muppets, and to an extent, Lockjaw, Scooby-Doo Team-Up, etc.) have a place, one that I never valued in any way until parenthood.\n\nSo, I'm glad that books exist along the spectrum of emotional corruption, from nihilistic true grit, to pure earnest fun.  Good comic book fans support their artists and avoid denigrating others because of their preferences;  they will share what they like with a new audience that they think will enjoy it, and avoid zeigeist group-think.  So, no, disliking part or all of an authors work (regardless of how critically acclaimed they may be) does not affect your comic-fan-good-ness!\n\nNow, there is the possibility that you (and I, it appears) may simply have poor taste in comic fiction, and, well... that just has to be OK, I guess :-P", "id": "d720fp4"}, {"comment": "[Here's a picture of him from 1985.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FJlZUpgXQJI/hqdefault.jpg)\n\nThat's just sort of how Alan Moore looks.", "id": "d6z1kce"}, {"comment": "Does he know it's [1985](http://i.imgur.com/l9Z5brE.jpg)?", "id": "d6z6ae8"}, {"comment": "Little sad this wasn't a link to 1985 - Bowling for Soup", "id": "d6z7odj"}, {"comment": "[Just for you.](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)", "id": "d6zincs"}, {"comment": "Robin Williams was Pagliacci", "id": "d6zbng1"}, {"comment": "That's just the power of sorcery coursing in his veins.", "id": "d6yuqjm"}, {"comment": "He's sick.

She's a deconstruction of an archetype, not an archetype played straight. \n\nWatchmen - There's one attempted rape, but it's not used for shock factor, nor is it exploitative or leery. It's used as the catalyst of a complex backstory for three very layered characters, two of whom are women. It's probably one of the most nuanced analyses of the fallout of sexual assault I've seen - look at Laurie's reaction when she finds out who her real father is. That the Comedian and Sally Jupiter ended up having an affair is never portrayed as a sunshine and rainbows \"he raped her but now they love each other so it's okay!\" situation, it's shown as being messy and full of bitterness, resentment and regret and yet at the same time, heartbreak.\n\nOne of my main problems with Snyder's Watchmen is that it completely misreads Laurie as a character - Laurie laments to Nite Owl at one point about how she was expected to wear a sexy costume (\"All that tight latex... It was awful). She's, again, a deconstruction of feminine archetypes, this time the idea of the bimbo superheroine in the sexualized costume who's mostly there for eye candy. What does Snyder use her for? Sexualized eye candy.\n\nHalo Jones is a completely independent woman who breaks free of her depressing, poverty stricken existence to try and find a purpose in life. She travels the universe. She joins the army. She becomes a bounty hunter. She is only once involved in anything sexual, and it's a consensual scene with not a single leery or hypersexualised panel in it.\n\nMiracleman has a graphically depicted birth scene that is partly a direct attack on how sterilized media protrayals of birth and pregnancy often are. It's messy and gory and full on and there's no sexiness about it in the slightest. The character giving birth, Liz Moran, is also more than just a woman-in-trouble stereotype. The arc that leads to her leaving her husband, Miracleman/Mike Moran, is utterly heartbreaking and it's the husband who is the one left distraught and helpless, with Mike Moran effectively committing suicide by asking Miracleman never to transform back into him (it's a Shazam-esque situation with two characters with different personalities inhabiting the same body)\n\nNone of these women get murdered, only one suffers an attempted rape and only one other is threatened with rape.\n\nThese are all very nuanced portrayals of women in my opinion, although they are not flaweless (V for Vendetta, for example, fails a little in that for all Evey's striving for independence, it still requires a man for a catalyst; also, only Halo Jones passes the Bechdel Test). However, I don't see these flaws as attributable to misogyny, they're well meant narrative choices that were misread by the writer. I think it's very unfair to say he wasn't interested in writing strong women.\n\nI have a problem with fetishistic rape scenes in comics and any other media, but as Moore has said on many occasions, he's trying to present a real world with all its horrors and one of those horrors is sexual abuse. It may be something that happens too often for some people, but in Moore's work it's never leery or exploitative.", "id": "d6za53g"}]]], "5956ej": ["How comic books are made", "2016-10-24 19:41:36", 11160, "https://i.redd.it/xi1rtyjszftx.jpg", [[372, "[deleted]"], [264, "As someone new to comics (started with DC Rebirth), this is helpful.

I personally believe that when it comes to that sort of thing the person who can do the job should get the job and all the other silliness is just that. But I do always wonder if someone is trying to slip a message in when they do something like this and put a woman into a job, in an industry, that everyone knows they have had a very tough time getting into and staying long enough to make an impact. \n\nAs I said, I believe all that matters is if you can do the job. So I'm not personally commenting on the issue at all. That said the conflicts over women being pushed out of comics and also having a harder time getting in (only to be pushed out) have been recent and very public.

The English were renowned for their use of the longbow (which they ~~stole~~ borrowed from the Welsh).  At the battle of Agincourt the French commander threatened to cut off the middle finger of any archer that fought against him.  In defiance the English presented their middle fingers to the opposing lord.  And from that it became a general sign of defiance or disdain.  But, if this story is true it was probably actually the V sign that was used which to my knowledge is a more traditional British obscene gesture.  However, even that sign isn't attested to more than a few hundred years and we have no evidence that it was in use anytime close to the Battle of Agincourt (1415).  And there is no historical evidence of the French threat or the English making any gesture.\n\nAnd lastly for the middle finger it has been used as an insult as far back as ancient Greece.  It essentially was meant to imply that the recipient was a passive recipient of traditional Greek male bonding.

Which would you find more discomforting and make the film harder to watch? Joker simply handing Gordon the pictures of Barbra naked and wounded, or a scene that actually depicts the Joker raping Barbra where the camera focuses on the terror and helplessness in her eyes during the assault (similar to how they handled Jason's realization that he was going to die in Under the Red Hood)?\n\n>  I find with depicting a truly graphic scene, you can jump from terrifying or horrifying to just disgusting, which I don't feel stays as long.\n\nAgreed. It all depends on how well the scene is handled. It'd be like the difference between the rape in Rob Zombie's Halloween (the unrated cut) and the rape in American History X. The former is just disgusting and didn't help the film at all, while the latter is an intense and emotional scene that makes watching that portion of the film very difficult.\n\nEDIT: For the record, I'm not making an argument for just adding a rape scene, just that they can be done well and a well done rape scene can add a lot more emotional impact than an implied rape we never see.

The Joker should be portrayed, IMO, as an evil, insane, chaotic criminal. What he shouldn't be, however, is anything more than a deranged man. That's why I thought Endgame was so awful. It cast the Joker in a supernatural, almost all powerful light. He took down the Justice League for fucks sake. The Jokers advantage is that he is immune to Batman's greatest weapon: fear. Not that he can survive bullets to the chest or pull off impossibly complex crimes and traps right under the nose of the world's greatest detective. Granted, I think him being in love with Harley was a pretty big betrayal of the character.", "id": "d6ov2lr"}, {"comment": "And yet by the end of Endgame it was revealed that he wasn't his immortal clown, he was just screwing with Batman and Gordon as part of his game. He just got lucky with the Dyonesium and was able to com back from the brink. \n\nOverall the whole thing wasn't as good as it could have been but I thought it continued to explore the relationship between Joker and Batman and continued to put out that Joker was just a man who wanted to be elevated to something mythic with the Batman and in death he succeeded. \n\nI mean that didn't stick (never does) but I thought it was fascinating.", "id": "d6pccq0"}, {"comment": "Have you seen BTAS? That for me is the joker at his purest. And leto is that but much darker and grown up. Joker is, at his core, a thug. He's a thief with a gang that is also a murderous, random, psychopath dressed as a clown with a bat obsession. In the comics he has ran a mob and owned nightclubs. Leto portrayed that. This philosophical force of nature shit seems to have arrived from Ledger's joker which was a great and different take on the villian, but was still essentially a murderous, psychopathic, unpredictable, thug-clown... with a gang. Leto met all those qualifications and more. The issue was the way he was put into the film and how much we saw of him. Either way, these characters have to move forward, Batman used to kill people and supes used to not be able to fly and Tim Burton made joker kill Bruce's parents. (Side note: that joker was the epitome of a gangster) People need to understand the difference between something being done differently vs something being done bad. \n\nWe didn't see enough of this joker to warrant saying they have a fundamental misunderstanding of the character. And don't get me started on Bats and Supes. Regardless, Geoff Johns is in charge of DC films going forward and if you try and say he misunderstands these characters anything you say will be invalid because Rebirth is dope.", "id": "d6p1adt"}, {"comment": "Yeah and Superman isn't from Russian but there is a story where he is.

That's why it's such an acclaimed story. People appreciate that a Superman born and raised in the USSR can still be a recognisable character.\n\nConversely, nobody remembers the Batman vampire stories because like who gives a shit, it's just Batman as a vampire.\n\nTrying a new take on a character is fine, but you have to keep the main facets of the character. Think of something like BBC's Sherlock - it's set in the modern era, there are lots of changes, but Sherlock is still an edgy and cantankerous drug addict with a genius intellect. But if you want to change what fundamentally makes a character memorable, you might as well just invent a new character.

But the thing I like about Limitless is the one gimmick they never seem to talk about. And if you're thinking about watching Limitless stop reading now because I may get a little spoilerish. \n\nBrian Finch is only on NZT half the time. And he struggles with the more human side of himself and the god he becomes on the drug. There is even an episode where Bradley Cooper's Senator Morra puts it to him that he doesn't understand Brian's struggle with doing the right thing strategically, or for the greater good, versus doing what he thinks is morally right. Brian Finch uses NZT every day and every day for twelve hours he becomes more than human but each night he has to struggle with the disparity between what he would do on NZT, how it changes him, and the human person that Brian Finch is off of the drug. Cooper's Morra seems to have lost all of his humanity. Brian Finch is clinging desperately to his in an attempt to inform the god he becomes when on NZT. \n\nNot to mention that around episode five or so of the season the actor playing Brian Finch just seemed to start having fun. And as soon as he did the rest of the cast did as well and everything started getting better. To the point where I'd say it's some of the most creative police procedural stuff I've seen in a very long time... and I was around when the first Law and Order started... and I've been watching it ever since. \n\nAlmost any show can get by with halfway decent writing if the actors are having fun. In fact the only reason I've watched the first few episodes of Lucifer is because the main star is such a ham, chewing up scenery like a wood chipper. He's glorious in that respect. But the show is preposterous. And most of the rest of the cast hasn't quite caught his infectious charm yet. And unlike Limitless Lucifer is, absolutely, a by the numbers police procedural. \n\nBut I do think the writing on Limitless is superior. And watching Brian Finch, a god for half his life, caught in a Faustian bargain with other gods and making the best of it while struggling to see the small picture as clearly as the big one is something I haven't seen before in my 45 years of watching TV.

Specificall the aforementioned *Song of The South* which is a highly racist portrayal of southern culture that nonetheless won Disney acclaim and spawned multiple songs and characters that Disney uses to this day (Zipity Do Da, the characters in the log flume ride, etc.) but that disney refuses to republish or even acknowledge the film due to it's racially charged nature. \n\nWarner Bros meanwhile chose to publish the loony toons catalogue in its unedited entirety including multiple highly racist portrayals of blacks and japanese dating to the 50's and earlier, especially certain cartoons created as WWII propaganda. When they did this, they included a warning and explanation at the start stating that while the material was not in line with modern sensibilities and was indeed offensive in a modern context, to attempt to remove it from the record would be to deny that the transgression had occurred, and that that was unacceptable hypocrisy.\n\nWhether or not the new Flintstones comics fit the same criteria, is up for debate, but to flatly state that there is no discussion to be had on the subject is just as, if not more offensive to many than the offensive material contained in the original works. Moreover, it is worrying to some, to see such symbols used so interchangeably, as if the content has no meaning, only the skin that it wears matters.\n\nFinally anyone who grew up watching the flinstones (as I did) will look at this and find it to be ridiculously absurd, imagine trying to use spongebob to address the syrian civil war or female genital mutilation or aparthied, that's what it feels like if you grew up watching the original cartoons.", "id": "d8j0ebs"}, {"comment": "Not arguing your first point, but you're a bit late for this since reinventing old characters and properties and using mature themes in them has been a thing since decades.

Isn't that what everyone's been calling you on, and the practice you have been defending? Yes, it is. \n\nActually, I'm drawing my conclusions based on many years of independent research. I am by no means an authority, but I am not just pulling shit out of my ass either.\n\nYou can infer a lot of how pre-colonial Americans lived based on the records of how they lived after. Sure, 'Western' influence certainly dramatically changed how they lived, but it didn't happen overnight.\n\n> We do, however, have record of how Native American tribes conducted competition, and it was not peaceful.\n\nI didn't say that they were a bunch of granola crunching peacenicks who had love-ins and dropped acid. I said they lived in ***relative*** peace and harmony, and by an large that is absolutely true.\n\nDid some native tribes do some things that we would consider barbaric? Sure they did. You could likely look at just about any culture that ever existed and point out some flaws.\n\nYou know what they didn't do though? What you inferred in your OP. They didn't ban homosexuality because they needed every single member so they could 'wipe their neighbors off the map.'\n\nEven the more viscous tribes that treated their neighbors 'like a resource' wouldn't deplete their resource by murdering them all.\n\nLand was in abundance in pre-colonial America, there was really no need to annihilate your neighbors. Even the brutal early civilizations wouldn't risk life and limb because they simply didn't like their neighbors. They did it because they wanted, needed their land.\n\nSure, sometimes conflicts arose among the tribes, but as often they would strive to cooperate and coexist peacefully. They formed political alliances, such as Iroquois Confederacy. They developed trade languages and engaged in trade and cultural exchange with their neighbors. \n\nYes, other tribes *were* a resource. Unless you wanted your tribe to be inbred you needed to have cultural exchange with others in one form or another. Sometimes  you invited your neighboring tribe to come to festivities at your tribe and you could meet people not related to you there. If that didn't work you might have to resort to kidnapping.\n\nThe difference between that and say the Israelites is that they would murder every man in the conflict and steal ALL the women. When they were feeling merciful, they would only enslave all the men and steal all the women. You may not see this as a huge difference but in practice the difference is in fact huge.\n\n>They often treated settled peoples like another resource, just as pastoral societies often did in the Old World.\n\nI thought we were past this, I wasn't making any sort of statement about 'pastoral societies'. The tribe I referenced in my OP was one, but that isn't really relevant. Most tribes were hunter gatherers.\n\nYou know who else treats other people like a resource? Every 'civilized' society that has ever existed. \n\nThe modern form of agriculture that was invented in the neolithic revolution was *very* efficient, (it's how we can feed 7.5 billion people with only a tiny fraction of people being farmers). It *always* produces a surplus of food.\n\nWhen you have a surplus of food in a population, you end up with a surplus of individuals. Once you had that  you have a real problem. At this point your options are limited. You could start performing ritual human sacrifices, as *many* agricultural societies have done, or you create an army and take more land.\n\nNative Americans simply didn't ever have this necessity (again except for Maya, Aztec etc). I am not saying they were somehow superior people. They were people, just as flawed as any other, but their lifestyle certainly led to far less murder, war and subjugation than typically happens in 'civilized' societies. (On the whole, exceptions can be made for both groups)\n\nHere's something neither of us need to speculate on, there were hundreds of nations of  people living in the Americas before Colombass arrived, who had been here for many thousands of years. Half a century later how many are there?\n\nDo you honestly think that the only reason that Native Americans 'lost the war' for this land was simply due to technology? In your view millions of blood thirsty savages intent on wiping everyone else off the map weren't able to stop a few men with shitty muskets? \n\nDon't you think it's more plausible that they didn't even realize that there was a war until it was too late? That they didn't even posses the concept of 'War' as we know it? That they never would have dreamed that these newcomers would desire to wipe every one of THEM off the map and completely take over the land, because they had never experienced anything like it? \n\nThe Americans beat the British because they had learned to utilize the type of 'Guerrilla warfare' that natives used on them. If the natives had been bent on conquest like you claim, the Europeans likely wouldn't have made it off their boats.\n\nInstead the first group who met with Columbus did so with open arms, and he repaid them by enslaving them.\n\nThat's what civilizations do, conquer territory. It's only in the last century, after wiping all the tribes from the map (and before the revolution, every society on earth was tribal) that we (for the most part) started frowning on stealing the land of the people we conquer. Now we just pound them into submission and let them 'keep' their land.", "id": "d8jlx8q"}], [{"comment": "What a shitty, ridiculous retcon. Fred would never show that kind of compassion.

One of the things I dislike the most about Snyder's film was his portrayal of Superman's family. The Kents in MOS were bad influences to Clark. They would never say anything to Clark to have such a negative outlook on life.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nLkqXeq.jpg\n\nAnother thing I disliked was that damn tornado scene. Ugghh! Clark should've just saved his dad from the tornado. He's fast enough to be imperceptible to the human eye, and can totally move at that speed without harming the nearby environment.  https://youtu.be/VlINHSnUx9k?t=2m26s\n\nAnd besides,  what was the point of that scene, anyway? It did nothing to support the narrative of the film. All it showed was how, both from fear of being exposed and his super abilities, he has to be met with the fact, that sometimes he has no way to save everyone. What should've happen is that his dad should've died from like a heart attack or something. This way it tells the viewer that with all his superpowers, sometimes he has no way to save everyone.\n\n And if your going to put that in the movie, at least make another scene/moment calling back to the decision Clark made earlier. I mean, if we can presume that based on his father's death and Superman's decision to not save him, Clark become further hesitant to become Superman(and even a happy Clark) lets see that change in his opinion of being Superman happen in the film. Have him later realize his decision to save not one, but now, everyone on the planet, would affirm both his and both his parents belief that, though his identity as Superman is a responsibility he cannot escape, all his choices will benefit humanity on a grand scale. So the world seeing him save the world will make them less inclined to be fearful of him. This would embody the story's message and provide a hopeful ending.\n\nAnd that's perhaps my biggest gripe with the film, which was the tone and message. The theme is about hope, yet he is forced into a hopeless situation. That's just bad writing. Superman should make the choice to kill Zod, even when he does have another option.https://youtu.be/jUORL-bvwA0?t=42s\nOr if that doesn't work, at least come up with something, anything really, to get Superman out of that \"lose-lose\" bind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA5d66AnT7s\nAnything at all, really. https://youtu.be/TjgsnWtBQm0?t=1m\n\nIf I would've wrote the story, I would have constantly woven in the fact, that Clark, being from two worlds, had different lessons to learn from each world and upbringing. I would let one side of him understand his power and speak to him in a very straight forward and rigid way, expressing to him the large responsibility to lead an entire world to do better things. Then make the other side seem a little more fallible, and I don't know, human. They would somehow instill in him their individual concerns and beliefs and the concept of choice, which he would blend with his understanding of his primary goal of helping people. Then, after he kills Zod, he should still strive to do something he wants. Maybe have him meet with a general of the military and discuss that he wants to do things on his own terms.\n\n Then have a scene of him doing something else, maybe like his personal interest, that would both help people and allow him to be an individual.

Snyder has a massive hard on for playing up the inhumanity in Superman because he thinks that's the coolest aspect of the character. In BvS and MoS there's just scene after scene of Superman ALLOWING himself to be controlled by lesser beings and the resulting resentment of these artificial constraints. See: the passive aggressive attack on the truck driver scene in MoS or the courtroom scene in BvS. I laughed at Johnathan's death scene because it was a ludicrous premise and in retrospect I've come to appreciate my initial reaction more and more. \n\nThis is a terrible way to handle Superman. There's only so far you can play up the Objectivist aspect of the character without succumbing to the issues inherent in the ideology. In Snyder's world Superman isn't a member of the community who stands up for what's right. He's a paradoxically self interested hero that hates and loves people in equal measure. I swear to god it seems like the only reason he saves people is because his parents told him to and because he wants to bang Lois Lane without it being considered rape. Even the villain in MoS isn't a threat to mankind so much as a threat to Superman himself. The final battle proceeds with a reckless disregard for humanity, as if to say none of it matters and Superman's godlike power is being ultimately unleashed on everyone after years of repression by society.

One of the things I dislike the most about Snyder's film was his portrayal of Superman's family. The Kents in MOS were bad influences to Clark. They would never say anything to Clark to have such a negative outlook on life.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nLkqXeq.jpg\n\nAnother thing I disliked was that damn tornado scene. Ugghh! Clark should've just saved his dad from the tornado. He's fast enough to be imperceptible to the human eye, and can totally move at that speed without harming the nearby environment.  https://youtu.be/VlINHSnUx9k?t=2m26s\n\nAnd besides,  what was the point of that scene, anyway? It did nothing to support the narrative of the film. All it showed was how, both from fear of being exposed and his super abilities, he has to be met with the fact, that sometimes he has no way to save everyone. What should've happen is that his dad should've died from like a heart attack or something. This way it tells the viewer that with all his superpowers, sometimes he has no way to save everyone.\n\n And if your going to put that in the movie, at least make another scene/moment calling back to the decision Clark made earlier. I mean, if we can presume that based on his father's death and Superman's decision to not save him, Clark become further hesitant to become Superman(and even a happy Clark) lets see that change in his opinion of being Superman happen in the film. Have him later realize his decision to save not one, but now, everyone on the planet, would affirm both his and both his parents belief that, though his identity as Superman is a responsibility he cannot escape, all his choices will benefit humanity on a grand scale. So the world seeing him save the world will make them less inclined to be fearful of him. This would embody the story's message and provide a hopeful ending.\n\nAnd that's perhaps my biggest gripe with the film, which was the tone and message. The theme is about hope, yet he is forced into a hopeless situation. That's just bad writing. Superman should make the choice to kill Zod, even when he does have another option.https://youtu.be/jUORL-bvwA0?t=42s\nOr if that doesn't work, at least come up with something, anything really, to get Superman out of that \"lose-lose\" bind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA5d66AnT7s\nAnything at all, really. https://youtu.be/TjgsnWtBQm0?t=1m\n\nIf I would've wrote the story, I would have constantly woven in the fact, that Clark, being from two worlds, had different lessons to learn from each world and upbringing. I would let one side of him understand his power and speak to him in a very straight forward and rigid way, expressing to him the large responsibility to lead an entire world to do better things. Then make the other side seem a little more fallible, and I don't know, human. They would somehow instill in him their individual concerns and beliefs and the concept of choice, which he would blend with his understanding of his primary goal of helping people. Then, after he kills Zod, he should still strive to do something he wants. Maybe have him meet with a general of the military and discuss that he wants to do things on his own terms.\n\n Then have a scene of him doing something else, maybe like his personal interest, that would both help people and allow him to be an individual.

I don't want to see what an ordinary guy would do with Supes' powers because it'd probably be disturbing or depressing. \n\nSuperman is the best of us as a species incarnate and it's compelling to see how someone so powerful can also be so human. Violence, action, and destruction are easy themes because they're present in so much of modern film and fiction in general but adapting the more important tenets of Superman's character could have made for something much more interesting.

We still see a ton of unnecessary damage to the city during this fight, and it ends with Superman killing Zod. Now, Supes killed Zod in the comics, so that's in character for him. The issue is that when he originally did it, he had no options left to stop Zod. In the film, he could have done anything other than limply asking Zod to not incinerate that family. There is no way Zod's neck is stronger than both of Superman's arms, and even if Superman for some reason was unable to just keep Zod's head from reaching that family, he could have covered his eyes, he could have flown him out of the station, he could have forced his head to the ground... instead, he just murders him, screams once, and is immediately over it.

Which is cool, a younger generation might enjoy it more and that's all good. It looks entertaining, but is very much an MCU, focus tested version of Spider-Man.

The Wait, What? podcast brought up a really good point a few months ago that the idea of a platonic, high school aged Peter is kind of made up. He was only in high school very briefly in the comics. I know Ultimate was focused around him in school, but he majority of the mythos comes from Peter being an adult, struggling to make rent and shit like that.\n\nThem funneling down prominent Spider-Man supporting cast into high school students is emblematic of their desire to paint this version of him as a goofy high school student as opposed to the Everyman his character is more often defined as. I guess I also prefer Spider-Man as more or less of an adult next to the avengers, and not a kid who gets fingers waves in his face. \n\nI'll most likely see it, but I think it's a bit of a skewing of Spider-Man in order to better fit him into the MCU."], [34, "It feels a lot like a high-school/superhero movie hybrid. its neat. \n\nedit: it does feel a lot like the Amazing Spider-man films tho...."], [34, "BTW, there's also an [international trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPUASeS6qc0) that offers some new footage (Shocker is in this one) and is cut differently."], [30, "The actor who plays Ned Leeds reminds me more of Ganke Lee, Miles Morale's friend.

I was first introduced to him through the 90s cartoon series, I started picking up comics and never looked back. I have a Spider-man tattoo that I love. I want nothing more than this movie to be the best absolute Spider-man movie it can be, but despite how much I want to be excited for it, I just haven't been able to.\n\nI think I realized the biggest thing that separates this from the way the other movies have been advertised is what they have included in said advertisements. For both the original Raimi Films and Webb's Amazing Spider-man series we were treated to a tease of Spider-man in action, from the first person web swinging and aerial acrobatics, to shots that look like they could have come right out of the comic. Here it has felt a lot more as if they are just advertising the connection to Tony Stark, and this sort of awkward personality they are building up for Holland's portrayal.\n\nA lot of people excited for the movie (and don't get me wrong I am excited too), have been raving about how close this Peter is to the comics. In the 616 comics Peter was only in High School, ages 15-17 in stories published in '63 and '64. The only other take on Peter's character in High School was in Bendis' Ultimate Spider-man run. Maybe I just gained a different interpretation of the latter, but Peter's character was written to hit on a few key notes; he's a loner, he's an enthusiastic scientist, and after his Uncle's death he carries the weight of the world and responsibility on his shoulders. The things I loved about Peter's character is that he is adaptive, relying as much on his intelligence and willpower as on his abilities, and that he can be both light hearted and joking while also internalizing the weight of his responsibility.\n\nFrom what we've seen in Civil War and the advertisements so far they did hit on some notes, Parker did invent his webshooters after all and did express the seriousness of his commitment to fighting crime in the wake of his Uncle's death. The quips in combat have been funny. It's just that something has felt off with some of his portrayal in the trailers, and the way he acts around Stark. I know people say, \"that's how a teenager would act around their hero!\" but Peter isn't a typical teenager. He's not someone who would follow Stark around like a puppy. It does irritate me that it seems that any ingenuity in tech they give to Peter in this movie is a direct result of Stark, rather Peter relying on his own capabilities.\n\nI was worried it would happen with his inclusion in the greater MCU but they are just treating Peter like a sidekick, like the typical teen hero schtick. Spider-man as a character became popular because he was different than the teen heroes in comics at the time, he wasn't a sidekick, he wasn't someone that needed to be protected. He carved out his own path, learning from tragedy and experience. Even in the Ultimate comics, it showed the hard fought path to become a hero, struggling by himself. Having Stark fill a mentor role is one thing but it really feels like they are diminishing aspects of Peter for the benefit of making Stark look better.\n\nI don't want the doting teen trying to live up to some mentor figure. I don't want the focus group tested, this is what teenagers like nowadays, character. I don't want a Peter Parker whose purpose is to espouse how cool Tony Stark is. I want the the brilliant young scientist who is fiercely independent, devoted to his responsibility, and constantly getting back up on his feet in the face of hardship.\n\nMaybe my initial impressions are wrong, maybe I'm just one of those fans who looks to deeply at things for fear of them being ruined. I want more than anything to be hyped about this movie and excited like everyone else. I know I'm going to be there at the midnight premier decked in red and blue. I've accepted and loved a lot of changes they've made to the MCU movies (except for not using Hank Pym, I'm still bitter about that), but I just sincerely hope they don't turn Spider-man into another tool to show off Tony Stark as the \"real star\" of the MCU.\n\nThis trailer instead seemed to highlight two things, advertising the teen movie aspect and RDJs inclusion. It doesn't feel like they're advertising a Spider-man movie. It almost feels like if you swapped out Peter with another teen hero we would've gotten the same trailer."], [4, "As someone who went to public school in Queens from elementary school through high school, it is fucking awesome to see the diversity accurately represented.

I was first introduced to him through the 90s cartoon series, I started picking up comics and never looked back. I have a Spider-man tattoo that I love. I want nothing more than this movie to be the best absolute Spider-man movie it can be, but despite how much I want to be excited for it, I just haven't been able to.\n\nI think I realized the biggest thing that separates this from the way the other movies have been advertised is what they have included in said advertisements. For both the original Raimi Films and Webb's Amazing Spider-man series we were treated to a tease of Spider-man in action, from the first person web swinging and aerial acrobatics, to shots that look like they could have come right out of the comic. Here it has felt a lot more as if they are just advertising the connection to Tony Stark, and this sort of awkward personality they are building up for Holland's portrayal.\n\nA lot of people excited for the movie (and don't get me wrong I am excited too), have been raving about how close this Peter is to the comics. In the 616 comics Peter was only in High School, ages 15-17 in stories published in '63 and '64. The only other take on Peter's character in High School was in Bendis' Ultimate Spider-man run. Maybe I just gained a different interpretation of the latter, but Peter's character was written to hit on a few key notes; he's a loner, he's an enthusiastic scientist, and after his Uncle's death he carries the weight of the world and responsibility on his shoulders. The things I loved about Peter's character is that he is adaptive, relying as much on his intelligence and willpower as on his abilities, and that he can be both light hearted and joking while also internalizing the weight of his responsibility.\n\nFrom what we've seen in Civil War and the advertisements so far they did hit on some notes, Parker did invent his webshooters after all and did express the seriousness of his commitment to fighting crime in the wake of his Uncle's death. The quips in combat have been funny. It's just that something has felt off with some of his portrayal in the trailers, and the way he acts around Stark. I know people say, \"that's how a teenager would act around their hero!\" but Peter isn't a typical teenager. He's not someone who would follow Stark around like a puppy. It does irritate me that it seems that any ingenuity in tech they give to Peter in this movie is a direct result of Stark, rather Peter relying on his own capabilities.\n\nI was worried it would happen with his inclusion in the greater MCU but they are just treating Peter like a sidekick, like the typical teen hero schtick. Spider-man as a character became popular because he was different than the teen heroes in comics at the time, he wasn't a sidekick, he wasn't someone that needed to be protected. He carved out his own path, learning from tragedy and experience. Even in the Ultimate comics, it showed the hard fought path to become a hero, struggling by himself. Having Stark fill a mentor role is one thing but it really feels like they are diminishing aspects of Peter for the benefit of making Stark look better.\n\nI don't want the doting teen trying to live up to some mentor figure. I don't want the focus group tested, this is what teenagers like nowadays, character. I don't want a Peter Parker whose purpose is to espouse how cool Tony Stark is. I want the the brilliant young scientist who is fiercely independent, devoted to his responsibility, and constantly getting back up on his feet in the face of hardship.\n\nMaybe my initial impressions are wrong, maybe I'm just one of those fans who looks to deeply at things for fear of them being ruined. I want more than anything to be hyped about this movie and excited like everyone else. I know I'm going to be there at the midnight premier decked in red and blue. I've accepted and loved a lot of changes they've made to the MCU movies (except for not using Hank Pym, I'm still bitter about that), but I just sincerely hope they don't turn Spider-man into another tool to show off Tony Stark as the \"real star\" of the MCU.\n\nThis trailer instead seemed to highlight two things, advertising the teen movie aspect and RDJs inclusion. It doesn't feel like they're advertising a Spider-man movie. It almost feels like if you swapped out Peter with another teen hero we would've gotten the same trailer.", "id": "dazh0o3"}], [{"comment": "As someone who went to public school in Queens from elementary school through high school, it is fucking awesome to see the diversity accurately represented.

Which makes sense he is the actual hero who wants to save hells kitchen and he is the first one of them all. Jessica Jones on the other had was much smaller in scale. Jessica was powerful but Kill Grave was more powerful but his motivations were much more personal so it had high stakes in terms of characters but not in terms of the overall netflix TV universe which worked great.\n\nNow you have Luke Cage who is just as if not more powerful than Daredevil and Jessica Jones so they will need to somehow give him a powerful foe while still keeping the story contained without having to bring in daredevil or whomever. Basically the balance between why doesn't Luke Cage just beat up everyone and ok Luke Cage clearly cant stop this super powerful/dangerous villain doesn't daredevil know about this guy.

", "id": "d4dfwvv"}, {"comment": "So, from the top? Days of Future Past isn't an X-Men movie, it's a Wolverine movie set in the First Class continuity. Iceman is only there to set up the Worf Effect, which really we don't need, because people should know how powerful Sentinels are, or at least they would if they'd been shown in the movie series at any point other than Colossus and Wolverine using the Fastball Special to take one out in one shot. Bishop, Warpath, Sunspot and Blink are on screen for less than ten percent of the film and, yeah, maybe it's because I haven't watched it in about a year, but I can't remember them even being named. Cyclops and Jean Grey show up at the end to remind you that everything you spent your time in watching for the past fifteen years doesn't matter now, which has both good and bad elements. The scene where old Xavier and young Xavier talk via Wolverine's mind makes no fucking sense. The setup for the movie is that Mystique is the villain who alters time, but of course the villain is Magneto, and of course he just walks away without even trying to clear his name despite the fact that he was wrongly imprisoned for *ten years*.\n\nApocalypse isn't perfect. No movie is. Like, the casting of Olivia Munn as Psylocke is...strange at best, and on top of that, she's only named as Psylocke once. Angel is the same way, being only named as Angel, not tied to Warren Worthington (probably because there's almost no way the kid from Last Stand would have been alive in 1984). Also Psylocke's outfit, though accurate to the comics, is pretty bad by almost any standard. But it was an enjoyable movie, it made believable characters out of basically everyone there, and for once, everything that everyone was doing made sense. Also Quicksilver's slow-motion scene in Apocalypse is more entertaining than the one in Days of Future Past IMHO.\n\nI just found Apocalypse to be more enjoyable, because despite the threat being every bit as dangerous and deadly, and knowing going in that there was going to be a \"happy\" ending, it still felt brighter and more hopeful of a movie to me, and that is an important distinction right now.\n\nMaybe it's just that Apocalypse was what it was, while DoFP just didn't live up to all that it could have been.", "id": "d4dmok7"}, {"comment": "I just saw Apocalypse yesterday and I also agree that it was a better movie than DoFP. To me the story just made more coherent sense. It wasn't all that complicated and there was no real shenanigans with time travel muddying everything up. There were moments of character growth and all the characters seemed believable without being caricatures or outlandish. Really the least necessary part of the movie was the entire bit at the dam setting up another movie, and even then, there were subtleties in the acting and directing there which did a nice job of revealing character elements.\n\nThe film did a lot of great showing and not telling. The movie could have come out and said Scott is a leader and he loves Jean. Oh and Jean and Wolverine is a weird thing, but it didn't have to say it. It showed these moments well and in small strokes. I agree Psylocke was weird but at the same time, she served her role. The director/writers still have no idea what they want to do with Magneto but his struggle was more interesting in this movie than in DoFP.

Soap opera worries about other people are impractical. Logan just gets his work done and then he has a beer. Whether or not Cyclops is this or Storm is that just doesn't matter. I take this as a joke against immaturity, and not a revelation of Wolverine's weakness as some kind of shallow creature.

Squirrel Girl does not have her handy deck of Deadpool villain cards so presumably her subconscious being ignorant to his usual methods of attack relates to his title of *Count* and projects the thought of *counting* onto the apparition. Nefaria is pretty similar to Nefarious... So Count Nefaria in her dream seems to get muddled with the thought of Counting Nefariously. Counting Nefariously proceeds to be the new challenge put forth, as both must count to a large number using only 1 hand to decide a victor. See, part of this relies on Squirrel Girl's tendency to not attach negative stereotypes and associations with villainous characters. She did not dream Count Nefaria to be vicious person.... rather her brain attempted to take his name literally. The demonstration is a peek into her inner psyche. She seems to be not just demonstrating but also recalling the way in which the binary hand trick was taught to her. This is a glimpse into the side of Doreen that is passionate about computer science or just plain passionate about learning/teaching in general. It is also a glimpse into how her thought process may work.

Yes, there is a reason why it is happening, but no actual plot happens for the entirety of the two pages, it's literally just two pages of teaching binary. That is all it is. There is the odd not-exactly-funny quip in there (for my sense of humour), but besides that nothing happens. Now, something similar happens in Sex Crims #3, [where one of the lead characters literally just sings Queen's *Fat Bottomed Girls*, but they couldn't get the rights to print the lyrics to the song so Matt Fraction and Chip Zdarsky just talk over it, for three whole pages](http://imgur.com/gallery/PrnZp) and it is absolutely fantastic, because what is going on is, whilst plotwise basically nothing, funny and interesting.

Thumb has 2.\n\nStart with pinky. \nBottom digit is 1, middle is 2, tip is 3.  \nTogether, that makes 1 of Ring's bottom digit (value = 3).  \nPinky goes 4,5,6.  \n2nd Ring digit, total value 6.  3rd is 9.  \nThat makes middle's bottom = 9. So middle middle is 18, middle tip is 27.  \nWhich makes pointer's bottom 27, middle 54, top 81.  \nWhich makes thumb's bottom 81, middle 162. Counting through one more time would give Thumb it's third, which is just finishing that side instead. Your open palm side is worth a total of 243.\n\nWhich, if you flip your hand over, is the value of the first pinky digit again. Go down the line like that, and you can get up to 59049. Filling out all the digits one last time gives you 88,572.\n\nIn short:  \nPalm Pinky = 3^0 per digit   \nPalm Ring = 3^1 per digit  \nPalm Middle = 3^2 per digit  \nPalm Pointer = 3^3 per digit  \nPalm Thumb = 3^4 per digit  \nBack Pinky = 3^5 per digit  \nBack Ring = 3^6 per digit  \nBack Middle = 3^7 per digit  \nBack Pointer = 3^8 per digit  \nBack Thumb = 3^9 per digit\n\nYou'll never use that.

Section 1: summary of the naming of the bill and what it wnats to accomplish\n2. Section 2: amending Title 19 Chapter 3 to add that no pastor, or clergyman, etc ever has to marry anyone they don't want to and they can't be sued or lose their tax exempt status for refusing to marry someone. The court would also be responsible for paying for court/legal fees if such a suit is brought up. Also, establishes the ability for individuals to attend or not attend any marriage to their discretion.\n3. Section 3: Amending Title 10 Chapter 1 to make it so that the government or citizens can not force a business to stay open on Saturday/Sunday. \n4. Section 4: Also Amending Title 10 Chapter 1. Talks about \"faith based organizations\". Says faith based organizations can refuse to offer charity or property (to rent, lease, etc.) to anyone and if anyone threatens civil suit for denying these things, the faith based organizations can counter-sue the government and get their legal fees paid. They also must notify the government at least 30 days before filing a counter-suit. \n5. Section 5: Similar to section 4, but for hiring/firing people because they are counter to their religious beliefs. \n6. Section 6: Says the government can not by law \"burden\" people from expressing their religion unless the government can prove that they need to to further their interests. Also, nothing in section 6 applies to anyone in prison\n7. The government waives sovereign immunity for any suits related to section 6.\n\nMy Comments: \n\n1. No comment\n2. No objection to not making anyone *attend* a wedding they don't want to. \nNot making priests legally marry people makes sense on paper, but can easily be twisted to deny gay people from getting married in a church. Definitely don't like the whole make the government pay for the legal fees.\n3. No objection: If you own a business, you can decide that you don't want to be open on saturday/sunday\n4. Not a fan at denying property rights or charity, could easily be discriminatory, especially denying public space (even though it's technically private, churches tend to be the easiest meeting space in many rural areas and are all but public meeting spaces). \n5. This is the section I have the biggest issue with, hiring/firing based on religious beliefs is something that should definitely be considered discriminatory \n6. Could cause issues if \"practicing your religion\" goes against laws, even though they kind of explain this away with the whole \"no penal code applies to this\" section, meaning section 6 is a attempting to be a law that doesn't apply to any law...\n7. There so churches can sue the government if it \"burdens them\" from practicing their religion, redundant since the first amendment basically allows for this anyway.\n\nOverall, the bill seems to be either redundant or airing on discriminatory. My personal feeling on the whole issue is why would gay people *want* to be married by a homophobic pastor in a homophobic church?

To explain another little piece of this problem is what does a business represent legally. Legally a business is an entity that provides a service to the community in exchange of goods (in 99.9% of the cases, those goods are money) in accordance to the laws of the government. Under that deal, the person operating the business can negate any deals as long as she does not violate any law.

Freedom of speech protects any person from being censored by any government entity. That means that if I'm outside a in a park saying that I don't like something, as long as I am not infringing any laws nor any rights of any other people, the government cannot go and censor me. \n\nNow, freedom of speech does not entail person to person. That means that if I go to the lawn of a neighbor and start badmouthing him, he has every right to go and kick me out of his property. \n\nNow in terms of this case once more. If a gay person goes to a cake shop and orders any regular cake then he is not infringing anything from the cake shop owner. Therefore as long as the service is paid, the gay person has not done anything illegal. Now the owner may refuse to provide the service for any reason that does not violate the gay person civil rights. That means maybe it is too complex the cake, they ran out of batter, etc. but if they do not have any reasons for that, then they have to provide the service to that person like every other person. Now, if the cake shop owner makes the cake but he's constantly telling the gay person \" I don't like gay people, you are going to hell!\" as long as he is not performing anything that can be cataloged as assault to the gay person, then the gay person just have to shrug it. \n\nThat's the difference from freedom of speech and what this case is defending.

The point of libertarianism as originally defined was the idea that government should be guided by the primary aim of maximizing everyones liberty. \n\nThat would typically include protecting you against harm as a result of unscrupulous business practices.\n\nTo this law specifically, I would argue as a libertarian socialist that a libertarian should come down in support of denying the right to discriminate. The reason is that one of the key limiting factors on our ability to maximize liberty is scarce resources. \n\nBusinesses take up space, and satisfy part of the available demand. As a result, if we allow discrimination, discriminatory businesses will at least in part displace businesses that don't, and as a result place restrictions on those discriminated by reducing their ability to gain access to products and services that are available to others.\n\nWe can not ensure total liberty, and often the trade-offs that maximize liberty for society as a whole will mean limits on other peoples liberty (and there is lengthy arguments to be had about how strict restrictions may be placed on an individual to protect greater society), but specifically to this, the nature of business is that there are more customers than business owners (it'd be a very bad business otherwise...) - as such, targeted regulation of a business is in general less likely to infringe as much on personal liberty as allowing such a business to make demands of their customers outside of those necessary for their type of business.\n\nIf we had infinite resources and infinite space, I'd be all for letting the bigots do whatever they like, as nobody would be forced to deal with their presence.

In the comic Ultron was a cautionary tale about how fast technology and AI can spiral out of control if you let it, and was kind of a meditation on the quickening of modern society. Ultron itself, when set loose, was implacability personified, and spread like disease. In AoU he really just talked a lot and acted like just another florid prose spewing movie supervillain with a silly  esoteric master plan just waiting to be foiled by the heroes.\n\n3) **Shoehorning in Romance**- The Hulk and Black Widow's \"courtship\" or whatever you want to call it was inorganic to the point of it being cringey. Dr Cho's \"Is Thor going to be there?\" line wasn't much better. The lack of chemistry was so apparent that I'm surprised that they didn't just decide to forgo the romantic subplots in favor of more plot development.\n\n4) **The Characters Were All One Dimensional**- I guess this really couldn't be helped, as it's an ensemble picture and there isn't much room for things like complex character arcs. Plus it's a popcorn movie. But holy shit was each personality static. Iron Man's the playboy, Cap is the headstrong banner carrier, Hulk is just trying to keep it together, Black Widow is the femme fatale, Hawkeye is just lucky to be there but comes through when you need him, Thor is the wooden but indispensable square peg. No one changes, no one grows, it's all really just a dog and pony show. Yeah there's conflict, I guess, but did any character seem like they were in any real jeopardy or going through anything that actually mattered?\n\n5) **Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver's Parts Were Unnecessary**- They were \"let's just give them shit to do\" characters, which is troubling because it's kind of emblematic of how cynical the MCU can become if they're not careful. \"Hey let's put these characters in to rope in their fans! Who cares if they're just taking up space?\" And his dopey death scene along with her here-one-scene-gone-the-next accent and silly hand movements didn't help.\n\n6) **The Helicarrier Deus Ex Machina Was Preposterous**- Even for comic book movie standards, a gigantic flying aircraft carrier just popping onscreen out of nowhere to save the day is pretty absurd. I mean yeah, you gotta suspend the shit out of your disbelief for movies like this, but that was a bridge too far for me.\n\nAnd finally...\n\n7) **It Was Too Invested in Universe Building**- This is an ongoing problem in all capes and costumes flicks nowadays, so I can't beat on this drum too hard. But at no point did I feel any real tension, and at no point did I feel like the filmmakers took any real risks. That's my biggest problem with the MCU as it stands now, the novelty has worn off and I feel like we're left with a bunch of wisecracks and distractions that are designed to do little more than shuffle the audience through into other properties. Sure they'll deliver some technical coolness and a few laughs, but other than that there's next to no meat on the bone. That's why *Deadpool* was such a great film, it saw how banal and dead eyed these movies are becoming and let the audience know that they're paying attention. I'm curious to see how Disney reacts to that film's success and resonance.\n\n-------\n\nBut don't get me wrong, AoU had some good points, and I'd put it at a solid 2.5 out of 4. It's watchable, it looked great, it didn't really fumble the ball with the characters, The Vision was pretty cool, and I guess even Ultron stole a few scenes thanks to James Spader's hammy performance.\n\nBut on the whole, I feel like this movie just might be an indication that the MCU's best days are quite possibly behind it, which really sucks because *Infinity War* is my favorite Marvel book of all time.\n\nWe'll see I guess...\n", "id": "d2n31n4"}, {"comment": "Considering Ant Man was very well received, and CW is currently getting insanely good reviews it sounds a little premature to be saying this.

There purpose is to attract those who would have no interest without them.\n\nEdit\n[\nHere's an article about it.](http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/27/trailer-spoilers-southpaw)\n", "id": "cxz4me6"}, {"comment": "> My argument is \"If they felt ok with putting it in the trailer, it's not a spoiler.\"\n\nAgain... Terminator Genisys. \n\n>I don't really see what went down in the BvS trailer as all that different from when Hulk smashes that giant whaleship thing in the Avengers trailer,\n\nWhile I agree they shouldn't have put that in the trailer, when you get down to it, that was really nothing more than a cool effects shot. \n\nWith the BvS trailer, they spoiled a character reveal. A better example is how they put Hulk catching Tony in the trailer, as it spoiled the fact that he made it back through the portal. \n\nNow, the BvS trailer might not turn out to be a major spoiler, as certain people associated with the movie are now claiming. But it still would have been cool to have kept that a surprise.\n", "id": "cxzmvh1"}, {"comment": "> My argument is \"If they felt ok with putting it in the trailer, it's not a spoiler.\" \n\nThat doesn't actually make any sense.\n\nFirst, the creative personnel who made the film generally aren't responsible for approving the trailers. So what you're saying is \"if some random guy in marketing whose name I don't even know thinks it's OK, then I'm OK with it\".\n\nSecond, even in situations where the creative personnel do have input or control over the final trailer, you may still be dealing with a situation where they don't care about spoilers.

And now we're going to get a film that looks like it's going to be very personal. \n\nMaybe I'm not explaining myself well, and maybe I'm also projecting what I want onto the general public.

Know nothing about him other than his work on Vice which looked good...\n\nNot quite, it's short for \"Bullshit artist\". Dude is addicted to lying, he can't help himself. I've met a lot of cunning motherfuckers in my time, but without a doubt, Shane Smith is the most natural, born-to-it con artist I've ever come across - I have no doubt that, if not for the fact he ended up at VICE, that he'd be this generation's Joseph Weil or Victor Lustig.\n\nI'll focus on Shane, rather than VICE, because that would be two enormously long posts, instead of just one since they're both pretty fucking dodgy.\n\nPutting together the story of Shane Smith from across interviews, books, and everything else, the man's own words, he's lived hard. Grew up poorer than dirt, bullied, fought every kid in his school, was constantly fighting. Left home at 13, worked in a bar before joining a gang and dealing cocaine at 14, got out after a dozen friends and gang members were killed, went to university where he got a BA in English, History, and Political Science with a Masters in Political Economy from Carleton, went traveling in Europe and went back to being a criminal by illegally buying and selling currency, became a journalist when he landed in Bosnia, and ended up as a war reporter for Reuters. He got sick of all the unethical and lying bullshit he saw the other reporters pulling, so when he went back to canada, he founded VICE, and pulled Shane and Suroosh on board, and with clever and brave reporting and business decisions, built it into the multinational media empire it is today.\n\nHell of a story, right? Fucking oath it is! Here's the parts of it that were true - He grew up in canada, went to university, went to Europe, and VICE is now a media empire.\n\nHe's actually thoroughly upper-middle class, He didn't leave home at 13, he just went to live with his mother instead of his father. He's from a sleepy, calm little government town. According to McInnes(who, for his faults, has known Smith since the age of 12, and other associates have confirmed), he never sold cocaine or worked in a bar, and according to public records, actually just attended the reasonably prestigious Lisgar Collegiate from 13-17, and by all accounts was a fairly average student who didn't cause or receive any abnormal amount of trouble, and didn't get in any fights.\n\nHe was also never in a gang, and for him to have had a dozen gang members die, he would have had to have been in a gang with every single gang member who died in Ottawa over a period longer than he claims to have been in said gang.\n\nAfter that, he did go to University, but it seems he just got a BA(single) in English and potentially one other subject, and the timeline for his masters doesn't make a lick of sense, nor does anything exist that indicates he did, like for example, a copy of a thesis or a thesis defense, photos, or people who knew him.\n\nHe did go to Europe, that much is true - but he was just an ESL teacher in Hungary. If he ever engaged in illegal currency trading, there's no record for obvious reasons, but people who knew him at the time say they never heard so much as a word about it, or had any reason to believe he was doing it. He never so much as set foot in Bosnia during the war, and Reuters has absolutely no record whatsoever of him doing any work for them, ever, in any capacity, during that period. He's also claimed he worked for the Budapest Sun, who also have no record of him doing any such thing.\n\nAnd finally - he didn't start VICE. McInnes and Suroosh had already started the magazine and run it for about a year before Shane came on board, according to Mcinnes(So take that for what it's worth) because they felt sorry for him, since he was having trouble finding work after coming back from Europe, and was feeling a bit adrift. This is where he found his style, to use his own words from \"Vice Guide to Sex Drugs and Rock and Roll\", of just making up stories for the magazine whole cloth, or just pretending stories he'd heard had happened to him.\n\nThere's also a few other lies that stick out here and there. Like the time he spent a year lying about having a terminal illness(in reality, he was just cheating on her and draining her for cash), the time he said a documentary he worked on, \"Heavy Metal in Baghdad\", won a doco award at Berlin Film festival(an award that doesn't actually exist) and the Critic's choice award at the Toronto Film Festival(which also doesn't exist, or at least, didn't at the time), claiming on different occasions that VICE has more than 800 or 1,100 employees in 34 countries(which other VICE staff describe as \"preposterous\" and \"ridiculously false\"), and finally, claiming he'd interviewed Kim Jong Un, and that they'd be releasing it \"soon\"(which they haven't, because it never happened.)", "id": "d5gb0cj"}, {"comment": "I'm not sure that Gavin actually believes in anything he says.

On their trail is Star, an agent of an agency called the Grail who want to use Jesse's power for nefarious purposes and also, ever in the background, lurks the Saint of Killers, an unstoppable killing machine who acts and talks like Clint Eastwood in every Western movie you've ever seen. \n\nIt's violent and blasphemous and gory as hell, full of events that will make you laugh disbelievingly and say \"Did I just read that?\" It's also achingly real, with one of the most realized bromances ever, and is essentially Garth Ennis's love letter to the Western and to America. \n\nAlso, there's a fella that has a face like an arse. \n\nGo pick it up! The tv adaptation is out now on AMC so you should be able to find the 9 trades in stores. Starts of with Preacher:Gone to Texas. You won't regret it. One of my top five favorite comics ever. It was one of the first non-superhero comics I ever read way back when I started collecting.

(I've also always read the line as being delivered the same way someone might say, \"I picked up the groceries today.\" But I recognize that that's idiosyncratic.)\n\nSnyder doesn't give you that moment. He doesn't let the meaning of the words settle over you. He doesn't let your imagination a moment to catch up to the rest of your brain and go, \"HOLY SHIT!\" Instead he:\n\n* Cuts away from Ozymandias just before he says the line to a reaction shot of Rorschach and Nite-Owl.\n* Has the camera in motion.\n* Has the score rise to a crescendo.\n* Hard cuts away from the line to immediately show what happened 35 minutes ago.\n\nThe entire effect is to anticipate (and thus undercut) the line; and then place the emphasis on the action to follow instead of the line itself.\n\nAll of that, by itself, would completely ruin the effectiveness of the line. (Which is why you never see anybody quoting the line who hasn't read it in the comic book: In the movie, it's simply not quotable.)\n\nHe also rewrites the line. The first of these (changing \"Republic serial villain\" to \"comic book villain\") is largely irrelevant to the current discussion (although it does needlessly remove nuance; one of the major points in *Watchmen* is that in a world where superheroes actually exist, they aren't perfect heroes -- it isn't the Marvel universe where the Marvel comics are actually published; it's a universe where superhero comics didn't exist). But the crucial change is from:\n\n* \"I did it thirty-five minutes ago.\"\n\nto:\n\n* \"I triggered it thirty-five minutes ago.\"\n\nAnd the semantic shift, though subtle, is not insignificant. If you trigger something, you have set it in motion (which inherently means you could still stop it). If you did something, on the other hand, then it's done. This, too, effectively undercuts the ability for the finality of the line to land.\n\nIf I was teaching a class in film editing, I would cue this up along with the special editions of the *Star Wars* movies as examples of how subtle the difference in editing is between a great film and a mediocre one.\n\nIt actually reminds me of the story told by the scriptwriters for *Casablanca*. That film was infamously being rewritten basically up until the last day of shooting, and they had just written the famous ending to the film the day before it was filmed. (\"Round up the usual suspects.\") So the director films it, it gets edited, and then they call the writers to tell them that the ending isn't working. So the writers head over to the studio and they discover that they're basically trying to do it in one take, \"Major Strasser has been shot.\" (looks at Rick) \"Round up the usual suspects.\"\n\nAnd the writers say, \"No, no, no. You have to say, 'Major Strasser has been shot.' And then cut to Rick. And then cut to Renault. And then cut to Rick. And then cut back for, 'Round up the usual suspects.'\" You have to see the thought. And so they recut the scene and, of course, it's a classic.", "id": "d2ako4d"}, {"comment": "I agree with absolutely everything you've said.\n\nSomeone made a point downthread that nowadays this would be three or four panels. I don't think that's necessarily true, but it's a great way of thinking about Synder's execution vs Moore/Gibbons'. The comic equivalent of what Snyder did is having multiple panels, a reaction shot, a close up on Ozy's mouth as he completes the dialogue, and so on.\n\nBy contrast, the way Moore/Gibbon present this moment is deliberately flat. We have a single panel, straight-on and clean. The shapes of Rorschach and Nite-Owl in the foreground basically present as vertical lines. Perhaps most importantly, there's *distance* between us and Veidt, given the dialogue room to 'echo' between us and him. Rather than the immediacy of a close up, the panel is composed specifically to allow pause. Snyder doesn't do pause.", "id": "d2awnf6"}, {"comment": "The composition of the full page is also significant: It consists of three panels, each taking up the full width of the page.\n\nThe first is the panel shown in the link, which has all the characteristics you describe.

Their faces are completely blank in shock; like they've been hit in the face with a two-by-four. Notably, the panel is framed to show a bank of clocks in the background. The current time in New York as being one minute to midnight: Which is where the Doomsday Clock has been for the entire comic. Snyder tries to do the same thing, but (a) puts the reaction shot *before* the revelation and (b) makes the metaphor literal by showing the the actual countdown clocks of the operation at 00:00 (which also means he *cuts away from the moment*).\n\nThe third panel shows a street in New York. Utterly silent. It is, in fact, the fourth page in a row which has the final, page-wide panel depict that New York street. The previous instances had Ozymandias talking over them in captions; but this one does not -- it further extends the moment of silence that persists in that room between Ozymandias, Rorschach, and Nite Owl. And it simultaneously reveals that all those shots of New York you were seeing were, in fact, in the past... which inevitably leads you to imagine the destruction which is about to happen.\n\nAnd then you turn the page and there it is. But you still don't actually see a giant explosion. You see people react to it. And then you see them vaporized by it.\n\nIt's absolutely brilliant visual storytelling in every single way.\n\nSnyder, of course, goes for the disaster porn instead.\n\nI'm actually a fan of the movie.

You're welcome to your own opinion, obviously, but I have to interject. We're talking about the greatest comic book ever written, and one of the best novels of the last century. The book ending works on every level that Moore set out to achieve and was, in no way, outdone by Synder's adaptation. \n\n>Ozymandius is much more of a stereotypical villain in the movie. He\u2019s basically Doctor Doom. Doctor Doom\u2019s backstory is that he has seen all possible futures, and the only one that ends without humanity\u2019s destruction is the one where they are ruled by Doom. Therefore, he is doing everything he can to take over. Similarly, Ozymandius, in the movie, is convinced that humanity will destroy itself and does what he can to engineer their future. This is, on the surface, similar to his motivations in the book, BUT the movie erases almost all of his character development. \n\n>In the book, Ozy supplies humanity with limitless energy. He works tirelessly to provide humanity with everything they need to make themselves better. They fail to improve as fast as he wanted or expected them to, and he loses hope. He becomes desperate and creates a monster that will unite humanity towards a common purpose. He knows it\u2019s an evil act, but he has truly reached the end of his rope. In working to save humanity, he creates a monster. \n\n>In the movie, Ozy never gives humanity that chance. He used the device that was supposed to *supply* limitless energy to enact his plan. He never reached the end of his rope. The movie, therefore, completely skips over the motivations that Ozy had for actually having a plan like that in the first place. Book Ozy would not have done anything like that until after humanity had already proved that they were incapable of setting aside their differences without an external threat.\n\n>But, were they incapable of setting aside their differences? Here, the book raises another interesting possibility. The monster Ozy creates was creating psychic emanations that were messing with people\u2019s minds. We know this, because it\u2019s hinted at in several parts \u2013 such as the man who kills his children for no apparent reason. The squid was messing with people\u2019s minds. It\u2019s entirely possible, and in my mind even likely, that the squid was stopping humanity from changing the way he wanted them to. Maybe their initial development was just slow, and Ozy completely impeded it with his actions. The monster made them irrational and aggressive. On top of this, it\u2019s entirely possible that it was affecting *his* mind in some way, stopping him from seeing or acknowledging the flaws in his plan. It\u2019s possible that, in the end, Ozy is responsible for the situation that caused him to enact his plan. \n\n>This in turn, is what creates the masterful parallels to the pirate story. The pirate is Ozy. He and the pirate both see real but, as we know, overblown threats. No one would say they're wrong to fight them, but they lose all hope and sanity in doing so. Ozy, without allowing time for real adjustment, creates a monster that likely prevents that adjustment. The pirate, similarly, thinks it's too late and kills that which he's trying to protect. Both damn themselves despite the fact that they were both working towards honorable ends.\n\n>In this light, his actions are much more morally ambiguous than in the movie, where he basically cuts past the limitless energy step and just says, \"fuck it.\" He blows up a few cities, blames Manhattan, and takes control. The point about him being at his wits end and the moral ambiguity there is lost.\n\n>The squid also serves an important metaphorical point. Ozy took all the words scientists and artists to create this squid. He robbed the world of its culture. This is a metaphor for the death of art and progress in times of fear and war. Instead of being used to create something positive, all of humanity\u2019s inventiveness is directed to death, fear, and destruction. \n\n>There's another, more meta, reason for the inclusion of the squid. One of the recurring themes of the comic is that, no matter how meaningful or adult the subject matter, most people don't take comics seriously. You can see that repeatedly with the Bernards. This kid is reading a horrifying and brutal story about the pirate, with heavy metaphoricalc meaning, and the adult Bernard is dismissing it the entire time as a kids book. I don't recall the exact language, but it continually happens. The subtext is pretty clear - Alan Moore was showing that comics can be just as meaningful as classically-written books.\n\n>The squid alien is a tongue-in-cheek sort of reference to this, as it's such a pulpy-fifties comic sort of monster. The point in using it, in part, is that what the monster was doesn't really matter, it's the meaning behind the story that matters. People may dismiss it because it looks like a silly comic monster, but the story is still extremely meaningful and impactful.\n\n>The movie lacks all of this depth, and much of it can be attributed towards the changed ending. Like I said, I enjoy the movie. I own the Ultimate edition, running almost 4 hours. It\u2019s very enjoyable on its own and as a visual adaptation of the book, but Alan Moore is arguably the greatest comic book writer to ever live and Watchmen is arguably one of the greatest novels of the last century and most likely the greatest comic book ever written. I *highly* doubt he would watch Snyder\u2019s Watchmen and go, \u201cHuh.

As we move from the creative to the critical and the in-between, students will study a variety of artists who use the form of comics to tell stories, share information, and document the fantastical.

As I mentioned in my previous comment, this class is likely about the study of the super hero, not so much the study of comics themselves. These classes exist because of the growing idea that super heroes, in modern American society, have grown to fill the same niche in our cultural consciousness that fairy tales and religious legends served in Medieval Europe, or that heroic myths served in Greek and Rome, for example. These are the stories of our beyond-human heroes, our cautionary tales and our moral stories. And the spread presented here is a very good one for exploring those exact themes, while also looking at the potential impact super heroes might have on society if they were real.\n\n2. This is a class on super heroes in comics, and unless it's an advanced class on the subject, it needs to assume each and every student in there has never read a comic before in their life. It's just like an introductory class on Victorian literature, or Romantic poetry, or Greek myth: You can assume the students know these things exist, but you cannot assume they are scholars on the subject. It's safe to assume passing familiarity with the concept of the super hero, but that's where any assumption has to end. For this reason, you don't make the students read anything that isn't baseline and easy to grasp - which is to say, you don't go with the stuff that lifelong comic readers look at and say, \"Wow, I love how different this book is from the rest of the selection, and the *unusual* things it does with the theme.\"\n", "id": "d6s81gc"}, {"comment": "If you're going to teach superheroes and you're not at least reading any Steranko or some Kirby, and you're not reading published non-fiction about comics, like Marvel: The Untold Story, then you aren't learning anything that you can't do here on Reddit, which is how to articulately argue over Civil War and whether or not it sucks (it does).  This class can't even learn about decompression, or legacy, or continuity because all of these comics are \"event\" or \"elseworld\" comics, and to argue that makes them \"more accessible\" is BS, you could hand someone a specific story arc of Claremont's uncanny x-men without having read xmen and they will get it, or Avengers: Under Siege, shit, there are plenty of examples of this.  ", "id": "d6s9vm8"}, {"comment": "Honestly, I feel like if you could get over this idea that \"shit sucks, don't read it,\" your knowledge on the subject would make you a fascinating and valuable classmate in a course like this. And you're absolutely right in saying a class like this could do with looking more at the legacy, continuity, and evolution of the super hero. But perhaps that's more advanced stuff. You and I wouldn't consider it advanced, but I'd wager you've been reading comics longer than even I have, and I approached comics in the first place with a love of fairy tales and myths and their impact on culture. So neither one of us is what you could describe as a \"casual reader.\"\n\nMore non-fiction wouldn't be a bad idea either.\n\nThat said, it looks like the theme this class is going for is focused pretty heavily on the concepts of power and responsibility. Makes complete sense to me, as these themes currently carry a heavy weight in the American cultural consciousness. You clearly feel the class shouldn't limit itself in this fashion, and you're not wrong that. But it is what it is. Either way, you can't keep going back to \"it sucks\" as an argument for why something shouldn't be read. If I pulled that shit in my class on Romantic poetry, I wouldn't have read anything (I hated all of it, and still do ... so, so much) and I would have failed. You need to trust the instructor to choose material that relates to the core teachings of the class.\n\n\nI'd personally avoid the X-Men in a class like this. They are extremely valuable in any conversation regarding the evolution of the super hero or the super hero's place in modern society, and in any conversation about power and responsibility. But they basically sat out Civil War for a specific reason: You aren't going to get anywhere in that conversation once you bring the allegory of racism into the mix. People will get stuck on that, in our modern society, and with good reason. And Kirby, Steranko's, any of that old school work doesn't do anything to support a conversation about the modern super hero - they're all about the origin and evolution.\n\nAvengers Under Siege, though - that's a good choice.

It could teach them about legacy (capt. Marvel), myth (herc), decompression (compare it to civil war), the struggle for women's representation (wasp).  Just the fact that I want to talk about Under Siege about a dozen times more than civil war is why  I think it's fair to say that these comics suck, I know that's not a critique, but seriously, Brad Meltzer and marvel's marketing event so nice they've done it twice? Alex Ross, the great white hype of artists? Having some Busiek in there is the only saving grace.  I have been researching the history and themes of specifically superhero comics since I was a grade school student, I independently learned all there was to know before going to college, this class, no matter what they were reading, would probably have been a waste for me personally, so I am biased yes.  I think the grander problem here is that comicbooks haven't been considered part of the mainstream or big media in a long time, and they're coming back into the zeitgeist a bit here because of movies and a booming nerd culture, we need the next generation to see the entire scope of the medium so that the next gen of creators has been exposed to a diverse selection of comics, this just isn't diverse enough for that.  Teaching this shit puts it into a class with literature, history, poetry, fine art, you wouldn't only read your class Beat Poet works right? This selection of comics is almost all of the same classification and era, and might work really well as an intro course, but I doubt this institution has any  high level comics courses to follow.

It's a stupid trope.\n\nSay you make a kabangnium ray gun that costs you a hundred thousand dollars. You have a choice. You can sell that gun at a markup and make a hundred ten, or _you can rob a hundred people of a thousand dollars each to break even, then keep robbing people to keep making money_.\n\nEvery business venture has sunk costs and overhead. You anticipate and account for that when you plan your business.\n\nSetting finances aside, why the hell would you sell your kabangnium ray? As it stands, you're the only one in the world who has one, and it makes you unstoppable. As soon as you start selling them, though, each customer has as much power as you. You'd only be creating competition which would drive your potential earnings down, not to mention setting yourself up to have your good guy rival buy one, take it apart, and create an anti-kabangnium ray with the knowledge he gains by retroengineering it.\n\nThere's absolutely no good reason a person inclined toward supervilliantry should sell their creations. Supervilliany is a tax free, profitable, high yield business option that can by definition never devalue. Legally selling inventions is... generally none of those things. When's the last time you met a professional inventor?", "id": "d7d2j00"}, {"comment": "That's why you patent the thing. Suppose for now that you are the only person in the world with a kabangnium ray, and you choose not to disclose the design to the public, but rather keep it as a trade secret. Instead, you use it to slowly crawl your way out of debt, one pearl necklace at a time. That sounds like a safe plan, assuming that you are the only person in the world who is capable of creating a kabangnium ray. But suppose that while you were secretly working on your kabangnium ray, engineers were doing the same. Once someone else arrives at the same invention, your competitive edge is lost. And in fact, depending on whether or not your country uses a \"first to invent\" or \"first to file\" patent system, someone else who arrived independently at the same invention can actually patent the device out from under you, given that you didn't publicly disclose your method of manufacturing the kabangnium ray.", "id": "d7d4nk8"}, {"comment": "These things are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThat said, patents still open up avenues for your rivals to retroengineer your tech and find ways to disable it.

That's a return of 162,000 a year if Kite Man pulls off just three average-tier bank robberies per month. But why would you build a Kite Suit to only use three times a month?\n\nThe average bank robbery takes about fifteen minutes- anything beyond that is police standoff territory, which ideally should just never happen; avoiding that kind of nonsense is what the Kite Suit is for.\n\nSo, say Kite Man only wants to put in part time hours; maybe he's working on his degree in Criminal Law or something. If we assume each bank he wants to hit is fifteen minutes apart, and the Kite Suit negates traffic, then at 28 hours a week he can hit, what, 14 banks?\n\n14 times 162,000 is 2,268,000. So, we're looking at two million plus for part time hours on a self employed make your own schedule basis. If the suit cost a million, he's paid off all his overhead and is making pure tax free profit in six months.\n\nSo yeh.

By it's very nature Kite Man needs a high vantage point to launch from. As many banks are ground floor structures and store their on-hand cash in ground level or below ground level vaults Kite Man would have quite a task ahead of him to get back to take-off level. If we assume he has a glide ratio of 20:1, which is probably a low ball estimate if he's made significant technological advances beyond commercial hang gliders, Kite Man would need to launch from the fourth floor of a structure to land 1km away. That would only give him about five minutes head start on a person leaving from the bank's front doors! A car could obviously make that distance in far less time. \n\nSo if we assume that Kite Man would want to put at least 5km between himself and any possible pursuit before he switches to a get away car he'd need to launch from a much greater height, almost 70 stories!\n\nThat limits him to only the very largest of banks in major cities, greatly limiting his potential earnings over a given period. \n\nThough this line of investigation opens up a possibility that I think we've both missed!\n\nKite Man is best suited to operating in a very vertical environment, such as the skyscrapers of Metropolis or Gotham. And what do you tend to find a lot of at the tops of major skyscrapers?\n\nSecret corporate laboratories! \n\nKite Man could potentially make back his earnings not with pedestrian back robbery, but as a corporate espionage specialist!
