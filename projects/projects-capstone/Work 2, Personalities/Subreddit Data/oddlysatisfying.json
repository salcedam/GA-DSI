He shares about his process:\n\n>*Building \u201csandcastles\u201d is a bit of a test. Nature will always be against you and time is always running out. Having to think fast and to bring it all together in the end is what I like about it. I rarely start with a plan, just a vague notion of trying to do something different each time. Once I begin building and forms take shape I can start to see where things are going and either follow that road or attempt to contradict it with something unexpected. In my mind they are always mash-ups of influences and ideas. I see a castle, a fishing village, a modernist sculpture, a stage set for the oscars all at once. When they are successful they don\u2019t feel contained or finished. They become organic machines that might grow and expand.

From the US police perspective, the possibility that removing the bolts could damage the staircase, cause a safety hazard, or not be put back together correctly (or at all) would be enough to have the police tell them to leave (although in this case I don't think they'd be charged with a crime, maybe a warning if the cop thought they were removing the bolts for malicious reasons).\n\nSkiing on a public staircase like that would also attract police attention. Unlike a skate park where everything is controlled and intentionally designed to be ridden on, skiing on a structure not intended for that purpose would cause the police to tell you to stop.\n\nFirst, it's a possible safety issue, as you could seriously injure yourself. If an officer saw this occurring and did nothing and one of them was seriously injured, their family could sue the police department for not stopping them when he saw them acting dangerously.\n\nSecond, there's also the possibility that their actions could unintentionally cause damage to the structure, so it's in the government's interest to prevent an unnecessary and possibly costly repair by having an officer tell them to leave.\n\nFinally, a lot of citizens driving by if they saw this happening would probably call the police to report it with the expectation that it would be looked into.

The comment at the top of that thread was a gif of Mr Bean flipping people off while riding in a car.

That's the epitome of retirement. \n\nSome examples of really bad ones are when people try to use meta as a relevant element. For instance you can't make a post about batman, then have somebody in the comments say \"here take my upvote\", and then post a gif of batman giving someone an upvote and call it retired. It's not in the rules, but it's pretty generally accepted that meta isn't an acceptable relevant element.

I'm sure I could learn to like it, but why should I?\n\nFun trivia: the reason it tastes like butt is because it's burnt as hell. The reason it's burnt as hell is because they need to do something to cover up the extremely stale taste, and they do that because most coffee goes *super* stale before it even hits the grocery store shelves.\n\nGround coffee goes stale within minutes. Whole beans are better, but not by much, it only takes days or (maybe) weeks.\n\nThen on top of all this, some places decide to cover the burnt taste by adding huge amounts of sugar or cream or something, turning the coffee into nothing more than a base for a completely different drink that tastes *nothing* like coffee. Fun.\n\nNot that I'm trying to convince you that you \"really\" like coffee or anything like that. While it's possible you've never tasted actual fresh coffee, like you said, why go to all that trouble if you're just not interested? Caffeine usually gets so abused that it does more harm than good, so it's not like that helps...\n\nJust, like I said, I think it's interesting trivia.

Few things to note, not all designs use four color process, if your design uses only red and orange for example, then we might actually just use red and orange.\n\nAlso, when they print shirts, no one removes screens the way they do in this gif anymore. They're printed one of three ways - \n\n1. The screens are on a rotating wheel where the user spins it by hand to get to each color, bring it down and pull the squeegee by hand to apply the ink (this takes some technique and can be messed up).\n\n2. Automatic printing machines have all the wheels and squeegees controlled by machines. You might think \"oh that sounds easy, just press a button and get a shirt\" but each job takes a long time to set up each screen perfectly on the machine.\n\n3. Finally, there's heatsealing, where designs are printed on special plastic via a computer printer, then heatsealed into a shirt via a giant 500 degree press, usually applied by hand. It's faster and cheaper when making small jobs, but heatseal shirts don't quite last as long as good old plastic inks. (or at least they didn't when I worked there)\n\nAlso protip if you ever work at a t-shirt shop. To clean the ink off screens we use this stuff called \"Safety Clean\", not sure why it is called that, but if you ever spill some on yourself, strip and wash it off right away.

What this means is that when you print things (either screen print or using a printer hooked up to a computer), you're combining colours in such a way that what the eye will see will be, for instance, blue. To do that, the inks need to subtract all colour from the white light that is illuminating it except blue. This is subtractive.   \n\nBut with a monitor, you're not subtracting colours to reach your goal, you're adding them. This may seem a small difference but has massive implications. With additive colour, you don't use CMYK but instead used Red Green and Blue (or [RGB](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7081/7119002433_e17cf8122d_b.jpg)). When you print something, you add ink to the white paper to get a colour; with a monitor you add light. Add all of them (R:100, G:100, B:100) and you get white. The absence of any RGB is black (monitor blank); the absence of any CMYK is white (blank paper).   \n\nThe implication to bear in mind is that subtractive and additive colours have [different gamuts](http://mosaicdesignservices.com/webgraphics/presentations/2007-02/images/RGBvsCMYK.jpg), meaning that there are colours out there which you can create on a monitor that you can never create with ink, and vice versa. This is a huge issue if you want a specific design printed on a t-shirt from a design made on a computer, or when you design an entire building's colourful cladding using a monitor to discover that the building itself looks not-quite-right.  \n\nThere are a few ways to help mitigate the discrepancy, though. There are expensive monitor calibration systems called colorimeters. You can order samples of specific RGB colours printed and delivered hard-copy from a printer. You can specify RAL colours. But ultimately, there will always be the fact that what you see on a monitor will never be the exact representation of what you print.   \n\n\nEdit: I'm sure /u/latecherry knows this; this was intended more for someone reading about this stuff for the first time.  \n\nEdit 2: Holy shit, guys - this got fascinating real quick.

Theatrical and architectural lighting fixtures are sometimes LED and those use red, green and blue LEDs while other fixtures use what is essentially a very powerful light bulb as a light source (575 watt and 750 watt are both common in theatrical lighting). The type that use lamps frequently use a CMY color mixing system, and those fixtures generally have the best control of color. LED fixtures that use RGB tend to not be able to reproduce all colors equally well (they tend to make everything slightly too blue).\n\nAnd an interesting printing note, you'll notice I left off the K of CMYK. K is the key color and is black in printing today, as it is in OP's gif. It hasn't always been black though; it used to just be the cheapest ink they had and was sometimes brown or blue.

The screens are on a rotating wheel where the user spins it by hand to get to each color, bring it down and pull the squeegee by hand to apply the ink (this takes some technique and can be messed up).\n\n2. Automatic printing machines have all the wheels and squeegees controlled by machines. You might think \"oh that sounds easy, just press a button and get a shirt\" but each job takes a long time to set up each screen perfectly on the machine.\n\n3. Finally, there's heatsealing, where designs are printed on special plastic via a computer printer, then heatsealed into a shirt via a giant 500 degree press, usually applied by hand. It's faster and cheaper when making small jobs, but heatseal shirts don't quite last as long as good old plastic inks.

When it comes to processing colors like RGB or CMYK, we usually end with black, but will test the other colors in different orders to see what makes the particular blend we want best. Like Red and Blue make purple right? But if you go red first, you might get a more blue looking purple, where if you go blue first, it might come out a bit more on the megenta side. It's not a perfect process so we try it both ways usually.\n\nWhen doing process colors, it's never precise, colors mixing through holes washed into a screen just won't guarantee any kinda results.\n\nSo if you have a brand of some kind, say Dunkin Donuts, and you want to make sure the pink and orange come out just right on a process design, you may actually want to pay for additional colors.\n\nSo instead of doing CMYK or RGB, you'd do CMYK plus Dunkin Donuts Pink and Dunkin Donuts Orange.

In order to get that money back, you have to return the cans.\n\nAs for why you have to have the barcode - only certain beverages in cans/bottles have deposits.  And so each can has to be checked to see if it's actually a beverage that has a deposit.  Additionally, stores only have to take the bottles of beverages that they actually sell and give you money back.

The thinking also went that the trees would help to drain swamplands and reduce the incidence of malaria.\n\nBUT THEN:\n\n>Now the exotic blue gum is the most abundant tree in Portugal, covering about 7% of the land.

The thinking also went that the trees would help to drain swamplands and reduce the incidence of malaria.\n\nBUT THEN:\n\n>Now the exotic blue gum is the most abundant tree in Portugal, covering about 7% of the land. Walking through Vale de Canas beneath the towering gums feels bizarrely familiar, but Portuguese gum forests are deathly quiet. \u201cOur fauna can\u2019t feed on it; they can\u2019t find refuge in it. Our insects can\u2019t eat eucalyptus, so there are no birds,\u201d says Bingre. \u201cWe should introduce koalas. At least there would be something cute to look at.\u201d\n\nNew word for your vocabulary:\n\n>But it was the drying up of village water supplies that sparked a groundswell of opposition to the \u201ceucalyptisation\u201d of Portugal. \u201cEver since the mid \u201970s people have been protesting,\u201d explains Bingre.\n\nBut it's not all bad.\n\n>But de Andrade can find one redeeming feature. \u201cEucalyptus, it\u2019s good for some things,\u201d he says, pulling a long, slender object wrapped in bright fabric from the corner of the room. The didgeridoo is covered in a pattern of curls that he has marked into the wood using a small blowtorch. He gives me a quick demonstration and is surprisingly proficient. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to make these out of bamboo or balsawood,\u201d he says, testing its weight in one hand. \u201cBut eucalyptus is more special, I think.\u201d\n\n>\n\n", "id": "d8z46py"}, {"comment": "from the source:\n\n>To local environmentalists, the gum tree is to Portugal what the rabbit is to Australia.\n\n\nthis one is funny, because the rabbit is a native species from Portugal so both have to deal with each other's invasive biology\n", "id": "d8zjlm5"}], [{"comment": "Idk why but this picture gives me an uneasy feeling.", "id": "d8z9otm"}], [{"comment": "bad stuff has happened in there", "id": "d8zgjt1"}], [{"comment": "there's a treefarm like that near my parents house ", "id": "d8ywuf0"}], [{"comment": "Whoa, thought it was some 8-bit forest background from the thumbnail.", "id": "d8yww69"}], [{"comment": "I want to be there ", "id": "d8yxjot"}], [{"comment": "We used to drive past a tree farm on the way to my grandparent's house.

In this case, when the colors change you can see that \"wave\" moving down the line it appears to be kept in \"real time\". I would guess that they cut out and show one out of every 4 or one out of ever 6 frames, which would mean that we are actually seeing 6 or 4 frames per second in the final video, and that frequency corresponds to the wavelength between post-its and we are witnessing, therefore, the aliasing property, such that we begin to be deceived by what we \"see\".", "id": "d95yb0p"}, {"comment": "Compressing the hell out of it magnifies the effect since it looks for patterns that are present in both frames, so when the frame rate overlaps like this the compression thinks that nothing/very little has changed in the region that in reality is moving quite quickly.

What we are really trying to get at is a frame rate that fools our brains into seeing motion from still images. In reality, it's not just frame rate at play here. The poor resolution actually helps our brains fool themselves since it leaves much more detail for our brains to work out, which it can. If the image was crisp, the frame rate (sample rate) would have to be much higher to capture the correct frames to have the same aliasing effect. As far as the sampling rate and aliasing, this is precisely defined by the Nyquist\u2013Shannon sampling theorem. Essentially, if you sample fast enough you lose zero information in the sampling. This requirement is defined by the kind of information that you are trying to gather. The interesting thing about it, to me, in retrospect, is that it's not a definition of how things look, but in rather knowing whether you can trust what you see. If you know enough about the system and how you are observing it, you can know whether or not to trust that you are seeing what is actually happening. Like if you travel alongside a car accellerating at the same rate, you can watch the rims as the car accelerates. At some point, the tires will appear to spin backwards. We don't need a complex theorem or math to know that what we see is wrong, we simply know that if the cars were going backwards that the car would be accelerating in the reverse direction.

Yes, you use numbers (*measurable*^* quantities in general ), much like when carpenting you saw and you screw, and you have to be at least adept at it, but that's really only a minor part of carpenting. \n\nstudying math forces your mind to work methodically, understanding the characteristics of a problem, recalling what ways you know to handle each one, applying them, judging if it gets you anywhere and reckognizing if you are closer to a solution.\n\nyour mind transfers this process to your general way of thinking, not just when you have integrals and derivatives in front of you. \n\nMathematics is the closest thing to weightlifting for your mind. \n\nAnd I don't blame *anyone* who hates math, because it is ridiculously hard to teach... up there with learning to play the violin: you have to go through *hell* before you even start to see any point in practicing.

This explain why the wheel appears to be running very slowly and backwards.\n\nEDIT: This is just an example, and the right values will depend on the actual size of the wheel and the velocity of the car. But you got the idea.\n\nAlso, as stated here, the shutterspeed of the camera is very important too! Each frame is made by allowing light to enter and hit the sensor for a specific amount of time. The longer the shutterspeed, the brighter each frame is. But things in motion can get very blurred. A short shutterspeed, on the other hand, will make each frame looks sharp (and you have to compensate the brightness with other properties of the camera, like the ISO of the sensor, the aperture of the lens, etc).", "id": "d5tlku0"}], [{"comment": "Or.....

At the new hospital they discovered the actual problem, the line of Buckyballs was stuck in his intestines, but each individual magnet was in a different part of the intestines. The magnets came together but were separated by intestinal wall, and because they are so strong magnets, they were essentially cutting holes in the sides of his intestines from the magnetic force pulling them together.

The momentum introduced by one jet here is bigger than the others. Water will correct its height faster than it without any jet.\n\nThe runaway: The momentum will then make this nudge bigger.

The cylinder is an area of difficult terrain for Medium or larger creatures (Small or Tiny creatures must swim), it extinguishes all nonmagical light sources within it, and it remains for the spell\u2019s duration.  \n&nbsp; Any creature in the cylinder's space when you cast the spell, any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on its turn, or that starts its turn there must make a Strength saving throw. A Huge creature has advantage on the saving throw, and a Gargantuan creature succeeds automatically. A creature that is concentrating on a spell must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to maintain its concentration each time this spell's effect causes it to make a Strength saving throw.  \n&nbsp; A Huge or smaller creature that succeeds on its saving throw is pulled 5' toward the maelstrom's center. On a failed save, a creature is knocked prone, restrained, pulled up to 10' towards the maelstrom's center, and at risk of drowning for as long as it remains restrained. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the restrained condition on a success.  \n&nbsp; As a bonus action, you can move the maelstrom along the ground in any direction, spending feet from your own movement speed this turn to do so. You can ram the maelstrom into creatures, forcing them to immediately make the Strength saving throw with disadvantage. If the maelstrom moves over a pit, cliff, or other drop, it cascades downward to fill the cavity. Any creature restrained by the maelstrom moves with it. If the cavity is larger in volume than the maelstrom, it descends and changes shape to fill the cavity. The maelstrom can be made to scale obstacles and barriers up to 5' in height, requiring double the feet of movement while doing so.  \n&nbsp; When the spell ends, the water disperses outward, extinguishes all normal flames within 20' of the cylinder. Any creature restrained by the maelstrom is left prone in the space where it was when the spell ended.\n\n___\n\n*Edit: Formatting.

In the fall, because of changes in the length of daylight and changes in temperature, the leaves stop their food-making process. The chlorophyll breaks down, the green color disappears, and the yellow to orange colors become visible. At the same time other chemical changes may occur, which form additional colors through the development of red anthocyanin pigments.

First, the fructose molecules that make up most of the honey don't exhibit the strong hydrogen-bonding behavior that creates water's extra strong surface tension. \n\nMore importantly, the viscosity of honey vastly overwhelms any effects of surface tension in this case. Water has a very low viscosity, relatively speaking, and there's just not enough of it to create the shear stresses necessary to cause a faucet stream to bend around your finger. That's where surface tension helps in the case of water. For the honey, the massive viscosity *can* create those shear stresses, compelling the stream to bend in response.

While the flow looks very similar to the air flow over the ping pong ball above (if one could see the air flow), the cause is not really the Coand\u0103 effect.

There is no need for an additional vapor barrier as the correct type of foam will act as one.\n\nThe foam is actually really dense and can take the compression loads from the slab and live load just fine. Concrete cracks both because of what's underneath it but also because of the evaporation of water out of the mix.

This in itself is a ridiculous story, that I could talk about for hours. Basically, when Enron went under one of the things they did was sign mega contracts with some sort of trust or holding company to maintain all sorts of properties and services. I guess like escrow. But I don't really understand it. We have lease the house of one of these companies and whatever's left of Enron, through a law firm, pays the bill. They pay everything. And because Enron doesn't exist there is no one to cancel the contracts. So we've ended up with a house in Montreal that we left in 2001. All the maintenance is carried out, gardening, cleaning, burglar alarm. Absolutely everything. And because hardly any of us come here it's basically a time capsule. Except a perfectly preserved, maintained, time capsule.\n\nI'm only here to see some friends and cover a percussion festival for a UK mag.

Practice does not make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect. That is just a fact. There are some people who practice a lot and go nowhere. That's because they have no idea what they are supposed to practice. In middle/high school it's pretty much all about focusing on fundamentals and working your way up. Most kids at that age don't practice and also don't even know what to focus on to learn properly (unless you're talking about college, in which case I doubt she \"never practiced\" or your band was any good).\n\n2. Your argument also assumes that people were pretty much raised the same way. Everyone has different experiences, family, friends, etc. The most obvious contributor might be having piano lessons at an early age or something. Even just playing any instruments beforehand will help a lot. And there are more factors. Environment can also teach you efficient practicing.\n\nDid that section also happen to suck?

But I'll do so because people need to talk more and understand each other. Lets not try to push people away because of different opinions.\n\nLet's address some things then:\n\n1- It's not retarded to be proud of what you believe. You compare it to being proud of being heterossexual and it strikes you in a negative way because of that. There is no pride in being heterossexual because there is not a whole world against you because of what you believe, or because of the gender you love. Being gay isn't a choice, so when you are from day to day oppressed just for being what you are and have to hide it constantly, being proud by saying it out loud isnt a bad thing.\n\n2- You must browse all those subs that bash on 'sjws' all day long. You'd be perplexed to know that those are a incredibly small part of the populace, and just like the hugboxes they seem to be inside all the time, reddit is a hugbox for you too. It is your fault, yes, to take that associations for granted because many people arent like that. Im talking to you in a friendly tone, be careful on the way you thrread through the internet not to walk by the paths that you seem most confortable too. Your bias against 'sjw' and the gay pride flag is telling me this. \n\nGeneralization is bad, don't do it. A small amount of people can stain a whole movement and is your job as an intelligent human being to separate those.\n\nYour last phrase is the epitome of what i'm talking about. How can your best friend being gay invalidate that your generalizations are bad?\n\nTake your time, look at life with other eyes. Don't let reddit dictate how to think. The world have loud extremists but they aren't a majority. They are much closer to a small minority. \n\nSorry for the wall of text but I too at a point felt my rage against what I used to call 'sjw' but looking at things from all angles made everything better, I'm just trying to direct you not to fall in this hole of hatred.", "id": "da775ev"}, {"comment": "**It's okay if you don't want to read the text below.** If so, I just wanted to say thanks for the time you spent writing your comment.\n\nYou took your time to respond.

I've been opressed for a long time, not because of personal believes or anything, just because of who I am. Whether it were my parents or my classmates. I got more or less along with all the bullshit - but I'm not really proud of it. It's just like ... some sort of destiny. I don't believe in the principle of destiny but I can't find a better word for it. Like how the gay didn't choose to be gay, I didn't choose to get beaten up. But it's like .. either you get along with it or you don't. Being proud of handling it the first way is not really my philosophy.\n\nOn the other hand, I can't understand how people in the developed world can be proud of being gay. I never experienced life the way you stated it (\"the whole world is against you\"). I'm living in Cologne, and sometimes I think to myself that there are more homosexuals than heteros (which I wouldn't mind). And they're indeed tolerated. They're like everybody else and that's perfectly fine. It's not a big deal anymore. And I like it the way it is. Maybe I'm just not educated enough to know this, but I'd never guess that there's really a serious opression against homosexuals in a developed country. Ofc there's always this one bully who wants to feel better by elevating himself above others, but from some point on those ppl just get ignored and that's the end of the story.\n\n2- you're actually right. I've watched quite a lot of those \"SJW Cringe\" videos on YT lately. I don't even know why. I'm not quite sure why I'm so vulnerable if it comes to hatred in general.. but all the bullshit those SJWs talk about is so massively striking against common sense that they just drag me down to their level.\n\nThe bias against SJWs and gay pride has not the same intensity. Imo Gay Pride is just like... not really necessary like I stated above. That's just a thing of philosophy. But SJWs fill me up with disgust. That's just how it is. There is a part in me which says things like \"don't be an asshole, they might just be in a weird mental state and need help\".. but life told me one lesson concerning those thoughts: it's utopistic to expect 24/7 tolerance to every single piece of nonsense mankind makes up day by day. \n\nIf it comes to generalization, there are indeed situations in which it's not entirely bad to generalize. As an example: feminism. Why? Why do you need to fight for one gender? If you want to fight for equality , do it for everybody. Not just for one gender. It's just a contradiction in itself. Fighting for equality is only \"fighting for equality\", if you fight for everybody. That's why feminism is bad and egalitarianism is the better alternative. A counterexample: do you think that there are throughbred-nazis which are good people? Or is it okay to generalize nazis as bad persons?.. \n\nThe phrase in which I talk about my best friend should just clarify that I am not discriminating against gay people.\n\nAs a last note: I've already been walking in the direction you wanted to direct me to. But the gift I've gotten for being (over)tolerant was people hurting and using me. I'm pretty tired of that. And the direction I'm walking on right now (apart from this hatred part) is a temporary but good solution. A little bit of cynicism, a little bit of generalization but enough common sense to deal with daily life is good enough to not hurt people near me while maintaining my own believes. I hope you understand what I'm talking about. I'm not a native speaker and it's quite hard to pricesly get points across. Anyway.

What I, too, only recently learned via a video posted on Reddit is:\n\nOf course if we see actual yellow, which is between green and red on the spectrum, the red and green receptors fire somewhat, and the brain turns this into the correct realization \"There's yellow there.\", same for green+blue->cyan. But if instead of actual yellow we project red and green light in the same spot and perceive it as yellow, it is really only yellow in our perception - because of said trick the brain uses. What's really there is only red. And green. Imagine what it would be like to perceive that correctly: We would see that there is red and also green light in that place but no yellow light. While it's kinda clear that projecting red and green electromagnetic radiation into one place does not magically result in radiation of the wavelength that lies in between of them, we usually don't reflect that this is so and especially not what this means.\n\nWell, and magenta (etc.) is a color that doesn't exist as a wavelength at all: Because of the \"Red and green data? Probably means yellow.\" trick of the brain, one could assume that red and blue data would result in green since it lies between the two in the spectrum. But the green receptor is not firing (else we'd now see white), so the brain *makes up a new color*.\n\nBut there is no magenta (etc.) at the high end of the spectrum.

What I, too, only recently learned via a video posted on Reddit is:\n\nOf course if we see actual yellow, which is between green and red on the spectrum, the red and green receptors fire somewhat, and the brain turns this into the correct realization \"There's yellow there.\", same for green+blue->cyan. But if instead of actual yellow we project red and green light in the same spot and perceive it as yellow, it is really only yellow in our perception - because of said trick the brain uses. What's really there is only red. And green. Imagine what it would be like to perceive that correctly: We would see that there is red and also green light in that place but no yellow light. While it's kinda clear that projecting red and green electromagnetic radiation into one place does not magically result in radiation of the wavelength that lies in between of them, we usually don't reflect that this is so and especially not what this means.\n\nWell, and magenta (etc.) is a color that doesn't exist as a wavelength at all: Because of the \"Red and green data? Probably means yellow.\" trick of the brain, one could assume that red and blue data would result in green since it lies between the two in the spectrum. But the green receptor is not firing (else we'd now see white), so the brain *makes up a new color*.\n\nBut there is no magenta (etc.) at the high end of the spectrum.

Thick, opaque polishes are what you want. DONT try to waste your time with glitters, sheer colors, etc.\n\n\n-I use Sinful Colors for my black & white stamping, Sally Hansen Insta Dry for most everything else. It's coined insta dry because they're one-coaters, which leads to overall less dry time, not because they actually dry quickly which gives you more time to work while stamping!\n\n-[This](http://www.beautometry.com/product_p/cs-stamper-scraper.htm) is my favorite stamper so far. It's squishy and VERY large. My first stamper was from Wistonia, found [here](http://www.amazon.com/Winstonia-Double-Ended-Plastic-Scraper/dp/B00CJIOG0Q), but it did distort my images more imo. It's not a bad choice for beginners though!\n\n-Plate quality is SUPER important. You want to use reputable brands that will have deep, consistent etchings (99 cent plates should not be trusted; if they work, cool! but don't expect good results every time for sure)\n\n\n-My favorite stamping plates are from MoYou London and It Girl Nail Art (being upfront, one of my best friends owns It Girl, but they're excellent quality so I'm including her for you to check out). \n\n\nCome see us over at r/RandomActsOfPolish!

My entire career has been in DVD logo movement in one form or another. I recently authored a whitepaper that was referenced in the latest IEEE DVD-MOVE standards document and I've advised an FCC panel on DVD-MOVE and DVD-BOUNCE operations on three separate occasions. There's a decent chance my hand guided your DVD logo at some point, if you live East of the Mississippi river and you've ever suffered through an automatic DVD logo movement brownout, or you had a DVD player before 1998 when the automatic systems came on line. (I'm sure you remember the controversy about that. Never been a major outage like they feared though.)   \n\nThe straight-line options (SLO-14 specifically) was chosen in the late 90s after an industry wide meeting in San Antonio, narrowly beating out a couple of other options. (SLO-8 almost made it through, but the pixel-stutter issue killed it. It had some really elegant features that would have become useful in the Blu-Ray era though. The road not taken...) There were at least three proposals based on Lissajous or similar figures (LIS-09, LIS-AB, and ML3-O) but at that point none of them were serious contenders. The advantages of curved motion just didn't outweigh the extra costs in pixel-avoidance time or direction-of-motion double tracking. That's the famous \"2DOM problem\" you might remember being on everyone's mind briefly in August of '96, if you were paying attention to tech news at all. \n\nAnyway, yeah. I can *very confidently* say that if you've operated a legal DVD player anywhere in North America at any point in the 21st century your logo has traveled along straight lines with *no curvature whatsoever* within the mandated tolerance of 0.0023(56) grad/pixel.

The man starts drawing at a battery, and to make the lights work he has to draw a line that goes through the lights and all the way back around to the battery.  You can see the lights come on when the line makes a complete circle.  We call that circle a \"circuit.\"\n\nIn order for the lights to work though, the electricity has to have no other choice than to go through the light.  If you draw another line around the light, the electricity will be lazy and take the shortcut, and then the light won't come on.  We call this the \"path of least resistance.\"  (If he were to draw a line from one end of the battery to the other, then the electricity would be VERY lazy and it would all go as fast as it could around the lines and back into the battery.  We call that a \"short circuit\" and it's usually bad because the electricity goes so fast that it can make things catch on fire!)\n\nThe problem here is the man seems to draw a line from one end of the lights at the top to the other.  If this line is the same kind of wire as the other lines he draws, then this will give the electricity a shortcut to get from one side of the light to the other without doing any work to make the light get bright.\n\nSo the man must be tricking us.  Maybe the line he draws at the top isn't really a wire at all and just looks like one.  Or maybe none of the lines are wires and there's a switch hidden somewhere behind the paper.  Or maybe he used special effects to make it look like the lights came on when they didn't.

Then chromoly came about for lighter steel bikes, and a shift to aluminium wheels happened. Then there was aircraft grade aluminium like 6061 that started popping up, along with titanium (difficult to work with and expensive), and awesome steel like Reynolds 853. Now there are tons of carbon bicycles. I guess you could argue about the shifting changing over, but bikes are still made with derailleur styles from the 80s and bar end/downtube shifters.

Classifications can get a little weird because we're constantly trying to figure out how to fit newly discovered connections into an old framework. Sometimes names and definitions change because of situations like this. We might say \"hey this is the group of lobed finned fish!\". Then we realize \"wait a minute, what about these things that aren't fish and don't have fins...\".\n\nSo fish are what we would call a paraphyletic group. A paraphyletic group starts with one common ancester, but cuts out some of the descendants. A monophyletic group is the ideal scenario, where we have a common ancestor and all of its descendants included in a group. And polyphyletic groups are just messed up. So even though from a genetic lineage standpoint we're hanging out in the lobed fin fish group, we're not considered to be lobed finned fish.\n\nThese classifications are disputed and redefined all the time though, so I guess it might be more fair to say that it's a matter of opinion. The word \"fish\" meant something long before we had these phylogenies. So the question is, do we expand the definition of \"fish\" to fit our genetic classifications, or do we adjust classifications taking into account our original ideas of what a \"fish\" is?

The printing head had matching pole pieces which were spaced imperceptibly closer together; an \"umbilical cord\" carried the signal from the computer to the head, which could plot at 50 inches per second. We had to slow the plotting speed down to 20ips, as we were unable to find any ink with a low-enough viscosity to flow at 50ips. You had to be careful not to leave and drawing elements outside the border of your drawing, as the plotter would attempt to draw them, and the head would go flying off the plotter!

What industry would let a high performer just dick around half their day? They'll be bored and your company is wasting money. ", "id": "d2wnuen"}, {"comment": "I'll give a couple examples:\n\nI worked the backroom of a restaurant once. I had clearly defined duties (prepare this many tomatoes, this many onions...wash the equipment towards the end of the night, etc) and these duties did not increase or decrease depending on how quickly I did them. Not because of any sense of fairness to me, but simply because that's what needed to be done, nothing more nothing less. Working more efficiently did help because it allowed me to relax a bit towards the second half of my shift. \n\nCall center work: representatives are only able to take calls if there's actually people calling in - management can't make up some calls to take care of while they wait for real calls just to give them something to do. So there's a finite amount of calls coming in on any given day, and that is not going to increase or decrease depending on how efficient or inefficient the representative is. But if you can work efficiently as opposed to getting stuck on a long call, the queue can get cleared and you'll have a little more time between calls. \n\nThese are just a few random examples, I'm sure there's hundreds of them. You're right that in theory, if employees have too much free time, management will find ways to make them more productive by giving them more duties. In practice though that is a very long process. For example if you managed a small call center, if all of your employees quickly handle all the calls, they'll sit there and wait until more come in. They're not going to be \"punished\" by this efficiency by you finding more things for them to work on. What they work on is calls and that's it, no calls in queue means they get a breather. But if your call center is running successfully and your agents are able to efficiently get through calls like that, you may be in a position to take on more clients eventually giving the entire company more work to do. \n\nSo there's a difference of time frame. The employee is looking to get through the day easily. Working more efficiently will do that. Sure, the company may eventually respond to that by adding more clients or taking on more call types, but that is a much longer process that could take months or years. And if as an employee you're looking long term to intentionally be less efficient so your company can't expand and get new contracts, then you're basically working against the company at that point and that inefficiency may ultimately lead to it going out of business. \n\nMy point in all of this though is not that everyone should work as hard as possible and be as efficient as possible. My only point is that the idea of getting essentially punished for working more efficiently does not occur in every occupation, not even close. I know it can and does happen, but it's not necessarily the case, and I've worked plenty of positions where it would benefit me to get my work done quickly, instead of the other way around. Think of those where things are made to order, or those where you can't really stock up on items - service industry, certain restaurant positions, warehouse positions, etc, where you have no ability to \"get ahead\" because you must wait for a new order, call, or meal.

If there was a few percent (by weight) of moisture in the soil (like 2-5%), the apparent cohesion from the moisture would cause the sand to clump and hold closer to the person's foot instead of causing the cool \"ripple\" effect that radiates away from the foot.\n\nThird, and what I find really neat, is that I think the distance that the sand collapse radiates away from the foot is a surface expression of the stress \"bulb\" that is created by the person's footstep. And by that, I mean, the size of the circle represents how much of the earth the person is actually depressing while walking. They need engage more soil than just what's directly underneath their footprint to walk. To me, that's neat. See Boussinesq Stress Contours for more info. \n\nThere's my long-winded attempt at an explanation.

I'm not familiar with the location of this soil, but it's safe to say that it's in Australia (license plate). There's a few things that influence soil color. \n\n1) Organic Matter - not sticks and dung, but *decomposing* sticks and dung. This is why soil in the Midwest United States is brown/black. Organic matter \"masks\" other colors in the soil profile because it's so dark.\n\n2) Iron - Iron Oxides in the soil are the cause of a \"rusty\" color in the soil. Iron can be red, as seen here, or it can be grey, as seen in very wet conditions.\n\n3) Parent Material - If a soil is formed from a blue rock, the soil will be blue. If the soil is formed from sandstone, it will be sandy. These are generalizations, but the properties of soil are influenced by the rocks or source from which they originate\n\nI think here we are seeing an old soil. In general, older soils have a reddish color because of how they erode. Iron Oxides take the longest to leave a soil profile, leaving the red color on top. As for the bottom, soil profiles commonly have much lighter colors after about 20 cm deep. If I knew where this photo was, I could tell you in confidence about this specific instance, but all I can give is an opinion. The lower level could be higher in clay, as stated by u/fertro , or it could be another deposition event altogether. I'm leaning more towards more clay.

Each leaf/petal will have a slightly different distance from center, the older the leaf/petal, the further from the center, it ends up in a staggering efffect where in; if you rotated the flower so each petal pointed straight up and created an overlay, none of them would line up perfectly, it would be a steadyily increasing length from center, not 5 sets of leaves, a step, then 5 more sets.  Plants tend to spiral in this way because it is the most efficient way to get as many leaves/petals out there as possible.\n\nNote the first few centermost petals, there is a clear difference in length in each with each individual petal.\n\nIf you straightened out each spiral it would be akin to ladders that are staggered but have no rungs at the same level.(5 ladders used in example for simplicity)\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xixtvTQ.png\n\nAs where if it were actual spiral symmetry, the ladder rungs would all be level, just 5 ladders sitting next to eachother.\n\nThe cognitive mistake here is that you're processing too much data and looking for similarities, you estimate that one spiral would equal another(if the spiral continues to grow outward as we know it does), but without thinking about the timeline, you commit.  You see that there is *a* pattern, but fall for the illusion of spiral progression.  In time a given spiral would equal another from this still image, but in this freeze frame, they do not equal eachother, therefore no symmetry.\n\nIn case that doesn't make sense, I'll approach it from a different angle.\n\nTake a paper towel tube.  Mark one end of it in 1/5 of the circumference.  Now, pick one spot for a starting point.  We're going to be starting here and create new dots in a star pattern, with each dot being 1mm up from level of the last.\n\nIf you can't picture a star pattern, just go around clockwise, skip one dot and move up 1mm and mark that spot.  Move 2/5ths around(skip one dot) and 1mm up. Rinse and repeat until you've filled the tube with dots. Each dot is a leaf/petal/seed.\n\nNow, you can connect the dots in many numbers of ways to form various spirals. This is where the Fibonacci sequence comes in, just as in this Vi Hart video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0\n\nA way to visualize this with just paper is to draw a 5 pointed star and without lifting your pen begin a new star that never touches the old points that goes around the old star, ever increasing in size and go on for a ways.  You end up with what looks like a pentagon grid with spikes coming off of each plane.  That penta-grid is your base for visibly detecting different spiral patterns, you can arbitrarily pick spirals out of that, in both directions.\n\nStill too complicated, we'll start with a simpler base-2.\n\nA plant with a base of two is most often staggered thusly:\n\nhttp://img-aws.ehowcdn.com/221x332p/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/83/46/86481152_XS.jpg\n\nPlants stagger or step around a center point because it is the most efficient way to grow and still catch sunlight or a variety of other tasks.  Increasing this to 5 is just a matter of going less than 50% around the stalk/center, instead, 20%.\n\n/probably grossly mistaken on some points, but the concept is there, been struggling to find the various videos that I've gathered this from but could only find the Vi Hart one."], [3, "Not symmetry...Fibonacci."], [2, "That looks like it's near the University of Washington"], [2, "It's like that wonderful thing I decided to stop believing in when I was 8.

Each leaf/petal will have a slightly different distance from center, the older the leaf/petal, the further from the center, it ends up in a staggering efffect where in; if you rotated the flower so each petal pointed straight up and created an overlay, none of them would line up perfectly, it would be a steadyily increasing length from center, not 5 sets of leaves, a step, then 5 more sets.  Plants tend to spiral in this way because it is the most efficient way to get as many leaves/petals out there as possible.\n\nNote the first few centermost petals, there is a clear difference in length in each with each individual petal.\n\nIf you straightened out each spiral it would be akin to ladders that are staggered but have no rungs at the same level.(5 ladders used in example for simplicity)\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xixtvTQ.png\n\nAs where if it were actual spiral symmetry, the ladder rungs would all be level, just 5 ladders sitting next to eachother.\n\nThe cognitive mistake here is that you're processing too much data and looking for similarities, you estimate that one spiral would equal another(if the spiral continues to grow outward as we know it does), but without thinking about the timeline, you commit.  You see that there is *a* pattern, but fall for the illusion of spiral progression.  In time a given spiral would equal another from this still image, but in this freeze frame, they do not equal eachother, therefore no symmetry.\n\nIn case that doesn't make sense, I'll approach it from a different angle.\n\nTake a paper towel tube.  Mark one end of it in 1/5 of the circumference.  Now, pick one spot for a starting point.  We're going to be starting here and create new dots in a star pattern, with each dot being 1mm up from level of the last.\n\nIf you can't picture a star pattern, just go around clockwise, skip one dot and move up 1mm and mark that spot.  Move 2/5ths around(skip one dot) and 1mm up. Rinse and repeat until you've filled the tube with dots. Each dot is a leaf/petal/seed.\n\nNow, you can connect the dots in many numbers of ways to form various spirals. This is where the Fibonacci sequence comes in, just as in this Vi Hart video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0\n\nA way to visualize this with just paper is to draw a 5 pointed star and without lifting your pen begin a new star that never touches the old points that goes around the old star, ever increasing in size and go on for a ways.  You end up with what looks like a pentagon grid with spikes coming off of each plane.  That penta-grid is your base for visibly detecting different spiral patterns, you can arbitrarily pick spirals out of that, in both directions.\n\nStill too complicated, we'll start with a simpler base-2.\n\nA plant with a base of two is most often staggered thusly:\n\nhttp://img-aws.ehowcdn.com/221x332p/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/83/46/86481152_XS.jpg\n\nPlants stagger or step around a center point because it is the most efficient way to grow and still catch sunlight or a variety of other tasks.  Increasing this to 5 is just a matter of going less than 50% around the stalk/center, instead, 20%.\n\n/probably grossly mistaken on some points, but the concept is there, been struggling to find the various videos that I've gathered this from but could only find the Vi Hart one.", "id": "d6u4ox7"}], [{"comment": "Not symmetry...Fibonacci.", "id": "d6ukf0x"}], [{"comment": "That looks like it's near the University of Washington", "id": "d6tuipp"}], [{"comment": "It's like that wonderful thing I decided to stop believing in when I was 8.
