Didn't expect this to blow up! \n\nHere's more info:\n\n- The [shelving unit](http://m.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/spr/99047697/) is sturdy - holds up to 44 pounds! I don't habitually place my entire body weight or lean on the battle station when I do my make up, but if you're interested in getting this unit and you usually do lean onto your station, this may be a problem!\n- The white bin with the pallets inside is also from Ikea. I happened to have an old tiny divider from my actual OFFICE desk that I wasn't using, (you can't see it in the picture) but it's in the bin too because it coincidentally fit perfectly - I keep tinier little things in there, like eye liner/gel pots.\n- The center glass bin I found at HomeGoods.\n- Not sure where the elephant came from, was a gift from husband but maybe urban outfitters! \n- I think it's essential to have multiple, and bright lighting sources. The overhead lighting works well (you can optionally use it with batteries or plugged into an outlet). But ultimately I want something up close to my face and bright, cause I'll take the most help with blending I can get! Hence, I have both the overhead and 7x led magnification mirror (yes, it is suctioned on top of the [big square mirror](http://m.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/art/00223524/) ). \n", "id": "d8rs51b"}, {"comment": " What about that cute elephant?

I'd make sure to bring your blush, some translucent powder (not HD silica powder), your lip color and several other shades if you decide to vamp it up for a specific outfit to get a bigger range of looks.  I suggest bringing blush because depending on if the photographer is using flash, strobes, constant, or natural light, sometimes blush can get a bit washed out (especially with flash/strobes) so it's good to have it available to add a little bit more color.  Non-HD powder and/or blotting papers for tamping down the little bit of shine that can happen if you're under constant lights or get a little warm, no need to powder your entire face but it's good to have it available if you get any hot-spots.  \n\n\n\nOh!

I'd make sure to bring your blush, some translucent powder (not HD silica powder), your lip color and several other shades if you decide to vamp it up for a specific outfit to get a bigger range of looks.  I suggest bringing blush because depending on if the photographer is using flash, strobes, constant, or natural light, sometimes blush can get a bit washed out (especially with flash/strobes) so it's good to have it available to add a little bit more color.  Non-HD powder and/or blotting papers for tamping down the little bit of shine that can happen if you're under constant lights or get a little warm, no need to powder your entire face but it's good to have it available if you get any hot-spots.  \n\n\n\nOh! Also bring a straw ;)  I provide them to clients because otherwise it's super easy to get dehydrated just by avoiding drinking because you don't want to mess up your lip color.

Are you using a base shade on top of your primer or just throwing your eyeshadows down directly on top of the primer? Doing that without a base shade will make blending much harder 99% of the time since the primer will cling to the eyeshadow like glue. Good brushes also really help! Good does not equal expensive though, so don't think that you need all MAC or IT cosmetics brushes or something like that. \n\nIf you're having problems with your eyeshadow looking like one shade in the end, you might be over blending. I usually tell people that they need to blend until their arm feels like it's going to fall off, but depending on the look (like in this case where a soft but notable gradient is wanted) it's less about blending the heck out of everything and more about packing on the right amount of product in the right spot, and then *carefully* blending just at the median of two colors to create a seamless transition. It's more about precision in this case. If I were doing a full blown smoky eye, though, then my blending would probably look a bit more reckless! haha. Also, it's important to repeatedly add small amounts of product rather than going in once with a brush loaded with a dark color. If you're trying to blend out a bunch of loose powder, it's going to get everywhere and will definitely turn your eyeshadow \"murky\". By adding small, controlled amounts (and my small I mean dabbing your brush down lightly, once, into the pan and working with that amount) you have a much better chance of keeping your visible gradient! \n\nHopefully some of that made sense!

I do not have to set it with a powder (something I usually always have to do).

The fact its not 100% organically being created by my own body doesnt take from the fact this is the current state of my body.\n\nI get what you're saying. Its not like she has amazing genes and a dynamite skin care routine. There's other factors at play and those should be talked about just as openly. I just dont like the idea that cosmetic procedures detract from the aging process.\n\nYes,  She's using fillers and botox. That's totally cool. I don't think it adds an asterisk to her aging gracefully at all. A lot of women utilize those same methods and end up looking a bit plastic. Some women dont use those methods at all and look a bit more haggard in the eyes, brow, and mouth. \n\nRegardless of how we choose to go down the path of aging, michelle is definitely doing it in a way that looks better than 97% of people. \n\nIf anyone had asserted she's aging *naturally* then I'd be like, lol wut. But since nobody was discussing her *methods* for aging gracefully, just that she was, what you said seemed like an unnecessary put down. Like 'yeah, she's beautiful but she's had work done'. Who cares *how* she achieved it. What she's achieved is super enviable regardless.\n\nShe also has benefited from the professional makeup and hair artists and stylists and trainers who have also aided her in becoming a goddess. None of that detracts from the facts:\n\nLike many wealthy women in the public eye, michelle has made looking good a priority. And the woman looks fantastic. And I am jealous because I will never have a team to goddess transform me like shit has. But god almighty do I congratulate her on the makeover.

Trans activism and visibility increased tenfold in the mid 2010s thanks mainly to Caitlyn Jenner. In an era of growing acceptance for transgender people, it is important for many of us to show that we are no different than any other people our gender. The gay community benefited from visibility so us trans folks are following the same approach.\n\nI am confident that just as we don't call them \"interracial\" marriages anymore, and just as we will soon be moving away from the term \"gay\" marriage, trans women of the future will be referred to as simply women.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold haha! :D\n\nEdit 2: Grammar, also better clarified some of my points.", "id": "czedtar"}, {"comment": "Excellent answer.

Work with a small amount of shadow to start, blend like CRAZY, and then as you become more comfortable, pack some more on.

I've had areata for about ten years.", "id": "d3xc5u8"}, {"comment": "I was diagnosed with areata at ten but was showing symptoms starting at age six. My loss spots never got bigger than two inches around, and stress usually triggered them. I was a high anxiety kid (and young adult) so the shed phases could be easily timed with finals, job interviews, etc. About one month after the stressor passed, my newest spot would appear. I did cortisone injections directly into the patches on my scalp for many years, and applied the topical clobetasol solution to the spots nightly.\n\nI technically still only have alopecia areata because the diagnosis never really changes (according to my derm at the Cleveland Clinic, anyway). So when I was 25 I was convinced to go through braces a second time, along with a palette expander, TADS, two tooth extractions, and three years of orthodontic irritation. However, for the first part to work as an adult (palette expander), I had to have a corticotomy on my jaw bones to loosen the upper palette thus making the expander work quickly and effectively. Opting out of this surgical option would have meant a full year of an expander which would probably cause a whole host of other issues like gum erosion. So, I said sure, surgery it is. I had never been put under anesthesia (was awake for my wisdom teeth removal) so this was my first real surgery. It all went well but many people lose hair about six months after undergoing anesthesia. Since I'm blessed with a confused immune system, my body went into a total shed. I shaved the rest of my hair in July 2013 since I looked like I had mange and have been repping this look ever since. Wigs are fun but itch like hell so I can't be too bothered.\n\nLong story but I like telling it, I suppose. Every alopecia case is different, and there is no guarantee you will ever go full shed. There are a lot of research projects currently on the effect of immunosuppressants on alopecia patients (including chemotherapy to \"kill\" the immune system and start from scratch) that are promising. The FDA may even approve some of the rheumatoid arthritis treatments for alopecia in the future. Not a bad time to be going bald, really.

The side effects are closer to the \"you have no immune system so don't get sick/cuts/go in the sun because you will get pneumonia/horrible infections/melanoma\" side of things.

In my experience, once the alopecia starts, it doesn't really matter what the trigger was because it's going to run its course (whatever that may be for you).

I developed asthma when I was 18, and when I started the daily inhaler that seemed to set off some regrowth (which promptly fell out a few months later).  I also have year-rounnd seasonal allergies and eczema, and I have found that not all four of them flair at the same time; ie right now my eczema is awful, my allergies are a wreck, but my asthma is totally manageable and my lashes are growing back a bit.\n&nbsp;\n\nI had very dark hair and when I did have spots, I used some sort of scalp concealer (it had a very thin, paint-like texture) to help hide the patches.

Is there another reason that the small product is less expensive per oz?", "id": "d562j5e"}, {"comment": "I think there are a lot of different reasons why companies might choose to make travel sizes cheaper or more expensive per oz. \n\nWhy cheaper: \n\n* People are more likely to try a product if it costs less - the cheaper travel size serves as a sort of advertisement for the full size\n\n* Promotions - some of the travel size products (and jumbo sizes) are limited-edition or online-exclusive or what-have-you; again, this can serve as a sort of advertisement for the brand\n\n* Some travel-size products have cheaper packaging (e.g. a plastic squeeze tube for the Clinique lotions vs. a glass pump bottle) \n\nWhy more expensive:\n\n* People don't always look at the unit price - companies might just be banking on consumers not noticing how much more expensive the travel size is per oz  \n* Packaging (and not product) comprises a greater proportion of the cost (especially for products where the travel-size packaging is just a miniaturized version of the full size) \n* You're paying for the convenience\n\nCould go either way: \n\n* Consistency: DevaCurl seemed pretty committed to making all their travel-size products $9 for 3oz (with one exception), which meant the price per oz was anywhere from 10% cheaper to 80% more expensive than the full size. The Smashbox photo finish travel primers are all $15 even though the full-size prices vary, making the Blemish Control travel size a better deal (24% off) than the original (11% off). \n\n* A lot of what you pay for in any case isn't product - you're also paying for the development of the product, the advertising, the packaging, etc. so the company can afford to play around with pricing for different sizes ", "id": "d564hvc"}], [{"comment": "this post is only made better by your user name", "id": "d562ysn"}], [{"comment": "Some travel size packaging leaves more % of the product in the nooks and crannies vs full size", "id": "d563h8h"}], [{"comment": "This will prob get buried, but thank you so much!

(He's not telling the name of the store, however!!!) Basic essentials also include a white rice powder from Tokyo's Woolworth's equivalent; Indian kohl -- usually in black -- for his eyes, which he smudges right along the lash line and sometimes a bit on the outside...\n\n> He also uses a very light liquid base, sometimes white -- sometimes pink or yellow -- and applies it with a damp sponge. For stage, David will often use an irridescent base, usually pure white. When he paints that gold circle on his forehead that's such a hit with his fans he uses a German gold base in cake form bought at New York's Makeup Center. (He also told us that the little Japanese brushes that the Makeup Center has for applying powders and paints are much better than anything you can find in Japan!)\n\n> Eight hour cream by Elizabeth Arden is what you'll see shining up David's lips and eyelids in photographs, it gives that extra-gloss effect. And a must is that old-fashioned black mascara, (sometimes blue) -- you know the kind that you spit on the little brush and its in cream/cake form... David will often paint waves of color all the way across his eyes and eyebrows, rather than on the lids only -- usually in a pink or mauve tone.\n\n> In his last few English concerts, Bowie painted tiny lightning streaks on his cheek and upper leg. Once in awhile he uses pearlized gloss on his lips in a tan/pink that comes across like a white-silver highlight.\n\n> And -- a warning! He doesn't use glitter too much, because it falls into his eyes when he's performing and it just isn't soft looking enough, he feels. Sometimes he will outline that gold circle in tiny gold rhinestones, stuck on with eyelash glue.\n\n> As far as off-stage makeup is concerned, David doesn't wear any base; he uses a light natural moisturizer with rice powder dusted on top -- but most often he prefers to show his very light, bare, clear English skin..."], [143, "Damn, that mascara that you spit on the brush.

(He's not telling the name of the store, however!!!) Basic essentials also include a white rice powder from Tokyo's Woolworth's equivalent; Indian kohl -- usually in black -- for his eyes, which he smudges right along the lash line and sometimes a bit on the outside...\n\n> He also uses a very light liquid base, sometimes white -- sometimes pink or yellow -- and applies it with a damp sponge. For stage, David will often use an irridescent base, usually pure white. When he paints that gold circle on his forehead that's such a hit with his fans he uses a German gold base in cake form bought at New York's Makeup Center. (He also told us that the little Japanese brushes that the Makeup Center has for applying powders and paints are much better than anything you can find in Japan!)\n\n> Eight hour cream by Elizabeth Arden is what you'll see shining up David's lips and eyelids in photographs, it gives that extra-gloss effect. And a must is that old-fashioned black mascara, (sometimes blue) -- you know the kind that you spit on the little brush and its in cream/cake form... David will often paint waves of color all the way across his eyes and eyebrows, rather than on the lids only -- usually in a pink or mauve tone.\n\n> In his last few English concerts, Bowie painted tiny lightning streaks on his cheek and upper leg. Once in awhile he uses pearlized gloss on his lips in a tan/pink that comes across like a white-silver highlight.\n\n> And -- a warning! He doesn't use glitter too much, because it falls into his eyes when he's performing and it just isn't soft looking enough, he feels. Sometimes he will outline that gold circle in tiny gold rhinestones, stuck on with eyelash glue.\n\n> As far as off-stage makeup is concerned, David doesn't wear any base; he uses a light natural moisturizer with rice powder dusted on top -- but most often he prefers to show his very light, bare, clear English skin...", "id": "cyultim"}], [{"comment": "Damn, that mascara that you spit on the brush.

So clearly, I'm in a late-learning phase here.\n\nFirst off, this is amazing and I'm like so close to just taking notes or making some kind of diagram, this is gorgeous. My main question is this...I have never heard of setting spray, is this something I need? I tend towards slightly oily skin, and I know I have to use eye primer or eyeshadow does a magic trick and disappears within an hour or 2. Wondering if setting spray is something similar to help keep stuff in place for the whole face, as that's what it sounds like.\n\nEdit: got all excited and forgot my second question. It looks like you used a liquid lipstick, do you feel like those dry you out at all?

And okay as for my hair, it's kind of a lot to explain...but I do get it done professionally and I am actually in cosmetology school so I will get into it if you're interested. Also I think I'm required by some sort of code of cosmetology to tell you that you [probably shouldn't use box dye](http://confessionsofacosmetologist.com/2012/01/27/10-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-use-box-color/). But for real you do you.\n\nSince my hair is so dark I first bleached my hair to about a level 8, and then we put TIGI color on it, basically the reddest swatch available, and added a copper booster. [This was the day we dyed it](https://www.instagram.com/p/5LbwYVMegB/?taken-by=makeupbyerinelk). It faded out pretty orange which was basically the goal of adding the copper booster. I let it fade and grow out for FAR too long (like four months) and then re-bleached the roots and added more red to the top and then combed it through to the bottom. That was using the Matrix Socolor line and I didn't really like it as much. That was in October. So the color you see is kind of the result of a long process including fading, and with reds you pretty much have to be okay with that unless you want to dye it like every 3 weeks. Oh also I only wash my hair once a week. That helps a ton with reds. Anyway, story over.

How do you get through a whole week? did you just have to put up through an oily period or do you use dry shampoos at all? I really really want to have my color look as breathtaking as yours (usually I go for more natural red but I found myself staring at your \"day of\" dye and feeling things I've never felt- and wondering if I could pull off that color!) \n\nI would love to hear any advice you have! :) \n\nP.S.: I LOVE the tutorial and will be using it for my next date night! thank you so much for sharing it!", "id": "cxw9hm5"}, {"comment": "Not OP but also a cosmetologist who does red - dry shampoo is the best invention ever.

So dry shampoo is my best friend on my bangs, but I don't use it a lot elsewhere on my head because on my \"dirtier\" days, I style my hair up. My hair has been as short as shoulder length and as long as my waist and so I do not buy your excuses when you say your hair is too short for updos ;) \n\nPonytails I generally stay away from unless they are MESSY, because when your hair is greasiest, it will look so much worse when it is brushed through, so I embrace the hobo look and don't brush my hair on those days. Curling hair also makes it look less dirty as volume = less visible grease, but generally it's easier just to do it up.\n\nPinterest should be your friend! Purely for their hairstyles if nothing else. Pinterest shows you EVERYTHING from the simplest braid to absolutely outstanding updos, and you can work your way up to that with the step by step tutorials. No excuses! So on my dirty days, lots of braids are a good thing, messy buns, and backcombing, and I tend to scroll through Pinterest for inspiration. \n\n\nLastly, your hair needs to get used to not being washed as frequently but it will happen- don't expect your hair to magically look less greasy in two weeks when you start to wash it less. Your hair OVER produces oils when you are stripping them out by washing frequently, so it takes a while for this to calm down when you start washing less, but it will happen!

I tend towards slightly oily skin, and I know I have to use eye primer or eyeshadow does a magic trick and disappears within an hour or 2. Wondering if setting spray is something similar to help keep stuff in place for the whole face, as that's what it sounds like.\n\nEdit: got all excited and forgot my second question. It looks like you used a liquid lipstick, do you feel like those dry you out at all?

Purple you might be able to manage with a lvl 7. These are all quite light blonde. \n\nBeyond that, not all bright colors are the same. IDK what your stylist is using, but they're coming out too fast. There are two ways you could go with this. I adore the *Pravana Vivids* line. They do come out a little faster than other colors, but they don't fade to weird colors, they just wash out while staying true to color. This I like. SFX and Directions are also pretty alright. Raw Color and Manic Panic also last alright, but Manic Panic fades out really weirdly. \n\nOnly use cool water on your hair. Try to shampoo less, every other shower, or about 3 times a week. Definitely use an SLS free shampoo. Aveeno makes an okay one, and Biolage Matrix has one (the Keratindose) but it's kind of expensive.  You can still do a normal shower, but keep your hair dry until the very end, rinse it, and just use conditioner. If you find your scalp still gets greasy, you can use dry shampoo in between. Garnier and Big Sexy Hair both have some good ones. Some people suggest \"no poo\" but that really only works on certain hair types (naturally black or dark brown, thick, coarse hairs.

It'll seem like it's way too high at first, but when you are looking straight at a mirror, it'll look normal. \n\n3. Matte neutrals look the best imho. I've tried doing bright colors, but you don't have much real estate with hooded eyes, so it can be tricky to blend correctly.\n\n4.

I find this looks amazing and beautiful and would love to use them as inspiration for my wedding (I don't plan on going this extreme, I'm on a budget). How can I incorporate these styles respectfully? ", "id": "cz97oh7"}, {"comment": "From your wording, I'm assuming you're not Indian and are worried about cultural appropriate? Let me know if I'm interpreting that incorrectly because obviously that would change my answer.\n\nFor me, appropriation most irks when people wholesale lift elements from the culture, mostly for the sake of their own aesthetic (ie as a way to appear more exotic). It's kind of like watching someone wear your skin as a costume. My recommendation to avoid that is to pinpoint exactly what it is you like about these looks. Is it the color, the textures, the jewelry, the shapes? There's a wealth of details to identify, and the more specific you can be about what you like and why you like it, the better you can figure out how to integrate these details into your wedding without looking like you're trying throw a whole Bollywood affair.\n\nSo here are some hopefully more helpful suggestions:\n\nOne of the things people notice first with Indian styles are the colors. We often wear bright, saturated colors (I tell my friends that in India, fuschia is a neutral color). Our designs often have high contrast (ie a magenta sari with bright green trim), and are also frequently decorated with gold details or accessorized with gold jewelry. These colors can easily be incorporated into your decor. Something I could easily see with this album is if there's an outfit that particularly stands out to you, maybe you can look into flowers or settings that are similar colors. \n\nIf you're looking for things you can wear, I think the key is to be subtle about what you incorporate so that it doesn't look like you're trying to wear a costume. Wearing a bindhi down the aisle isn't particularly subtle if you're not south Asian. Neither is wearing some of the large jewelry pieces that involve nose rings and head pieces. But gold jewelry is very common, and I think things like gold bangles and layered gold necklaces can give you some of that ostentatious gold that is part of the tradition without looking like a ripoff. Jewelry is also another great place to incorporate color.\n\nIf you like saris, maybe finding dresses with a lot of drape or similar shapes can be good too. I wore a mermaid style dress for my western ceremony, which actually has kind of a similar fit as a sari in some ways (tight through the hips, flare at the bottom). Or if you like the longer lehengas (skirt/top), you can find a dress with a similar long dramatic flare from the waist. If you're open to having a non-white dress, that's another great way to incorporate some of the colors you may like. Or even if you do want a white dress, you can easily get a belt off Etsy with colors and gold trim that might reflect either patterns or colors you like.\n\nI hope this makes sense. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n", "id": "cz99ig5"}, {"comment": "That was exactly what I needed!

I won't lie I have my nose pierced so the jewelry she was wearing did catch my eye but I see exactly what you're saying. \n\nHowever, I wasn't looking to make the style a theme and 'dress up.'

If I remember correctly, she said usually for unmarried girls, the nose jewelry is usually small. They can be more ornate or expensive depending on family status and wealth.

Personally I actually feel the opposite way. If I see a non-Indian woman wearing a sari/podavai or shalwar kameez or whatever, *properly*, the whole nine yards (ha! a literally appropriate idiom!) with the hair done to match and the correct kind of blouse and everything, I am *impressed.* Really impressed. It makes me want to go to them and say how much I respect the effort they put into learning about our culture (and ask what the occasion is). If you learn about the clothing within its cultural context, and the traditions and history that go with it, and you like it enough to want to do it yourself, there is no possible way I could call that disrespectful.\n\nUltimately I think what you can take from this is that different Indians have different perspectives! To be honest, if your goal is to not offend anybody, that may not be possible. Almost anything you do will probably offend somebody, so you can't really go about life worrying too much about it. If your question is just how to be respectful, though, then no matter what you wear you've already reached that goal! Because, in the words of Albus Dumbledore, you just asked that question.\n\nI say do your wedding how you want and have a good time with it.

Most of my patients had a lot more money then I did as a grad student.  I heard some crazy stories from one patient who was a security guard for a gated community and he said one of the ladies that lived there spent $30k on her landscaping a week. \n\nI had to learn thin as a consequence of my eye shape as well as because I wanted to wear winged liner all the time.  I don't know if it could look as subtle on someone with rounder less deep set eyes but it does on me. So much of what works is EXTREMELY eye shape dependent. I have blonde hair and blonde lashes and while mascara helps I'm not willing to wear fake lashes to get the effect I want so I typically do it with a tightline and a thin wing because it gives me the illusion of having darker lashes.  I usually don't even line more then halfway in towards my inner corner.  I'm horrible at taking pictures that show my makeup well so below are a few google images of how it looks on me:\n\n[Similar eye shape to mine, narrow but not really hooded](http://slideshow.tcmwebcorp.com/slideshow/1/fr/21312312321/medias/slide/3693)\n\n[About the thickness I do for work but I wear more shadow](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/FD-bJGfCXjY/hqdefault.jpg)\n\n[Great example](http://bethbenderbeauty.com/media/wysiwyg/classic-cat-eye-makeup-looks.jpg), note on the right image how the line starts about halfway in.  \n\nI typically achieve this with a steady hand and a brush tip liner.  I am a die hard fan of the Kat von D Liner in Trooper because its brush tip and incredibly precise and it lasts all day on my oily lids.  Felt tip eyeliners are too thick for me to get it this thin and precise with.  I did wear Stila in the past and could get away with a bit thicker line at work similar to what you had in your picture but I don't prefer it, but it was the best I could do with that style pen.  \n\nMy face shape is more square (wider and angled) but my eye and lip shape is incredibly similar to [Taylor Swift's](http://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2015/02/08/taylor-swift-grammys-5.jpg) (little girls tell me I look like her all the time) and I find having narrow eyes and bigger lips I can usually go bold on my eyes and get away with it so long as my lipstick isn't too dark or bright.  People rarely notice my eye makeup unless its something really intense like [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/1b/bf/d8/1bbfd8f964b3eada3467a5d7647a41ac.jpg) but I always get noticed for lipstick, even in natural colors because my lips are pretty big in comparison to my eyes (your features are more balanced then mine because your eyes are much more round) .  I 100% cannot pull off the bold lip natural eye look for that reason because they overpower all of my other features.

I've never actually tried it with a brush although I did buy an ELF liner brush to use with my Jeffree Star lipsticks if I ever get inspired to use them as liners.

I love doing thin liner because its subtle enough for work, it conserves my limited eyelid space for more color, and it allows my wings to be very precise.

Microblading actually doesn't even focus on the pigment portion, as a matter of fact an infant could do the pigment part. They focus on first of all being able to shape eyebrows - something most tattoo artists (especially male ones) don't know the first thing about, secondly - natural hair growth pattern, again - not exactly a traditional tattoo artists forte.   Next it requires the person to slice the hairs, using basically a pen blade - which is why I said a calligraphy skilled individual would win- it requires pressure change to create a natural looking hair in a single stroke,\nThick base thin tip, one stroke- something tattoo artists would never do in their normal gig.  The final step is rubbing pigment into the cuts - something an infant could do. Literally.   I'm not sure why we are arguing about the term \"tattooing\".

They all look the same to me minus a couple shades. So lipstick shopping always makes me want to cry because I can't tell any of the shades apart and if it's red, pink, brown... so I also have no clue if it looks good on me in the real world like it does in my color messed up reality.

It only had two colors in the pallet to me so I didn't even bother. The ABH Modern Renaissance pallet I have similar issues with some some of the shades.

I own some very nice pallets and copied your guys' tutorials and YouTube ones. I can't ever get it right, and even if I did I wouldn't know because everything looks the same. So imagine blending. I will think it's blended because all the shades look the same. \n\nSo many arguments with my SO and kid about what color something is. I only do it now to annoy him.

The contrasts won't be profound, unless it's a night look or a costume, generally speaking, or unless it's accentuating a feature that already contrasts with other features (brows come to mind). \n\nIdeally, no one perceives color differences in your makeup from day today because in a harmonious everyday look, your lip color shouldn't be so visually distinct that people see it and consciously say \"wow her lips are orange-red, and yesterday they were berrywine!\"\n\nThey notice that you look good, that you're put together, that you're aesthetically interesting and enjoyable to look at, that you look healthy, that you look happy, festive, seasonal, whatever it is that you're trying to accomplish with your makeup. But they shouldn't be paying so much attention that they've amassed a mental catalog of your lip colors. If you're doing everyday makeup right, it's not obvious enough to catalog -- *even when* you're wearing unconventional colors. \n\nThe exceptions to this are whenever someone else who also loves makeup looks at you, or if your everyday look is a bit more complex, bold, and/or eccentric.

I know that there are a million other amazing YouTubers out there that also do this, but those two in particular I feel I have learnt the most from. \n\nAnother good YouTuber is Tati, who is really good at reviewing a really broad range of makeup products. As she states very explicitly in her videos, she can only review them relative to her own skin type, but if you are able to get a bit of a sense of what your skin is like relative to hers (by trying out samples at makeup stores) then you can get a pretty good sense of what particular products will work for you based on her reviews (and because she does both drugstore and high end products you are able to know where you can save money and what items are worth a little extra :) )\n\nI think as well the fact that I was doing both drag makeup and just normal makeup (like the photos above) really helped to compliment one another. For example I think I was able to grow more confident over time in both shaping and filling in my brows in normal makeup because I was simultaneously growing confident at painting entirely new brows onto my face in drag (I'm still terrible at it, but at least I confidently paint on terrible brows now :P ), so if you have a free afternoon, lotsa time to spare, and are ok with looking really weird the first few times, I would totally recommend giving a bit of drag a go in order to just completely experiment and play around with using products to make looks you'd never normally try on yourself and use products in ways that you wouldn't do normally just to see what works, what doesn't, and what is just a lot of fun :)\n\nSorry for the essay there, I get a little excited at the prospect of helping others find ways new ways to enjoy makeup :P \nHope something here proves useful! :)", "id": "d92k3im"}, {"comment": "We have the same exact taste in YouTube makeup channels!

Seriously though, beautiful work, agreed that it's probably my favorite drag look I've ever seen -- including the ones I personally applied!

As for the lashes I think they definitely are a little different, but it was the left (right in the photo) that I was having trouble with, oddly enough!

(I wouldn't be shocked if blending _down_ on your cheeks is easier than blending _up_ for the same reason; you have a cheek shadow before you even get started.) \n\nI _also_ like to contour my nose with mixed-color powders on a small brush, and find that things do get snagged a little and seem to build up into a harsh line. It's not very obvious in person, because it's not like my nose has right-angles, but it shows up in photographs. My solution has been to pat light colors on top of the line (not much!) and blend outward in each direction so I don't muck up the highlight.\n\nI hope I'm explaining this OK; you're one of those people who is not only talented at your actual art, but gifted at explaining it, so I feel really silly telling you what I do.

", "id": "da7rwwx"}, {"comment": "First I use an angled liner brush to line ABH Brow Dip (in Medium brown for me) along the bottom of the brow but I avoid the inner edges of my brows because that's where they're the most sparse (my entire brows are sparse in general) and if i use the dip brow on those parts it makes the inner corners look too boxy and obviously filled in. So i start RIGHT after the inner part and line the bottom of the brows then use the brush to spread the product upward and fill in the entire brow with the color, I brush it upwards so that the top part of the brow isn't like too crisp and sharp (I personally don't like the crispness of instagram brows). \n\nNext, I use Benefit's Gimme Brow (in 5 for me) and rake it through the inner edges of the brow where I have no product. I find that microfiber gels are so good for this because they give them a way more natural look. I kind of rake it through the entire brow as well but I mostly just use Gimme Brow for the inner corners. \n\nThen, I use the ABH Brow powder duo in chocolate or ebony (depending on the day, some days I like my brows a little darker and some days I like to make them a little more subtle). The duos usually come with the color they say they are and then a lighter version of that color, so i like to use the brush to kind of mix both the powders together in the pan because they're split in one pan, I kinda mix them around because it's creates a more neutralized and natural version of the color with the lighter powder mixed into the darker one, and then pat them over my brows with the angled brush, usually perfecting the tail of the brows in this step because it looks more natural to have a sharp tail with powder than with dip brow. \n\nLastly I use the ABH brow wiz pencil to just fill in any space that the brush might not have lined perfectly. It's a super skinny pencil so it really just is for the bottom edge of the brows to create a more uniformed and straighten them out if they turned out uneven or crooked. This step is kind of like fine tuning anything that didn't turn out right. I use the corresponding shade to my powder, chocolate, because using a pencil too dark will just look very obviously drawn on. \n\nOk that's all :) and mind you I have EXTREMELY sparse brows naturally \ud83d\ude02 for reference here's a pic of my natural brows \ud83d\ude02 https://imgur.com/a/FbZ2p  VERY different, I know.

I use Modern Renaissance's Raw Sienna as my transition shade, then use Tempura on the main lid and put Warm Taupe over it and blend Tempura with my transition shade a little bit more. Then I use Too Fave Natural Matte palette's Chocolate Cookie shade in my crease to add some depth. I have hooded eyes so i keep my eyes open when blending and just blend a lot and add back color to areas that need more and blend out in areas that look too dense.

My HG foundation was always Marc Jacobs Re(marc)able which is EXTREMELY heavy coverage and super matte and I went from wearing that on a daily basis to this CC cream.

So I switched to this within the past few weeks and am in love. It smells really good too! It works as such a nice base, I use it as foundation now and just put concealer and stuff as I usually do and it just gives my face such a clean, finished, fresh feel/look. I'm one of those people that needs to do my whole face for most events (unless I'm just bumming it to go to class lol) and I was scared to try a CC cream since I'm such a full-coverage type girl.

This quote moved me:\n\n> I\u2019ve started to view beauty as a form of self-care, instead of a patriarchal trap. One of my deepest inspirations, the writer and activist Audre Lorde, famously declared that \u201cCaring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.\u201d For many women, especially women of color, we\u2019re often told that we are only useful, only valuable when we devote ourselves to others; that caring for ourselves in the last thing that we should consider.", "id": "cz654wa"}, {"comment": "Oh my god this article has a lot of issues.

Not to mention the shady business practices of that  store -- no product testing, stealing recipes from another popular DIY store, hidden ingredients, etc. \n\nThat and framing Asian beauty routines as \"radical feminism\" has two problems: it alienates men who use Asian beauty routines, and alienates normal women who've been doing it forever. \n\nWhen we take another culture's normal, everyday routines and hail them as a quasi-supernatural \"healing\" experience, we exoticize them. And when other cultures are exoticized, we remove any possible communication as equals. It's why movies like Eat, Pray, Love are so controversial.
