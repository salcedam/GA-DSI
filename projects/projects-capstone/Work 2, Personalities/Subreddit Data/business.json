The notion that businesses provide non-portable benefits is bizarre, but Americans accept it as perfectly reasonable. It's dumb.\n\nHad these workers gotten their benefits from the government or the union, bankruptcy from the company simply means a loss of employment rather than a loss of employment, *plus* vital entitlements. \n\nThis is also why unions need to end their parasitic relationship with business and become more self-sufficient. \n\nIf it costs $24/hr to have an employee and $10 of it goes to wages while the other $14 goes to payroll taxes, healthcare and pension, isn't that dumb? Especially since your investment can evaporate?\n\nInstead, the union should demand the $24/hr go directly to them and the company provides nothing. Then the union pays the taxes, buys the health insurance, pays the sick days, vacation (and strike days), pension, etc. \n\nHow can you have collectivism when you put it the hands of a private business driven by profit principles rather than moral obligations?\n\nIn Quebec, this is a no-brainer.

"], [72, "This is a weird law. I understand that the goal is to reduce income inequality (or at least give that appearance) but this seems like not the right approach. Suppose you have two companies:\n\n* Company A pays its average worker $15/hour, or about $29K annually. A pays its CEO $2.5M, about 86X. A pays no tax penalty.\n* Company B pays its average worker $25/hour, or about $48K annually. B pays its CEO $5M, about 104X. B is required to pay a tax penalty.\n\nIn this example company B pays its average worker substantially more than company A. Suppose both companies employ approximately the same # of people and both are profitable, but company B is more profitable and thus able to pay all of its employees a higher salary or wage. In fact, it enjoys paying higher wages because B knows this will attract more talent at all levels - including its high-performing CEO which is leading the company well. Suppose both companies are looking to expand their businesses and hire more workers.\n\nBy taxing company B for its payment structure, you're hurting its ability to spend money to grow the company, giving A an advantage in the job market. This would drive down the average salaries for workers in the market. Isn't that a bad thing?\n\nSuppose company B lowers its CEO's pay to 99.99X to avoid the penalty. In at least some cases, B's CEO is going to look at that paycut and say \"I'm worth more than that, I'm going to find a better job elsewhere\". B's CEO leaves the company and moves out of town. Company B just lost a great talent and will have a somewhat harder time replacing their CEO now that they must offer a lower salary. Company B's profitability goes down as the company suffers from a weakened leadership, and eventually it must downsize and/or reduce wages. All of this is to company A's advantage, which is happy to continue offering their lower-paying jobs to the job market. Isn't that a bad thing?\n\nNow, to be clear, the example I'm illustrating is just one of literally countless situations, and you could probably devise situations where the tax penalty produced good results.

Suppose you have two companies:\n\n* Company A pays its average worker $15/hour, or about $29K annually. A pays its CEO $2.5M, about 86X. A pays no tax penalty.\n* Company B pays its average worker $25/hour, or about $48K annually. B pays its CEO $5M, about 104X. B is required to pay a tax penalty.\n\nIn this example company B pays its average worker substantially more than company A. Suppose both companies employ approximately the same # of people and both are profitable, but company B is more profitable and thus able to pay all of its employees a higher salary or wage. In fact, it enjoys paying higher wages because B knows this will attract more talent at all levels - including its high-performing CEO which is leading the company well. Suppose both companies are looking to expand their businesses and hire more workers.\n\nBy taxing company B for its payment structure, you're hurting its ability to spend money to grow the company, giving A an advantage in the job market. This would drive down the average salaries for workers in the market. Isn't that a bad thing?\n\nSuppose company B lowers its CEO's pay to 99.99X to avoid the penalty. In at least some cases, B's CEO is going to look at that paycut and say \"I'm worth more than that, I'm going to find a better job elsewhere\". B's CEO leaves the company and moves out of town. Company B just lost a great talent and will have a somewhat harder time replacing their CEO now that they must offer a lower salary. Company B's profitability goes down as the company suffers from a weakened leadership, and eventually it must downsize and/or reduce wages. All of this is to company A's advantage, which is happy to continue offering their lower-paying jobs to the job market. Isn't that a bad thing?\n\nNow, to be clear, the example I'm illustrating is just one of literally countless situations, and you could probably devise situations where the tax penalty produced good results.

This proposed tax is a government regulation that imposes a burden on private citizens and organizations, presumably in exchange for a societal benefit.* I'm asking for an analysis that demonstrates that benefit.\n\nOn the other hand, a private organization should be free to compensate its employees however it deems appropriate, and should not be obligated to provide any other private citizen or organization a \"justification\" for its behavior via the analysis you're asking for. The organization should be free to do whatever it wants so long as its activities aren't harming others. If your counterargument is: \"by paying its CEO a lot of money the organization _is_ harming people\", fine, but I would like to see the analysis that demonstrates this and thus justifies having the government penalize this behavior, and subsequently justifies this specific tax as the appropriate solution. I suspect that, at a minimum, this specific tax is _not_ the correct solution, if a solution is even needed.\n\n*By the way, that's basically what government is: An organization that imposes burdens on its citizens and organizations via laws, taxes, regulations in exchange for societal benefits. I think most people agree that various laws and taxes are necessary to support a healthy, civil, and enlightened society.

However we are doing a terrible job of making them responsible for the things that they are **genuinely** responsible for.\n\nWF seems to be a clear cut example of this : 5300 employees fired (who may struggle to find a new job), and over the years a large number of people fired for not achieving the goals that were set. These people have all paid (by their relative standards) a very large price, while the CEO and other executives, who were chiefly responsible, have retired with large fortunes intact.\n\nThe problem is that the sanctions that are currently available are almost never applied, and the penalties anyway are small compared to the rewards. Stumpf is losing ~43 million, but is retiring with an estate worth between 120 million or 1300 million, depending on whose estimate you believe. \n\nI would love to see more aggressive application of current laws, but I also think we need something extra to deal with the plausible deniability aspect\n\n1) The companies that I have worked at have had plenty of people who wanted the top job, or to climb as high as they could. I really don't think properly written legislation would change this.\n\n2) While that might be an issue for an individual European country, this is an issue where the US needs to take the lead, hopefully as a co-ordinated effort.

Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e. the state of being male, female or intersex), sex-based social structures (including gender roles and other social roles), or gender identity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender) Everyone has gender.\n\n[Dissociative Identity Disorder](http://www.healthyplace.com/abuse/dissociative-identity-disorder/dissociative-identity-disorder-did-dsm-5-criteria/) is a psychological disorder, often arising from physical or sexual abuse in the very young from their parent or guardian. The child preserves the relationship with those they are dependent upon by separating the experiences and memories of abuse from themselves. If this happens in the very young, (0-2 years) Dissociative Identity Disorder results.\n\nThe diagnostic criteria are:   \n1. Two or more distinct identities or personality states are present, each with its own relatively enduring pattern of perceiving, relating to and thinking about the environment and self.    \n2. Amnesia must occur, defined as gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information and/or traumatic events.   \n3. The person must be distressed by the disorder or have trouble functioning in one or more major life areas because of the disorder.    \n4. The disturbance is not part of normal cultural or religious practices.   \n5. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (such as blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or a general medical condition (such as complex partial seizures).\n\nNot everyone has dissociative identity disorder. In fact it is very rare.\n\n____\n\nBasically gender is about how we define with respect to masculinity / femininity, and DID is a very particular psychological disorder.", "id": "d1rtbd1"}, {"comment": "> gender is how we define...\n\nIn other words *not science or reality*.

It's a sensationalized and fear-mongering idea that appeals to some core values of Reddit unfortunately.\n\nThe reality is that corporations are smart enough to work out systems in which the consumer sees benefits (\"more streaming!!\"), the corporation sees benefits (90% of their users don't even know what Binge-On is, and are opted in and throttled by default, lowering congestion), and more importantly the carrier is given *control* over their customer's content, and even over multi-billion dollar media rivals like Google. Youtube has to play by *their* rules to get favored status, and these rules are subject to change.\n\nThis sets up a precedent which definitely has the potential to stifle innovation. I can see a future where 20 years from now we're still watching 720p content on our phones/VR goggles/whatever because the Binge-On type carrier programs mandate that media be throttled to that level or lose bandwidth-free status. Meanwhile South Korea is streaming 4k content over 6g networks which would burn our data caps in 2 minutes. I guess I'm also being somewhat sensational, but at least such a scenario is realistic. Incentives can and will be used by carriers to get what they want. They will shift data caps, pricing, and the rules of Binge-On-like programs around until they get what they want. Customer satisfaction and technological progress are just 2 variables sitting alongside infrastructure costs, corporate profit, etc. Is that the kind of equation we driving the future of our data networks?

The largest US bank and the largest Canadian bank. My job was to streamline the monitoring because it's extremely expensive investigating all these foreign transactions.  \n\nAnything sent electronically is subject. The United States owns and monitors the Internet and all transactions under the 9/11 statutes. Sending to a foreign country, especially a non-treaty, is an instant red flag that will put multiple investigators on your account. Shelter countries like Switzerland are also instant flags. Anything outside the US is essentially assigned an investigator for the very reason you wrote. \n\nThe banks will watch it for years, sometimes bringing in the DOJ if needed, digging through social media, all your bank transactions, all your public records, your friends, your mortgage, marriage, Twitter posts, picture of your business, everything. We're looking for terrorism money and if we fuck up, it's a $500m fine, freeze on all new customers, and DOJ sets up shop in the bank and your CEO goes before congress to explain why. Not to mention if we fucked it up another 9/11 could happen. \n\nThe technologies and money spent watching for this exact thing are mind-blowing. The bank will dissolve if terrorism funding is found so no expense is spared in monitoring for fraud. Most people's understanding of money laundering and movement is from Hollywood which is pretty hilarious if you step back. They saw a character in a god damn movie hide money and they think the banks and govt are oblivious to this scheme and them, as a Joe-nobody, is going to circumvent the banking system, NSA, and US DOJ with something they saw on tv.  \n\nTo put into perspective; when I left we were going 32 social contacts deep on flagged accounts. We found 32 of your most frequent contacts, looked at 32 frequents of all *those* people, and we dug and dug and watched and created heat maps and visualizations to watch where an entire network of maybe 300 people were sending money.

Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus it was much faster and more flexible. It was unambiguously a Turing-complete device and could compute any problem that would fit into its memory. Like the Colossus, a \"program\" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later. Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches.\n\nIt combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems. It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine. It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root. High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes). Built under the direction of John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania, ENIAC's development and construction lasted from 1943 to full operation at the end of 1945. The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.[37]\n\n...\n\nThe next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit. The idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the Royal Radar Establishment of the Ministry of Defence, Geoffrey W.A. Dummer. Dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in Washington, D.C. on 7 May 1952.[48]\n\nThe first practical ICs were invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor.[49] Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958.[50] In his patent application of 6 February 1959, Kilby described his new device as \"a body of semiconductor material ... wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated\".[51][52] Noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than Kilby.[53] His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not. Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium.\n\nThis new development heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to the invention of the microprocessor. While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term \"microprocessor\", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004,[54] designed and realized by Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin, and Stanley Mazor at Intel.[55]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#Digital_computer_development", "id": "d2ihmj4"}, {"comment": "\\> automakers make cars with little regard for efficiency or emissions for like half a century\n\n\\> smog so thick you can chew it\n\n\\> government establishes efficiency and emissions regulations\n\n\\> legendary smog problems of the 70s no longer as bad\n\n\\> some private companies cheat this system\n\n\\> GUYS IT'S A GOVERNMENTAL FAILURE\n\nSomewhere, this logic train got derailed.\n\n", "id": "d2hxwkq"}, {"comment": "Actually we can see much out of it, competitors can exploit this situation against Mitsubishi, i am not sure about public but competitors cannot be ruled out.", "id": "d2hu5hw"}, {"comment": "What about Toyota and vw and the rest of them?

The argument that this is state aid and was only available to Apple may be flawed as the same ruling was given on an individual basis to many other companies. This means it would not be state aid for special treatment and could be grounds for appeal.\n\nNearly all companies pay at an effective rate as oppose to the actual tax rate. This is due to differences between accounting policy's which generate a profit before tax and the tax legislation of each country. Any add backs or allowances would increase and decrease the effective rate of tax respectively. \n\nThe reason Ireland has been given such a low rate of tax is because of the 'double Irish' rule, a loop hole that has since been closed. The reason the rates are so low is the apple subsidiary company in Ireland is able to pay management charges to a head office company which is 'based' in Ireland. The office is in fact fictional which allows the company to pay no one. This means the apple sub gets a deduction and the income is not actually taxed anywhere. Giving the low effective tax rate.\n\nIreland are also appealing the ruling. It will be interesting to see what happens if they are both unsuccessful in respect of practicality as well as late payment interest and penalties, as the Irish tax authorities were happy the returns were submitted correctly so penalty payments could be argued would not apply.\n\nOne of the main reasons the US is claiming the income should not be taxed is that it is vouching that the income will be remitted back to the US. However, apple has been leaving cash in the countries they are generated, effectively trapping the cash. I am only speculating but it could be seen to.artifically inflate the share price with cash on the balance sheet, when actually it would not be able to be used without being taxed and reducing the cash available. \n\nThe EU press release was the most informative thing I read on this today.

The argument that this is state aid and was only available to Apple may be flawed as the same ruling was given on an individual basis to many other companies. This means it would not be state aid for special treatment and could be grounds for appeal.\n\nNearly all companies pay at an effective rate as oppose to the actual tax rate. This is due to differences between accounting policy's which generate a profit before tax and the tax legislation of each country. Any add backs or allowances would increase and decrease the effective rate of tax respectively. \n\nThe reason Ireland has been given such a low rate of tax is because of the 'double Irish' rule, a loop hole that has since been closed. The reason the rates are so low is the apple subsidiary company in Ireland is able to pay management charges to a head office company which is 'based' in Ireland. The office is in fact fictional which allows the company to pay no one. This means the apple sub gets a deduction and the income is not actually taxed anywhere. Giving the low effective tax rate.\n\nIreland are also appealing the ruling. It will be interesting to see what happens if they are both unsuccessful in respect of practicality as well as late payment interest and penalties, as the Irish tax authorities were happy the returns were submitted correctly so penalty payments could be argued would not apply.\n\nOne of the main reasons the US is claiming the income should not be taxed is that it is vouching that the income will be remitted back to the US. However, apple has been leaving cash in the countries they are generated, effectively trapping the cash. I am only speculating but it could be seen to.artifically inflate the share price with cash on the balance sheet, when actually it would not be able to be used without being taxed and reducing the cash available. \n\nThe EU press release was the most informative thing I read on this today.

While I tend to agree with Sanders generally, I think that argument (unless I have missed part of it) ignores the gradual intrinsic externalities of other energy sources. Solar panels are still more difficult to manufacture than tennis shoes, are made of different material, and don't last forever. If we can make waste disposal affordable for nuclear and accept that we are going to need a place to do it, along with making a few other restrictions less paranoid, there would be room in an economically viable model for a significant enough tax to cover most of insurance.

Oh yeah, this isn't /r/AskScience. \n\nFusion research is one of the few, perhaps only area of scientific study where you can literally throw money at it, and get results. That's the problem with fusion research, that's always been the problem. It's why fusion research has always been \"20 years away\". At the time, with the current funding and roadmap, it *was* 20 years away. But funding gets drastically cut, priorities change, and that changes the time table. \n\nRight now the biggest problems with fusion power is the experiments. They can only run so many tests in a day to run their models, tweaking things ever so slightly, then running them again. That's how they test the magnetic confinement of plasma, as an example. Trying to confine plasma is like trying to take a puddle of water in your hand, molding a fork out of it, then holding it. It's insanely difficult. Getting the right plasma model is simply a matter of running countless tests over and over again.That costs time and money. You throw more money at fusion and you could have feasible fusion power very quickly. But nobody is in a rush to do so because it's a long term investment with an uncertain payoff (long term as in, 50+ years). So fusion researchers rely mostly on government funding which is limited, and that funding can change with every new administration as every new administration has their own direction they want to go.", "id": "d545yr7"}, {"comment": "> It's insanely difficult.\n\nSo you agree with me, but just don't want to admit it.  And you're talking about just making a self-sustaining reaction for the first time.  I'm talking about then making the reactors cheap, affordable and practical.  Let's say we master fusion, but it still takes a huge team of extremely qualified experts to run a plant.  How many plants are we going to build?  Enough to power the world?  This is only 1 example of something that could be an obstacle to practical fusion. Emphasis on **practical**.\n\nCompare that to fission, where we currently have high school age navy kids running fleets of nuclear reactors on submarines.  Fusion is hard. Fission is easy.  Fusion has yet to achieve a self-sustaining reaction, whereas we already know for a fact that fission reactors could solve global warming immediately, for a fraction of the cost of fusion.  With the threat of global warming, billions of lives are at stake.  Which do you choose: the solution you know will work and can accurately estimate the cost, or a solution that you have no idea if it will work, and know for sure that it will be one of the most expensive engineering programs in history? And that's just to get to a working prototype.  One is sound strategy, the other is reckless wishful thinking that endangers the future of the human race.\n\n> This is flat out wrong and I don't know how it got upvoted. Oh yeah, this isn't /r/AskScience.\n\nYou clearly are letting your emotions get to you, or you don't know what the word practical means.  I DID NOT say that fusion power was impossible. And yes, this isn't r/askscience.  Not only do scientists have the luxury of staying in the purely theoretical realm, they're paid to do so.  Engineers are interested in what's most pracical and realistic, given real-world constraints, and businessmen are interested in mitigating risk when they invest, and aren't interested in throwing their money away.  Fission is proven, fusion is the most expensive gamble imaginable.  It's great and exciting fun from a science perspective though, granted, but I'm talking about the real, deadly serious problems facing our world today.\n\nI can also tell you clearly didn't watch the video, where he has [a great bit](https://youtu.be/P9M__yYbsZ4?t=3690) about just how ridiculously impractical fusion is compared to fission.\n\nWe definitely should work on fusion someday, but only after we've mastered fission.

He then profited on buying scared owners' properties lower than value & selling them at market value.\n\nThis story is true, and I didn't tell it to try and make Trump look bad.

They represent the common issue in politics where, by failing to acknowledge each other's sanity and reasoning capacity (i.e. saying the other side are dumb, ignorant or brainwashed), two sides are completely incapable of making arguments that would ever change each other's reasoning. When you write off the other side's mental capacity, you ignore the whole logical framework in their head which is going to dictate which premise you should be trying to disprove or which points of logic to focus on. Instead, people simply post things that are meaningful reiterations of their stance, which ends up looking like begging the question. It relies on agreeing with the point in the first place to appreciate the evidence supplied.\n\nIn this case, the point that will get you to like or dislike Trump is not whether he was a ruthless businessman, that he avoids taxes or that he games bankruptcy. Bringing up stories about that will change very few minds because it feeds both the Trump and the anti-Trump narratives equally. Instead, what divides the two sides is whether, in this metaphor, the \"victims\" are the American people or China, Mexico and the middle east. People who are in favor of Trump are happy to see showings that he is ruthless and can find every loophole because they see America as part of his team who will share the spoils, while foreign nations are the \"victims\" who are receiving that ruthlessness. So, to them, his ruthlessness is a sign of the strength they'd have under his leadership, making them even more supportive of him. People who are opposed to Trump believe that they'll be those victims so it's obvious that the more ruthless he is, the worse they'll have it. When you see that, it becomes clear that exposing his ruthlessness just feeds both sides and does nothing to convert either. A real argument against a Trump supporter would be (1) why it is that they should believe that as an American citizen they still won't be on Trump's \"team\" or (2) why turning foreign nations into victims will create unsustainable backlash.

Even if that means sending someone to the guillotine or forcing them eat their own children. No system is perfect. And anyone who oppose to this idea would call the action \"pandering.\"  \n\nThe hero of war from one country is the demon of death from the eyes of the opposition.  \n\nNow, it's fine that you support Elitism.

When you grant another an exclusive license, it then seems to violate that contract if you were to then put your work in the public domain while the exclusivity remains valid.\n\nIs it the case that in such circumstances the work is fully in the public domain and the only consequence is potentially contract breach damages for the creator?  Or could an exclusive license of a work prevent the work from entering the public domain?\n\nAll the posters elsewhere in the thread seem to suggest that you actually CANNOT put your work into the public domain, that it's really nothing quite so simple, and that you would need to craft a license to effect such intentions.  New works are automatically under copyright protection, and \"public domain\" is a term that applies to works that do not qualify for copyright protections\u2026", "id": "d5zc9gc"}, {"comment": "When you license a work for someone else to use, its typically not an exclusive license. Except maybe when it is something like a book where the publisher is smart and demands an exclusive use.\n\nIf you license a photo to certain people, its not impossible to then put it in the public domain. All you have to do to put something in the public domain is say that it is in the public domain. As far as I know if you cannot then take it back out of the public domain, but I am not sure. There are also ways to protect your work such that it is almost public domain but still requires credit to the creator for instance. There are several \"Creative Commons\" forms that one can use. One is called CC-NC which means anyone can use it but it cannot be used for commercial purposes. There is another CC license that only requires one to attribute the work to the original creator when it is published by someone. These are basically contracts that attach to the object being published and would be listed in the credits somehow. \n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/\n\nA creator can put his copyrighted work into the public domain at any time.

", "id": "d8xvaeh"}, {"comment": "From a recent [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/07/reverse-voxsplaining-brand-name-drugs/) post:\n\n>1. Golec & Vernon (2006) say that as a result of European drug price regulation, \u201cEU consumers enjoyed much lower pharmaceutical price inflation, however, at a cost of 46 fewer new medicines introduced by EU firms.\u201d\n\n>2. Eger and Mahlich (2014) find that among pharmaceutical companies, \u201ca higher presence in Europe is associated with lower R&D investments. The results can be interpreted as further evidence of the deteriorating effect of regulation on firm\u2019s incentives to invest in R&D.\u201d\n\n>3. Kutyavina (2010) finds that \u201cbrand-name pharmaceutical firms characterized by large R&D expenditures decreased their R&D efforts post 1993 threat [to regulate drug prices] relative to firms that did not engage in as much innovative R&D\u201d.\n\n>4. Acemoglu and Linn (2004) find that \u201cWe find a large effect of potential market size on the entry of nongeneric drugs and new molecular entities\u201d, which I think is supposed to generalize to mean that the more money they expect to make the more research they do. I will count this as half a study since the connection is not explicit.\n\n>5. Danzon & Epstein (2008) analyze price regulations and new drugs invented in 15 countries and 12 drug classes, and find that \u201cIf price regulation reduces drug prices, it contributes to launch delay in the home country.\n\n>6. Troyer & Krasnikov (2002) find that \u201cthe empirical relationship between pharmaceutical industry revenues and pharmaceutical industry innovation is estimated, allowing for an exploration of the impact of the Medicaid rebate program [which regulated drug prices somewhat]. Using the empirical results, the opportunity cost of the Medicaid rebate program is found to be as high as four new drug approvals annually. Given the increased interest in a Medicare drug benefit, regulators should be aware of the hidden cost of price regulation for pharmaceuticals.\u201d\n\n>7. Vernon (2005) finds that \u201cI simulate how a new policy regulating pharmaceutical prices in the US will affect R&D investment. I find that such a policy will lead to a decline in industry R&D by between 23.4% and 32.7%. This prediction, however, is accompanied by several caveats.\u201d\n\n>8. Golec, Hegde, and Vernon (2009) find that \u201cResults show that the HSA [a bill to regulate drug spending in the US] had significant negative effects on stock prices and firm-level R&D spending. Conservatively, the HSA reduced R&D spending by about $1 billion even though it never became law.\u201d\n\n>9. Santerre and Vernon (2006) use drug demand data to simulate various regulatory regimes, and find that a certain price regulation policy they test, continued over twenty years, would have cost gains of $472 billion (!) but also \u201chave led to 198 new drugs being brought to the US market\u201d (!!). They note that \u201cTherefore, the average social opportunity cost per drug developed during this period was approximately $2.4 billion. Research on the value of pharmaceuticals suggests that the social benefits of a new drug are far greater than this estimate. Hence, drug price controls could do more harm than good.\u201d\n\n>10. Keyhani, Carpenter, et al (2010) find that \u201cThe United States accounted for 42% of prescription drug spending and 40% of the total GDP among innovator countries and was responsible for the development of 43.7% of the NMEs [ie new drugs invented]. The United Kingdom, Switzerland, and a few other countries innovated proportionally more than their contribution to GDP or prescription drug spending, whereas Japan, South Korea, and a few other countries innovated less\u2026higher prescription drug spending in the US does not disproportionately privilege domestic innovation, and many countries with drug price regulation were significant contributors to pharmaceutical innovation.\u201d This study does not attempt to address the effects of price regulation, only to say that European countries seem to do pretty well at innovation despite price regulation, which is suggestive that price regulation does not hurt drug innovation but not really scientific evidence for it. I\u2019m going to count this one as half a study too.\n\nSo on the balance it looks like the evidence supports the idea that the high cost of US drugs largely funds worldwide R&D. I don't have a real problem with this, for two reasons.\n\n1. On-patent prescription drugs still make up a tiny fraction of overall healthcare expenditures in the US.\n\n2.

For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns.

Sometimes you'd have to cross the creek to get to the side that was easier to walk along. So my coworker and I at one point are standing on the creek bed waiting for satellite acquisition (GPS surveying) and we hear a man say \"get em.\" It was a neighbor who didn't know what we were doing, thinking we were intruders. So his two GIANT rottweilers start charging at us at full speed from about 100 yards away. We had nowhere to hide, and we knew it is a bad idea to run from dogs, so we stood our ground. I had a machete and he had a survey rod, which is like a big stick with a spear point on the end.

EDIT: I meant they are part of direct labor. Only supervisors are manufacturing overhead. Both types of wage go into the cost of the good for production. \n\nSo, if we look at a really high paid CEO as an example: \nJohn Hammergren of McKesson garners one of the highest CEO salaries in the country. A \"material handler\" at McKesson averages at 13.88 according to Glassdoor. Pre-tax, a material handler pulls down about $2,200 dollars a month, and approximately $26,500 per year. Hammergren gets $131.2 million per year from a company with a trailing twelve month net income of $1.2 billion. Based of our pre-tax figure for a material handler, and Forbes figure for Hammergren's salary: John Hammergren makes as much as 4,950 material handlers per year. \n\nNow here is the important part behind severe imbalances like this: The material handlers' wage goes into the price of the goods through direct labor. Hammergren's salary is an expense that lowers profit (lower taxable income for the company). \n\nTo please the board of a large public company you only need to drive up stock price, which means bringing in little profit is usually of no concern. Most businesses do not like to pay out dividends. They expense as much as they can, reduce taxable income, and put effort into growing the company by grabbing market share. \n\nIncreasing pay at the direct labor level means increasing costs, and prices, which might result in lost market share. The only incentive to pay direct labor better is for retention. "], [3, "None of this is surprising or new in any way.

Arguing a hypothetical that might not have a basis in reality is pointless, unless of course, you just want to convince yourself that it's absolutely morally okay to pay the majority a barely livable wage while you live an extortionist lifestyle.\n\n>For the sake of further illustration, using your example of CEO value of 60B, John the broker's value of 1m and Cashier value of 30K, let's say each is paid 50% of the value brought in. The CEO would be entitled to, no shit, 30B in pay. John, the stud, brings home 500k, and the cashier 15k. So, in this respect, that CEO is actually far, far underpaid compared to the cashier. \n\nYou keep saying value as if it is a definitive thing, when it is actually an abstract idea that may or may not be grounded in reality. This is especially true that you are not even giving us a real situation, just a conveniently perfect scenario that has a round peg that fits into a round hole. All value is entirely hypothetical, and public value is determined by the perception of value by shareholders, and by extension the public that is willing to consume the company's products/services.", "id": "d5sq2hv"}, {"comment": "No, value is very much grounded in reality when discussing business and economics. The value of an employee is literally how much wealth they generate for the company.  \n  \nYes, collectively, those cashiers are worth a more significant amount (but not necessarily a greater value than that of the CEO - because there are ways to generate value without handling the in-store transactions with customers). But nowhere was it claimed that their collective worth was less than that of the CEO.  \n  \nYou have this impression that a person's humanity adds value to the business. This is simply not how business functions from an accounting standpoint. And that's what determines a person's compensation - it's a recompense for the value added to the company, not the value added to the world.  \n  \nOh, but their own vision adds value? Well, if it adds as much value as the CEO's vision, that individual should be working their way to the CEO position, no? Even with that snark aside, the individual down the chain's value added to the company is *still* less than that of the CEO. Why? Because that individual is one stream of value that contributes to the value the CEO adds - that is, the individual's impact within the firm is far more limited in value added to the company than the vision of the CEO. This is simply a necessary fact of the corporate structure. Ignoring this is foolish for any business leader.\n  \nIf you wish to discuss the latter, this is probably the wrong subreddit to do so in. It is not the responsibility of a business to recompense a person for the wealth that individual adds to the world as a whole, rather it is to recompense the individual for the value added to the firm.\n\nETA: As for the assertion that a business cannot function without cashiers, you are categorically wrong. McDonalds, et al, are currently implementing locations where the cashier is absolutely redundant (and will likely go to nil). Walmart, and many grocery stores following suit, has for years implemented self-checkout lanes where the value of your individual cashier is reduced from a 1-1 cashier - stile to a 1-4+ cashier - stile ratio. Maybe there's an argument there about the cashier is now worth 4x as much as before - but the reality is that this cashier is generally acting as customer service and loss-prevention.  \n  \nAnd then there's Amazon's business model that has literally ZERO cashiers.", "id": "d5suh9u"}, {"comment": ">I never said to tell them that. Your projecting a villain mentality on me (an accountant). But it doesn't erase the facts. If I leave my company they will hire someone else. At an absolute worse it's a minor inconvenience and they have to overpay the next guy.\n\nI'm not projecting anything. I am saying that if you actually espoused those values in real life, if you told someone they were expendable, you would not find good company. And why would you? You would be trying justify seeing people in terms of capital as a statistic, not individual value, as a human being.\n\n>What is your solution to this? A group effort? Haha, there is no chance that would that work. I do consulting and I can't get family members to agree on things. You expect a company with 200k employees to not have a sole boss? There must be a chain of command for the company to function.\n\nThere is such as thing as a collective effort where all opinions are valued equally but are still managed by one person at the top. It's called Congress. To expand on this, when the President of a country earns less than an average CEO, the economic world has lost all sense.\n\n> And you can absolutely quantity a value a CEO brings to a company. There are literally hundreds of cases where a new CEO helps the company to prosper or crash and burn.\n\nThen why are there so many situations where a CEO does well at one company and does poorly in another? CEOs can be incidental to success. Not always, but sometimes. There are a lot of factors that basic arithmetic isn't accounting for.\n\n>If my strategy is to take my product to the internet and yours is to stay in stores we will both get very different growth rates. Who is right? Depends on your market. Teenagers? Probably the internet. Seniors? Stores. This is about as basic as I can get to show that strategy is ridiculously important (and why MBAs spend tons of time on it). Factor that times Billions of assets and you can see why the cashier is almost meaningless in terms of value.\n\nYou are creating a scenario that is entirely hypothetical and is not really conducive to demonstrating how things shake out.\n\nAnd if it takes a CEO to make that type of cut and dried decision, god help us all. We must really be complete morons, then.\n\nBut collectively, cashiers do produce more value (than some arbitrary percentage that you just pulled out of thin air especially) because you can't work the stores without cashiers, so they must have some real world value otherwise you could just pay one cashier 1000x as much to cover hundreds of stores. It's not physically possible. You need hundreds or thousands of workers to make the company function, together. That's their true value.\n\nSure, someone found a formula that paid cashiers just as much as is necessary to not have the whole system come crashing down, but that doesn't represent actual value of that person's work, ethic, or influence. Seriously, just because they have less influence individually it doesn't mean they have 0.001% of the value of a CEO. You could train a remarkable amount of people to split up the work of what a CEO does, and they could be payed a fraction of what he is payed. You could also be a secretary that gives the CEO an idea, and it ends up making the company a lot of money, but the secretary is not entitled to additional compensation for coming up with that idea. It is owned by the company. The CEO could actually be a figurehead and accomplishes nothing but still lavishes in the rewards of a hardworking CEO. It is not proportional at all, and not one situation fits all. You know how I know definitively that real value is not present? CEOs do not suffer consequences equal to their responsibility when they make mistakes. That is the true test of corporate ideology.\n\nStrict adherence to an abstract idea that a CEOs intrinsic value is x more important than y is foolish, especially when everyone down the ladder also has to execute ideas competently to make the strategy even work. There is hidden value that is not represented.

Hammergren gets $131.2 million per year from a company with a trailing twelve month net income of $1.2 billion. Based of our pre-tax figure for a material handler, and Forbes figure for Hammergren's salary: John Hammergren makes as much as 4,950 material handlers per year. \n\nNow here is the important part behind severe imbalances like this: The material handlers' wage goes into the price of the goods through direct labor. Hammergren's salary is an expense that lowers profit (lower taxable income for the company). \n\nTo please the board of a large public company you only need to drive up stock price, which means bringing in little profit is usually of no concern. Most businesses do not like to pay out dividends. They expense as much as they can, reduce taxable income, and put effort into growing the company by grabbing market share. \n\nIncreasing pay at the direct labor level means increasing costs, and prices, which might result in lost market share. The only incentive to pay direct labor better is for retention. ", "id": "d5s92zf"}], [{"comment": "None of this is surprising or new in any way.

I don\u2019t think you truly understand the sheer scale of job-loss that this wave of AI and automation is going to bring.  Let me help you with some of it using your examples:\n\n* Welding - Robots will do this faster, better, cheaper.  Yes, there is room for custom stuff in unique situations, but lay-offs from automation will drive up job demand from unemployed welders and lower wages.\n* Police - Driver-less cars are going to have WAY less accidents, and not break the law.  As well, automated systems ticketing drivers, AI within the desk jobs like dispatch, scheduling, management, etc. will all mean less cops are needed.\n* Mechanic - Electric vehicles are much simpler and have less moving parts and use few fluids.  As well, driver-less cars can be used through ride sharing services to generate income.  This means less cars are needed, and the ones that remain are simple to repair and maintain.  Not to mention automation of the repair.  A battery in a Tesla can be replaced in less than 10 minutes.\n* Repair (AC or Plumber) - Better tools will make their jobs less work.  For example, a plumber can run a remote camera down a drain pipe to quickly diagnose an issue, that involved digging up a front lawn decades ago.  As well, the lower barrier and security will mean the unemployed flock to it, thus driving up supply of tradesmen, and driving down wages and hours.\n* Medical Assistant - Automated machines to dispense meds, monitoring systems to watch patient, electric wheel-chairs to move them around, bots and AI to enable home-care.  \n\nHave a white collar job?  Yup, their fucked too.  AI is going to do a number on finance, accounting, support, legal, etc.  And like I said already, what jobs that survive in any sector are fucked too.

Moreover, in this case, the alternative (e.g., if there was no sovaldi) would be watchful waiting and eventual progression to liver transplant, which is a $400K procedure. The NPV cost of this drug to both the patient and the healthcare system is much lower. The average patient does not see the $84K pricetag, and instead pays an insurance copay/coinsurance. The entire price is budgeted into the insurance pool that the patient is a part of, with the incidence and prevalence of HIV included in the actuarial tables that determine the average cost of an insurance plan. \n\nAs a single drug, Sovaldi generated enormous revenues for Gilead, but across all of their drug programs and especially including spent R&D that yielded no revenue for the business, the revenues and profits are much lower (which is true across the industry). In addition, this treatment is the first true cure for a chronic disease. The marketing spend -- many quote that marketing spend outpaces R&D spend in the industry, it actually varies widely by company -- is to inform doctors of new advances. Yes there are some shady things that have happened in drug marketing, but doctors are fragmented in their existence and not all keep up with scientific advances.

The present value of $200,000 (discounted 3% per year for 30 years) is approximately $82,000. Would you pay $82,000 today to cure yourself of diabetes?\n\nFirst off: I just wanted to offer a counterpoint to your interesting post and hope you read this as \"an open discussion\" rather than an  \"argument\" or me challenging your post.  :)\n\nI googled \"cost of diabetes medication\" and the [first result <PDF WARNING>](https://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/Diabetes-2pager-March2009.pdf) according to that site using generic drugs and oral treatment the cost is as little as $4 a month.\n\nThis [NPR article](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/08/18/432621873/high-cost-of-diabetes-drugs-often-goes-overlooked) claims that annual treatment can be ~$15k per year or ~$1250 per month..\n\nThankfully I have no knowledge of Diabetes or the cost.. can you provide your $90 per month source?  To make an apples to apples comparison?\n\nBeyond that bit.  I have a question about this part:\n\n>Assuming the cost of having diabetes grew 10% per year..\n\nWhat is the justification of a drug costs increase of 10% per year?  The major expense in any drug is the R&D and going through the FDA approval.  Once a drug is cleared to \"go to market\" the only expense is manufacturing and marketing - this gets priced accordingly to recoup the R&D costs, FDA expenses, marketing and manufacturing..  There should not be an significant increase of the \"cost\" of the drug year over year.  Pharmaceutical companies have about 20 years to profit from their new drug until the patent expires and the drug can be copied and a generic version can be marketed. \n\nSo once we hit the 20 year mark, beyond greed, what is the major expense to justify $1500 per month?  All the R&D and FDA costs have been covered (many times over), your manufacturing cost are minimal (pennies per pill or even fractions of a cent per pill in many cases), your marketing costs for the \"brand name\" should be fixed at this point (20 years in) and for generics it will be substantially less (no TV, print ads.. just basically phara reps telling Docs about it).\n\nSo let's hypothetically say we have an established drug that is a CURE - not a treatment. One time deal..  as long as we are past the \"recoup\" stages of the profit model - why price it at $82k?  After taxes, if the sick person paid 100% of their take home pay (no rent, food, gas, vehicle expenses..etc) that is almost 3 1/2 YEARS income for the average American...The [per capita income for 2014](http://www.deptofnumbers.com/income/us/) was $28,889.\n\nSure you can argue - well isn't it worth 3 1/2 years of your income worth it to be cured?  Well, yeah I guess.  But the math doesn't work that way... If we take the average Americans income of $28,889\n\n* [Income Tax, Medicare, Social Security](http://www.taxformcalculator.com/tax/28889.html) = -$4990\n\n* Mortgage or Rental Expenses est. 50% of income = -$11,949 (this is 50% of AFTER Tax income of $23,899 per year)\n\n* Food: [Average of 13.4% of after tax income](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/detail.aspx?chartId=40096&ref=collection&embed=True&widgetId=39734) = -$3202\n\nSo the average American with a $29,889 annual income... less $5k for taxes, $12k for rent or mortgage and $3k for food.. leaves us with about $10k...\n\nWe STILL have not accounted, clothing, transportation, utilities, entertainment, savings/retirement and ALL the other daily expenses we face....\n\nSo that $82k drug is EASILY +10 YEARS of a person's life.\n\nMaybe you are lucky and this is ONLY health concern you will EVER have.. ok +10 years of 100% of ALL your disposable income to live longer.. but what if you develop something else?  Or you have a child that is sick, or you get into an accident?\n\n$XX,XXX or even $XXX,XXX for a CURE for something can easily be justified as \"it's ONLY X years income to live healthy\" - the reality of it is we don't live in a vacuum, there are OTHER necessary expenses  and many times UNEXPECTED expenses that makes this logic invalid.  Pricing something using this logic is just trying to justify greed.\n\nNow with that said: and using the SAME logic.  X# of Years income for a CURE might be reasonable if the cost of the drug was based on the individual's after tax income level..  so the cost of the treatment is directly proportional to the individual.\n\nThis could be taken advantage of my the wealthy as their reported \"income\" may be MUCH lower than their net worth.. maybe after a certain income threshold (maybe +$400k per year?) it's calculated by net worth.\n\nIn my opinion, the current pricing of many life saving drugs is 100% greed wrapped up in the warped justification of \"it's only X number of years income\"... the math of life doesn't work that way.\n\n*Please let me know if my math or anything else!

After the initial R&D and FDA testing is paid for, the actual costs of manufacturing and distribution are minimal.  This is true of most any industry reliant on new \"inventions\".. yet paradoxically the cost of a name brand medicine tends to go up year over year (till it hit the magic 20 year mark and generics can be released).  The health insurance industry has a LOT to do with this.  The article in this thread is proof of that - $84k for Hep C drug is $1500 outside the US... this is just greed.\n\nAnd the final thought.. yes the individual Pharama company is incentivised to offer \"treatments\" vs. \"cures\" as it is more profitable.. or sell their \"cure\" and price it at some X% of the lifetime cost of the \"treatment\".. but isn't this just a symptom of how broken the system is?\n\nWhile it's infinitely more profitable for that specific company, what is the cost to the economy as a whole?  Now we either have people who are perpetually sick and a large percentage of their income goes to a \"lifetime treatment\" or someone can pay a one time fee of multiple years income to get a \"cure\"... godforbid they have multiple ailments or other family member that get sick.

For every card transaction, there's a convenience fee that the processors charge, called an interchange fee. Every party in the chain from the card processor to the issuing bank or credit union gets a cut of that. I work at a tiny credit union, and those fees are a big deal.

In the US, virtually no credit cards have PINs. (I mean, some do, but for cash advances at an ATM, not for authorizing a transaction in store.) The articles have been a bit misguided with their reporting on that, IMO. \n\n>I had presumed there wasn't, and the reporting was talking about PIN vs Signature when they really mean debit network vs credit network.\n\nYou're correct. The lawsuit is about debit cards, which when authorized with a PIN take place on the debit network and when authorized with a signature take place on the credit network. Walmart and Home Depot want the ability to restrict debit cards to use on the debit network (that is, with a PIN) in order to keep their own costs lower. Visa says that they have to allow customers the choice to run their debit card \"as credit\" meaning, as you know, on the credit network. \n\nSome articles have misleadingly written that WM/Home Depot \"pay Visa 5 cents more\" for signature transactions as opposed to PIN transactions. They may pay more, but it's not the difference between paying Visa 10 cents for PIN debit and 15 cents for signature debit, or something. It's the difference between paying Visa nothing and paying Visa 15 cents for signature. (Numbers hypothetical.)\n\nVisa doesn't make money from Walmart when a Visa debit card is authorized with a PIN. (Run on the debit network.) They DO make money from Walmart when a Visa debit card is authorized with a signature. (Run on the credit network.) Effectively, Walmart is trying to prevent Visa from making money while still accepting Visa debit cards. A bit of a 'have their cake and eat it, too' situation. \n\nFor whatever other faults Visa has, I don't really side with Walmart on this one. Additionally, giving customers the choice between the two authentication methods is in Visa's contract with Walmart. (Which is also how Visa is countersuing, saying that Walmart willingly entered the contract with the intent to break it.) \n\nThe other thing is that a lot of businesses might see this situation and assume that signature debit is always more expensive, which actually isn't necessarily the case for smaller-ticket merchants.

Consultants work contract-based jobs for just a few weeks at a time. Our statements of work specify a \"best effort\" penetration test. Our deliverable is written document detailing exploits that we found and how to fix them. How do you interpret this?\n\nI personally interpret it the same way that _most_ security consultants at my company do. I start my day at a reasonable time (9 AM for me, but 10 or 11 AM for my colleagues), go at it pretty hard for a majority of the day, take 30\u201360 minutes for lunch, take several other small breaks throughout the course of the day for mental rejuvenation, and then leave my office about 8.5\u20139 hours after I got there. Working around 8 hours per day is socially acceptable, and it's about how much I can work before I feel my performance significantly diminish.\n\nSo, the client is paying my firm for our time, which includes delivering a report of findings at the conclusion of the engagement. There is a tangible object that represents results of our \"best effort,\" which is, itself, nebulous. They could buy more of our time for better results. Although there are diminishing returns, I never feel _fully_ satisfied by the end of a security assessment. There's always another function to dig into. Sometimes, it only takes one really obscure bug to take over a computer.\n\nMy time is something that our client bought. The report is another thing that they bought. One is just _time_, and one is _results_. Which one did they pay for? Whatever it was, it amounts to about 40 hours per week for me. I will stay late to make sure that a report is complete, but I won't stay too late to just continue hacking. Of course I could keep probing for more bugs; I could do it forever.\n\nIn my previous job, I was a typical software developer working on a brand new product that had an uncertain end state. I'm not sure how I would have quantified *results* there. Was it when I finished a function, or a whole feature? The product was not complete and never will be. I interpreted my responsibility as contributing about 40 hours of my time per week. I worked extra late if there was an emergency, but not during a typical work week.\n\nPeople are going to have a different distribution of results-based vs. time-based work to do than you and I have.

It should be put to empirical test.\nNew empirical research will be needed to pin down\nprecisely who knows how much, and what, about which\npublic policies.\n\nI hope you go back and look over your comments and realize that it reeks of a flawed \"I'm smart so if you disagree with me then you're an idiot\" viewpoint.

If you don't understand the impact of artificially high wages then you screaming for $15 minimum wage means nothing to me and I don't really want to hear it. How many of those people who are out there screaming to artificially raise wages across the US actually know the impact that would have throughout society? Probably not many. \n\nSimply put, the average person isn't capable of making decisions for themselves about how their life should be when it comes to incredibly complex policies that they will never fully understand. Kind of like how children aren't capable of making decisions for themselves about how their life should be when it comes to the complexity of living life. It's only with time and experience that they learn and are able to look back and see how stupid they were being. Unfortunately, the average citizen isn't interested in researching basic economics so they'll never be able to look back and realize how stupid they were being. \n\nTL;DR\n\nThe average citizen is like a child who is simply incapable of making many of the decisions that require significant knowledge on the specific topic.

If we let the average citizen decide US policies for themselves, they'd likely ruin this country. \n\nTo add to that and make a comment on the graph being used in that awful video, it's not being 'an elite' that raises your chances of your voice being heard in Washington (or even your city), it's simply knowing what the fuck you're talking about.

The ballot measure would hold platforms such as Airbnb and VRBO accountable for ensuring that hosts are registered with the city and adhering to a 75-day annual limit on short-term rentals. It also would require tenants to get a landlord\u2019s approval before advertising a short-term rental.\n\nIt would bring genuine rigor to a practice that is now almost impossible to enforce \u2014 and, as a result, the status quo encourages the lucrative short-term rental of rooms and homes that otherwise might be available for permanent housing in a city that has a severe scarcity of it.\n\nBut there is an overriding issue that compels a no vote: The very fact that it is on the ballot and could not be altered or even voided without another public vote. This is exactly the wrong way to try to impose regulation on a fast-evolving practice that, for all its side effects, has been a plus for both the tourism industry and some residents who need the income to make ends meet.\n\nBallot-box planning is a bad approach even for a measure that is perfect for the moment. This one is not. One of its enforcement mechanisms would allow neighbors or groups to sue the host of a short-term rental even if the city has determined that no violation has occurred. It opens the potential for mischief and frivolous lawsuits by antagonistic neighbors.\n\nIt also would remove the distinction between hosted short-term rentals \u2014 in which the resident is present during the stay \u2014 and unhosted ones. This is an area that merits further study; a reasonable case can be made that a vacationer is less likely to be disruptive to a neighborhood when the resident is present.\n\n", "id": "d9b39p9"}, {"comment": "> rural cities\n\no_O", "id": "d9awu1m"}], [{"comment": "Well, this is probably a good thing but my airbnb for NYC in November just cancelled and the hotels are THREE TIMES THE PRICE.

And of course negative profits => no taxes that year...because profits are the tax base...\n\n[[edit to clarify: profits for tax purposes are calculated [a little differently](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-access/f1120fm1_accessible.pdf) from profits for financial reporting purposes. In either case, though, we're talking about a \"net\" rather than \"gross\" income measure. Most of this time (there are exceptions) a company with a financial reporting loss is going to also have negative taxable net income, and vice versa]]\n \n\"Accelerated Depreciation\" is a major contributor as well -- if you look by industry, those that are most intensive in physical capital tend to pay the lowest effective rates. \n#Accelerated Depreciation ELI10:\n\n- **\"Depreciation\"** is how we allocate the cost of something that lasts a long time over its useful life. If we buy a machine that we expect to last ten years, we don't subtract the full purchase price from profit -- instead, we spread out the purchase price over the ten years we'll be using it and take that amount out of profit in each year as an expense. This keeps us from having profit that's \"too low\" in the year we buy the machine and \"too high\" in the years we use it but didn't buy it. It also prevents there from being *too* big a difference between buying vs leasing the machine, at least from a net income perspective, which is good because those options aren't that different economically. \n- **\"Straight-Line\" depreciation** is when we spread out the cost *evenly* over the useful life. If we paid $100k for it, we'll be using it for ten years, and it'll be worthless at the end of those ten years, we'll take $10k/yr out of income in all years as depreciation expense for it instead of $100k in the first year and nothing in all years after that. \n  - what this means for taxes: The cost of purchasing the machine shaves $4k/yr off our tax liability in each year instead of taking $40k off in the first year.\n- **\"Accelerated Depreciation\"** is any method of allocating cost across the useful life that results in more depreciation expense early in the useful life. So maybe instead of $10k in all years we do [$30k, $30k, $30k, $10k] in the first four years and then stop because it's fully depreciated. You can think of this as somewhere between straight-line depreciation and taking all the expense in the first year.\n  - what this means for taxes: Instead of saving $40k on taxes in the first year or $4k in each of ten years, the cost of the machine reduces your tax liability by $12k in the first three years, $4k in the fourth year, and nothing after that. \n\nYou'll notice that in all cases the total number of dollars in tax liability from the machine will be the same -- the tax rate times the cost of the machine. But when you use accelerated depreciation instead of straight-line, these tax savings come sooner. Because money now is better than money later, this is good for the company (and bad for the Treasury) in present value terms. This is a bigger savings if the company's scaling up, if the company's cost of capital (basically, interest rate the company has to pay on money) is high, if inflation is high, or if a lot of the company's costs are from things that can be depreciated.", "id": "d4c8rdi"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d4cat7u"}, {"comment": "Right but \"Taxable Income\" and book profits plus taxes (EBT) are usually pretty close.

Since Microsoft is a huge corporation with a solid balance sheet, and interest rates in the broader market are so low, Microsoft will have a low interest rate on any debt they take out.

As it turns out, since their cost of debt is so low it makes most sense to finance this entirely with debt rather than cash on hand. Part of this has to do with the taxes they would have to pay on repatriating overseas cash, but that is really a moot point because even if they could access all that cash tax-free they would still use debt because it is so cheap for them.

That's the biggest joke, here. The NBC chairman thinks people won't tune in because they are lost on Facebook or Snapchat (or Reddit, for that matter).

Access:  I don't have cable - only streaming services.  NBC wants me to log in with my cable provider to access it for free. Nope.

World view:  I'd rather just watch people playing sports than watch Americans playing sports.  It's cool for them to get recognized for a non main-stream sport that isn't normally on but the American-Centric coverage is a bit ridiculous.  The Olympics are on at my workplace in the break room, and I keep catching Women's Water Polo at lunch.  Of course, it's always the USA vs whoever.  I've never watched it, and I don't understand the strategy of Women's Water Polo, so I need more context through more games - not just seeing the US pound whoever and then move on to some other sport to see another American potentially winning.

No longer a singular pageant:  I'm surprised how long it took me to realize that the Olympics are just one stop on the normal world tours of a lot of sports. They aren't even the most important event to a whole lot of the sports. While it's a great prize on a world stage, one stop on the world tour means that it's less special.  And hell, if I miss the Olympics, I might just be able to still watch other Women's Water Polo games on youtube, or find out where they play around the country and go see if I'm really interested, which brings us back to...\n\n4. Corporatization and Monetization of the games:  It's less fun when there are a billion corporate sponsors over everything.  It's even less fun when they limit my access to make a buck or 10.  Or shove sponsorship in my face at every turn which is such an extreme turnoff.  The media keeps telling me how exciting and important it is, and yet most of these games are being played in half-empty stadium and US coverage is ignoring so much of the Olympics.  Snooze.  Where's the tension and excitement?  It's a happy celebration that we've come together for purpose of making lot of money.  Wait I thought it was about atletic display, which leads to....\n\n5. Corruption:  After all that is said and done leading up to these Olympics in Rio, we pretend like there is no corruption or that the corruption out there is from outlyers - and it just doesn't feel like it is anymore.  Olympic bidding, Contract letting, cleaning out parts of the city, and things like doping, fixing, and others are downplayed in official coverage.  Yes, we can talk about it on the internet, but official stuff says to remain happy and pretend it doesn't exit.

I am also sports crazy.  I don't care what the sport is - I'll watch it and really get into it.  But, here is why I'm not really paying attention:\n\n1.  Access:  I don't have cable - only streaming services.  NBC wants me to log in with my cable provider to access it for free. Nope.  I suppose that I could go to the store and purchase a set of digital bunny ears.  But why would I do that if I'm not super crazy about it, but why am I not crazy about it, could it be my....\n\n2.  World view:  I'd rather just watch people playing sports than watch Americans playing sports.  It's cool for them to get recognized for a non main-stream sport that isn't normally on but the American-Centric coverage is a bit ridiculous.  The Olympics are on at my workplace in the break room, and I keep catching Women's Water Polo at lunch.  Of course, it's always the USA vs whoever.  I've never watched it, and I don't understand the strategy of Women's Water Polo, so I need more context through more games - not just seeing the US pound whoever and then move on to some other sport to see another American potentially winning.  I'm not just a \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\" sort of person. Which leads to your point of...\n\n3.  No longer a singular pageant:  I'm surprised how long it took me to realize that the Olympics are just one stop on the normal world tours of a lot of sports. They aren't even the most important event to a whole lot of the sports. While it's a great prize on a world stage, one stop on the world tour means that it's less special.  And hell, if I miss the Olympics, I might just be able to still watch other Women's Water Polo games on youtube, or find out where they play around the country and go see if I'm really interested, which brings us back to...\n\n4. Corporatization and Monetization of the games:  It's less fun when there are a billion corporate sponsors over everything.  It's even less fun when they limit my access to make a buck or 10.  Or shove sponsorship in my face at every turn which is such an extreme turnoff.  The media keeps telling me how exciting and important it is, and yet most of these games are being played in half-empty stadium and US coverage is ignoring so much of the Olympics.  Snooze.  Where's the tension and excitement?  It's a happy celebration that we've come together for purpose of making lot of money.  Wait I thought it was about atletic display, which leads to....\n\n5. Corruption:  After all that is said and done leading up to these Olympics in Rio, we pretend like there is no corruption or that the corruption out there is from outlyers - and it just doesn't feel like it is anymore.  Olympic bidding, Contract letting, cleaning out parts of the city, and things like doping, fixing, and others are downplayed in official coverage.  Yes, we can talk about it on the internet, but official stuff says to remain happy and pretend it doesn't exit.

Clicking on the link, I got to a page which didn't show any video, but had another link to their App.  Okay, fine I said, I'll install the Android App.  After it started up, I was back to a home screen, so I had to search around again for live Taekwando.  Once I found it, I got a message about this being a \"30 minute trial\", and that I had to register my provider or something.\n\nThen I was shown a video advertisement for something.  After the advertisement was done, the video ended, and I received a message saying that the event was complete.  Nowhere had it ever been indicated to me that the event was complete or near complete.\n\nThinking I might want to try another event, and that I needed to register to prevent the 30 minute trial, I went into settings.  It asked me for my cable/dish provider.  **I don't have a cable/dish provider, NBC.  I watch your channel broadcast.**\n\nSo basically NBC's \"solution\" to their Olympic woes didn't work for me at all.  I tried to stream an Olympic event, and utterly failed.

", "id": "d3rbqjl"}, {"comment": "Actually it did, states that fully implemented the ACA have had a lower increase, and a few have had decreases in health care costs.  Those states that refused Medicaid expansion, have not done so well.", "id": "d3rcomw"}, {"comment": "Actually, this chart is incredibly misleading because it only lists the basic PPO definition, and fails to include other costs and plans.\n\n1. HMO, still popular and while they have higher premiums now they are lower usage cost. Limitations on doctors is virtually gone because everything except top name brand doctors are part of the networks.\n\n2. Preventative and high deductible plans - these are the most used plans now. They have lower premiums and higher family deductibles, but also have maximum out of pocket. Family deductible is typically about $3,000 (which is about the same as employee match for a family), and that usually has incentives that cover the first $1000 of deductible if you do their biometrics and preventative (covered 100%, no deductible). That leaves another $2,000 to cover the deductible, but if you only use the first $1000 of deductible you pay nothing else. After that max out of pocket is $6000, including what you put into deductible, meaning the most you would pay would be $3,000 for the employee pay and $6,000 out of pocket, $9,000 max for the whole family, and only if you used it all. Note with my plan the first $1,000 out of pocket is covered by my company so it is even less, but not everyone gets that so I excluded it.\n\n3. Pretax, insurance, and spending accounts (some which roll over year to year) are all available pretax, meaning if you are in say a 25% tax bracket you can cut your costs down by that, so the $9,000 max becomes $6,750 max, for the whole year, and that is if you exceed the $6,000 out of pocket max, which a tiny percentage of people do.\n\n4. Government subsidies - for low income, will reduce this further. Does not affect deductible or out of pocket but reduces the monthly (or bimonthly) cost, sometimes down to nothing.\n\n5. Obamacare - I actually compared my employee plan to the closest plan on the state's version of Obamacare and my employee plan was only slightly better. Their premiums were about the same for same deductible and out of pocket max, but my company gave us incentives to reduce deductible. Either way, I lose my jobe I can keep a similar plan going forward.\n\nThere is the caveat that dental is a separate plan, and now vision is being separated, these add up to about $600 for family but not everyone gets those.\n\nSo, all said a healthy family can be paying $3-4k per year for plans not really being used, and a worst case scenario should be able to pay south of $7,000 per year if they do their homework. Mind you, some clueless states make this difficult, but it is well below the numbers Forbes is pushing. \n\nAnyway, just a perspective for you guys.

Health insurance is more important than both of those, it is now mandatory and subsidized, so yeah, its a really good idea. \n\nThat and you get taxed $2,000 not to get it, and I think that's per person not household, so just getting it to avoid the tax makes sense if you never use it.

In forced rankings, the manager of A and the manager of B have to classify a certain amount of their staff as \"the best\" and a certain amount as relative underperformers.

Criminal law is just totally outside of the scope of this stuff. If airbnb is found criminally negligent then it is going to wind up in court no matter what - but this doesn't matter for you as a private citizen.

It may vary slightly from state to state and on the type of damage alleged, but yes, this is the whole point, and criminally responsible parties can still be found not to have civil liability specifically for these reasons. Again, that is going to vary a lot - but the odds of any of this stuff rising to the level of criminality is very low anyway. \n* In general, yes, the only recourse is individually through binding arbitration. Whether or not this means Airbnb users can sue each other is something I haven't really thoughtabout - its a definite \"maybe / I don't know.\"\n* As above, there are exceptions, but there is a truckload of caselaw upholding this in all sorts of circumstances where even I, as a soulless suit, have thought \"damn, that's harsh.\" For instance, binding arbitration and waiver of class action has been upheld against walmart in systematic workers sexual discrimination lawsuits - which is just... sanity-blasting to me. Additionally, binding arbitration has been upheld as a matter of routine in *clickwrap* contracts which is also very worrisome to me - and it has been upheld in all manner of gruesome cases of personal injury, enormous financial losses and property damage.\n* Yes, it **is** a heavy click - but don't worry, dotcomrade!

Finding people who are certifiably reliable/responsible to entrust with liability of the vehicle is not.\n\nFirst, drivers arent paid as well as many people think they are.  While CDL drivers are often paid a respectable yearly income, people don't realize they work 70 hours a week to achieve this.

While this may sound trivial to your typically Redditor, I assure you, in practice its very difficult to find candidates who meet all of the above mentioned criteria for the wages offered.\n\nDoing the job itself - operating the vehicle - is practically unimportant in comparison to being a qualified candidate - thats where the actual worth/value of the driver comes from.  \n\nOnce you consider that someone is going to *still have to meet these requirements, including the licensing* just to monitor an automated vehicle - you will quickly realize that there is no money to be saved via wages.  You will still have to pay the same amount of money for that employee, and that employee will still have to be attentive the entire time. Dreams of doing other things while the truck drives itself are a fantasy - if the truck can drive itself without your supervision, then you arent needed at all, which isnt going to be the case for quite some time and unravels the entire argument you posted.\n\nSo now you're still paying a similar wage for a similarly qualified employee, but in addition to the added costs of all the self driving equipment - it just doesnt make sense financially to do this over paying a driver.\n\nYes, automated driving will happen eventually, but not in the way everyone on reddit likes to think, and certainly not in your optimistic timelines.", "id": "d6nk9z7"}, {"comment": "Cool story today on this topic.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-25/uber-self-driving-truck-packed-with-budweiser-makes-first-delivery-in-colorado", "id": "d97vznh"}, {"comment": "That's maybe the longest reply I've seen to anything I've ever commented.

Both more likely to spend, and more likely to spend more. I'm curious if you have any facts to back up your statement", "id": "d69s7ft"}, {"comment": "Fair questions to ask. It late july it was announced that [Google Play installs for Pokemon Go reached 50 million, and \"if you add iOS users, the app has an combined total install base of 75 million\"](http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/pokemon-go-75-million-installs-on-ios-android-2936666/). Using those numbers, Android users of the app outnumber iOS users by a 2:1 ratio.\n\nI have no data for the in app sales, but I don't doubt that iOS users are more likely to per-capita spend more money in the app, as historically that's been the rule rather than the exception when comparing iOS users to Android users. \n\nSo theoretically, yes, Apple may be making more money than Google on this, since Google has 2x the users but Apple may still have has 2.5x the per-capita sales. \n\nHowever, that being said, I do feel like Pokemon Go isn't your typical game, and I think per-capita in app sales will be *slightly* more equivalent between the two OS platforms. I'm sure iOS still leads per-capita, but I really doubt Pokemon Go has the 2.5:1 ratio seen in Apple's average. I'm leaving the realm of hard data and moving into speculation here, but I think the logic holds: \n\n* Many iOS games are marketed towards wealthier suburban families that are more likely to have kids/moms with expendable income to spend on games. Games like Candy Crush are great examples, this game has raked in tens of millions and it caters to moms and casual adult gamers who are more than willing to spend money in the app. This segment of the population, the one willing to spend in game money of casual games, is the same segment of the population more likely to buy an iPhone due to the greater ease of use and the higher price tag being affordable to upper middle class homes. \n\n* Conversely, Android's core audience tends to be younger teens and college kids, who are drawn towards Android phones due to lower cost and more customizability in the UI, something the millennials are eager to play with while older generations are less tech savvy and instead prefer Apple's polished intuitive UI.\n\nThe difference in target populations of the devices (young kids and broke college students, vs established adults and casual gamers) is what we can speculate has lead to the in app sales differences between iOS and Android. With that axiom established, we can look at Pokemon Go and see how it may buck this typical trend. The game is extremely popular across all segments of the population, and despite how much income you have or don't have, the game is played in a very identical way across the board. All players have to leave their homes to play the game, all players have to visit locations in the community, etc. **This isn't a game where suburban house wives with iPhones are playing it with their wallet, and broke college students and 12 year olds without credit cards are forced to play it another, cheaper way using their Android phones**.  This is a game that spans the generational and wealth gap, and is played in virtually the same way by all users. Sure you can spend money in game for small perks, but it's not to the same degree as the way money changes games like Candy Crush.\n\n**TL;DR:** We have no idea what the in-app sale numbers are. iOS is almost certainly still leading in the in-app sales per device, but Android has a press reported 2:1 lead in number of devices with the game installed. Personally I don't think Pokemon Go is a game where iOS users are outspending Android users by more than 2:1, since it's just not that type of \"freemium\" game that typically thrives in the iOS market. Therefore, given Androids 2:1 lead in total players, I think Google has made more than Apple on this particular game.

That includes Medicare for which they don't pay the government a rebate, but those are the numbers we have.\n\nSo assume every year up to 2011 their Medicare/Medicaid sales were $86.5 million and every year after that their sales were $486.8 million.  That is probably a *huge* overestimate, but it comes to $2.87 billion (2007-2016).  They shorted their rebates by $289 million at most and are paying $465 million.

The same mutual funds most people have in their 401k and what not.  Who goes to jail? All of America?  \n\nThe board is not there to set drug pricing either, they're there to ensure management does a good job for the shareholders.  In this case management obviously did a poor job but that doesn't make the board criminally responsible.  Furthermore civil penalties are far easier to accomplish than criminal ones.  If the DOJ actually attempted to bring criminal charges against anyone, Idk what even for, they'd surely fail.  You really can't be held criminally liable for charging too much for a product you make.  Frankly the civil fine probably doesn't  have a ton of precedent to stand on.  Sure what the company did was morally bankrupt but that doesn't necessarily translate to illegal much less criminally illegal.  And it certainly doesn't translate to sending people to jail who had zero input in the pricing. \n\n Beyond that the previous poster really showed their ignorance because as you can see in the above link the vast majority of the company is owned by mutual funds and thus by extension the American public.  People shit the bed when this sort of thing happens but don't bother to look at where those extra few basis points in their IRA/401k came from.  \n\nE: for example the second largest individual shareholder is the vanguard total stock market fund.  Now vanguard is the largest provider of 401ks in the country and their total stock is the largest component of their target date funds which are the default options in any 401k.

But look at his own story. He bought 86-DOS without a government grant. He licensed it back to pc builders as MS-DOS without the government manipulating the market. He did this to make a profit. He created thousands of jobs, and kicked off an industry that created millions of jobs. Once they got big they got in trouble for abusing their monopoly, and they should be punished for that, but he went from a nerd with $50,00 he earned by being smart and hard-working (he used to read every single line of MS code himself, often working 16 hour days), without stealing from anyone else or buying off politicians.\n\nI don't have a twitter account, nor do I want one, but his non-profit does a lot of great work. From donations. Made by Bill. From his for-profit company. That he built from nothing by being super smart and working hard. They abused their monopoly after they got huge, but they got to be a giant without the government manipulating the market to help them along. In fact, MS gave Apple a bunch of money to keep them alive in the 90s because they didn't want a complete monopoly and all the shit that comes along with it. But the government didn't force that either.\n\nI'm not saying corporations are the greatest thing in the world, but they are generally predictable, and easy to keep in check, but only if our government wanted to do that instead of helping them control the market then pretending to be angry about it afterward.\n\n", "id": "d8kvj2e"}, {"comment": "The reason I mentioned Bill Gates' tweet is exactly for his background that you mention.

That should speak for itself. \n\nQuoting examples of failed government innovation is not relevant IMO. Any investment can fail. That's not the point. The point is that the US government has deeper pockets than any company (even Apple) and can choose to invest in schemes such as basic research which don't even have set outcomes. \n\nBut back to my earlier point about free markets, you mentioned MS being a monopoly. Free markets do have a tendency to become dominated by a monopoly (e.g. Amazon, MS), or a small set of massive conglomerates. When there's true competition, markets tend to perform well. When there's a small set of incumbents, and the product choice is very limited or essentially there's only one choice (as with some utility providers), the market is no longer really functioning as a competitive market. The monopolies can start to set their own prices, as with the drug mentioned earlier. IMO it's government's role to prevent monopolies, and to stimulate competition. 'Free market' is an ideology.

Labor, packaging up and transporting goods is a big part of the cost.\n\n--\n\nI know it's small potatoes (lol no pun intended), but I have several fruit trees, and in the fall end up with far more apples and pears than I can stomach (or even store, bother to can, etc).\n\nNow people are MORE than willing to accept \"free fruit\" -- provided **you** pick it for them, **you** pack it for them, and **you** deliver it to them -- IOW the \"free\" has to be on a proverbial silver platter.\n\nWell I said \"nuts to that\" -- now I pick what I need/want, and leave the rest to just drop on it's own -- it really doesn't go to waste, after all the various animals (birds, deer, etc) end up eating it, some years, evening digging through the snow in the winter to get at what is left/buried & half rotten or even partially \"fermented\" (watching semi-\"drunk\" deer staggering off in the snow is a hoot).\n\n--\n\n**I'd predict that something similar will eventually play out here.** Probably the main (only) thing this is really going to end up doing,  is shift WHERE in the process the excess food ends up being thrown out.\n\nTo begin with, the charities/food banks won't have the funds to hire personnel, or pay for storage capacity (especially refrigeration) to keep, much less do they really have a system that can scale up in terms of properly rotating through or distribute some major increase; meaning that THEY will end up tossing a lot (more) of what heads their way (and they already throw out a lot).\n\nThen, very likely stores will also work at becoming a LOT more circumspect in what (and how much) they carry; if they're going to be burdened with substantial additional costs to get rid of excess, well then the best approach is going to NOT have \"excess\" at all, and to that end to take pains to reduce/minimize the excess, and to optimize the inventory rotations (much more than they have been); meaning they'll probably lower the quantities of what they carry and probably boost the price... less selection, higher chance of \"sorry we have no bananas today\" scenarios for shoppers, and due to that indeterminate availability, customers will buy more when its present, store & eventually throw more of it away at home.\n\nThat'll then backfire on the charities and food banks, because they'll no longer be receiving what they had anticipated/ramped up to get (and in fact might even end up receiving LESS than they had prior to the passage of the law).\n\nMore than likely the impact will also have a ripple effect and pass back UP the supply chain; as the retail stores become less willing to carry any possible excess (no thanks we only sell 550 lbs of potatoes in a week, there is no point in us taking 600 lbs, not even if the 600 lbs is offered at the *same* price as the 550 lbs). That means the distributors are going to (at least potentially) be sitting on more... and then THEY will need to toss it into the trash, which is a loss to them, so they too will attempt to reduce excess and have tighter inventory management. Which means it then ripples back further up the supply chain, eventually to the processors and farmers who will cut back on what they harvest/push through their systems as well... Bumper crop year? Well if you can't sell it, because no one wants the \"burden\" & additional costs of dealing with the excess (including the risk of being fined) ... then much like the \"excess\" fruit from my trees -- it will simply be left to rot in the fields.\n\n**In the end, no one will really benefit.**", "id": "czpsdil"}, {"comment": "There's a lot of supposition here.

My point to you was that while you have pointed out that this system may end in the same result, it may also drive a positive economic and environmental effect. \n\nAh but what you seem to not comprehend, is how mass production operates.  Yes, even -- or indeed especially -- with agriculture.\n\nProduction is **always** going to be somewhat variable, subject to the vagaries in amounts and timing of everything from rainfall, to temperature, humidity, etc.  We have made tremendous progress in the past century of \"optimizing\" production, but other than for certain \"boutique\" produce (hydroponic alfalfa sprouts, etc) -- it is still far short of some \"perfect machine\" where the inputs and outputs can be predicted with 100% certainty.\n\nErgo if any society is going to try to \"plan\" it's food production to make certain there is *at least* sufficient adequate minimal production -- i.e. you don't want millions to go hungry and NOT have enough to eat -- then you have to plan (and plant) for what will probably be a \"very bad case\" scenario: a year when yields will be perhaps only 70% of \"average\" or \"normal\".\n\nBut in doing so, you have to plant so that you will also very likely have \"normal\" production; and possibly a \"bumper crop\" year that yields significantly higher output.\n\nNow the thing is, crops tend to mature \"all at once\", and to be harvested in bulk, and by machinery that requires essentially the SAME amount of capital, and fuel, hours to operate, and ground that must be covered -- to harvest a given field -- and that is regardless of whether the yield is at 70%, 100%, or some \"bumper\" crop of 120%.\n\nTo wit:\n\n>>The 2014 projected national average corn yield would be well above recent U.S. corn yields of **158.8 bushels per acre** in 2013, **123.4 bushels per acre** in 2012, and **147.2 bushels per acre** in 2011. The previous record U.S. average corn yield was **164.7 bushels per acre** in 2009. **[Source](http://cornandsoybeandigest.com/blog/usda-projects-record-2014-crop-production)**\n\nNote the variation there: from a low of 123.4 bushels, to a high of 164.7 bushels -- if you posit an \"average\" multi-year yield of 150 bushels per acre, then you've got a variation of -20% to +10% across those sample years. And keep in mind that NONE of those years (not even 2009) was actually a truly \"bumper crop\" harvest, nor was the low yield year (2012) some absolutely catastrophic \"drought\" or \"flood\" either -- they were all within the \"middle\" of a standard deviation around a norm.\n\n*EDIT: Also note that the numbers above are the* ***national*** *aggregate average \"per acre\" yields--  the yield for any given specific acre can vary anywhere from ~100 to (consistently) 300+ bushels per acre, and (in some instances) [to well over 500 bushels per acre.](http://southeastfarmpress.com/grains/david-hula-makes-record-532-bushels-acre-top-ncga-yield-contest)*\n\nAnd that of course is CORN (Maize), a crop that is readily stored in a variety of forms, and across multiple years for delayed processing: useful for animal fodder as well as human food, and other (biofuel) applications as well -- the point being that the shortages or excesses do not have anything like some \"immediate\" effect on supermarket supply chain.\n\nOther foods, especially the so called \"fresh\" foods and \"raw\" foods -- most of which are not so easy to preserve or store, and which have very short shelf life (in any form other than \"canned\", even refrigerated), and all too quickly \"rot\" -- are far MORE variable in all aspects of production quantities.\n\nThe cost of and the resources expended in harvesting, say a field of tomatoes, or lettuce, or carrots -- will be essentially the same -- whether the yield was at 50%, or 100%, or 150% percent of the expected (planned) result.\n\nWhat would you have the farmers do? STOP the machine 2/3 of the way across the field, and say *\"OK boys, we've gotten the 100% of the planned harvest from this field, lets raise the harvesting head and just idle across the rest of the field, the remaining crop isn't needed...\"*\n\nYou can do that with TREES, the ones you leave standing, well you can come back and log them next year; the same with deep sea fishing, and to an extent with cattle and other animal herds. \n\nBut the tomatoes (or carrots, or lettuce, or squash, or arugula, oranges, apples, bananas coffee, etc etc etc) -- well it doesn't work like that. If you **don't** finish harvesting the rest of that crop in fairly short order (something that involves a trivial amount of additional resources or costs) ... then you CAN'T come back and harvest it again later... in most cases even a week or two later, and it will have already begin to either rot, or to have reached a stage where harvesting is far LESS than ideal, and where most of it will be unable to survive processing, much less make it to market.\n\n**See, this is what I mean by far too many (especially young, supposedly \"educated\") people being \"IGNORANT\".** The word isn't \"condescending\" it is **accurate** and **appropriate**, because they **are** lacking in actual *practical knowledge* or *experience* of any of that.\n\nIt's incredibly easy for people who ARE ignorant of food production to bemoan the \"waste\" and to assert -- as you have here using that ambiguous/arbitrary even imperialistic \"we\" of the delusional *demos* like some Goldilocks-child -- should \"plan\" things more perfectly... that the proverbial porridge should ever and always be at the \"just right\" temperature, neither too hot, nor too cold, but always \"just right\"; that food should NEVER EVER be something that is \"scarce\", but also NEVER produced in excess, but ever and always just the \"exact\" right amount.\n\nThat is demonstrative of a CHILDISH ignorance -- understandable in an actual \"child\" (a 3 or 5 year old), especially a spoiled/entitled brat who has been coddles and had their every whiny demand \"satisfied\" -- but it's the kind of ignorance that is actually beyond SAD when it comes to an adult.\n\n--\n\nAnd so I really don't give a shit if you're \"skin\" is so thing and you are so easily triggered or offended by snark or hyperbole, much less by point out YOUR ignorance.\n\nBecause quite frankly... you need to grow up.  If you are asking a question (especially when you have previously some ridiculously STUPID \"condescending\" assertion) that regards something you should have LONG AGO learned the reality of -- well, you deserve a bit of upbraiding.\n\n*Alas, rather than LEARNING... you will far more likely be \"offended\" and run away crying, seeking reassurance & validation from your similarly ignorant and spoiled, entitled peers, so that you can remain attached to your little pet \"assertion\".*\n\n--\n\nYou see \"bud\", this ISN'T a conversation between equally knowledgeable peers; your opinion is NOT equally valid.

They don't. The DNS is secured by DNSSEC. Every quarter, the Crypto Officers enable the hardware security module that is used to store the private key of the root zone's Key Signing Key (KSK). The private portion of the KSK is used to sign the Zone Signing Keys (ZSKs) created by Verisign, which in turn are used by Verisign to sign the root zone. The public portion of the KSK is the root trust anchor that is configured into DNS resolvers that have DNSSEC validation turned on.\n\n> ICANN is responsible for assigning numerical internet addresses to websites and computers.\n\nUgh. No. ICANN is responsible for accepting change requests to top-level domains and facilitating the community in coming up with policies related to top-level domain management (e.g., how to create new top-level domains).  ICANN also allocates blocks of addresses to the Regional Internet Registries (APNIC, AfriNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, and RIPE-NCC), and manages protocol parameter registries on behalf of the IETF.\n\nThe RIRs assign blocks of addresses to ISPs and ISPs give blocks of addresses to their customers.

It is the KSK being changed, not the ZSK (the ZSKs change every quarter). This is indeed special in that a new KSK is being generated for the first time, but it won't be put in use until it can be copied to the West Coast Key Management Facility next quarter and certified.

", "id": "d937xvl"}, {"comment": "> The ceremony is a marketing gimmick.\n\nNot really.  The point of the ceremony is to bootstrap trust.  See the [Trusted Community Representative Proposal](http://www.root-dnssec.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ICANN-TCR-Proposal-20100408.pdf).  The idea is to do everything possible in an open and transparent fashion with folks who are trusted to instill trust in the underlying system.  Contrast this with out X.509 Root CAs establish trust (i.e., why do you trust (say) the Hong Kong Post Office)?\n\n> If that \"master key\" were compromised almost none of the Internet would be affected.\n\nAbout 15% of the Internet validates DNSSEC data. If the KSK were compromised, the folks who run the resolvers that are used by that 15% would need to decide to (a) turn off DNSSEC, (b) update their trust anchor, or (c) watch all DNS lookups fail with SERVFAIL.  Whether that is \"almost none\" is an interesting question.\n\n> This is a puff piece toned with yesterday's attacks.\n\nWell, I'd agree it's a bit weird to talk about given the Dyn attacks have nothing to do with DNSSEC...", "id": "d93qnmf"}], [{"comment": "That article has a few bits that are, well, wrong.\n\n> DNS at its highest levels is secured by a handful of people around the world, known crypto officers.\n\nNo. That makes it sounds like the Crypto Officers have an active role in securing the DNS. They don't. The DNS is secured by DNSSEC. Every quarter, the Crypto Officers enable the hardware security module that is used to store the private key of the root zone's Key Signing Key (KSK). The private portion of the KSK is used to sign the Zone Signing Keys (ZSKs) created by Verisign, which in turn are used by Verisign to sign the root zone. The public portion of the KSK is the root trust anchor that is configured into DNS resolvers that have DNSSEC validation turned on.\n\n> ICANN is responsible for assigning numerical internet addresses to websites and computers.\n\nUgh. No. ICANN is responsible for accepting change requests to top-level domains and facilitating the community in coming up with policies related to top-level domain management (e.g., how to create new top-level domains).  ICANN also allocates blocks of addresses to the Regional Internet Registries (APNIC, AfriNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, and RIPE-NCC), and manages protocol parameter registries on behalf of the IETF.\n\nThe RIRs assign blocks of addresses to ISPs and ISPs give blocks of addresses to their customers.  It is the customers that assign Internet addresses to websites and computers.\n\n> If someone were to gain control of ICANN's database, that person would pretty much control the internet.\n\nNo. Presumably the \"database\" here is the root zone.  ICANN does not maintain the root zone, that is Verisign's job as the Root Zone Maintainer.  However, if someone were to gain control of Verisign's database, they'd be able to make changes to top-level domains. This would be bad, but it would be detected and remedied quite quickly and does not grant \"control of the internet.\"\n\n> It selected seven people as key holders and gave each one an actual key to the internet.\n\nNo. As mentioned, the key holders hold the keys that are used to enable the HSMs that store the root zone's KSK, nothing more.\n\n> [The KSK] is a password of sorts that can access the master ICANN database\n\nThe KSK protects only the ZSKs. It is the ZSKs that are used to sign the root zone. And this isn't about access, it's about detecting if someone has modified DNS data returned by the root servers from the time the root zone was signed by Verisign to the time it is fetched by a resolver.\n\n> Technically speaking, [ICANN] will change the \"key pair\" upon which all DNS security is built, known as the Root Zone Signing Key\n\nClose. It is the KSK being changed, not the ZSK (the ZSKs change every quarter). This is indeed special in that a new KSK is being generated for the first time, but it won't be put in use until it can be copied to the West Coast Key Management Facility next quarter and certified.  After that (that is, 6 months from now), the new KSK will be used to sign Verisign's ZSKs.\n\n\n\n", "id": "d93e8rv"}], [{"comment": "This is one of those articles that is marketed to people that don't understand it and then the takeaway they get is generally something completely different than what the reality is.\n\nThis has nothing to do with \"control of the internet\".

You bought some cool collectible spider man glasses on a whim and set out that morning. Wham! A kind real estate developer driving by thought you were so cute that he bought all the sand you could put in cups for 18 solid months. He was going to use the sand as footings for buildings and wanted to give you a shot.

A great example of this is how Southwest Airlines bought a whole lot of oil futures in the 90s and 00s before they were high. This allowed them to pay less for fuel than other airlines. You can see how that's an investment related to what southwest does- they use the fuel that they bought as a hedge. You can also see that yahoo and zynga's decisions regarding startups and real estate were also excellent but they aren't principally a vc firm or real estate investors. There's nothing morally wrong here by the way, maybe it's legitimate that they start doing those businesses instead. But in that case they should have a different setup- most notably way fewer employees.\n\nWhat normally happens in companies like this is the shareholders force the board/ceo to sell off the assets and distribute.
