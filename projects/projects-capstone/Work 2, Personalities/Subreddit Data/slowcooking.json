This weekend I had a particular craving for a [New Saigon Sandwich]( http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-saigon-sandwich-boston)-style b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwich (the chicken teriyaki is my favorite).\n\nThis recipe is great because you can pre-chop and pickle the toppings and toss the rest into the slow cooker for later. We used this [Kitchen Confidante recipe]( http://kitchenconfidante.com/banh-mi-vietnamese-style-sandwich-recipe) in our slow cooker and it was delicious, but made a few changes:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n**For the pulled pork:**\n\n* 2-pound boneless pork shoulder roast (we couldn't find shoulder, and pork loin roast was on sale, so we snagged it) \n* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper\n* 1 jalapeno, diced (Adjust for heat tolerance. I'd recommend removing the seeds from the jalapenos that are put into the slow cooker; you can leave the seeds for more heat)\n* 1 2-inch piece of ginger, sliced thin\n* 8 cloves garlic, minced\n* 3/4 cup soy sauce (this turned out to be a salt bomb. I would recommend replacing some with beef or chicken stock to cut down on the salt).\n* 1/4 cup white vinegar\n* 1/2 cup brown sugar\n\n**For the pickled carrot:**\n\n* 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n* 1 1/2 cups coarsely shredded carrots\n\n**For the picked onion:**\n\n* 1/2 cup distilled white vinegar\n* 1/2 cup granulated sugar\n* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n* 1 medium white or yellow onion sliced really thin\n\n**For the sandwiches:**\n\n* pickled carrots (above)\n* picked onions (above)\n* 2 long baguettes cut in thirds or 4-6 small rolls, split lengthwise\n* mayonnaise (we made Sriracha Mayo at about 1/3 Sriracha to 2/3 Mayo)\n* 1 English cucumber, thinly sliced\n* 1 jalapeno, thinly sliced\n* 1 cup cilantro leaves\n* reserved sauce from pulled pork\n* hot sauce\n\n**Directions:**\n\nSeason the pork shoulder with salt and pepper. In the insert of a slow cooker, stir together the jalapeno, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, and brown sugar. Nestle the pork shoulder in the liquid. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4-5 (ours cooked really fast and was done, on high, at a little under 4 hours), until the pork is very tender, rotating once during cooking process if desired. When the pork is ready, shred the meat. Strain and reserve the sauce, skimming any fat if necessary. We ended up actually returning the shredded pork to the crockpot (on warm) with the strained sauce and it worked to keep the meat moist for longer. I wouldn't leave it too long like this though as it would eventually dry out.\n\nMake the pickled carrot and onion: In a medium glass bowl, combine the vinegar, sugar and salt and stir until dissolved. Add the carrots and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Drain well and refrigerate until ready to use. (follow the same for white/yellow onion).\n\nTo assemble the sandwich, slice the baguettes or rolls in half lengthwise. You can also toast them briefly for a better crunch (depending on your baguette). For more room, use your fingers to hollow out the baguette some (save the bread for croutons or something). Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise (we spiked ours with Sriracha) on the bottom half (both if you're a condiment fan). Top with the pulled pork, cucumber, cilantro, pickled carrots and onions, and sliced jalapenos. Drizzle with reserved sauce and hot sauce. Close the sandwiches and enjoy.\n\nEdit: Bullets for readability."], [11, "Followed your recipe, but managed to get the shoulder.

The artifical sugar will burn in the crock pot and ruin the meat.  You can also use beer or ale, if you prefer.  You're in it for the sugar and moisture.  Most of the flavor will cook off anyways.  I've even used Surge before because I thought it was funny.  Turned out great.\n\n* Slice the onion and line the bottom of the crock pot with it.  \n* Pour in a little bit of the soda, just enough to submerge the onions.\n* Rub your seasonings all over your meat.  I usually just pour on top with my left hand and pat down with my right.\n* Place meat in slow cooker, on bed of onions\n* Pour in remaining liquid (meat should NOT be submerged)\n* Cook on LOW for approx 8 Hours\n* Once done, remove meat from slow cooker and place in lightly-oiled pan (see above photos)\n* Using two forks, pull apart the meat, removing any excess fat or gristle as you go\n* Spread evenly until flat in pan\n* Add 1 cup of the juice from the slow cooker (for moisture)\n* Pour in your BBQ sauce and stir the meat until it's all mixed in\n* Broil for approx 20 minutes on the top rack (the top of the meat should get a little bit crispy)\n* If desired, remove meat from oven, stir, add more BBQ sauce, then broil for another 10 minutes or so\n* Scoop that meat onto a Potato Roll and scarf it down you animals"], [18, "Thanks for clickbaiting"], [13, "Am I the only one who makes pork with beer or cider instead of soda like a heathen?\n\nOn a related note, I made pulled pork with a pressure cooker last night.

It's midnight, about 7 degrees outside, and I'm flying down the highway without a window and all I want to do is get there but I'm still about an hour away. \n\nEdit : to clarify it was a mini Cooper hatchback. The back seats were down and my big dog was laying across them, so he was \"in the trunk\" so to speak. He could easily jump out the open back windshield if he wanted to, but thankfully he was scared and cowering as close to the front as he could get. \n\nWhen we finally arrive I park my windowless car on the street(in a pretty high crime area). I was planning to run the dog inside and come back out to figure out how to secure my car and belongings. Take my dog up to my building and the front door key doesn't work. Press a bunch of my neighbors buzzers but everyone's asleep (or ignoring me). Call my apt manager and wake him up, then wait on the steps for him for a half hour. Got nervous about a few expensive things in my car so I go grab one of the boxes and go sit back down on the apartment steps. My dog is totally freaked out (he's a country dog and this apartment is in an area known for its nightlife... Think drunk people everywhere and an overload of foreign sights and sounds for him). So I'm hugging my box of valuables, shivering like crazy, it starts to snow and I have to go back to my car to get a box of papers so it doesn't get wet (and I had to carry the other box of valuables with me, rather than leave it on the steps) so as I'm walking up the street with a 125 lb freaked out dog in one hand and balancing a stack of heavy boxes in my other, I'm wondering if this is a sign from god that moving was a bad idea. \n\nEventually we get into the apartment and all I want to do is go to sleep but no, I have to go empty out my car and tape garbage bags over the window hole bc it was basically a blizzard at that point. I don't think I got to bed until 4am.\n\nUgh it was the most terrible night ever. Thankfully after that everything went smoothly and moving was the best choice I every made so it was all worth it!

If you ever need a new glass lid and/or the metal part that actually does the cooking, let me know.

I use dried beans, yellow eyes if you can get them, soak them in cold water overnight and them cook them gently in the soaking water until they are tender (soft), but not mushy. Crock Pot recommends fully cooking the beans before you add the molasses and brown sugar because the sugar (and acidic foods) \"have a hardening effect on beans and will prevent softening.\" This is a good web site for avoiding bean cooking mistakes: http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/common-mistakes/article/how-to-cook-dried-beans\n\n2 cups (1 lb) beans, navy, red kidney, yellow eyes, Great Northern beans, etc.\nAbout 1 tsp salt, kosher or pickling salt recommended (I don't add salt at all. Read the web site to see what they say about salt.)\n1/4 lb salt pork (or you could use smoked ham hocks)\n2 t dry mustard\n5 T dark brown sugar\n4 T molasses (I use Brer Rabbit blackstrap)\n1 small onion, peeled and stuck w 2 whole cloves (this is not in Fannie's recipe, but this is what I do)\n\nWash the beans and soak overnight in plenty of water (6 cups or so). (There is a short method if you forget to soak overnight where you bring the beans and water to a boil, boil 2 minutes, remove from the heat, cover pot and let stand for 1 hour.) Add the salt, stir and drain, reserving the liquid. Cut off a third of the salt pork and place on the bottom of the  pot and add the beans to the pot. Blend the mustard, brown sugar, and molasses w the reserved bean liquid and pour over beans. Cut several gashes in the remaining salt pork and place on top of beans. Cover and cook about 6 hours (on low in crock pot), add water as needed. Uncover for the final hour of cooking so the pork becomes brown and crisp. (I never do this. If you do, be sure to keep enough water in the pot - the web site tells you why.)

Great as leftovers, as well. Served with fresh cilantro, tortilla chips, and sour cream.\n\nTeriyaki chicken breasts \u2013 Pretty decent, not outstanding. Cooked too long (my fault) but I shredded the chicken, strained the juice, and made a roux and thickened it. Served it over rice. \n\nMeatloaf  - tasted great, but cooking a meatloaf in the crockpot doesn\u2019t cut it, in my opinion, compared to the oven. I miss the crust that you get on top.\n\nCranberry Orange Chicken \u2013 good, but very sweet. My husband ended up making a gravy with the juices, and added some grainy mustard.

One is a toaster, because those things catch fire more than you would be willing to believe (right after misuse, faulty wiring was one of the most common causes of catastrophic failure resulting in fire). The other was traditional oven ranges, mostly from fires starting inside the oven itself (not the stove top, like is commonly shown in TV shows). I never got a close look at those, as I was always on the phone, but I would never EVER leave my oven on unattended. \n\nSlow cookers, on the other hand, are self-contained, small, and are not under high pressure, so I'm not nearly as afraid to leave it on and go to work.

", "id": "d996f4x"}, {"comment": "That article is terrible. It specifically doesn't mention the conditions that led to the blast, nor does it mention how old the pressure cooker was. Modern pressure cookers can't explode unless you specifically temper with the safety features. One of the more common problems with older pressure cookers was the pressure relief valve on top clogging up, which would then allow the pot to explode as the pressure built. Newer stovetop models have seals that are engineers to release well before the pressure builds enough to crack the pot itself, which are also engineered to insane levels. Pressure cookers work at around 15PSI, and most modern pots are rated to 60PSI or above, which means that under normal operation you have another 45+ PSI of headroom before the pot could explode, and then before it gets close to that point, the seals around the lid will release, and drop the pressure.\n\nOn top of that, electric pressure cookers have automated heating cutoffs that stop the pot from heating once they reach pressure, and continuously cycle the heating element while the food is cooking. This conserves electricity as well as serves as yet another redundant safety feature, as the electric models all have the same safety features as the stovetop models (pressure relief valve, safety seals, etc).", "id": "d999pw8"}]]], "3xplmb": ["My first Whole Chicken in a crock pot.

However, newer analization has suggested that an initial sear does nothing other that making hte exterior of the meat more prone to drying out.  Basically, searing ahead of time did not keep more juices in the meat than non searing.  But it did make a significant portion of the outside part of the mear tougher.\n\nA very popular way of doing roasts now, is the \"reverse sear\".  In a nutshell, the roast is put in the over (or slow cooker or smoker or grill, etc) at a very low temp and cooked for a long time.  When it reaches the desired internal temperature, it is removed and rested.  It can rest for however long, but probably not more than an hour.  Anyways, before it is served, the oven is preheated very high (around 500 degrees F), the roast placed in for maybe 5-10 min to achieve the exterior sear effect.  Since the searing is done at the end of the cooking time, the meat doesn't get dried out and still has that nice, charred taste.\n\n[Food lab has a good take on a prime rib, reverse sear style](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/12/food-lab-guide-to-prime-rib.html)", "id": "d57u6hy"}, {"comment": "Awesome, thanks!

Allow a can of full fat coconut milk to settle (about 1/2 hour). The coconut cream will rise to the top and can easily be skimmed off. To substitute cream in recipes, use equal parts coconut cream for the dairy cream. This work particularly well in sauces for seafood and poultry.  Of course, already prepared Coconut Cream can be purchased in stores or online.\n\n------\n\n**Low Fat Soy Cream Alternative**\n\nBlend Silken Tofu until smooth. This works as an excellent cream substitute when a thickener is needed in sauces and soups. Choose medium firm or firm varieties for a thicker \u201ccream\u201d. Pureed tofu can be substituted for heavy cream using a 1:1 ratio and is a much healthier, lower fat option.\n\n------\n\n**Milk + Oil Heavy Cream Equivalent**\n\nBlend 2/3 cup of soy or rice milk with 1/3 cup melted dairy free margarine or oil (we like extra light olive oil for cooking).

Even at high temperatures, a sauce with a high concentration of gelatin will be thick. Think of a classic glace de viande. This type of sauce can be a quarter gelatin, very high concentration.\n\nAs you say though, you won't notice the gelatin in this sauce as a thickener. I agree (at least in terms of viscosity) since you really need to get up to around 10% gelatin by weight to make a discernible difference, and at this concentration it will quickly congeal as it cools.\n\nHowever, the mouthfeel of a sauce can be impacted by lower gelatin concentrations. Gelatin molecules are typically long and obstruct the free movement of water throughout the sauce, making it feel heavier and silkier in the mouth.\n\nNote too that sauces thickened with starches will also gel up at cooler temperatures. Cornstarch, like other grain starches, has a relatively high proportion of amylose (as opposed to amylopectin), which means it quickly congeals as it cools.\n\nGelatin is preferred to cornstarch in situations where the sauce should be translucent and not cloudy looking.\n\nInfo is from [*On Food and Cooking* by Harold McGee](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Cooking-Science-Lore-Kitchen/dp/0684800012)", "id": "d5ieh0c"}, {"comment": "Not sure if you are using gelatin correctly, because it will never clump up  if you keep the concentration reasonable, and also stir enough to dissolve fully.

Keep in mind that the volume will roughly double and it's pretty easy to figure out. Stir it a couple of times and set the timer for 30 minutes. Check on it at 30 minutes-it will either be done or close to it, I've never had it take more then 45 mins.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind, if you're a fan of savory and/or spicy dishes like I am, you're going to want to add extra seasonings to the starting recipe because that rice is going to cut down the intensity a fair amount.\n\nAnother thing I occasionally do with rice in a crock.

They're expensive, but worth it if you use it like an outdoor oven. I cook meat, pizza, pies, you name it.\n\nAs for the sous vide ribs, meh. Getting an immersion circulator is a bit like getting your first slow cooker. You use it for everything. You are also likely to tell everyone how much better sous vide is for just about everything at the sake of sounding pretentious. It happens to almost everyone.\n\nThen you start realizing that while it may technically cook things perfectly, it's all the same. A lot of cooked sous vide lacks soul or personality.\n\nThat said, I love my circulator and use it a couple times a week. Lean cuts of meat (chicken, pork, filet mignon, et al.) cooked sous vide are phenomenal. Sous vide also excels at reheating food to the point that it tastes completely fresh, no joke. I make a mean smoked cajun meatloaf and do about 15 lbs. of it at a time. I divide, vacuum seal, and freeze the leftovers. Using the circulator to bring it back up to 131F, it tastes exactly as it did fresh out of the smoker. In some ways it has even replaced my slow cooker. I do my pot roasts in it now too because I can cook it all in a bag at precisely 185F.\n\nMany of the things that slow cookers do well \u2013 chiefly unattended low and slow cooking \u2013 immersion circulators do better. It's also very, very difficult to overcook things sous vide. You can do short ribs for 24h up to 72h and there really isn't much difference in texture.\n\nIf you've been thinking about it, get one. Also make sure to get a food sealer. You'll want one as a companion to sous vide, but I also couldn't live without one in my kitchen now. Food stays fresher so much longer it's almost surreal.", "id": "d3zhjqs"}, {"comment": "Recipe for that Cajun meatloaf? Sounds delish ", "id": "d449uv2"}, {"comment": "Sure. Keep in mind that this is a huge recipe and makes a little over 10lbs. of meatloaf. Meatloaf freezes fantastically, though. Sometimes I make a giant 10 lb. loaf and sometimes I make 10 1lb. mini loafs. One time I made two 5 lb. round loafs so I could stack them and frost them with mashed potatoes like a cake (it was awesome).\n\n* From Costco, I get a 3 pack of organic grass fed beef. I think it comes out to 4 lbs. of beef.\n* Also from Costco, a 4 pack of mild Italian sausage in casings. I use 2 packs of the sausage (the other two go into my spaghetti sauce). Remove the sausage from the casings. I believe this comes out to about 3-3.5 lbs. of sausage. \n* 1 giant yellow onion (I normally use a Vidalia), minced.\n* 1 green bell pepper, minced.\n* 1 yellow bell pepper, minced.\n* 1 orange bell pepper, minced.\n* 1 red bell pepper, minced.\n* ~2 carrots, minced.\n* 4 celery stalks, minced.\n* 2 tbsp. garlic, minced.\n* 1 stick (1/4 lb) unsalted butter\n* 2 tbsp. salt\n* 1 tbsp black pepper\n* 1 tsp white pepper\n* 1 tsp red pepper\n* 1 tsp cumin\n* 1 tsp nutmeg\n* 1 cup heavy cream\n* 1.5 cups ketchup\n* 3 tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n* 2 tbsp Tabasco sauce\n* 3 cups breadcrumbs. I use 3 sleeves of ritz crackers run through a food processor because I always seem to have ritz crackers and I never seem to have 3 cups of breadcrumbs handy.\n* 5 eggs beaten and strained through a mesh sieve\n\nNow on to the making of it:\n\n1. Melt butter in a very large skillet and cook down all of the vegetables until they start to stick to the pan a little. There is going to be a lot of liquid in the pan from the vegetables, so this can take longer than 30 minutes depending on the size of your pan.\n1. Once the veggies are cooked, add in all of the dry seasoning, and liquids. Cook down until the mixture thickens and starts sticking to the pan. Don't let it burn. This can also take a half hour or so.\n1. Pour your mixture into a large stainless steel bowl and let it cool to room temperature. I use a spatula to stir it every 5-10 minutes to help speed up the process.\n1. When the mixture is cool, add the meat, eggs and breadcrumbs and mix it thoroughly. You don't want a big chunk of sausage or a pocket of egg in there, it'll ruin someones meal.\n\nAt this point, you can put it in the oven at 350-400 until the center hits 150ish, or you can take it to the next level:\n\nI then take my mixture and make my loaf or loafs. If I'm doing one large loaf, I get a large baking sheet and I form my loaf about 2 inches thick. You want a lot of surface area for the next part.\nPut your loaf(s) in the smoker for an hour with your favorite wood.\nIt is at this point that you will want to put your glaze on if that's your thing. My buys like ketchup on theirs, but my daughter and I prefer gravy (recipe to follow), so I just leave it alone.\nTurn it up to 325-350 and cook until the center reaches 150.\nRemove from smoker/bbq, cover with aluminum foil and set aside to cool.\n\nWhile it's cooling, you should make this gravy. Not any gravy, this gravy, for this is the best brown gravy you will ever have and I have cooked gallons of gravy perfecting it. In my house, this is called *The Gravy*.\n\n1. Melt 4 tbsp butter in a sauce pan and whisk in 8 tbsp of flour.\n1. Cook the flour in the butter until it browns and has a nutty smell and no longer smells like flour. Takes about 5 minutes or so.\n1. Turn stovetop down to low.\n1. Now add 2 cups of water, whisking vigorously as you pour it in. You may need more water toward the end, but start with 2 cups.\n1. Now add enough chicken bouillon for 2 cups of water\n1. Now add enough beef bouillon for 2 cups of water\n1. Now add in salt and pepper to your taste.\n1. Now add in secret ingredient #1: 1 tbsp (or more!) of rubbed sage. This is the differentiator right here.\n1. Now add in secret ingredient #2: Kitchen Bouquet. Just a tbsp will do. This gives the gravy a nice dark brown color and it gives a unique taste.\n1. You want to always be whisking when you're making this. Don't try to make this while you're cooking something else, it won't turn out right. I use a wire whisk with very fine wires so it flexes enough to scrap the bottom of the pan and it works well.\n\nIt probably took you 10 minutes to make the gravy. The meatloaf has had time to rest and the juices inside have equalized. You may now serve the meatloaf, slathered in this delicious gravy. You definitely should have made some mashed potatoes to go with this too.\n\nMashed potatoes are easy. Use starchy potatoes (bakers are good) and boil them until they're done. Drain and mash along with a ton of butter, heavy cream, a touch of horse radish and some garlic powder, salt, and pepper.\n\nOr you can just come to my place for dinner with the family next time you're in Oregon :)", "id": "d45alyx"}, {"comment": "For the British folks who want to try this out.

Full disclaimer: I am not of Mexican heritage so I hope someone can tell me how to make this better (although this one is pretty damn good if I do say so myself). \n\nThis recipe was written for green tomatoes because we had an over-abundance of them this summer, but I would just use tomatillos if you can get them. They are NOT the same although you can substitute them (sort of) by adding acid; see recipe notes.\n\nGreen Chicken Posole\n\nPrep time: 30 min\nCook time: 2.5-3 hours\nServings: 8?\n\nIngredients\n*2 cups chopped onion\n*6 garlic cloves, smashed and roughly chopped\n*1.5 lb green tomatoes or tomatillos (see notes), roughly chopped\n*6-7 Anaheim peppers. De-seed all but 2 depending on desired spice level.\n*1 Poblano pepper, roughly chopped and de-seeded\n*1 jalapeno, quartered, with seeds\n*1 cup frozen chopped spinach\n*Enough water/chicken broth to cover (see notes)\n*2 Tbsp dried Oregano\n*3-4 Bay leaves\n*1 cup chopped fresh cilantro (optional but not really)\n*2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar\n*Juice of 1 lime\n*1 tsp sugar\n*Salt to taste\n*Olive oil\n*1 28 oz can of hominy\n*2 lb chicken, bone in and skin on (used 6 large drumsticks)\n*250 mL beer (optional but replace volume with water or broth. Beer should not be too hoppy; use a lager or something inoffensive)\n\nFor garnish:\n*Cilantro\n*Chopped cabbage, avocado or radish\n*Lime wedges\n*Cotija cheese or other cheese\n\nMethod\n\nChop all vegetables as indicated. De-seed all Anaheim peppers except 2, depending on desired spice level.\n\nSautee onion and garlic in olive oil until softened. Add chopped green tomatoes/tomatillos and sautee for about 15 minutes, until juices are released. Add all chopped chilis and chopped spinach and cook for another 10 minutes. Add oregano, bay leaves, and salt.\n\nCover in water/chicken broth and bring to boil. Add apple cider vinegar and lime juice. Adjust acidity with sugar. Simmer for about 1 hr until everything is softened. Add fresh cilantro if using 30 minutes before end (approx 1 cup chopped).\n\nWhile the vegetables are cooking, brown chicken in another pot in olive oil, approximately 10 minutes. Once all sides are browned, add beer and water to cover; bring to boil. Cook chicken for 1 hour until falling off bone; remove skin and bones, shred, and set aside.\n\nOnce vegetables are softened, remove the bay leaves and use hand blender to blend until smooth. Add back the chicken and cook for another 30 minutes.\nServe with cilantro, chopped cabbage/avocado/radish, lime wedges, and cheese to garnish.\n\nNotes:\n*Green tomatoes have less juice and acidity than tomatillos, so tomatillos are highly recommended. Compensate with apple cider vinegar as needed\n*Used about 8 cups water + 3 Tbsp Better than Boullion\n*Cubed pork shoulder also acceptable\n", "id": "czn5l4q"}, {"comment": "Thank you!

I had an apple-themed party last week, and wanted to go the savory route. Admittedly, this is more sweet than savory. Serve it either by itself, or pair it with apple\u2019s favorite cheese (cheddar) and caramelized onions.\n\nThe meat:\n\n* 5-6lb Pork Shoulder, bone-in or bone-out \n\n\nThe Apples:\n\n* 3 Gala Apples (to cook with)\n\n* Optional: 1 Red Delicious Apple (to mix into the pork)\n\n\nThe Rub:\n\n* 2 tsp Paprika\n* 2 tsp Brown Sugar\n* 2 tsp Garlic Powder\n* 1 tsp Ground Mustard\n* 1 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n\nThe Glaze:\n\n* Up to 2 Qt Apple Cider\n* 1 tsp dry Sage\n* 1/2 tsp dry Thyme \n* 1 tsp Black Pepper\n* 1 Bay leaf\n* Salt to taste\n\n\nOthers:\n\n* 2-4 Large, White Onions\n* Kaiser Rolls\n* Cheddar\n* Red Wine\n* Apple Cider Vinegar\n\nEarly in the day:\n\nTrim the pork. Coat it with the rub, then brown it. Peel and slice up the gala apples, and place them on the bottom of your slow cooker. Once the pork is browned, put it on top of the apples. Optionally, add a mixture of cider, apple cider vinegar, and red wine as liquid. Max 1 cup total liquid (I recommend less). Cook for 6 on high or 10 on low.\n\nI use a small slowcooker to start the caramelized onion process. Slice 2 to 4 onions, then soften on the stove with oil. Use the apple cider as your liquid. Place in slow cooker. Cook on low alongside the pork.\n\nLater in the day:\n\nThe pork is done when it falls apart as you take it out. Pull it! Keep an eye out for chunks of fat. \n\nStart the glaze. Use 2 cups of cider as your base. You can also add some of the fluid left over from the cooking as well. Mix in your herbs. Reduce to a watery-thick result (but not too thick). Dilute with water or cider as needed. Add salt to taste. Mix with pork when done! Skin and dice an apple into the pork for extra crunch.\n\nFinish your caramelized onions on the stove. \n\nServe on a roll with a slice of cheddar and a layer of caramelized onions.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Can I use hard cider?\nYes, but I strongly recommend regular cider. Regular cider is more flavorful whereas hard cider is more filtered. You could always use both.\n\n* Can I use other apples?\nYes. I used gala because they were on sale. I used red delicious because I am not allergic to them raw.\n\n* Is there a BBQ variant?\nYes, if you want to make a BBQ version, thicken the glaze so it\u2019s almost like honey, then mix with bbq sauce in a 1:2 to 1:3 ratio (glaze to bbq) depending on how much apple flavor you want.\n\n* Do I have to add an apple to the pulled pork?\nNo, I added it for additional apple-ness and texture. However, fresh apples in the pulled pork is very good when the pulled pork is eaten by itself (instead of in a bun, though it\u2019s also good in a bun)."], [6, "OP, you should look into bear claw shredders.

I had an apple-themed party last week, and wanted to go the savory route. Admittedly, this is more sweet than savory. Serve it either by itself, or pair it with apple\u2019s favorite cheese (cheddar) and caramelized onions.\n\nThe meat:\n\n* 5-6lb Pork Shoulder, bone-in or bone-out \n\n\nThe Apples:\n\n* 3 Gala Apples (to cook with)\n\n* Optional: 1 Red Delicious Apple (to mix into the pork)\n\n\nThe Rub:\n\n* 2 tsp Paprika\n* 2 tsp Brown Sugar\n* 2 tsp Garlic Powder\n* 1 tsp Ground Mustard\n* 1 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n\nThe Glaze:\n\n* Up to 2 Qt Apple Cider\n* 1 tsp dry Sage\n* 1/2 tsp dry Thyme \n* 1 tsp Black Pepper\n* 1 Bay leaf\n* Salt to taste\n\n\nOthers:\n\n* 2-4 Large, White Onions\n* Kaiser Rolls\n* Cheddar\n* Red Wine\n* Apple Cider Vinegar\n\nEarly in the day:\n\nTrim the pork. Coat it with the rub, then brown it. Peel and slice up the gala apples, and place them on the bottom of your slow cooker. Once the pork is browned, put it on top of the apples. Optionally, add a mixture of cider, apple cider vinegar, and red wine as liquid. Max 1 cup total liquid (I recommend less). Cook for 6 on high or 10 on low.\n\nI use a small slowcooker to start the caramelized onion process. Slice 2 to 4 onions, then soften on the stove with oil. Use the apple cider as your liquid. Place in slow cooker. Cook on low alongside the pork.\n\nLater in the day:\n\nThe pork is done when it falls apart as you take it out. Pull it! Keep an eye out for chunks of fat. \n\nStart the glaze. Use 2 cups of cider as your base. You can also add some of the fluid left over from the cooking as well. Mix in your herbs. Reduce to a watery-thick result (but not too thick). Dilute with water or cider as needed. Add salt to taste. Mix with pork when done! Skin and dice an apple into the pork for extra crunch.\n\nFinish your caramelized onions on the stove. \n\nServe on a roll with a slice of cheddar and a layer of caramelized onions.\n\nNotes:\n\n* Can I use hard cider?\nYes, but I strongly recommend regular cider. Regular cider is more flavorful whereas hard cider is more filtered. You could always use both.\n\n* Can I use other apples?\nYes. I used gala because they were on sale. I used red delicious because I am not allergic to them raw.\n\n* Is there a BBQ variant?\nYes, if you want to make a BBQ version, thicken the glaze so it\u2019s almost like honey, then mix with bbq sauce in a 1:2 to 1:3 ratio (glaze to bbq) depending on how much apple flavor you want.\n\n* Do I have to add an apple to the pulled pork?\nNo, I added it for additional apple-ness and texture. However, fresh apples in the pulled pork is very good when the pulled pork is eaten by itself (instead of in a bun, though it\u2019s also good in a bun).", "id": "d9cpp07"}, {"comment": "This might be a dumb question, but do the apples from the bottom of the slow cooker end up just getting mixed in with the pork?

The goal of the CS lines isn't to solve your problem, the goal is to get you to leave them alone while minimizing the possibility of you saying anything bad about the company for the smallest possible cost.  Most of the time, solving the problem is the easiest way to do that but, not always.\n\nThe first step is to establish that you're on the same side, empathize with you, and convince you that the company cares about your problem. (This is the one that 'seemed' like she really wanted to help you).  They're trained specifically to make you like them and, some of them have been practicing for years.\n\nThe next step is to convince you that they're going to do something about it (In this case, sending it back to their 'engineering team').  The engineering team may or may not have actually looked at it, there's also the added benefit of getting the product into their custody to minimize legal risks.  Where i worked, the engineering team was penalized in a roundabout way if they declared that the fault was with the product and, it would end up in a new engineer having to review it again anyways.  As a possible result of this, I never ever saw any safety issue be classified as a product fault.  If someone was lucky and the engineering report seemed... unsure, they'd sometimes be issued a free replacement as a show of goodwill (If it was especially bad, they'd mail you a hat and/or a tshirt too).\n\nYou're at the 3rd step now.  On step 3, the customer would usually just call back a few more times to complain and, then either give up or threaten a lawsuit (either way, it resulted in me not getting any interesting new case notes to read).  At this point, I couldn't say what happened but, my personal opinion is that the lawsuit probably wouldn't be worth it.

The goal of the CS lines isn't to solve your problem, the goal is to get you to leave them alone while minimizing the possibility of you saying anything bad about the company for the smallest possible cost.  Most of the time, solving the problem is the easiest way to do that but, not always.\n\nThe first step is to establish that you're on the same side, empathize with you, and convince you that the company cares about your problem. (This is the one that 'seemed' like she really wanted to help you).  They're trained specifically to make you like them and, some of them have been practicing for years.\n\nThe next step is to convince you that they're going to do something about it (In this case, sending it back to their 'engineering team').  The engineering team may or may not have actually looked at it, there's also the added benefit of getting the product into their custody to minimize legal risks.  Where i worked, the engineering team was penalized in a roundabout way if they declared that the fault was with the product and, it would end up in a new engineer having to review it again anyways.  As a possible result of this, I never ever saw any safety issue be classified as a product fault.  If someone was lucky and the engineering report seemed... unsure, they'd sometimes be issued a free replacement as a show of goodwill (If it was especially bad, they'd mail you a hat and/or a tshirt too).\n\nYou're at the 3rd step now.  On step 3, the customer would usually just call back a few more times to complain and, then either give up or threaten a lawsuit (either way, it resulted in me not getting any interesting new case notes to read).  At this point, I couldn't say what happened but, my personal opinion is that the lawsuit probably wouldn't be worth it.

Pour the chicken broth, 1/4-1/2 cup soy sauce (depending on your taste), 1/4 cup rice vinegar and fish sauce over the pork.

Add the cubed squash to a greased baking sheet and pour the curry mixture over the squash. Toss well. Bake for 30-40 minutes, tossing a couple of times during cooking. You want the squash to be lightly browned and crisp.\n\nMeanwhile, remove the pork from the crockpot and add the mushrooms. Cover the crockpot and crank the heat up to high. Lightly shred the pork with two forks or your hands.\n\nHeat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sesame oil. Once hot, add enough pork to cover just the surface of your skillet, do not over crowd the skillet. Sprinkle a little brown sugar over the pork, add 2 tablespoons soy sauce and 2 tablespoons rice vinegar, toss. Allow the pork to caramelize, about 2 minutes. Stir and allow the pork to continue to caramelize, about 3-5 minutes total. Remove the pork from the skillet, repeat with the remaining pork. Keep the pork warm.\n\nAdd the Ramen noodles to the crockpot and allow them to cook 5 minutes. Once the noodles are cooked, stir in only half of the pork. Ladle the soup into bowls. Top with extra caramelized pork, curry roasted acorn squash and an egg. Season the egg with salt and pepper, Add the carrots, jalape\u00f1os, green onions and cilantro if desired.

I don't tend to follow recipes but I did double check yours for inspiration, used the French onion soup as a base (usually I make my own base using tinned tomatoes or whatever to suit what I'm making, but I was feeling lazy).\n\nEnded up with whatever meat was on offer at the supermarket, so it's a pork and sausage (Cumberland pork sausage) stew. The joint of pork was pre marinaded with salt, pepper and a sprinkle of parsley, threw the whole lot in (fat and all) for flavour. Browned off well. Hopefully the fat should render down to add some amazing flavour, if not then it's large enough to remove easily when serving.\n\nI've ended up using cider also as I'm using pork (Pork loves cider), and by cider I mean alcoholic apple cider, Thatchers Vintage to be precise (uk - West Country's finest). Fresh crushed garlic also went in (not sure why you Americans love powdered stuff but I guess it keeps longer), onion salt, English mustard powder (again, pork loves mustard) and a bay leaf, along with thyme and a few other bits (can't remember precisely what else but pretty much your usual seasoning)\n\nI'm not cooking it for hours (eating tonight) so I par boiled my veg first (carrots, sweet potato and white potato) so it'll be done faster (will allow 1-2hrs). When browning the meat I threw in some glugs of cider for flavour and some mustard powder along with the flour, plus some of the Worcestershire sauce (I always tend to add liquid when browning off meat, not enough to swamp it but just enough to add flavour to the meat itself - strange habits).\n\nI also used the potato / carrot water added into the stew to get the right consistency that I was after. I have plenty left over so as it cooks over the next hour I have plenty more to make sure it ends up as I want it. Using your vegetable water is an amazing way to maximise flavour - even tasting that water now is lovely, as its sweet and delicious, so adds a lovely sweetness into the main stew. No point wasting it and using fresh water, I find it strange how people throw their cooking water away and use normal water instead. Seems crazy. \n\nIt's obviously a very different recipe, but thank you for reminding me of the awesomeness of a good stew. If this turns out well then I'll stick up a full recipe for others, as I very much tend to make things up as I go along most of the time, based around whatever I have in the kitchen at the time or whatever I find on offer/reduced when I'm shopping :)\n\n"], [-7, "[deleted]"]], [[{"comment": "Roll recipe please!", "id": "d8sm3b6"}, {"comment": "1 Cup warm water\n\n1 teaspoon granulated sugar\n\n1 package active dry yeast (2 tsp)\n\n1/2 Cup Milk Powder\n\n1 egg, slightly beaten\n\n1/3 Cup softened butter or margarine\n\n1/3 Cup granulated sugar\u00a0\n\n1 Teaspoon salt\n\n3 1/2 Cups AP flour (plus 1/4 cup for dusting, if needed)\n\n2 Tablespoons butter\n\n2 Tablespoons honey\n\nDissolve the tsp of sugar and yeast into the warm water and allow it to proof for 15-20 minutes,  until it's all foamy. \n\nMix in your milk powder, egg, butter or margarine, sugar, and salt,  and then slowly add flour, mixing well until a dough ball forms.  \n\nDump onto a well-floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes,  until the dough is elastic and silky smooth to the touch. \n\nButter a large bowl that has a lid, and put the dough in there with the lid in place.

When it comes out, it would be ready to divide into rolls and the final rise. \n\nI've made this roll recipe by hand a million times and with the bread machine fewer times, and both ways they come out super light and airy and perfect.

I don't tend to follow recipes but I did double check yours for inspiration, used the French onion soup as a base (usually I make my own base using tinned tomatoes or whatever to suit what I'm making, but I was feeling lazy).\n\nEnded up with whatever meat was on offer at the supermarket, so it's a pork and sausage (Cumberland pork sausage) stew. The joint of pork was pre marinaded with salt, pepper and a sprinkle of parsley, threw the whole lot in (fat and all) for flavour. Browned off well. Hopefully the fat should render down to add some amazing flavour, if not then it's large enough to remove easily when serving.\n\nI've ended up using cider also as I'm using pork (Pork loves cider), and by cider I mean alcoholic apple cider, Thatchers Vintage to be precise (uk - West Country's finest). Fresh crushed garlic also went in (not sure why you Americans love powdered stuff but I guess it keeps longer), onion salt, English mustard powder (again, pork loves mustard) and a bay leaf, along with thyme and a few other bits (can't remember precisely what else but pretty much your usual seasoning)\n\nI'm not cooking it for hours (eating tonight) so I par boiled my veg first (carrots, sweet potato and white potato) so it'll be done faster (will allow 1-2hrs). When browning the meat I threw in some glugs of cider for flavour and some mustard powder along with the flour, plus some of the Worcestershire sauce (I always tend to add liquid when browning off meat, not enough to swamp it but just enough to add flavour to the meat itself - strange habits).\n\nI also used the potato / carrot water added into the stew to get the right consistency that I was after. I have plenty left over so as it cooks over the next hour I have plenty more to make sure it ends up as I want it. Using your vegetable water is an amazing way to maximise flavour - even tasting that water now is lovely, as its sweet and delicious, so adds a lovely sweetness into the main stew. No point wasting it and using fresh water, I find it strange how people throw their cooking water away and use normal water instead. Seems crazy. \n\nIt's obviously a very different recipe, but thank you for reminding me of the awesomeness of a good stew. If this turns out well then I'll stick up a full recipe for others, as I very much tend to make things up as I go along most of the time, based around whatever I have in the kitchen at the time or whatever I find on offer/reduced when I'm shopping :)\n\n", "id": "d8tdddv"}, {"comment": "It's stew!

Steak cuts are made up almost entirely of muscle and fat. It starts out tender, and should be cooked hot and fast, so that the interior doesn't reach too high a temperature, typically under 150 degrees farenheit. The fat softens, the muscle fibers remain relatively tender, and you end up with a great steak.\n\nCooking a steak cut of beef long and slow, on the other hand, will result in a hockey puck, because the muscle fibers contract the hotter they get (most slow cookers operate at around 200 degrees). The fat renders out, the muscle fibers contract, and all you're left with is a lump of muscle fiber with all the liquid squeezed out.\n\nSo when slow cooking beef, you should stick to roasts that have a lot of tough connective tissue in them.

Yes, she knew about it while they were still only engaged. But despite her love of garlic and knowing full well she'd have to give it up to be with him, she went ahead and married him anyway. \n\nThis meant she suddenly had to remove all things garlic from her life she wouldn't give Woodrow a erection. I mean, this was a woman that brushed her teeth with garlic. I mean that literally. When the woman burped, it smelled like the dumpster behind the local Macaroni Grill had caught fire and an old Sicilian woman was stuck inside it while it burned. Needless to say, it wasn't an easy thing to give up all at once. But she loved Woodrow and wanted to make him happy, so she found ways to make it work. On a side note, her secret weapon ended up being cheez wiz. Turns out, the stuff does a great job of replacing the savory flavor profile of fresh chopped garlic. Also, you can dispense it from a cannister, just like whipped cream, which is just convenient as heck.\n\nTen years into the marriage and things are good. That's when my grandmother made the fateful decision to visit the Garlic Festival two towns over, the very one she had loved so much as a child and as a tween and as a teen and as a twenty-something and as a dirty-thirty and as a flirty-forty and as a sexy-sixty, but had given up when she married Woodrow. \n\nWell, Woodrow was apprehensive when she told him of her desire to attend. But she insisted she would take all the necessary precautions to ensure she didn't bring back any garlic into their home. Reluctantly, Woodrow agreed to let her go, but only on the condition that I, her most competent of grandchildren (had both a driver's license in good standing and no outstanding warrants within the state), accompany her.\n\nAt the Garlic Festival, my grandmother quickly tossed any designs on moderation she may have had out the window and instead set about making up for lost time. Just a couple hours in, she'd already drunk eight Mason jars of garlic wine, consumed two loaves of garlic bread, devoured an entire sheet tray of lemon-garlic bars with garlic crumb topping and garlic frosting, and insulted four out of five finalists for that year's Queen of the Garlic Festival competition.\n\nSoon after her arousing start to the day, I decided to sober her up a little with some garlic water and garlic coffee (with sugar derived from garlic). Turned out to be too little, too late, though. She puked up just about everything she took into her body that day so far. It smelled like ham and old cheese, which just didn't make any sense at all.\n\nOn the way back home, we stopped at a truck stop so I could hose her down and burn her clothes so that she didn't bring any garlic back to Woodrow. Then, while I was inside trying to aquire a sheet to cover her with and some road sodas to further flush the garlic from her system (I was also thirsty), my grandmother managed to make almost four dollars. I asked how she came by this windfall. She told me she simply showed a few truckers in the parking lot how she could still touch her toes in spite of her advancing years. She guessed they gave her the money to show their appreciation. I said that was cool, then took the cash and got more beer with it. \n\nWe finished the journey home in near silence, save for the occasional toot that emanated from my now sleeping grandmother's rear end. When we got home, I carried her all the way to bed. After assuring Woodrow that she was garlic-free, I retired myself. \n\nThe next day, I awoke to the sounds of Woodrow screaming. I found him in the bathroom, moaning in pain and pealing layers of skin off his lips. All around his mouth, there were red blisters, oozing a yellowish-clear substance. I thought I had either stumbled onto the set of a David Cronenberg film or Woodrow had picked up a super strain of the herp and it was now eating his fave. As I got closer, however, I encountered an unmistakable odor that cleared up the mystery: garlic. \n\nAfter taking Woodrow to the doctor, it was quickly deduced that he had had an allergic reaction to garlic remnants he encountered on my grandmother's person. Now, I was certain to cleanse all the areas of my grandmother I deemed important before bringing her back to him. Her vaginga was not one of those places, though. I guess I just figured that old Woodrow's muff diving days were over. I figured wrong.\n\nFortunately, some topical ointment and bed rest helped Woodrow make a full recovery within a week (though his lips still looked a bit chapped). I must have apologized a hundred times to him. Told him if it came to it, I'd never shy away from hosing out my grandmother's naughty bits ever again. And my grandmother promised to never bring garlic around him in any form, either. This turned out to be an easy promise to keep because Woodrow got hit by a schoolbus just two weeks later. Died on impact. So, yeah, there is such a thing as \"too much garlic.\"\n\n", "id": "d97rkje"}, {"comment": "Wow, here I am witnessing a fresh Vargas post in /r/slowcooking. \n\nWhat a day.

She literally had garlic on everything! From garlic scented candles to garlic mothballs, even garlic infused shampoo, the list goes on and on. She loves herself a daily cup of garlic coffee (very much like your grandmother), in the morning. She also has several recipes for garlic syrup which could be used to treat anything from the most common colds to erectile dysfunction - not that I would know, of course.\n\nHonestly speaking, gran gran grew up in a very superstitious family. On a fateful Hallowe'en night when she was six, gran gran had a traumatic experience involving drunk teens and expertly applied red dye, which kick started her obsession for all things anti-vampire.\n\nSilver cross, wooden stake, bulbs of garlic, holy water, you name it, gran gran got it. She was really dedicated, religiously lugging a pail of water to Sunday mass so she could have a weekly holy water rinse to ward off vampires. Well, that was just the starting point of her love for garlic. \n\nGran gran used to take a bulb of garlic everywhere she went, just in case she was about to be ambushed by bloodsuckers. However, everything changed when the fire nati- oops, I meant, when she forgot to take her lunchbox to school. \n\nYou see, schools back then didn't have cafeterias that serve decent tasting food. I know because my gran gran made me what she was served back then - horribly bitter mashed potatoes and some vegetables with a sickly yellow sauce of watery consistency. \n\nBut I digress. Gran gran was in a fix. Faced with the prospect of shoveling spoonfuls of that gross mush down, gran gran decided to eat the only thing she brought around with her at all times. You got it, the bulb of garlic. \n\nRather than starve for the day, gran gran peeled off the skin and gingerly stuffed a clove into her mouth. Biting into the garlic which has been aged for a few weeks, the texture and the garlic juice were the only things on gran gran's mind. The crunchiness of the garlic prompted gran gran to stuff everything else, skin included, into her mouth. If anything, she was definitely experiencing her first foodgasm, and the start of garlic as the center of her universe.\n\nThat very event led gran gran to who she is today, and by claiming that there is such a thing as \"too much garlic\" is an affront to this beautiful strong (smelling) garlic lady. \n\nI request that a formal apology be made to my gran gran, and she'd most definitely accept your apology over a cup of hot garlic tea, she's lovely like that.", "id": "d9gykdc"}, {"comment": "Good sear on it too.

We had a dog that wouldn't eat kibble unless there was wet dog food mixed in. The wet dog food wasn't so unappealing at room temperature, but because the dog only ate half a can at a time we usually had an open can in the fridge, and for some reason cooling it down made the smell much more potent and unpleasant, and it also congealed the liquid.\n\nThe smell and sight of the canned dog food, with the chunks of meat and peas and carrots sitting in the congealed liquid, made me gag every time I had to take it out and mix it up with the kibble to make the dog's dinner.
