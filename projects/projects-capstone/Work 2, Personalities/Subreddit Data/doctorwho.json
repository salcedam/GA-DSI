No doubt Starz has some form of exclusivity and control over another series of Torchwood and this may be the holdup. BBC can't just say \"Yes!\", they'll need Starz to say \"Yes!\" too and I'm guessing something has gone wrong there. Maybe BBC and Starz had a little spat and Starz has too much of an \"ego\" to patch things over for the sake of Torchwood. Maybe Starz won't agree to another series if it doesn't take place in America/continue the plotlines set up in Miracle Day, which is troublesome if BBC/Davies want to return the series to the UK for a back to basics refresh, especially since it wouldn't make sense to continue the Miracle Day plotlines anyway. it's been too long. If Torchwood comes back, it needs to be a total reboot with Jack being the only member of the original team to return (Gwen's story is done, leave her be) and introduce a whole new team. The Miracle Day plotline should be wrapped up by the team at Big Finish (under guidance from Davies) to allow Torchwood to be fresh when it comes back. \n\nAs to the other possible egos holding Torchwood back, it's likely not any of the other actors because the characters would just be written out. This means the \"egos\" must be someone on a producer or executive level. \n\nHowever I'm willing to bet it's Starz. It wouldn't be the first time a partnership between BBC and an American network has turned sour. Look at BBC and Universal. Characters from the Movie are still off limits and Universal is refusing to let BBC use them for anything outside of comics as well as denying BBC access to the original film elements; which is why the upcoming Blu-Ray release of the Movie will be an upscale of the SD version of the movie rather than a re-scan of the film at HD.

If it is successful and gets a second season I imagine the idea of another spin off will be whole-heartedly supported by more people. Torchwood is also a good link back to the RTD era and that will create a stronger universe for the show. There is still a massive hole between the two eras of NuWho, which whilst is completely understandable, fair and probably the smarter way of doing it, that the return of Torchwood could easily rectify.

Maybe BBC and Starz had a little spat and Starz has too much of an \"ego\" to patch things over for the sake of Torchwood. Maybe Starz won't agree to another series if it doesn't take place in America/continue the plotlines set up in Miracle Day, which is troublesome if BBC/Davies want to return the series to the UK for a back to basics refresh, especially since it wouldn't make sense to continue the Miracle Day plotlines anyway. it's been too long. If Torchwood comes back, it needs to be a total reboot with Jack being the only member of the original team to return (Gwen's story is done, leave her be) and introduce a whole new team. The Miracle Day plotline should be wrapped up by the team at Big Finish (under guidance from Davies) to allow Torchwood to be fresh when it comes back. \n\nAs to the other possible egos holding Torchwood back, it's likely not any of the other actors because the characters would just be written out.

The idea of setting Torchwood in the U.S. sounds like a pretty good idea.

And, in Series 2 at least, it made alien invasions a part of everyday life for the people of Cardiff. The old woman saying \"Bloody Torchwood!\" is hilarious because she's treating a high speed car chase with a blowfish Alien through the streets of Cardiff as if it was a minor inconvenience at best. Torchwood was an excellent deconstruction of Sci-Fi dramas because it felt real. But not in the sense it was gritty, but in the sense that everyone felt like real people. Even the aliens. The aliens want to drink and have sex like the rest of us. Hell, the 456 were just drug addicts looking for their next fix! It's this sort of deconstruction that just doesn't work when you become what you're deconstructing. Put simply, Torchwood lost what made it unique when it stopped deconstructing US Sci-Fi dramas and instead became one. The fact these big alien plots and invasions were happening in the back streets of Cardiff was what made Torchwood unique. It was a great deconstructions. Move it out of Cardiff or the UK and it loses that. \n\nAnd see... I don't think Jack's backstory needs fleshing out. He's like the Doctor, take the mystery away and it's no fun anymore. Just as we've never found out what the answer to the question \"Doctor Who?\" is, we'll never find out Jack's backstory. And that's fine. It makes him more mysterious.

Like what do shadowy government agencies do when they can't just kill people who try to blab their secrets? What do gangsters and really bad people do to their enemies when they know they can torture them forever without killing them? What happens if there's an earthquake or a natural disaster? What happens to all the people who would normally have been killed? Do thousands of them just shamble along to the next city over like zombies and horrify everyone? And when they figure out how to put things back to normal, they'd essentially be killing all the people who should have died but didn't. There could be some moral grey area there.\n\nAlso I think Jack's thing could have had a bit more weight to it. That might have been his only chance to die, perhaps for billions of years. If he knew that, and he only had a very small window of opportunity to decide if he wanted to die or essentially keep on fighting and possibly suffering forever, they could have gone a bit heavier into that I thought. \n\nAlso if they had to make someone else immortal at the end IMO it should have been Gwen, not that other dude who nobody liked. :)", "id": "d7g1y43"}, {"comment": "I don't think the fact that only Jack could die easily was the problem.

I think you're just making stuff up. \n\nFor one, if it is Moffat it's incredibly unprofessional of Barrowman to divulge this information. That sort of behaviour can get you blacklisted in the industry. Barrowman would not risk his career just to tell one fan something he shouldn't. Not to mention that, as with anything Doctor Who related, Barrowman would be under an NDA and would be in breach of that contract for divulging this. This is also ignoring that Barrowman is not the type of guy to talk shit about someone, especially a producer. \n\nTwo, Moffat is not in control of Torchwood. His influence extends to Doctor Who the show only. Not the franchise as a whole. This isn't like Marvel, where Kevin Feige controls all or the DC TV universe where Greg Berlanti runs all the shows. Moffat only runs Doctor Who the TV Show. Not the franchise itself. Sure, BBC can consult him on other Doctor Who related projects (such as Class) but he doesn't have a ton of influence on the franchise itself outside the TV show. If BBC want something to happen he doesn't want, then it's tough titties. It's going to happen. \n\nThree, Moffat has made it clear in the past he likes Torchwood and would like to see it return one day not to mention that he and Russell are best friends; Moffat still emails Russell when he's not too sure of a plot point/character and reguarly asks Russell to come back and writing an episode to the point where some episodes are \"backup scripts\" if Russell or another writer they're after decide they're too busy (The Girl Who Waited was a backup script for an unknown writer who decided they were too busy and Fear Her was a backup script for a Stephen Fry episode that ended up being too expensive). Russell and Moffat are good friends, Moffat would not try and block anything Russell wanted to do with Doctor Who. \n\nFour, this paints Moffat as an evil mastermind determined to ruin the show as much as possible; a common way people who hate Moffat try to depict him when the truth is there is probably no one else working on the show who loves Doctor Who more than Moffat does, only Capaldi, Russell and Mark come close. Moffat loves the show so much, he made a villain of two lost serials from the 60s the main villain of Series 7!

Moffat has done an awful lot for the show. More than most of you realise. Fact is, BBC were heavily considering cancelling the show after The End Of Time as they thought no one could replace David Tennant. And when I mean heavily considering, they were really close to making the decision. Moffat was able to save the show. And that's just one of the many things Moffat has done to help the show. Without Moffat, the show would not be nearly as popular as it is today and would certainly not be getting the budget it currently gets; if it hadn't been cancelled already. You may not like Moffat's writing, but you can;t deny that he's done an awful lot for the show. So much so that he can turn around and say \"I'm going to do an episode where the Doctor is the only character\" and BBC will be fine with it, and it'll go on to become one of the most acclaimed episodes of the show ever. And let's not forget that Moffat's Doctor Who actually helped the show make it big internationally and saving the show from cancellation forever more; the show is now BBC's biggest export after Sherlock. Moffat has done so much for the show and the absolutely ungrateful attitude displayed by a vocal minority is sickening. You don't like Moffat's Doctor Who? Fine. No one likes every era of Doctor Who. But to act like he's actively trying to ruin the show when he's done a lot more than you realise to keep it going is sickening. Not many shows have producers who would go to the lengths that Moffat does to help the show. And Moffat's scripts are of such high quality (even if you may not think so) that they've attracted an extraordinary amount of talent to the show. Many guest actors have gone on record that it was the scripts that brought them in, not the show itself. Without Moffat, we never would have gotten Michael Gambon, Katehrine Jenkins, Frances Barber, Alex Kingston, Ian McKellen, Richard E. Grant etc. \n\nHe's done a lot for this show, and the ungrateful attitude by fans is sickening.

Also he mentions other obstacles and I'm betting Starz is one of those. I think Barrowman has the wrong idea and Moffat isn't doing it maliciously, he's just way too busy to oversee 4 shows at once. \n\nBut still incredibly unprofessional of Barrowman to divulge private information like this.

Anyway Barrowman doesn't work there any more, he's no longer under contract. Have you ever seen Barrowman do a con? The guy has NO filter. He'll dish the dirt, gossip, and badmouth anyone he thinks has behaved badly. He's said outrageous stuff and badmouthed people far worse, and yes he has been blacklisted from specific jobs and by specific people (eg the perfume campaign) but he's popular enough that it's not affected his career overall.\n\nI don't know that Moffat and RTD are best friends.

There's no maliciousness intended for Jack not coming back. Moffat isn't one for cheap fan service and won't bring Jack back for no reason. The only opportunity for Jack to come by came and went because Barrowman was too busy (Dorium was a quick replacement for Jack in A Good Man Goes To War). Moffat only brings back characters if he thinks there's a story worth telling on television (which is why River Song keeps coming back because Moffat still has plenty of stories to tell). Doctor Who is different to most dramas because it's always moving on and rarely has the same cast for more than 2 series. So I can see why Moffat may be reluctant to bring Jack for the sake of it. This is something a few fans don't grasp.  Moffat is purely about story. \n\nAnd honestly if Barrowman is indeed saying these things to fans, then I'm not surprised if he's rubbed people at BBC the wrong way. No fact it might not even be Moffat against a Jack return. It might be a BBC executive for all we know.\n\nAnd yes, NDAs are not common in British television.

In \"The Writer's Tale\", RTD makes clear he and Moffat are very good friends to the point where Moffat could pitch anything and they'd do it.

I recommend to just start watching it. The first episode in season 5 is a good introductory episode. (season 5 in general has good cgi and effects, as well as good actors). Once you've seen season 5, and know if you like it or not you can go back to the start.\n\nSeason 1 has decent acting and a good overal story, but suffers from badly aged effects and some (in my opinion) really bad episodes.\n\nIt starts getting a lot better after the introduction of David Tennant (10th doctor, season 2-4). He's a brilliant actor, and the way I understand it, him and Matt Smith (11th, season 5-7) are considered the best of the \"new Who series\".\n\nTennants introductory episode is a bit boring, which is why I recommend starting with season 5. (He's asleep/in a coma for most of it, with the companion from s1 having to deal with the aftermath of the seeming death of the previous doctor, his regeneration into his 10th form, and getting to grips with the fact that he's still the same man underneath it all). \n\nNow, I'm only telling you what I consider to be a good way to start. People have different opinions on the matter, but in my experience, the low quality of season 1 turns some people off. I still like the 9th doctor (Christopher Eccleston), and find his introductory episode to be good overall.

Here's what I want you to do. I want you to go to [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com), type in any entertainment related \"legally protected property\", now I want you to go ahead and tell that to every one of the shop owners you see pop up.\n\nSo I've been doing this for years, I do a lot of work with The Replica Prop Forum, and various other businesses that make money off of fan-made/designed products, AND I work in the entertainment industry in LA building and designing things that sometimes eventually get put up on the internet just like this. As long as you aren't a business mass producing a product that is already being sold, you're usually going to be fine, at most you'll get asked to stop. At best, the company in question will buy the design off of you.\n\nHere's the guidelines for these sorts of things, and the reason why nobody will ever go after someone like this over legal issues:\n\n1. You can't mass produce these. This is why any prop replicas come in \"runs\" and not made to order.\n1. You get paid for labor and materials, not for the design itself.\n1. You can't copy a product that is already being officially sold, and you especially can't market what you're selling as an officially licensed item(ie. You can't copy a shirt design and sell it as an official shirt.) \n1.  You have to do it as a fan or individual, not as a business. \n\nAfter that, legally, the most a company can actually do to you is send you a cease and desist letter, which is not a big deal, because then you just stop. Which is what happened with people selling Jayne hats from Firefly a few years ago. \n\nAnd now, because I am actually familiar with the legal use status' of the Starbucks logo specifically, and I'll just spitball that BBC has legal rights to the likeness of any Daleks, I'll just let you know that Starbucks can legally do absolutely nothing if someone uses \"Black image/likeness within green circle with white text\", IF it isn't being used to promote a business.  I believe you can use it within Parody. BBC does have the likeness of Daleks, so yeah that's a protected likeness but I highly doubt the BBC will go after anyone for this. Plus the BBC is notoriously loose with it's IPs which is why Daleks have appeared in everything from [Rugrats](http://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rugrats-1600x720.jpg), [Better Off Ted](http://www.geeksofdoom.com/GoD/img/2010/01/2010-01-02-dalek.png), and even [Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.](https://i.imgur.com/vWRwYb8.jpg).\n\nProbably way too much explanation for such a meaningless comment, and for that I apologize, but I've had pretty blah day, and I'm sick and tired of people who literally have no clue about these things always bringing this up when discussing small, personal, fan projects that people do in their free time.

Nine later claims to be 900 in *Aliens of London*, so that gives him about a century of life.  I like to think that most of that unseen time occurred before Rose, with a slightly more broken Doctor off the end of the Time War.  This has the potential for some really interesting Doctor-companion dynamics.  Some people prefer *Rose* to be his first post-regen story, and for them another gap exists.  At the end of *Rose* the Doctor dematerialises and rematerialises the TARDIS before telling Rose that the ship travels through time.  This gap has been used before in a short story, but it claims that the Doctor has recently regenerated, and at the end of it he goes back for Rose.  Another option is that the Doctor gets separated from Rose at some point.\n\nThe \"look at the ears\" comment in *Rose* makes a lot of people think he's newly regenerated, but there are hints from the same episode that suggest he's been around for awhile.  Clive shows Rose old sketches and photos of the Ninth Doctor in different times, wearing different clothes.  In *Aliens of London*, he's pictured in his [UNIT I.D.](http://i.imgur.com/2lzaxwj.gif?1) with longer hair, which could explain his earlier comment about his ears.  Russell T Davies was even asked about the scene in *Doctor Who Magazine* (485), and he explained that he intended for the Ninth Doctor to have been around for some time already by his first appearance.\n\nFrom DWM 485, Russell T Davies:\n\n> The Doctor saying \"Look at the ears\" as he looks in the mirror was added in the second draft, and could be taken to imply he has only recently regenerated. DWM asked Russell if this was meant to be the case. \"Well, I hate being prescriptive here, cos sometimes, when I give an opinion on a scene, because I'm the writer and producer, it can become a fact. When I much prefer it if you make your own mind up. But enough time has passed now so, for the record... No, I do not think he'd just regenerated. If you have certain physical features like big ears, or buck teeth, you look at them and sigh at them every time you look in the mirror. And I think, if you'd had eight different faces, even if you'd been in this current form for a hundred years, you'd still mutter at them. So it was meant as a nod to the fact that he'd once had other faces. But I wrote the Titanic stuff and Krakatoa assuming that the Ninth Doctor had been around for a while.

His predecessor claimed to be 900 years old in *Aliens of London*, but by *The End of Time* Ten was saying he was 906.  However, there are several instances of this incarnation spending many months away from his TARDIS.  He had all that time as John Smith in *Human Nature*, and he spent three years searching for Martha in *The Infinite Quest*.  This leads me to believe that he started lying about his age at some point, which fits perfectly with his personality.  It also allows more room for future adventures.\n\nThe strangeness in the Doctor's age isn't something new either.  In the Seventh Doctor's debut, *Time and the Rani*, he proved he was the same age as the Rani, 953.  And the *New Adventures* books that succeeded the show in the early 90's had the Doctor reach his 1000 year old birthday.  Both of these numbers are already much older than the age the Ninth Doctor gave in *Series 1*, but you also have to consider that the War Doctor claimed to be 400 years younger than the 1200ish year old Eleventh Doctor in *The Day of the Doctor*.  This means the Ninth Doctor started out at age 800 and lived for about a century.\n\nThe way to get around this is to take a look at the Eighth Doctor.  At the start of the *Eighth Doctor Adventures* books the Doctor claims to be 3 years old.  He explains that he's much older (in his 1000s), but that he decided to restart counting after regeneration.  This can be used to eliminate the discrepancies between the Classic and New Series ages.  Eight had a fairly long life, so for the War Doctor to have aged as much as he has (comparing his face between *The Night of the Doctor* and *The Day of the Doctor*), he must have either reset his age once more, possibly when he dropping his title, or he may have suffered severely from the effects of the Time War.\n\nThe Eighth Doctor also spends 100 years stuck on Earth in the [books](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Burning), and 600 years stuck on Orbis in the [audios](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Orbis_\\(audio_story\\)), making him one of the longest lived incarnations.  In the latter story he explains that sometimes he gives his age based on the planet he's at, so the numbers he gives might not be entirely truthful.  In fact it's highly unlikely that he's capable of keeping track of his age at all, which the Eleventh Doctor reiterates in *The Day of the Doctor*.  The Eighth Doctor also goes through several instances of amnesia, making the job of counting more difficult.", "id": "d4n32qm"}, {"comment": "Honestly, I'm not entirely sure *he* has any idea what his actual age even is anymore.\n\nGiven that 10 was a bit vain, I could easily see him thinking, \"Well, I can't be over a thousand. that'd be *ooold*.

I didn't say there's one coming right away, all I said was there's probably going to be one in which Capaldi, Smith and even still Tennant will be eligible to star in.\n\nAs for 7-9, this is beside your point, but let's just say providing the show is still airing that they hold off any sort of multi-Doctor special until the 75th anniversary. I'd say that is an occasion most certainly worthy of another special. That'd be in 2038, I'd wager we're somewhere near the 20th Doctor. McCoy will be 94 if alive, but unfortunately he's probably on his way out if not already passed. McGann would be 78, Eccleston 73. Now, this is 22 years from now, so let's just say Eccleston has a Baker-style turn of heart and decides he wants a cameo in the special, and let's say he actually does get written in and not shafted like 5-7 were this time around.

Toby Whitehouse has done much better writing, IMO, but they probably tabbed Chibnall over Whitehouse for his much more extensive TV experience in general.\n\nHis Torchwood work was mostly pretty solid to great. And, as we all know, Steven Moffat was able to write some of the series' best episodes before he came in as show runner and had a more mixed record. I think Moffat did very well with one-offs, but not always with a season-long cohesive story or even a two-part finale.

I felt that season 6 and 7 were broken up far too much, and left us desperate for more than what we were getting.\n\nBut in the last couple of years since the 50th, we've been gifted a lot of Doctor Who. This has been reflected in the sliding initial ratings in season 9. Season 9, which I would sat on a quality level was my favourite Who season. \n\nIn a good way, the last part of the season 9 arc was very heavy; and I think it ended at a decent point for a break. \n\nHopefully by the time The Christmas Special comes along, there'll be the huge excitement reinvigorated to the show that it deserves and it'll become an event.... which is always what Doctor Who should be. \n\nAlso Steven Moffat leaving.

Toby Whitehouse has done much better writing, IMO, but they probably tabbed Chibnall over Whitehouse for his much more extensive TV experience in general.\n\nHis Torchwood work was mostly pretty solid to great. And, as we all know, Steven Moffat was able to write some of the series' best episodes before he came in as show runner and had a more mixed record. I think Moffat did very well with one-offs, but not always with a season-long cohesive story or even a two-part finale.

I felt that season 6 and 7 were broken up far too much, and left us desperate for more than what we were getting.\n\nBut in the last couple of years since the 50th, we've been gifted a lot of Doctor Who. This has been reflected in the sliding initial ratings in season 9. Season 9, which I would sat on a quality level was my favourite Who season. \n\nIn a good way, the last part of the season 9 arc was very heavy; and I think it ended at a decent point for a break. \n\nHopefully by the time The Christmas Special comes along, there'll be the huge excitement reinvigorated to the show that it deserves and it'll become an event.... which is always what Doctor Who should be. \n\nAlso Steven Moffat leaving. As I've said above I like him a lot, I like what he did with the show. I am sad to see him go; but I like the feeling that a new exec brings.

Moffat brought in a LOT of darkness, more inter-personal conflicts, more realism. He showed that the Doctor can make actual mistakes that cannot be reversed (almost all drama was nulled out in the first few seasons, resolved to a win-win situation), e.g. with Clara.\n\nIMHO Moffat made the show into as popular as it is today. Sure, it does not sit well with hardcore fans, but it is like with the new Star Trek movies - it doesn't aim at the geek, but at the general population. And the general population does not care much about real sci-fi (much to my dismay), to them, a good sci-fi movie is like SW7, minimalized drama, much more shooting and \"cool scenes\". Guess what Moffat achieved ;)", "id": "daypz0q"}, {"comment": "I'm not sure how you can say Moffat era is darker than RTD era. RTD era is much darker in my opinion.\n\nThe toglophane and 'midnight' are darker than any of moffat's stuff because they show that ultimately when the chips are down even 'very nice' people can turn and become absolute horrors. Also found the death of 9 and 10, the dalek and cybermen storylines, and the bit where Davros shows the Doctor how he's made his ex-companions warriors very dark. The darkness in RTD comes from the disturbing aspects of humanity rather than the monsters on the screen. It comes from humans being the monsters. RTD explored both sides of humanity whereas moffat is focused on the positives. For those reasons I also feel like RTD was aimed at older viewers with the aforementioned darkness, innuendo and dealing with sexuality, suicide, genocide (by the doctor!), and has become more kid friendly since moffat took over.

In the RTD era you always felt like the story progressed and the characters developed a lot every episode, and the characters felt like real people.

It was meant to be a \"Boogeyman\". It wasn't dark, and at the end everything was a win-win. Nothing was really lost.\n\nOn the other hand, under Moffat, a lot darker lines came in. The Silence, the \"death\" of the Doctor shown on-screen as being fucking shot in the gut, and dangit, one River appearance had more sexual innuendos than a whole season with RTD (okay I might be a tad bit off here).\n\nOr the Dalek asylum. Or the re-birth of the cybermen. And so on. Not to mention the atmosphere itself grew darker, more mature. Gone are the wonky funky low budget TARDIS elements.

Nothing was really lost.\n\nActually, one of the interesting things about LotTL is that the future of Utopia is never averted. The Doctor resolves the paradox that allowed the Toclafane to conquer the world, he wipes that year from existence \u2013 but the future destiny of the human race is still, ultimately, to become the Toclafane. The human race will become corrupted, insane murder-machines who travel back in time to kill their own ancestors \"because it's fun!\" \n\nRTD once said that \"Doctor Who is about death.\" Under the candy-colours and pop music there's a streak of darkness a mile wide in his stories. Moffat, by contrast, \"can't bear to kill characters off.\" Pretty much every time he kills a character he finds a way to write them back to life \u2013 Clara's dead!

Some of this is to do with how television is consumed these days, viewing figures were higher across the board in the 2000s, but under RTD Doctor Who's profile grew year on year, and it was never more enormous in the UK than during David Tennant's last series. The merchandising, the events, the branded yoghurts of all things - everything was blockbuster. I don't know whether it's due to fatigue or scheduling or the storylines or what, but it seems true that it's nothing like as big any more. It's scaled down a lot.\n\nMy take on Moffat's edition is rather the opposite of yours, which is that they've succeeded in capturing fans abroad, but it's for dedicated fans. Russell T Davies' Doctor Who was the biggest show in the UK. Steven Moffat's is a more niche show but one that is reaching its target audience in many more different countries. It remains popular and probably has more eyes on it than ever, but the hardcore fans aren't the people Steven Moffat's alienated.", "id": "dayr63s"}, {"comment": "> Moffat brought in a LOT of darkness, more inter-personal conflicts, more realism.\n\nAnd almost every episode had to have cameos from past Doctors, just to remind that Matt Smith is THE SAME GUY OMG HE'S LIKE THE SAME GUY AS ALL THE OTHERS.\n\nWhen you got the smallest, tiniest reference to past Doctors in the RTD series, it was special and made fans longtime happy.

I think his scripts and production are more polished overall, but I agree with you on this. \n\nI'm trying to think of where the Doctor's previous faces were references in RTD, and all that comes to mind is the regeneration episode where 10 was looking for new clothes. Past that, I think 9 and 10 were allowed to be their own Doctors without having other Doctors get in the way. Can't say that about 11 or 12.

There were definitely over references to old Doctors, such as the drawings in John Smith's book and of course \"Time Crash\".

I think it's hard to make the case that any of that \"got in the way\" of Smith making the role his own.\n\nCapaldi's era has much more, but it's not an overwhelming thing, there's a brief nod every half a dozen episodes. What was there in Series 9? A few clips of old Doctors speaking to Davros, single-frame shots of One and Four in Missy's imagination, and then the photographs in \"The Husbands of River Song\". Two of those were integral to the plot.\n\nCapaldi's portrayal is extremely popular in its own right, so I don't think there's much of a case to be made that him occasionally offering someone a jelly baby has stopped him making the role his own.", "id": "dazfinv"}, {"comment": "I prefer the Moffat era in general honestly but I have to say there is an energy to the RTD era that was lost and I wish that magic could be recaptured somehow.

On Broadchurch he came across as a guy who thought it was okay for him to treat people callously because of his dark past, which is appropriate for a noir story and it worked for Jessica's character, but since the show was really a drama about the ties that bind a community together and how their fear and judgment of each other threatens to tear them apart, and he wasn't even a member of the community, it just didn't work for me.\n\nIt's worth noting that I'm only talking about the first season of Broadchurch. In the second, his backstory played a much bigger role in the plot and they tried to give him a character arc. Unfortunately, I didn't like season two at all. After the harrowing ordeal that everyone went through that taught them the importance of trusting and caring for each other, none of the characters seemed to have learned anything and just continued to lie, keep secrets, and mistreat one another for arbitrary reasons.\n\nTennent's character in particular was still treating his partner like his servant but for some reason she was now going along with it instead of calling him out on it like she did before. He was supposed to have an arc about reconnecting with his family and finding closure with his past, but he kept making so many stupid mistakes and getting led on by people when he should've known better that I didn't care anymore.

And if you're not a big fan of any of them, or you just prefer Clara or Rory & Amy, that's fine. But I can't help pointing people to just how beautiful the Rose, Martha, Donna progression is. Yes, it's sad. Ten's time as the Doctor is plagued with a lot of sadness, the angsty Doctor. But one need only look at the three ladies of Ten's tenure to see why, and understand what they were to him.     \n\nRose fell in love with Nine, and Nine, with a new lease on life, regenerated into someone he could be because of Rose. Ten, for better or worse, is also defined very much by Rose. They are the love story. And Ten is forced to lose that love. Martha to some is an attempt to move on, but he needs her more in that moment more than ever. Without Rose, it's likely Ten would've taken to isolation. But Martha pushed him to continue to help and to serve, because that's all she'd been taught to do as well. She fell for him, and he was still reeling from Rose. It didn't work for some people, but I don't think Martha was ever victimized because of this. Rose grew because of the Doctor, Martha grew rather despite the Doctor. It's what makes Martha calling the Doctor in during the Sontaran invasion work. But it's also what kept her safe. If the Doctor fell in love with her too, he thought, he'd lose her. Not even fall in love with her, but he lost the people he got close to, so he kept Martha at a distance as much as he could. And love it or hate it, it worked. Martha remains one of the few companions who was able to walk away from the Doctor and the TARDIS.      \n\nWhich brings us to Donna. The Doctor wasn't oblivious to how Martha felt, which was all the more reason to him to keep her at arm's length. Following those two, he needed someone to pal around with, he needed someone who would be there, but have none of the emotional entanglements required of a relationship. Donna then, was perfect. She just wanted a chum, and they were best friends, larking about the universe, helping where they could. Donna also got Ten to lighten up, while also keeping him on track to remember what's important. Your mileage may vary on \"Fires of Pompeii\" but regardless of its quality, it teaches us something very important about the relationship of the Doctor and Donna: Donna can call out the Doctor when he's wrong. And he won't always listen, but he'll listen when it counts. And they have a good time, these two. Unburdened by love, somewhat redeemed in being able to let Martha go when he couldn't with Rose, the Doctor and Donna were a great team.      \n\nAnd that's what makes this good-bye so tragic. He couldn't hold on to Rose, he didn't know how to hold on to Martha, and now he knew he was going to lose Donna. The War Doctor lost everything in the last great Time War. Nine met a girl who taught him to appreciate life again, to love, and especially to love the \"little\" things. Ten had nothing and so loved three \"little\" people who were the whole world to him. Losing them made him sad, sure. But they also tried to teach him something. And he learned that not every decision works with every single person. From losing Rose, he learned to control his feelings, and so kept Martha closed off. From losing Martha, he made very clear his intentions with Donna. And from losing Donna, he learned that no matter what, he was going to lose people, because that's part of life, that's part of loving the little things. Those little things will mean the world, but they will leave us, whether we want them to or not.

This is why she begged him to not erase her memory...she'd rather die than go back to the life she had. But The Doctor did it anyways....\n\nI hope in the future The Doctor has no choice but to give her the memories back because the universe once again needs The Doctor Donna. She'd know she would die, but she knows the universe is more important and help The Doctor one last time.

And if you're not a big fan of any of them, or you just prefer Clara or Rory & Amy, that's fine. But I can't help pointing people to just how beautiful the Rose, Martha, Donna progression is. Yes, it's sad. Ten's time as the Doctor is plagued with a lot of sadness, the angsty Doctor. But one need only look at the three ladies of Ten's tenure to see why, and understand what they were to him.     \n\nRose fell in love with Nine, and Nine, with a new lease on life, regenerated into someone he could be because of Rose. Ten, for better or worse, is also defined very much by Rose. They are the love story. And Ten is forced to lose that love. Martha to some is an attempt to move on, but he needs her more in that moment more than ever. Without Rose, it's likely Ten would've taken to isolation. But Martha pushed him to continue to help and to serve, because that's all she'd been taught to do as well. She fell for him, and he was still reeling from Rose. It didn't work for some people, but I don't think Martha was ever victimized because of this. Rose grew because of the Doctor, Martha grew rather despite the Doctor. It's what makes Martha calling the Doctor in during the Sontaran invasion work. But it's also what kept her safe. If the Doctor fell in love with her too, he thought, he'd lose her. Not even fall in love with her, but he lost the people he got close to, so he kept Martha at a distance as much as he could. And love it or hate it, it worked. Martha remains one of the few companions who was able to walk away from the Doctor and the TARDIS.      \n\nWhich brings us to Donna. The Doctor wasn't oblivious to how Martha felt, which was all the more reason to him to keep her at arm's length. Following those two, he needed someone to pal around with, he needed someone who would be there, but have none of the emotional entanglements required of a relationship. Donna then, was perfect. She just wanted a chum, and they were best friends, larking about the universe, helping where they could. Donna also got Ten to lighten up, while also keeping him on track to remember what's important. Your mileage may vary on \"Fires of Pompeii\" but regardless of its quality, it teaches us something very important about the relationship of the Doctor and Donna: Donna can call out the Doctor when he's wrong. And he won't always listen, but he'll listen when it counts. And they have a good time, these two. Unburdened by love, somewhat redeemed in being able to let Martha go when he couldn't with Rose, the Doctor and Donna were a great team.      \n\nAnd that's what makes this good-bye so tragic. He couldn't hold on to Rose, he didn't know how to hold on to Martha, and now he knew he was going to lose Donna. The War Doctor lost everything in the last great Time War. Nine met a girl who taught him to appreciate life again, to love, and especially to love the \"little\" things. Ten had nothing and so loved three \"little\" people who were the whole world to him. Losing them made him sad, sure. But they also tried to teach him something. And he learned that not every decision works with every single person. From losing Rose, he learned to control his feelings, and so kept Martha closed off. From losing Martha, he made very clear his intentions with Donna. And from losing Donna, he learned that no matter what, he was going to lose people, because that's part of life, that's part of loving the little things. Those little things will mean the world, but they will leave us, whether we want them to or not.

There's the obvious connections, like Eleven meeting Amy as a girl and asking her to fly away with him, Eleven eventually becomes involved with Amy's daughter, Melody. But the psychology at play here is what's most interesting to me. Some people don't like Amy, but I think a lot of those people, if they really think about it, don't sit well with Amy and Eleven's relationship, not Amy herself (although some still don't like her, that's fine). Their relationship is childlike, immature. But it's Eleven withholding information from her, making decisions for her, and leaving her out of things a lot. He treats her like the child, like the child he first saw. In his mind, she never grows up. So obviously, this causes a lot of problems, because Amy is very devoted to the Doctor, and considers them friends. But what they say and what they do, particularly on the Doctor's end, are very different things.      \n\nI do think Eleven is attempting to take care of Amy and Rory but to do it entirely himself. He doesn't want to involve them, or tell them everything, perhaps even lies to them. It's again a very childlike, \"invincible youth\" way of thinking about things. Eleven is a direct result of Ten. Ten screams, \"I could do so much more!\" so he regenerates even younger, and with an even crazier, active mind to do everything. I want to believe that Eleven does care about Amy and Rory the way he says he does (sometimes I'm not so sure, but that's a separate discussion) but he lacks the maturity to always express it properly, at least in this incarnation. He's very good at being boisterous, and bragging about himself (again, very Pan-like, and we know Eleven has many of the best speeches in the show)  but he also does deliver more often than not. Amy functions as someone that the Doctor can protect. But that's only as \"Amelia\", as the little girl he left behind. As Amy Pond, the Doctor has to learn about how people change and grow and how that affects and changes the relationship. It's the Doctor re-learning how to let go, how to see his companions as equals. He is, in many ways, the father figure of the family of companions. Even if his companions are older, he is the Time Lord, he knows the universe. But he has no control over the woman that little girl becomes.       \n\nAnd speaking of equals, it's what makes Rory one of my favorites. Rory is everything the Doctor isn't, or at least not yet. Rory is devoted, and may come off sometimes as lap-doggy, but he's not. And he's a very important lesson for Eleven: he teaches him to wait. He waits, in real time, for 2000 years, to protect Amy at the Pandorica, as the Last Centurion. Eleven skips about all through his tenure, missing years at a time, all the while saying he's protecting them. Rory actually does it. He waits and protects. Eleven loses them because he continues to keep running. And he learns that you can't run from everything. He has to stand for something. Where is Eleven's last stand? Trenzalore, for 900 years against the Siege. He protects a small settlement there, because he failed to protect two people he claimed to love the most. The tragic characteristic of the Doctor, is that for all his harnessing of infinity and the potential he has controlling time, he often learns his lessons too late.     \n\nAs for Clara, the Impossible Girl, there isn't a whole lot I actually enjoy about Eleven and Clara. They're much more on equal footing, almost flirty again, and it feels like our Peter Pan Doctor has grown into a teenager and is playing the beats of his first awkward romance. Your mileage may vary on the Impossible Girl mystery, and just how intertwined Clara is to the Doctor, but I think she's a fantastic character and companion. They progress through this awkward romance to Eleven's regeneration into Twelve. Twelve, like Eleven before him, is a direct result of his previous incarnations. Ten had many regrets, and threw morals to the wind (\"Family of Blood,\" \"Water of Mars\"), Eleven ran and became what he most feared (\"A Good Man Goes To War\") Twelve constantly asks himself and Clara \"Am I a good man?\" This is an important rediscovery for the Doctor. It also seems like it's only Clara who can answer that. Amy and Rory, and to an extent, Melody/River have limitless devotion to the man, despite his failings. Clara can manage objectivity. In that way, the Impossible Girl, who can see the Doctor as a single entity, instead of just his current incarnation, knows the truth. And it's why they as soulmates are such a good team. Their relationship has progressed beyond the awkward teen romance. They are now soulmates. They make each other better, they push each other to their limits. It's also why they realize that they can be destructive for each other. That's why the companionship ends, because they went too far. The lesson Clara teaches Twelve is not, \"what is a good man?\" it's \"how far can goodness go?\"      \n\nTo bring it all home, I love Clara (the soulmate, the partner), Amy (the devoted, the motivator), Rory (the ideal, the loyalist), and River (the true love, the empowerer). But there was something so perfectly encapsulated within Ten and his three companions' journey. I think the stories for Eleven and Twelve just got bigger, so there's more to discuss!   \n\n...

", "id": "d7ej5ky"}, {"comment": "Actually, that's interesting, because I initially didn't like Clara all that much because I'm not a huge fan of Eleven as a character. So I definitely think the Doctor and his companions and how we like one or the other can affect how we feel about the remaining party. Don't get me wrong, Matt Smith is great and I love him and I think he's a marvelous actor. But the way Eleven deals with things and acts as a character is so self-important and so grating. Not an enjoyable incarnation for me in a lot of episodes.      \n\nIt's why I love Clara and Twelve, because Twelve is actively trying to atone for his mistakes, and not just his but Nine, Ten, and Eleven. And Clara is the one who can push him to do that. She's similar to Donna in a lot of ways, in that she can call him out when he's being an ass.

Eleven was actually the doctor that got me to sit down and watch Who. I'd seen a couple random episodes from Nine and Ten, but nothing really hooked me until I caught a BBC marathon leading up to Rory and Amy's last episode. Amy was and is probably my favorite standalone character, despite her numerous flaws (I think that's why I like her so much, she's very three-dimensional IMO). So after she left I was not very open to the introduction of another companion, and I HATED Clara before I even got to know her as a character. I also was expecting her to be Souffl\u00e9 Girl and was a little disappointed that she both was and was not. Honestly I could rant for a while about how much I disliked the introduction and explanation of her character, but I digress. So then Eleven regenerates into Twelve, and I say goodbye to my first Doctor. I love Peter Capaldi, but adamantly dislike Twelve. Now that I've read your comment and thought on it some, I have to wonder if my dislike for him is genuine or if it's the result of a new doctor and new(ish) companion, and in reality I just dislike change? \n\nI know this didn't really go anywhere, but you kind of gave me an epiphany.

I had a similar epiphany, because a lot of my friends, especially since Matt Smith, have \"their\" Doctor. Everyone has \"their\" Doctor, but I kind of realized that I don't have a particular ownership to one because when I started watching Who, it was literally introduced to me as \"the show where the main guy keeps changing!\" so I think it ingrained in me to not get too attached, just appreciate them for their time. Nine is my favorite of the new series, thought Twelve is starting to get there, especially in those last few episodes last season. But I also adore Ten. And Eleven has his moments for me. But I was given VHS tapes of Seven, and when I FIRST saw it, I was watching Three and Four. So I can see where people have that connection. That's \"their\" Doctor, and it's how they meet The Doctor. I love that, even if I don't really have it myself.      \n\nI liked Clara a lot more this time around as I rewatched everything from the start of the modern series.

They were pals, and they knew that from the start.

Related to the above point, just a mate is exactly the sort of person who could do that.\n\n- Rose was bored, Martha was looking for something different, but Donna really was in a rut. Even her friends and family didn't have her back. The Doctor helped Donna stand on her own two feet, even if only to cruelly take it away (necessarily, though).\n\n- Wilf! His impact as a character comes from loving Donna, being the only one to never give up on a character who has already given up on herself. That dynamic is super important; without Donna to self-loathe and her mother to heap more scorn on, Wilf's impact as a character, let alone companion, would be severely reduced.\n\n- Lastly, my favourite things about Donna are her \"unattractive\"ness (as you so kindly put it) and \"annoying\"ness. To me, these made her the most \"human\" of the companions; not just attractive \"HELP ME DOCTOR\" speakerboxes on legs, but a person whose insecurities and flaws manifest in her behaviour.
