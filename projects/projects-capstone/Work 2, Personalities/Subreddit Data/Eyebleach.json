Like, I have an uncle, who's dog walked from mid-east Saskatchewan to upper-west Alberta when he was unable to take it with him when he moved.\n\nAnyway, my most recent pet cat (who sadly passed last year) could not resist following me to high school when I was attending or when I entered stores in my home town. It was a very small town, so everyone knew my cat was persistent in following me, since he'd normally wait outside whatever building I was in and slip in when the next customer entered. He was house trained and fixed so him having accident/spraying inside was never a problem. He was very friendly cat as well and very tolerant around children. So, anyway, if he hadn't already found me in wherever I was, I'd usually get a call on my cell or over the PA that my cat was wandering around. Which, I'd pick him up (after leaving what I was doing) and return him home.\n\nThough that's minor compared to my grandmother who had a piglet and a one legged chicken that she would have with her wherever she went as a kid. The pig was her father's solution when she asked for a puppy (it eventually was killed for food one year), and the chicken was attacked by a fox, losing it's leg and she was afraid it was going to be killed if left alone again in the hen house.\n\nThe only person who might have one upped her on odd pets following/being constantly around them. Was an uncle that wanted to have horses. Unfortunately the town put a bylaw banning large farm animals, so he instead got 246 rabbits... Resulting in the town making another bylaw banning more than 5 or so animals being owned by one person.\n\nWell, I do have cousins that raise guinea pigs, hamsters, pigeons, lizards, and snakes, but they stay in their cages, except Iggy the Iguana who would ride on my aunt's shoulders sometimes.\n\nIn short, my family is weird and we take our animals everywhere even if we don't want to...\n\n~~Sorry for boring anyone!~~"], [4, "I worked at a staples for a few years, and a bestbuy for a few months (both stores have carpeted floors) Customers would bring their cute little animals in all the time, only to have them shit or piss on the floor.

It was a very small town, so everyone knew my cat was persistent in following me, since he'd normally wait outside whatever building I was in and slip in when the next customer entered. He was house trained and fixed so him having accident/spraying inside was never a problem. He was very friendly cat as well and very tolerant around children. So, anyway, if he hadn't already found me in wherever I was, I'd usually get a call on my cell or over the PA that my cat was wandering around. Which, I'd pick him up (after leaving what I was doing) and return him home.\n\nThough that's minor compared to my grandmother who had a piglet and a one legged chicken that she would have with her wherever she went as a kid. The pig was her father's solution when she asked for a puppy (it eventually was killed for food one year), and the chicken was attacked by a fox, losing it's leg and she was afraid it was going to be killed if left alone again in the hen house.\n\nThe only person who might have one upped her on odd pets following/being constantly around them. Was an uncle that wanted to have horses. Unfortunately the town put a bylaw banning large farm animals, so he instead got 246 rabbits... Resulting in the town making another bylaw banning more than 5 or so animals being owned by one person.\n\nWell, I do have cousins that raise guinea pigs, hamsters, pigeons, lizards, and snakes, but they stay in their cages, except Iggy the Iguana who would ride on my aunt's shoulders sometimes.\n\nIn short, my family is weird and we take our animals everywhere even if we don't want to...\n\n~~Sorry for boring anyone!~~", "id": "d7ob6w6"}], [{"comment": "I worked at a staples for a few years, and a bestbuy for a few months (both stores have carpeted floors) Customers would bring their cute little animals in all the time, only to have them shit or piss on the floor.

The problem here is that most of the people who deliberately cross-breed dogs are breeding out of either ignorance (of the fact that the world just does not need more different breeds of dogs and the fact that it takes decades and sometimes over a century of dedicated breeding to develop an actual breed) or greed (they simply want the money they can bilk people out of for \"designer puppies\".  Because of this, they don't bother to health test or research pedigrees, so the puppies they produce stand to exhibit the worst traits of the breeds that comprise them instead of the best.  \n\nAs far as the parents not being related, if both parents carry the markers for a particular genetic problem, the puppies stand just as much of a chance of presenting with that problem as they would if their parents were of the same breed.  Humans are, hopefully, not closely related when they marry but if there is heart disease on both sides of the family, the kids will likely develop it at some point in their lives, at least to one degree or another.

In short, if two different individual dogs have the same potential for a health problem, it doesn't matter how genetically diverse they are. Genetic diversity only raises the general \"odds\" of less health problems. \n\n\nPurebreds are less diverse, but have potential to be healthy due to genetic testing and careful awareness of each parent's history. \n\n\nHealthy purebreds are well protected by the breeder, and are only allowed to breed with other healthy individuals of the breed. The only time they're bred to other breeds is when outcrossing to create more genetic diversity. \n\n\nIf you mix two unhealthy purebreds (virtually every designer breeder does this, because healthy purebreds are only bred to other purebreds for reasons below), it will very likely produce unhealthy puppies. A well structured mutt will probably have fewer health problems than a designer dog. Most purebred from a good breeder will also have fewer health problems than a designer breed. A healthy purebred and well structured mutt will be a tossup. \n\n\nAlso, the whole point of breeding dogs is to create puppies with predictability. Physical features, temperment, and health predictability. If you don't have **each** of those factors as ideal and predictable, there is no point in breeding the dogs. \n\n\nThe produced dogs' features (i.e. all designer dogs) would be found in thousands of shelter dogs and it would be unethical to create them. I've seen many, many dogs that look like \"cavapoos\" or \"cockapoos\" or \"golden/labradoodles\" in shelters. They look pretty much exactly like the pictures. There are SO many cute poodle mutts in shelters, yet people constantly go to designer breeders. \n\n\nOn the other hand, there are little to no purebreds in any shelter who had health tested parents, proper rearing, healthy structure, etc. for multiple reasons. \n\n\nSo...

The dog ends up with organs that are ill-suited to either body type. Another unfavorable mix is hyperbrachycephalic dogs with hyperdolichocephalic dogs. This can often lead to congenital defects of the nasal passages. There are many different mixtures that can be harmful.

Always praise and treat. Eventually he will start to ring it to go out.\n\n2. Run on the treadmill: Teach by having him first stand on the treadmill next to you (reward with a small treat morsel) then slowly walk next to you (reward with praise and treat). One of my dogs took a few hours (in very small increments of training time; remember how short puppies' attentions spans are) and the other one, a rescue, literally saw his new brother running on it and got jealous and jumped on, too!\n\n3. Automatic sit: Teach him to automatically sit whenever you are giving him something or having him wait for an instruction. My 6 yr old schnauzer mix still does this and it's an easy train. With treats in your hand that they can smell, walk around the house (alternate slow and fast, but remember only train for small increments of time so they don't get bored) and then just randomly stop; hold the treat down low over there head so they're forced to sit to see it. Praise and treat when they sit. Just spend around 10 minutes per day doing this and it'll be learned quickly. \n\nFYI: I am not a dog trainer and my dog isn't well trained re anything else but these 3 things.

Dogs are smart and know little people need gentleness. However don't let that keep you from paying very close attention. All of my K9s play with toddlers 2 and older very frequently, and these are dogs that when they see a speck of dust floating in front of them they chomp so hard you can hear the next room over their drive is so on point. A toddler waving a tug around, driving these dogs absolutely crazy will still get them to gentlely approach her and take the tug. If they go over the line, your scolding will teach them that's not ok. Eventually the dog will just know. \n\nIf you have a dog that is sensitive to corrections, it means it's not confident. Make sure you have a happy dog, play with it, challenge it, reward it like crazy when it overcomes challenges, build ball drive and throw in obedience into it. Eventually the dog will be more focused on it's drive than fearing correction. The drive should be so high corrections should only tell the dog \"ok, let's forget about the ball for a second.. whatever just happened wasn't me getting the ball. Why?\" \n\nIf the dog jumps on someone, make a very loud NO! Make a huge fuss about it, pull the dog away, put it in a crate or lock it in the bathroom for a while.

There are good youtube videos out there that are both negative re-enforcement and positive re-enforcement.\n\nTypically this is how it breaks down. \n\nTake your dog on a leash, open the front door. DO NOT allow the dog to run out or pull you out. You make that bastard sit, when he's sat for at least 3-5 seconds. Then take ONE step. The dog will see this and think \"YES! I CAN GO!!!!\" and he's gonna likely want to bolt. Don't. The second he tugs or gets wreckless, stop, pull, make him sit. If you're doing this right, it'll take you 15-20minutes to go a block. Keep repeating until the dog gets it. Eventually you can start doing a low warning hum when your dog starts pulling and they'll come back. If your dog is extra stubborn and not using negative enforcement is providing too slow progress or your dog just isn't getting it. Get an appropriately sized prong collar (not a thick one, you're aiming for the tinest gauge prong they make for your dogs neck size) and GENTLY use it. This is NOT supposed to cause pain to the dog unless it is wrecklessly disobedient. If it's being a butt-head, again a gentle quick tug as a negative reward for his bad behavior and once he calms down, proceed. If he keeps acting up, slowly pull back and upwards until the dog stops, and if he keeps losing his shit do it again. \n\n\nAlways remember to end EVERY training session on a good note. Never give up on training one day because your dog is having a bad obedience day. That will teach him acting bad gets him out of this hard work. \n\nIf you are working your dog and you can tell he's just not all there, or he's a little down, or somethings off.

Was holding an 11 ft reticulated python in high school many years ago when it pooped and peed on my at the same time. The poop is yellow. ", "id": "dahvhg8"}, {"comment": "Snakes and most other reptiles regulate water very strictly. Their skin is impermeable to water and they don't lose much to evaporation, as they have no sweat glands and don't pant or otherwise expose wet membranes to the air. Their respiratory system does a good job of humidifying air on the way in and dehumidifying it on the way out (fyi, this is one reason why sinuses are so convoluted: they exchange moisture on inhale/exhale. Certain desert-adapted mammals like camels have very very efficient exchange of water and heat within their sinuses, preventing water loss). Likewise, reptile excretory systems are very efficient with water. They do this by concentrating their nitrogen waste. \n\nNitrogen waste is excreted as several different molecules depending upon the physiology and environment of the animal. Fish that live in fresh water have a problem: they have a higher concentration of solute (dissolved salts and other molecules) inside their bodies than outside and those concentrated solutes attract water into their bodies through the very thin layers of cells in their gills that separate blood from water. Therefore, they must excrete a lot of water and hold onto solutes; fortunately, that means they have the luxury of disposing of their nitrogenous waste as the unconcentrated solute NH4, aka ammonia (which is the natural state of all nitrogenous waste). Ammonia is toxic but it doesn't take any extra energy to concentrate, making it a cheap waste product. Freshwater fish are urinating pretty much constantly to keep ammonia from building up.\n\nLand animals, on the other hand, have to hold onto water because they only get it when they eat or drink. They hold onto their nitrogenous waste for a while, building it up before they excrete it with precious water. Because ammonia is toxic, they have to concentrate their nitrogenous waste into something less toxic and also pack solute more tightly so they have to waste less water during excretion. That concentrated nitrogenous waste falls into two categories: urea and uric acid. Urea's formula CH4**N2**O shows that it contains two nitrogens, thus making twice as concentrated than ammonia, and uric acid is 4x concentrated a formula of C5H4**N4**O3. Both cost energy to produce from ammonia, and uric acid is more energy-expensive than urea to produce. Urea is still somewhat toxic but wastes much less water than ammonia, while uric acid wastes the least and is actually almost insoluble. Uric acid is the white stuff in bird droppings, you can see that it's really just a paste of crystallized solute in a tiny bit of water.\n\nGenerally, mammals, amphibians, marine fish, and turtles excrete urea and other reptiles and birds excrete uric acid. Marine fish, unlike freshwater fish, have to conserve water because there is far more solute outside of their bodies than inside, which constantly threatens to pull water out of their bodies. Therefore they excrete very little urine and concentrate their nitrogen. Amphibians and turtles live in or around fresh water, but as most amphibians do not breathe through gills (mostly lungs, some through their skin) and turtles all have lungs they are not under the same threat of constant dilution as freshwater fish, yet they have lots of access to water through drinking or immersion. Birds and reptiles, on the other hand, are survival specialists: they can thrive in some of the driest environments on earth and the excretion of uric acid is part of that capability. Another extreme survivor phylum, arthropoda (insects, arachnids, crustaceans) has evolved the ability to produce uric acid and many land-dwelling arthropods excrete it.\n\nIf mammals have an excess of urea in their system, generally from an extremely rich diet and/or kidney dysfunction, they can get uric acid crystallization in their joints which causes a painful condition called gout. Marine sharks have an interesting offshoot of urea handling that gives them added buoyancy in water. Vertebrate fish have air bladders that they use to adjust buoyancy, but Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes, including sharks and skates) don't. Instead, they use a couple of mechanisms to keep themselves afloat, including fat storage, constant swimming and a lift-providing body shape, and (pertinent to this subject) urea saturation: they produce a chemical called trimethylamine oxide that makes their bodies very tolerant to the toxicity of urea, so much so that they actually saturate all of their tissues with it because it is more buoyant than water. \n\nI <3 biology so much, bodies are cool and weird all at once.", "id": "daim4an"}, {"comment": "Some snakes need a lot more water than others, and the consistency of their urates can vary depending on how much water is available. \n\nWestern Hognosed like that little guy usually leave semi-dry messes behind.

Many dogs and their owners are completely tone-deaf when it comes to how other dogs and people react to their approach. A totally typical scenario:\n\n- Gigantic, goofy lab charges up to a small dog on the sidewalk, pulling its owner behind it. \n- Small dog stiffens, stops breathing and stares the approaching dog in the eye (meaning, \"don't get any closer.\")\n- Owner of small dog tries to intervene\n- Owner of big dog says, \"Don't worry, he's friendly!\"\n- Lab tramples and terrifies small dog\n- Small dog bares teeth and snarls\n- Lab responds in kind\n- Big dog owner: \"Whoa, your dog started that fight!\"\n\nor... \n\n- Lady buys new small dog from a breeder\n- friend comes over to meet dog\n- owner scoops up dog and holds it; friend leans over to kiss it\n- Pomeranian bites friend in the face. \n\nBoth are scenarios I have seen many times as a dog trainer.

Both are \"too large\" for the show rings. Weirdly though, their brains fit inside their skulls.\n\nWe feel the brain thing is far more important than the ring thing. :)\n\nFemale is spayed (never bred). Male is neutered (never bred).\n\nWe got the male from a responsible breeder as a pup. A couple of years ago we got the female from a family needing to rehome her - supposedly because the daughter was allergic to her.\n\nWe have the female on prozac because apparently in her last home - it was thought adorable and fun to \"play\" (tease) her with a lazer beam. She is so susceptible to shadows, sunbeams and reflections that she will run her face into walls (she actually has 2 missing teeth we suspect was caused by this). \n\nWe were told she didn't much like \"older\" men with beards. My husband is in his late 60's and has a beard. Guess who her favorite person is?\n\nWe just wonder what sort of treatment she received in her last home. Another thing we were told is that 3 or 4 times a week she had to spend 6 to 7 hours in a crate when no one was home.\n\nWhen we first get a puppy or new dog here we do start them off in a crate at night and when we must leave them to run errands. They will also get into an open crate just to take a nap on occasion. However, after we can trust they won't use the house as a bathroom or be destructive; we leave them in our home office with a baby gate at the door - with a full bowl of water and a couple of treats. That's what they now are able to do.\n\nResponsible breeding, TLC and common sense go a long way to having successful relationships with,  and healthy,  pets :)\n\n", "id": "d2m4n11"}, {"comment": "> We have the female on prozac because apparently in her last home - it was thought adorable and fun to \"play\" (tease) her with a lazer beam.\n\nThat's awful.

She has an awesome personality, I can take her everywhere. She's a pleasure to be around. \n\nWhat you describe how you crate your dogs seems to be far more reasonable than her previous owners. Where I live crating is usually unheard of. I first read about it on reddit I think.  ", "id": "d2mbwg8"}, {"comment": "Crating is a lifesaver and not at all abusive or \"mean\".\n\nIt actually can save a pet/human relationship long-term by preventing unwanted \"accidents\" (bathroom or destruction). It also gives them a safe, cozy \"den\" to nap in and to just hang out if they want quiet time.\n\nWith a new puppy - we always are here to take them out every hour on the hour for a pee or poo. With puppies it usually takes about 5 minutes. Obviously at night the schedule is different - we crate them and take them out every 4 hours. If there happens to be an accident we completely ignore it - one of us cleans up and the other takes the pup out for relief.\nHonestly - no lie - usually within a week - they are \"trained\" to go outside. Once that issue is cleared up, we use the crate when we leave the house - Usually no more than 4 hours at a time and that's rare for us to be gone from home with a puppy there. We do that for about 6 months or so until we are certain \"chewing\" or other destructive behavior aren't manifesting themselves.\n\nOver several decades and many pets - we have lost one shoe, one towel, one hankerchief, a small patch of a rug and a tiny piece of upholstery from the bottom of the couch. Nothing that serious in the least.\n\nUntil they are about one year old we will leave a crate out with the door open so they can just use it as they see fit. After a year, we put it away and rely on a baby gate at the door of our home office when we leave for errands, or an evening out. Never any issues with that whatsoever either.\n\nCrates  really are a terrific training tool if not abused :)\n\nYour \"little\" one sounds purely adorable. When I was growing up there was a Chihuahua breeder who lived several houses from us.\n\nOMG they were just so adorable! In the spring there would be one or two litters - they were always healthy with shiny coats and wagging tails and smiles! I loved to sit by the fence and pet them!\n\nThe breeder was into breeding for show and her pups were very expensive which explains why my parents never got one lol Thankfully the breeder was happy to have me \"socialize\" them ! :)", "id": "d2moboc"}, {"comment": "I'm confused by your brain statement, do you mean eyes?

Their respiratory system is so compromised that some Bulldogs can't even run without gasping for breath. Many struggle to breathe in hot or humid weather. In the summer, English Bulldogs should be kept in an air conditioned home and supervised during outside activity so they don't overexert themselves and suffer heatstroke.\nVirtually all Bulldog puppies are born by C-section, birth defects are common, and the puppy mortality rate is high.\nEnglish Bulldogs are also deformed orthopedically \u2013 their abnormal build is a structural defect called chondrodysplasia, which predisposes them to bone and joint problems. Hip dysplasia is rampant. According to the Orthopedic Foundation of America, the English Bulldog has the highest incidence of hip dysplasia of all breeds \u2013 an incredible 74% are dysplastic. And the true rate is even higher because most of the obviously bad X-rays were not sent in for official evaluation. Elbow dysplasia is almost as bad, with 40% dysplastic. Luxating patella (loose knees) is also common, and luxating shoulder can occur, as well.\nOther orthopedic diseases in Bulldogs include intervertebral disk disease, cruciate ligament rupture, and hemivertebra.\nHypothyroidism is becoming more common in the breed. According to the Michigan State University Thyroid Database, up to 11% of English Bulldogs have low thyroid levels.\nHeart disease (especially pulmonic stenosis, but also septal defect, subaortic stenosis, and mitral valve disease) is a serious problem in English Bulldogs.\nBulldogs are prone to allergies that cause itchy skin, and their wrinkled folds of skin trap dirt and moisture and provide a home for yeast and bacteria, so bacterial skin infections (pyoderma) are common. Specific forms of pyoderma occurring in English Bulldogs include skin fold dermatitis, interdigital pyoderma, and chin folliculitis.\nDemodectic mange is common in English Bulldog puppies and adolescents.\nTumors and cancers are very common in Bulldogs, especially mast cell tumors and perianal gland tumors.\nLots of eye problems occur in English Bulldogs, especially corneal ulcers, cherry eye, dry eye, eyelid abnormalities (entropion and ectropion), eyelash abnormalities, and persistent pupillary membranes. You may see cataracts at 1-2 years old.\nUrinary problems include cystinuria and kidney disease, as well as various physical malformations of the urethra and vagina.\nSome English Bulldogs experience head tremors that may be due to abnormalities of the brain.\nOther health issues in English Bulldogs include bloat, blood-clotting disease (von Willebrand's), laryngeal paralysis, megaesophagus, pyloric stenosis, hydrocephalus, and inherited deafness in Bulldog puppies with a lot of white on their head.\n\n \n\n", "id": "d54md0b"}, {"comment": "Bulldogs can't be posted on reddit without people posting about how terrible their lives are.

I certainly am no expert on the matter of psychological health but I 've been through a lot and I know things should be looked after as early as possible.\n\nEffectiveness is of less concern when it comes to drugs. Toxicity has to be checked or people will die. You first test on animals that feel less or no pain, or animals that are as close to a human. The bioethics committees state that you have to use as few animals as possible, cause them as less discomfort (whatever that includes) as possible and not use them at all if it is not completely necessary. The thing is, it's very often necessary. Reasons you can't test on people is of course the fact that they 're humans and the fact that humans don't live in a box all day. They do stuff, or you don't know their family's gene/disease history. With animals you know and you can control them in order to avoid other factors of lifestyle changing the outcome of the study. Scientists don't use animals because they like to \"torture\" them but to save the life of someone, someone's kid, someone's mother from autoimmune diseases to cancer, to Zika, to anything really. Some things have to be done and it might be unfortunate and cold but you have to break eggs to make an omelette.\n\nYou know what's truly inhuman, cosmetics being tested on animals. The fur industry.

Wolf 'Hybrid' is often the most mis-reported data in the world, and while you're right that there are very few actual wolfdogs compared to something like a pitbull, there are a lot of huskies and other arctic breeds that are often mistaken and labeled as a wolfdog by the owner because the owner is undereducated.\n\nYou said that wolfdogs have caused the 4th most human fatalities of any other breed - this isn't true, but it fits what people expect out of the narrative. Your source lists 19 deaths attributed to wolfdogs in the past 31 years while in the same time frame pitbulls have been responsible for 263 deaths and huskies, a breed commonly mistaken for a wolfdog, have been responsible for 25 deaths.

If it's wrong, feel free to provide information to the contrary.\n\n>Your source lists 19 deaths attributed to wolfdogs in the past 31 years\n\nEven that is incredibly generous, seeing as for decades wolves were extinct in the lower 48 states until 1995. Unlike Rottweilers, huskies, etc., there hasn't been a boom in wolfdog ownership in America until quite recently.\n\n> If wolf content creates a more dangerous breed it would stand to reason that wolfdogs would bite more often than one of the most common base breeds of the mix.\n\nAgain, you're ignoring population numbers.

There VERY few wolf dogs around that don't live in sanctuaries so of course there are substantially fewer bites. Otherwise I completely agree with some of what you're saying though I disagree with other parts. \n\nSome thoughts I've shared about wolf dogs before: A wolf dog is in no way comparable to a pitbull other than they are usually owned by irresponsible people who are not prepared to give the animal the life and training it needs. A wolf dog is not a dog or a wolf. It's a wild animal that is part dog and can never, ever be fully trusted because a huge part of its genetic and psychological make up is made from a wild, untamed animal that is terrified of humans and wants to kill other animals. Any responsible wolf dog owner will be the first to tell you that they are not dogs and should never, ever be trusted the way you can trust a dog.\n\nI'm a big proponent of responsible breed advocacy which is why I suggest the average person does not adopt certain breeds of dogs unless they are fully prepared to address all of the pros and cons of the dog's breed behaviors. I can't imagine anyone ever should own a wolf dog.\n\nWolves are wild animals and belong in the wild. I can see the benefit of owning them in a sanctuary setting as necessary but there is no responsible way to purchase and own a wolf dog. I would even go so far to say that it's better for them to euthanized if found at shelters rather than risk falling into the hands of someone who thinks they're some kind of dog whisperer and the animal gets out and kills someone or someone's pets or livestock. \n\nAlso as far as responsible breed advocacy goes, don't try to compare small dog bites to large dog bites. That doesn't do any dogs any favors and doesn't help defend larger dogs at all, if anything it makes arguments defending those dogs weaker because it's such a bad comparison. The chances that a 10lb Jack Russell can maim or kill someone is extremely unlikely compared to larger terriers like pit bulls. I'm actually in favor of TEMPORARY breed bans because pitbulls are WAY too popular right now. Terriers are not the easiest dogs to train so you take that and put it into the highly athletic, strong, and intelligent pit bull and it's just not a beginner's dog. A lot of people adopt pit bulls for the wrong reasons. All terriers are more working dogs than pets but the pitbull especially is better for an active family that can put their dog to work. They are awesome dogs but way too many people adopt or buy these dogs and then don't give them the training, socialization, and enrichment they need to be well adjusted dogs that are not aggressive towards strangers and other animals. ", "id": "da6upns"}, {"comment": "Just want to point out that aggression toward other animals is no reason to ban a breed or euthanize a dog. Keep the dog on a leash and it won't have a chance to harm another pet. Simple as that. Dogs are animals and as such have certain tendencies that can be broken with time but cannot always be trusted 100% with some dogs. That dog might be a pitbull, it might be a Jack Russel. The Jack Russel won't kill another dog probably but it can still do a lot of damage. In either case these animals have natural tendencies that can cause them to have aggression toward other animals, but it's completely controllable if you're not a dumbass.", "id": "da6zkym"}, {"comment": "The dogs aggression is not why it should euthanized. It's the dumbasses who adopt these dogs that need extra training that are causing the issues. People think \"oh all dogs are the saaaaame I am such a good person and racism is baaaaaad\" but dogs are not people and choosing not to adopt a dog because it's breed traits are more advanced than your current level of dog ownership skills is the responsible thing to do, not racist. Pit bulls are awesome dogs and I'm sure wolf dogs are excellent creatures but there are people who are more suited to owning golden retrievers or beagles.\n\nHowever since no one can apparently be expected to behave responsibly and shelters are more interested in churning out adoptions than advising people about responsible ownership, pitbulls end up in the wrong hands.

They can also be bred with pure-white or mostly-black coats, making their physical appearance even more striking.  \n\nThese dogs have several heat-conserving measures, usually including double-layered coats and extra fatty tissue for insulation. They are *not* suitable for warm or hot climates, but their physical appearance makes them highly sought-after regardless of the location. \n\nHuskies are cool dogs, but range from neurotic and needy to extremely laid back. They are stubborn and extremely energetic due to their history as sled dogs. A common trait is pulling on the leash - If this occurs, do not attempt to pull on the leash to keep them from doing the same - Huskies are sled dogs, and moving a sled means they're quite familiar with feeling a pull.

It's just light impinging on their retinas. \n\nVideo is a series of still images that your brain knits together in to the illusion of motion. The human brain requires ~20 frames per second to perceive this as fluid motion, but for dogs it's more like 70. Older TVs had a much lower refresh rate, so rather than realistic motion, dogs saw a bunch of still images, which aren't compelling. With modern TVs the frame rate has increased, so dogs are able to interpret video much as we do. ", "id": "d5l3ipc"}, {"comment": "It has more to do with interlacing versus progressive scanning.\n\nhttp://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/interlaced-vs-progressive-scanning-methods.html\n\n", "id": "d5l4kb3"}, {"comment": "I think it's much more to do with image retention. LCD screens retain the last frame drawn in between refreshes, so there's less perceived flickering (only the refresh rate of the source material matters), and it's probably easier (conjecture) for a dog to perceive motion on these screens. Due to LCD panel's higher response times, images also gradually fade into each other, as opposed to switching instantaneously, which extenuates motion blur and also can help with the perception of motion (although for humans, the blur is annoying). Many LCD TVs also have motion tweening tech in them that generates intermediate frames for low frame rate source material, which would definitely help maintain the perception of motion (it even helps in humans, although it causes some minor artefacts and leads to the [soap opera effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_interpolation#Soap_opera_effect)).\n\n\nOn the other hand, CRT and Plasma displays have such tiny response times that most of the time the screen is actually black, and a bright new image is scanned across it at a rapid rate (which is why they often look strange on camera). I imagine this could affect the perception of motion when viewed through eyes that have shorter image retention too - the dog might not actually see a complete frame, but rather a rapidly scanning line or strobing effect. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2czqYV3T_Kc) that /u/bluesatin [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/4twr8t/they_started_a_howl/d5l3o4h).\n\nOLED TVs fall somewhere in between these two, depending on the display - some displays scan like CRT/Plasma, some can hold their state in between scans with a persistent buffer, some can globally refresh, and some can hold the frame for any amount of time desired and blank to black in between (such as the screens used in VR headsets).\n\nI really want to get a bunch of dogs now and put them in front of a bunch of TVs and see what happens.", "id": "d5l6fm8"}, {"comment": ".... what?", "id": "d5l3mz4"}, {"comment": "That would mean they couldn't see a wall in front of them.

You said a \"pupper is a doggo.\"\n\nIs it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.\n\nAs someone who is a scientist who studies puppers, doggos, yappers, and even woofers, I am telling you, specifically, in doggology, no one calls puppers doggos. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"doggo family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous, which includes things from sub woofers to birdos to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind).\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a pupper a doggo is because random people \"call the small yip yip ones doggos?\" Let's get penguos and turkos in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A pupper is a pupper and a member of the doggo family. But that's not what you said. You said a pupper is a doggo, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the doggo family doggos, which means you'd call piggos, sluggos, and other species doggos, too. Which you said you don't.\n\nIt's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?\n\nEdit: It's a [copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/4tz0ky/heres_the_thing_you_said_a_pupper_is_a_doggo/), but you're free to downvote me for it.", "id": "d5mg2ol"}, {"comment": "What?

It's an escape character that generally tells the compiler to ignore the next character if you are using another character that is reserved to have a specific function \n\ne.g. if you had a string like:\n\n    print \"Please strike the \"return\" key to continue\"\n\nthe compiler is going to assume that the quotes before return are to close the first string, and the quotes after are to open a second string, which in most languages would cause a syntax error for three reasons:\n\n* most likely return is not defined as a variable, or in languages like php since it does not have a `$` before it, it would believe that it is a constant which would also most likely not be defined. (however in the case of our string \"return\" is often a reserved word in programming languages, so the compiler would throw one of two errors depending on the programing language:\n\nA. It would throw an error because you are not creating a function and there is nothing to return\n\nB. depending on what type of language you are using it might throw and error that there is an unexpected `return` function, and that it expected a instruction separation.\n\n* There is nothing in between the two strings (and our undefined variable/constant) to concatenate them, so the compiler would not know what to do with the rest of the junk after the first string\n\n* If this were in a function in some languages and that language happened to be whitespace based AND it does not need spaces in between its code it may prematurely return the function and pass the wrong value back to the parent with could cause even wider problems in the program, although function rarely return a string and it more likely that they return a Integer, Float, or Boolean, in which case the compiler would throw an error that it cannot change the string to the other respective types of variables.\n\n\nTo avoid complications like this programing language have a couple ways around this:\n\n1. is the `\\` which tells the compiler to ignore the next character in the case of out string it would be the quotation marks so the string would be written like `print \"please strike the \\\"return\\\" key to continue\"`\n\n2. is ASCII escape codes rather than the character itself like HTML instead of using a quotation mark instead you can use `&quot;` or in a langue like python `u\"\\u0022\"` so if we were writing out code in python we would write `print \"please strike the u\"\\u0022\"returnu\"\\u0022\" key to continue\"`\n\n3. is in some languages for strings ' and \" are interchange able and we would write our string as `print 'please strike the \"return\" key to continue'`\n\n\nAdditionally the `\\` is used in the reverse in situations where something like `\\n`, `\\t`, or `\\r` are used inwhich it tells the compiler that it needs to move the cursor, so `\\n` moves the cursor to a new line `\\t` is tab space, `\\r` is the return carriage which is rarely used except in command line environments.", "id": "d4oz1uy"}, {"comment": "Known as an 'escape character'!

Note how the dog nervously looks at the vet before he starts eating from the bowl, and averts its eyes when the vet looks at him. The vet being right next to the dog and even using his hand to feed the dog is in fact exposing the dog to high levels of fearful stimuli that invoke fearful responses from the dog\n\nFrom what I understand, it's more productive to begin this training with sub-threshold levels of stimuli that don't invoke fearful responses, like having the vet across the room, not making eye contact, etc, and slowly ramp it up. Specifically, this technique of starting with less intensity, and more importantly, no fear responses, is called \"systematic desensitisation\". The technique in this video is essentially the opposite, starting with HIGH levels of stimuli and is known as \"Flooding\".\n\nFlooding is definitely not seen as an ideal technique for reducing fearful responses in dogges. The [AHS](https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/training/counter-conditioning-and-desensitization) and [PetMD](http://pets.webmd.com/desensitization-and-counterconditioning?page=2) have good write-ups detailing how to train using the systematic desensitisation and counter-conditioning techniques."], [37, "Mr. Healy if he was good at his job.

Note how the dog nervously looks at the vet before he starts eating from the bowl, and averts its eyes when the vet looks at him. The vet being right next to the dog and even using his hand to feed the dog is in fact exposing the dog to high levels of fearful stimuli that invoke fearful responses from the dog\n\nFrom what I understand, it's more productive to begin this training with sub-threshold levels of stimuli that don't invoke fearful responses, like having the vet across the room, not making eye contact, etc, and slowly ramp it up. Specifically, this technique of starting with less intensity, and more importantly, no fear responses, is called \"systematic desensitisation\". The technique in this video is essentially the opposite, starting with HIGH levels of stimuli and is known as \"Flooding\".\n\nFlooding is definitely not seen as an ideal technique for reducing fearful responses in dogges. The [AHS](https://www.animalhumanesociety.org/training/counter-conditioning-and-desensitization) and [PetMD](http://pets.webmd.com/desensitization-and-counterconditioning?page=2) have good write-ups detailing how to train using the systematic desensitisation and counter-conditioning techniques.", "id": "d6jd0dp"}, {"comment": "Video of cute rescue dog having a meal with a vet... redditor explaining to everyone that the vet is basically hitler and destroying the dogs life.\n\nI'm not saying you're wrong, I just knew it was going to happen.", "id": "d6je596"}, {"comment": "Ah yes.

This is \"phantom limb pain\" as described by amputees. Since other mammals would have the same thing happen, it would stand to reason they would experience something similar.\n\nHOWEVER. Ramachandran demonstrated that you can treat phantom limb pain psychologically. He built a mirror box that makes it look to the patient as if their missing limb is there (it's a mirror reflecting an image of their existing limb). The brain gets visual feedback that the limb is \"responding\" and stops sending signals and the pain stops. Repeated treatment helps it get better over time.\n\nSoooooo yeah. Trippy shit.

After a while this was just involuntary. So this happens because you already had a certain limb for a while so your body gets so used to sending and recieving the same impulses.

Which creature's life is more valuable is certainly up for debate when you take out the bias.  In fact, humans are more destructive than any other creature on the planet.  We are literally capable of completely wiping out all life on the planet with nuclear weapons, and are on our way to making the planet uninhabitable even without superweapons.  From a purely objective standpoint, the rest of the planet would benefit highly from our extinction.\n\nI'm not advocating the genocide of the human race, just to be clear.  I'm just saying that stating that human life is automatically more valuable than any animal life is a product of selfish bias.  There's nothing wrong with selfishly desiring the survival of one's own species; all creatures, sentient or not, strive for their species' survival.  But it should be acknowledged that it is a selfish bias to put more value on your own species.\n\nThese are my personal beliefs; feel free to disagree if you like, but I stand by them.", "id": "d4ujijt"}, {"comment": ">I would argue a human life is worth a lot more than an animals life.\n\nTo be fair you only think this because you're a human.", "id": "d4ulizl"}, {"comment": "Even so, if human lives are worth more than other animals, why allow humans with no quality of life or hope of recovery to continue suffering, but spare animals from it?

Unfortunately, that video of the guy pushing around one of their robots went viral, triggering a lot of negative comments about the uncanny valley and robots taking people's jobs. Which means the company that owns Boston Dynamics soon will very likely not be an American one. \n\n>Boston Dynamics, though, was never folded into Google X and was instead put up for sale. After the division\u2019s latest robot video was posted to YouTube, in February, Google\u2019s public-relations team expressed discomfort that Alphabet would be associated with a push into humanoid robotics. Their subsequent e-mails were also published to the internal online forum and became visible to all Google employees.\n\n> \u201cThere\u2019s excitement from the tech press, but we\u2019re also starting to see some negative threads about it being terrifying, ready to take humans\u2019 jobs,\u201d wrote Courtney Hohne, a director of communications at Google and the spokeswoman for Google X.\n\n> Hohne went on to ask her colleagues to \u201cdistance X from this video,\u201d and wrote, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to trigger a whole separate media cycle about where BD really is at Google.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on this video because there\u2019s really not a lot we can add, and we don\u2019t want to answer most of the Qs it triggers,\u201d she wrote. ([Source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-17/google-is-said-to-put-boston-dynamics-robotics-unit-up-for-sale))\n\nIn short, Americans' negative reactions to silly robot videos is a big part of why they're now [probably going to sell Boston Dynamics to Japan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Dynamics). Or maybe Amazon, but most industry insiders consider that unlikely -- if Alphabet didn't want BD, Amazon is going to be a hard sell, too. \n\nIn short, the Japanese in particular have been comfortable with robotics for a long time, while we are still afraid of them for no logical reason.

If you can avoid surgery, it's for the best. They are great pets and have little to no difference between an altered and non. I will admit though that one of my favorites was a male French Lop that we received as part of a rabbit rescue program my dad was doing. He was neutered and the sweetest guy ever. He would sit with you for hours! He also insisted on hopping down the hall before going back to his cage, and when coming out. He *loved* banana chips. \n\nI've digressed, but my original point is that you should, of course, do what you need to do, but if avoidable, think twice about getting them altered.

I'd rather see bunnies hopping around free in the wild than being assaulted in my living room by my kids' friends who are all \"Squeeee!!! I wanna holda bunnyyyyy!\"\n\nAnyway. My position is you gotta commit the time, attention, and money to properly care for animals if you're going to keep them. I'm sure they love living at your place - I feel like ours spent much of her life in fear of being squeezed by a random child or bunnyraped by the neighbor. \n\nFinally: true sorry, the neighbor bunny had a rap sheet. Lady down the street was a real PETA type and thought he was being neglected because they let him hop around outside. Hopped into her yard one day and she called the police. 19 year old cop shows up and is like \"what am I supposed to do?\" So he throws the bunny in the back of his squad car and drives him back home and reminds the neighbor to keep a better eye on the bunny.

So my experience is 5% cancer risk, 20% dying on the table. See where I'm coming from? Rabbits are fragile, a balloon popping can throw them into a heart attack, it's not worth the extra stress on the animal.

Check these guys out, they're amazing:\n\nhttps://busybunny.com\n\nOdds are the rabbit is looking for some fun and/or means to keep their teeth in good shape, so encourage healthy chewing by tossing a wooden a-frame in the room (we went through a few of these over the years, Phoebe LOVED them (also provided her with a sweet little fort)):\n\nhttps://store.busybunny.com/mobile/tent-tunnel-extra-large-bb-18xl-p1293.aspx\n\nSo it's a bit of trial and error and diligence. Rabbits will respond to commands (a gentle redirection with the hand or a snap of the fingers will discourage negative behavior). Phoebe, when she knew she was doing something wrong, KNEW IT. You'd snap your fingers and she'd hop away flipping her ears -- then she'd go to a toy and do something more productive. So boredom? Willfulness? Attention seeking? Man, I feel like I'm talking about toddlers..\n\nUnless rabbits are geriatric and unable to keep themselves clean, there's no need to wash a rabbit -- and even then, a \"dry bath\" is recommended. Grooming (brushing) and keeping their litter box spic-and-span is most important. If the rabbit lives in a cage that is full of litter, consider an alternative -- make sure there are plenty of clean surfaces for it to chill on. We built tasteful enclosures for Phoebe and our (still living) Netherlands Dwarf, Nugget, that have carpeted shelves and floor; stays clean and the litter box is all that needs frequent tending to.\n\nRabbits are super clean beasts. Most of the time if they are smelly, I'm guessing they are laying around in their own, uh, stuff. And they'd probably prefer not to, so change up their living situation. Even in a smaller enclosure, only put bedding/litter in the litter box; cover the remaining floor with a folded towel (and keep an eye to ensure the rabbit, since it likes to chew, isn't chewing said towel). And let it roam as much as possible.\n\nWhoo. That's a lot. I mean, I'm no expert, so I'm sure others have different opinions, but everything we've read and experiences indicates the above to be helpful -- so good luck to your friend!", "id": "daqei2g"}, {"comment": "Woah, thanks for taking the time and effort to type this thoughtful reply!  \n\nHe kept his rabbit in a cage byt also allow it to roam the house, and the cage is pretty clean.

He and Phoebe were friends, but not bonded. This, in and of itself, is a long story.\n\nThe short version, even though I am awful at keeping things short, is that he was found, in his cage, in the dead of winter behind a school in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. His back leg was dislocated, the knee was busted, and so our friends called us up and were like, \"Uh, we just found this little dude..\" -- the rest was just impossible to avoid: he had the best little spirit, even amidst that crazy leg he had going on. We loved the little guy immediately and were happy to take him in.\n\nWorked with an awesome vet who kept him temporarily while trying all they could to salvage his leg, but we all knew it was too far gone -- they ended up having to amputate it. Even before the amputation, you could tell he'd had a shit diet, uneducated handlers.. he was unaltered, so we squared that away, also. After ten days, he came to live with us and was just a fucking champ for the next few years. Would've loved to have him around longer, but we knew that every day was like -- not to be trite -- a toooootal gift. His spirit was a fuzzy inspiration and I feel fortunate that we got to experience a special needs pet. He got around fine, if not a bit janky, and he did everything himself 'til he needed help in the later period with grooming the, y'know.. all that stuff in the back.\n\nAnd he was a lop. He would try so hard to look regal, but he would act like such a goof. Since him, I've always wanted to add a lop back into the mix.\n\nSee? I knew I couldn't make this short (and even in my truncating, I left out a million awesome details), but.. photo:\n\nhttps://s19.postimg.org/5hlaxl44z/image.jpg\n\nRIP, Rabbi T.", "id": "daqeztz"}], [{"comment": "how is that rabbit so nice looking? mine looks like a rabbit version of a hobo..", "id": "daq3fx5"}], [{"comment": "*M U N C H*", "id": "daq5pwk"}, {"comment": "chew", "id": "daq6nda"}, {"comment": "what a beautiful duwabbit", "id": "daq8o5z"}, {"comment": "Wow, I expected someone to get the joke but not the actual comment OP.

But then they say:\n\n>Does NOAA Fisheries Service have a policy about interacting with marine mammals in the wild?\nNOAA Fisheries Service maintains a policy on human interactions with wild marine mammals that states:\n\n>Interacting with wild marine mammals should not be attempted, and viewing marine mammals must be conducted in a manner that does not harass the animals.\nNOAA Fisheries Service does not support, condone, approve, or authorize activities that involve closely approaching, interacting, or attempting to interact with whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals, or sea lions in the wild. This includes attempting to swim with, pet, touch, or elicit a reaction from the animals.\n\nThat kind of contradicts the previous paragraph. I wasn't \"attempting\" to swim with that dolphin, but since he wants to...\n\nMy personal view is that if I'm swimming in the sea and a dolphin comes up to investigate me, I'll hold still and let him do that. If he blows bubbles at me and wants to be playful, I'll do that too. \n\nI'd extend that courtesy to any aquatic mammal.

Honestly, if you are gone 8 to 9 hours 5 days a week it's pretty much a non-issue for an older dog. Start looking at shelters for an older dog, 5+ years old. I assure you that dogs would vastly prefer your house alone than crammed in to a shelter cage with 50+ other dogs just waiting for the end. \n\nAll you need to do is honestly evaluate your life. \n\nHow often do you like to go out with friends? At the bar every weekend and don't want to change? You probably don't want a dog.\n\nYou travel for work often (twice a month or more)? May not want to get a dog unless you have a family member that wants to time share a pup or something,\n\nYou train for marathons? You probably do want a dog, but maybe a 2 year old instead of a senior.\n\nYou hike in the mountains? You probably do want a dog but don't count out the small ones, a lot of them were bred to work as well.\n\nIf you count out a dog, cats could work too! Especially two older cats. You can look on Craigslist and find plenty of people rehoming a bonded pair of older cats. Shelters that keep cats in communal rooms will also be able to identify cats that are bonded and preferable to be adopted together. It's harder to find people to take both so you'd probably be greatly welcomed. Cats DO need attention, and quite a bit of it, but they are much more chill about it. \n\nNotice that I'm saying older animals for both. Puppies are helpless and need A TON Of TIME. They can only hold thier bladder for 1 hour per month of life. They will actively try to eat and do things that will kill them. They will destroy everything they are left alone with for 5 minutes. Also kittens are spawns of Satan. They're cute so you are less compelled to toss them out the window after you find out they shredded the curtains AND the blinds in the 2 minutes you stepped out to check the mail.

They don't jump and play, they drool and slump over and die.\n\niirc there's only one animal that can carry the Rabies virus but not be affected by it - bats.  This is why bats are NEVER safe to handle unless by a trained professional.  They can transmit the virus with no outward signs.\n\nSo, if the half-tame fox/raccoon/cat you feed every day isn't acting completely insane, chances are it's not infected.\n\nAnother good litmus test is eating/drinking.  If your half-tame fox/raccoon/cat is eating the food you set out for it, chances are it's not infected (rabies makes the throat swell up, swallowing is painful, hence the \"foaming\" or drooling).\n\nSo no, we don't just shoot wild animals in the head when they get near our pets.  Use your eyeballs and common sense, as well as a little extra knowledge about the effects of the virus.

They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"weasel family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Mustelidae, which includes things from ferrets to wolverines to badgers.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a stout a weasel is because random people \"call the little furry ones weasels?\" Let's get mice and racoons in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A stoat is a weasel and a member of the weasel family. But that's not what you said. You said a stoat is a weasel, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the weasel family weasels, which means you'd call blue minks, otters, and other animals weasels, too.

Making sure mama cleans the shit off the baby saved a lot more kids lives than trying to keep mama happy, even when we take into account infanticide. \n\nThere's also the fact that we're social animals, and the shame/outcast one might face if they killed their baby would be a death sentence.

What effect winged hussars had on that battle cannot be overstated.\n\nMilitary doctrines were pretty asymmetrical between the Ottoman and the European armies. Ottomans at the time had overall much better logistics, supplies, higher numbers, not to mention Janissaries, however they lacked in maneuverability and discipline which European armies have developed as a protection against cavalry.\n\nWhen the army that was to lift the siege has arrived, they have managed to take a pretty bad spot. They had higher ground, but the slope was pretty rugged for the cavalry to just go charging down hill. However, the siege has eroded the morale of the besieging army as well. The leader of the the relieving army (don't recall his name) expected the battle to take days, but they have managed to break through pretty successfully at the start, and had to make a choice whether to let their exhausted army rest and let the Ottomans regroup, or try to push ahead. They decided to push and it has paid off, they now had a good enough position for the hussars to charge.\n\nSobieski first sent a small force of hussars just to try the Ottomans defences, but even this small force has managed to make an impressive dent to Ottomans. So when he then decided to send all the winged hussars, Ottoman armies had enough, they morale was eroded by the months of siege and incompetent management of their siege camp, they had little discipline to fall back to, and so when they have seen much larger force of hussars charging against them, despite their much larger numerical advantage, their entire army just broke.\n\nMy source for this is \"The Enemy at the Gate: Habsburgs, Ottomans and the Battle for Europe\" by Andrew Wheatcroft, although my memory might be faulty on some things. \n\nEDIT: words", "id": "d8wvkwr"}, {"comment": "Damn that's awesome.
