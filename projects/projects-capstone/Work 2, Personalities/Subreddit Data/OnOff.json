However, she has changed my perspective on what makes me feel that gutteral misery you're mentioning, which was almost a painful feeling of envy. I still get it, but it's no longer for just strikingly hot women and in most cases it's a woman who is still attractive, but has her head on right, successful and/or truly smart / introspective / mature. You see my relationship problems stem from her procrastination, lack of maturity when it comes to priorities like paying bills, knowing how to research, planning ahead, her motivation in life, etc. May not sound that glamorous as it does to someone who has actually had this relationship dynamic for a couple years like me, but it's a huge source of my misery. She was a silver spoon-fed brat and she was never really led properly by her parents and now I have to teach her to pick up the slack and we're plagued with resent. Anyway, my point is beautiful women are really nice, but once that new factor wears off they become just as fulfilling and physically attractive to you as any other relationship you've had (assuming you were attracted to her). To put it bluntly, I was a straight horn dog and now I can go weeks without intimacy with her because of how her shortcomings affect me subconsciously.

You just have your head too far up your ass to comprehend any perspective but your own.\n\nNo one sends nudes on the assumption that there's no possibility that they will be revealed to others. Your entire logic falls apart right at the start. They send them taking a risk but have enough trust in the person to hope they wouldn't lie to them.\n\nYou're making a lot of assumptions about their relationship based off one picture. There's a very good chance her relationship was perfectly fine and the guy just decided to be a piece of shit and post those pictures. Could have been after the relationship ended for all we know, because he couldn't handle the breakup and lashes out. \n\nSame with the cheating thing. More often than not, obviously there are some relationship issues that lead to it, but that's not always the case. Sometimes the girl or guy just feels like fucking other people even in a very decent relationship. And either way, there is no excuse for cheating. If there really are issues so bad that your partner isn't good enough anymore, then break up with them.\n\nThat's why i made comparisons to getting hit by a car or being cheated on. In all of these cases, you put your trust in something, whether it's a law or just a rule in relationships (not fucking around with other people). Just because your trust is violated doesn't necessarily make you dumb. \n\nSure, getting hit by a car because you didn't look both ways does make you dumb and put you partially at fault. Sure, trusting some random guy you barely know with your nudes partially put you at fault.\n\nI do agree with you that there are a lot of factors that could go into deciding where the fault, or parts of it, lie. But my point is that it's entirely possible for the victim to have not done anything wrong.\n\nFor example, a pedestrian can take all the necessary precautions to not get in a car accident but a freak accident can still occur and they could get hit by a random car anyway. Someone could also take all the necessary precautions when sending nudes to someone they trust and still be betrayed. The only way to completely avoid it is to not take nudes, obviously.\n\n\nBut if you're gonna argue that every single person who sends nudes is an idiot partially at fault, then you should also argue that anyone who leaves home and gets in a freak car accident is also an idiot partially at fault, which you shouldn't if you have any common sense.
