That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon & McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as \"Tommy\" and \"Quadrophenia\"; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses.", "id": "d5wchhh"}, {"comment": "/mu/ too thanks", "id": "d5wdso2"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d5whb05"}, {"comment": "Work work work work work work work ", "id": "d5vzhjd"}, {"comment": "*indistinguishable mumbling*\n\nOh sorry you said work seven times that's not the Rhianna song.

They filter air and often they will alternate, one side will enlarge and the other will shrink. Occasionally both sides shrink, like you experience, but typically that doesn't last long.  Turbinate hypertrophy is a condition where turbinates are chronically enlarged/inflamed.  This results in a blocked nose.  \n\nThis is most often caused by allergies or chronic infection.  When your body detects something it considers dangerous (allergen) it releases histamines which bind to where the allergens are and causes an inflammatory reaction.  This can be treated with antihistamines which stop histamines from binding to tissue or through shots which makes it so your body no longer considers the allergens dangerous.  Antihistamines can sometimes cause drowsiness which is why they are often taken at night.  \n\n\nChronic sinusitis (inflamed sinuses) are also often caused by allergies.  Chronic sinusitis can also be caused by infection.  Often persistent cases of chronic sinusitis are caused by both allergies and infection.  Inside your nose are something called cilia, which are like thousands of brooms that sweep unwanted particles out your nostrils and also down the back of your throat.  Inflammation from allergies prevent the cilia from working properly, which creates an ideal environment for bacteria growth.  \n\n\nSome theories say that bacteria create something called a biofilm which is a super colony of bacteria that bind together and adhere to a surface (sinuses).  This type of bacteria can be difficult to treat because antibiotics, which work by stoping bacteria from reproducing, are unable to penetrate these colonies and stop the reproduction process.  Persistent cases of chronic sinusitis, which often last for years are difficult to treat because it is hard to determine what the underlying cause of illness is (infection vs allergies or both).  \n\n\nThick yellow or colored mucous is a clear sign of infection.  Anecdotally some people have notes they have relived their symptoms by reducing the consumption of gluten or dairy but I am unaware of any studies confirming this.  \n\nSome people with persistent cases that last years often require an aggressive treatment that includes x2 daily sinus rinses with salt water, decongestants, allergy treatment, healthy diet, exercise, stress reduction, increased water intake, reducing caffeine, antibiotics, nasal sprays, and supplementation. \n\nI mean - me too fam.\n\nEdit: Paragraphs ", "id": "d1tbz0j"}, {"comment": "Paragraphs.

I order a lemonade and an appetizer of mozzarella cheesesticks, thats it. My only reason for being there is Cheddar Bay Biscuits. The order itself would only cost about $10 on the check (the biscuits are complimentary), plus whatever i feel like tipping; however, my mom was a server for a great part of my childhood and i realized at a young age that a good part of these employees' incomes are tip based. There are times i sit there only 30 minutes before i'm done eating biscuits, but there are also times i'm there for well over an hour. Many servers would be upset at this thought that a customer is occupying one of their tables, for over an hour, and has only rung up a check ~$10, since the common tip percentage is 15-20%. However, my tips are no less than $10 each of these visits, and depending on how respectful the server remains throughout my meal, it can become higher. I once had an exceptional server who waited on me for nearly 2 hours, and when he brought the check for the drink and appetizer I gave him a $50 bill and told him to have a good day. He tried insisting he brings me back some change, but one of the other servers who worked the resteraunt a while longer, and knew of me and my habits walked up to him and told him that this is something i do all the time and they are used to it. \n\n\n\nPeople say that heroin is a hard drug that can cause a huge financial strain on its abusers, as well as many health problems.

This may sound insignificant but it's actually an incredibly efficient way to move around the stage. For example, you can fully sprint towards your opponent to feign attack and quickly wave dash backwards while they miss their attack, and you counter while they recover. Wave landing is another similar technique that greatly improves mobility. \n\nAs for L canceling, that is simply tapping L (or R, but most people use L) when hitting the ground after an aerial attack. This technique removes the recovery time from an aerial attack, so you can move instantly upon hitting the ground. This can be best seen with Link - jump in the air and do a down air. Upon hitting the ground, tap L (it may take a few tries to get the timing right).

After i analyzed all of that i did the decisive thing and just removed all of the things that were taking away from my happiness or didnt foster what made me happy.\n\nI used to think I wanted to be included in everything my friends did, and that all of the people i was \"friends\" with were actually my friends. After my analysis period (it definitely wasnt over night, it was a process of about 6 months of real deep introspection) it turns out i hated the whole \"partying\" lifestyle, no one i met during those ventures wanted to hang out with me afterwards and a few of my, then, friends would just keep dragging me out saying im just not doing it right. So, I cut out people from my life who i have been friends with for many many years, i even cut out one of my \"best friends\" who was one of the first friends i was actually able to make. I found out i really like nerdy things like board games and gaming in general, as well as dungeons and dragons, so i joined a few gaming groups and met people who enjoy the same things i like.\n\nI found that looking objectively at things and trying to remove the emotions out of my thought process really helped me improve my mood. It doesnt mean im a completely apathetic person though. I completely identify with the quote made by robin williams, I know what its like to feel isolated and worthless and want others to never feel that way. \n\nIf someone, anyone even a stranger, ever came up to me and talked to me about their passion, i would always ask them tons of questions and just be totally engrossed in their story, even though they are a stranger, because i want to learn more about people and their history and even more importantly it allows them to feel important for even a moment which can turn someones life around.\n\nAs someone going on mid to late 20s im in a much better place than I was a few years ago. And the great thing is, **you can do it today**. It really is just a thought process switch. I took a stress management class in uni and I learned something that really resonated with me, it was something I was doing but never put into words; if you make that switch and start looking at things positively, you will see the next thing positively and the next, and before you know it it has turned into a wave of positivity that will have changed your life.\n\nThe toughest part is getting yourself to believe in it.\n\nAnd thats what my whole analysis part helped me do, it made me believe that I could be a positive and happy person.

One team is batting, so they have two people with bats in the middle. The other team is fielding- they have 9 men spread out over the field (their position is usually where people start getting confused, with such lovely names as 'Silly Point', 'Second Man', 'Deep Square Leg' and so on), one man standing behind the 'wicket' and another bowling.\n\nIn the centre of the field is a patch of drier ground with a set of 'wickets' at each end (three upright pieces of wood with 2 'bales' at the top). The Bowler runs up to one set of wickets and 'bowls' the ball (not throws- the elbow is not meant to extend) to the batsman at the other end, who either tries to hit the ball or leave it. If the bowler manages to hit the wickets, then the batsman is out. If the batsman hits the ball and any member of the fielding team catch it, he's out. If the ball strikes the batsman's leg (in the course of going on to strike the wickets but being blocked) he's out \"Leg before wicket\".\n\nIf the batsman hits it without incident or the ball otherwise ends up somewhere the fielding team don't have control over it (It's known as a 'by' if the ball runs past/a 'leg-by' if it goes off their leg- note that for an LBW it needs to have struck the leg *in line with the wicket without hitting the bat*) then the batsmen can run- they swap ends of the dry piece of ground in the middle, ensuring that they ground their bats past the line demarking where they would get 'a run' or point. If they manage to hit the ball out of the field in which they play, they get 6 runs (or 4 if it hit the floor on the way). If a batsman is out, they are replaced by another on their team. \n\nA batsman can also be out if the ball is thrown to hit the wicket he's running towards before he grounds his bat past the line. Since you need two batsmen, one at either end, your team is out once you have lost 10 wickets. The scoring in cricket is often demarked Number of runs-number of wickets; for example, 147-6 would be that the team had scored 147 runs for 6 wickets falling. Unless you talk to an Australian, who will insist that it's 6 wickets for 147 runs, that is 6-147.\n\nGames can be a selection of lengths, from 20 overs (an over is 6 bowled balls, illegitimate balls ('No ball', 'wide') gives 1 run and don't count for the over's count of 6, meaning each team bowls ~120 times at the other to a 'test' match, where each team gets to bat twice over the course of 5 days (teams can 'declare' to put their whole team out, but they can also continue to bat in order to force a draw- if you score 250 runs, then I score 200 runs, then you score 250 more runs then declare, if I don't make it to 301 runs by the end of the 5th day, it's a draw- note that days can even be rained off, meaning that you could score much more than me and be in a dominant position just for the rain to make it a draw!).", "id": "d9ucqwq"}, {"comment": "Holy shit I'm even more confused than before.

Everyone gets a go, and the teams switch when 10 of the 11 players are out. \n\nThere are ten ways of getting out. Some are easy and similar to baseball. These are: caught (obvious); Being run out, which is equivalent to not being on the base on time, or however it exactly works in baseball - in cricket you need to be behind the crease (a white line on the ground) before the ball hits the stumps (the three pieces of wood); And finally bowled, which is like the strikes, except the ball has to hit the stumps. So you can miss or leave the bowl as many times as you want to, provided it doesn't hit the stumps. The others you'd largely only get if you actually played, but those are the main ways of getting out (excluding LBW).\n\nThe team that wins is the team that scores the most runs. 1 run for running to one end of the pitch (can run more than one run a ball) 4 runs for hitting it to the boundary if it bounces on the ground, and six if it goes without bouncing.\n\nThere are three formats of cricket. Test, where there's a time limit, and Twenty20 or One day International (ODI) where there's a max number of bowls to score from.

Rather than trying to get it all understood, I'd recommend you start by checking out these two exciting moments from last year's world cup that I shared in a post earlier today - that way it might be a little easier to appreciate *why* some people (like myself) love cricket so much:\n\nContext: When a batsman hits the ball out of the field of play, it's a six - meaning six points (or runs, the term for points in cricket). A six is the equivalent of a home run. Here are two magnificent sixes, complete with NZ commentators screaming the house down during last year's World Cup twice when NZ hit a six to:\n\nA) [Beat Australia in a pool match](http://www.icc-cricket.com/cricket-world-cup/videos/media/id/4079/new-zealand-vs-australia-thrilling-finish) - it's at the 1:00 mark, but watch NZ almost lose the match in the build up. So nerve-wracking!\n\nB) [Advance to the World Cup final](https://youtu.be/V0RA7vepnuU) - watch from 2:07. NZ almost lost this one too, and there was a crucial mistake by South Africa which led to a dropped catch there. The scream is at the end. Without a doubt the most exciting sporting moments I've ever watched. Just don't ask about the final the next week... I was there for the thrashing.\n\nCricket can be slow, but when it gets tense, there's no sport on earth quite like it - though I'd say the end of a basketball game where it's going point for point can be similar.
