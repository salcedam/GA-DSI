Flipped and let sit in chicken broth for like a half hour on  high. Then take either a whole small tub if mango peach salsa (like at Costco/shop rite) and some fresh salsa or blend a mango jam with a regular salsa. Tossed that on top for an hour. Then I took the chicken out real quick and shred the shit out of it. Tossed it back in there with 2-3 ounces of cream cheese and some Mexican cheese added, let it cook on low for about five hours, stirring frequently since my slow cooker gets too hot and I wanted a creamy sauce, I'd say in the oven you could toss it in at maybe 300 for a half hour covered in salsa and cream cheese (mixed) if you want, then garnish with cheese and turn the heat up to 375. I crumbled up some tortilla chips and tossed them in there which helped soak up extra cheesiness, then served it over chips and rice, I'm kind of buzzed so I hope that makes sense. I hear it's better to wait till the last hour to add the cheese but I did it pretty early and it kept shit moist.

One of the biggest failures of The Office was that it gave up on developing its core characters halfway through. The development of Jim and Pams relationship was the end of Jim's relevance as a character. They kept it up with Pam a little longer with her whole art thing, but gave up on that pretty quickly too. Once Jim and Pam had kids, they basically became characters whos lives seemed to primarily exist outside the confines of work, and therefore outside the confines of the show. This is pretty realistic really, but it isnt interesting storytelling. Even if they wanted to go down the route of \"Jim and Pam go from star crossed lovers to boring domestic parents\", they could have had some conflict in that transition.\n\nThey made a few attempts to continue the character development, but it always seemed weird and inconsistent. First Jim became more ambitious and was trying to get Michaels job, then next season when Michael left and Jim is offered his job he turns it down, then in the last season Jim is ambitious again but this time with a sports marketing business that had no bearing on anything we know about Jim from seasons 1-8 (except that he likes sport). \n\nI think what would have been interesting is if after Jim and Pam get together, Pams art starts to take off and she wants to pursue it more and move to NYC or something, but Jim likes their quiet life in Scranton. It would be good if Jims character flaws actually had implications for his relationship with Pam.

Sure there are a good amount of black people who harm others and such but a even larger amount just want to live.  \n\nNobody likes the hood other than hoodrats and they don't have anything really going for them and they don't really care to try and better themselves. Then you have the black people that absolutely hate the hood and want to get out of there before they end up dead for some stupid ass reason. The ones that study hard, constantly practice at sports, and other things that'll get them out of there. They want better for themselves and their families. \n\nEven some of the most ghetto people I've ever met can't stand to live in the city or even near a hood. They have done a lot of things that fucked up their life and pretty much kept them in the hood but they hate the way they ended up. \n\nI'm not a ghetto black guy at all but I do see that people fear me simply because of the color of my skin. I grew up in the suburbs and even as a kid walking around in the store with a group of white people I'd get funny looks. Some peoples parents would tell them not to hang out with me so they wouldn't get in trouble but then they did and I'd be no where near them. When I finally did get in trouble I quickly realized that even though people fear black people thinking we are going to harm them if you go to a city with less than 10% of the people are minorities and walk into a jail you'll quickly see that the color of the skin doesn't matter. I was in juvenile detention with a bunch of white kids, 2 were waiting to be transferred to the juvenile prison, a few were in there for stealing cars, robbing houses and people with weapons, rape, and selling drugs. Me? Smoking weed while on probation. I was on probation for giving a white kid at school a few of my pills and he told. The years went on and my friend a white kid, were finally adults. He told me there wasn't a single black male in the jail in the same city. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is. Black people will get showcased in the media more than white people, for the same crimes. The media will also show pictures of black people looking far worse than the white people. White people usually get a nice picture like a yearbook photo or something when a black man could have a nice professional looking picture on Facebook and they'll go for the mugshot instead. \n\nYour friend I can understand why he feels the way he does, if I were in his position I'd be a little more hesitant around black people and probably fear them but the way I've always been is not to lump a group of people together no matter what so I don't think that experience would really change much for me.", "id": "d5lw489"}, {"comment": "Honestly, everything about this incident screams \"negligent discharge\" to me.

Not to mention the advantages a wired connection brings (no concern about battery life, less likely to lose, etc). Now of course, whether you use one or the other is a matter of preference. Which is why any good smartphone should give you that option.\n\nAs for your insistance that Apple 'invented every aspect of the smartphone', not even Apple would get behind that claim. Of course they didn't invent touchscreens. Or mobile web. Or any of the other countless innovations that come together to make the modern smartphone. Hell, they didn't even invent the concept of bringing them all together for a single product. (See the early Palm, Blackberry, Sidekick, and G1).\nYet I think we'd agree that they defined the modern smartphone. They took all those disparate elements, and made one product that put it all together with seamless ease. It's what Apple has always done, and continue to do. \nBut in recent years, their lag over the competition is getting more noticeable - and their polish less admirable. The main features from iOS 10 (gesture controls, voice search integration with 3rd party apps, predictive typing, dynamic traffic in maps, visual voicemail, etc) have been possible on Android devices for ages. They've also been done well. Apple will tie it all together in the base package, but the lag is only getting worse.\nA part of this is simply due to the fact that way more companies are producing Android phones. There's more competition in the market, and more incentive for hardware manufacturers to introduce new tech like mobile VR, wireless charging, and reactive displays (I don't even need to touch my Moto X to turn on the screen. I can just wave my hand over it, and see if I have a new text/update/etc.).\n\nRemoving the jack feels like Apple trying to muscle their way forward in a market that is proving them unnecessary. They want to declare headphones to be dead, and turn exclusion of features into a status symbol. It's why I just can't abide with their products.  The product isn't worth the price.", "id": "d7nd67i"}, {"comment": ">I haven't plugged anything into my phones headphone jack in years.\nMy car has bluetooth.\n\nCongratufuckinglations you going to buy everyone a car with Bluetooth so we can all feel as entitled as you?

We took waka to the bathroom in the room and hit a gravity out of a huge bucket and he said \"shit you white boy's are crazy\" - evidently it was his first gravity hit. We didn't show the blunts until we were in the bathroom just three of us and him and when he saw the sack we convinced him to go to the room next door so we could smoke in a less crowded, fanboy environment. Sure enough we walk out to people trying to get in enameled by them man-he is fucking massive. \n\nWe get into the next door room and start smoking these blunts. It was a lot less people and we got to hear a lot more from Waka and his friend, it was fucking great. We finish one and start another when midway through his friend tells him they have to get down and get ready. He daps us up and leaves the room and walks down the hallway through a crowd of people just lined up on the walls trying to see him. The man has the biggest fucking hands, and the blunt was between two fingers as he walked out. We remained sitting on this couch too stoned to realize that he walked out with the blunt. I realize and walk out and yell  at the top of my lungs \"Waka, pass the fucking blunt\" (I was drunk). He was already at the staircase, heard me and walked back through the massive crowd of people, 5 rooms down, and handed me the blunt back. He goes \"my fault nigga\" and daps me up then walks back down.

I'm out.\" \n\nThankfully, I lived right across the street from my friend so it wasn't too far, but in order to get there, I had to cross the street. As I got closer and closer to the road, (it was just a regular residential street.) I could not comprehend how I could possibly cross the street without being hit by a car. I stepped out into the street and was prepared for my life to end by a car going 20mph. \n\nA car did end up coming, but I successfully crossed the street and was now at my residential complex.

I search the entire house, looking in the closets and under the bed. I even went out to the garage just to make sure. So I go in my room and start playing N64. The phone rings.\n\n\"Hello.\", I say into the phone.\n\n\"Hey, what's up, taqfu? What's going on, man?\"\n\n\"Nothing, man. I'm at a payphone right now. What's up?\"\n\n\"A pay phone? Dude, we called you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. I was just joking. What's up?\" I wasn't joking.

But nausea comes in waves with weed so you may feel horrible for one minute and amazing the next by just steadying your breathing.\n\n- always listen to your dealer!!! It don't matter if you're a smoking god, you can't undigest stuff!!! \n\n- always be skeptical, all edibles are different so don't expect the same trip/feeling all the time. \n\n- have fun and be around good vibes :)))))"], [2, "i've only tried home made edibles that taste like shit and made me feel a little warm and fuzzy. can't wait to move to a medicinal state where the products fuck you up like this."], [2, "So my first experience with edibles was my first experience with pot in like 20 years.

My friend babysat for a local business man who also dealt weed to his close friends. My friend had the option of being paid cash or taking it in weed. \n\nSo one weekend my buddy, a couple other friends and I planned on getting high (at this point it wasn't a regular occurrence), so dude said he would grab some weed. Since the business man wasn't home he told my friend to just grab it. My friend already knew the layout of this guy's stash. Ditch weed on one end, better strains going down the line, finally ending at what was known then as \"primo\"; weed dusted with cocaine. \n\nSince we were new to weed, and my buddy didn't have much credit at the time, he grabbed a sack of ditch weed, and met up with us at another friend's parents house. We went down into the basement, and began making our soda can pipe. We snuck off around the side of the house, smoked as much weed as we possibly could (you know, because it was ditch weed) and then decided to take a walk before going back in, to air out. \n\nAs we walked down the street, I could see my friends start sticking their hands out to their sides, steadying themselves as they walked, and then noticed that my feet were seemingly lifting off the ground. Shortly after that, I felt my soul start to lift above my body (See Bobby), and started to realize what happened. We floated back to my friends house, and tried to watch Alice in Wonderland, but when she started falling through the tree my body decided it was time to come back to earth. \n\nI ran outside, and started laughing hysterically while throwing up everything I had eaten that day.

But nausea comes in waves with weed so you may feel horrible for one minute and amazing the next by just steadying your breathing.\n\n- always listen to your dealer!!! It don't matter if you're a smoking god, you can't undigest stuff!!! \n\n- always be skeptical, all edibles are different so don't expect the same trip/feeling all the time. \n\n- have fun and be around good vibes :)))))", "id": "d9of84f"}], [{"comment": "i've only tried home made edibles that taste like shit and made me feel a little warm and fuzzy. can't wait to move to a medicinal state where the products fuck you up like this.", "id": "d9o8u0m"}, {"comment": "Homemade edibles can be just as strong and taste just as good as commercial ones!

More than 1,000 people crowded the courtroom but no blacks were allowed. Other than the testimony of the three police officers, at trial prosecutors called three witnesses: Reverend Francis Batson, who discovered the bodies of the two girls, and the two doctors who performed the post-mortem examination. Conflicting confessions were reported to have been offered by the prosecution. The court allowed discussion of the \"possibility\" of rape despite an absence of evidence in the medical examiner's report. Stinney's counsel did not call any witnesses, did not cross-examine witnesses and offered little or no defense. Trial presentation lasted two and a half hours. The jury took ten minutes to deliberate, after which they returned with a guilty verdict. The judge sentenced Stinney to death by the electric chair. There is no transcript of the trial.

I spent the summer interning at a consulting company that reviewed DNA evidence from court cases for prosecutors or defense attorneys and it was frightening, depressing, and enraging simultaneously. There was a case we were reviewing where the officers who collected the DNA evidence included a note saying that the guy was a gangbanger who had gotten off on other cases so they wanted to really stick it to him on this case. So of course the DNA analysts allowed that to bias their findings and said that the guy's DNA was definitely on the gun, even though no one in their right could have come to that conclusion if they were not allowing biases to effect them. The case lasted several years and the court finally accepted that the analyst's conclusion was incorrect. \n\nThere have also ben multiple cases I've seen where the DNA analysts lied about the results and the significance of their findings.

The DNA labs are literally just running data through these programs with no idea of how it works and then blindly trusting the results. When I finished my internship we were reviewing a case in which the lab used one program for their analysis and the results were not damning at all so then they went and used a different program to analyze the same results, and this program returned totally different results that were very damning so they chose to present the second program's findings in court without acknowledging the program their lab typically uses determined the results to be inconclusive. We only figured it out because we were reading through their documentation of testing on the samples.\n\nHonestly the whole criminal justice system in the US is fucked and rotten all the way through.

In one version Stinney was attacked by the girls after he tried to help one girl who had fallen in the ditch and he killed them in self defense. In the other version he had followed the girls, first attacking Mary Emma and then Betty June. There was no physical evidence linking him to the murders. There is no written record of Stinney's confession apart from Deputy Newman's statement.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stinney)\n\n[Stinney's trial had an all-white jury. More than 1,000 people crowded the courtroom but no blacks were allowed. Other than the testimony of the three police officers, at trial prosecutors called three witnesses: Reverend Francis Batson, who discovered the bodies of the two girls, and the two doctors who performed the post-mortem examination. Conflicting confessions were reported to have been offered by the prosecution. The court allowed discussion of the \"possibility\" of rape despite an absence of evidence in the medical examiner's report. Stinney's counsel did not call any witnesses, did not cross-examine witnesses and offered little or no defense. Trial presentation lasted two and a half hours. The jury took ten minutes to deliberate, after which they returned with a guilty verdict. The judge sentenced Stinney to death by the electric chair. There is no transcript of the trial.

All credit goes to /u/uluithiad\n\n>Alright, let's do a point by point.\n\n>The first thing to know is that the Eagles were not disregarded. Disregarded usually means we should have had some reason to actually put them up for consideration. The Eagles weren't ever considered and option for the same reason forming an army and attacking Mordor to sweep aside the forces of Mordor win the war was never considered; it just wouldn't work. Anything that takes the position that the Eagles were an option, and that different options were taken instead of them is something not worth listening to, because in destroying the Ring they had the strategic importance of wearing bread as a hat.\n\n>As to why I think this guy writing this article is an idiot, instead of just ignorant, there's just so much that's straight up wrong about what is claimed.\n\n>Gandalf did not 'think' to get the Eagles to help him. An Eagle popped by based on a plan set into motion with Radagast earlier on, and seeing that Gandalf was imprisoned, abandoned the idea of giving a report and instead saved Gandalf.\n\n>Gandalf neither goes to Rivendell or to the home of the Eagles in the Misty Mountains. He goes very close by, to Rohan, and Meduseld, and then gets a horse to ride back to Eriador to find Frodo and get help from Rivendell. The Eagle specifically tells Gandalf that he cannot take him a great distance. Flying is hard and people are heavy.\n\n>The writer appears to think the Eagles would have plans of fighting off greater numbers. Of what, exactly? Sauron had not yet revealed the Nazgul's hellhawks. The writer is operating under the assumption that force is how you get into Mordor, and has clearly never read the books with any appreciable reading comprehension, since those make it clear time and time again that secrecy and feints are the only option.\n\n>Then, the article's writer argues that secrecy was needed, and fails to account for how an armada of giant flying birds headed straight for Mordor would not be the most obvious play ever.\n\n>The idea that Gandalf wouldn't trust Elrond with this plan, and would therefore be overburdened with party members, is completely insane. I cannot stress how stupid this idea is.\n\n>The High Pass was not infested with Orcs. We hear quite plainly that Beorn's people have been making sure of that. The High Pass, like Caradhras when they get to it, is infested with winter.\n\n>Saruman did not send a storm. At this point, it is clear that this article's writer has never even opened up the books. This alone should be enough to ignore everything he rattles on about. Also, if we accept that the bad guys can see where the Fellowship is going, how could they ever secretly turn north to head to the Eagles. This means they should have gone over the High Pass, since their turning north would give their enemies less time to prepare (since they would have to go less north). The writer of the article is not cognizant enough of his own implications to understand the whole plot just failed (even in respect to the movies).\n\n>Gandalf doesn't know about the Balrog.\n\n>'Fly' means flee. Unless someone is actually flying, fly means flee. Flee quickly. You can look this up in a dictionary. If you've read the books, you can see Tolkien use the word in this way frequently, including three sentences later, when Aragorn and Boromir, who had charged toward Gandalf's standoff and were on the bridge, come 'flying' back, doing exactly what he told them to. At this point, we reaffirm that the writer has never read the books, and quite possibly has not touched a dictionary either.\n\n>It's a shitty fan theory.

But it gets a bit aggravating when some people like to keep hammering on about it.

Did I mention it's June? It's hot as fuck outside (public schools normally use outside ampatheters or giant halls which are also hot af with 3000 people inside) I'm dying, everyone is dying, I wanna go. Ok so now we gotta announce the scholarships... that's 20 minutes down the hole. And then finally the announcer shambles in and gets their notes together and probably takes until 11 we will say.\n\nSo first name is called, let's use your math and say we give everyone 10 seconds of applause. We are figuring this is under perfect circumstances where everyone walks at the same pace and it's within perfect 10 seconds. \n\nThat's 6 fucking people a minute... 6... fucking... people.

This is what happens when large socioeconomic rifts are allowed to remain for a long time. The societal oscillations will by necessity correspond to the pent up potential negative energy in said society. \n\nIf a substantial portion of the population for whatever reason believe that they have been receiving the shorter end of the stick, it will eventually cause severe societal disturbance and even civil unrest.\n\nCouple this to the fact that the media of TV is fairly new and something our brains haven't evolved to cope with in a rational way. When we watch a movie, we react strongly and emotionally to what effectively is a form of elaborate deception for entertainment purposes.\n\nThe media and politicians abuse this fact and use this fairly new form of communication (only a few generations old) to push agendas based not on facts and data, but rather strong emotions and irrationally. Creating huge confusion amongst millions upon millions of citizens unaware of the dishonest communication they are being exposed to. \nAfter all, you do feel your own real feelings even if what triggered them isn't necessarily accurate. \n\nIn a world where you only die once, negative emotions is what protects us from early demise. Pain ensures that we avoid self-destruction.

Addicting, captivating and maddening.\n\nAn oversimplification if there ever was one, and many other factors deserve to be mentioned. But these are some basic key ingredients for disaster in democracy-town. The collapse of former Yugoslavia is the perfect example of this. \n\nHonest and constructive conversation between the different political positions have all but ceased completely. Any attempt at understanding or reconciliation is treated as treason of the cause and gets people labeled as traitors.\n\nThis is the punishment for not being responsible and educating the population to the point where they can be trusted to make rational decision themselves.\nRight now the mutual distrust between state and citizen is huge, and the state will rarely communicate honestly with its subjects.

The man recently appointed as the President of the Commission (which is the most powerful position in the EU), Jean Claude Juncker, has just called for an EU army. People in Britain simply aren't interested in becoming part of a federal Union , anymore than they're interested in becoming the 51st state of the USA. Britain could have stayed in and vetoed any further centralization, but it is arguably reasonable (although admittedly not very tactically smart) to step aside and let the others get on with it.\n\nAlso, the EU has not been well run. Because of the desire for centralization, there is a lack of pragmatism in what in American terms you might call federal over-reach, and then an inability to handle the situations Brussels has taken responsibility for. For instance, with the single currency, they went ahead with the scheme because it meant more power at a European level, despite its fundamental lack of stabliziation mechanisms when problems arise.

By accompanying these images of Dachau with the great Mighty Mighty Bostones hit, Speilberg is reflecting on the great impact Dachau had; not just on the Jews, but more importantly on the future of ska music. \n\nThe 'impression that Speilberg gets' is that Dachau was more than we give it credit for, he thinks it is important that we recognise the good that it did for music, while still reflecting on the terrible things that happened there.

It takes a while for others. Usually around the 2nd/3rd week of school all of the clubs have a rush week. Look at different organizations and join some. I rushed a coed frat last semester as a commuter/transfer/ working a full time job student. It was hectic but so worth it. I started school this week and I have a solid social group to hang out with during my breaks. \n\n\nA couple of other things to mention, visit your professor during their office hours. Even if you dont need help. Just go in there and introduce your self. Trust me if you visit them and engage with them periodically they will remember you and give you a solid letter of recommendation if you ask them. \n\nAnother tip try to join into the discussions as much as possible. I had A philosophy professor rip me a new asshole every time I brought up my thoughts on what ever he was lecturing (he did that to every one and scared people off) but I never took it personally it was a learning experience. This professor saw me in middle of the quad and yelled out my name and waved me over to see how I was doing. That wouldnt have happened if I kept my head low and avoided discussion. \n\nLast point is watch out for the freshmen 15. Its fucking real. Go to the gym you pay for it in your tuition.

I dont wanna study so Ill answer and then some.\n\n>\"Do I have to raise my hand to go to the bathroom?\"\n\nJust go. \n\n>\"Do we have a curfew to be back in our dorms at a certain time?\"\n\nOver all no. Just know that there is a time when you have to be quiet at night. (around 10pm or 11pm during week days)\n\n\"Do we have to bring everything we own back home for Christmas break?\"\n\n>Nope.\n\n>\"FUCK! I missed my 10AM. Am I going to get in trouble?\"\n\nDepends on the Professor and the class. Some professors do take attendance. Usually they give you 1-3 freebies with out anything happening. But if you go past those you will lose points. \n\nMake sure you get the notes from some one.\n\n\n>\"My professor said we have a test on Friday, but he didn't have a review day today. He just went on to the next chapter. That's not fair!\"\n\nWelcome to college. Manage your shit. Dont go straight to your dorm after class. Go to the library study for a bit. Netflix will still be there when you finish.\n\n\n\n>\"My roommate goes out every night with his squad, and I'm just sitting in my room with nothing to do and no friends!\"\n\nSome people make friends quick. It takes a while for others. Usually around the 2nd/3rd week of school all of the clubs have a rush week. Look at different organizations and join some. I rushed a coed frat last semester as a commuter/transfer/ working a full time job student. It was hectic but so worth it. I started school this week and I have a solid social group to hang out with during my breaks. \n\n\nA couple of other things to mention, visit your professor during their office hours. Even if you dont need help. Just go in there and introduce your self. Trust me if you visit them and engage with them periodically they will remember you and give you a solid letter of recommendation if you ask them. \n\nAnother tip try to join into the discussions as much as possible. I had A philosophy professor rip me a new asshole every time I brought up my thoughts on what ever he was lecturing (he did that to every one and scared people off) but I never took it personally it was a learning experience. This professor saw me in middle of the quad and yelled out my name and waved me over to see how I was doing. That wouldnt have happened if I kept my head low and avoided discussion. \n\nLast point is watch out for the freshmen 15. Its fucking real. Go to the gym you pay for it in your tuition. Watch what you eat. And go to the gym there are so many hotties up in there. \n\n\n", "id": "d6za66t"}, {"comment": "want to add to the bathroom thing. make sure you aren't the first one to go so you can see how a professor handles it. ive seen professors bitch out students in a 300 person lecture hall for using the bathroom. just have a sob story ready if they call you out. like \"sorry my dad is in the hospital and i told my mom to call me when they heard something.\" ", "id": "d6zbas0"}, {"comment": ">have a sob story\n\n\n\nFuck that.

The messages were something a passive aggressive girlfriend would send before starting an argument even though she's acting like nothing happened; \"I just find it funny that you had no problem texting me but when I text you, you block me\" and \"I just want us to talk like that night we first met\". Bitch is CRAZY.

Also, the Latino vote was heavily skewed by the older Cubans, who couldn't care less for the plight of Mexicans, Guatemalans and the other Central America latinos that make he bulk of the illegal population. Plus, they lean to the right because they were abused by a communist government. Also, older Cubans (younger generations are leaning democrat) tend to have what we call a \"fuck you, I got mine mentality\": they came here as LITERAL refugees, yet 59% of Miami Cubans voted Trump.

If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying \"melt family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of meltae, which includes things from tuna melts to pulled pork melts to chicken melts. So your reasoning for calling a melt a grilled is because random people \"call the extra ingredients grilled cheese?\" Let's get steak and bacon melts in there, then, too. Also, calling something tomato soup or ketchup? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A melt is a melt and a member of the grilled cheese family.

You said a melt is a grilled cheese, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the grilled cheese family melts, which means you'd call Philly Cheese steak, beef dip, and other sandwiches grilled cheese, too.

But people need to start accurately describing their parties from the first text so I know how much effort to put into this. Don't oversell that shit. Real life isn't The Secret where you wish something will be and that's how it is. People need to realize that. Here's how it always goes.\n\n~10:30 pm. Alone in your boxers, one bowl deep, drinking shit beer, playing Assassin's Creed 2 by yourself in the dark for the hundredth time because you're too broke to get anything recent. Then you get the text. \"hey u need to get over here this party bout to get lit\". Okay fine. Better than ending this night ashamed of what I just beat my meat to on RedTube. So you get your lazy ass up, take a shower, put on your one good shirt that you only wear out because it's too flashy to wear on the reg but the hot sales chick said it looked good when you tried it on at Express For Men. Now it's 11:15. You get an Uber ask the Uber guy to take you to the liquor store. Make small talk with the Uber guy and he probably makes some weird comment like \"hey you getting them girls tonight? I bet you're drowning in it, eh?\" I mean, it's like hopefully but I don't want to bond with you at all and definitely not over this slightly misogynistic weirdness but then I'm just like \"haha yeah\" and give him five stars anyway because I don't have time to face every injustice in the world every time I see one especially not when I'm half-baked.\n\nThen you buy a bottle of liquor and a red bull, get back into the Uber. Make it to your boys apartment around 12 and then it's this bull shit. Like if we were just going to smoke blunts and play 2k I would thrown on a pair of piss soaked sweats and a free \"local college spirit week\" t-shirt I got as a freshman and drank the half full plastic bottle of Popov I got for when the inner demons get too noisy.\n\nBut now I did all this work, spent all this money and I'm still going to end the night ashamed of what I just beat my meat to on RedTube. Plus, thanks to that Redbull i drank in the hopes of staying awake long enough to sexually disappoint some girl I just met, now I get to lay awake thinking about all the shitty things I've done to the people who loved me most until I finally pass out at around 5am.\n\nWorse, tho, is that now it's somehow *my* fault.\n\n/rant", "id": "d7z20l5"}, {"comment": "God damn.

You're basically conceiving of the worst case scenario, or at the very least, nothing positive.\n\nIf you go around all day \"expecting\" things to turn out sub-par or mediocre (not necessarily shitty or horrible, just \"meh\"), because that's what it means to have low expectations (\"expectations\" meaning that you're *expecting* something), you might end up carrying around a mediocre mood all day. Which could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Your mediocre expectations result in a mediocre attitude in yourself, at which point you behave mediocre-ly. And nothing great happens.\n\nOf course high expectations can be just as bad, because that sets you up for disappointment if your lofty idealized vision for a situation are not met - which rarely happens. Even when things end up pretty good, they don't tend to meet or exceed the super high expectations we set or imagine.\n\nThis means that the way to be is expectation-free. Be like a Buddhist monk, and just detach from expectations. If you have no expectations, high or low, you can't be disappointed with how things turn out. And if things do turn out badly, you may be in a better position to handle things, because you aren't either \n\n(a) in shock when your high expectations aren't met, leaving you staggering, or \n\n(b) in a depressive mood already from being pessimistic in your expectations. Meaning that now your pessimism seems to be \"confirmed\" - i.e. \"see? I was right. Everything ends up being shitty...\". This, over time, can create a really sour outlook and attitude.\n\nInstead, with no expectations, you are just open to the experience, whatever it is. And if you go into things with an open attitude, cool with whatever, it might actually result in better outcomes.\n\nA perfect example relates to trying to get laid.\n\nIf you go out at night, solo or with your \"crew\", and you're going out with the express purpose of getting pussy, you may actually end up fucking yourself over. Because if you have \"getting laid\" first and foremost on your mind, and are focused on \"pussy pussy pussy\" the whole night, that's going to be telegraphed all over your face during every interaction you have with any girls you talk to. \n\nAnd that can make you look desperate. Which is something girls can sniff out, like how dogs smell fear. A girl will read your desperate, pussy-obsessed one track mind from a mile away, and that's not attractive. Even if the girl herself wants to fuck that night, she may be turned off by the vibe you are giving off, thinking you are either desperate, or even just a \"player\" who is only after one thing. (And the player thing can be an issue, even if it's hypocritical because the girl does want sex too. Because the issue is that the girl still doesn't want to think she's being \"played\". And even though she might want dick as much as you want pussy that night, she might view you negatively if you get assigned that \"player\" or \"horndog\" label. Resulting in no pussy for you).\n\nGoing out with an expectation of getting laid can also lead to an even more increased sense of desperation later in the night if you start to strike out. You could begin to feel - and act - even more desperate in trying to wheel a chick, if you get rejected a couple times. It could get worse by last call, when only Troll Dolls are left at the bar, possibly leading you into a situation you'll regret.\n\nYet if you go out with no expectations of getting pussy - but merely an expectation to go out just for the sake of going out, and maybe to have some fun, your attitude will be relaxed, confident and chill. You're just there to enjoy yourself, up for anything, and with no particular set goals in mind that could distract you from actually enjoying the moment.\n\nAnd as a result, you'll probably give off a more chill, relaxed and confident vibe to the girls you are talking to, which they will lap up like kittens lapping at a milk bowl. You'll be able to talk to them, without conveying the vibe that you're so desperate to fuck. You can flirt and be sexual, and get their number, but still do so while giving off the vibe that you really don't give a fuck, and you'll be happy with or without them. That your enjoyment of this night is not contingent on them spreading their legs for you. That you're able to have fun, with yourself or your friends, and that if they'd like, they can *join you* in your fun. But if not, it's all good.\n\nAnd then if they do seem interested because of how cool you seem, you swoop in and try to close the deal. If so, great. If they still reject you, that's cool too. It doesn't matter. You just went out for the sake of going out, to see where the night takes you, and hopefully to have fun. But you didn't go out to have the \"best night ever!\" like in some teen movie, or tell yourself you \"have to\" get laid tonight.\n\nDetach from expectations. It's way more chill.

We've just elected a grossly unqualified, racist, misogynistic, bigoted individual to the most important position in the nation. He rejects intellectualism, climate change, and science in general, treating them with suspicion and disdain. How was he even a serious candidate, let alone leader of the free world, given all his moral and intellectual failings as an individual? \n\n\nThis is a man who loves to stoke the fires of hatred, who blatantly lies and dodges questions, a spoiled, self-entitled child who throws tantrums and hurls insults when he doesn't get his way. I am worried about the ramifications of a Trump presidency, with control of Congress and Supreme Court nominations. Same sex marriage could be overturned, Roe vs. Wade might be challenged, climate change initiatives would be suspended, the healthcare system might be in jeopardy.
