It is much, much more than that.\n\nYoga has been practiced for thousands of years, and thousands of years before, say, when Christ was born. Yoga in Sanskrit means union. When you practice yoga, you are practicing bringing the body into full unity with itself, unity between the body and consciousness and, if you want to go the full monty, unity between body, consciousness, and God.\n\nBut if you're not inclined to believe in God, that's fine. Just practicing yoga and mindfulness can be extremely beneficial in your life. Yoga will not only make you more flexible, it opens up your airways and improves cardio, it improves strength without the use of weights, it improves circulation of blood through your vessels and it will help teach you how to move through problems in life like dealing with stress, anger, and other emotions that we get wrapped up in.\n\nIn practicing yoga, you will experience your body being able to move and function in ways you never knew were possible, which I guess may not seem interesting to the Frito gnawing, mountain dew guzzling, I-live-in-my-moms-basement-playing-video-games-all-day, neckbeard stereotypes that tend to this subreddit, but you should never throw out the idea that it is vastly beneficial to your body and mental health just because our society thinks it's something only for women or that you have to believe in God to practice.\n\nGive it a try sometime.", "id": "d77xfes"}, {"comment": ">since the 60's\n\nyoga has been a thing since before 29**60's** (BC) -- some scholars even estimate it's 10,000 years old.", "id": "d78ahk7"}, {"comment": "Aleister Crowley was writing about yoga in the 1930s, if not earlier.

But all were shocked when the priest went on an extended rant, lasting the better part of an hour, about how this sinner was going to Hell, in no uncertain terms.\n\nIt was suggested that after the fact, the priest was summoned by his bishop to explain himself, and he did, receiving only a minor verbal reprimand.", "id": "d8vv5dc"}, {"comment": "Source?", "id": "d8vuxcv"}, {"comment": "Just believe it dude", "id": "d8vv76b"}], [{"comment": ">Me?

Go out and meet people means that you there are locations that you can meet people that have similar interests as you, which depending on your city/state/country can be quite hard. I use my own town as an example since it falls into an extreme. My town doesn't have much on the surface since most of what you can do is either drinking or church related, and if you don't find either of thous enjoyable(even less so by oneself) you will find it hard to go out and meet people, I got lucky since I had made a few friends in high-school and college that shared a similar socializing tendances(ways of getting a hold of each other i.e. cellphones, sykpe,sometimes email) and that brings in one of the most important part of friend making is luck.

Nor do you fully explain why you are so bent out of shape over the fact that by making this rage comic this person was  in fact reaching out to others who feel like them. Hell I'd say the maker of the rage comic understands full well that effort needs to be a part of finding friends, and clearly is looking in the right place since at least a few people have at least reach out to someone who is in the same boat. Truth be told you give off the feeling of someone who has heard this alot from some one, but they are either as you say not putting in the effort or, what most of the time happens, you simply only have a limited view of who they are and the environment that they are in. Or you could also just be a preson purely blinded by their own nature and success.

While yes I can understand it in certain scenarios, but it should be inherently part of how a person interacts with others, even if it is for a few minutes thous few minutes of kindness can sometimes mean the life or death of another human being, and sure while there is an over abundance of human life, that doesn't mean we should consider the loss of our \"humanity\" as a positive especially with the true fact of the insignificance of all life on this planet. I guess I look at cruelty as pure weakness of one's will, the inability to look past yourself, and see that every person you meant has about the same amount of thoughts, feelings and emotions as you have going on in you right now, much like how one looks up at the stars and knows that each one has it's own solar system orbiting it just like our own.

There is no one who can save you from \"learned hopelessness\" but yourself. And it's hard. But there is no magic cure, no panacea, and you won't get better or have your problems fixed by anyone's effort but your own.\n\nThe first step is making an effort to make a friend, if that friend needs to be a therapist, so be it.

I'd agree it wasn't that hard of wording but again it's still just you basically calling them an idiot.

Sometimes the light tap works, sadly this isn't the scenarios where it works. I know from experience that these kinds of scenarios need a helping hand instead of just a disinterested and wave.

I started working 10-12 hour days, busting my ass to impress everyone. I ended up getting an amazing amount of recognition in the 6000+ company I worked for. People would thank me for finally bringing transparency to the orgamization and people would go wild when they would see me at our different buildings. I was hired at a much lower salary for what I was doing and was promised a higher level salary very soon but as things progress, I noticed that the promise was empty and that my boss had secret plans to give the higher paying job to an inexperienced woman he was probably banging or they wanted to use her as a puppet. I became enraged when I finally got the truth out of him and raised some crazy hell, which all ended up ostracising me from the organization. I found out the whole place was corrupt rotten from the top to the bottom. My dreams were shattered and I ended up back in depression and anxiety. My back pain became significantly worse. I lost a startup that had investors when I was between jobs because of the lie, even though I repeatedly told my boss about it and he promised the higher salary. Anyway.

They're evidence that the problem is often yourself and not your circumstance or environment. They enjoy simple things that you don't. You can tell yourself you have superior taste and are more discerning or whatever, but that doesn't really change the fact that they're having fun and you're not.\n\nThe charm of Spongebob, at least in the early seasons, is that they bring Squidward into their world sometimes, and Squidward clearly needs it. There's the episode(Squidville) where Squidward ends up in a town full of Squidwardly characters and it drives him nuts eventually. \n\nEdit: Also, there's the comedic element of Squidward's annoyance but I think even more interesting is his difficulty admitting enjoyment of simple things or refusal to try them until goaded into things by Spongebob. And that is very true to real life, 'cause uh... some people get like that - so committed to being sour, dismissive, cynical that they refuse to let themselves have any fun and they need to be snapped out of it. I've certainly been there. ", "id": "czfmgtw"}, {"comment": "Good review. \n\nThough I still stand by the fact that they really are just a bit naive, not annoying. Sometimes they're really pushy (like forcing Squidward to enjoy a Krabby Patty) but at the same time near the middle of the episode even Spongebob accepts that he doesn't have to like them and says \"We all don't have to like the same things. And while I strongly disagree with your opinion, I accept it!\"\n\nIn newer ones Squidward's house will be invaded on a daily basis, he runs from the two idiots all day, and no matter how much he says no they just chase him around with their dumb-as-bricks personality they seem to have now a days. The difference is that they antagonize him and harass him and he gets punished for it painfully. In older episodes that just was never the case. Even in the one where they kidnap him and take him jellyfishing (Firmly grasp it in your hand!) they get punished at the end of the episode when Squidward releases a jellyfish to attack them. In the newer ones they'd get away scott free.", "id": "czfo3ic"}, {"comment": "Being naive and having the kind of bouncy energy and positive attitude Spongebob has *can* be annoying to *certain people* is my point.

Everything we own has planned obsolescence and can just be replaced, and we tend to adopt the same attitude with marriage.  So we get married until the honeymoon is over, then divorce and repeat, never realizing that it's a reinforcing loop.\n\nBecause we view marriage as disposable, we feel no incentive to put significant effort into the marriage, which causes the marriage to go into the tank.  Sometimes being in love and married is easy.  Sometimes it's not.  Being willing to put in the work when it's not easy is what makes the difference.", "id": "d5kbi3n"}, {"comment": "Which begs the question though.... is marriage itself obsolete?\n\nI mean we come from hunter-gatherer groups in which there was no marriage, sex just happened and the females took care of the young while the males provided.\n\nThen marriage was instituted as a tribal 'treaty' sort of, where I make a pact with you by giving you my daughter to your son, and we are now bound by family.\n\nThat's where it came from. I have to ask is it still relevant today? I'm not one to follow social conventions just because everyone else is, or because \"that's the way it's always been done\".\n\nAnd thank you for your insightful response! I totally get the disposable concept there; I just took it in the other direction.\nAlso, may I ask your gender, age, and marital status?\nThank you.", "id": "d5kcrzf"}, {"comment": "Marriage evolved as a social construct because it was beneficial for society to formalize those relationships.  It wasn't merely tribal treaties, but also having a pact between spouses made it less likely that the provider husband up and abandons the caregiver wife and kids, which meant the tribe was less likely to die off.\n\nAlso, by supporting monogamous relationships, the risk of spreading infections is reduced.  I don't know if early societies figured that out, but it wouldn't surprise me if they did.  After all, they figured out that moldy bread helped heal wounds.\n\nI don't think marriage is as relevant today from a health standpoint, but from a societal cohesion standpoint, I think it's absolutely critical.\n\nThere is a strong correlation between single parent households and juvenile delinquency.  That may have less to do with the absence of the parent and more to do with absence of the increased economic stability that comes from having a two parent household.  Nevertheless, the research is clear that children in dual-parent households tend to do better in life.\n\nEven if children are excluded from the analysis, I think marriage still has a place.  Yes, all of the most obvious benefits of marriage can be had outside of marriage.  You can use tinder to get laid.  You can get a roommate to save money on housing.  You can share the burden of caring for children if you did have them (with each other or otherwise).  But what you lack there is stability.\n\nIt's like the difference between a renting and owning a home, or between being a contractor and being an FTE.  Without the \"vows\" there is nothing binding you together other than your choice to be bound together at that particular moment, and if in the next moment you decide otherwise, \\*poof\\* off you go.  The institution of marriage straddles the line between Safety/Security and Love/Belonging in Maslow's Hierarchy.  Without the commitment, it's difficult for a party to the relationship to feel secure, and that feeling is important for our overall well-being.\n\nI would argue that while technology makes the world \"smaller\", it has also had the impact of isolating us from those around us.  Here I am talking to you, some unknown person from who knows where about a significantly deep subject, but if I'm honest, I don't have many friends \"in real life\".  Tinder may get someone laid, but does it foster meaningful interpersonal relationships?  Not particularly.\n\nI wouldn't say that marriage and deep, meaningful relationships are congruent, as it's certainly possible to have deep, meaningful relationships while unmarried, or with people other than one's spouse, and it's certainly possible for spouses to not have a deep, meaningful relationship (especially given the developments in society's attitudes toward marriage over the last several decades).

You are attracting low self esteem girls this way.  \n\nAnother example:  \n\n* Be fat and a depressed = You walk, act and talk bad = What girls don't like, because they don't like bad feelings.\n* Be fat and laughing (despite depression) = You walk and act confident and fake laugh = Most Girls see a teddy bear who understands feelings\n* Be slim and depressed = You'll attract bitches and be stuck with short relationships\n* Be slim and smiling = You'll attract bitches set onto your money (might even marry to get it)\n\nPoint is: Women act on feelings and will find reasons for it. Play their game to control it. It sounds bad, but women really seek for security. When you make them feel secure, they will stick to you.  \n\nFinally, look up \"The 7 laws of Hermes\". It looks like spiritual bullshit first, but these rules simply describe our existence. Get yourself ordered, watch out how these rules fold out in real life, and fall in love over and over again with her. It's natural to not love each other for a while - just to fall in love again. Look up these laws.", "id": "d4cqe27"}, {"comment": "So what you're saying is: Be a jolly fat man!", "id": "d4dn6r5"}, {"comment": "Almost. I'm still tweaking around the details. My guess is, having a small belly is about perfect. Muscles are nice for bitches to bitch about and confidence, but they're not as good for cuddling as a small belly for a girl to grab into. Keep smiling, become happy, send out being happy and not giving a fuck about not being perfect. You give her confidence by that for free. \n\nSome more random advice that worked for me, a previously VERY fat depressed basement dweller with no friends IRL at all: \n\n* Try /r/keto to get slim. Gets your blood works right and your fat down - by eating bacon, meat and sick breakfasts. Keep a daily diet diary via online food apps. \n* Do sports in the gym and get yourself to at least 2 sessions per week, each 1-2 hours, get at least half an hour of cardio training (at least!!!).  \n* Listen to music while training. Understand training is about switching off your brain from EVERYTHING. You and that crosstrainer are what matters. Everything else is whatever. Try watching episodes on your phone while training for long sessions, so learn to convert those for your phone.  \n* /r/howtonotgiveafuck \n* Listen to \"Wear sunscreen\" or read the text it's based on at least once\n* You are your own nemesis, or god. Whatever you want to be.", "id": "d4hoqm7"}, {"comment": "> Go train in that area however you can and you will magically succeed.\n\nHey, I love your comment. Is there a source where I can read more about this? I saw the seven laws of Hermes online and couldn't find exactly what you were talking about. Any suggestions?", "id": "d4cqqqh"}, {"comment": "The laws are written down [here](http://www.puramaryam.de/lawhermes.html) for example. Ignore the spiritual stuff surrounding it. Spirituality seems like a vehicle to me for these things. The content, however, mostly works out.  \n\nThe other thing has either a [low background](http://i.imgur.com/PmxD4.jpg) or a large, [almost scientific background](http://www.laddertheory.com/). Basically to get a girl - and this applies to getting sex as a married guy with the wife as well - become a man worth it. Understand how she works (read the first link of this post) and how dating actually works (second link, not mandatory though). \n\nI am a very fucking happy puppy with my girl. Two and a half years after our first kiss we still fall in love with each other. I started as a depressed neet before meeting her. Get your shit together, start training and just pretend to be the guy you want to be. Just like with presentations, almost nobody notices you're nervous.\n\nBut I think love is outside of all these games. It's natural. But to get it, you need to be able to see it, reach out for it, grab and hold onto it. But it's a natural thing and therefore swings in an out (hermes laws). If you stick to it too hard, you'll remove the energy the love needs to swing back to you. It can get stronger by swinging more - just like on a playground swing. Want more love? Be ready to drop it temporarily. Trust.\n\n...yeah, these \"spiritual laws\" aren't so stupid as one might imagine. After all, they describe and don't force.\n\n\n**EDIT:** Also one thing reddit told me: What other people think of you **is not your fucking business**.", "id": "d4cr25h"}, {"comment": "Welcome to the married club", "id": "d4cbumo"}, {"comment": "This isn't normal.

However, there is no way to remotely attack thousands or hundreds of thousands of houses simultaneously, so you only have to worry about burglars that are physically present.\n\nWith computer security, that whole equation is inverted. Your biggest threats are from remote attacks and fishing social engineering targeting your employees. You control your facility, presumably you also control access to the rooms where these computers are, and as such the threat of a Chinese hacker walking into the building and sitting down at an open computer is extremely low compared to the threat of some sort of remote attack. \n\nLocking the screen basically only protects the computer from other people who already have physical access to the computer...

Hot dissolves powder detergent better, and kills bacteria. Especially true for towels. Those spend a third of the day (or more) wet, so it's a great place for mold to grow.\n\nDelicates separate because they can entangle/tear.\n\nStained clothes generally get cold washed. Hot water denatures proteins, making it harder to remove. *Never* hot wash clothes with blood, unless you want the stain to be permanent.\n\nDenims are up to personal choice.

If you do not have any romantic feelings or at least any sort of belief that the relationship might go somewhere, then that should be mentioned. Of course not hearing from someone within 24 hours is going to lead us to believe that you want nothing to do with us, because it shows where we stand in your life at that time. Not important enough to send a quick \"sorry, I was busy, I'll get back to you when I can.\" while you're shitting or something. It basically says \"sorry, you didn't come to mind a single time today, but maybe tomorrow I'll think about you and consider responding to you.\"", "id": "czsmsb0"}, {"comment": "A 30 second text with some people very, very quickly turns into them blowing your phone up with 40 texts an hour.

Just a crush, but not dating or anything? No problem. I understand I'm not top of their priorities. Hell, I prefer people who spend time with their friends/family instead of looking at their phone all the time and juggling bunch of lukewarm relationships with it. \n\nStarted dating? Rude if its happens constantly, but I also dont expect him to be available all the hours of the day. I will accept explanations like :\"By the time I saw your message, it was already so late and I didnt' want to bother you. And I forgot to asnwer in the morning.\" Or \"I saw your message in the morning, but I was tired and went back to sleep and forgot to answer.\" etc etc\n\nLong term relationship? By this time I should know what kinda asnwering/messaging habits this guy has and what is just normal for him and what is avoiding me.

You just have busy days sometimes. And I personally relax from those by being alone and recharging. \n\nBut the short answers afterward dont sound very encouraging. Unless ofcourse you either badgered her with texts during the day. It gets really annoying when you receive texts throughout the day.
