[Uri Simonsohn](http://datacolada.org/2016/03/03/47/) over on datacolada did a nice write up on how Gilbert et al. misused CI's to over estimate the number of studies that should replicate - and the OSC paper made the same mistake with CI's, underestimating the number of studies. It's not really fair to level critique at one but not the other. \n\nI agree with you that over interpreting the OSC results one way or the other is not good practice. One of Gilbert's biggest concerns is good scientific communication to the general populace. While yes this paper is somewhat statistically invalid, I don't believe that should take away from the larger message that Gilbert really cares about and that the RPP authors actually agree with - the OSC is not proof that psychology is a failed science in crisis. There are important reasons some of these replications failed that actually contribute to our understanding of psychology rather than detract from it - the \"hidden moderator\" argument. Psychology is bloody hard to model well the first time around, after all, because of how complex the human mind is. And just because something didn't successfully replicate doesn't mean it failed. Back in August [Alex Etz](http://alexanderetz.com/2015/08/30/the-bayesian-reproducibility-project/) looked at the OSC results from a Bayesian perspective rather than a dichotomous succeed/fail viewpoint and showed that while only 34% of studies replicated at least moderately convincingly and 38% accepted the null at least moderately convincingly, there's that 28% in there that just can't be interpreted one way or the other. Not awesome, but not as catastrophic as a lot of the media/journal editors/policy makers etc. have played it out to be - especially considering that this doesn't say anything about psychology in general, only the ability of the chosen set of original studies to predict the results of the current set of replications. As Gilbert and Nosek both attest, this ability is affected by sampling and methodological differences to some degree. \n\nIn summary, I think the more important part of this critique is about how the OSC results are interpreted, and less about the exact numbers that come out of it. E.g. what does \"replication\" mean to us for practical and theoretical purposes, is it a natural part of the scientific process or a diagnosis of poor research, what does it teach us about the psychology versus the people doing the psychology, etc. Gilbert thinks Nosek et al. should have been more careful in their characterization of replication, Nosek doesn't think so, but both of them agree that this isn't a death kiss to the validity of psychology unlike what much of the world has taken it to be. \n\nFor the curious, Nosek wrote a [reply to this reply](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/1037.3.full), and Gilbert wrote another [reply to the reply to the reply](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/psychology-replications/files/gkpw_response_to_osc_rebutal.pdf?m=1457031863). \n", "id": "d0nm8ix"}, {"comment": "You seem informed, I want to know your thoughts on one idea I've seen floating around.\n\nThe idea is that \"soft\" sciences, like psychology, often promote better scientists than \"hard\" sciences do. The reasoning is simple--soft sciences are so incredibly difficult to work in that they *must*, by their very nature of complexity, require extreme rigor that comes from a mastery of understanding the scientific method.\n\nWhereas in hard sciences, they are easier to do, because everything to work with is more concrete and straightforward, and relative to soft sciences, it doesn't require the same mastery of understanding scientific method and requiring as much rigor.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that if you have a choice between studying and experimenting and testing chemistry or psychology, then chemistry is going to be easier to produce reputable, falsifiable, concrete results. But if you chose psychology, you'd need to be more familiar with the scientific method and you would need to be more intelligent in order to produce results of the same caliber.\n\nI don't buy into this idea.

Soooo many things go into being a good scientist, and what makes a good scientist in one field is different than from another. Between me and a chemist, for example, I suck hardcore at the math they need to do for their spectral series and so forth. But I'm really good at working with large sets of very messy data. (well, relatively, being just a grad student right now). I think there are differences in what makes research high caliber between the fields as well, so it's not fair to compare how \"good\" a psych study is to how \"good\" a chem study is. \n\nAnd I'd actually say psychology is less rigorous, because of how difficult it is. There are an unimaginable number of variables that effect human behavior. At the level of a molecule, there are fewer. In chem you can estimate true parameters and create very precise equations, whereas in psychology there are many more parameters as well as this huge error term to account for everything you can't think of. So there are many more degrees of freedom in your research. This means psychologists can make many more subjective decisions. Like, there are very few ways to get gas to change temperature - change its pressure or its volume. That's under ideal conditions granted so it's not that simple, but it's still much simpler than accounting for all the reasons a person might express prejudice in this particular condition. So if you want to raise a gas' temperature, you have a couple options. If you want to manipulate prejudice, there are many more potential ways (some of which might actually be the same, or simply correlated with the effect). Whether those research design decisions are correct to make or not is always a matter of theoretical discussion, but to me rigor means strict adherence to a standard protocol and there's very little standardization in psychology. \n\n", "id": "d0np4p9"}, {"comment": "The much larger degrees of freedom in psychology certainly makes replication harder, but that doesn't invalidate research.

But more over and I think your original point is lack of replication is not bad in its self. If it's due to poor quality of experiment relative to others that is one thing, but if say something about psychology experimentation fails to control for a critical factor the only process to find what that is to do psychology experiments.

A big part of this is the enormous egos of the people who created it. Additionally, the fact that a lucrative cottage industry sprang to life around administering the test only threw gasoline on the fire that was its unfortunate propagation. I think this unabashed self-assuredness and outrageous profitability is one of the central (and rightfully so) reasons why any conversation concerning MBTI immediately finds itself steeped in deep controversy.\n\n\nHear me out. I think the MBTI actually has educational value in some of its deeper components, namely the function stacks. MBTI encouraged me to read Carl Jung's work, and helped me learn a lot of the potential problems and self-biases that can crop up surrounding the administration of tests such as these. If Freud can have any educational value regardless of some of his more outlandish theories, I don't see why a serious examination of Myers-Briggs should be completely out of the question for any engaged, critical student of Psychology. \n\n\nHowever, it's also important to understand why MBTI is so dangerous and largely problematic for the average individual. Most people never dive deeper into the background of the model. Instead, they take the test and read their **psychological fortune cookie soundbite profile**. After, they try to self-perpetuate this bizarre cardboard cutout of themselves into their everyday (usually corporate) lives, which is obviously unhealthy. Even so, this article is stupid and clickbaity, and /r/Psychology should be ashamed of themselves for upvoting it. There isn't a single claim about Myers-Briggs in that article backed up with evidence. It's just \"It's wrong. It's bad. It's useless.\" Why? I'm not defending MBTI. Quite the contrary, I only think it's important to understand why it's so bad so we can be rid of it.\n\n>One obvious trait that the MBTI has in common with horoscopes is its tendency to describe each personality type using only positive words.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. I've read several MBTI profiles with negative traits listed.\n\n>The most obvious flaw is that the MBTI seems to rely exclusively on binary choices\u2026.For example, in the category of extrovert v introvert, you\u2019re either one or the other; there is no middle ground.\n\nMBTI tests would claim they've addressed this issue by using percentage averages or likert scales in their tests. \n\n>I personally feel it\u2019s more to do with people\u2019s tendency to go for anything that offers an easy solution. People will always go for the new fad diet, the alternative remedy, the five dollar wrinkle trick that makes dermatologists hate you for some reason. For all that it may be well-intended, the MBTI offers a variation on that. People are very complex, variable and unpredictable. Many users of the MBTI believe that a straightforward test can simplify them to the point where they can be managed, controlled and utilised to make them as efficient and productive as possible. It\u2019s no wonder businesses are keen to embrace something like that; it would be the ideal tool if it were guaranteed to achieve this.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the only truly valuable takeaway from the article. It's sad that it had to go through everything else to get here. "], [104, "I recently started working for a company that has been using MBTI for decades. Even the psychologist in HR in charge of the programme admitted that, scientifically speaking, it is bullshit. \n\nIt still \"works\". When a department takes the tests, and sit down and talk through what the different types mean, they end up with a greater awareness and acceptance of different ways of thinking, deciding, and working. Extraverts stop forcing introverts to meetings all the time, and introverts realise that the extraverts aren't stupid - they're just speaking their minds early. People who notoriously disagree suddenly realise it might not be that the other person is wrong, but that they achieve results in very different ways. \n\nSure, you might arrive at the same effects by any made-up-model that happens to relate to common workplace personality conflicts. Horoscopes or whatnot. MBTI was designed for the workplace, though, and seems particularly well-suited for this.\n\nSome of MBTIs flaws from a scientific point of view are strengths when you use it in HR. For example: there is no (subjectively speaking) \"bad result\" in MBTI. You can certainly get a bad result in the Big Five tests: would you hire someone with 0 in agreeableness or conscientiousness? Max Neuroticism?

It helps people understand each other, even each profile isn't fully accurate. \n\n16personalities.com does a good job of this and if it leads people to have a better understanding of the wide scope of human behavior, that's some meaningful shiz right there."], [5, "[removed]"], [7, "I have read Jung, I spent years trying to see if there's some relevance to reality in cognitive functions and MBTI types - I have failed miserably. It is entirely subjective, the guy writes to intentionally hide the fact that there is little basis for anything he proposes. He claims that since the mind is mysterious and unknown, he should write in a convoluted manner. It's all poppycock.\n\nIf you try to define functions in any tangible sense, the counter is always the no true Scotsman fallacy. The definitions that people accept are often completely ambiguous, with no substance, and never consistent. When people distinguish between a sensor and an intuitive it often comes down to a handful of simple traits/interests (eg. plays sports, is a mechanic, practical vs reads sci-fi books, forgets things, impractical), but it is thought of as this big mysterious preference that is somehow *more* than just a couple of obvious things, the superficiality is denied and suppressed, without it it is left with no actual meaning. And, as a superficial construct it is even worse off."], [5, "The biggest flaw with the MBTI is that it makes claims that only really apply to someone who scores 100% preferences on all four scales, when in reality people are more likely to be closer to 50% on all, and most people are almost certain to have a shaky preference for at least one dimension. That's why the test-retest reliability is so poor. According to the MBTI, your entire personality type changes if you take one step over an arbitrary line. It's also why it's theoretically possible for you to actually answer the questions in a more similar way to someone who ends up scoring the complete opposite type as you than someone who scored the same type. \n\nLet me explain - let's say I score as an INTP and I have two friends, one who also scores as INTP and the other who scores as ESFJ. But let's say I scored 100% preferences for T and P, but only 55% preferences for I and N. Meanwhile, my INTP friend scored 100% preferences for I and N, but only 55% preferences for T and P. And my ESFJ friend scored 55% preferences for all four letters. In this instance, I'm basically a couple different answers away from scoring ESTP, my INTP friend is a couple different answers away from scoring INFJ, and both of us are more similar to the friend who scored ESFJ (but was only a couple different answers away from scoring any other type) than we are to each other.\n\nDespite being classified as the same type as my INTP friend, we are effectively opposite types. We have nothing in common and are in fact both more similar to someone who was classified as the opposite type than we are to each other. None of us is likely to relate to our given type description unless we fall to the Forer effect. And if we took the test again, it is very possible that I will be classified as ESTP, my INTP friend will be classified as INFJ, and my ESFJ friend will also be classified as ESTP. All of which are entirely different types with entirely different descriptions than the types we originally tested as. This would mean that I am now the opposite type of the person I was the same type as yesterday, and the same type as the person I was the opposite type of yesterday.\n\nThis is why the whole concept of types fails miserably, certainly as the MBTI claims to measure it. There is no consistency to any of it. It's entirely arbitrary. What meaning could saying \"My personality type is INTP\" possibly have if my personality might have less in common with the personalities of other INTPs than it does those of some ESFJs, the supposed description of INTPs does not describe me, and I might not even still be an INTP tomorrow if I take the test again?\n\nIn the scenario I described above, we would get much more accurate and meaningful results if we took the NEO-PI-R and found that I was average in extroversion/openness and low in agreeableness/conscientiousness, my INTP friend was low in extroversion, high in openness, and average in agreeableness/conscientiousness, and my ESFJ friend was average across all traits. This is why the Big Five trait system is so much better than type-based systems like the MBTI. It's much less susceptible to swings in results based on mood and it doesn't make extraordinary claims based on arbitrary categorizations. It may be more of a mouthful than just saying you're an INTP, but then again it's also more of a mouthful than saying you're a Scorpio.

Shrugs.\n\nThat makes sense as the MBTI is a textbook example of the Forer effect - it tells you vague positive things that roughly are accurate for most people. It's used in introductory psych classes where people are given random MBTI results and asked how accurate they are, and most people report that they're mostly accurate. \n\nIn addition to that, there's the fact that the test simply measures what you put into it, and what you put into it is what you think of yourself. So if the test asks you something like \"do you prefer to be by yourself or around others?\" and you think you prefer to be by yourself then it will conclude that you want to be by yourself (ie introverted). \n\nIn other words, it just repeats back to you what you've told it about yourself. So it's not surprising that it sounds accurate because it would be odd if you disagreed with your own opinion of yourself. \n\nIt has no measures or checks to rule out the problems with self report, so whereas most personality tests make sure they're measuring your personality rather than your view of your personality, the MBTI is just a purely biased questionnaire into what you think of yourself. You could skip all the questions and just look at the descriptions of the types, pick the one that you think fits you best, and it would be just as accurate and useful.

A big part of this is the enormous egos of the people who created it. Additionally, the fact that a lucrative cottage industry sprang to life around administering the test only threw gasoline on the fire that was its unfortunate propagation. I think this unabashed self-assuredness and outrageous profitability is one of the central (and rightfully so) reasons why any conversation concerning MBTI immediately finds itself steeped in deep controversy.\n\n\nHear me out. I think the MBTI actually has educational value in some of its deeper components, namely the function stacks. MBTI encouraged me to read Carl Jung's work, and helped me learn a lot of the potential problems and self-biases that can crop up surrounding the administration of tests such as these. If Freud can have any educational value regardless of some of his more outlandish theories, I don't see why a serious examination of Myers-Briggs should be completely out of the question for any engaged, critical student of Psychology. \n\n\nHowever, it's also important to understand why MBTI is so dangerous and largely problematic for the average individual. Most people never dive deeper into the background of the model. Instead, they take the test and read their **psychological fortune cookie soundbite profile**. After, they try to self-perpetuate this bizarre cardboard cutout of themselves into their everyday (usually corporate) lives, which is obviously unhealthy. Even so, this article is stupid and clickbaity, and /r/Psychology should be ashamed of themselves for upvoting it. There isn't a single claim about Myers-Briggs in that article backed up with evidence. It's just \"It's wrong. It's bad. It's useless.\" Why? I'm not defending MBTI. Quite the contrary, I only think it's important to understand why it's so bad so we can be rid of it.\n\n>One obvious trait that the MBTI has in common with horoscopes is its tendency to describe each personality type using only positive words.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. I've read several MBTI profiles with negative traits listed.\n\n>The most obvious flaw is that the MBTI seems to rely exclusively on binary choices\u2026.For example, in the category of extrovert v introvert, you\u2019re either one or the other; there is no middle ground.\n\nMBTI tests would claim they've addressed this issue by using percentage averages or likert scales in their tests. \n\n>I personally feel it\u2019s more to do with people\u2019s tendency to go for anything that offers an easy solution. People will always go for the new fad diet, the alternative remedy, the five dollar wrinkle trick that makes dermatologists hate you for some reason. For all that it may be well-intended, the MBTI offers a variation on that. People are very complex, variable and unpredictable. Many users of the MBTI believe that a straightforward test can simplify them to the point where they can be managed, controlled and utilised to make them as efficient and productive as possible. It\u2019s no wonder businesses are keen to embrace something like that; it would be the ideal tool if it were guaranteed to achieve this.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the only truly valuable takeaway from the article.

The definitions that people accept are often completely ambiguous, with no substance, and never consistent.

I think the easiest way to describe the difference between the two would be to say that the tendancy of sensing would be to take the world as you see it.  You want to believe everything is generally black or white, but whatever it is you see, that's it.  You don't feel the need to further question.  You would prefer knowing how a mechanism works, table it in the back of your mind for future reference, and move on.  Which is absolutely a valid way of looking at the world.  Sensing type people can have an incredibly acute sense of beauty or art, but not neccessarily.  I think sensing traits leads to a general love of nature, seeing the beauty of how the world is right now. \n\nThe tendancy of of intuition is much more chaotic.  Even if one is satisfied with \"understanding\" anything in particular, the mind remains open to further understanding.  Instead of simply taking what you perceive and taking it at face value, the mind constantly looks at it from other angles, waiting for new information to integrate into one's perception of the situation.  This can be a blessing and a curse, and one will ultimately realize that by letting the mind fill in a lot of the blanks, one is often wrong about a lot of things.  But surprisingly, the mind is right about a lot of things as well.  \n\nAnyone can work on their \"intuition\", just as anyone can work on their sensing traits.

Everything you have said is meaningless. Go ahead and give a rigorous explanation for what a chaotic tendency is and explain why intuitive types prefer this more than sensor types. How can you imply that sensing traits lead to a love of nature, or seeing beauty (with respect to who? intuitive types?) - This does not make any distinction between the two.\n\nWanting to believe everything is black and white is a dynamic quality, I don't think this is a consistent, measurable trait, it isn't something you can quantify yourself with any kind of objectivity.\n\nHow is this any different than Astrological profiling? You can always say that there is a 'tendency' towards these traits, but if there really was a tendency, it would appear statistically. It is just a get out of jail for free card for when you find evidence against your claim. I can say that we can go outside and play today because the weather has a general tendency (or a preference) for being sunny, and then when it rains - 'oh! well, it's just a preference!'

Take any behavior you can think of and you can assign multiple functions to it. Am I, right now, using Introverted or Extroverted Thinking? Or is actually an intuition function that I'm using right now? You could make a seemingly rational argument for any function, they could all sound quite convincing. So is it just an ambiguous 'general trend' towards one of them? A repressed function?

Who can claim they are an expert in cognitive functions? Is there some kind of test for proficiency - no. There aren't even legitimate definitions for the functions. Ask Jung and he tells you that introverted intuition is 'when an arrow pierces the depths one's subconscious' and spends pages and pages stringing you along, dodging the question trying desperately hard to make it seem like it has meaning, but you just don't understand it yet.

That's why the test-retest reliability is so poor. According to the MBTI, your entire personality type changes if you take one step over an arbitrary line. It's also why it's theoretically possible for you to actually answer the questions in a more similar way to someone who ends up scoring the complete opposite type as you than someone who scored the same type. \n\nLet me explain - let's say I score as an INTP and I have two friends, one who also scores as INTP and the other who scores as ESFJ. But let's say I scored 100% preferences for T and P, but only 55% preferences for I and N. Meanwhile, my INTP friend scored 100% preferences for I and N, but only 55% preferences for T and P. And my ESFJ friend scored 55% preferences for all four letters. In this instance, I'm basically a couple different answers away from scoring ESTP, my INTP friend is a couple different answers away from scoring INFJ, and both of us are more similar to the friend who scored ESFJ (but was only a couple different answers away from scoring any other type) than we are to each other.\n\nDespite being classified as the same type as my INTP friend, we are effectively opposite types. We have nothing in common and are in fact both more similar to someone who was classified as the opposite type than we are to each other. None of us is likely to relate to our given type description unless we fall to the Forer effect. And if we took the test again, it is very possible that I will be classified as ESTP, my INTP friend will be classified as INFJ, and my ESFJ friend will also be classified as ESTP. All of which are entirely different types with entirely different descriptions than the types we originally tested as. This would mean that I am now the opposite type of the person I was the same type as yesterday, and the same type as the person I was the opposite type of yesterday.\n\nThis is why the whole concept of types fails miserably, certainly as the MBTI claims to measure it. There is no consistency to any of it. It's entirely arbitrary. What meaning could saying \"My personality type is INTP\" possibly have if my personality might have less in common with the personalities of other INTPs than it does those of some ESFJs, the supposed description of INTPs does not describe me, and I might not even still be an INTP tomorrow if I take the test again?\n\nIn the scenario I described above, we would get much more accurate and meaningful results if we took the NEO-PI-R and found that I was average in extroversion/openness and low in agreeableness/conscientiousness, my INTP friend was low in extroversion, high in openness, and average in agreeableness/conscientiousness, and my ESFJ friend was average across all traits. This is why the Big Five trait system is so much better than type-based systems like the MBTI. It's much less susceptible to swings in results based on mood and it doesn't make extraordinary claims based on arbitrary categorizations.

Because treatment should map onto the etiology of the condition itself; not just the symptoms.\n\nThe DSM is really no different than a cluster of \"headache disorders\". We classify all people with depressive symptoms as \"depressed\" without any attention geared towards how the symptoms themselves arose in different people. Then we throw similar conceptions/treatments despite likely different developmental trajectories and pat ourselves on the back for it.

Instead, similar cortical tissue is activated using any learned languages, and differentiation would occur naturally through social context.\n\nI have two sources for this.\n\nFirst is my experience with cognition professor Kaiping Peng @ UC Berkeley (at least, I think it was him: cultural psychology was his specialty). He showed us some functional neuroimaging regarding acquired language. In native bilingual speakers (meaning language was acquired early in life due to bilingual parents or a language school) brain activity was similar while speaking either language. BUT, in non-native bilungial speakers (speakers who learned a new language later in life past an age that I don't recall) there were some different areas of the brain at work in processing the language.\n\nIn essence, non-native speakers had different parts of their brain light up, depending on if they used a certain language. Native speakers had most of the same areas lighting up regardless of the language chosen (there are small differences between, say, Mandarin and English because using a language means you adopt the \"personality\" of a language... but that's a study for another time)\n\nSecond is my experience with native speakers. Commonly, they mix in non-English words with their English words unintentionally. As kids, it was really obvious. As adults, it happens less frequently.

After all as an adult I can tell apart many languages that I don't speak, I don't see why a baby wouldn't notice the same differences.\n\nThe localization difference can also be explained if there is a critical period for / weakening of / sagnation of / stabilization of connections in the language learning capacity and adult language learning has to use other mechanisms.\n\nThe mixing up effect can be interpreted to mean that you don't have a switch in your brain to activate only one language or the other, they're always both activating in parallel and you need to actively suppress the output of one of them to speak in a given language.

It's basically a blog. Its main claim comes from an *oncology* nurse, what does that have to do with language acquisition?\n\nThe 12 year number is somewhat arbitrary. Any kind of delay in first language acquisition seems to have subtle impacts on later grammatical ability in the native language. The big source for that would be [Newport (1990)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1401_2/pdf). Newport looks at deaf individuals first exposed to ASL at different ages. Critically, these individuals may have had communicative systems with their families, but those \"homesign\" systems don't qualify as a full language (there's complexity there, if you'd like more info I can source). Anyway, all ASL learners pick up the basic word order, but if you look at more subtle grammatical patterns, the children exposed at a later age have trouble. Children exposed to ASL first at 4-6 years show slightly less grammatical competence than native ASL signers. Children exposed first after 12 years show even worse competence. Similar findings are given for second-language learners.\n\nOf course there's been a lot of work since then. The basic pattern is not disputed to my knowledge. There's a lot of quibbling about at what age do deficits in language learning appear and *why* do the deficits appear. Here's [a more recent paper](http://liberalarts.utexas.edu/frenchitalian/_files/pdf/davidbpdfs/OnEvidence_DBird.pdf). The more recent stuff suggests that similarities between L1 & L2 play a big role in acquisition ability, as does age of acquisition.\n\nEdit: And related to the original topic, I should mention that MANY people in the non-western world grow up multilingual.

Yes, every time we learn a fact or skill the wiring of the brain changes; it\u2019s not as if the information is stored in the pancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does not mean the brain is a blob of clay pounded into shape by experience.\n\n>**Experience does not revamp the basic information-processing capacities of the brain. Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just that, but the verdict was rendered by Woody Allen after he read \u201cWar and Peace\u201d in one sitting: \u201cIt was about Russia.\u201d Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a myth, not just by laboratory studies but by the familiar sight of an S.U.V. undulating between lanes as the driver cuts deals on his cellphone.**\n\n>Moreover, as the psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons show in their new book \u201cThe Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us,\u201d the effects of experience are highly specific to the experiences themselves. If you train people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math puzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing that thing, but almost nothing else. Music doesn\u2019t make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn\u2019t make you more logical, brain-training games don\u2019t make you smarter.

Classical psychedelics are often considered affectively neutral compared to other recreational drugs. They don't have an inherent propensity to produce euphoria so they may be more attractive to non-depressed individuals, who may be less attracted to mood enhancing substances. But, then, the majority of people who use psychedelics also use other recreational drugs.\n\nThere have been some good critiques on these studies. Nesvag et al. (2015) suggested Johansen and Krebs (2015) made a stasticial error over-adjusting for lifetime use of other recreational drugs:\n\n>From the numbers in Table 3 in the paper it is clear that the group of individuals who reported lifetime use of psychedelic drugs had two to three times higher prevalence of all mental health outcomes when not adjusting for lifetime use of other drugs. However, in the logistic regression analyses, correcting for all other types of drugs, the risk for having a mental health problem was not higher among psychedelic drugs users and the rest of the study population. In our view this is a typical example of over adjustment, a common, but relatively basic fallacy in epidemiological research (Rothman and Greenland, 1998).\n\n[The link between use of psychedelic drugs and mental health problems (2015)](http://jop.sagepub.com/content/29/9/1035.full)\n\nHowever this was quickly rebutted by Hendricks (2015):\n\n>Nesv\u00e5g et al. (2015) suggest the analyses by Johansen and Krebs (2015) introduced overadjustment bias by controlling for lifetime other illicit substance use. Although overadjustment typically biases results toward the null (Schisterman et al., 2009), this critique also could apply to the prior study showing positive rather than null effects (Hendricks et al., 2015) as well as to the present analyses. Overadjustment bias can be defined as \u201ccontrol for an intermediate variable (or a descending proxy for an intermediate variable) on a causal path from exposure to outcome\u201d (Schisterman et al., 2009: 488). From this perspective, controlling for lifetime other illicit substance use would represent overadjustment as described by Nesv\u00e5g et al. (2015) in our analyses if lifetime other illicit substance use were a consequence of lifetime classic psychedelic or psilocybin use. Yet, we are unaware of any data indicating that classic psychedelic or psilocybin use is a cause of other illicit substance use. Indeed, the accumulated evidence suggests common factors underlie substance use behavior (e.g. impulsivity and disagreeableness; Iacono et al., 2008; Kotov et al., 2010; Morral et al., 2002; Vanyukov et al., 2012; Verdejo-Garc\u00eda et al., 2008), and as stated in Hendricks et al. (2015), several lines of research indicate that classic psychedelics including psilocybin have anti-addictive effects. In our estimation, failure to control for lifetime other illicit substance use would represent a failure to account for suicide risk factors (i.e. substance misuse and impulsive-aggressive personality characteristics; see Hendricks et al., 2015) that overlap with, but do not appear to be caused by, classic psychedelic or psilocybin use. We therefore hold that inclusion of the aforementioned covariates is appropriate and likely does not introduce overadjustment bias.\n\n[Psilocybin, psychological distress, and suicidality (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4721603/)\n\nIn this study Hendricks further analysed his previous research (second link in my previous post) to identify lifetime use of psilocybin as having the strongest association with improved mental health outcomes. He concludes:\n\n>The current findings demonstrate that the potentially beneficial effects of classic psychedelic use reported by Hendricks et al. (2015) extend to psilocybin use per se. Furthermore, these findings suggest that lifetime use of psilocybin but no other classic psychedelic may be especially protective with regard to psychological distress and suicidality. This finding is consistent with data indicating that psilocybin may have the most favorable safety profile of all classic psychedelic substances (Gable 1993, 2004). Psilocybin in particular may thus hold promise as an innovative mental health intervention and suicide prophylaxis. For other indications for which psilocybin is currently being studied (cancer-related anxiety/depression and addictions; Bogenschutz et al., 2015; Grob et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2014), the present results also address a safety concern. That is, based on the highly sensationalized cultural history of classic psychedelics, some in the public may be concerned that controlled clinical prescription application of psilocybin may increase the risk of suicide. The present data do not provide support for this concern and are consistent with recently renewed clinical research suggesting possible therapeutic applications of psilocybin.\n\nHendricks observations still don't prove causation but they do hint towards it.", "id": "d1pfb22"}, {"comment": "Causation or correlation, who cares, I want to be in the happier group =)", "id": "d1px0p8"}, {"comment": "I'm not disputing that LSD shouldn't be studied more.

Additionally, everything you know is one more thing grounding you to one perception of the world.\n* Relatability. The people with the capacity to genuinely give you new perception are probably going to be very different from you. Surround yourself with people it's easy to relate to and you're just creating an echo chamber.\n\n> (it seems people are reacting negatively to the notion of IQ but make no mistake, it has its importance). ... I am not sure if you are aware of this, but a high IQ person also generally has a high g factor, or general intelligence. IQ is a fairly good indicator of g and of economic success later in life. \n\nI skipped over your mention of IQ as just meaning a person's general intelligence. If you're insisting that IQ specifically is used then I disagree quite a bit. The obvious issue with any IQ-like metric is that it's entirely arbitrary what should be tested, how it should be tested, how it should be scored, how scores should be weighed, etc. So you're saying IQ is a good measure because two other things you arbitrarily decided mean intelligence, g factor and economic success in our society, are good. But what if those don't mean intelligence or, more specifically, what if they only capture a small portion of intelligence? Or what if measures of g factor and economic success bring in substantial bias as well?\n\nIt reminds me of an argument I had a while back about finances. The person I was arguing with was insisting that something along the lines of maximizing your net worth was the smartest thing to do. Meanwhile, I was saying that unspent money does nothing of benefit to you, so a smart person, after establishing a moderate cushion, would be focusing on using that money in ways that unlock its potential in forms that they actually value. Bill Gates once responded to a girl asking how to be as rich as him by saying something like, \"After $100 million dollars, it's all the same hamburger.\" So, with that argument in mind, \"economic success\" might be a reflection of a narrow intelligence (the skills involved in attaining and maximizing money) and a deficiency in other intelligence (understanding the actual value that money has in terms of things you care about). Sure, we could argue that a billionaire could be smart, but we could also argue that somebody who finds a way to survive from the land so they can live among the nature they love and spend more time with their family could be quite smart too. It's not clear why economic success should correlate to intelligence. Perhaps, it's just saying that people with high IQs are more likely to maximize quantitative things than qualitative things, which isn't an objectively smarter or better thing.\n\n> For that reason, I would like to know what you mean by \"smart.\" Is the \"dumb person\" much \"smarter\" than me in certain specific topics due to his intelligence, or is he just more knowledgeable? Perhaps he spent a lot of time on a particular topic that I have not had the time or chance to learn about? In that case, yes, I would have something to learn from him, you are right. And I doubt I'd have an argument with him if I'm completely clueless in his expertise.\n\nIn the context of this conversation, debates, intelligence has to involve perspective, facts and reasoning. It's irrelevant to your point whether he is more \"intelligent\" or more \"knowledgeable\", both matter in debates. It's irrelevant to your point whether he is smarter because \"he spent a lot of time\". Heck, I'd argue it might not even matter if he's right purely by accident; it can still turn into an effective and enlightening debate and might force him to flesh out more legitimate grounding for that point. It's also a recipe for ignorance to insist that the mere fact that you're arguing with him means you are knowledgeable on the topic. It's also an unjustified jump to say that the fact that you aren't \"completely clueless\" means that the other person might not still have an edge on you.\n\n> However, dumb people generally do not even understand the concept of cognitive biases, logical fallacies and the many other flaws of our human brains and fail to recognise that they suffer from them, like all of us. The more intelligent you are, the more you try to stay away from these logical flaws, unless of course you are trying to manipulate someone in which case you embrace these convenient flaws with open arms. \n\nFrom the studies I've read, it doesn't seem that cognitive bias occurs less often in higher IQ individuals. So, I don't agree. For the sake of argument, let's say it did. Saying bias is more likely isn't equivalent to saying you can't learn from them, they can't be genuinely right, etc. It's unnecessary and unjustified to round probabilities to 1s and 0s.\n\n> Perhaps a better rule, rather than \"don't argue with stupid people\" would be: \"don't argue with someone that is too stubborn\"?\n\nPerhaps it's to not limit your discussion approach to the goal of converting people to your side. If you're not tied to changing their mind, then it becomes a lot easier to talk to somebody you really disagree with.\n\n> Is stubbornness not a certain form of stupidity, though? \n\nNot necessarily. A mind where all parts are 100% likely to change would have no intelligence or way to \"protect\" information. A mind where all parts are 0% likely to change would have no way to learn or refine. So, any well functioning mind is going to be somewhere in the middle of the two. The fact that humans start out closer to the former and move along more to the latter reflects how it's useful for an intelligent mind to have a little bit of each. Being closer to the latter is really just raising the burden of proof. That could make it hard for legitimate things to be accepted, but obviously has advantages as well.\n\nI mean, you could argue that the scientific method is a process of making us more \"stubborn\" about the information we admit into this \"intelligence\" called science.", "id": "d7js17w"}, {"comment": "Are you sure it's their \"two-digit IQ\" that is the problem?", "id": "d7jhep4"}, {"comment": "It isn't, you are right.

The Relation Between Spatial Cognition, Social Cognition and Individual Differences in the Built Environment\n\n>Knowing who we are, and where we are, are two fundamental aspects of our physical and mental experience. Although the domains of spatial and social cognition are often studied independently, a few recent areas of scholarship have explored the interactions of place and self. This fits in with increasing evidence for embodied theories of cognition, where mental processes are grounded in action and perception. Who we are might be integrated with where we are, and impact how we move through space. Individuals vary in personality, navigational strategies, and numerous cognitive and social competencies. Here we review the relation between social and spatial spheres of existence in the realms of philosophical considerations, neural and psychological representations, and evolutionary context, and how we might use the built environment to suit who we are, or how it creates who we are. \n\nFrom another section\n\n>We explore whether seemingly different intended usages of the terms egocentric and allocentric are in fact related, in terms of neuroanatomical or behavioral attributes.

ACT would traditionally say that none of the 6 components of the hexaflex is inherently more important as a mechanism of change. The big names in ACT usually call it a \"dance\" as you have to try and figure out where clients are struggling within the hexaflex and then emphasize that piece.

Usually when we do exposure, for instance, we ask for subjective units of distress (SUDS) on a continuum (ranging from 0-10 or 0-100). However, when Hayes asks about a client's *willingness* to engage in exposure, he asks on a scale of 0-1: you're willing, or you're not willing. You can't be \"kind of\" willing. Deep breathing isn't really a \"willing\" behavior because you are saying \"I am not willing to experience this event to its fullest unless I can downregulate it a bit.\"\n\nRather than doing deep breathing, just start at a lower SUDS exposure task all together. That makes far more sense than punching above their weight and coupling it with a safety behavior.\n\n> graded exposure works\n\nBut not as well as other forms (e.g., stimulus switching, doesn't *have* to be flooding).", "id": "d6k2ppu"}, {"comment": "Yeah, the metaphor of jumping off the seat applies here - 'there is no try'.

For instance, you can say that some people are cognitively more oriented towards understanding things in chunks of \"aha\" moments, an accepted phenomenon, while others tend to rely more on linear, logical trains of thought, or feelings and values -- not exclusively, but to degrees on a spectrum.\n\nThink of music theory. There is a reason we talk about the character of different scales and key signatures, and it isn't because those things are scientific fact.

There are aspects of strength building, personality growth/deterioration, personality changes under stress, etc. which change as one goes through life. Let's also not forget the religious/ moral/social beliefs which may affect question answers (my true self thinks A, but I know B is the socially acceptable answer), and these can change over time and gain or lose importance depending on context. To be properly utilized, the test needs to be administered by a professional counselor who specializes in Myers-Briggs, and one needs to take the time to understand the tool they have been given.

If you're going to call yourself a journalist, learn how to do proper research. Stop propagating ignorance.\""], [16, "Anyone who talks about I/E and J/P splits is Doing It Wrong. (This is in fact a good Idiot Test for MBTI critiques. If they talk about these splits as part of their critique, they're an idiot.)\n\nThe MBTI is based on Carl Jung's eight function model of the mind: thinking Ti/Te & feeling Fi/Fe (the judging functions), and intuiting Ni/Ne & sensing Si/Se (the perceiving functions). The theory says that if a person has one of these eight that they use primarily, and then they have a secondary one of the eight that is opposite in i/e (introverted, internal and extroverted, external) orientation and opposite in j/p. So if Se (extroverted sensing) is your primary then Ti or Fi will be your secondary. Under MBTI you would be an ESTP or ESFP; the I or E indicates the i/e orientation of your first function, so that's E in this case; the J or P indicates whether the first Xe function (in this case Se) is Judging or Perceiving.\n\nA better coding mechanism would be Se-Ti or Se-Fi, however sheer inertia means that even those few of us who actually understand the relationship of the function codes to the MBTI codes still use the MBTI codes. Such is life.\n\nThe coding system is confusing and in my view *creates* a lot of the criticism of MBTI. You do not have a percentage of J vs P. What you do have, is a percentage of thought and motivation associated with *each of* the eight different functions. If you spend a lot of your time thinking about the social dynamics of other people, that's Fe. If you spend a lot of your time taking apart theoretical ideas, that's Ti. If you do both, you may be Ni-Fe-Ti-Se (INFJ) or Si-Fe-Ti-Ne (ISFJ). \n\nAccording to the theory you can't be Fe-Ti-something-something or Ti-Fe-something-something, because that's not how a function stack works. For the functions A-B-C-D, if A is Judging then B must be Perceiving, or vice versa. If B is Judging then C must be the other Judging function, but opposite e/i orientation. They will run J1-P1-P2-J2 or P1-J1-J2-P2 and ?e-?i-?e-?i or ?i-?e-?i-?e.\n\nPretty much everyone who understands the theory acknowledges that proving it at a reliable level is *awfully hard*. The strongest prediction it makes is that a person who repeatedly tests as personality type N, and having understood the description of type N accepts and agrees with it, will generally behave in a somewhat similar manner to other persons who also test as type N who also understand, accept and agree with that. Which is massively full of self-selection bias. We already know that. You're not doing us any favours, or making yourself seem any smarter, by pointing this out to us. (\"So why are you pretending it's the gospel truth then? Huh? Huh?\") We don't. It's course peddlers, Facebook quiz writers, HR knob-ends and high-functioning schizophrenics who think that it's the gospel truth. *My* agenda is that personality profiling is something that *you* can think about, and if you accept it, you can use it to understand and improve yourself, and understand and improve your relationships with other people.\n\nAn *example* of types of function-based thought:\n\n> *The Eight Functions and Fence-Building*\n\n> Ne - I want to design the fence.\n\n> Ni - Why do they want to do this and what is the deal with fences anyway? Is this necessary?\n\n> Se - I want to decorate the fence and make sure that it looks stylish and appealing\n\n> Si - I\u2019ll take care of looking at the instructions and making sure that we follow the established guidelines.\n\n> Te - Is doing this cost effective? Will it be useful?\n\n> Ti - I want to analyze the structure and placement of the fence.\n\n> Fe - How will it affect the neighborhood, and what will the neighbors think? \n\n> Fi - I want it to be my own special fence that I can share with others over time\n\nSo, how the MBTI works is, they ask you questions that are intended to elicit your usage of various functions. If you show up as say 50% Ni, 25% Te, 25% other, then you might be an INTJ.\n\nYou also might not. MBTI doesn't have high repeatability, which is a problem with the measuring process. The test is like trying to determine how tall you are by asking you over the phone what types of furniture you remember being able to see over. It's subjective and very, very heavily affected by self-deception and subconscious (or conscious) other-deception if the test is perceived to be used to judge a person's job prospects or other strongly incentivized benefit.\n\nYes you do have all eight functions and yes you can use them all. Will you change your usage pattern enough to show up as a different MBTI? Maybe. We have no idea. Some of us suspect you can (ie it's learned behaviour) some of us suspect you can't (ie it's \"brain wiring\"); there isn't enough coherent evidence either way.

Trying to view someone as a combination of two or three archetypes will do a much better job of modeling the conflicts and perspectives we really experience.\n\nA good list which corresponds the MBTI types to character types is here. Try combining two or more of these types and you've got the start to an interesting character.

The basic descriptions of these categories aren't as clear as they could be, which is why I prefer to bring things back to the basics of first person, second person, third person, and fourth person perspective taking which focuses on either input needs/goals or output needs/goals.  Using some findings by Helen Fisher on brain chemistry and personality, as well as a whole pile of other neuroscience research (including [Dario Nardi's  brain scanning work](http://www.darionardi.com/)), and some basic math, I've come up with a more clear and robust way of describing these basic personality functions/preferences... \n\nFirst person awareness is governed by dopamine and the brain stem and central nervous system of the body, and defines our physical state as it reflects our ability to get our needs met.  \n\nSecond person awareness is governed by estrogen and the limbic system, and defines our emotional state as it reflects the ability of the ability of the individual person/place/thing that we are closest to at the moment being able to physically get their needs met.\n\nThird person awareness is governed by testosterone and the primary cortex, and defines our intellectual state as it reflects the ability of the larger community/environment around us at the moment being able to physically get it/their needs met.\n\nFourth person awareness is governed by serotonin and the prefrontal cortex, and defines our philosophical/spiritual/moral state as it reflects our understanding of the state/goals of the universe as a whole.\n\nThese four levels of attention in the brain can be focused on the past/input-needs, in the sense of noticing what is lacking and what the individual wants to get/have, or they can be focused on the future/output-needs, in the sense of noticing what is overabundant and what the individual wants to give/express.\n\nEveryone always has a little bit of everything, but at the core of each of us there is a *basic* combination of nature and nurture that leads us to have an overall preference for certain ways of paying attention to life.  Those preferences can also be labeled:\n\nFirst person input focus: Introvert\n\nFirst person output focus: Extravert\n\nSecond person input focus: Sensing\n\nSecond person output focus: iNtuiting\n\nThird person input focus: Feeling\n\nThird person output focus: Thinking\n\nFourth person input focus: Judging\n\nFourth person output focus: Perceiving\n\nIf this categorization approach doesn't seem useful to you, that's fine.

My own goals involve helping people be more awesome by exploring what they most want to do in life, and how they can use their unique sets of skills, abilities, interests, and so on to achieve their greatest, most effective, creative, useful, and fun dreams, and so I've found these categories very useful in making maps for myself and others.

And the brain structures themselves grow over time, as well, and keep developing/changing well into old age.

What a normal distribution means is that the majority of people are neither introverts or extroverts, but rather, somewhere in the middle, or literally, they are neither. Because of this, the MBTI's implication that you have a \"type\" is likely false. Why? To make that claim, one would expect that the distribution of introverts and extroverts is bimodal. In other words, if you drew a graph, there would be two \"peaks\" representing the two \"types\". This is not what happens in reality. Most people are neither introverted or extroverted. \n\nTo expand further, we can take a real world example: Height is normally distributed.

Would you be comfortable splitting the population down the middle and saying everyone below 170cm (let's just pretend this is the average) is short, and every above is tall?

Myers-Briggs is pretty much straight Jung, plus a lot of research data and a bit of continuation of Jung's ideas.  The stuff that nearly everyone in the popular personality type communities on Reddit and elsewhere on the internet (e.g., 16personalities.com) have tried to *interpret* what Myers-Briggs and Jung and others have theorized, and in many cases mucked it up horribly.

Validity is not an element of a test, but specifically has to do with test score interpretation. (see the Standards for Educational and Psychological testing 1999, or Messick, 1989). That being said, the Myers Briggs is not a scientifically valid personality assessment. However, personality assessments can be validated for specific purposes.\n\n>Moving onto the bigger issue with the Myers-Briggs: Decision consistency. The Myers-Briggs proclaims a reliability (calculated using coefficient alpha) of between .75-.85 on all of its scales (see Myers-Briggs testing manual). These are general, industry standard reliability coefficients(indicating that if you were to retest, you would get a similar score, but not exact). However, the Myers-Briggs makes additional claims about bucketing individuals into 1 of 16 possible personality types. That you can shift up or down a few points if you were to retake the test on any of the four distinct scales means that you may be higher on one scale than another simply through retaking the test due to measurement error. **In fact, literature shows that your personality type will change for 50% of individuals simply through retesting.** (Cautionary Comments Regarding the Myers-Brigg Type inventory, Consulting Psychology Journal: Practice and research, summer, 2005). This result indicates very low decision consistency. The low decision consistency is also a mathematical inevitability given 16 personality profiles using 4 scales and scale reliability around .8.\n\n>Given the low decision consistency, and given that claims the Myers-Briggs makes about about your personality(validity information) depends on the decisions made by the test to be consistent and not subject to change simply based on retesting, it is highly unlikely that there can be a solid validity argument supporting the Myers-Briggs as a personality indicator. Maybe there are studies showing that it can be used in a very specific context, but sweeping generalizations about the tests use are not going carry much weight.\n\n>Now, as a working professional in the field, the Myers-Briggs does NOT have a good reputation as being a decent assessment. It has marketed well to school systems and has good name recognizability, but it is not a well developed exam. There are much better personality assessments available, such as SHL's OPQ32 or The Hogan personality inventory. Now, I don't want to say any of these are good. The best correlations between job performance and personality assessments is about .3 (indicating about 9% of the variance in a persons job performance can be accounted for by a personality assessment). That is the BEST personality assessments can do in terms of job performance... and a correlation of .3 is not worth very much (considering that tests like ACT or the SAT can correlate upwards of .7 with first year college GPA under ideal circumstances).\n\nThe part bolded is my own emphasis on what is most wrong with the MBTI. I have no qualms about people taking it for fun to find their own \"type\" of people and if they think it fits them to a tee so be it, but it shouldn't be treated as if it was scientific gospel. \n", "id": "czwz96p"}, {"comment": "I may actually have something interesting to say on the matter. \n\nLast year I took a class with one of the developers of the HEXACO personality model, which has shown some statistical improvements over the Big Five.

Context and other factors are always more important than personality for anything, be it school or workplace performance, relationship success, etc. \n\nWhat did seem to be important were two implications of the tests. \n1. Group behaviour. A large group of conscientious workers will be better than a large group of unconscious workers. \n2. Personality development and change. What, in general, causes people to become who they are and under what conditions is this stable or unstable. This is what I think is the more important factor. It may surprise you to hear that personality is correlated with biological factors almost entirely, with parental contribution being almost negligible outside of severe abuse.

(This is in fact a good Idiot Test for MBTI critiques. If they talk about these splits as part of their critique, they're an idiot.)\n\nThe MBTI is based on Carl Jung's eight function model of the mind: thinking Ti/Te & feeling Fi/Fe (the judging functions), and intuiting Ni/Ne & sensing Si/Se (the perceiving functions). The theory says that if a person has one of these eight that they use primarily, and then they have a secondary one of the eight that is opposite in i/e (introverted, internal and extroverted, external) orientation and opposite in j/p. So if Se (extroverted sensing) is your primary then Ti or Fi will be your secondary. Under MBTI you would be an ESTP or ESFP; the I or E indicates the i/e orientation of your first function, so that's E in this case; the J or P indicates whether the first Xe function (in this case Se) is Judging or Perceiving.\n\nA better coding mechanism would be Se-Ti or Se-Fi, however sheer inertia means that even those few of us who actually understand the relationship of the function codes to the MBTI codes still use the MBTI codes. Such is life.\n\nThe coding system is confusing and in my view *creates* a lot of the criticism of MBTI. You do not have a percentage of J vs P. What you do have, is a percentage of thought and motivation associated with *each of* the eight different functions. If you spend a lot of your time thinking about the social dynamics of other people, that's Fe. If you spend a lot of your time taking apart theoretical ideas, that's Ti. If you do both, you may be Ni-Fe-Ti-Se (INFJ) or Si-Fe-Ti-Ne (ISFJ). \n\nAccording to the theory you can't be Fe-Ti-something-something or Ti-Fe-something-something, because that's not how a function stack works. For the functions A-B-C-D, if A is Judging then B must be Perceiving, or vice versa. If B is Judging then C must be the other Judging function, but opposite e/i orientation. They will run J1-P1-P2-J2 or P1-J1-J2-P2 and ?e-?i-?e-?i or ?i-?e-?i-?e.\n\nPretty much everyone who understands the theory acknowledges that proving it at a reliable level is *awfully hard*. The strongest prediction it makes is that a person who repeatedly tests as personality type N, and having understood the description of type N accepts and agrees with it, will generally behave in a somewhat similar manner to other persons who also test as type N who also understand, accept and agree with that. Which is massively full of self-selection bias. We already know that. You're not doing us any favours, or making yourself seem any smarter, by pointing this out to us. (\"So why are you pretending it's the gospel truth then? Huh? Huh?\") We don't. It's course peddlers, Facebook quiz writers, HR knob-ends and high-functioning schizophrenics who think that it's the gospel truth. *My* agenda is that personality profiling is something that *you* can think about, and if you accept it, you can use it to understand and improve yourself, and understand and improve your relationships with other people.\n\nAn *example* of types of function-based thought:\n\n> *The Eight Functions and Fence-Building*\n\n> Ne - I want to design the fence.\n\n> Ni - Why do they want to do this and what is the deal with fences anyway? Is this necessary?\n\n> Se - I want to decorate the fence and make sure that it looks stylish and appealing\n\n> Si - I\u2019ll take care of looking at the instructions and making sure that we follow the established guidelines.\n\n> Te - Is doing this cost effective? Will it be useful?\n\n> Ti - I want to analyze the structure and placement of the fence.\n\n> Fe - How will it affect the neighborhood, and what will the neighbors think? \n\n> Fi - I want it to be my own special fence that I can share with others over time\n\nSo, how the MBTI works is, they ask you questions that are intended to elicit your usage of various functions. If you show up as say 50% Ni, 25% Te, 25% other, then you might be an INTJ.\n\nYou also might not. MBTI doesn't have high repeatability, which is a problem with the measuring process. The test is like trying to determine how tall you are by asking you over the phone what types of furniture you remember being able to see over. It's subjective and very, very heavily affected by self-deception and subconscious (or conscious) other-deception if the test is perceived to be used to judge a person's job prospects or other strongly incentivized benefit.\n\nYes you do have all eight functions and yes you can use them all. Will you change your usage pattern enough to show up as a different MBTI? Maybe. We have no idea. Some of us suspect you can (ie it's learned behaviour) some of us suspect you can't (ie it's \"brain wiring\"); there isn't enough coherent evidence either way. We're still at the \"electricity is what you get by rubbing rabbit fur with amber rods\" level in the scientific investigation of personality.\n\nSome progress in associating areas of brain activity with function-type thought has been made in EEG studies ([Dario Nardi's address to Google engineers](http://youtube.com/watch?v=MGfhQTbcqmA)) however it's mostly been done by the neurologist Dario Nardi as his own project and verification is thin on the ground at this time.\n\nTL;DR: most criticism of MBTI is based on utter misunderstanding of what it is and how it works; this misunderstanding is to a large extent created and perpetuated by (1) the proprietary, money-making-incentivized bullshit surrounding MBTI and its promotion as a HR tool; (2) the stupid coding system that Myers and Briggs thought up; (3) marketers are incentivized to create Facebook quizzes, and very rarely bother to ensure any accuracy in their tests; (4) \"professional psychologists\" who dismiss it contemptuously don't bother investigating it well enough to learn what it is, because they get into the habit of dismissing it contemptuously.", "id": "czwkvth"}, {"comment": "Have you studied much Jung?

But certainly some theories and ways of categorizing things are more useful than other theories and ways for certain goals.", "id": "d04tkfx"}], [{"comment": "How to understand the MBTI personality categories from a more scientific perspective.\n\nIn my research, I've seen that the basic categories are an imperfect, but good first draft, for categorizing the different brain structures/processes of complex, philosophical animals like humans, and how well they are functioning.  The basic descriptions of these categories aren't as clear as they could be, which is why I prefer to bring things back to the basics of first person, second person, third person, and fourth person perspective taking which focuses on either input needs/goals or output needs/goals.  Using some findings by Helen Fisher on brain chemistry and personality, as well as a whole pile of other neuroscience research (including [Dario Nardi's  brain scanning work](http://www.darionardi.com/)), and some basic math, I've come up with a more clear and robust way of describing these basic personality functions/preferences... \n\nFirst person awareness is governed by dopamine and the brain stem and central nervous system of the body, and defines our physical state as it reflects our ability to get our needs met.  \n\nSecond person awareness is governed by estrogen and the limbic system, and defines our emotional state as it reflects the ability of the ability of the individual person/place/thing that we are closest to at the moment being able to physically get their needs met.\n\nThird person awareness is governed by testosterone and the primary cortex, and defines our intellectual state as it reflects the ability of the larger community/environment around us at the moment being able to physically get it/their needs met.\n\nFourth person awareness is governed by serotonin and the prefrontal cortex, and defines our philosophical/spiritual/moral state as it reflects our understanding of the state/goals of the universe as a whole.\n\nThese four levels of attention in the brain can be focused on the past/input-needs, in the sense of noticing what is lacking and what the individual wants to get/have, or they can be focused on the future/output-needs, in the sense of noticing what is overabundant and what the individual wants to give/express.\n\nEveryone always has a little bit of everything, but at the core of each of us there is a *basic* combination of nature and nurture that leads us to have an overall preference for certain ways of paying attention to life.  Those preferences can also be labeled:\n\nFirst person input focus: Introvert\n\nFirst person output focus: Extravert\n\nSecond person input focus: Sensing\n\nSecond person output focus: iNtuiting\n\nThird person input focus: Feeling\n\nThird person output focus: Thinking\n\nFourth person input focus: Judging\n\nFourth person output focus: Perceiving\n\nIf this categorization approach doesn't seem useful to you, that's fine.  It's not a theory of everything, just one of many theories that are useful for some situations and not useful for others.  My own goals involve helping people be more awesome by exploring what they most want to do in life, and how they can use their unique sets of skills, abilities, interests, and so on to achieve their greatest, most effective, creative, useful, and fun dreams, and so I've found these categories very useful in making maps for myself and others.  (For example, this map of how all the different human types fit into a healthy, planetary organization:  [Personality Types - exceptional talents and motivations](https://createspaceearth.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/mbtiprimedirective.gif))\n\nI will also point out that since personality is governed by BOTH nature and nurture, as we grow (experience more nurture), we can change personality-wise, to some extent (within the confines of our genetic range).  The third and fourth person perspectives (intellectual and philosophical levels) are more pliable and can easily change depending on the experiences we have as we mature.  And the brain structures themselves grow over time, as well, and keep developing/changing well into old age.  Somewhat new neuroscience research has shown that the fourth person perspective (the prefrontal cortex) doesn't apparently fully mature until at least around age 40.  So a full perceiving tendency doesn't emerge until middle age for us.", "id": "d04tpyf"}], [{"comment": "This video is pretty dumb.

Another note, the current paradigm of schizophrenia is that it is a neuro developmental disorder, meaning you are born with it and you don't just have a random break and suddenly become psychotic because you had some experience or trauma.\n\nThese researchers may be counting temporary psychotic disorders in thier claims.\n\nEdit: random \"i\""], [16, "Psychosis can certainly occur from severe stress and threats.

This can encourage all kinds of behavioral health problems.\n\nTrauma and stress can also shrink the brain in various other ways- many of which are obvious enough to be picked up on MRI scans."], [5, "Posting as a top level reply: the link between immigrant status and poor psychiatric health is actually pretty well supported in schizophrenia. This is not something limited to black or asian populations, even white immigrants to other countries have a higher incidence of schizophrenia than natives (see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16905294)\nCurrent understanding thus suggests that this increased incidence is due to social factors for multiple reasons (http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/186/5/361 ):\n\n\"The excess risk is not specific for African\u2014Caribbean immigrants (themselves ethnically diverse); it is also present among African-born Black immigrants to the UK, and to a lesser extent among immigrants from Asian countries.\n\nIncidence rates of schizophrenia in Caribbean countries are similar to those found in the indigenous UK population, and much lower than reported rates among immigrants from that region. Morbid risk for schizophrenia in parents and siblings is about the same in those two populations. Yet the rate for schizophrenia in second-generation African\u2014Caribbean people born in the UK appears to be higher than in the first generation, as is also the risk among patients\u2019 siblings. This pattern is strongly suggestive of an environmental rather than a genetic effect.\n\nThere is no evidence for selective immigration from the Caribbean as part of a pre-psychotic segregation or drift process. Indeed, given economic conditions in the 1950s and 1960s, it seems more likely that migration from the West Indies would have been selective for upwardly striving individuals.\n\nAfrican\u2014Caribbean patients with schizophrenia manifest more social handicaps than their counterparts in the indigenous White population. They are more likely to be unemployed, to have a record of convictions, to be resident in decaying inner-city areas, to be living alone, and to have experienced prolonged separation from both parents in early life.\n\nMoreover, the base population from which these patients are drawn is disadvantaged in terms of socio-economic status, educational attainment, employment and housing standards, as well as being subject to racial discrimination. A study of 10-year-old children, conducted in the 1970s, suggested that a high proportion of second-generation Black immigrant children, raised in Britain, were growing up in over-crowded, multiple-occupancy houses; had mothers in full-time unskilled work; were being looked after by unregulated childminders, and had lived apart from one or both parents for more than 1 month (Rutter et al, 1975).

For example, if the English-born husband of a woman in labour insists that she must be excluded from her immediate family and social environment, that she must deliver her child attended only by her mother and that after delivery an animal must be laid upon her abdomen, that for a fill month afterwards she must live apart lest her uncleanliness pollutes and poisons those coming into contact with her, and that she must not for the same reason handle food, but must be fed on the end of a long pole, then such a man will be regarded as deluded, given the contemporary cultural values of British society. However, should such views be held by a Bribri Indian, we would have to refrain from classifying them as delusional in the absence of further information, for such beliefs are part of the common culture and mythology of this tribe and are held not individually or idiosyncratically but collectively.\"\n\nAs to your broader point, the link between immigrant status and poor psychiatric health is actually pretty well supported in schizophrenia.

First of all, obviously it's not that black and white. I know you didn't mean to imply that, but consider the reason why it's not black and white.\n\nThe fact that people with social phobia judge interactions as \"good\" and \"bad\" in the first place is a *huge* part of the problem. Part of being social is realizing that everything is an experience. You either gain an experience that encourages you to do more of the same, or you gain an experience that teaches you about other ways of being. People with social phobia (I'm including myself here) have a highly skewed perception of social reality, and are more likely to see interactions as negative, when in fact healthier people generally see them as neutral, or even positive. Gaming, in general, is often perceived by less socially successful individuals as an easy positive (subconscious, not intellectual judgement) because it has been engineered to trigger the exact specific neural pathways that are pretty much universally desired in individuals, no matter how simplistic those triggers may be.\n\nSocially anxious people,  who are starved for what they see as \"positive\" experiences, are highly suceptible to this sort of triggering, even though falling into the trap of accepting the easy source of positive feelings routinely disallows them from pursuing more realistic experiences in real life, thus further increasing their dependency on quick-fix positive experiences like gaming, entertainment, and food.\n\nThe evidence is in the pudding. Are people bringing a new skill set from this experience that extends past the game? Are people showing a new desire to persevere through adversity toward a larger goal that will effect their lives in a meaningful way, or are they just finding another dependence? If you're not choosing to leave the house *without* your phone, *without* pokemon, then you're not doing yourself any benefit at all. You're just choosing the path of least resistance.\n", "id": "d5mzz7o"}], [{"comment": "I will admit that as someone who suffers from both that Pokemon Go has really livened up my spirits as of late.

It has unscientific social aspects mixed into the scientific aspect. That is, the scientific method is used, there are hypotheses, experimentation, statistical analyses, writing up results, etc... however, this gets distorted by dominant (and oftentimes incorrect) social aspects. \n\nThese type of results don't show that people are \"implicity or subconsciously sexist/racist.\" They simply show that people abide by the reality. For example, if there are more successful white male students, then people would want to choose a white male student over others. It is not unreasonable to expect this to be the case. We should focus on making that reality/problem less prevalent, instead of magically hoping for people to become \"less sexist\" or \"less racist\" by neglecting reality or deluding themselves. Let me use another example to explain my point:  \n\nThere was a study in which people's brains were scanned with fMRI when they had to interact with people from different races. The results showed that certain races appeared to be \"scared\" of certain races. The scientists classified this as \"implicit/subconscious racism.\" It is not implicit racism. That would be a confounding variable, because the so called \"racism\" is actually a result of something else (which I will reveal right now). If someone is walking down a dark alley at night, and sees a stranger of a certain race with higher crime rates and gets scared, it is not the RACE of that stranger that is causing the fear. It is the objectively measured higher crime crates committed by people of that race that is causing the fear. The race of that stranger simply allows the scared person to visually SEE the higher crime rate due to knowing about that association (the association/link between the stranger's race and high crime rates). That is, when someone sees someone who is associated with a race that is associated with higher crime rates on average, accordingly to basic math, they know that there is a higher chance of this stranger attacking them as compared to another race that scored lower on crime rates on average, so they get scared. It is the high crime rate causing the fear, not the race. To conclude that the race causes the fear would mean that you concluded that the race of that individual is responsible for the reason that race commits more crime, as opposed to the true reasons that that race commits more crime: such as poverty and discrimination. \n\nNow, why is that race more likely to be poor? THIS goes back to ACTUAL racism: ignorant people were racist back then and certain races that were victims of that ignorance have still not broken the poverty cycle that that initial racism created for them. The \"racism\" they suffer today is not TRUE racism: modern racist people are simply those who are too uneducated to realize that the race of the people they dislike is a confounding variable for the real reasons they dislike them (ie higher crime rates), which were, ironically, caused by real racism a long time ago. Similarly, those races who are more successful are not more successful because of the superiority of their race: they are more successful because they did not have to suffer of those disadvantages. So instead of campaigning against racism by simply saying it is \"bad\" we must EDUCATE modern racists to show them that racism does not logically make sense as the race of the person is simply a confounding variable for the negative behaviours they associate with that race: their race does not cause those behaviours. You cannot simply tell a racist that he/she is \"bad\" and expect them to change: you have to educate them on how/why they are wrong. Being politically correct, ignoring objective data/realities, and hiding the issue is not going to change anything. Unfortunately, what has happened is that political correctness hid the issue, and this caused more uneducated people to become modern racists, and is giving rise to racist alt right movements. \n\nSo it is counterproductive for scientists to say that people are implicitly misogynist or sexist, when people are actually displaying basic math skills and reasonable conclusions based on objective data. Instead, they should recognize the data for what it actually shows, and we should focus our efforts not on confounding variables such as inexistant misogyny/racism, but the true variables/causes that cause certain genders or races to remain disadvantaged. We must make it that women or minority students have enough chances to succeed, and once they have enough chances and get over the cycle of oppression that has caused them to fall behind, there will be actual equality. Once there is actual equality, nobody will have a logical reason to choose one race over another, because there won't be objective differences in performance/crime rates/success, etc... However, our current capitalist system makes this very difficult, it operates in a way that makes people less able to be concerned about long-term societal progress: it is focused on short-term success for individuals, and so if you are a professor who is going to make a risk on choosing a student who may end up wasting your valuable time, you are going to choose based on objective data/the current reality, even if this means you must discriminate. Therefore, if we want to get rid of sexism and discrimination, we must change the system we live under. Otherwise, it will be very difficult as very few people are willing to sacrifice short-term personal interest only for the sake of making the lives of other people better.

Consider radical feminists. We all know that there are many who are actually misandrists, because they do little to expose themselves to opposing viewpoints. So you get an echo chamber of 'men have it so easy, men are so violent, society only blames rape victims,' etc etc. And if you try to discuss a more nuanced perspective, or perhaps male focused issues, you'll likely get shut down. some parts of reddit are like that (redpill), but most of it is a much more diluted version that loves to look at pictures of naked women but hates to acknowledge that they might actually face discrimination", "id": "daz5oql"}, {"comment": ">yes it is speculation, which is why I wrote \"I feel\".\n\nYup, but my point is that I am not big on feelings in these discussions. Of course sometimes they may be all that we have, but anyway.\n\nYou are (at leas to me) spot on with your characterization of feminism, it has become an online joke - which is too bad because of course they often have a point. However even mainstream feminists in the media (at least in my non-US country) seem hypocritical to me, they are always fast to point out that they are for equality and will champion any cause where women have it worse than men, but they don't do the opposite.

You probably want men to get custody rights, more acknowledgement of abuse against males, better support structures for men who will become homeless (no male only shelters, and women tend to get more social support). But at the same time, you don't seem to be dogmatic or misogynistic. In the same way, most women care about issues that affect women, and are also open to reforming things that hurt men. I subscribe to the definition of feminism which is -- equality of the sexes. By that definition, most men and women are feminists (in modern western society). But *vocal* feminists tend to live in their little echo chambers which distorts their worldview and causes them to say crazy things (just like vocal mens rights advocates) because they only see how biased the world is against them, and will scoff at the idea of caring about men's rights, because they feel men already have so many advantages. \n\nIf you wish to call equality for the sexes egalitarianism or something of that nature, that's fine and would probably be beneficial, but I'm just trying to point out that most feminists are really just normal, caring people who want equality. But their work has been overshadowed by this vocal minority who have been lambasted by most of society that is outside of radical feminism. The whole movement has been characterized as being essentially in agreement with these few women, when in reality it's millions of women who are mostly reasonable people.

The thing is, it's difficult to come up with measures of some of these biases, and some it just seems to be impossible because it is so intricately linked to other variables that we cannot eliminate. What happens is we see data that shows there's a clear problem (like the insane rate of incarceration for black people vs white people) and we know something is wrong, but we can't isolate all the variables, and even if we do, that study then has to be published, reviewed, replicated and reviewed again before any clear claims could be made.

I see a lot of people hand waving away institutional racism because nobody has provided a clear, simple study that says 'we're all racist because of our natural tendency to ingroup and outgroup and that has had an overwhelmingly negative effect on the historically powerless outgroups' and I feel like they're plugging they're ears, yelling and pretending not to hear the truth.

He's clever see, he knows that being racist isn't culturally accepted anymore because of pesky civil rights, but that won't stop him, no siree!\n\nHe never once verbalized his hatred publicly and instead uses politically correct code words so he's not fired ( Firms are literally hired to design this language in politics).\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak\n\nNow instead of saying that blacks are a drain on our society he says \"welfare queens and thugs\". \n\nWhen talking about preserving white values and limiting black culture he says \"traditional American (undertone being white since minorities aren't traditional Americans) \"\n\n3) Now here's where it gets really tricky.

He might also have 1% of white individuals also getting screwed over by the law which can be seen as a downside, but now that's a plus! How can a law that's not targeting *only* Blacks and not *all* Blacks be racist.\nPreposterous!\n\nWonderful Bob!  Now you're really thinking with your Noggin! You've just legalized racial and cultural hegemony without ever putting on the Klan hood!

Sadly we've stopped caring about this truly revolutionary legal standards because a majority of Supreme Court members in the last few decades believe racism is a solved issue (besides a few KKK of course).\n\n Racism is not necessarily believing that every minority is worse at everything.\n\nIt would still be racist if someone said \"ohh no I meant those blacks, not you you're not like the others\".\n\nThe world exists in probability and of course even racists wouldn't seriously claim that Barack Obama or a Ben Carson is less intelligent than a white person with an intellectual disability.\n\nBob is the modern face of racism not the KKK, and many bobs exist who are acting solely on unconscious bias and don't actively try to be racist.

It has unscientific social aspects mixed into the scientific aspect. That is, the scientific method is used, there are hypotheses, experimentation, statistical analyses, writing up results, etc... however, this gets distorted by dominant (and oftentimes incorrect) social aspects. \n\nThese type of results don't show that people are \"implicity or subconsciously sexist/racist.\" They simply show that people abide by the reality. For example, if there are more successful white male students, then people would want to choose a white male student over others. It is not unreasonable to expect this to be the case. We should focus on making that reality/problem less prevalent, instead of magically hoping for people to become \"less sexist\" or \"less racist\" by neglecting reality or deluding themselves. Let me use another example to explain my point:  \n\nThere was a study in which people's brains were scanned with fMRI when they had to interact with people from different races. The results showed that certain races appeared to be \"scared\" of certain races. The scientists classified this as \"implicit/subconscious racism.\" It is not implicit racism. That would be a confounding variable, because the so called \"racism\" is actually a result of something else (which I will reveal right now). If someone is walking down a dark alley at night, and sees a stranger of a certain race with higher crime rates and gets scared, it is not the RACE of that stranger that is causing the fear. It is the objectively measured higher crime crates committed by people of that race that is causing the fear. The race of that stranger simply allows the scared person to visually SEE the higher crime rate due to knowing about that association (the association/link between the stranger's race and high crime rates). That is, when someone sees someone who is associated with a race that is associated with higher crime rates on average, accordingly to basic math, they know that there is a higher chance of this stranger attacking them as compared to another race that scored lower on crime rates on average, so they get scared. It is the high crime rate causing the fear, not the race. To conclude that the race causes the fear would mean that you concluded that the race of that individual is responsible for the reason that race commits more crime, as opposed to the true reasons that that race commits more crime: such as poverty and discrimination. \n\nNow, why is that race more likely to be poor? THIS goes back to ACTUAL racism: ignorant people were racist back then and certain races that were victims of that ignorance have still not broken the poverty cycle that that initial racism created for them. The \"racism\" they suffer today is not TRUE racism: modern racist people are simply those who are too uneducated to realize that the race of the people they dislike is a confounding variable for the real reasons they dislike them (ie higher crime rates), which were, ironically, caused by real racism a long time ago. Similarly, those races who are more successful are not more successful because of the superiority of their race: they are more successful because they did not have to suffer of those disadvantages. So instead of campaigning against racism by simply saying it is \"bad\" we must EDUCATE modern racists to show them that racism does not logically make sense as the race of the person is simply a confounding variable for the negative behaviours they associate with that race: their race does not cause those behaviours. You cannot simply tell a racist that he/she is \"bad\" and expect them to change: you have to educate them on how/why they are wrong. Being politically correct, ignoring objective data/realities, and hiding the issue is not going to change anything. Unfortunately, what has happened is that political correctness hid the issue, and this caused more uneducated people to become modern racists, and is giving rise to racist alt right movements. \n\nSo it is counterproductive for scientists to say that people are implicitly misogynist or sexist, when people are actually displaying basic math skills and reasonable conclusions based on objective data. Instead, they should recognize the data for what it actually shows, and we should focus our efforts not on confounding variables such as inexistant misogyny/racism, but the true variables/causes that cause certain genders or races to remain disadvantaged. We must make it that women or minority students have enough chances to succeed, and once they have enough chances and get over the cycle of oppression that has caused them to fall behind, there will be actual equality. Once there is actual equality, nobody will have a logical reason to choose one race over another, because there won't be objective differences in performance/crime rates/success, etc... However, our current capitalist system makes this very difficult, it operates in a way that makes people less able to be concerned about long-term societal progress: it is focused on short-term success for individuals, and so if you are a professor who is going to make a risk on choosing a student who may end up wasting your valuable time, you are going to choose based on objective data/the current reality, even if this means you must discriminate. Therefore, if we want to get rid of sexism and discrimination, we must change the system we live under. Otherwise, it will be very difficult as very few people are willing to sacrifice short-term personal interest only for the sake of making the lives of other people better.

However, the data is being miss-attributed. The researcher states that most readers will assume the doctor was male. Of course they will, because most doctors ARE male. I googled stats for UK, USA, and Canada. US had twice as many male doctors, and UK and Canada also had more male doctors but not by as much. Furthermore, in the past few years the number of female doctors has increased tremendously, so it would not be unreasonable for the majority of people in society to have not caught up as quickly and thus to still think that there are much more male doctors, and consequently imagine a male doctor when they hear doctor. So it is not \"sexist\" to imagine a male doctor when you hear the word doctor, it is logic. Same goes for the nanny and narrator examples.  \n\nYou haven't explained how it isn't sexist though, you've simply suggested that there is a statistical basis to a stereotype and assumption. Okay, but now show that it isn't sexist to apply that stereotype to an individual. \n\n>So no, these type of results don't show that people are \"implicity or subconsciously sexist.\" They simply show that when something is more prevalent, people are more likely to think of it than something that is less prevalent. It is not unreasonable to expect this to be the case. We should focus on making that problem less prevalent, instead of magically hoping for people to become \"less sexist\" or \"less racist\" even though they are not in the first place. \n\nBut all you're doing here is explaining how sexist norms can develop, eg overrepresentation. \n\n>Similarly, there was a study in which people's brains were scanned with fMRI when they had to interact with people from different races. The results showed that certain races appeared to be \"scared\" of certain races. The scientists classified this as \"implicit/subconscious racism.\" It is not implicit racism. That would be a confounding variable, because the so called \"racism\" is actually a result of something else (which I will reveal right now). If someone is walking down a dark alley at night, and sees a stranger of a certain race with higher crime rates and gets scared, it is not the RACE of that stranger that is causing the fear. It is the objectively measured higher crime crates committed by people of that race that is causing the fear. The race of that stranger simply allows the scared person to visually SEE the higher crime rate due to knowing about that association (the association/link between the stranger and high crime rates).\n\nThat's still clearly racism...\n\n>That is, when someone sees someone that is associated with a race that is associated with higher crime rates on average, they get scared. It is the crime causing the fear, not the race. To conclude that the race causes the fear would mean that you concluded that the race of that individual is responsible for the reason that race commits more crime, as opposed to the true reasons that that race commits more crime: such as poverty and discrimination.\n\nThat doesn't make any sense.

For example, this study suggests that professors are \"implicitly\" racist for choosing white male student more, even though they did not mean to be racist. Well, I wonder why they made such a choice: because either the objective data says white males will perform better, or their brain truly believes that the objective data would conclude that. Similarly, if people are more likely imagine a male doctor when they hear the word \"doctor\" that is because according to objective data, there ARE more male doctors. That is what I meant when I said people are not actually implicitly racist/sexist, they simply abide by the facts/realities.  \n\nThe fact is that based on objective measures, there ARE differences between races in certain aspects (as I said, objective data shows that certain races commit more crime, certain races have higher college graduation rates, etc...). It is NOT racist to accept objective data. Racism= the belief that one or more race(s) are naturally superior/inferior compared to another race/other races. Therefore, if systemic oppression caused disadvantages which result in a discrepancy between races in terms of success, it does NOT mean that there are naturally \"superior\" or \"inferior\" races. That is why I said the confounding variable is systemic oppression. The differences in success between races is due to systemic oppression, not the natural superiority of some races over others. If you understand this fact, then by virtue of logic, you cannot possibly be racist. There ARE objective differences in success between races, but this is not racism because the CAUSE of these differences are not \"natural superiority/inferiority\" of a race. Racism does not mean \"there is a difference between how members of a race act today.\" Racism would mean: \"there is a difference between how members of a race act today, and this difference is due to the natural relative superiority/inferiority of races.\" Therefore, if you accept objective data that shows that there is indeed a difference between races in certain aspects, as long as you do not attribute that difference to \"natural superiority/inferiority\" of that race, and instead you attribute the difference to other variables, such as systemic oppression, then according to logic you cannot be classified as a racist.    \n\nThose who want to delude themselves and hide objective data and call people who accept objective data \"racists\" are confused. Their solution is political correctness: they want to ignore the objective data and label anyone who even talks about the issue in any way a \"racist,\" at the same time they want to reverse discriminate against certain races/sexes. Their approach is not logical or efficient. It is based on emotion and not science. The fact is that there are objective differences, but only due to systemic oppression. Therefore, we must encourage scientists to explore and find objective differences between races, and use that to see what steps we can take to reduce the effects of systemic oppression that caused them (ie one possible solution to the lower levels of careers in certain professions for certain races may include a controlled and reasonable amount of affirmative action). You cannot stop people from believing objective data: political correctness tried, and this has caused a rise in \"new\" racists, such as  alternative right movements. I am arguing that instead we should address systemic oppression while educating \"new\" racists about the fact that it is not the \"natural superior/inferiority\" of a race that determines their success based on objective data, rather, it is a result of systemic oppression. \n", "id": "db0dlgu"}, {"comment": "Your entire position seems to boil down to two misunderstandings:\n\n1) you seem to think there is some kind of new definition which argues that accepting that there are differences between races is 'racist'.

But regardless, I maintain my position that there is only one definition of racism. I never said or implied that \"all the experts and linguists\" are wrong. YOU are the one who is saying there is more than one definition, and you are claiming that \"all\" experts and linguists agree with you. You need to support your claim.

Their argument is applying weak generalised statistics to negatively judge the behavior of an individual is racist - which has absolutely nothing to do with the acceptance or rejection of crime stats. \n\nIt is not \"weak generalized statistics.\" It is objective data and basic math (probability). If I told you that Blue Airlines has a plane crash rate of 4% per flight, and Red Airlines has a plane crash rate of 2% per flight, which would you choose to fly on? If you are a rational individual who believes the objective data, then you would choose the latter, and I bet you would if that choice actually came up. However, only due to not wanting to appear or feel \"racist,\" you are acting inconsistently in the dark alley example... because the dark alley example is logically the EXACT same thing as the plane example. If you disagree, then you lack basic knowledge about probabilities. You prove my point exactly: you, and other politically correct people, prefer to delude yourself and NOT accept the OBJECTIVE data. And when somebody DOES accept the objective data and makes decisions according to them, you call them racists. Therefore, logically speaking, you DO think that racism=accepting that there are differences between races. This also shows that your definition of racism is wrong. Thank you for demonstrating my point so clearly. \n\nInstead of wanting to accept the reality and end the causes of differences between races (systemic oppression), you prefer to delude yourself and say stuff like \"the objective data is meaningless because it is a weak generalized statistic which makes individuals look bad and evil and inferior and this is racism\" to not appear \"racist\" (which is not even actual racism because as I explained, if you accept objective data that does not make you racist) People like you are why alternative right movements have gained strength.

This is the scientific consensus on this topic, if you want to disagree then you really need to support your claims. \n\nRace is not a social concept. The fact that some people erroneously use race to have social meaning, for example, race X should be granted more rights than race Y, does not make \"race\" itself a social construction. It is true that there are no \"clear boundaries\" of races: nobody is 100% one race, however, according to biology, there are things such as chromosomes and dna, and people of the same \"race\" share those characteristics more than people of other races. So when we are talking about racism, then we must group people based on these similarities.

If my wife's lectures are anything to go by 95% of her Psychology lectures contain women (Sexism FYI). So if the class is made up of a majority of white males, then the response rate to white males will be higher.\n\nThat doesn't make any sense. The emails weren't sent by real students, they were fake. \n\n>>Specifically, faculty respond to (and therefore also agree to meet with) women and minorities, collectively, at a significantly lower rate than White males. However, once a faculty member responds to a student,no  additional  discrimination  is  observed  on  the  decision  of  whether  to respond  affirmatively  or  negatively.\n\n>Hold on, if i'm reading this correct its saying past the 10% email discrepancy reply rate, no further \"discrimination\" occurred?

Let's say that there was only a 1% difference. A consistent and solid 1% difference. \n\nYou can complain that this is minor and maybe in the grand scheme of things it is, but it's still discrimination. It's one puzzle piece that can have much larger knock on effects - especially when we deal with the real world data which shows a much larger rejection of non white male student requests. \n\n>Let me tell you a story, my wife was lecturing on Monday (5/12/16), she got into her work for 9am and was straight in with her first class, she had roughly 45mins to spare between 9am and 5pm when she finished and this included travelling between campuses, barely any time to eat let alone reply to emails.\n\n>I'm sorry but this is a complete none issue.\n\nHow does this affect the results? \n\nLet's say all of the professors were really busy and had no time to reply to many emails. Okay great. Now why do white men get more email responses? \n\nYour explanation makes things worse.

Positive reinforcement is giving of a desired reward, whereas negative reinforcement is removing of an undesired stimuli. However there's a caveat to rewarding, one should never reward something which is intrinsically rewarding, i.e. if you reward a behaviour that a child already finds rewarding (with something innate like a sense of accomplishment) you are then going to destroy the innate reward  and build an expectation of the extrinsic reward (money etc.).

Praise, it was shown by Harlow that even monkeys desire warmth and companionship from their caregivers, human children even more so, and thus they are very responsive to validation and praise, so if you give a child praise when they do a good act, and very occasional *negative* punishment (such as removing privileges.) when a bad behaviour needs to be unlearned, this is ideal for raising a child.

If you want the most ineffective and harmful way to implement punishments then you use graduated punishments, because each level of punishment results in a tolerance for punishment and makes the behavior more likely to occur again in the future and far harder to extinguish.\n\nWhat we've learnt from punishment research is that if it is going to be effective, then you need to start with the most extreme, over the top punishment that you can. Not only is this impractical for most parents, it's also hugely unethical, which is why scientists don't recommend using punishments when raising your kid - because it either won't work because you're using some flawed system like graduated punishment or you'll just be a monster that has to lash out in the most extreme way to see results.\n\n", "id": "d2k0mvq"}, {"comment": "Graduated punishments don't work?

Do you have the name of some people who've researched that? I'd love to learn more.\n\nIt mostly stems from seminal research from [Azrin and Holz](http://carboneclinic.com/portal/conferences/files/IESCUM%20Dec%202014%20SENT/new%20readings/azrin.pdf) who initially investigated Skinner's research which suggested that punishment didn't work at all and instead only temporarily suppressed behavior. Their research argued that only mild punishers suppressed behavior, and that a behavior can be extinguished by starting with the high magnitude punisher first, rather than starting low (as that allows the behavior to adjust). \n\nThere's a more modern review of the literature [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1284409/pdf/12555918.pdf) and the relevant section is the one titled: \"Punishment Magnitude\". Particularly this part:\n\n>On the basis of these findings, numerous\nauthors have recommended using moderate\nor high-intensity punishers to treat problem\nbehavior and cautioned against increasing\nthe intensity of punishment gradually over\ntime (e.g., Cooper et al., 1987; Martin &\nPear, 1996; O\u2019Brien, 1989). These guidelines\nmay be difficult to reconcile with ethical\nmandates to identify the least restrictive\nprocedure that is effective\n\nThey go on to discuss other issues I've noted, and suggest weaker punishers may be effective when delivered immediately following a behavior and when paired with a reinforcement schedule, but in the case of parenting and spanking this makes the punishment unnecessary (since it can rarely be applied immediately, and if you're going to use reinforcement methods then you might as well skip the punisher).\n\n>Graduated punishments fail when parents lack follow through. Smaller gestures of punishment need to represent larger punishments. So a child needs to know deep down in their heat that if they push their parent's buttons, that stern talking to will absolutely escalate to a grounding or spanking (or whatever punishment the child hates).\n\nThe problem is that the advantage of using punishment is that its effect is immediate and permanent. So if you're having to step up punishments then, by definition, it's not working and you're making things worse. \n\nThe issue, as described above, is that what happens with graduated punishments is that you teach them to habituate to that level of punisher. So when you're stepping up the intensity you're no longer stepping up the behavioral effect, as the next level will now only have the exact same effect as the initial punisher - your actions just have to be more extreme to achieve the same useless outcome.\n\n>Which is what I'm sure the research you're talking about demonstrates. Which... yah, a parent would need to do something severe enough to demonstrate their willingness to use harsh punishments. But I feel they would only need to do this one or twice. Perhaps at most once per different types of infractions. Children boundary test, and if they meet a strong boundary they'll stop (unless they have learning issues). And I'm not sold on the idea that to deter further boundary testing a parent has to full on hit a child (so I'm cautious about the phrasing \"extreme and over the top\").\n\nIt's not about proving they're serious or willing, it's simply part of the behavioral laws of behavior. Punishments are less effective at changing our behavior so they need to be applied in very specific ways to work, and one of those ways is that we have to avoid using weaker punishments as they just train children (and adults, and animals, etc) to adjust to that level of punishment so that it has much less of an effect.\n\n>Parents who use more abusive physical measures. What I'm saying is that it has been posited that parents who immediately spank children lack parenting skills in general - so they may also be emotionally abusive, neglectful, or model impulsive or rage-y behaviors. So, kids wind up worse in outcome measures not so much due to spanking, but because the spanking is done by emotionally unskilled parents and that's a bad situation to grow up in.\n\nBut this wouldn't explain why we see a dose-dependent relationship (where more spanking leads to worse outcomes), why we observe a reduction in negative outcomes when we implement a reversal design where we get parents to stop spanking, or why we observe the exact same effects for punishment in general.\n\n", "id": "d2k8xd3"}, {"comment": "Very interesting!

It is a litany of fallacies invoked to claim that 'feminism' occupies the stance of 'basic respect and fair treatment' and non-feminists do not.

All statements are either true or false.  One cannot prove a falsity, unless to show that it is false in the merit of it's logical form.  Square circles, non-material material, three infinities, unchanging change, etc.  Translation: it is bullshit automatically by it's very existence.  Duality in logical structure is automatically invalid, such as is your statement.  Responding to this sentence was your big embarrassing mistake overall, as it illustrates your lack of agency in analyzing what you are reading.  It sets the tone for your rebuttals.  A triple hitter.  Not only did you dishonestly exclude my entire subsequent reasoning in this rebut, but as you must understand now after my explanation, a statement can be 'flawed' and you committed a \"problem b\" fallacy by taxonomizing your very flawed conclusion as \"merely\" descriptive.  yes! it is descriptive, and it is flawed, and I have now shown why once preemptively and now twice.\n\nimmediately after, I took your statement and translated it logically.  And you thought that I was making a claim... tsk.  I was actually and clearly highlighting the duality of the two statements.  I then stated that there were two possibilities to explain this: delusion(willful ignorance) or sophistry, just a bit of tongue-in-cheek.  You then held that statement by itself as an assertion, where it was clearly following the preceding translation.  Duality is demonstrably false to anyone who wishes to examine it.  You can use a truth table if you want.  Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.\n\nThen, inexplicably, you miss that I was the one claiming that the statement was a fallacy, and you then proceeded to claim that it was a fallacy committed by myself.  Yes, and the fallacy is called excluded middle or false dichotomy.  Or, in other words, YOUR false dichotomy.  This is easily extrapolated from your statement by anyone who got a D or higher in level 1 logic.  More evidence you aren't comprehending, just filtering the information from it's context, which is in turn more evidence that you are being intentionally or willfully ignorant of the point.\n\nThe next rebuttal only further illustrates the point you rebut.  You do NOT hold the idea that feminism is accurately described only with \"basic respect and fair treatment.\"  That was the whole point! still not reading, are you?  It is a separate subject if feminism is a force for good, but I would take the stance that philosophical ideals, such as feminism, are simply TOOLS for PEOPLE who are forces for good, and not ALL good(of womens rights) people hold that ideal or indeed any ideals.  Given this statement, you would be hard-pressed to illustrate that the PEOPLE who care about WOMENS RIGHTS are not FULLY RESPONSIBLE for any victories, or failures for that matter, that feminism claims or avoids for itself respectively.  It's called Occam's razor, and to presume otherwise is MAGICAL THINKING.  This is SELF EVIDENT.\n\nThis next response is made apparently without reading my entire argument despite it is about the entire argument, so the only thing im going to say about this is that YOU are the one who has to back up the claim that male privilege is factual.  And, to do so honestly, would be to see to it that you restrict it to CONTEMPORARY FIRST WORLD MALE PRIVILEGE BEYOND THE DEVIATION IN WHICH FEMALE PRIVILEGE MANIFESTS, as this is the privilege is that I am identifying.  Don't equivocate.  I do not in anyway deny the disgusting and shameful realities of the many and most times in history where women were treated as subhuman or simply lesser humans or simply oppressed despite the awareness by the community of them as equals.  My claim is that privilege is, in first world countries such as the U.S., ON AVERAGE at least approximately equal or in favor of women CONTEMPORARILY by the SAME CRITERIA that privilege is evaluated by feminism and all relevant 'sciences'.  That being said, i personally believe that privilege has a limitation of evaluation in that it cannot be proven unless the privilege itself is explicitly described by systematic rules intentionally designed to function in that manner.  That doesn't mean there isn't unfairness, but currently described standards are flawed such as that privilege can be found anywhere and everywhere even where it is sensibly inapplicable, making the irrelevancy of the methodology excessively consistent.  Quoting Anita Sarkeesian, \"everything is sexist..., and it is our job to point it out.\"  I think this woman is a very respectably intellectually consistent individual, and very accurately represents the current ideals evaluation of sexist privilege.  However, anything you can find everywhere and explained more simply by other things is automatically irrelevant to every analysis that better describes a phenomenon falsifiably.  Translation: no falsifiability, then no discreet value.  There is no falsifiability with the current understanding of privilege, making it unscientific.  Just because we are in a Science subreddit doesn't make feminism some kind of science-backed idealism.  There is no such thing as scientifically-supported idealism any more than Huckleberry Fin is a scientifically supported fictional character.\n\nThe democratic process is the current ultimate albeit imperfect social nullifier of privilege.  It doesn't matter who you are voting for.  Privilege is an affectation of the PRESCRIPTION OF RIGHT.  Law is THE MOST POWERFUL KIND OF EXERCISABLE PRESCRIPTION OF RIGHT AND PRIVILEGE THAT EXISTS.  Please don't make me explain the political and law-making process to you.  Just recall what you learned a couple years ago in 8th grade social studies and you will realize why the single most important and powerful women's rights victory in all history is the right to vote.  Are you calling me wrong on this? lets see what kind of wiggling you do to get out of your rebutting statement and Ill submit it to major encyclopedias as case example for the pitfalls of ideology.\n\nnext remark...again.  There is no science like economics, and when it comes to money, there is nothing more valuable nor damning than economic statistics.  That is why feminists use it, and that is why I am using it.  how did we over look this? fallacum ad populum much?  Ideologies regularly ignore damning statistics, thereby making them useless in a debate against an ideology.  If an idealist can't explain it favorably, they will overlook it.  And apparently, YOU have been doing a LOT of overlooking for a long long time.  If you had simply attempted to reason with me or actually rebut my arguments, then you would eventually see that I am absolutely open to anything reasonable you have to say and I would LOVE to see you change my mind.

All statements are either true or false. One cannot prove a falsity, unless to show that it is false in the merit of it's logical form. Square circles, non-material material, three infinities, unchanging change, etc. Translation: it is bullshit automatically by it's very existence. Duality in logical structure is automatically invalid, such as is your statement. Responding to this sentence was your big embarrassing mistake overall, as it illustrates your lack of agency in analyzing what you are reading. It sets the tone for your rebuttals. A triple hitter. Not only did you dishonestly exclude my entire subsequent reasoning in this rebut, but as you must understand now after my explanation, a statement can be 'flawed' and you committed a \"problem b\" fallacy by taxonomizing your very flawed conclusion as \"merely\" descriptive. yes! it is descriptive, and it is flawed, and I have now shown why once preemptively and now twice.\n\nNone of this made any sense. I seriously recommend you stop using terms like \"logic\" and \"fallacies\" because you don't seem to know what they mean, as such when you use them in sentences it makes it incomprehensible. \n\nIn future, if you're going to accuse me of doing something dishonest, you need to describe or quote the dishonest section. You can't just say some part is dishonest without giving me a clue as to what you're responding to. \n\n>immediately after, I took your statement and translated it logically. And you thought that I was making a claim... tsk. I was actually and clearly highlighting the duality of the two statements. I then stated that there were two possibilities to explain this: delusion(willful ignorance) or sophistry, just a bit of tongue-in-cheek. You then held that statement by itself as an assertion, where it was clearly following the preceding translation. Duality is demonstrably false to anyone who wishes to examine it. You can use a truth table if you want. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.\n\nNobody claimed duality. And please don't pretend you know how to use truth tables - figure out basic logical fallacies first, then move up to the big boy stuff.\n\n>Then, inexplicably, you miss that I was the one claiming that the statement was a fallacy, and you then proceeded to claim that it was a fallacy committed by myself. Yes, and the fallacy is called excluded middle or false dichotomy. Or, in other words, YOUR false dichotomy. This is easily extrapolated from your statement by anyone who got a D or higher in level 1 logic. More evidence you aren't comprehending, just filtering the information from it's context, which is in turn more evidence that you are being intentionally or willfully ignorant of the point.\n\nThe mistake you made was that nobody presented a dichotomy. I simply said \"Feminists tend to argue X\" and you got angry because you thought that meant non-feminists couldn't also argue X.\n\nI've explained why your reasoning is false above, if you want to respond to that then feel free to try to do so. Name dropping fallacies that are irrelevant here isn't going to help you.\n\n>The next rebuttal only further illustrates the point you rebut. You do NOT hold the idea that feminism is accurately described only with \"basic respect and fair treatment.\" That was the whole point! still not reading, are you?\n\nThe reading comprehension failure is on your end. I never claimed that feminism holds a monopoly on those things. That's the whole point, you're arguing against a strawman based on your own fallacious reasoning.\n\nHoly shit, I'm going to stop here as your response just gets crazier from there. I can only assume you're a kid and maybe you've just done your first philosophy paper and you're super enthusiastic about all this, but your comment demonstrates a painful degree of ignorance and cluelessness. There's not much to add if you can't string together a coherent train of thought. \n\n\n\n", "id": "d0p7kbu"}, {"comment": "I appreciate your responses.", "id": "d0pait6"}]]], "4q358m": ["Why Scientists Think We Should Be Working Three Day Weeks", "2016-06-27 16:47:00", 516, "http://www.thelowdownblog.com/2016/06/why-scientists-think-we-should-be.html", [[191, "We are going to look back at this time as being barbaric for the mind, similar to how we look back at medieval medical practices."], [37, "[removed]"], [33, "\"This does not mean we should be paid five days' compensation for three days' work, but..\"\n\nWhy fucking not ?

You get your relationship officially recognized, and depending where you live, you are allowed, and even expected to have sex without being judged by society.\n\nMarriage is also synonymous with a committed long term living together relationship. The actual official signature is ~~irrelevant~~ less relevant.\n\nIf you see marriage as as the signature for state sanctioned fucking, it has almost no added value to anyone's life. You can see it as imprisonment and misery.\n\nIf you see it the second way, you get a best friend to live with, a partner to share the burden of your life, and someone you can fully trust when times are difficult.\n\nWhen people say marriage is awesome, I'm highly sure they have the second approach.", "id": "d67q0lc"}, {"comment": ":) thanks for this well-formulated answer.

Yeah. Probably. But I don't really know anyone our age who has managed to maintain a close enough friend's group over the years to actually manage it.

For married people, just the opposite was true.\"\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/4wg7i4/being_single_allows_people_to_live_their_best/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.6, ~87304 tl;drs so far.\") | [Theory](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/) | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PMs and comment replies are read by the bot admin, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **people**^#1 **single**^#2 **marry**^#3 **more**^#4 **Live**^#5", "id": "d66pmbg"}], [{"comment": "I'm married.

Several researchers have suggested that altruism is a costly signal of desirable qualities, such that it could have evolved by sexual selection. In two studies, we show that altruism is broadly linked with mating success. In Study 1, participants who scored higher on a self-report altruism measure reported they were more desirable to the opposite sex, as well as reported having more sex partners, more casual sex partners, and having sex more often within relationships. Sex moderated some of these relationships, such that altruism mattered more for men's number of lifetime and casual sex partners. In Study 2, participants who were willing to donate potential monetary winnings (in a modified dictator dilemma) reported having more lifetime sex partners, more casual sex partners, and more sex partners over the past year. Men who were willing to donate also reported having more lifetime dating partners. Furthermore, these patterns persisted, even when controlling for narcissism, Big Five personality traits, and socially desirable responding.

Several researchers have suggested that altruism is a costly signal of desirable qualities, such that it could have evolved by sexual selection. In two studies, we show that altruism is broadly linked with mating success. In Study 1, participants who scored higher on a self-report altruism measure reported they were more desirable to the opposite sex, as well as reported having more sex partners, more casual sex partners, and having sex more often within relationships. Sex moderated some of these relationships, such that altruism mattered more for men's number of lifetime and casual sex partners. In Study 2, participants who were willing to donate potential monetary winnings (in a modified dictator dilemma) reported having more lifetime sex partners, more casual sex partners, and more sex partners over the past year. Men who were willing to donate also reported having more lifetime dating partners. Furthermore, these patterns persisted, even when controlling for narcissism, Big Five personality traits, and socially desirable responding.

I said that I was feeling the best I had in my entire life and wanted to go down in my meds. The doc said that I had to replace the meds with a different coping mechanism and told me aerobic exercise, for at least 20 minutes, most days, was his primary recommendation (and to read about mindfulness meditation and training). The meditation part wasn't as good for me, but the exercise though? Magic. I managed to go down quite a bit in my meds (woot!) and my body and mind felt better. Depression doesn't just affect your mood, it can affect sleep, pain, concentration, appetite, etc. and exercise is a great way to regulate all of that.\n\nI think that one of the environmental contributors to depression is this low-grade but ever present stress we have. At any given moment, it might not be that bad, but cumulatively, it can be a problem. I feel like exercise pushes your body physically and then when it's over, your body goes into a \"healing\" or \"reset\" mode to go back to a calm, even state, which can be a hard state to reach after a mentally stressful day. It pushes you hard enough that it triggers a \"recover\" response that I think is really helpful for those with depression.\n\nObviously there aren't many definitive studies about exercise and depression ([here's a review though](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicole_Berchtold/publication/6075740_Exercise_Builds_Brain_Health_Key_Roles_of_Growth_Factor_Cascades_and_Inflammation/links/0fcfd50ef33d16a46f000000.pdf)), but I know that exercise can change your body's chemistry. I think on a more psychological level, running or going to the gym forces you to take time out of your day and do something for yourself. It's not taking care of anyone else, or meeting someone else's schedule. It's you doing something for your own well-being and there's probably something therapeutic about that.\n\nI would also be interested to see how exercise modulates inflammation responses in the body. I know that there are some hints of a connection between major depressive disorder and inflammation, at least in some patients ([citation](http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/home/article/depression-and-inflammation-examining-the-link/b436332438ceca4baabe8be08701d6dc.html)) and I wonder if exercise could affect those pathways."], [19, "I suffer from severe depression and every time I try aleviate it with excercise I end up feeling worse because I am reminded of how fat and out of shape I am.

It's the fact that you're doing something you haven't done before; the act of learning something new (\"Those newly generated brain cells can be 'rescued from death by new learning experiences'\"). It would be interesting to find out if the effect wears off as the patient becomes more accustomed to meditation, whether or not other pre-exercise activities would work just as well (solving a puzzle, reading a challenging book, learning how to play an instrument, etc), or what the effects of running-only are."], [3, "I like this area of research and I hope work continues to explore the possibility of more effective treatments for depression.\n\nHowever, I don't think the referenced study did a very good job of the experimental design and statistical analysis. I see two major problems. The most obvious is the lack of a control group. They had all participants undergo the same treatment, which means they are unable to control for many depressed people simply feeling better over time. The second problem is survivorship bias. Despite what the article says, Alderman et al. recruited not 52, but 69 participants. That means 17 of the original sample did not complete the program. Of the original 69, there were 33 depressed and 36 non-depressed only 22 depressed and 30 non-depressed finished. This means nearly double the number of depressed participants dropped out (33% of depressed vs 17% of non-depressed dropping out). Why would someone drop out of a study to treat depression? Maybe because their depression is not getting any better. What happens when you exclude the people for whom the treatment did not work? Inflated effect sizes. \n\nI contend that the paper has failed to prove the effect size is due to anything other than poor experimental design.\n\n[Link to paper](http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v6/n2/full/tp2015225a.html)"], [2, "Really interesting, I used to meditate and do a lot of exercise, including jogging, walking, weight lifting and cycling when I had bad anxiety and depression.

Secondly, for those with severe depression tasks that seem as simple as these generally are not enough to overcome depression. "]], [[{"comment": "My psychiatrist is very much about exercise as treatment. I said that I was feeling the best I had in my entire life and wanted to go down in my meds. The doc said that I had to replace the meds with a different coping mechanism and told me aerobic exercise, for at least 20 minutes, most days, was his primary recommendation (and to read about mindfulness meditation and training). The meditation part wasn't as good for me, but the exercise though? Magic. I managed to go down quite a bit in my meds (woot!) and my body and mind felt better. Depression doesn't just affect your mood, it can affect sleep, pain, concentration, appetite, etc. and exercise is a great way to regulate all of that.\n\nI think that one of the environmental contributors to depression is this low-grade but ever present stress we have. At any given moment, it might not be that bad, but cumulatively, it can be a problem. I feel like exercise pushes your body physically and then when it's over, your body goes into a \"healing\" or \"reset\" mode to go back to a calm, even state, which can be a hard state to reach after a mentally stressful day. It pushes you hard enough that it triggers a \"recover\" response that I think is really helpful for those with depression.\n\nObviously there aren't many definitive studies about exercise and depression ([here's a review though](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicole_Berchtold/publication/6075740_Exercise_Builds_Brain_Health_Key_Roles_of_Growth_Factor_Cascades_and_Inflammation/links/0fcfd50ef33d16a46f000000.pdf)), but I know that exercise can change your body's chemistry. I think on a more psychological level, running or going to the gym forces you to take time out of your day and do something for yourself. It's not taking care of anyone else, or meeting someone else's schedule. It's you doing something for your own well-being and there's probably something therapeutic about that.\n\nI would also be interested to see how exercise modulates inflammation responses in the body. I know that there are some hints of a connection between major depressive disorder and inflammation, at least in some patients ([citation](http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/home/article/depression-and-inflammation-examining-the-link/b436332438ceca4baabe8be08701d6dc.html)) and I wonder if exercise could affect those pathways.", "id": "d1fia6f"}, {"comment": "Every therapist should recommend exercise to all their clients.

They had all participants undergo the same treatment, which means they are unable to control for many depressed people simply feeling better over time. The second problem is survivorship bias.

I mean if you're living on the streets, often with physical as well as mental health issues that you can't afford to see anyone for, heroin can seem a valid coping mechanism; after all, you do experience the world without so much of its harshness when you use heroin. Not to mention that living on the streets almost always entails running into other users. *And*, not to mention that it is pretty hard to find the motivation to kick any addiction when the reality of your situation seems even worse...\n\nWhy on earth would you think it would be anywhere near as easy for one to \"drop the needle\" while living in poverty, social stigma, and undiagnosed mental illnesses, as being able to afford rent and necessities and maybe even a therapist? A doctor's visit? If you think that heroin addicts stop using when they run out of money for heroin I have news for you...\n\nOh and by the way, do you know how fucking awful heroin withdrawal is? Well it's ten times worse without a roof or access to facilities of any sort, I'd imagine.\n\n>and start writing works of art\n\nI disagree with your having basing your assessment of whether or not a person should be enabled to live free from extraneous suffering on what they will bring to the table, so to speak. It deeply bothers me, actually, that you seem to be implying that a person who will not \"contribute to society\" does not deserve to live or feel happiness.\n\nI see that you're basing your assessment on the idea that they \"brought it upon thesmelves\" and thus can be held accountable by being withheld aid... this reflects your lack of information on the subject. Many heroin addicts began their use following physical injury, when they were put on powerful opiates as pain relief and then left dangling with either too high tolerance to afford the necessary pills, or were cut off from their prescription by virtue of their injury having healed with a lingering opiate addiction. \n\nI won't try to go over the manifold causal factors involved in the development of heroin addiction with you because that's a whole other thing, but if you're curious I'd be happy to elaborate.\n\nBut regardless of the situation I would prefer a live heroin addict to a dead body any day. My city Vancouver has an amazing program called InSite, by which addicts can be provided sterile needles and a safe place to inject in a clinic, and it's led to some really beautiful changes. And hey, many protested (and continue to protest) that clinic's existence; how could we *possibly* justify paying to essentially help addicts stay addicted? Well, these people are going to be injecting either way. Anyone who believes that a dependent IV heroin user will be even remotely set back by the lack of clean equipment and a safe, cozy environment in which to shoot up, well... that's just not how it works. \n\nInSite doesn't exist to \"cure\" addiction -- though they also offer counselling, detox, etc. services -- but rather to reduce the many enormous risks to the user which are posed by unsanitary conditions, needle sharing, and a lack of heath services access (note that many many fatal overdoses could have been prevented if they were not shooting up alone, or with those who for whatever reason wouldn't call 911). They don't just provide a clean place to shoot up, but a system of resources which aid addicts in a) maximally reducing the harmful effects which their addictions frequently involve, b) assessing and improving their emotional/mental/physical health via on-site services and available referrals, c) providing the means and support with which long-term recovery is made a possibility. \n\nAnd as for its effects:\n\n>It is evident throughout the research that these goals have been achieved. Since\nInSite opened its doors, **over 800 potential overdose related fatalities have been avoided**. Statistics\nshow that InSite averages 1.3 overdoses per 1000 injections (Dooling, & Rachlis, 2010). The promotion\nof safer injecting practices has **greatly reduced the risk for blood borne disease transmission** (Small et al,\n2007). InSite is often a gateway that leads to **increased admissions to local maintenance programs and\naddiction treatments**. It has reduced the number of people injecting in public and the amount of drug\nparaphernalia on the streets (Kerr et al, 2007). The presence of InSite has not led to an increase in drug\u2010\nrelated crime; rates of arrest for drug trafficking, assaults, and robbery were similar after the facility's\nopening, **and rates of vehicle break\u2010ins/theft declined significantly** (Vancouver Health Authority, 2010).\n\nInSite users are 30% more likely than non-InSite users to seek detox treatment. Overdose deaths around the area declined by about 35%!! \n\nAnd guess what? When you take into account that it prevents an average of 35 new cases of HIV and 3 deaths each year, after analyzing all program costs, this safe injection clinic -- paid for by taxpayer dollars -- generates a surplus of $6 million annually for the city. That's right, the place (only one location, mind you) where addicts get clean needles, and safe booths in which to inject drugs, and even help preparing their drugs by professionals trained to do so properly, all paid for by taxpayer dollars...\n\n* makes the city money\n\n* saves many lives, through both overdose prevention and limiting the spread of blood-borne diseases\n\n* leads to a great increase in, as you put it, \"dropping the needle\"\n\nAnd not to mention cleaning up the streets by no longer necessitating a homeless addict's drug-related activities to be in public.\n\nYou'd think, by your logic, that providing heroin addicts with needles, a safe/legal place to get high, and professionals who will set up their drugs for them so all they have to do is inject, would vastly hinder them in getting clean. You'd be wrong. Is it so much of a stretch to see how the same outcome would surely apply if they were provided a universal income?

However, experience shows that it heavily biases the role of capital against the role of labour in its distribution. Furthermore, because of automation full employment (already an arbitrary line drawn at forty hours per week) of every person has not be necessary to produce all that society requires for the past century. It is thus perfectly reasonable to say that humans, by mere virtue of their existence are entitled to a share of the surplus should it exist regardless of whether they were individually tapped for its production, especially when we have been politically unwilling to lower the bar of full employment.\n\nAs a society we should maintain complete agency to distribute the surplus as we see fit (deciding democratically of course).

Strangely for you, I don't think you actually are arguing for a pure free market economy where prices aren't altered, instead you are probably suggesting that there is no scarcity for things.

This section doesn't make sense, it seems to contradict itself. I think the biggest element that confuses your analysis is a missing time parameter. You mean, that in the short term, because there have been policies which have pushed up or down prices, that to get to equilibrium there would be moves in the opposite direction until some tendency for balance resulted, which... also in the short term would likely result in many suppliers that are unsustainable at that (lower) market price, going out of business. If you understand the implications by what is meant by supply-demand you should already see the problem with the next part, a long term food shortage implies less food than what is demanded... which implies.... higher price. All this is even more confused for the reason you seem to suggest why those policies were implemented to somehow ensure enough food? When your own reasoning suggests isn't the case? Are you saying they are mistaken or stupid or ignorant in applying those policies?\n\n- That there is a glut/shortage when such a policy is suddenly removed resulting in a crash/explosion in market price for said goods in the short term illustrates, if anything that supply and demand are still dominant. You can modify incentives you can't define them or ignore them. \n\nAside: If you want to get into the actual economic theory the only entity that can truly pick price through controlling quantity are monopolies. To the degree that such government policies de facto create monopolies (no one can enter that market and they are the only provider of said good/service,) where such a dynamic can occur, it would do the opposite of keep those economies afloat, it would create needless dead weight loss, stabilizing the monopolist at the expense of the rest of the economy as a whole (also threatening the monopolist if it were to ever return to a normal competitive stance without such preferential treatments, as just like your farmers they would have to deal with a tremendous \"shock.\") \n\nTL:DR - I don't see anything in what you said that actually lines up with your original claim.

Look at how the experiments by people like Thorndike and Skinner are set up - they give the animals 80-85% of what they need and then measure how they respond after that. That's what the OP is suggesting. \n\nThe animals don't refuse to respond just because they've received a base rate of necessities because reinforcement doesn't work based on a naive form of satiation alone. If my boss gave me all the food I needed to eat in a day then I'd still work hard because I want the money to buy other rewarding shit, like tvs and cars.\n\nThis distinction in the literature is the difference between open and closed economies - open is where free food is available and closed is where all food has to be earned in the experiment. There are differences between these economies but we often see durable responding in open economies and high rates of responding, so we definitely don't see the effect you're suggesting. \n\nOn a more practical level, we need to ensure the establishing operations are primed for optional learning and responding. Think of it in terms of dog training - if certain necessities aren't met, like them being well-slept, had access to water, shelter or toilet etc, then they aren't going to be reinforced by food treats as their value will have bottomed out. \n\nEven Thorndike wouldn't argue that a simple law of effect doesn't exist in a vacuum.

But this is untrue, even for Watson's methodological behaviorism which was intentionally simplistic. \n\nNo behaviorist is a blank slatist and all make it clear that behavior is an interaction of biology and environment. Skinner went further than most by suggesting that we can't have a science of psychology without studying the complexity of the mind, and set up a methodology for studying cognition.

Even if MDMA is neurotoxic, the advantage is that it would require only a few treatments rather than having to take it every day or every time you feel anxious/unhappy (as you have to do with other drugs).\n\n> that hasn't been researched or studied with animals and people on multiple levels of studies?\n\nI simple scholar search yields over 40,000 results for MDMA, and SSRI only about twice as much (notable is also that there are different kinds of SSRIs).

Growing evidence indicates that humans are also susceptible to MDMA\u2019s neurotoxic effects, although few functional consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT damage have been identified. Objective: The present study sought to determine whether possible differences between MDMA users and control subjects could be unmasked by utilizing a pharmacological challenge with the mixed 5-HT agonist, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP). It was postulated that 5-HT neurotoxicity in MDMA users would be associated with altered 5-HT responsivity, exemplified by altered physiological and behavioral responses to m-CPP. Methods: Twenty-five MDMA users who had not taken MDMA for at least 3 weeks and 25 controls received intravenous placebo (normal saline) and m-CPP (0.08 mg/kg) in a fixed order, single blind design. Repeated measures of mood, physical symptoms, and blood samples for neuroendocrine analyses were collected during the 90 min after each infusion. *Results: MDMA users reported more positive and fewer negative emotions and physical symptoms following m-CPP than controls, and were significantly less likely to report an m-CPP-induced panic attack. Male MDMA users had diminished cortisol and prolactin responses to m-CPP. Conclusions: The present data indicate that MDMA users have alterations in 5-HT neuronal function, possibly as a consequence of MDMA-induced brain serotonin neural injury.*\n\nEmphasis mine.\n\nFrom my understanding of their conclusions, MDMA users were behaviorally shown to be less affected by m-CPP, a drug component known for offering a generally unpleasant experience and inducing panic attacks. \n\nAbout SSRI : that is indeed similar to the effects of SSRI's, of which I'm not a fan.

The statement was:\n\n> \u201cThere\u2019s pretty much no way to say \u2018homophobes are probably gay\u2019 without being kinda homophobic yourself.\u201d\n\nThe reason the truth content of the study is relevant here because if the study *were* true, then \"homophobes are probably gay\" would be a statement of fact.  In that scenario, it would be arguing that there's no way to make a certain factual statement without being \"kinda homophobic\". I trust you'll agree that'd be ridiculous.\n\nAs it is, if we give people saying such things some benefit of the doubt, they believe the study is true. In that case, it is certainly possible to say \"homophobes are probably gay\" without being homophobic.\n\n> There's also another problematic part of saying that homophobes are gay, because it localizes homophobia within the gay community, which is clearly absurd.\n\nAgain, it wouldn't be absurd if the study were correct, which is what the people in question apparently believe.\n\n> I don't think you addressed schadenfreude at all really, let alone arguing for it being defensible, you only denied it.\n\nI'll spell it out, then. Schadenfreude is a natural human emotion when one finds out that someone who you dislike, are jealous of, etc., has suffered some misfortune. The misfortune in this case would be the discovery that they themselves are the kind of people they've been publicly criticizing. That's certainly a misfortune, having nothing to do with whether being gay is bad, good, or neutral. One doesn't have to be homophobic to feel schadenfreude in that case, and it's as defensible as any case of schadenfreude ever is.\n\nAnd that is why that characterization, \u201cIt makes me happy that these people I think are bad are really something I think is\u2026neutral or good\u201d is a perverse one.

Because that seems to me the only way you can justify the sort of judgmental attitude to this that you're exhibiting.\n\n", "id": "d0pgzd0"}, {"comment": ">The reason the truth content of the study is relevant here because if the study were true, then \"homophobes are probably gay\" would be a statement of fact. In that scenario, it would be arguing that there's no way to make a certain factual statement without being \"kinda homophobic\". I trust you'll agree that'd be ridiculous.\n\nExcept that this study provides very little evidence that homophobes are gay. Even the authors themselves admit that their construct of homophobia is lacking, because they are unable to assess a behavioural component, which is undoubtedly the most important one--actually it's the most central one to the construct. So even if the plethysmograph validly measures sexual arousal and is unconfounded by other physiological measures, it's still not necessarily so that homophobes are repressed homosexuals.\n\n>As it is, if we give people saying such things some benefit of the doubt, they believe the study is true. In that case, it is certainly possible to say \"homophobes are probably gay\" without being homophobic.\n\nMost people don't know about the study. The problem is simply that it validates homophobic myths. It's far removed from what is more likely to be true -- that some individuals who display prejudice towards homosexuals are in fact homophobic towards themselves as well.\n\n>Again, it wouldn't be absurd if the study were correct, which is what the people in question apparently believe.\n\nMy comment also applies to this. Homophobia is a much larger construct, homophobic behaviours are so widespread that it's impossible that all of these people are homosexuals.\n\n>I'll spell it out, then. Schadenfreude is a natural human emotion when one finds out that someone who you dislike, are jealous of, etc., has suffered some misfortune. The misfortune in this case would be the discovery that they themselves are the kind of people they've been publicly criticizing. That's certainly a misfortune, having nothing to do with whether being gay is bad, good, or neutral. One doesn't have to be homophobic to feel schadenfreude in that case, and it's as defensible as any case of schadenfreude ever is.\n\n>And that is why that characterization, \u201cIt makes me happy that these people I think are bad are really something I think is\u2026neutral or good\u201d is a perverse one. It's missing a significant and much more charitable alternative about where the schadenfreude could be coming from.\n\nIt doesn't seem charitable to me at all. It's laughing at people because you discover that they *themselves* are victims of homophobia. As well as the already mentioned fact that it localizes homophobia in a very narrow space: among the victims of homophobia themselves. Plus, I have to add, it promotes a definition of homophobia as a stable trait found in some individuals but not in others, which is also extremely wrong and creates a blindness towards the sociopolitical nature of homophobia.\n\nOf course, you could say that people who perpetuate such myths are \"nice\" people and doing it in a misguided effort to help homosexual people. Sure! I don't think it necessarily has to be due to malice. But it *is* paradoxical and could easily be defined as homophobic regardless.\n\n>So are you suggesting that people are doing this with full knowledge that the study is false? Because that seems to me the only way you can justify the sort of judgmental attitude to this that you're exhibiting.\n\nEh, you seem to have a hyper-rational view of individuals in society. People don't go around thinking \"hey, I'm homophobic and today I found this study that I could use to perpetrate a myth about homosexuals that will distract people from the real issues concerning homophobia as well as alleviating the responsibility of heterosexual people to support gay people.\" -- The problem obviously has more to do with social structures.", "id": "d0pv0vc"}, {"comment": "Yeah. . .

If they or others suffer from their own behaviour, the understanding of the root of their behaviour is the first step to getting better.\nExample:\nA parent abuses their child. Oftentimes the reason for this form of discrimination of others lies within their own childhood experience of abuse, their fear of not being a valuable human or feeling powerless. \nIf this said parent goes to therapy and understands the root of their abuse, that it's not the childs behaviour that deserves the abuse, but their own inability to cope with their own trauma or feeling of worthlessness. This can be the start of recovering. \n\nYou say: \"I find it degrading or petty to use psychology as a tool to try and diminish an enemy social group\".

It's inflammatory to those many people to constantly be stereotyped out of existence. Even if the statement itself is literally true, there are two problems.\n\nFirst, constantly making these \"a lot of trump supporters\" or \"most trump supporters\" or \"the typical trump supporter\" may be *technically* correct, but it still completely marginalizes and ignore the many Trump supporters who are not prejudiced. We never talk about them and we generally rope them in with racists.\n\nSecond, painting Trump supporters as the prejudiced ones wrongly forgives Clinton supporters. For example, one of the polls that article cites in order to defend the claim that Trump supporters are prejudiced says that 58% of Trump supporters and 24% of Clinton supporters have unfavorable views of Islam. First of all, \"have unfavorable views of Islam\" is not the same as being prejudiced. As an atheist, I have unfavorable views of any religion, yet my roommate is Jewish and my best friend is a devout Christian and I don't think any less of them. But, let's assume that it does mean you're prejudiced... then... going back to the claim \"it is clear that the prejudiced views of a lot of Americans helped elect...\" isn't it clear that 24% of Clinton supporters is \"a lot\" of people too? Just because Trump had more voters who gave the \"prejudiced\" answer doesn't mean that we have to throw out the real narrative, \"a lot\" of *both* sides were prejudiced. Race and religion stereotypes were part of BOTH platforms. The prejudice against Islam that's shared by both sides, isn't the only kind of prejudice. Along the election season, there were routinely a lot of prejudice attacks on the \"white\" base of not only Trump, but Sanders too. The amount of times I saw people write off Sanders supports as a bunch of rural white boys in a derogatory sense is too many to count.\n\nI think the real takeaway here is that we have to stop making discrete groups. When 1 in 4 Clinton supporters gives the \"prejudiced\" answer and 1 in 2 Trump supporters does, sure we can ask why that disparity exists. But that next step, where we round up the winner and round down the loser so that we now attribute all of the prejudice of that question to Trump supporters is the kind of divisive and wrong prejudice that we need to avoid. And this happens EVERYWHERE during polling and demographics discussions. Old people, young people, black people, educated people, climate denier, etc. We round general trends (some strong and some weak) into absolute extremes.

I don't think this approach is necessarily unjustified. For instance, one could make a plausible argument that Clinton's militancy or commitment to neoliberal policies outweighs Trump ostensive racism. On the other hand, I also think the plausibility of this kind of argument diminishes inversely to one's proximity to real acts of racism. Nevertheless, it is probably true that the majority of Trump voters voted for him despite his racism, not because of it, and that they still perceive his racism as to some degree problematic. \n\nMy point is that we should be conversing with this group of Trump voters and organizing with them to more effectively hold Trump accountable and defuse the offensives of the more insidious elements among his supporters. This is particularly true when he is appointing people like Bannon to key positions.\n\nYou make a great point about the prejudice that exists on the liberal side. The \"new atheists\" come immediately to mind. However, I don't think someone like Sam Harris is as bad as a David Duke (though I do think Harris has said some atrocious things). The term \"unfavorable\" in the survey question seems too ambiguous to demonstrate any equivalency here, and I would hesitate to make assert any more than a vague correspondence between thoroughly militant racists on the right and what I would term \"rationalist chauvinists\" (of which new atheists are a prime example) on the left.\n\nTo clarify, I might be inclined to say that I have an unfavorable view of Islam depending on what aspect of it I emphasize at the time I am questioned. Odds are I would express an unfavorable view. This does not mean I contest their right to exist like a white supremacist would. This is a crucial distinction. \n\nThat I may look \"unfavorably\" on Islam does not mean that I would not treat any particular Islamist with any less kindness or respect than I would anyone else. And I don't think you will find any white supremacists among Clinton voters, though stranger things have happened. We know you will find plenty (if not nearly ALL) of them on the Trump side.

Or is that question unanswerable?", "id": "d22spmr"}, {"comment": ">So.... if the Self isn't my thoughts/emotions/desires, then what is it exactly? Or is that question unanswerable?\n\nSense of self arises out of mind-wandering, according to many neuroscientists these days. Specifically, outof activity of the default mode network. See the review article: [Towards a Neuroscience of Mind-Wandering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3112331/)\n\nNormally, activity of the DJMN is associated with random thinking processes, and so sense-of-self is associated with random mental junk as well,  perceived as *my* thoughts, *my* desires, *my* plans, *my* actions, etc.\n\nHowever, there is a style of meditation, exemplified by TM, where the mind is allowed to wander as it will, with initial conditions set so that that wandering tends to *settle down* the random thoughts while still allowing any and all of them to occur.\n\nThe result is that the activity of the brain approaches a condition called _samadhi_ or \"pure consciousness\" (as discussed in the paper that obviously no-one read\u2122 as it goes into detail on this for many pages). Pure Consciousness is thought to emerge as the activity of the thalamus that regulates the thalamo-cortical feedback loops is inhibited, while the activity of the thalamus having to do with regulating lateral connections between distant cortical regions is left untouched. \n\nThis gives rise to a situation where the DMN and other resting state networks are fully active but not being stimulated by external sensory activity nor by internal sensory-feedback activity, so that their activity tends towards equilibrium. This is superficially similar to the LSD situation, except there is apparently no breakdown in distinction between one region and the next. Processing within each region, as far as anyone can tell, remains distinct. It merely tends to fade away, leaving only connectivity activity.\n\nThis situation of _samadhi_ is experienced as \"no experience\" and yet the activity of the brain is neither in dreaming nor sleeping nor any other typical \"unconscious\" mode. \n\nAll the activity found during TM practice tends to be found somewhere between the normal waking state activity and the pattern of activity associated with PC (with occasional periods of deep sleep and dreaming as well).\n\n[Again, this was discussed in great detail in the [theory & review paper (pdf)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederick_Travis/publication/261181813_Transcendental_experiences_during_meditation_practice/links/5487b1a00cf2ef34478ecd44.pdf) that no-one read\u2122 (linked  again for everyone's convenience to not-bother-to-read\u2122)]\n\n.\n\nOver time, various aspects of the physical functioning of the brain found during _samadhi_ start to become a trait outside of meditation, and as this trait becomes more pronounced, a \"pure\" sense-of-self, not associated with any specific activity, such as thinking, emoting, memories, planning, feeling, etc., starts to emerge.\n\nWhen this \"pure\" sense-of-self (call it \"Self\" for short) becomes a constant, present at all times, in all circumstances, whether one is awake, dreaming or deep asleep, one naturally starts to consider it the \"real\" sense-of-self, as it is the most constant thing present, while all things that people normally associate with sense-of-self, are viewed as \"not-Self.\"\n\nAt this point, by TM-theory, the person has become \"enlightened\" in the most preliminary stage. That [original link (pdf)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frederick_Travis/publication/261181813_Transcendental_experiences_during_meditation_practice/links/5487b1a00cf2ef34478ecd44.pdf) (which no-one read\u2122) discusses the above in greater detail, as well as the physiological research that has bee published on _samadhi_, and also summarizes the [psychological (pdf)](http://www.totalbrain.ch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/eeg-of-enlightenment.pdf)  and [physiological (pdf)](http://www.totalbrain.ch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/brain-integration-progress-report.pdf) research that has been published on people who report the constant presence of Self (whether awake, dreaming or deep asleep) continuously for at least a year.\n\n.\n\nFrom the [psychological study (pdf)](http://www.totalbrain.ch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/eeg-of-enlightenment.pdf) on people who are in the beginning stages of enlightenment, as defined by TM-theory, enlightened subjects (Self present 24 hours per day, even during deep sleep, for at least a year) were asked to \"_describe your self_\"). These were the responses of the enlightened subjects (2 groups of non-enlightened subjects were also studied, but results not included here):\n\n.\n\n* L1: We ordinarily think my self as this age; this color of hair; these hobbies . . . my experience is that my Self is a lot larger than that. It's immeasurably vast. . . on a physical level. It is not just restricted to this physical environment \n\n* L2: It's the \u2018\u2018I am-ness.\u2019\u2019 It's my Being. There's just a channel underneath that's just underlying everything. It's my essence there and it just doesn't stop where I stop. . . by \u2018\u2018I,\u2019\u2019 I mean this 5 ft. 2 person that moves around here and there\n\n\n* L3: I look out and see this beautiful divine Intelligence. . . you could say in the sky, in the tree, but really being expressed through these things. . . and these are my Self \n\n* L4: I experience myself as being without edges or content. . . beyond the universe. . . all-pervading, and being absolutely thrilled, absolutely delighted with every motion that my body makes. With everything that my eyes see, my ears hear, my nose smells. There's a delight in the sense that I am able to penetrate that. My consciousness, my intelligence pervades everything I see, feel and think \n\n* L5: When I say \u2019\u2019I\u2019\u2019 that's the Self. There's a quality that is so pervasive about the Self that I'm quite sure that the \u2018\u2018I\u2019\u2019 is the same \u2018\u2018I\u2019\u2019 as everyone else's \u2018\u2018I.\u2019\u2019 Not in terms of what follows right after. I am tall, I am short, I am fat, I am this, I am that. But the \u2018\u2018I\u2019\u2019 part. The \u2018\u2018I am\u2019\u2019 part is the same \u2018\u2018I am\u2019\u2019 for you and me\n\n.\n\nEdit: some of the above descriptions seem to go well beyond the criteria for the total-dichotomy of Self vs not-Self \"enlightenment,\" but there were only 17 subjects in the \"enlightened\" group, so no within-group analysis of the various styles of description could be done. A new study, with at least 51 \"enlightened\" subjects, is under way, so any physiological correlates for the non-dual-ish situations mentioned by some subjects above might be possible to determine with the new study.\n\n.\n\nNote that \"one with the universe\" isn't quite what is being described by the non-dual subjects. Different physiological situations in the brain lead to similar-sounding descriptions, but when you examine the description more closely, as well as the underlying physical mechanisms, you start to realize that one meditation tradition's \"non-dual experience\" may not be like another meditation tradition's non-dual experience at all. There's merely limitations of language that make it sound that way on a superficial level.\n\n\n\n", "id": "d2356vh"}, {"comment": "meditation is fascinating ", "id": "d251fb9"}, {"comment": "I believe the Self is consciousness - the awareness of awareness.

I don't really believe in a \"self\" that is separate from the body or the brain (ie. a soul).

The software can only do so much; sure it can run an analysis for you, but it cannot tell you which analysis to run--and so few people actually understand their data enough to answer the latter question. In my work, we tend to immediately disregard about 90% of neuroimaging papers for poor methods. So, to find out that the software had problems wouldn't really change the fact that people were doing it wrong in so many other ways to begin with.\n\nBut here's the good news: nobody really reads one paper and accepts it as fact. A lot of what we've learned from neuroimaging, we've only accepted as \"truth\" after 10+ studies have provided converging evidence. At a certain point, we know the false positive rate cannot account for this. Of course, pop psychology tends to overstate what we learn from a single, poorly-done fMRI experiment (after all, how could they know what's right and wrong), but 95% of that is dismissed by neuroscientists who know what they're doing. \n\nBeyond that, the leaders in the field do a great job of \"cleaning up\" the field, so that while there is lots of faulty work out there, there are also lots of people complaining about the poor work and making sure the field knows how to continue moving forward. There is *constant* discussion about the validity and meaningfulness of fMRI work; it's never out of mind for people who do this sort of work. \n\nFurther, (good) cognitive neuroscientists will never rely solely on neuroimaging. Instead, they will only accept that an area of the brain is causally and selectively involved in a process after they've found converging evidence across 1) imaging, 2) patients with brain lesions and 3) other methods like TMS. Also, a lot of ideas tend to be theory-driven; it's not as if a person randomly decides to look for activation in an arbitrary swathe of cortex.\n\nAnd one final reason that we needn't worry: the top neuroscientists in the field (from what I've seen) refuse to rely on these statistical packages. They create their own software from the bottom-up. So even if a lot of people are getting it wrong, the people that the field looks up to are, generally speaking, doing it well enough. \n\nHope this answers your question.", "id": "d52yiz7"}, {"comment": "The more time I spend in academia the more I realize how bad most science is.

While it may fit our cultural narrative, it's contrary to a huge body of research indicating that religiousness is associated with prosociality (in certain circumstances, for certain people).  \n\nShariff, Willard, Muthukrishna, Kramer & Henrich published a response to the Decety et al. piece that this article is about.  They show that Decety's analytic strategy led to their results, and that analyzing the data differently produces very different conclusions (ones that are consistent with all of the other data on this subject).\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27505237", "id": "d9q8ddq"}, {"comment": "> Given that previous studies (for example 6, 7 and 8) have shown cross-national variation in Dictator Game behavior, Decety et al. [1]\u2019s approach of aiming to include country-level fixed effects in their analysis, to account for mean differences among countries, is sensible. But when they included their categorically-coded country (1 = US, 2 = Canada, and so on) in their models, it was entered not as fixed effects, with dummy variables for all of the countries except one, but as a continuous measure. This treats the variable as a measure of \u2018country-ness\u2019 (for example, Canada is twice as much a country as the US) instead of providing the fixed effects they explicitly intended. We have repeated Decety et al. [1]\u2019s intended analysis by using actual fixed effects, along with their model specifications, and then explored other plausible specifications and modelling approaches. Our analyses reveal meaningfully different results from those originally reported.\n\n>Decety et al. [1] report that children from religious \u2014 especially Muslim \u2014 households recommend more punishment of a moral transgressor than do children from non-religious households. Using the same model specification as Decety et al. [1], but including dummy-codes for country (with USA as the referent), we find little support for this; no effect of household religious affiliation emerged (\u03b2 = \u20130.03, t(774) = \u20130.31, p = 0.75). Because Decety et al. [1]\u2019s ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis is not ideal for the highly negatively-skewed distribution of punishment ratings, we also estimated a model using the log of the reverse-scored punishment values; this similarly yielded no effect (\u03b2 = 0.00, t(774) = 0.14, p = 0.89).\n\n> Conducting Decety et al. [1]\u2019s intended analysis also finds no support for their conclusion that more religious parents report their children having more empathy and sensitivity to injustices. When country is entered as fixed, Decety et al. [1]\u2019s model specification reveals no relationship between religiosity and either empathy (\u03b2 = 0.04, t(764) = 1.15, p = 0.25) or justice ratings (\u03b2 = \u20130.03, t(767) = \u20130.57, p = 0.57; Table S1 in the Supplemental Information).\n\n> Decety et al. [1]\u2019s primary claims concern children\u2019s altruistic behavior in the Dictator Game. Here again, our reanalysis using Decety et al. [1]\u2019s intended specifications calls their conclusions into question. The fixed effects model shows no significant effect for religious affiliation on generosity (OLS Model 2: p = 0.70; Table 1), though we do observe effects for age, country and (marginally) socio-economic status. However, Decety et al. [1]\u2019s OLS model is poorly suited for the many zero offers in the data. To address this, we used a zero-inflated negative binomial regression, but still, no relationship with religious affiliation emerged. Indeed, within no single country was household religious affiliation a significant predictor of generosity (though sample sizes, and thus statistical power, are reduced; Table S2). Finally, given the overlap between country and religious affiliation, we also estimated a random effects model, which yields similar results (Table 1).\n\n> Though generosity appears unrelated to household religious affiliation, Decety et al. [1]\u2019s dataset does reveal generosity to be negatively related to both household religious frequency (OLS: \u03b2 = \u20130.26, t(789) = \u20132.38, p = 0.02; zero-inflated: \u03b2 = \u20130.07, z = \u20132.13, p = 0.03), and intrinsic religiosity (OLS: \u03b2 = \u20130.19, t(792) = \u20131.81, p = 0.07; zero-inflated: \u03b2 = \u20130.06, z = \u20132.05, p = 0.04; country-by-country breakdown in Table S2). However, the effect is quite small: an increase in religiosity of 1 SD resulted in 6\u20137% lower odds of sharing stickers (roughly 0.2 fewer stickers); see also Table S2.\n\n> In sum, Decety et al. [1] have amassed a large and valuable dataset, but our reanalyses provide different interpretations of the authors\u2019 initial conclusions. Most of the associations they observed with religious affiliation appear to be artifacts of between-country differences, driven primarily by low levels of generosity in Turkey and South Africa. However, children from highly religious households do appear slightly less generous than those from moderately religious ones.\n", "id": "d9q8iub"}, {"comment": "I would add that the Sharrif et al.

[Why not simply do away with the need for detention in the first place](http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/san-francisco-schools-transformed-power-meditation-n276301)?\n\nIncidentally, the current Superintendent of Public Schools *and* his predecessor have been trying to get TM taught at all public schools in SF for the past 8 years.\n\nMeanwhile, [in Rio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abiOrpuHQ5s), the city has had the entire 1 million public school population on the waiting list to learn TM for 6 years, and negotiations are ongoing with the federal government to have at lest 48,000 public school teachers--one per public school in Brazil--trained as TM teachers so that all 45 million public school students can learn TM for free.\n\n", "id": "d8376ox"}, {"comment": "Because school is not separate from the rest of the world so there is probably no way to completely do away with the need for detention solely through school. ", "id": "d83umzs"}, {"comment": ">Because school is not separate from the rest of the world so there is probably no way to completely do away with the need for detention solely through school. \n\nSchool is where kids spend most of their time, 5 days a week.\n\nThe DLF quiet time program that I linked to involves Transcendental Meditation. TM is a relaxation technique with one extremely important feature that makes it far more effective than what you might expect: the consistency of the changes that take place during the practice mean that the changes start to become a trait outside of practice. TM enhances and changes normal mind-wandering rest so that normal mind-wandering rest becomes more enhanced *outside of practice* as well. \n\nThe brain switches gears approximately every 1/10 of a second throughout the day. A good portion of that time, even when you are engaged \"fully\" from your perspective, your brain is actually in resting mode. Normally this is viewed as mind-wandering because the system is so noisy, but TM reduces the noise during meditation, and eventually outside of meditation, so that this resting period interferes less and less with whatever you are paying attention to.\n\nThe long-term trend is in the direction of paying attention better, resting more efficiently, AND not getting as upset with whatever is going on around you because you are only getting upset at what is going on currently, with less and less of your stress reaction to the current situation being dictated by \"left-over\" stress-reaction due to past experience.\n\nDo you see where I'm going with this? People's reaction to ongoing situations is usually so bound up with their past experiences that their current reactions are never optimal, and they tend to drag around previous experiences for hours/days/weeks/months/years/decades, sometimes, to the point that they cannot move on -this is most obvious in PTSD, which a lot of kids have, especially in the schools the DLF is invited into.\n\nRegular TM practice starts to create a \"safe haven\" in the minds of these kids that they start to carry around with them in daily life, even when they are not in school. This means that, almost certainly, in the long run, their reaction to their world is going to be less-stressed, more sane, and so, in the long-run, detention issues will become less and less. \n\nThe effects of TM are cross-cultural. A Roman Catholic priest in Colombia [rescues child-prostitutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4sS3tHvQRQ&t=5s) off the streets of Medellin and the government of Colombia gives the child-rebels (forced at gunpoint to shoot people as part of their initiation into the rebel cause) that it captures into his care for rehabilitation. Said priest uses TM and related practices to help alleviate the pervasive PTSD, and the results [are astounding enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoKEUV4Ivwo) that the Roman Catholic Church maintains a \"hands off\" policy on the methods of the priest, even [the REALLY bizarre ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoKEUV4Ivwo) -you can't argue with a 75% rehabilitation rate.\n\nOn the other side of the world, a Buddhist nun who runs the only free, all-girls Buddhist boarding school in Thailand, uses TM and related practices to help her students, [with similar outcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCd7CfME2J8).\n\nThe point is that rest is universal, and the effects of the brain resting more efficiently than before are also universal -and more efficient resting can become a  trait that persists indefinitely outside of meditation, which means detention issues should be come less and less, regardless of the circumstances that a kid has been in outside of school.\n\nAs this happens, the school's resources can be directed in ways that are more effective in dealing with specific kids, rather than to a one-size-fits-all approach called \"detention.\"", "id": "d84k4xj"}, {"comment": "When I say \"completely do away with the need for detention\", I might have worded it wrong. I advocate for  TM instead of detention. What I meant is that you can't hope to not need to \"repair\" behaviors, be it by detention in classic cases, or TM in your ideal. \n\nAnother thing is, TM, just like any other practice, is embeded in life. You most probably don't get the same results from meditation when it's embeded in different contexts. \n\nYou stated it yourself, it's 75% rehabilitation rate, meaning it does not always work, and that is most probably because those 25% live in such conditions that even TM is not enough. \n\nThen again, you probably misunderstood my position, I'm did not mean we should not use TM, I meant it's incomplete and we also need to adress the problems that are outside of school if we are to correct such issues.

TM has been taught to war refugees and HIV+ individuals living under bushes or under bridges with great success. It had monumental success in the federal prison system in Senegal, West Africa, where a prison warden's most brag-worthy accomplishment for the year was raising the money to put doors on the prison outhouses (privacy is *extremely* important in Muslim countries).\n\nIf a situation is due (or mostly due) to stress, then TM can have a very good effect -the more stress, the more noticeable the difference once TM is added. But not all behavior problems are due to stress. But that was my point about resources being freed up for student-specific issues: if TM can reduce or even eliminate (eventually) the stress-related behavioral issues, then those issues that remainare likely NOT due to stress and the school will have more resources available to address those on a case-by-case basis, and probably detention isn't suitable for such cases, either.

", "id": "d84np2q"}, {"comment": "> Have you got scientific results stating quantitative and qualitative data of TM ? \n> \n\nTL;DR: While attempting to answer your question, I ran across [this 2015 review paper on meditation and education](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10648-014-9258-2) which, not surprisingly from my perspective, singles out TM... Likewise, this [2013 scientific statement for doctors (pdf)](http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/hypertensionaha/early/2013/04/22/HYP.0b013e318293645f.full.pdf) from the American Heart Association singles out TM as the only practice having sufficiently good research with sufficiently consistent effects that the AHA can say that Doctors may recommend it to their patients as a secondary treatment for high blood pressure, while no other meditation or relaxation practice made the the grade (see page 6).\n\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\nJust about all meditation research, be it on TM or the Relaxation Response or mindfulness, or whatever, is done by Believers, which could include people who make millions by selling 40 editions of their best-selling book over a 40-year period, so you have to take everything every speck of existing research on every meditation practice says with a bit of salt.\n\nThat said, the TM organization has been publishing research on TM since 1970, when R. Keith Wallace got his [PhD thesis research on TM published in _Science_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5416544) and they have been attempting to get non-TMing researchers involved in studying TM, ever since.\n\nFor example, the David Lynch Foundation [conducted 2 tiny pilot studies on war refugees living in Uganda](https://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/africa.html), a few years ago, and now the United Nations has commissioned its own independent research on TM and PTSD to see if the results in the pilot studies can be validated. The hope of the DLF is that eventually, UN disaster relief workers will be trained as TM teachers and teach TM as part of their regular duties.\n\nIn San Francisco, the DLF has been teaching TM for over 8 years at select schools. The result is, even though other schools are using mindfulness with good results, the outgoing superintendent of SFUSD, [Richard Caranza](http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Meditation-transforms-roughest-San-Francisco-5136942.php) and his predecessor, [Carlos Garcia](https://youtu.be/eF69ske9kBM?t=79) are both very much in favor of TM becoming more widespread in SFUSD, based on the school district's own statistics, not some TM researcher's study.\n>Because untill then I'm pretty skeptical as I have heard contradictory information on this.\n\nThe DLF Quiet TIme has run into fierce opposition by a handful of people. I assert it is a handful of people, because their facebook page has all of 36 likes: https://www.facebook.com/SF-Parents-Against-TM-in-Public-Schools-201123776750702/ and I suspect it is that tiny group that Carlos Garcia singled out in the video above.\n\nSimilar anti-TM groups make mountains out of molehills in other ways, as well. For example, [this page](http://minet.org/www.trancenet.net/research/index.shtml) quotes a study by the government showing that TMers are almost all dishonest, etc. What they page won't tell you, and you have to dig deep, is that the study is a survey on individuals selected *because* they don't like TM: http://minet.org/www.trancenet.net/research/chap2.shtml#2.1\n\nAs any scientist will tell you, such a survey simply *cannot* allow you to draw conclusions about the larger group of people who learn TM.\n\n\n> Also, I'm still pretty sure that not all problems in the world can be adressed by school. \n\nSchool is where kids learn to become adults. Think about it. In modern society, kids spend more time in school than anywhere else. If not school, where are kids going to go? TV? The Internet? Hanging with friends while playing video games?\n\nTM allows kids to become more of who they are sans stress. Quite literally, that is all it is meant to be. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of TM, defined the first stage of \"enlightenment\" as \"merely normal\" -where the stresses that prevent a person from being who they would have become--sans stress--have dropped away, revealing the real person.\n\nIt's possible that TM isn't for everyone, but that is where peer-reviewed, independently conducted research comes in. The TM organization puts its best foot forward. People who don't like TM try to find the worst examples associated with TM, due to TM or no. Without independent research, you can never be certain of who is right in this situation. \n\nThat said, the David Lynch Foundation is teaching entire schools and school districts to meditate and inviting governments to monitor the results. After 100,000+ students in Oaxaca, Mexico learned TM for free over the past several years, the state government recently announced that TM is now a required subject at all public schools based on their own evaluations of the results.\n\nThroughout Latin America, the DLF is [building meditation halls/classrooms](http://fundaciondavidlynch.org/proyectos-en-marcha/construccion-de-escuelas) and teaching 10's of thousands of students for free and inviting the national governments to monitor the results.\n\nIn fact, based on the results of government-conducted studies throughout Latin America, the DLF is now projecting that about 100 million people will learn TM for free  over the next decade or so, taught by government employees (teachers, counselors, medical professionals, prison guards, etc) trained as TM teachers, teaching TM as part of their regular duties.\n\n[If the entire student body of major cities ends up learning and practicing TM at school](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abiOrpuHQ5s), it may be that you will need to rethink your assertion.", "id": "d84s50j"}, {"comment": "I'll read the rest of the comment later, but while skimming it, something stroke me, showing that I was right to point at the fact that school is not the center of the universe, because it seems you think so.

Because they also spend over thousands of hours OUTSIDE of school, and just because they spend most of the time at school does not make school the very center of the universe and the only place where kids spend meaningful time. The internet, games, TV, hanging with friends (btw a huge chunk of the time at school is spent socializing), but also sports for instance, are meaningful in a kid's learning, identity building, and so on.\n\n Ever heard of situated learning and communitirs of practice ?

Our rational faculties are precisely what allow us to recognize \"rationalization\".

For example, fmri on mindfulness practitioners shows that they become less sensitive to pain -they managed to keep their hands in hot water  longer before reporting it was too hot to keep it in. A similar study done on TMers found that while TMers jerked their hand out of the hot water at the same temperature as the non-TMers, the fmri showed that their stress-response ([whole brain reaction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2170475/)) was 540-0% less than the control's. The controls were then taught TM and within a few months, showed the same 40-50% reduction in stress-response, even though they still jerked their hand out of the water at the same temperature as before.\n\nMindfulness, according to tradition, reduces sense-of-self, which would be ideal for cannon fodder as they start to think of themselves as not-a-person (self-immolation and self-mummification are celebrated amongst many Buddhists as amazing examples of how enlightened the suicide perpetrators were). The fact that mindfulness practices [reduce activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4054695/) in the default mode network, [thought by many](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3112331/) to be responsible for sense-of-self, seems to support this traditional view.\n\n TM, on the other hand, is meant to *enhance* sense-of-self, and tends to [increase activity in the DMN](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19862565), which seems to support the claims from the spiritual tradition it is derived from.\n\nIronically, mindfulness practice  reduces the ability of the brain to spontaneously wander, which is associated with  [a diminished capacity for what people normally call creativity](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00834/full).  TM, on the other hand, is [meant to enhance normal mind-wandering rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjem4YfJGQI) and make it more efficient. [Research on people practicing the TM-Sidhis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=creativity+tm-sidhis) (meant to stabilize the effects of TM outside of meditation practice] shows enhanced creativity, and in fact, when [transcranial magnetic stimulation in the principle EEG frequency associated with TM and related practices was applied to subjects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913062), they became more creative, at least temporarily, while stimulation using other frequencies has no effect. Anecdotally, the number of world-famous creative people who have been practicing TM since childhood is quite astonishing: the number of 20-40-year TMers who have risen to the top of their careers and stayed there is probably at least 10x as great as you would expect from chance, as there were less than one million people practicing TM 40 years ago, o, while there are literally hundreds of top-of-their-field TMers who learned TM as children or young adults, 40 years ago..\n\nOne fun recent finding on mindfulness practice is evidence that [mindfulness practitioners tend to be more prone to false memories](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=false+memories+mindfulness). There's no research on TM and false memories that I am aware of, but ironically, in the paper on how \"all\" meditation suppresses the activity of the default mode network, the researchers cite a paper on TM to support their claim. This is odd as the TM paper they cite explicitly says that TM appears to *increase* the activity of the DMN -the researchers generated their own interpretation of what they were reading (created a false memory) rather than reading what was really on the page (I linked to both papers to contrast the claim about mindfulness and the claim about TM -the mindfulness researchers ALSO linked to that same paper, claiming the opposite of what that paper says in the abstract -the head researcher of the TM paper was quite bemused when I pointed it out to him).\n\nThat last highlights the real difference between TM and mindfulness: TM allows the mind to do its thing, while mindfulness attempts to train the brain to change in the direction of paying better attention to whatever you are already paying attention to, giving rise to a situation where the brain fails to note changes in the outside world because it is too busy paying attention to the model it has already developed.\n\n.\n\nSo, which is better for a solider? Being more relaxed and able to cope with pain and stress, or being unable to even notice that pain has occurred? Being able to adapt to new situations, or being unable to notice that a new situation has arisen? Capable of being spontaneously creative or only capable of being analytic? And most importantly, which is better, retaining the ability to see yourself as human, or starting to see yourself  as some abstract *thing*?\n\n\n", "id": "d835ce7"}, {"comment": "On the military question, asking soldiers to meditate to deal with battle stress is good.

Wealthy people that see behavioral health professionals are people with problems.  They have broken marriages, fucked up children, fucked up inner worlds.  Having money or being functional enough to earn a lot of money does not discredit a person from having real problems and experiencing real suffering from them.\n\nOrganized, goal-oriented people are going to try to combat that problem with professional help.  And in a field where help comes in many shapes and forms, where finding efficacy can be such a nebulous process, they're going to pay top dollar to find the best help.  That's all there is to it.\n\nAny society that allows a practitioner to go private will have this happening.

There are others which are less  commonly used and will not be discussed here.\n\n Any of these can be used in the game of \"Psychiatry,\" which is based on the position \"I am a healer,\" supported by a diploma: \"It says here I am a healer.\" It will be noted that in any case this is a constructive, benevolent position, and that people who play \"Psychiatry\" can do a great deal of good, providing they are professionally trained.  It is likely, however, that there will be some gain in therapeutic results if therapeutic ardor is moderated. The antithesis was best expressed long ago by Ambroise Par\u00a3, who said in effect: \"I treat them, but God cures them.\" Every medical student learns about this dictum, along with others  such as primium non nocere, and phrases such as vis medicatrix naturae. Nonmedical therapists, however, are not likely to be exposed -to these ancient cautions.\n\n The position \"I am a healer because it says here that I am a healer\" is likely to be an impairment, and may be replaced to advantage with something like: \"I will apply what therapeutic procedures I have learned in the hope that they will be of some benefit.\" This avoids the possibility of games based on: \"Since I am a healer, if you don't get better it's your fault\" (e.g., \"I'm Only Trying To Help You\" or \"Since you're a healer, I'll get better for you\" (e.g., \"Peasant\"). All of this, of course, is known in principle to every conscientious therapist. Certainly every therapist who has ever presented a case at a reputable clinic has been made aware of it.

I spend half of my time creating and implementing treatment and the other half arguing with myself, colleagues, and boss about whether this specific instance requires involuntary confinement. I literally am up at night thinking about whether I was right to let someone be released. It's not that I'm always on one side or the other but I am always bring up the question. I do also err on the side of civil rights as opposed to public safety. Among my colleagues I am more likely to move someone up and out but not by a significant margins. Our actual discharge numbers probably aren't that different. Okay, that's me. Now on to your statement.  \n\nThat question by the way isn't whether you are delusional or psychotic. We release people who are actively psychotic every day. My criteria, and that everywhere in the US, is whether there is an imminent serious harm to the individual or others. Each one of those words I grapple with and I know that when it comes to risk assessment as a field we suck. I mean we're better than chance and better than anyone else but it's pitiful how low a bar that is. We also, at least myself and my facility and my state, are pushing for improvements in that knowledge and in applying that knowledge to practice. We are continually adjusting our assessments to be more accurate which  means focusing only on factors related to actual risk.   \n\nIt takes a fair amount to be hospitalized for longer than 3 days and very few are only hospitalized involuntarily for such a short time. Most people need longer and if it's more than 3 days you usually have to prove it to your hospital and a judge. Admittedly, the system is significantly inclined to believe the mental health professional but the question isn't whether this person is delusion it's whether or not they are dangerous. The instances of subtle delusions or hallucinations is very small. It's rarely a question of \"if\" but dangerous is much harder to define.   \n\nThere is a downside to choosing autonomy over treatment. I currently have a client who is delusional but very well put together. She is one of the very subtle cases. She has been found not guilty by reason of insanity so the criminal court and governor's panel have direct say over her privileges. We know, based on overheard comments and what she posts online, that she is delusional but her outward behavior is only risky and inappropriate not disorganized and dangerous. We applied for judicial authorization to medicate her (something we rarely have to do because most people consent or we respect that they do not absolutely need meds to be safe). We were denied based on how she presented in court and frankly I'm not surprised. She hides her symptoms well. In the the last few weeks she has been off meds her behavior and mood has worsened. It is only a matter of time before her symptoms have fully returned and are interfering with her ability to function well even within the hospital. It will probably take months to get that bad and months to bring her back. During that time her life is being wasted and her chances or recovery diminish. With meds, she had a decent chance to make significant improvements but we have to wait until she fully decompensates. I get why that is and I wouldn't change the system but it's a tragedy for her.   \n\nI could and do talk about this all day. I write 20 page reports on each of my clients detailing why and how I know they are safe or why they are not. Often I am arguing that they are safe but I know it's only a matter of time before I'm wrong and someone will be killed. With the clients I have now, it will likely be someone in the community. I worry so much about it but still side with people making their own decisions more often than not because I know that statistically as a field we are over cautious.  \n\nAs a final note for anyone reading this you should know that my clients are in the minority of those who suffer from mental illness. The vast, vast majority will never be hospitalized and those hospitalizations will be brief. Additionally those with mental illness are much less likely to be the perpetrator of a crime than they are a victim.

I can hypothesize about what may have likely happened. There are a couple of things that help explain this. First, ERs do not usually provide good psych care. They do so many other things that you usually never keep you there for long so they send you to a special unit or hospital. The reason why you likely weren't is next. Second, eating disorders have a surprisingly high mortality rate. The only time we refer patients to a traditional hospital is when we have fear about physical condition. Third, a panic attack that last consistently for several days is unusual and troubling. \n\nIn your case you were obviously in extreme distress, unable to provide information about what you could do to keep safe, and physically compromised in a manner that is difficult to predict. With ED so many of the problems are sudden (heart, loss of conscious, etc.).    \n\nI assume that hospitalization is a significant stressor for all my patients even if they do not seem to be in distress. I know there are parts of hospitalization that are significantly iatrogenic (treatment that is harmful). This is why we only insist when there is a likelihood of harm.

There are others which are less  commonly used and will not be discussed here.\n\n Any of these can be used in the game of \"Psychiatry,\" which is based on the position \"I am a healer,\" supported by a diploma: \"It says here I am a healer.\" It will be noted that in any case this is a constructive, benevolent position, and that people who play \"Psychiatry\" can do a great deal of good, providing they are professionally trained.  It is likely, however, that there will be some gain in therapeutic results if therapeutic ardor is moderated. The antithesis was best expressed long ago by Ambroise Par\u00a3, who said in effect: \"I treat them, but God cures them.\" Every medical student learns about this dictum, along with others  such as primium non nocere, and phrases such as vis medicatrix naturae. Nonmedical therapists, however, are not likely to be exposed -to these ancient cautions.\n\n The position \"I am a healer because it says here that I am a healer\" is likely to be an impairment, and may be replaced to advantage with something like: \"I will apply what therapeutic procedures I have learned in the hope that they will be of some benefit.\" This avoids the possibility of games based on: \"Since I am a healer, if you don't get better it's your fault\" (e.g., \"I'm Only Trying To Help You\" or \"Since you're a healer, I'll get better for you\" (e.g., \"Peasant\").

I've talked to them about this kind of technology in the past, and one of the thoughts we had was it might be possible to have some sort of opt-in program for social media where it looks at general trends, and if it detects certain behaviour, sends a message to them and possibly a trusted loved one just reminding them to check in with themselves, or their mental health professional if need be.\n\nYou can already look at graphs of some things like posting frequency on facebook/twitter, or word clouds during certain periods and glean that there's some information that, if not 100% accurate in predicting a manic/hypomanic episode, still is a good indication that someone should check in. As this kind of technology gets more robust, you could be looking at things like music preferences (one tipoff for one of my friends is that she starts listening to a lot of metal and a lot of classical music at the same time, whereas normally there's less classical and more indie rock), how Web browsing habits change, how gaming habits change, social media, etc.\n\nThis SOUNDS extremely intrusive, but remember we already do all of these things for advertising. I don't mean to employ a \"not as bad as\" fallacy either - a lot of people are just okay with that level of intrusion, and as I stated previously this would be an opt in program.\n\nOf course,  it could also be used by institutions to scan for those who might be developing mental illnesses without consent.\n\nEither way, there are a lot of ways this *kind* of technology could be useful.

This paper addresses the idea proposed by Kaplan et al. that this pattern arises because high-SES fathers and fathers of sons can make more difference to offspring outcomes. Using a large longitudinal British dataset, I show that paternal involvement in childhood has positive associations with offspring IQ at age 11, and offspring social mobility by age 42, though not with numbers of grandchildren. For IQ, there is an interaction between father's SES and his level of involvement, with high-SES fathers making more difference to the child's IQ by their investment than low-SES fathers do. The effects of paternal investment on the IQ and social mobility of sons and daughters were the same.

This is always the goal, in the same way the goal of a diet researcher who finds a correlation between eating blueberries and less cancer is not a purely abstract interest in finding correlations & contemplating a correlation matrix, but to make specific recommendations like 'everyone should eat more fruit'.

The quotes you provided were presumably from an interview\n\nSo literally the original researcher here, quoted on record as drawing causal inferences, is not enough? I even extracted the relevant parts of the article and highlighted the causal language and claims for you... It's just a 'huge unfounded assumption'? But I also linked the fulltext of the paper, where you can see that the journalist is in no way misquoting Nettle and Nettle is in fact arguing throughout the entire paper that this is causal; some random quotes:\n\n> ...Nonetheless, the overall implication of this large literature is that, at the very least, paternal involvement is associated with improved offspring outcomes, and quite possibly, the association is causal....This study shows for the first time an interaction effect with father's SES, with professional and managerial fathers making more difference to child IQ scores when they invest than unskilled fathers do (see Fig. 3). High-SES fathers may have more skills to enrich and improve the environment of the child's development than low-SES fathers do. As Kaplan et al. (1998) suggested might be the case, high SES fathers seem to be more efficient at embodying human capital in their children than low-SES fathers are. This gives a powerful potential explanation of why low-SES groups are characterised by low paternal effort. The returns to effort are low, and therefore men have no incentive for higher effort....The study found no evidence that investments by fathers in sons were more effective than those made in daughters....However, if the associations found here are interpreted as reflecting the consequences of paternal investment, they suggest that the relatively low-investment behaviour of low- SES men, rather than being aberrant, is in some sense adaptive, since the benefit\u2013cost ratio for their investment is less favourable than that experienced by higher-SES men.\n\nSo he's a researcher in a field eddicated to assuming correlation=causality and where almost all the research and interventions are based on this idea; he uses causal language in the abstract and explicitly argues at the start of the pape that it's probably causal; the entire analysis, including the evolutionary speculation about investment, is predicated on theories about it being causal (eg asking whether parental investment has nonlinear payoffs with SES presupposes that the investment is causally making a difference rather than reflecting heredity); he says it's causal while talking to the reporter; he ignores the century old research literature implying most of it is non-causal... Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck.\n\nBy the way, check out the Discussion section on limitations:\n\n> This dataset, though large and socially representative, does have limitations, which mean that caveats are in order. The crudeness and skewedness of the measure mean significant variation in paternal investment will go undetected, though this tends to militate against finding effects rather than making it likely that they will be spuriously detected. The Introduction mentioned three main methodological issues which studies of this type tend to face: reliance on the same informant for the independent and outcome variables, associations of paternal involvement with other family characteristics, and reverse causality from offspring characteristics to paternal behaviour. This study is not prone to the first problem, as paternal involvement was assessed from mothers' reports, whilst IQ was independently tested and adult outcomes are reported by the cohort members themselves.\n\nReally? Some measurement error and reverse causation is *all* he can think of which might mean the correlation is non-causal...? (Not once are genetics or heritability of intelligence mentioned.

Suppose you were reading about a particular class of psychiatric drugs, which decades of research had established always came with a large placebo effect. The drugs might or might not work beyond that, but there is definitely a placebo effect with them. Then a journalist calls you excitedly about a new study indicating that the drugs worked, because a survey of thousands of patients using the drugs reported large benefits, and advocacy organizations were using this new study to lobby for greater reimbursement for these drugs and making them free for patients, because mental disease can be so horrible and have lifelong consequences. You ask whether that study involved any kind of placebo control. Oh, no, it didn't. Would it be unfair to tell that journalist that, unfortunately, the study can be dismissed out of hand because it is not evidence for the drugs working, since these survey results are exactly what you would expect to see if it was placebo effect or if the drugs worked?\n\nOr let's draw another analogy. When a diet researcher takes a national survey and finds blueberries correlate with heart disease or something and then writes her paper using only causal language and tells the journalist causal things, this is bad but entirely psychologically understandable (you go into health research because you want to make people healthier, and your research is being funded by the government on the entirely understandable hope that someday it might help people be healthier) and you can't say it's *totally* ridiculous, because hey, maybe blueberries really do reduce heart disease? Why not? But when that diet researcher finds that blueberry consumption correlates with retardation or developmental disorders (where genetics research has already established a large fraction, if not most such cases, are due to mutations) and then her paper talks about blueberries protecting against developmental disorders and never mentions genetics and Big Blueberry industry organizations start advocating for blueberry supplementation because research shows it has effects on developmental disorders... then something has gone seriously, seriously, wrong.\n\n> Having an opinion like that on this paper really just suggests you don't understand the difference between exploratory research and inferential statistics.\n\nHow I hate that excuse: 'oh, it's just exploratory. Why are you upset by me running a few hundred different specifications to find something with a lot of stars? Don't you understand how science works? We come up with hypotheses and then we test them. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go do a dozen more regressions on my latest exploratory dataset.'\n\nThis happens all the time in psychology; it's truly infuriating to me to watch a researcher experimentally test something, like dual n-back WM training, find a non-significant result as predicted by the meta-analysis (because there is not actually any real effect from the intervention), and immediately proceed to start chopping and dicing the covariates in an 'exploratory' analysis until they can find a subgroup or predictor of 'gains', which they'll take as proof they've discovered an important moderator (personality, nationality, intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation, gender, baseline ability; all have been brought up) and that n-back works after all, and then of course either the followup studies won't replicate it or they won't even check.\n\nAnd this isn't exploratory, even if we bought the distinction...

For example, parents' socioeconomic background influences the frequency with which they enter marital relationships (with lower income parents entering marriage less frequently, Gibson-Davis, Edin & McLanahan, 2005), which impacts the stability of low income families. Also, lower income, less educated individuals are more likely to reproduce with other low income, less educated individuals, which has implications for the genetic makeup of offspring.

But again, that's an incorrect distinction.  Psychiatry is the field that concerns itself with the treatment of mental disorders, and \"psychiatric treatment\" refers to any sort of treatment of mental disorders.  While most psychiatrists primarily practice pharmacotherapy (that's a bit of a tongue twister), they also utilize other treatment approaches, such as psychotherapeutical, psychoeducational, and psychosocial treatments.  Likewise, while most psychologists practice psychotherapy, there are also psychologists who practice psychopharmacology, and plenty more who work within the biomedical framework as researchers.  Neuropsychologists, for example, are clinicians who work within the neurocognitive model, and spend a good portion of their time thinking about neuroanatomy.\n\nI'm a clinical psychologist who works in the psychiatry department of a medical hospital, which is where psychologists typically work in hospitals.  I hold a clinical faculty appointment as a professor of psychiatry and psychology in the hospital's affiliated medical school, which again, is typical for attending-level psychologists who work in this kind of setting.  This is because as clinical psychologists, we're providing psychiatric care to our patients.  We may be using a psychological treatment modality, but what we're doing is treating psychiatric disorders.  Our diagnostic manual is written by psychiatrists, and is a manual of psychiatric disorders (not \"psychological\" ones).\n\nI'd be interested to see research that draws a distinction between \"psychiatric\" and \"psychological/behavioral\" treatments.  Typically, the distinction would be made between psychological/behavioral and \"pharmacological/psychopharmacological/biomedical\" treatments.  Those latter terms are used to avoid confusion, since psychiatric treatment can include psychotherapy.  There may be some research that conflates the two, but in clinical settings you'll hear the terms used as I'm using them.\n\nAnyway, this is certainly a pedantic argument, but I simply wanted to address the distinction you drew between psychiatric and psychological treatment.  Also, not to stir up even more of an argument, but I do want to respond to your claim that we don't have effective pharmacological treatments for anxiety.  It is definitely true that our psychotherapeutic treatments have been shown to be more efficacious than our pharmacological ones, but there are certain scenarios where medication can be quite effective for anxiety.  Medications like clonidine and propranolol can be helpful for people with PTSD, for example, and in some cases for those who experience social anxiety.  And while they don't have a great track record, SSRIs can help with GAD and social anxiety as well.

It's a move *against* the medical model, which includes terminology that has been colloquially deemed medical in nature. It's whatever.\n\nStir up arguments, that's how people are forced to think critically and defend perspectives, no? I use phobias and panic as examples of where medications are often iatrogenic, but I would expand that statement to all anxiety disorders really. Aside from GAD, anxiety disorders share pretty much the same etiological factors, they are simply focused on different things. Panic, phobia, OCD, SAD, etc., it's all the same in terms of exposing to a fear stimulus/situation and then withholding safety behaviors.

Paradoxically, it just often creates more problems as they will typically end up avoiding situations (e.g., job interview) because they end up ruminating their time away. This is an avoidance behavior in that it does downregulate anxiety/deprive the individual of \"approach\" behaviors (e.g., engagement in worry situations).\n\nHypervigilance could be theorized similarly in the sense of demanding control over one's environment. So, it's suggested to be a safety behavior in the same way that checking compulsions in OCD might be: a constant surveillance of the environment to clear it of any threat.\n\nThe snake oil salesmen of EMDR have done amazingly in terms of fooling the greater public of its efficacy. EMDR is supposedly comprised of two components: exposure to trauma + eye movement exercises. What's important to recognize here is that we have a treatment (multiple) which rely on exposure to trauma already (e.g., prolonged exposure [PE]). So the question one would be interested in knowing is: well how does EMDR compare to exposure-alone? Mathematically, we are asking if...\n\nExposure + eye exercises > exposure\n\nWhat we find is a resounding **no**. EMDR is no better than traditional exposure treatments. If A + B = A, then B must = 0, yes? In this case, eye exercises = B, and exposure = A. The eye exercises are meaningless. Thus, if the eye exercises are not doing anything beyond exposure, why include them? If we know that it is the exposure that drives the therapeutic gains, why not focus on that? Why not allocate resources to bolstering those effects so they are more robust, potent, etc.? This is akin to a humorous analysis offered in the past, where doing exposure with a purple hat on and finding meaningful results means the purple hat must have done something. But, did it? Of course not. Most people would find that silly. Yet...that's *exactly* what EMDR is doing. Adding something useless and then suggesting it's a necessary piece.\n\nThen of course there's the question: well what harm comes from it? A few things:\n\n1) It takes focus away from the true mechanisms of treatment. This might delay empirical progress if people are diverted away from the treatment ingredients that are most useful.\n\n2) EMDR has made a lot of people rich despite, as previously pointed out, have delivered no additional efficacy. People pay thousands of dollars to participate in workshops for a therapy that has relied on, well, lying.\n\n3) There is a risk of watering down the treatment. Think of it like a game of telephone: the original word gets distorted by the end, right?

Therapist then support this emergence\n\n\u2022 Symbolic language of telling their own story, which reorders neural networks. Also de-emphasizes fear centers of the amygdala and changes how memory is stored \n\n\u2022 Fear has never been fully processed because of the trauma\n\n\u2022 Processing becomes easier, so does the recollection of the fear origin itself.\n\n\u2022 Individuals have shown to be more limber, stretching is better (indicating possible use with athletes in the future studies?)\n\n\u2022 Study on two family members at the same time will be in the next phase of trials, focusing primarily on one individual who is positive for PTSD while the other is not.

But in therapy, settings, there are no issues.\n\nFrom here I'll unpack some of the bullet points which are of particular interest, but basically what MDMA is doing is allowing the individual to process the trauma without triggering the fear and pain involved in that event. Not only that, because the fear is no longer an issue for the individual they are also able to **remember** the event even clearer, something about how the brain naturally tries to protect itself by rewiring the bad memory to something else, which explains why certain memories of childhood trauma are replaced with something else or they're forgotten altogether. \n\nThis is fascinating to me because it strongly indicates that MDMA is removing those defense mechanisms (or barriers) which is common with a lot of individuals with PTSD, thereby allowing them to confront the fear itself head on without the ego getting in the way, and they do this all by themselves most. All the therapists are doing is simply following the lead of the patient and letting the unconscious part of the patients mind to do the work for them. What's funny, one of the test subjects quit after the first session because he said he was cured and no longer needed another session, shocking the therapists. They still continued to follow up with him daily to make sure he was doing well, but so far he remains adamant that he's fine.

Aggression is more than just physical violence, and I think that the author is misleading people to start his article like this (to be fair, his article focusses on violence, but he talks about aggression more generally throughout). Big problems associated with violent media include other less obvious effects, such as [this](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/5/659) study by Greitemeyer and McLatchie (2011), which show that video games can cause people to dehumanize others, which then leads to aggression.\nFurthermore, the author only looks at physical violence as a strategy, and doesn't consider indirect aggression or hostile aggression (e.g. impulsive, emotional violence).\n\nAdditionally, the author only covers aggression as explained by frustration-aggression theory (Dollard et al., 1939?), but he doesn't respond to explanations involving Social Learning Theory (Bandura) or Script Theory (Huesmann). These types of theories argue that people learn behaviours and appropriate responses to situations through observation and imitation of other people, and that these behaviours are generalised to other situations. Bandura also talked about vicarious learning in his Social Learning theory, and video games appear to be possible stimuli for vicarious learning - players often see aggressive behaviour rewarded in video games, so they would learn that aggressive behaviour is appropriate.\n\nAlso, the author claims that people generally don't play violent video games for the violence. I'm not sure about this, because some games are clearly popular because of their violent content (e.g. one my favourite games, Killing Floor 2, which boasts game physics for dismembered body parts, among other things; or the classic, Mortal Kombat). It may be generally true that people don't buy games specifically for the violence, but you can't pretend that it isn't a factor, and you certainly shouldn't dismiss concerns based on this assumption.\n\nThe literature shows that there is a causal link between violent video games and aggression (see this meta-analysis by [Anderson et al., 2010](http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/a0018251)).

After gameplay, participants could blast a confederate with loud unpleasant noise through headphones (the aggression measure). Participants read ambiguous story stems about potential interpersonal conflicts, and listed what they thought the main characters would do or say, think, and feel as the story continued. As expected, aggressive behavior and hostile expectations increased over days for violent game players, but not for nonviolent video game players, and the increase in aggressive behavior was partially due to hostile expectations.\n\n**Study 2:** \n\nIntense acts of violence during video game play make daily life aggression appear innocuous: A new mechanism why violent video games increase aggression\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103113001595\n\nTLDR: two experiments reveal that playing a violent video game leads to a bias in the perception of what counts as aggressive, which in turn evokes aggressive behavior.\n\nTL, could read: People's beliefs as to how aggressive they are drops after playing violent games. A following study found that this affects their likelihood of administering hot sauce to people who allegedly are terrified of hot sauce.\n\n**Study 3:**\n\nViewing the world through \u201cblood-red tinted glasses\u201d: The hostile expectation bias mediates the link between violent video game exposure and aggression\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103112000029\n\nTLDR: French college students (N = 136) played either a violent or nonviolent game for 20 minutes. Afterwards, they read ambiguous story stems about potential interpersonal conflicts, and listed what they thought the main characters would do or say, think, and feel as the story continued. Aggression was measured using a competitive computer game in which the winner could blast the loser with loud noise through headphones. As hypothesized, video game violence increased the hostile expectation bias, which, in turn, increased aggression.\n\n**TLDR for all of this: the author of this article is straight up wrong, over relies on one narrative analysis (I hesitate to call it a meta-analysis because it only has 7 studies), claims that violence in games causing aggression is fully mediated by frustration (completely untrue, with no data to back that up), and ignores a bundle of research showing the fact is that it's actually violent games- regardless of difficulty- increase violence through hostile expectation (that is, if you do aggressive things, you tend to think others will be aggressive too)**\n\nPersonal view: I have an alternative explanation, but it is yet untested. Specifically, I think it's more nuanced than that- I think agency and hostile expectation work together to result in violent behaviour. That is, if you have no alternative but to be violent, it would temper the hostility considerably. "], [13, "Why are we still going over this?

From what I've read in the literature, video games and other minor things can influence aggression in people - the extent to which this translates into behaviour that one should worry about is a different matter.\n\nFor some other studies, look at these: [this](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0012-1649.39.2.201) which is a meta-analysis which finds a link between violent TV and aggresssion; [this](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.43.4.1038) which shows that participants become more aggressive due to violent video games if they can relate to the protagonist; and [this](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0025008) which shows that people are more aggressive when in the presence of a gun than when in the presence of a badminton racquet.\n\nAdditionally, I probably don't have much experience with critical analysis compared to many on this subreddit, but I think it makes more sense to go with the majority of the empirical evidence, rather than using a single study to say otherwise.

So players of first person shooters may be more agressive than players of puzzly games, but less agressive than soldiers or gang members.\n\nIn short, ignoring the difference between agression and violence means a lot of nuance gets lost.", "id": "d9417io"}, {"comment": "Which is a fine point to make if you have anything to back it up.

Look at the evolution of a game like Doom or Mortal Kombat and this is readily apparent. If there is some causal link between violent content and subsequent aggression (in whatever format you want to examine it) aggression should have been getting a lot worse over time, yet every trend concerning violence tends to run in the opposite direction\n\nAside from conflating violence and aggression (as another poster pointed out), this argument just doesn't hold up at all. If video games were the *only* things that affected real-world violence, then yes, violence should have increased alongside the spread of violent video games. But no one thinks that video games are the only cause of violence, so there are hundreds of reasons why one might increase and not the other. \n\nAs an analogy, think about the link between fast food and cardiovascular disease. Fast food consumption in the U.S. has generally increased over the past century, but the number of people dying from cardiovascular disease has been steadily decreasing since around the [60's](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/images/files/images/factbook/2012/37-Graph-4-7_2012.gif). Does that prove that fast food doesn't contribute to CVD, since one went up and the other went down? Well no, obviously it doesn't mean that. It means that there are other factors aside from fast food consumption that also contribute to CVD. By the same token, it's perfectly consistent to think that video games might contribute to aggression even if some measures of violence have decreased over the past few decades.", "id": "d94day8"}, {"comment": "So let's say conflating violence and aggression misses the mark entirely. It well might be the case. Maybe people are getting more aggressive in a way that does not increase violence.

Let's grant that is a possibility in either case.  \n\nHere's the question, then: what evidence exists that gamers have been getting more aggressive over time as violent content has been continuous improving and increasing?\n\n[Edit: Just to make it clear in the context of this post, we are talking about increases in aggression due to violent content *per se*, independent of the effects of things like competitiveness and difficulty] ", "id": "d94djcz"}], [{"comment": "[removed]", "id": "d937ngz"}], [{"comment": "I keep seeing this all the time, and it's always wrong. \n\nThe author make some good points regarding the complexity of the problem undertaken, but I strongly disagree with his assertions that\n\n1.

After gameplay, participants could blast a confederate with loud unpleasant noise through headphones (the aggression measure). Participants read ambiguous story stems about potential interpersonal conflicts, and listed what they thought the main characters would do or say, think, and feel as the story continued. As expected, aggressive behavior and hostile expectations increased over days for violent game players, but not for nonviolent video game players, and the increase in aggressive behavior was partially due to hostile expectations.\n\n**Study 2:** \n\nIntense acts of violence during video game play make daily life aggression appear innocuous: A new mechanism why violent video games increase aggression\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103113001595\n\nTLDR: two experiments reveal that playing a violent video game leads to a bias in the perception of what counts as aggressive, which in turn evokes aggressive behavior.\n\nTL, could read: People's beliefs as to how aggressive they are drops after playing violent games. A following study found that this affects their likelihood of administering hot sauce to people who allegedly are terrified of hot sauce.\n\n**Study 3:**\n\nViewing the world through \u201cblood-red tinted glasses\u201d: The hostile expectation bias mediates the link between violent video game exposure and aggression\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103112000029\n\nTLDR: French college students (N = 136) played either a violent or nonviolent game for 20 minutes. Afterwards, they read ambiguous story stems about potential interpersonal conflicts, and listed what they thought the main characters would do or say, think, and feel as the story continued. Aggression was measured using a competitive computer game in which the winner could blast the loser with loud noise through headphones. As hypothesized, video game violence increased the hostile expectation bias, which, in turn, increased aggression.\n\n**TLDR for all of this: the author of this article is straight up wrong, over relies on one narrative analysis (I hesitate to call it a meta-analysis because it only has 7 studies), claims that violence in games causing aggression is fully mediated by frustration (completely untrue, with no data to back that up), and ignores a bundle of research showing the fact is that it's actually violent games- regardless of difficulty- increase violence through hostile expectation (that is, if you do aggressive things, you tend to think others will be aggressive too)**\n\nPersonal view: I have an alternative explanation, but it is yet untested. Specifically, I think it's more nuanced than that- I think agency and hostile expectation work together to result in violent behaviour. That is, if you have no alternative but to be violent, it would temper the hostility considerably.

The point of my post was to say that the key mediating factor between violent media and aggression is actually the hostile expectation effect, not frustration as the author of this article (which heavily relies on no meta-analysis, but rather a arbitrary selection of studies)- hence why these studies are here.\n\nAs for your critiques, the reason why difficulty was not controlled for- in all three studies- was that previous research (in 2004) had already found that there was no effect of difficulty on it. \n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arlin_Benjamin_Jr/publication/237308783_Violent_video_games_Specific_effects_of_violent_content_on_aggressive_thoughts_and_behavior/links/02e7e53c2c24b691c0000000.pdf\n\nTo give you a quote from said article:\n> Ratings of game difficulty were affected by game [F(9, 120) \u00bc 7.86 ,P <001].The specific contrast comparing violent to nonviolent games was also significant and revealed the violent games to be more difficult (M \u00bc 3.60) than the nonviolent games (M \u00bc 2.80) [F(1, 120) \u00bc 8.67, P < .01, d \u00bc 0.52]. However, there was considerable variability within each game type and considerable overlap between the violent and nonviolent games. The violent game difficulty means ranged from 2.09 (Wolfenstein 3D) to 4.38 (Street Fighter). The nonviolent game difficulty means ranged from 1.54 (Ultra Pinball) to 4.83 (Myst) \n\nFurthermore, they found that difficulty, enjoyment, action, and frustration  had no significant effect. That is, no matter which way you slice it, the only thing that makes a big difference that is detectable is violence of the game.\n\nSo in this study, to give you a synopsis, they went on to find two games that did not significantly differ on difficulty, enjoyment, action, and frustration (Marathon 2 (violent) and Glider Pro (non-violent)), and used that in their further experiments. As predicted, hostile expectation mediated the link between violent video game playing and aggression (measured through noise blast). \n\nPersonally, I think the research should start moving toward another perspective- how can we reduce these effects, in game?

If a previous paper says that it was the case, that's why all three of these papers took this as a \"given\" and expected them accordingly.

Additionally, the evidence in this paper came out *after* the papers I put up above (I believe the papers I put there are 2014 or younger), so to critique them on that basis is weaker. You have a bunch of studies that replicate this effect, in contrast to one that doesn't- to me, I'll go with the larger (and my own opinion, better designed) evidence.\n\n> For the record, Glider Pro and Marathon 2 were, in fact, the first two games assessed in this paper.

It was not. I've since read through the paper in full, and I was wrong about the mediation. Good pick up, though.\n\nFurthermore, I'd also hazard a question that flies in the face of the research that was presented here: if frustration is key to the link between video game violence and aggression, why is it that violent TV programs also increase the likelihood of aggression? If frustration is key, then it doesn't make sense that violent media would also increase aggression. The link between media consumption->frustration->aggression does not apply to other forms of passive media, but the alternative model of violent media->hostile expectation->aggression would work in that context.

The study being cited by myself (Anderson) used Accessibility of aggressive thoughts scale.\n\nIn my tour through some papers today, this issue seems to crop up on both sides: the measure of aggression in this field appear largely unstandardized and not validated. I don't know precisely how much of this \"violent behavior\" they measure - like making people listen to loud music, eat hot sauce, or submerge their arm in ice water - really tracks much of anything beyond demand characteristics. Granted, this is a function of ethical considerations, but we need to real clear about what we mean when we talk about measuring aggression.\n\nRelatedly, it's entirely unclear to me ([and others](http://christopherjferguson.com/EP%20Review%20Part%201.pdf)) that measuring how \"accessible\" cognitive terms are is going to end up predicting pretty much anything of substance:\n\n\"While cognitions themselves are difficult, if not impossible to assess, there are superficial features of actual cognitions like semantic activation or accessibility of aggression-related concepts that are relatively easy to measure. However, the mere accessibility is not problematic, as it does not consequently result in any form of intent, let alone behavior. We would not reasonably conclude that having such associations leads one to intend to commit aggression or violent crimes or go to war any more than being primed with an image of whiskers would lead one to intend to be a cat. In fact, it would probably be evidence of neuropsychological impairment if a stimulus did not cause any associations with related constructs in a person.\"  \n\n>if frustration is key to the link between video game violence and aggression, why is it that violent TV programs also increase the likelihood of aggression?\n\nDo they? If measures of aggression here share similarities with measures of aggression from the video game research, I feel it's probably an equally-large mess. I don't think such effects are meaningful when it comes to predicting real-world outcomes.   \n\nI would certainly grant that, say, watching a scary movie can make one feel afraid of being eaten by zombies, just like watching Rambo can make one think it might be fun to go murder villages full of enemy combatants in the Jungle. By contrast, I don't think watching a scary movie would make people more afraid of dying from the flu nor do I think a violent one would make people think beating up puppies would make for good fun. \n\nMy intuition here is that aggression and fear relevant behaviors (as well as other domains) are generated by much more contextually-specific modules. A mechanism that just perceived a depiction of violence and made someone more aggressive across the board would not end up doing very adaptive things in the world.     \n\nAs a final note, this paper I covered is far from the only one which fails to find the effect of violence. I've actually been browsing some of the literature for most of today and the reports I'm seeing are quite mixed.

The first is that I think that behavioural measures of aggression (or at least, ones that measure actual in-vivo aggressive thoughts) are superior to paper based forms. More on that later. The second is ecological validity. That is, if you have 4 groups of games:\n\nViolent game + frustrating = aggression\n\nViolent game + not frustrating = no aggression\n\nNon-violent game + frustrating = no aggression\n\nNon violent game + not frustrating = no aggression\n\nAnd the vast majority of violent games out there are frustrating anyway, then you could potentially make the argument that because the vast majority of violent games are frustrating anyway, then violent video games in general, still cause aggression. \n\n> Relatedly, it's entirely unclear to me (and others) that measuring how \"accessible\" cognitive terms are is going to end up predicting pretty much anything of substance...\n\nIn regards to this perspective, sure, but we do the best we can with the most we have, not say there is no point and leave it at that. In this case, I believe- firstly- that violent behaviour as you mentioned above is not what we're looking at. Secondly, I would argue that aggression is better measured by ambiguous situations rather than paper based measures overall, due to the greater ecological validity. There's the idea that if say, someone cuts in front of you at Woolies, and you're given the chance for revenge in some form, that's more like a real life version of aggression than giving someone a form after someone cuts them off. \n\n> Do they? If measures of aggression here share similarities with measures of aggression from the video game research, I feel it's probably an equally-large mess. I don't think such effects are meaningful when it comes to predicting real-world outcomes.\n\nThere are so, so many studies on this. Like [the one on boxing matches\n](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2095544) increasing violence, ones that show adding television to one town increases assaults proporitionate to the rate that violent media was consumed, the Bobo Doll study (and the hundreds of follow ups), and various others (https://muse.jhu.edu/article/238862). In regards to horror films, funny enough, [those have been analysed too in a longitudinal pradigam.](http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1864-1105.20.3.79) \n\n> My intuition here is that aggression and fear relevant behaviors (as well as other domains) are generated by much more contextually-specific modules. A mechanism that just perceived a depiction of violence and made someone more aggressive across the board would not end up doing very adaptive things in the world.\n\nI would somewhat disagree on that. In this case, it's that viewing violent media- and participating it- causes the perceived acceptability of aggression as a means to an end. Extreme aggression as a problem solving mechanism, and seeing it *work*, results in modeling effects. If you were a \"blank slate child\" so to speak, and you saw someone take your candy, and you had seen a film previously where a guy punches another person for taking his food, then you would consider it to be \"okay\" to punch that other person. What violent media does is that it changes the context in which aggression and violence is an acceptable method of resolution, and therefore, an acceptable method of acting. As for the final part of that, aggressive across the board not being adaptive- pssh, we have a person running for president who is extremely aggressive. We live in a capitalistic society where competition and aggressive tactics are rewarded. To say that it isn't adaptive is just incorrect.\n\n> As a final note, this paper I covered is far from the only one which fails to find the effect of violence.

When the analysis was limited to experiments on physical violence against a person, the average r was still .32 (N=71 independent tests). This meta-analysis also examined cross-sectional and longitudinal field surveys published between 1957 and 1990. For these studies the authors found an average r of .19 (N=410 independent tests). When only studies were used for which the dependent measure was actual physical aggression against another person (N=200), the effect size remained unchanged. Finally, the average correlation of media violence exposure with engaging in criminal violence was .13.\n\nAnd for games:\n> Anderson and Bushman [19] conducted the key meta-analyses on the effects of violent video games. Their meta-analyses revealed effect sizes for violent video games ranging from .15 to .30. Specifically, playing violent video games was related to increases in aggressive behavior (r = .27), aggressive affect (r =.19), aggressive cognitions (i.e., aggressive thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes), (r =.27), and physiological arousal (r = .22) and was related to decreases in prosocial (helping) behavior (r = \u2212.27). Furthermore, when studies were coded for the** quality of their methodology, the best studies yielded larger effect sizes than the \u201cnot-best\u201d studies**.\n\nAnd as for the idea that it's not worth looking at, I would say that sends the wrong message. The costs are so high here- even if it is that low, and even if the proportion of variance explained by violent media on aggression or crime was even just 4%, it would be worth looking at because aggression- in all its forms- is extremely costly to society. \n\nFinally, I would like to add something else- I think a fundamental flaw with the study posted here would be the idea that the mediating factor is frustration- when to me, frustration is simply a proxy measure of anger. That is, people get angry because they get frustrated, and to remove that component meant of course there was less aggression- because they were less angry. \n\nSorry about the late reply, it's the end of October and the grant applications are all due in 3 days here!", "id": "d96g6vd"}, {"comment": "> Violent game + frustrating = aggression\n> Violent game + not frustrating = no aggression\n> Non-violent game + frustrating = no aggression\n> Non violent game + not frustrating = no aggression\n\nExcept the pattern of results uncovered consistently in the target article was (1) change in aggression, (2) no aggression, (3) aggression, and (4) no aggression. Tetris was not a violent game, yet frustration on it yielded changes in aggression measures when it was made more difficult or the controls made less intuitive. \n\n >In regards to this perspective, sure, but we do the best we can with the most we have, not say there is no point and leave it at that\n\nPerhaps, but then you need to be real clear about what you're measuring, what it does and does not predict, and what (if any) implications might be. If you say, \"we measured aggression,\" and your measure barely touches the construct in any meaningful way, you're misleading people. \n\nIf you're talking about r = .1 to .2 on some *unstandardizard, non-validated proxy measures* which might or might not even correlate with aggression in the world outside the lab without demand characteristics at all, let alone substantially, *and that's the best you can do when you're trying to find the effect* then I'm not going to be very impressed with the connection. \n\n>Like the one on boxing matches increasing violence\n\nI don't have access to the paper, but unless I'm misreading the abstract, it looks like it's making the exact opposite conclusion: \"This paper examines the logic of this research, arguing that it **does not** meet the special burdens of proof...we present detailed evidence suggesting that imitation effects attributed to mass media events(...) **are statistical artifacts**...\" \n\nSo what have I missed in the rest of the paper? \n\nSimilarly, the longitudinal one just presents the correlations, as far as I can tell from the abstract, which (again) doesn't impress me anymore than I suspect the reported correlation between violent video game sales and youth criminal violence (r = -.95) impresses you. \n\n>If you were a \"blank slate child\" so to speak, and you saw someone take your candy, and you had seen a film previously where a guy punches another person for taking his food, then you would consider it to be \"okay\" to punch that other person\n\nAnd the blank slate paradigm is completely incompatible with how the mind is known to work. \n\n>What violent media does is that it changes the context in which aggression and violence is an acceptable method of resolution, and therefore, an acceptable method of acting. \n\nThis sounds an awful lot to me like the \"porn causes rape\" argument, frankly, and we know how well that one has fared. \n\n>As for the final part of that, aggressive across the board not being adaptive- pssh, we have a person running for president who is extremely aggressive.

You have a lot of evolutionary theory to read up on. \n\n>Even if this is the case- don't you think that major bodies like the APA would have picked up on this?\n\nSince you mentioned that, here's another quote from that paper I linked last time: \n\n\"When drafting their policy statements, both the AAP and APA relied on a narrow group of scholars ideologically invested in the \u2018\u2018harm\u2019\u2019 view of media effects. These scholars then often refer back to these policy statements they themselves drafted as a kind of \u2018\u2018echo attribution\u2019\u2019 (Rosen & Davison, 2001) to imply an independent review of their work that, in fact, never occurred. The resulting policy statements are noncredible and present a glaring example of the breakdown of the scientific process.\"\n\nIf true, that would be a bit of an issue. \n\n>Finally, I would like to add something else- I think a fundamental flaw with the study posted here would be the idea that the mediating factor is frustration- when to me, frustration is simply a proxy measure of anger. That is, people get angry because they get frustrated, and to remove that component meant of course there was less aggression- because they were less angry.\n\nThe point is that *violent content per se was not predictive of aggression* and that such effects (the changes in aggression) were reduced as people had practice time with the game. In other words, not only was there no effect of violent content itself, but there was also indications that these (already small) effects go down over time, rather than build cumulatively. This interpretation seems to be consistent with longitudinal research consistently finding smaller effects than more short-term projects.     \n\n\n\n ", "id": "d96hsd7"}, {"comment": "> Violent game + frustrating = aggression Violent game + not frustrating = no aggression Non-violent game + frustrating = no aggression Non violent game + not frustrating = no aggression\n> Except the pattern of results uncovered consistently in the target article was (1) change in aggression, (2) no aggression, (3) aggression, and (4) no aggression. Tetris was not a violent game, yet frustration on it yielded changes in aggression measures when it was made more difficult or the controls made less intuitive.\n\nYou once again miss my point. I said IF, not this is what this core study represents. Additionally, the fact that this one paper (with poor design, I may add) found this, where the more consistent find is that the key mediating variable is actually hostile expectation, is a fair bit problematic. \n\n> Perhaps, but then you need to be real clear about what you're measuring, what it does and does not predict, and what (if any) implications might be. If you say, \"we measured aggression,\" and your measure barely touches the construct in any meaningful way, you're misleading people.\n> If you're talking about r = .1 to .2 on some unstandardizard, non-validated proxy measures which might or might not even correlate with aggression in the world outside the lab without demand characteristics at all, let alone substantially, and that's the best you can do when you're trying to find the effect then I'm not going to be very impressed with the connection.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"barely touches the construct in a meaningful way\"? Are you saying that a ecological measure upon which an individual is given the chance to either be more aggressive or not aggressive is less valid than a written test? Can we at least agree that a situation where you give the person the chance to be aggressive or not is more likely to be representative of a real world situation than a scale that they sit down and do? As for the idea that unstandardised-non validated measure, you're forgetting the longitudinal data, which clearly indicates that the consumption of violent media increase the likelihood of violence as it is (which I've brough up). Additionally, I'd like to see some data on that r=.1 or r=.2 on a meta-analysis, because I couldn't find said figure.\n\n> Like the one on boxing matches increasing violence\n> I don't have access to the paper, but unless I'm misreading the abstract, it looks like it's making the exact opposite conclusion: \"This paper examines the logic of this research, arguing that it does not meet the special burdens of proof...we present detailed evidence suggesting that imitation effects attributed to mass media events(...) are statistical artifacts...\"\n> So what have I missed in the rest of the paper?\n\nha, that's my fault for copy pasting. I was reading that critique in order to see whether to post it, and it's still worth it- here's the original: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2083426?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents. That's the right one- many apologies. Reading through the original and the critique linked, caution is warranted, but subsequent analyses still fit. There's a footnote in the original paper that talks about how micro level, longitudinal data is probably best, and the authors directly admit that ethnographic data and individual data would help clarify this. The increase in crime, they argue, is very small and likely to be obscured by stronger effects, but they also admit that violent media most likely has an effect. \n\n> Similarly, the longitudinal one just presents the correlations, as far as I can tell from the abstract, which (again) doesn't impress me anymore than I suspect the reported correlation between violent video game sales and youth criminal violence (r = -.95) impresses you.\n\nWait, what are you getting that -.95 correlation? There are a ton of other variables between violent games sales and youth criminal violence. And here's the full paper:\nhttp://ncys.ksu.edu.sa/sites/ncys.ksu.edu.sa/files/Violence%2067.pdf\nAnd if that doesn't impress you, let's talk about proportion of variance explained. Violent media exposure at time 1 explained 37.9% of the variance in violence beliefs, 47.3% of students\u2019 violence, and 46.5% of the delinquency. What do you have to say to that? \n\n> If you were a \"blank slate child\" so to speak, and you saw someone take your candy, and you had seen a film previously where a guy punches another person for taking his food, then you would consider it to be \"okay\" to punch that other person\n> And the blank slate paradigm is completely incompatible with how the mind is known to work.\n\nYeah, but that's again not the point. My point is that aggression is learned as a method of conflict resolution.\n\n> What violent media does is that it changes the context in which aggression and violence is an acceptable method of resolution, and therefore, an acceptable method of acting.\n> This sounds an awful lot to me like the \"porn causes rape\" argument, frankly, and we know how well that one has fared.\n\nThen how on earth do you explain the Bobo doll studies, and their variations? I'd also say that violent media causing aggression is a different kettle of fish than porn causing rape. A closer explanation would be that porn consumption would endorse unrealistic expectations of sex, which I'm sure there is evidence for.\n\n\n> If that's your response to the idea of violence being only strategically adaptive (coupled with the blank slate comment), then you have missed the boat to the point that I'm going to back out of this conversation, as you have so much homework to catch up. You have a lot of evolutionary theory to read up on.\n\n1. you're conflating violence with aggression, which is not the same thing. \n2 Evolutionary psychology, to me, is probably the weakest of all form of psychological research to the point our monthly psychology research school meetings pretty much constantly bring up evolutionary psych papers as the dingy standard in poor theoretical application. I even have a book called Alas, Poor Darwin, which levels some great critiques at the field. I've read a number of papers and it seems more overly reliant on heuristics, generalisations, forcing fits of models that don't actually apply, and so on. \n\nAbout that paper you're heralding as proof:\nhttp://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1027/1016-9040/a000164?journalCode=epp\nYou'll note that that paper has been heavily critiqued:\n> In this commentary, we first analyze Elson and Ferguson\u2019s (2013) attempt to offer a theory that would explain why exposure to family, community, school, and media violence could be related to increased aggression, but not cause such aggression. We conclude that the \u201cnew\u201d theory they offer is not very \u201cnew.\u201d It differs from dominant social learning theories only in its claim that the relation between exposure to violence and aggression is almost entirely due to people who are genetically or biologically predisposed to be aggressive also exposing themselves to more violence. We show this assertion is strongly contradicted by existing experimental and longitudinal data. We also show that Elson and Ferguson\u2019s so-called \u201cexhaustive review\u201d of empirical data on the topic is seriously flawed; that their claim that effect sizes are trivial is not supported by the math; and that their claim that scholars who believe that violent video games cause aggression are an \u201cextreme\u201d group in a divided field is contradicted by surveys that show the vast majority of researchers believe violent video games increase aggression. We point out that their claim that scholars who believe in media violence effects are having a \u201cmoral panic\u201d has no theoretical or empirical support, whereas the contrasting argument that researchers who produce violent media themselves, or use it extensively, are biased by the force of cognitive consistency and experience a \u201creactance\u201d of \u201cregulatory panic\u201d does have support from psychological theory.\n> \n\nYeah, that paper is motivated by something less than scientific. It doesn't fit the data at all. \n\n> The point is that violent content per se was not predictive of aggression and that such effects (the changes in aggression) were reduced as people had practice time with the game. In other words, not only was there no effect of violent content itself, but there was also indications that these (already small) effects go down over time, rather than build cumulatively. This interpretation seems to be consistent with longitudinal research consistently finding smaller effects than more short-term projects.\n\nAgain, what small effects are you talking about? I'd like to see your longitudinal analysis showing that violent media consumption has little to no effect on aggression- not violent behaviour, but aggression. I know you've said there's difficulties in assessment, but try to find one that you feel is acceptable. And of course long term effects would be smaller than short term ones- that's just a fact. Short term ones tend to be more sensitive, and aggression dissipates over time. However, considerable evidence suggests that acting out aggressively increases aggression [in the short term](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bbushman/PSPB02.pdf) and [long term](http://search.proquest.com/docview/1321939480?pq-origsite=gscholar).\n\nYou seem to have an agenda that is not built on science but rather personal feelings. I would hazard that you *want* it to a null effect rather than looking at the science and deciding it on the veracity of the evidence. For the record, I enjoy violent media too, and used to look at the research with disgust, but changed my mind after reading through it. Similarly, I loved steak, but after reading through the Harvard study, I stopped eating it. You have a choice to make- look through the data and admit that there is a significant, detectable effect, or to try to only look at evidence that fits your view. The choice is yours.

I'll try to break down the points you're making:\n\n1. You said \"Players of violent games\"- in this case, it's not players of violent games, it's a bunch of people who were made to play, and others who weren't. The difference here is they're not looking at correlation. That is, they're intentionally manipulating the variable of video game playing. Correlation would be more video game playing=more aggression, but to make the causative statement, you'd have to intentionally manipulate just one variable and see what happens- which they did above.\n\n2. Ambiguous measures- well, that was the point of my discussion. The author says that A. violent games tend to be hard-> B. when things are hard-> C. people get aggressive. The problem is, he has little to no (mathematical) proof of this. There would be a specific statistical test to do this. What I argued is that the evidence is suggesting that the middle bit is wrong. It's people play games-> which increases their expected hostility-> which then causes them to be more aggressive.\n\n3. Here's the thing about generalisability to overall aggressiveness. There are studies that have found that it [does link up](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/12/5/353.short) quite strongly- that is, these measures of aggression, when tested, directly link to aggressive and violent behaviours, being a great proxy measure.\n\n4. You wanted longitudinal studies: **[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18977956)** {~1500 people, 3-6 month follow up. Conclusion- exposure causes violence} [2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.20290/abstract) {300 people, 2.5 years. Conclusion-  high level exposure to violent games at first time point influenced physical aggression 2.5 years later}  \n\n5. That is true that there are a number of studies that show that there is no link- but they tend to be poorly done, funded by bodies that have an interest in the results, and they are swamped by the ones that do show an effect. The best kind of research to come to a conclusion is meta-analysis, and for that, see the APA's commentary on this: \nMyth 1. Violent video game research has yielded very mixed results. \nFacts: Some studies have yielded nonsignificant video game effects, just as some smoking studies failed to find a significant link to lung cancer. But when one combines all relevant empirical studies using meta-analytic techniques, five separate effects emerge with considerable consistency. Violent video games are significantly associated with: increased aggressive behavior, thoughts, and affect; increased physiological arousal; and decreased prosocial (helping) behavior. Average effect sizes for experimental studies (which help establish causality) and correlational studies (which allow examination of serious violent behavior) appear comparable (Anderson & Bushman, 2001).\nhttp://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2003/10/anderson.aspx\n\nTLDR: The research is pretty much shut on this.

It's just that it was worded (or more accurately wasn't as descriptive as it could have been) in a way to sensationalize it, as are most titles these days it seems. They were looking at the difference in the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses for children born in August (the youngest in their grade) and September (the oldest in their grade) and found a higher prevalence in children and adolescents born in August. \n\nThe part you quoted was in reference to the overall increase in ADHD diagnoses. Here is the what directly proceeds the excerpt you quoted: \n\n>In recent decades, the prevalence of children and adolescents being diagnosed with ADHD or receiving a prescription for ADHD has increased significantly worldwide, raising numerous clinical, scientific, and public health concerns and debate.\n\nWhat you quoted is not in contradiction with the purpose of the study. It is a possible explanation for the overall increase in diagnosis. The study is about a higher prevalence of diagnoses in children and adolescents who are younger than most of their classmates. \n\n**Study Design**\n>\nA total of 378\u2008881 subjects aged 4-17 years during the study period (September 1, 1997 to August 31, 2011) were enrolled in our study from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the likelihood of receiving ADHD diagnosis and treatment for those who were born in August (the youngest) compared with those who were born in September (the oldest).\n\n**Results**\n>Both boys and girls born in August had a higher risk of being diagnosed with ADHD (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.45-1.84; OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.36-2.15) and receiving ADHD medication (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.53-2.02; OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.26-2.18) than those born in September. Sensitivity tests conducted over different periods revealed consistent findings.\n\nThis led them to the conclusion that \n\n>Relative age, as an indicator of **neurocognitive maturity**, is crucial in the **risk of being diagnosed with ADHD** and receiving ADHD medication among children and adolescents. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering the age of a child within a grade when diagnosing ADHD and prescribing medication for treating ADHD.\n\nSo while a title of \"Relative age, as an indicator of neurocognitive maturity, is crucial in the risk of being diagnosed with ADHD and receiving ADHD medication among children and adolescents\" would have been more complete and insightful, \"ADHD children may just be immature, research suggests\" isn't an incorrect title. It is just lacking some clarifying information and as a result comes off as a bit disingenuous or misleading. You called it clickbait, which was no doubt the intention, but it wasn't inherently wrong. They simplified (probably oversimplified) neurocognitive maturity to maturity, and said that ADHD children may just be immature without specifying that this was in relation to those who are among the youngest in their grades diagnosed (perhaps misdiagnosed?) with ADHD. \n\nBad titles are problem (and the ADHD article certainly had a lacking title) but ultimately all of the information isn't going to be in the title. At some point it is up to the reader to find the context in the article or journal publication.

"], [25, "[removed]"], [24, "There seem to be some misconceptions about the study in question here and about morality in general, so it might help if a few issues are cleared up:\n\n1) the study does not claim that it's impossible to accurately view yourself as morally superior to somebody else. The study is looking at a well-known bias called the \"better-than-average effect\". Basically, it's the finding that on a number of measures (e.g. driving, maths, honesty, etc) people will report themselves to be better than average. This is a bias because it is impossible for the majority of people to be better than average, by definition. \n\nSo this bias only affects people's judgements *in relation to the average*. If an expert rally car driver with a clean driving history, no accidents, no errors, etc, were to claim that they were better than a learner driver who wrote off their car the only time they drove it, *then that's not a biased judgement*. They are literally a better driver. The study looks at moral judgements in relation to the average, but does not at all argue that one person cannot be morally superior to another.\n\n2) related to the first point, the study does not attempt to support moral relativism. It does not look at morality because morality is \"special\" by being \"subjective\". They simply chose it because past studies on the effect had touched on some moral traits.\n\n3) it is not at all uncontroversial to argue that \"morality is subjective\". It is in fact hugely controversial. Moral relativism is (bar one or two theorists) practically dead in ethics today, and the majority of ethicists are moral realists (you can read more [here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/) if you like).

There are facts about the world which shape our intuitions about maths - things being greater and lesser than, addition, subtraction, etc, and when we plug in all the variables it becomes objectively true that 2+2=4.

All you've shown is that moral standards change across cultures - everybody knows this, it's a fact of descriptive morality that all ethical systems accept. \n\nTo prove moral subjectivism or relativism though, you have to demonstrate that these moral views change because the moral facts are dependent on subjective states.

Firstly, appealing to authority is an excellent piece of evidence. It's not conclusive, of course, but if experts believe something to be true then it's great reason to think that thing is probably true. \n\nSecondly, while experts have been proven wrong in the past, it's important to keep in mind that this is almost never done by non-experts.

If you start with a simple definition like \"pleasant feelings are good and unpleasant feelings are bad,\" full-blown utilitarianism is a few short steps away.", "id": "d9zzxdc"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "da04rlf"}, {"comment": "First, I should clarify; by \"feelings,\" I mean something far more basic than \"I have a good feeling about this job\" or \"I have feelings for you.\" We're talking about pleasure, pain, satisfaction... That sort of thing, although the specifics will vary with the exact theory you're talking about.\n\n>But you're basing morality in human feelings and beliefs which is essentially human-centric subjective morality. That is to say, it's immoral to kill a human because a human will have bad feelings about dying. The same with \"humanity all holding one opinion\"; that's only taking humans into account.\n\nIf I mention \"all of humanity\" and such, it's only for convenience's sake. Depending on who you ask, this applies to all life, to a degree befitting their biological ability to experience different feelings.\n\n>What about other life? Is it immoral to crush a mouse? Does the mouse's feelings come into play in objective morality?\n\nYes, and so do the feelings of other conscious beings towards that mouse. In a utilitarian system, we must weigh (or create rules to approximate) many factors, including:\n\n-The pain, fear, and grief suffered by the mouse itself (we'll need at least some knowledge of mouse neurobiology to get a sense of this, and it also varies with the method of crushing)\n\n-The loss of any positive experiences that mouse might have had if it lived longer (again, we need to know how capable a mouse is of having positive experiences)\n\n-The attachment of other beings to the mouse (including its own kin, to the degree that such attachment is biologically possible,  but also including more conscious beings such as humans; this final point is what separates killing someone's puppy from slaughtering a pig of equal intelligence)\n\n>What if an advanced lifeform decided it was better for the Universe to rid it of humanity (and thus be objectively moral), do humans then have a say in who's feelings to take into account for morality?\n\nNo, but neither do the aliens. A utilitarian must take into account *everyone's* feelings. This means that the utilitarian answer to most scenarios like this is something like:\n\n\"If humans are *seriously* fucking up the universe for everyone else, and there is no way to resolve the situation without eliminating billions of sophisticated, conscious organisms, then the aliens are justified in taking action. If not, then the aliens are in the wrong.\"\n\nNow, this might lead you to ask: what if they underestimate our ability to feel and/or they overestimate our negative impact on the universe? That's what leads to things like the holocaust, after all.\n\nThe utilitarian will respond that you can very easily be *wrong* about what is moral, which is why genocide shouldn't ever be the answer, no matter how sure you may be.\n\nThis line of thinking is the beginnings of \"rule utilitarianism,\" which says that we should come up with rules of thumb which, when followed, generally lead us to maximize good feelings (AKA utility). This stands opposed to \"act utilitarianism,\" which says that we must make a utility calculation every time in order to act morally.\n\nIf rule utilitarianism sounds familiar, that's probably because our concept of \"laws\" is an example of it. Laws are societal rules designed to maximize utility for members of that society (or, at their worst, those who made the laws).\n\nOne strength of utilitarianism is that most other moral or legal systems can be boiled down to it in a similar way. This includes systems that *claim* to be very different, such as religious ones; no matter how a Catholic might say that God decides what is moral and what is immoral, heaven and hell exist for a reason. The ultimate determining factor is seeking good feeling while avoiding bad feeling.\n\nI don't expect one comment to convince you to change your worldview. I used to think (as little as a couple years ago) that moral relativism was the end-all of ethics, so I'm **very** sympathetic to your perspective. I didn't understand why most ethicists abandoned it; how can we say that a universal morality exists without assuming the existence of God or some other kind of magical code floating out in space?\n\nThen I realized (not on my own, and not quickly) that that may be the wrong way to look at it. \"Morality\" is an English word for an abstract concept. What that concept *means* can be universal, in the same way that the existence of math is universal even though we invented this thing called \"numbers\" and gave them names.\n\nThus, \"2+2=4\" is a universally true statement (not a subjective one), even though the actual operators we're using to describe the relationship are subjective. Similarly, you may find that it is at least *possible* that \"maximizing good feelings is morally good\" is a universally true statement.", "id": "da06y8r"}, {"comment": ">I guess the trouble I'm having in this discussion is that you're just telling me \"experts think this, and what you're saying isn't a serious theory\", but there has not been any facts or actual substance in your argument; just empty claims.\n\nErr... that's because moral arguments tend to be book length. I could try to replicate them in the form of paragraphs, but they would not look very impressive at that size. Pointing out what the experts think **is** what you should start with for any subject. Because while they can in theory be wrong, the consensus of them is something that can't be ignored, and shows you what they think about things, including any other arguments that might be presented. To a non expert they might not know what qualifies as a good case for any given field, not being in it, so explaining what those who are think at least establishes the standard that other things are seen in relation to. \n\nAlso I didn't make an argument. So I'm not sure what you are referring to. I told you a short one line description of three different theories for potential things that answered your question. You asked \"Who is out there to determine an absolute Right and Wrong if not the subjective mortals of each society?\" But the question itself is wrong, since it should be \"what\" not who, since the word who presumes an answer to the very thing its asking. When other answers are available.\n\n>Could you at least give me one example of a real world moral that is rigidly objective?\n\nThat's not how it works. Objective morality doesn't refer to existing human precepts. It simply states that there's a fact of the matter about morality. Close to no ethicists think they know the actual answer with definite proven certainty. They just agree that there is one, and that work can be done to if not find the absolute answer, at least make a little progress on it. This is two different fields. Metaethics is about the nature of what morality is in general and its scope, and normative ethics is where distinct facts would come in. \n\nThe reason people confuse this is because in english there's only one word that is used for the distinct concepts of \"human lists of precepts\" and \"fact of normative interpersonal value relations.\" This is partially the fault of christianity. Christians used divine command theory as a way to blur the idea of the facts with the idea of what is in human minds. Because if it is a command the command can be both something someone heard as well as where the fact comes from. But that's one assumption that comes from an outdated theistic idea that's not part of modern ethical study anymore.\n\nIf you really want though I could give a few short explanations of what some of the arguments that exist are, or links to a few articles (though I don't know all of the relevant ones, only a few) or books to read.", "id": "d9zzudc"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "da056c7"}, {"comment": "I didn't say that.

Just that the language used in saying that there needs to be a \"higher power\" implies something uber mystical that is not necessary for morality to exist. And that assumptions that morality can only be explained using mysticism are way out of date. One of the most popular theories in modern metaethics is just moral naturalism that totally naturalizes it into tangible value relations in the real world. So the only higher power that would need to exist if moral naturalism was true is enough entities capable of experiencing that interpersonal value relations can even exist.\n\nIf you want to know about why morality is seen as real, fully getting a big picture would take reading quite a few books. It won't look impressive just stated in two paragraphs by someone online. But a few important pointers is that once you de anthropomorphize your idea of what morality is supposed to be, this erases the view that it is meant to look like a set of commands, and replaces it with an idea of normative interpersonal relations of value having an objective state. That doesn't prove they exist, but once people realize what it even is that people are trying to talk about it becomes a lot less mystical seeming and more mundane than what people were previously thinking when their idea of objective morality meant something more or less like divine command theory. (Which isn't even really objective).\n\n>The \"needs\" of survival are only valid in the sense that we want to survive. How do you know that survival itself is morally good? The universe gets along just fine without life. \n\nIt helps to not start by asking about morality. Instead of asking about something that complicated, we can instead ask about just value theory first. Namely what intrinsic value exists. Its surprisingly hard to coherently doubt the existence of intrinsic value, since in practice nobody does for real, since people think that certain experiences are actually better than others (saying that its based on personal preference doesn't mean intrinsic value doesn't exist). So if we establish that for individuals certain things are good in general, we already have the building blocks of morality. That alone doesn't **prove** morality exists of course. But suddenly the idea of good exists, and has to be taken seriously. The question is how to go from value existing to interpersonal value relations having normativity? That is a bit harder. And to do convincingly takes book length.\n\nFortunately, we can also prove normativity exists. The short version is that we know that some facts about the world can make certain beliefs logically correct. If they corresponds with the facts obviously. So the idea of normativity is not bizarre. Obviously even these two facts taken alone when combined does not prove morality even in this way. But we are starting to get a bigger picture. Morality is normativity of interpersonal value relations. Both those things exist separately, so the issue is whether they can go together, and what kind of weight it has if they do.\n\nI could go on. But the point is that we already showed that the building blocks of morality that would need to exist do exist. So people who assume its weird or spooky or incomprehensible are already starting on the wrong foot. Thus undermining their reasons for thinking that you should default to being against it and flipping that around. There's more work that would be ahead, but you get the idea.

The study is looking at a well-known bias called the \"better-than-average effect\". Basically, it's the finding that on a number of measures (e.g. driving, maths, honesty, etc) people will report themselves to be better than average. This is a bias because it is impossible for the majority of people to be better than average, by definition. \n\nSo this bias only affects people's judgements *in relation to the average*. If an expert rally car driver with a clean driving history, no accidents, no errors, etc, were to claim that they were better than a learner driver who wrote off their car the only time they drove it, *then that's not a biased judgement*. They are literally a better driver. The study looks at moral judgements in relation to the average, but does not at all argue that one person cannot be morally superior to another.\n\n2) related to the first point, the study does not attempt to support moral relativism. It does not look at morality because morality is \"special\" by being \"subjective\". They simply chose it because past studies on the effect had touched on some moral traits.\n\n3) it is not at all uncontroversial to argue that \"morality is subjective\". It is in fact hugely controversial. Moral relativism is (bar one or two theorists) practically dead in ethics today, and the majority of ethicists are moral realists (you can read more [here](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/) if you like). For the theorists who aren't moral realists, they still reject moral relativism so the claim of subjective morals is questionable at best.\n\nSo for all our new users visiting the sub today, it's okay if you want to disagree with some aspect of the scientific study but you need to present some evidence or argument to support your position.

And as one uses one form of cognition or the other, it becomes more reinforced and more likely to be employed in the future. Also, if one experiences a deficiency in one form, the person may be more likely to employ the other. The result would be that people deficient in the ability to perceive the physical world will tend to employ explanations that employ social cognition (such as attributing minds to entities), and vice versa. Also, as people feel satisfied with a certain set of explanations as they live their life, this may result in a neglect of the other form of cognition, thus rendering it more impoverished through neglect (but not due to neural defect). One way to beging to test would be to test the reverse: are people with poor understanding of the social world more likely to be scientific or analytical beliefs, or have superstitious beliefs that do not perceive minded entities (not things such as ghosts, witches, and demons which are seen as having minds)?\n\nIf that hypothesis is correct, then the study is more correlational than suggesting a direct relationship between understanding the physical world and religious/paranormal beliefs (outside of instances where the neural architecture used in object cognition is defective itself). Instead, the poor object cognition is simply an effect of the primary cause, a frequently used social cognition.

You have four worlds, the top one of which is the realm of pure forms in which essential, abstract ideas exist. In Kabbalah, and to Plato, this world *really exists* in some sense.\n\nWhat's the significance of that? Well, if you think that you're just working in the physical world, then you can say \"well my consciousness works this way, but maybe somebody else's has emerged from material reality differently\".\n\nWhereas to a Kabbalist, there are *absolute* ways in which consciousness operates, because the relationships between the source of consciousness and material reality are explicitly defined.\n\nTo a person who believes thusly, spirituality is an objective science; not one which is more symbolic than literal at all. Yes it's about using symbols, but the belief is that there is an objectively correct symbol system.

Kabbalah is very much intrinsically rooted in the Hebrew language, and the teaching is definitely that the specific forms of the letters objectively match the abstract concepts which they correspond to.\n\nThat said, it is totally possible to use the concepts without any knowledge of the letters, and everyone speaking every language around the world does so every day.\n\nSo you talk about mystical traditions being about learning to utilize our minds better - to a kabbalist meditating on the concepts behind the letters in one way or another is the way to do this.\n\nThe idea is that thought is a series of concrete concepts, which, when combined/permuted and existing in context have meaning. When each concept is sharp in your mind, your thoughts move rapidly, rather than being muddled.\n\nAn analogy (and obviously the insinuation is that there's some literal truth here) is that a mind is like a quantum particle in superposition - there are a variety of states that it can be in, and it objectively collapses into one state, then another, then another. The time in between where it is in superposition is lost time.\n\nSo to go back to the orange/sphere/square analogy, both people can think sphere, but one might think of it less quickly/clearly, literally because the symbols and sounds of the letters s, p, h, e, r, and e don't match with the *idea* as well as the Hebrew word \"dur\", (dalet vav resh) does.\n\n**So**, that's the idea, I'll leave it up to you to decide whether you can think of a sphere more clearly when you say \"dur\" to yourself or when you say \"sphere\".\n\nI personally am unsure.

Symbols so complex that they are often misunderstood. Putting this ordeal in terms of science, it's like someone reading a 30 page meta-analysis paper, not really quite getting it, then using that paper as an important citation within their own. Then, the people in charge of reviewing the paper, as it's their PhD dissertation, because they don't quit get it either given it's complexity, but don't wish to lose their shot at tenure by shooting down such a verbose and beautiful theory, give their stamp of approval. Then the guys running the journal they send it off to, inundated by the constant flux of papers, try to get it, but don't really and assume it's because they're just not smart enough to. They put their stamp on it and, poof, published. Now a whole bunch of people buy it, cause it's mostly good though not completely, and the people who disagree with it are told to fuck off. Similar issues happen with religious systems, but on an arguably larger scale. Ain't no scientific review (for the most part) and too much a push on the whole guru system. However, the Rosicrucians seem to be on the rise. Count me one of their number.\n\nOf course, in the midst of all of this, people want to Know. And this need is growing because of the degradation of our environment, political systems and economic systems. We know we need a solution and soon. And so more shit is published in fear, more half answers are produced, and more hopelessness (learned helplessness) pervades. On top of that, it gets worse. People start to get really angry that they can't seem to find some sort of solution, so they decide to take advantage of the shit they figured out for personal gain. In religious systems, this happens with false gurus and false messiahs.  In science, it takes the form of pseudoscientists or, even, scientists that appear to be real scientist but are just pseudoscientists. Good example of this, one which will get this down-voted further, is Neil deGrasse Tyson. Guy is a megalomaniac. \n\nAnyway, what they, both scientists (\"pseudoscientists\") and false gurus are taking advantage of (usually unconsciously/automatically or, sometimes, consciously) is the fact that a well constructed \"Why\" gives people influential power over other people.  What most people miss is that the reason that occurs is due to the nature of \"Why\". For, as would be argued in the higher religious sciences, once you \"get it\", that's called Enlightenment. However, there are lower realizations which allow you to understand this fact without enlightenment. This is called \"Liberation\". i.e. \"Why\" is the True \"Last Question\". Thus, at least from that perspective, of course \"why\" would hold the most power to influence our perspectives.\n\nGenerally, I'm being dismissed because it's a really uncomfortable truth for a very large number of people, scientific and religious alike.

And as one uses one form of cognition or the other, it becomes more reinforced and more likely to be employed in the future. Also, if one experiences a deficiency in one form, the person may be more likely to employ the other. The result would be that people deficient in the ability to perceive the physical world will tend to employ explanations that employ social cognition (such as attributing minds to entities), and vice versa. Also, as people feel satisfied with a certain set of explanations as they live their life, this may result in a neglect of the other form of cognition, thus rendering it more impoverished through neglect (but not due to neural defect). One way to beging to test would be to test the reverse: are people with poor understanding of the social world more likely to be scientific or analytical beliefs, or have superstitious beliefs that do not perceive minded entities (not things such as ghosts, witches, and demons which are seen as having minds)?\n\nIf that hypothesis is correct, then the study is more correlational than suggesting a direct relationship between understanding the physical world and religious/paranormal beliefs (outside of instances where the neural architecture used in object cognition is defective itself). Instead, the poor object cognition is simply an effect of the primary cause, a frequently used social cognition.

I am not talking about idle questions. I am talking about questions like \"how do we stop destroying ourselves\", \"why the fuck do I go on living\", \"what do I tell my child to genuinely ease the terror she is feeling\"... those are questions science can't answer. My point isn't that other systems succeed-- but they are actually *asking the question*. And that is the whole point-- western civilization, in essence QUIT trying to answer those questions. And as a collective culture, a sort of malaise set in. It is very hard to put that into perspective unless you actually put yourself in the mindset of other historical periods.\n\nNow you may ask why I pose theism as a counter, since there are other systems of thought that try to answer the bigger questions... On one level philosophy certainly does... And that's fine, if you find those beliefs satisfactory. My point isn't that theism is needed per se, but that the hard questions have to be addressed in some serious way, which they are not.

Small sample size is not great, it reduces the generalizability of the results, inherently has far less diversity within the sample, and is often used because statistically significant results are much easier to come by with a smaller sample size.\n\n2. Correlation does not equal causation. As some of you have said, there are other variables that might have a relationship to the findings that are unaccounted for.\n\nAnother interesting note is that consistent marijuana use during adolescence can cause behaviors that mimic the clinical presentation of schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). One of the neuroanatomical findings in spd is reduced volume of the striatum and striatal structures the caudate and putamen. The putamen is rich in D2 receptors and has a direct link to the prefrontal cortex. With the reduction of volume and also reduced functionality because the pfc is not being activated, it can be suggested that Marijuana use will then make one more impulsive, less attententive (which results in poorer working, or short-term memory), reduced critical thinking, poor executive functioning, and more. \n\nThe brain can adapt though, as in SPD, the brain has the ability to form new networks of neural activity and activate compensatory brain structures (normally ventral regions) to mitigate the effects caused by the reduced volume and dopamine release. \n\nWhat should you take away from this study? Yes, smoking weed makes you more impulsive and less attentive, that's why you can't stop eating and say 'huh?' When someone asks you a question.

Maybe MMJ helps reestablish a more healthy ratio of levels of all our transmitters?  How would we ever know the truth when the place we start the measure (benchmark/control) is already ambiguous?\n\nIs the culture you live in normal where you think the majority of humans in the culture are mentally stable or is your culture abnormal/psychotic (this is in your humble opinion)?  So after that question how do we answer what a NORMAL level of dopamine is for all humans?  Science is great and a fantastically useful tool, but it is not the end all due to these questions I bring up.  What is normal?  What is a normal level of any chemical in our bodies.  Why do humans continually look to change there consciousness with mind altering substances (alcohol, sugar, caffeine, nicotine, acid, MMJ, MDMA, cocain...).  Diversity of experience/perception of reality is why I alter my consciousness.  If the world today does challenge you to find a new way of life...I don't know what to say.\n  \nWhat the !@!@ is normal or the correct level of a neurotransmitter?  How the hell can these scientist make the conclusions they do?  How do they KNOW the benchmark, the control is what they say it is?  Humans are a moving target how the hell are we so confident we have a non-moving benchmark/control?\n  \nSorry...I rant\n\nmake a great day...", "id": "d246p4s"}, {"comment": "The authors answer these concerns about normal levels with a control group.", "id": "d24fegd"}, {"comment": "I may not have explained my idea very well.  How do they know what a normal/typical level of dopamine should be?  If most humans have been exposed to PTSD, ether by war, great trauma or your Dad came back from war and exposed you to it.  What is a normal level of dopamine...a statistical average.  \n  \nThis is my point.  How do we know that being less or more than this statistical number is good or bad.  How many people where tested to create this average level.  Science screams ACCURACY!  And yet we rely on statistics of dopamine levels dating back...how many years.  What where the dopamine levels in humans 200 years ago?  What where the dopamine levels of the average British subject during the bombings of London?  So many variables.  We are talking brain chemistry.  How much dopamine do we need to have a change in mental/emotional states?  These numbers are crude because all you can do is give it to another and wait for them to tell you they feel/think differently.  \n  \nWe know less about neurotransmitters than we would like to admit.  We as scientist only recently (1950's) discovered a whole new system in our bodies, ECS endocannabinoid system.  This system interacts with every other neurotransmitter system and every other SYSTEM in our bodies.  Only 60+ years of knowing this system and we still don't study MMJ to the extent we need to and we think we understand what dopamine does and how much you should have flowing in your brain to be normal/typical.  The latest debate about serotonin is they think the original understanding of its function may be off by quite a bit.  So, all those SSRI's out there might be doing things to our brains we don't understand because we...scientist jumped of the edge of knowledge to fast.  If the roll of serotonin is not what we originally thought than what are all these SSRI's doing?  The jury is still out on this one.  Stay attuned.\n\nSo, the statistics of today are based in modern day living.  Modern day...is this normal to you?  Do you think because you see black asphalt to all over the place that it is normal?  What about buying the latest version of a phone every year or so and what...you think this is normal?  A new phone that does nothing necessary beyond and above the last version of the same phone.  This is insanity.  This is a culture that has been over marketed, over manipulated.  Modern living is not normal and the levels of dopamine on average may be a little higher or lower depending on the social climate and the stress any one of us is going through on the day they measured my dopamine levels.  \n\nUnder my premise the control group is not so controlled.  You replaced my word \"benchmark\" for \"control and I assume you used it because that is the word the scientists use.  \n  \nFunny thing is I worked as a research chemist in the pharmaceutical industry for 25+ years.  I don't buy the paradigm they are pushing.  Science is great, but science full of hubris is lame and science based in making money off of $100 pills is fraudulent.  What I did was not research.  I made as many compounds as humanly possible for screening in high through put biological assays.  This is not science this is industrialized compound making and testing.  The compiling of the data and the next bit of testing is rigorously controlled by a few people at the top.  They choose not to do some studies because they don't want to take the risk the answer will hurt their chances of..........NDA, NEW DRUG ADMINISTRATION...yippee another pill for the medical industry (wow that is an interesting phrase, \"medical industry\") to make billions off the American public.  And then charge less around the world.  When was the last cure?  When was the last great success of the pharmaceutical industry?  What about that war on Cancer?  And now they found MMJ helps apoptosis-natural death of cancer cells...no medical use or indication...schedule 1 for you my little plant.  \n  \nScience is not pure it is mixed heavily with money and politics.  Get them to take a pill for 3-6 months telling them that they may not get the good effects of this new SSRI unless you take it for weeks to months.  Than if it does not work we have 35 other pills we can try to find the one for you.  Say you needed to go through four pills before you find the good one for you.  How much money was paid to the companies that made the pills you didn't like?  This is not even getting them addicted to your pill.  This is...an authority, your doctor telling you to spend your insurance money (if you have insurance), $100's of insurance money on 3-6 months of pills four times over.  Great way to make money on a product you don't even know is going to work.  \n  \nSorry, I rant again.  My idea about the benchmark/control is thin.  I think it is a fine line, yet a good idea to keep in mind.  \n  \nI quote Einstein, \"I do not believe that a moral philosophy can ever be founded on a scientific basis. \u2026 The valuation of life and all its nobler expressions can only come out of the soul\u2019s yearning toward its own destiny.

I have done a decent amount of research and taken numerous classes on research design and statistics. I did not read this exact article, but here are a few points that ARE NOT MISCONCEPTIONS and in fact represent issues within scientific research.\n\n1. Small sample size is not great, it reduces the generalizability of the results, inherently has far less diversity within the sample, and is often used because statistically significant results are much easier to come by with a smaller sample size.\n\n2. Correlation does not equal causation. As some of you have said, there are other variables that might have a relationship to the findings that are unaccounted for.\n\nAnother interesting note is that consistent marijuana use during adolescence can cause behaviors that mimic the clinical presentation of schizotypal personality disorder (SPD). One of the neuroanatomical findings in spd is reduced volume of the striatum and striatal structures the caudate and putamen. The putamen is rich in D2 receptors and has a direct link to the prefrontal cortex. With the reduction of volume and also reduced functionality because the pfc is not being activated, it can be suggested that Marijuana use will then make one more impulsive, less attententive (which results in poorer working, or short-term memory), reduced critical thinking, poor executive functioning, and more. \n\nThe brain can adapt though, as in SPD, the brain has the ability to form new networks of neural activity and activate compensatory brain structures (normally ventral regions) to mitigate the effects caused by the reduced volume and dopamine release. \n\nWhat should you take away from this study? Yes, smoking weed makes you more impulsive and less attentive, that's why you can't stop eating and say 'huh?' When someone asks you a question. That part is fairly obvious, does the 'damage' last forever?

I overthink a lot. This is a problem if you rehash the same problem over and over and repeat the same bad thought over and over again. At all times I'm trying to find the source of my unhappiness. Being *aware* that you are unhappy and need to find the source is really the first step. That doesn't come by itself. Sometimes I go for a walk in the park and focus completely on *why* I feel bad. There's two basic questions that go first: Have I had enough sleep? Have I had enough to eat? About 90% of the time I feel unhappy lack of sleep or food is one of the causes. Most of the time there's also another source of unhappiness, but generally if you've slept or eaten enough you wouldn't feel so bad. So that's a first.\n\nIf that's out of the way, you can look at the other sources. Often something happened where I felt excluded or turned down by some friends. Or if someone mentioned something casually that struck me. Often I only realise these things after I walk through a park. Knowing these sources of my unhappiness allow me to relativate, accept or possibly solve them. I'm quite easy to relativate and accept stuff. It's not always a good trait, but it keeps me happy.\n\nFurthermore, if I take a step back and look at who I am and what I've achieved I instantly feel somewhat happy. I consider myself kind, intelligent and open-minded. When something emotional happens I always ask *why?* Why did I feel/do this? Why did he/she do/feel this? After many years of overthinking and overanalysing that question, I know my emotions and know how to deal with them, but also know why people behave a certain way, which allows me to understand and forgive them. I never feel hatred and very rarely get angry. I feel mentally incredibly stable. These are things I cannot teach. Or rather, they can be taught, but only after many years of hard work and dedication. Somehow I got lucky that I got a right mix of nature and nurture. I'm not perfect either and I have my flaws, but I know them and how to deal with it.\n\n1) Music\n\n2) Dare to be vulnerable.

Let's for example talk about fear, by resisting fear you are not expressing fear. 90% of the time this fear is created by thought and it's your bodies reaction to thought of fear. There is actually nothing to fear , like an animal would fear for his life in the wild. Instead thought creates an idea of fear and body thinks there is a life threatening situation so it pumps up chemicals as a reaction to this emotion.

People cling to emotions life fear, anger or embarrassment, and the same thought keeps playing in their head over and over. This drains a great deal energy from people. Not resisting is not easy, going deep into emotions, just feeling them completely, without resisting it you will soon realize that the emotion fades away.

The fundamental dialectic of DBT is being able to accept yourself as you are (which is ACT-ish), while simultaneously working to change yourself for the better (more traditionally CBT territory). It does this through teaching specific skills in four overarching domains: Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, Interpersonal Effectiveness and Emotion Regulation. \n\nI'm relatively new to DBT, but my clients love it.

Say, you catch your wife cheating, it's probably sadness you are feeling, but it'd be easy to skip feeling that and jump to rage.

There are criticisms of the position and Firestone is one of the main researchers presenting such criticisms, but we can't deny that it's a phenomenon with a fair amount of acceptance. To make it clearer, I agree with Firestone's descriptions of:\n\n>There is a growing consensus that such effects are ubiquitous, and that the distinction between\nperception and cognition may itself be unsustainable. \n\n#\n\n>While such factors are largely absent from contemporary vision science in practice, the\nemergence of so many empirical papers reporting top-down effects of cognition on perception\nhas shifted the broader consensus in cognitive science. Indeed, such alleged top-down effects\nhave led several authors to declare that the revolution in our understanding of perception has\nalready occurred, proclaiming as dead not only a \u201cmodular\u201d perspective on vision but often the\nvery distinction between perception and cognition itself.  For example, it has been asserted that\nit is a \u201cgenerally accepted concept that people tend to see what they want to see\u201d (Radel &\nCl\u00e9ment-Guillotin, 2012, p.233), and that \u201cthe postulation of the existence of visual processes\nbeing functionally encapsulated \u2026 cannot be justified anymore\u201d (Vetter & Newen, 2014, p.73).\nIn an especially sweeping claim, this sort of evidence led one philosopher to declare that \u201c[a]ll\nthis makes the lines between perception and cognition fuzzy, perhaps even vanishing\u201d and to\ndeny that there is \u201cany real distinction between perception and belief\u201d (Clark, 2013, p.190).\n\n#\n\n>Against this wealth of evidence and its associated consensus, the thesis of this paper is\nthat there is in fact no evidence for such top-down effects of cognition on visual perception, in\nevery sense these claims intend. With hundreds of reported top-down effects, this is,\nadmittedly, an ambitious claim.\n\nSo I'm certainly not arguing that it's perfect or without criticism, but rather I'm responding to the claim that it can't be true given that there have been no radical shifts in neuroscience.\n\n>Perception is not the same thing as judgement. Perception does not change due to factors such as distance, weight and motivation. However, judgement can.\n\nI don't think Firestone's \"perception vs judgement\" is the right way to frame the criticism you (and he) are pushing for. The entire point of this embodied cognition approach is that the distinction between perception and cognition is not as concrete as we thought, and that judgements are a part of the perceptual process. \n\nI think it's more accurate to suggest that there is a difference between perception and postperceptual processes, in that it's okay for us to include judgements of distances as a measure of perception (since if cognition influences perception this is a necessary component) but it's not okay if those judgements are the result of non-perceptual processes (e.g. after-the-fact rationalisations or thoughts etc). \n\nWitt, Proffitt, and Epstein have a good response to this criticism [here](http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/perlab/pdf/Witt_whenhowscaled.pdf), where they empirically test the claim and argue that research can be improved to take it into account but ultimately the theory is still supported. \n\n>I strongly advice you to read Firestone and Scholl's earlier mentioned paper on this. They discuss it very clearly.\n\nThanks but I've already read it, and the earlier debates between Firestone and Proffitt from 2013. I recommend reading Andrew Wilson's take on the whole debate [here](http://psychsciencenotes.blogspot.com/2013/11/what-are-units-that-perception-measures.html) as it's extremely fair and identifies pros and cons to each side of the argument.\n\n>Just to give a preview, I cite: \"If what we think, desire, or intend (etc.) can affect what we see in these ways, then a genuine revolution in our understanding of perception is in order.

If you meant more like vision science in general, then yeah it's a challenge to the modular view that Firestone describes but I'm not sure it'd affect the neuroscience specifically.

There's no convincing empirical evidence for top-down effects of cognition on visual perception.  They're not even actively defending the idea that cognition doesn't affect visual perception, just that it hasn't actually been demonstrated.\n\nIn their reply to the BBS commentaries, Firestone and Scholl more or less dismiss the neuroscience commentaries as empty and unfalsfiable.

But to teach creativity and lateral thinking, that is a hard task. \n\n> When we reward effort more than effect we risk promoting the mediocre ahead of the ingenious. This happens a lot in academia.\n\nNo, this just isn't true, this is just a function of risk analysis, you promote the low risk option because it is more likely to succeed and gain positive results, those results are also very likely to be less profound than a high risk strategy that will often fail but will also have true novel insight into a problem. At many levels of academia, true novel insight isn't going to occur because the students aren't knowledgeable enough to make the connections and the subject is too in depth to realistically teach them so they could achieve it.

", "id": "cz1kja5"}, {"comment": ">At many levels of academia, true novel insight isn't going to occur because the students aren't knowledgeable enough to make the connections and the subject is too in depth to realistically teach them so they could achieve it.\n\nI'm going to level with you:  This is just blind arrogant wank and in fact a *perfect* mirror for the video clip.\n\nYou're criticizing the student for failing to \"Climb the flagpole\" by participating in:\n\n>a game of jumping through hoops\n\nThis gnostic argument might have applied in high schools, and possibly in early years of the education system but I'll make two points against it.\n\nFirstly, if low risk is a function of the education system it promotes the mindset and the individuals who possess the mindset of low risk game playing.  And as a gamer let me be absolutely clear, the education 'game' is one of the most pathetic grindfests out there.  Games aren't necessarily bad, but when they reward time and effort spent with a low skill ceiling, they are rightly criticized and abandoned.  Rewarding effort ahead of talent in this way weeds out high skill players who go find other games, while allowing for the existence of players just barely capable, but entirely willing to expend extra time.\n\nIf you want to see the disastrous effects of this on academic culture look no further than this:\n\n>that is just a by-product of people being short-sighted and not seeing the merit in funding work that realistically will only have a positive effect in society 20-30 years down the line.\n\nAll of those 'people' involved in funding academia have been through the academic system.  And instead of being taught that insight comes from bold experimentation and creativity, they've been taught that academia is a mindless grind.  The system has created it's own constraint here.\n\nSecondly, the difference between formative and summative assessment.  Summative assessment is the issue we've talked about so far.  You assess students to determine their level of merit produce a score and never think about it again.\n\nFormative assessment is very different.  Formative assessment uses Socratic teaching.\n\n>Their \"novel insights\" will just be wrong because they are based off being taught a simplified methodology that is inherently wrong and where the true methodology is too complex for the majority to understand in a practical time frame\n\nIs key here.\n\nWhich student is better prepared for Einstein's relativity?\n\nStudent A, who has written a summary of their textbook on Newtonian physics that ticks all the boxes.\n\nOr Student B, who erroneously attempted to apply Newtonian physics to light, and found that some of his expectations didn't match reality?\n\nClearly, Student B, through breaching the limits of the simplification, is better prepared for the next level of knowledge.\n\nBut the current academic system would say that this attempt, since it was flawed, and since a student who had (in this case) turned an extra page in their physics textbook could readily have seen that it was flawed, Student B deserves the lower mark.\n\nTrue, paper B is inferior.  But it also produces the necessary conditions to the next phase of learning. The straining of the simplification leading to the questioning of it's truthfulness becomes the foundation of deeper knowledge.\n\nFor all of Student A's 'backbone' it's nothing on the bedrock left bare by Student B's overapplication.\n\nSo when a student gets it disastrously wrong on the back of the simplification, it actually puts them in position to learn better.\n\nAt that point, culling Student B from the program would be absurd.

It isn't fair to specialise people before you show them their other options, therefore they aren't going to have the knowledge to have true insight until they get the opportunity to specialise which will be later in life.

Then again there is a difference between this and putting in little effort and just getting praised for trying, but that is never what it said to do in the first place, so I don't even understand why that is relevant unless that is what people have been doing, and then they are just stupid people, because this isn't a hard concept to understand at its most basic.

In the end essays, projects and reports don't write themselves, they take time to understand, compile, understand and research, this doesn't take natural talent it is a skill that is learnt, as is the same in maths, science, english, french, music, and every other subject out there. Natural \"talent\" really only applies in sport, and that is due to size and muscle mass, the date you are born in year correlates more to professional sport success than many other metrics, and that is due to the kids being the oldest at the time the scouts come round looking at their year.

It is hard to instill a \"growth mindset\" at the point where they are trying to get into university. Also, learning is a process that involves being wrong, making mistakes, and learning from them. Children aren't born with the ability to read and do math, they learn it through a process where they begin making many errors, but this process needs to be encouraged the right way.\n\nSo what do you do when a child worked hard and got it wrong? Like the poster above, it is best to point out what they can do differently on future attempts while still praising the effort. Why? Because if all you do is criticize their attempts by telling them what they could do better even when they try hard, eventually they stop trying. They don't understand that they will get there in time if they keep contributing that level of effort, all they know is that they keep putting in this effort and they still aren't getting any signal that they are doing something right. The praise is the reward that keeps them going through the process of learning.\n\nSome of this also depends on individual differences... \n\nFor example, I work with children at a learning center doing one on one cognitive training every day, and some children are quite aware of their deficiencies and you have to be sensitive about the feedback you give to them. They are so used to criticism and perceived failure after failure to the point that some children I work with dissociate the moment that they get anything even perceptibly negative as feedback or realize they did something the \"wrong\" way. Especially when they have parents and teachers that act like doing bad on a 3rd grade test is the end of the world and they get punished. They don't understand that they will get there in time with practice, and that practice needs to be rewarded, whereas mere criticism is more of a punishment that causes them to recoil from the practice and give up.\n\nAnd then on the other hand I will have those clients that seem to do better with more of a drill instructor sort of method. They tend to be boys that enjoy challenge and competition. Some of them seem to dislike praise as a reward because it makes them feel like \"babies\" or something and they want to feel like \"men\" lol. Some kids will feign the effort which they think they will get by on when I can tell they are half-assing things. The method I use with these kids is often drastically different than the type of kids in the previous paragraph. Some of these kids will try, but be lazy, or some of them will do anything they can to cheat out of not having to think an extra two seconds longer or something. In these instances I praise much less, and I \"punish\" more. For example, if they feign effort or give minimal effort on a procedure, I will tell them they have to do 10 more problems, and then you see the the gears start turning. If they get all the problems correct, they can take a break and play a game instead, which is NOT a method i'd use on the type of kid mentioned previously, which have been beaten by criticism and judgement and will give up, thinking that they will not get them all correct anyways.\n\nAnd then in some cases you will have a student that is a mix of both. Doesn't like or want praise, but is very sensitive about getting anything \"wrong\" (which they need to do in order to learn...), it can be a bit tricky finding the balance of praise and encouragement, while discouraging other behaviors (attempts to cheat, escape, throw tantrums, etc).\n\nIt might also help that I never give them the opportunity to be \"talented\" at something either, since as soon as I recognize something is easy for them I up the ante with more difficult work. But I will praise them on how talented they *became* after working very hard. Saying things like \"see, you used to think you sucked at this, but look at how far you've come, and that's only because you've worked hard at this.\"\n\nSo again, in my experience it is influenced by individual differences in a way. I probably have a different method for dealing with each unique client when it comes to the amount and type of praise or reward that I give them. This brings back /u/not-nice 's point above, that this takes time and an individual relationship with a student to implement effectively, which I have the luxury of as opposed to a teacher working with a classroom full of many students.

It is hard to instill a \"growth mindset\" at the point where they are trying to get into university.\n\nNo, I clearly mention selection from the age of about 6 through to 21, not that any of these ages aren't relevant because the correct mindset for a lot of subject isn't even taught in any worthwhile manner until university level. \n\nSo that makes your point pretty much moot in the first place.\n\n> Like the poster above, it is best to point out what they can do differently on future attempts while still praising the effort.\n\nIs the poster above me, because that is what I said, I don't need my own statements parroted back at me, I wrote them, I know what they said.\n\n>They are so used to criticism and perceived failure after failure to the point that some children I work with dissociate the moment that they get anything even perceptibly negative as feedback or realize they did something the \"wrong\" way.\n\nAnd that really has nothing to do with teaching, that is to do with parenting styles, these children are never going to achieve their full potential because inherently there parents are bad at it. Teachers can't overcome bad parenting with a whole class full of children to work with as well, and unduly focusing on one child is just disadvantaging the rest of the class. All they can do is try and increase attainment and add value, but if they are starting at a lower level, they aren't going to catch up, and studies show this to be true at every level, the gap just gets larger.  \n\nIf the child truly has this problem they need to be put in a separate class where this can be addressed, but that isn't always practical or feasible. \n\n> Because if all you do is criticize their attempts by telling them what they could do better even when they try hard, eventually they stop trying.\n\nIf they don't succeed in anything in all their attempts, then they are doing something fundamentally wrong anyway, nothing has actually been lost by them not trying any more because them trying was actually just time wasting, if you don't focus to remove the fundamental flaw in this paradigm the child is just wasting their time in the first place, they aren't achieving anything trying or not. \n\n> They don't understand that they will get there in time with practice, and that practice needs to be rewarded,\n\nWhich I never said it didn't, doesn't even seem you even bothered to read my comments.\n\n> The method I use with these kids is often drastically different than the type of kids in the previous paragraph.\n\nPersonally I don't think that is particularly effective, it instil the value that they are working because they have too, rather than because it has value and merit and should be interesting to them and useful in the future. It will just lead to students and workers who as soon as someone isn't looking over their shoulder will slack off and therefore fail, be it in revision for exams, the work place or any other situation where motivation is sort from within. Having that mindset is bad in the first place, pandering to it is even worse, they need to be left to fail in tasks where it really doesn't matter if they do, so when a task comes around where it does matter, they put in the effort without oversight. \n\n> And then in some cases you will have a student that is a mix of both.

If so, what are the sociological factors behind it?", "id": "cz0ue64"}, {"comment": "Oh of course it's true.\n\nI can't tell you why. I can say that modern Chinese society is highly competitive in pretty much just every area, part of which manifests itself as people competing with their kids. But I think a lot of parents also just feel like it's their job to push their kids as hard as possible, even if they are not doing it out of a selfish competitiveness. I also think that Asian Americans are particularly bad because it tends to be the least complacent and most competitive/ambitious people who come to the United States.\n\nTwo of my hypotheses about why Chinese society is so competitive are 1. Homogeneity 2. Not valuing individuality, and 3. Lack of stability. For #1, everyone has the same cultural background. The cultural revolution was a big leveler so there isn't much family money around, and the economic expansion happened in a way where if you are adventurous, entrepreneurial, and really smart, you could have made a fortune even if you came from a poor family. So it feels like if you're not successful in apparent ways, it's your own fault. It makes it hard to not envy other people who started at the same place as you and then became immensely successful. People are always comparing each other because it feels easy to do so since we are all the same.\n\nFor #2, in the US, parents can say \"we just want you to be happy\" and accept that their kids might have a variety of interests as they discover their identities. Some people want to be artists, others engineers, etc. Chinese people don't accept this as readily. They feel that there is one thing that everyone should want, and that is a life of prosperity, stability and material success. Everyone is supposed to want to get married, have kids, have a good job and a lot of spare change, etc. So you push yourself and your kids to the path that you think will best help them achieve that. The culture isn't nearly as focused on an individual definition of happiness.\n\nFor #3, we don't have nearly as much of a safety net in China. In the US for example there is EMTALA and Medicaid, etc and it isn't like you will literally die if you can't find a job for a while. (Obviously if you can't navigate the system due to mental illness, lack of education etc it is tough, but there are still a lot of resources in most places.) In China it is much easier, I think, to go bankrupt or otherwise have your life ruined irrevocably. If you're disabled and don't have a good family or a lot of savings, your life is over. Chinese people feel the need to amass a lot of wealth  or other income security so that they feel like they won't be suddenly struck by disaster. I think this is also why we have the stereotype of wanting to go into stable fields like medicine and engineering. Chinese parents have this idea that if you go into art, and you can't find a job for a while, you're just gonna be completely screwed for the rest of your life and depend on them and oh god what are you going to do when they die and how are you gonna find a wife and have babies and what if you literally become homeless etc etc... When in reality you would probably just bartend or sell stuff on etsy or whatever else you can do to make ends meet. That disaster scenario can happen in China (definitely in the 90s, not sure now), so they think it'll be the same in the US.\n\nThat was a lot of rambling.

Wouldn't the particular implementation style be the most important thing? That's my takeaway from all of this, at least.\n\nSort of but I think that's a slightly different question to the one addressed in the article. The article is discussing the difference in promoting growth or fixed mindsets, whereas what you're talking about is a related problem found in intrinsic versus extrinsic reinforcement. \n\nSo in that debate some people argue that extrinsic reinforcement (tangible treats like praise, treats, etc) aren't as good as intrinsic reinforcement (eg loving learning for the sake of learning) because when we indiscriminately praise kids we find that they don't do as good. \n\nBut obviously they don't, if you praise them regardless of what they do then they won't learn anything. Participation awards usually only apply to kids who actually participate so you're still reinforcing trying and effort which should, according to Dweck, promote a growth mindset. \n\nYou're right that some thought needs to go into implementation though, I just think it's a slight side issue and it usually doesn't apply to the arguments raised by people like the user above. The kind of implementation issues discussed in the article were more about whether an approach promoted growth or fixed mindsets - like telling kids it's okay if they aren't good at maths and they should just try their best reinforces the fixed trait idea, and instead we should just focus on their effort and trying.

It's been the attitude expressed in everything I've read about motivation, but are there supported arguments to the contrary in the literature?\n\nSome people might disagree with me here but it's not true at all. Most of the research on motivation that appears to support that conclusion makes the mistake I describe above, where tangible rewards are given indiscriminately and that's taken as evidence that external rewards don't work, are harmful or are simply not as good. \n\nBut it should be fairly clear that this can't be true given that we need to answer the question of how to create intrinsic motivation - we use extrinsic rewards. That's not to say that you should give a kid tangible rewards for a behavior for the rest of their lives, but just that we don't need to appeal to some intrinsic motivator to teach.\n\nGiven how successful behavioral therapies are, which often utilise external rewards should be enough to cause us to question that conclusion. That's not to say we don't need intrinsic motivation - eventually we want all behaviors to be maintained by internal factors but the debate is over the first step of generating good behaviors. \n\n>Yeah, anyone who's read the article would clearly know that nobody here is advocating anything like \"don't worry about it if you suck, you tried, so that's just as good as winning!\" It's not as if researchers are telling teachers to just mindlessly hand out gold stars--it's obviously the opposite, but they'd have to read entire paragraphs to find that out.\n\nExactly.

I hadn't inferred that as the focus of your comment.\n\nI don't think it's true that the only way to create intrinsic motivation is external rewards. That whole integrative-versus-instrumental axis speaks to that--telling someone that working hard to learn a new language will enable them to enrich their social circle can build intrinsic motivation to do so (assuming that's something they value), for example. That is, of course, dependent on their preexisting linguistic ability.\n\nYeah, external rewards *can* build intrinsic motivation--how much of parenting consists of trying to build positive associations with the desired behavior using rewards? And I definitely agree that appealing to intrinsic motivations isn't the only way to teach, especially since sometimes students either don't care or actively want not to learn and need to be more or less coerced. Given that, I don't think there's any realistic way for teaching not to draw on external motivators. With respect to the very first step of generating prosocial behaviors and values, though, I confess my profound ignorance.\n\n>Exactly.

The male warrior hypothesis proposes that success in intergroup contests has been vital in human evolution and that men therefore must engage in maximally effective intragroup cooperation [ 1\u20133 ]. Post-conflict affiliation between opponents is further proposed to facilitate future cooperation [ 4 ], which has been demonstrated in non-human primates [ 5 ] and humans [ 6 ]. The sex that invests more in post-conflict affiliation, therefore, should cooperate more. Supportive evidence comes from chimpanzees, a close genetic relative to humans that also engages in male intergroup aggression [ 7 ]. Here we apply this principle to humans by testing the hypothesis that among members of a large community, following a conflict, males are predisposed to be more ready than females to repair their relationship via friendly contact. **We took high-level sports matches as a proxy for intragroup conflict, because they occur within a large organization and constitute semi-naturalistic, standardized, aggressive, and intense confrontations. Duration or frequency of peaceful physical contacts served as the measure of post-conflict affiliation because they are strongly associated with pro-social intentions [ 8, 9 ].** Across tennis, table tennis, badminton, and boxing, with participants from 44 countries, duration of post-conflict affiliation was longer for males than females. Our results indicate that unrelated human males are more predisposed than females to invest in a behavior, post-conflict affiliation, that is expected to facilitate future intragroup cooperation.\n\n---\nNow I don't know about you, but I'm pretty skeptical about concluding from this study that this may explain, even \"in part,\" why men dominate the workplace. It's certainly an interesting finding, and it's of course *possible* that this may have implications and explanations for the gender differences in the workforce, I just personally think it's quite a stretch, and wouldn't get too excited about it just yet.\n\n"], [60, "If I can speak without citations because I don't have time to pull sources right now... We have known for a long time that women tend to dislike direct competition, and that female-friendly corporate processes encourage cooperation rather than competition to increase female productivity and innovation. \n\nIt's less that \"men are more able to reconcile\" as women's processes for doing so are different. The traditional workplace and sporting competitions (which has historically been created by men as a  \"natural\" way of doing business since it fits *their* style) are not playing to womens strengths. \n\nPerhaps there is a reason why HR and social committees tend to be women--because women need/want to build a more complicated/nuanced workplace culture to promote community and cooperation, while men are just like \"meh, get over it\".

Plus I object to \"replacement\"--you're describing someone who is extremely bad at relationships if they have to resort to \"replacing\" people. That's far from the majority of people, notable exception being the business world, where it's understood *everyone* is replaceable. You're talking about history here; everyone being *this* replaceable was not the case back then.\n\n\"Having to walk away\" does not create causation: it does not imply that any relationships **must** be superficial because they *have* to be easy to break off. They're often not easy to break off at all even when it must be done.\n\n- Does it hurt any less to lose your father or mother, even though you have many friends who can help? No. But your parents eventually die so you'd think by now we'd be jaded and not care; that's not the case. You don't go \"Oh, I have friends now, I really don't care if my parents die, they're replaceable\" (there are exceptions but they're off-topic.)\n\n- Does it hurt any less to break up a relationship, a marriage, even though you might have many friends to help? No. Again you'd think we'd have evolved a mechanism to not give a s**t, but we haven't. Our friends try to tell us \"He/she is replaceable!\" but somehow that doesn't help until we've mourned a bit (exceptions apply).\n\n- Does it hurt any less to be unjustly fired from a job you love and wanted to work at for years, even though you have many friends to help after? No. We've gotten better at brushing this one aside and saying \"That's just how the world works\", but many countries other than the USA don't see it that way and whoever's fired would be mighty pissed off and upset for a long time, and justly so.\n\n*The recovery process* is made easier by having more friends. That's true today; social relationships are an essential component to just about every recovery scenario you can imagine, because it helps to have people you can depend on around you.\n\nBut the break itself still hurts like hell when it's a valued relationship. So having X many other relationships **does not do anything** to evaluate the strength of a particular relationship.\n\nSome people have so much energy in their life they can invest in a high number of relationships at once without taking them for granted; they love hanging out with everyone, they have tons of friends they call every few days, they meet up with business partners often, etc. \n\nOthers don't have as much, and have fewer true friends they care to hang out with, and more acquaintances/more business relationships that exist for the purpose of casual networking and not much more.\n\n**But that doesn't imply the person with more energy is faking it with that many people, or that the introvert won't take his few friends completely for granted.**\n\nLook up [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number), and its critics; the criticism reduces the number from ~150 to 30-50. That's still a fair number of people to have any relationship with; but the number doesn't say anything about their quality.\n\n> Since we're referencing our historical roots as humans, it's to my understanding that guys generally tend to have much fewer of these connections and rely more on themselves or investing more heavily into fewer connections.\n\nLevel of dependence is not the same as quality of connection.", "id": "d689vxq"}, {"comment": "there is another study pointing to male workplace success because of the ability to work in a group of disparate social status individuals, while women don't work well with those they view as \"beneath' them.\n\npretty interesting considering the general perception that women are the ones more likely to \"mediate conflicts as a group\".", "id": "d68yft4"}, {"comment": "I'd love a link to that study since I've found men to be as disgusted by people they see beneath them as anyone else.

The male warrior hypothesis proposes that success in intergroup contests has been vital in human evolution and that men therefore must engage in maximally effective intragroup cooperation [ 1\u20133 ]. Post-conflict affiliation between opponents is further proposed to facilitate future cooperation [ 4 ], which has been demonstrated in non-human primates [ 5 ] and humans [ 6 ]. The sex that invests more in post-conflict affiliation, therefore, should cooperate more. Supportive evidence comes from chimpanzees, a close genetic relative to humans that also engages in male intergroup aggression [ 7 ]. Here we apply this principle to humans by testing the hypothesis that among members of a large community, following a conflict, males are predisposed to be more ready than females to repair their relationship via friendly contact. **We took high-level sports matches as a proxy for intragroup conflict, because they occur within a large organization and constitute semi-naturalistic, standardized, aggressive, and intense confrontations. Duration or frequency of peaceful physical contacts served as the measure of post-conflict affiliation because they are strongly associated with pro-social intentions [ 8, 9 ].** Across tennis, table tennis, badminton, and boxing, with participants from 44 countries, duration of post-conflict affiliation was longer for males than females.

Sit-spots can be a way for people to calm down or even a way for people to have magical experiences. I have had children come up to me after Sit-spot and tell me they felt a deceased relative there with them. That they experienced what it was like to become a tree.

Paracetamol probably works the same way regardless of whether you went to college or not. Age may be a factor in that younger people may be more or less empathetic than older people, and so it may be more or less easy to detect the effects of the treatment. But overall, in this case, it's not like the authors are trying to study something that is heavily dependent on age/education, so that's not my primary concern.\n\nThe 80 person thing... that's complicated. If you got a purely random sample of 1,000 people, and the statistic you were interested in had small standard errors, you would be fairly confident that your results would generalize to the population. That's an ideal case though, and unfortunately, it's one of things that can only addressed by collecting more data. A sample of 40 men and 40 women would probably be enough to tell you that \"on average, men are taller than women\", because that's a large effect. The problem is that we don't know what the effect size of paracetamol on empathy is, and you can't use the effect sizes obtained from *this* study to justify *it's own* sample size after the fact.\n\nSmall sample sizes are sometimes a reality, depending on the type of research (e.g., fMRI researchers can usually only afford to run a small sample of people). The conclusions you can draw from them aren't exactly \"nothing\", but it depends on how much your sample represents the population (i.e., whose data you collected) and how detectable your effect is (i.e., how large is the effect of your treatment).\n\nThere is a secondary problem with small sample sizes which is related, but not redundant with the first, and that is small sample sizes, because they are more variable, are also more susceptible to unintentional (or, sometimes intentional) researcher bias. Choices about whose data to include/exclude, when to stop data collection etc. have larger impacts when sample sizes are small.\n\nIn sum, yeah, it's always better to have more data, but 80 is the sample they have, and I don't think it's helpful to shit on studies with smaller sample sizes without explaining *why* those sample sizes would be problematic in those studies in particular.", "id": "d32wit3"}, {"comment": "I came here to make these points, and you covered all the bases!

The article discussed it mostly from the evolutionary perspective, such as humans adapting to climate change. I think most parents would also agree with me that having young children means you are constantly adapting. They grow and develop so quickly. As soon as you feel you have your shit together, they morph or go through a developmental stage or master a task (climbing out of the crib at 19 months, anyone?) and you're all forced to adapt. As the article mentions, many people have attached themselves to particular styles or parenting with guidelines and rules. We all know those people who have become dogmatic about \"how to parent.\" Since we, as humans, have evolved to adapt to our environments and changes within them, we sabotage ourselves by rigidly adhering to a set of parenting rules. As our children grow and develop and change, so must the ways we interact with them. Our approaches and behavioral management needs to change with them. Only considering options as laid out in someone's parenting handbook (real or otherwise) limits our ability to grow and change with our children. It's hard to do that when you are dogmatic in your perspectives about parenting, particularly if your family's needs change and necessitate an approach vehemently opposed by said parenting perspectives. \n\nI could probably go down a rabbit hole on this and touch on multiple social trends in parenting and whatnot, but I'll stop there. Becoming a parent ushers in a period of constant change and adaptation, in which it is everyone's best interests to also embrace and practice adaptation and change when they \"parent.\"*\n\n*This is, of course, only my opinion based on my own education and life experiences."], [1, "Parents used to whip their kids into shape.

", "id": "d5bv8is"}, {"comment": "Since we're in /r/psychology, there are several perspectives to this, with implications for various areas of development you'll be affecting by just letting your child watch tons of TV. (This ended up being quite long so I'll list my points)\n\n* One is the sociocognitive perspective, which generally posits the child will observe and learn whatever prosocial or antisocial messages and behaviours are in the TV shows. Of course this introduces quite the level of risk, especially since the parents who leave their child with a TV are usually not the types to care much what their child is watching. Also, this perspective coincides with the quite naive 'blank slate' view that people just absorb what they experience, and this forms the basis of everything they need to fully develop. This makes a TV seem to be a perfectly adequate vessel of learning, but virtually all research on development now adheres to a neuroconstructivist perspective, which suggests that your idea of a TV just being good for 'other things' is quite the outrageous statement. I'm not sure of exactly how far you propose we could take a TV upbringing, but I can guarantee you no child psychologist would recommend it if it replaced more involved, healthy activities. \n\n* From a language development perspective, it's good in some ways and bad in others. If you're in a poorer, less educated family, chances are watching TV shows will give you a better grasp of *more*-proper English or whatever language you're watching shows in. I have a friend who learned English by the age of 4 all through TV this way in a non-English speaking country. However, it also means you actually end up communicating less, which generally means you don't get to develop proper social skills. Additionally, the parts of the brain that coordinate the various aspects of social, language and emotional development suffer as a result, and this results in long-term harm. Of course, this needs to be weighed up based on who you'll be communicating with and whether they're a good influence. But in most cases, communicating will be far better than watching TV to develop language. \n\nHowever, from a pure cognitive development perspective, every current and past psychological theory suggests sitting a child down to watch TV is a bad idea. \n\n* Piaget's outdated but somewhat valid stage theory states the child needs to actually interact with things (usually objects or tools) for cog development to occur. TV is not included in these activities I assure you. \n\n* Vygotsky's similar but opposing social theory strongly argues that activities and tasks need to be undertaken with the guidance of an active parent/teacher whatever - otherwise minimal progress if any can be made. \n\n* Going back to modern research, neonativist findings suggest infants *might* benefit from prosocial influences in children's TV, but past a certain point it's clearly better for children to communicate with each other and with adults versus TV. \n\n* Again, neuroconstructivism suggests, loosely, that a constant use of the various brain areas, preferably simultaneously and within healthy social settings, is necessary for healthy cognitive, social, emotional, language and general psychological development. \n\nIn short, within psychology, I know of no finding that could justify or defend regularly sitting a child down in front of a TV, no matter what your goals are. All you will get is a child with lower cognitive, social, emotional and language ability. Also the child will be less healthy physically and this will make them more susceptible to physical and mental illness. From a pure social perspective, they will be lazier because they will grow accustomed to that level of activity, and may end up preferring it to any potentially healthier activity.

I consider it a form of parental neglect, and it produces children who only think about the present, and largely pander to their emotions and impulses rather than thinking about their own health later in life. \n\nRecent psychological research has also suggested that disorders like ADHD, borderline PD and others which share core features of impulsivity, have a strong epigenetic element, wherein the shared family environment (characterised here by impulsivity, neglect, a lack of goals for the future, etc.) actively shapes the child's outcomes and can be considered to worsen, if not 'cause' the onset of ADHD in a child who may not have developed it, or at least not as strongly. \n\nGoing into more depth, in families of low socioeconomic status (who have higher rates of ADHD and similar disorders), it might not only be the stress, poor diet, worse education etc. that contributes to this increase in rates of ADHD, but also the fact that poorer parents are more stressed, work longer hours, and therefore are less able to actively think about the future of their child. \n\nThe writer of the article is noble in her aim of stopping parents treating their children like some sort of project, wherein the parent aims for some form of mastery or success.

So you have to provide those experiences, and shape it so that it can navigate away from the specific attacks it will encounter in any given time period. These attacks are forecast already (school, sexual activity, alcohol/drugs, careers etc.). Where do you begin?

The article discussed it mostly from the evolutionary perspective, such as humans adapting to climate change. I think most parents would also agree with me that having young children means you are constantly adapting. They grow and develop so quickly. As soon as you feel you have your shit together, they morph or go through a developmental stage or master a task (climbing out of the crib at 19 months, anyone?) and you're all forced to adapt. As the article mentions, many people have attached themselves to particular styles or parenting with guidelines and rules. We all know those people who have become dogmatic about \"how to parent.\" Since we, as humans, have evolved to adapt to our environments and changes within them, we sabotage ourselves by rigidly adhering to a set of parenting rules. As our children grow and develop and change, so must the ways we interact with them. Our approaches and behavioral management needs to change with them. Only considering options as laid out in someone's parenting handbook (real or otherwise) limits our ability to grow and change with our children. It's hard to do that when you are dogmatic in your perspectives about parenting, particularly if your family's needs change and necessitate an approach vehemently opposed by said parenting perspectives. \n\nI could probably go down a rabbit hole on this and touch on multiple social trends in parenting and whatnot, but I'll stop there.

So assuming a relatively normal distribution (which may be entirely unwarranted -- if I had to guess, I'd probably say it would be positively skewed), about 70% of the sample or so would have selected 7 or fewer narcissistic items on a non-clinical narcissism scale.\n\nIn short, while I'm not knocking the scale at all, the idea that this has anything to do with \"psychological problems\" is absolutely unfounded. Narcissism may fall on a continuum just like other disorders, but we are clearly talking about people at a sub-clinical level, for whom any inflated sense of self-grandiosity is not a severe impairment to themselves or those around them. Just like anxiety falls along a continuum, but people scoring a little higher than average on that scale aren't necessarily in need of serious help.
