He shakes it off, but after the fight, Palpatine straight up asks him \"you thought of killing me, didn't you?\" (paraphrasing). Knowing full well he can't lie, Vader admits to it. Palpatine commends him for his honesty and they move on.\n* When it's revealed that one of the Emperor's royal guards was a veteran Clone Trooper, seeing his face reminds Vader of his old life as Anakin. He starts getting nostalgic and recalls the battles he served with Rex, Cody, Fives, etc. Palpatine can sense this and doesn't like it.\n* At the end when they are welcomed by a primitive village who have no knowledge of the Empire, Palpatine volunteers Vader to fix a broken radio for them. Vader starts fixing it with basic hand tools, something he probably hasn't done since the Lars' hut in AotC, and was obviously a huge part of his childhood. The process is almost therapeutic to him, and he starts to get feelings about his old life again. Once the village people have served their purpose, Palpatine orders him to go slaughter every single one of them. He intentionally gave Vader the radio to fix so he would reach his most vulnerable point, just so he could basically be like \"Nope, fuck you. Go slaughter a ton of innocent and defenseless people\". \n\nIt's totally possible that he continued this Stockholm relationship with Palpatine for the next 14 years, and maybe finally found some \"peace\" and self-acceptance by the time of ANH.

Once he makes that move (and after the chaos he's seen in the clone wars, IMHO it's an easy one) he can justify all kinds of acts of evil. But we don't see Vader committing mass acts of genocide like Tarkin does in destroying Alderraan. Vader's kills are in the single-digits in Ep IV, V, and VI. \n\nI'll borrow from Robert Mckee in arguing that infact, much of Luke's lucky breaks and escapes in episodes IV and V could have, might have, possibly have been at the will of Vader. How else to explain how the empire couldn't find a kid named Luke Skywalker in the phone book? I wonder if vader didn't jedi-mind-trick the gunner on the star destroyer to say \"Hold your fire, there's no life forms on board\"\n\nSo can bringing order justify everything?

Looking back at the clone wars and the emperor's rise to power, like the emperor, Anakin is clever, inventive, creative in his attacks. A giant planet destroyer seems.....beneath his intellect. Even in ROTJ the death star could arguably have been made not to destroy planets, but as has so often been the case, the emperor deliberately playing on the morals of the rebellion by building another death star for the sole purpose of drawing out the rebels, and then crushing them. \n\nMaybe Anakin is a step ahead of everyone, allowed the plans to fall into the hands of the rebels, appear to be chasing them down and then allowing them to escape....right into the hands of his son, who he could train himself to rule the galaxy with him as his sith apprentice. Knowing full well that starting the training late, like he did, could make him more susceptible to the Dark Side.  \n\nThen, with order returned, maybe, just maybe, with the emperor slain and he and his apprentice son in power, he could make up for all the harm he caused.\n\nAnd maybe, somehow, some way, in a peaceful galaxy, he could finally dedicate the time and resources to find a way through the force, by collecting and studying rare Force anomalies like the Ones and the Force Priestesses to be united with Padme again."], [3, "Read the Darth Vader comics ;)"], [4, "One of the Anthology films should be be about Tarkin "], [3, ">And no one knew who he was (well, maybe Tarkin)\n\nFrom what I remember the Tarkin novel basically says Tarkin has a solid idea of who Vader is but he doesn't have any actual proof.

Bravo.", "id": "cywp3sg"}, {"comment": "I disagree though - there is real evidence that Palpatine's hold on Vader crumbled when Luke surfaced. Remember that first conversation between a helmet-less Vader and Palpatine? It went something like this:\n\n\n    Darth Vader: [kneeling before Emperor Palpatine's hologram] What is thy bidding, my master?\n    Emperor Palpatine: There is a great disturbance in the Force.\n    Vader: I have felt it.\n    Palpatine: We have a new enemy. The young Rebel who destroyed the Death Star. I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.\n    Vader: How is that possible?\n    Palpatine: Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true. He could destroy us.\n    Vader: He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.\n    Palpatine: The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.\n    Vader: If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.\n    Palpatine: [intrigued] Yes... He would be a great asset. Can it be done?\n    Vader: He will join us or die, master. \n\nNow, re-read this, keeping in mind that Vader and Palpatine both knew that Vader was Anakin. Palpatine points out who Luke is, and Vader (in the span of 30 seconds) gives three different trains of thought:\n\n- Disbelief/denial (_How is that possible?_)\n- Dismissal (_He's just a boy_)\n- Alternative solution (_If he could be turned_)\n\nVader did everything he could to keep Palpatine from ordering the death of his son. But it gets better. Everything Vader does from that point on is driven by heavily masked mercy. First off, he sets a trap in Cloud City that involves not killing Han. Then he \"alters the deal\" by saying that Leia and Chewie must never leave the city - a no-brainer move to save their lives after knowing full-well that they are two key people responsible for the destruction of the first Death Star (something Palpatine could not overlook if they were returned to his grasp as prisoners). This new mindset culimnates in the dialogue we hear between Vader and Luke during their first fight:\n\n    Darth Vader: There is no escape! Don't make me destroy you. Luke, you do not yet realize your importance. You've only begun to discover your power! Join me, and I will complete your training! With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict, and bring order to the galaxy.\n    Luke Skywalker: [angrily] I'll never join you!\n    Vader: If only you knew the power of the Dark Side. Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.\n    Luke: He told me enough! He told me you killed him!\n    Vader: No, I am your father.\n    Luke: [shocked] No. No! That's not true! That's impossible!\n    Vader: Search your feelings; you know it to be true!\n    Luke: NOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOO!!!\n    Vader: Luke, you can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny! Join me, and together, we can rule the  galaxy as father and son! Come with me. It is the only way. [Luke lets go of the projection and falls into the shaft]\n\nGet away from the idea that Vader is a typecast villain lying to manipulate a young mind, and Vader is begging for his family to unite for peace, and he is begging Luke for help against the Emperor. Anakin knew what kind of force for peace the Jedi Order was, he would have known exactly how much influence the two of them could have with Palpatine gone. \n\nThe best part of all of this? Palpatine would have seen through the bullshit, and probably made sure that he knew what transpired on Cloud City. Consider Palpatine having this knowledge while you read their conversation from VI:\n\n    Emperor Palpatine: [to a kneeling Vader] Rise, my friend.\n    Darth Vader: The Death Star will be completed on schedule.\n    Palpatine: You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.\n    Vader: Yes, my Master.\n    Palpatine: Patience, my friend. In time, he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.\n    Vader: As you wish.\n    Palpatine: Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen. [laughs wickedly]\n\nThere is a lot of nuance here that can easily be missed if you aren't careful. First off, note how Palpatine is confident that Luke will find Vader - Palpatine would have a vast spy network, and that conversation on Cloud City was nowhere near over. Then of course, Palpatine wants Luke in front of him for whatever conflict is to come - he no longer trusts Vader as he did with the first Death Star. On top of that, it lends to the idea that the Emperor knew what went down at Jabba's Palace, and that he's seen how much Luke has grown as a Jedi. He doesn't mention Yoda, and still treats Luke like he's blindly following his own path to the Force. In other words, Palpatine isn't relying on massive force skills nearly as much as he is on traditionally collected information. \n\nIt goes on:\n\n- Vader captures Luke on Endor, and utters the words \"_Your skills are complete_. Indeed you are powerful as the Emperor has foreseen.\" This is very different from the Emperor's viewpoint that Luke is still a runt in need of training. \n- When Luke offers again for his father to turn back, Vader responds, \"You don't know the power of the dark side! I must obey my master.\" Like at Cloud City when he asked Luke to kill the Emperor, Vader seems to be literally powerless against the Emperor, like the hold goes beyond manipulation. \n- Luke says that Vader will have to kill him, to which Vader replies, \"If that is your destiny.\" Except at Cloud City, Vader firmly stated Luke's destiny - destroying the Emperor.\n\n\n**TL;DR It's my belief that Palpatine knew what went down at Cloud City, he knew from early in ESB that Vader was falling away from the Dark Side, and he thought that he could turn a self-led young Luke to the darkside by getting him to kill off Palpatine's biggest threat - Vader. The entire 2nd death star, the entire trap laid for the Rebels on Endor, is merely to draw Luke to Vader while at the same time crushing the Rebels. Palpatine walks with no resistance, and a new and powerful apprentice.**\n\n_This theory also lends itself to one of my other theories, that Vader brought balance to the force by being in control of, rather than controlled by, both sides of the force._", "id": "cyxadi6"}, {"comment": "When you wrecked OP this hard, [did you feel the slightest remorse?](http://i.imgur.com/sWKwve5.gifv)", "id": "cyxdv2s"}, {"comment": "Holy crap!

The prequels answer that nicely: his fall to the Dark Side isn't because of a greed for power, but more on the fear for his family, and making whatever \"hard\" decisions, no matter how evil and wrong, to keep that from happening (think Michael Corleone in Godfather 2).\n\nThe end of Episode 3 shows that entire loss.  There's no reason for him to become powerful, because his motivations were for his family.  I don't necessarily agree with the original theory, but possibly?  If anything (and supported by the comics) he realizes Luke is his son.  Obi-wan being with some kid, and feeling the Force in someone that destroys the Death Star, doesn't make it hard to put two and two together.\n\n>When he learned his son was alive, Force sensitive, and fighting for the Rebellion, he knew he had an opportunity to have the family he never had, and an opportunity to destroy the Emperor.\n\nAgreed.  It's the double-edged sword that keeps him in limbo, on the edge, between the Dark Side and Light Side.  The family that provides for love and peace also is the motivation for the fear.  It's what the Jedi, funny enough, don't understand (because the marriage itself was kept very secret) and why Luke was given the singular choice of destroying Vader, but which the Emperor understood all too well to be able to manipulate Anakin to the Dark Side.\n\nIn the end, it's the family bond, Luke's own love and willingness for sacrifice, that brings Anakin back to the Light.\n\nI'm curious to know whether Vader would have actually killed Luke though if the tables were turned.

Padme's death and the presumed demise of his children is clear indication that he was completely wrong.  There's a possible admission that he'd been wrong about the Jedi, but the sins were so enormous that there's no real possible retribution for those actions.  He fights Obi-Wan because he must, and yeah it's to settle a score, but he's... sort of numb.  \n\nThe thing is, Vader isn't exactly *dogmatic* about the Dark Side, at least I didn't think so.  His argument to Luke is that, well, they're powerful and if he doesn't he'll be destroyed.  He doesn't really have a great reason, unlike how the Emperor really coerced and manipulated Anakin to turn.  In fact, Vader appeals through family to be more convincing.

Obi-Wan's in the Death Star?  Thanks, Vader will be hunting him alone.  There are a few rebel ships that separated from the rest during the Death Star attack?  Vader's going to grab a few pilots and go chase those.\n\nTarkin's obviously the boss, but at the same time, Vader's obviously not a regular subordinate.

Vader starts fixing it with basic hand tools, something he probably hasn't done since the Lars' hut in AotC, and was obviously a huge part of his childhood. The process is almost therapeutic to him, and he starts to get feelings about his old life again. Once the village people have served their purpose, Palpatine orders him to go slaughter every single one of them. He intentionally gave Vader the radio to fix so he would reach his most vulnerable point, just so he could basically be like \"Nope, fuck you. Go slaughter a ton of innocent and defenseless people\". \n\nIt's totally possible that he continued this Stockholm relationship with Palpatine for the next 14 years, and maybe finally found some \"peace\" and self-acceptance by the time of ANH.

Vader's kills are in the single-digits in Ep IV, V, and VI. \n\nI'll borrow from Robert Mckee in arguing that infact, much of Luke's lucky breaks and escapes in episodes IV and V could have, might have, possibly have been at the will of Vader. How else to explain how the empire couldn't find a kid named Luke Skywalker in the phone book?

Even in ROTJ the death star could arguably have been made not to destroy planets, but as has so often been the case, the emperor deliberately playing on the morals of the rebellion by building another death star for the sole purpose of drawing out the rebels, and then crushing them. \n\nMaybe Anakin is a step ahead of everyone, allowed the plans to fall into the hands of the rebels, appear to be chasing them down and then allowing them to escape....right into the hands of his son, who he could train himself to rule the galaxy with him as his sith apprentice. Knowing full well that starting the training late, like he did, could make him more susceptible to the Dark Side.  \n\nThen, with order returned, maybe, just maybe, with the emperor slain and he and his apprentice son in power, he could make up for all the harm he caused.\n\nAnd maybe, somehow, some way, in a peaceful galaxy, he could finally dedicate the time and resources to find a way through the force, by collecting and studying rare Force anomalies like the Ones and the Force Priestesses to be united with Padme again.", "id": "cywzl4k"}], [{"comment": "Read the Darth Vader comics ;)", "id": "cyx2qam"}], [{"comment": "One of the Anthology films should be be about Tarkin ", "id": "cyx4ec9"}], [{"comment": ">And no one knew who he was (well, maybe Tarkin)\n\nFrom what I remember the Tarkin novel basically says Tarkin has a solid idea of who Vader is but he doesn't have any actual proof.

In attack of the clones when he and obi-wan meet for the first time, he tells him that the republic has fallen under the control of a sith lord. He also says that he is working against this sith lord. \n\nLater on, we see Dooku leading the execution of the main heroes, but it is worth noting that his allies, like nute gunray, are calling for their immediate execution where as Dooku calls for patience. Then when the jedi come to the rescue and get their asses handed to them, he offers a truce. If he is now an evil killer ruled by passion who wants to exterminate the jedi, why would he do these things? \n\nLater Dooku fights Obi-wan and Anakin. Despite being one of the most respected duelists in the galaxy and now powerful with the darkside of the force, he kills neither hero. Initially he just roughs them up a little, and anakin only loses his hand when he goes for round two. He does drop a column on the heroes but not until after yoda has shown up and proven himself perfectly capable of saving them. \n\nIn return of the sith, again he fights obi-wan and anakin. This time he throws obi-wan like a ragdoll, knocking him unconscious and pinning him under some debris. Clearly he could have just as easily killed or maimed obi-wan, or anakin too for that matter, but he didn't. The heroes survive unscathed. Meanwhile Dooku goes through all of the (live action) movies not killing a single person. Does that sound like a sith lord? \n\nDooku had Palpatine on his ship,unarmed and chained to a chair. Wouldn't a real sith, who hungers for power, take the opportunity to become the master? Instead he is killed while looking at palpatine like a sad puppy. It is also notable that Dooku was on the losing end of the war. What sith would agree to that? The eradication of the jedi required order 66, palpatine planned to wait to issue that order until the jedi attacked him, the jedi would not attack him until the war was over, and the war would not be over until Dooku was killed. This raises the question of why Dooku would decide to become a sith anyways. He was considered an excellent jedi and was still respected by the high council years after he left, so it wasn't pride. His actions in the movies show he wasn't interested in power. He talks to sidious about wanting to eradicate the jedi, but he was a jedi, and presumably was trained from a young age as a jedi, so fellow jedi are all he would ever have known. He has no love interest like anakin. He definitely wasn't indoctrinated into the sith, presumably having been trained specifically to resist that. Why would Dooku have any reason to want to aid Sidious in his plan?\n\nI think instead Dooku has willingly joined with Sidious so as to discover the sith plan and help to destroy the sith once and for all. By putting on a good show and playing a major role in the plan, he learned more and more about it. Sidious had learned not to put himself in a position where his apprentice could easily kill him, and even if Dooku did kill him its possible that palpatine's plan would still eradicate the jedi even if palpatine were dead. By playing along, however, he could come up with a counter strategy.", "id": "cxzk8hc"}, {"comment": "Thank you so much for this writeup! It makes sense the way you described it.

The fact that Dooku didn't seem to think it odd that Palpatine was waiting so long to reveal himself would seem to suggest he was always waiting for the jedi to make the first move, a piece of sith wisdom he had passed on before.

But in the end he has controlled himself.  Its appropriate that Luke's lightsaber is green, which in the visible light spectrum is between the blue of the Jedi and the red of the Sith.  And if we do want to borrow something from the prequels, Luke truly has brought balance to the force: both Jedi are dead, both Sith are dead, all that remains is Luke  Skywalker, user of the Force.\n\nUnfortunately this all gets wrecked by everything else in the prequels and other works.", "id": "cxzh2l1"}, {"comment": "I don't see how the prequels wreck this theory, if anything they reinforce it. In the original trilogy, the jedi we meet are space wizards, but they don't really give the impression that the jedi order has any weird teachings. Everything they say is just \"mind over matter\" wisdom stuff. The Sith, meanwhile, are just shown to be evil evil evil. What's wrong with emotions and passion? Obi-wan's reasoning that Vader can't turn back to the light is simply because he's more machine than man, he doesn't say anything about feelings leading people down a one way path. \n\nThe prequels tell us that the jedi are all about restraint and that the sith are all about passion. We see the hypocrisy of the jedi, how they call themselves peace keepers as they wage a war, how they see the sith as something to be eradicated but won't acknowledge their hate, how they are blind to the dark side in their midst. At the same time we see the sith, and in particular the fall of anakin skywalker. He starts out as a good kid, but his desire for love and his other attachments leads him down a dark road while he is also a hero of the republic. We see the shrewdness of palpatine, but at the same time see the corrupt beast he is trying to overthrow. Most of all, we see how the jedi and the sith's competing philosophies lead to death and destruction. \n\nReturning to the original trilogy, Luke breaks the cycle. He is given the martial training of a jedi, but none of the philosophy. He is never taught to suppress his emotions, or to sever attachments. He has close friends, he has romantic interests (which admittedly don't work for other reasons), and he gives up his jedi training to save them. He has also never been taught that the descent into darkness is a one way path, as obi-wan and yoda had assumed. \n\nEventually we get the confrontation on the second death star. The jedi had told luke he must kill vader, it is his destiny. The sith tell luke to kill vader, it is his destiny. Luke rejects both of these parties, and takes control of his destiny. He throws down his lightsaber. He says \"I am a jedi, like my father before me\". We know of 3 jedi from all of time and he picks the one who stopped being a jedi. \n\nFurther, at this point in time jedi was just short for jedi knight. In the real world you don't just decide to be a knight, you get knighted, and who knights you is important. By declaring himself a knight, luke breaks the long tradition of the jedi order knighting people, and assumes that power himself. He is the first of a new order, and order very different from obi-wan or yoda, and order like anakin skywalker, his father. Luke ventured into the dark side without turning completely evil, and he declares that anakin is the same way. Vader proves this claim true. \n\nLuke rejects the false dichotomy of the jedi and sith, and his new order, through the actions of anakin skywalker, brings balance to the force. \n\n", "id": "cxzkpxb"}, {"comment": ">I don't see how the prequels wreck this theory\n\nIt wrecks part of it.

In many movies, and this one in particular, we should never assume that the characters are telling us the truth. \n\nYou are right that the point of the final scene is that it doesn't matter whether the world is real or not, Cobb has accepted that - but I also think that he knows where he is.

Besides the number of spins as someone pointed out earlier, I don't see how the top being special leads credence to it being odd. Anyone who sees a spinning top rotating indefinitely would think it's weird. If it's reversed as the OP noted, then that still doesn't make sense. A top that falls down in the real world makes sense. A top that spins is odd. A loaded dice that always lands on 6 is odd. Would be an automatic giveaway. I don't see the top's behavior being reversed than normal. \n\nOP points out how intently Cobb stares as the totem. In the end with Saito, he seems lost in Limbo during his conversation with Saito about \"being young men again.\" Only when he looks at the top that Saito himself picked up and spun did he really understand what was going on. The top was still spinning, not falling over, and he knew it was a dream. The top was spinning the whole time and he wasn't intently staring at it \"willing it\" to keep spinning. \n\nIt's a complicated movie but I think the top behaves the way it's supposed to be.

Mal decides that she's going to use a spinning top as a way of telling if she is in her own dream, because she sets up the rule in her dream that once she spins the top it will spin forever. She doesn't tell anyone because they could easily set up the same rule themselves if they knew she was using it as an indicator, so whenever anyone else is in charge of the rules or she is not in a dream the top will fall. She hides it so nobody discovers it, because seeing it spin indefinitely would be a dead giveaway.  \n1.  Mal decides that she doesn't care if she's in a dream or not and lays the top on its side, keeping it in its hiding place, so that if she ever looks at it again, she'll think it has fallen and she's in the real world.  \n1. Cobb is desperate for them to get out of the dream world while Mal thinks it's real, because she's forgotten and relies heavily on her indicator  \n1. Cobb, being the master extractor he is, discovers the location of her secret and figures out its purpose (which he had at least ~50 years to do), then starts it spinning indefinitely again so that it would now appear correctly to Mal that she's in the dream world.  \n1. Cobb finds a way to get her to check on the top to make sure she's in the real world without indicating he knows about the secret, and she discovers the spinning top that tells her the world she thought was real is not.  \n1. After train suicide in Limbo, this perception of her world not being real continues and she can't shake it, so she tries to get Cobb to commit suicide with her, but just dies instead  \n1. Cobb starts doing extraction again and explains the idea to his team of the \"totem\", which is a device where only you know the specific behavior, because you can then use the behavior to determine if you are in a dream or not. I don't think it necessarily has to behave normally in a dream and abnormally in real life or vice versa, it just has to have behavior that only you know and you can draw your own conclusions from it.   \n1. Cobb doesn't actually carry his wedding ring in real life but creates one whenever he enters a dream, which nobody notices for some reason. The wedding ring may or may not actually be his totem because it'd be easy to figure out, but he doesn't actually care about that as much. He's more interested in figuring out if Mal was actually right when she said their world wasn't real, in which case the rules she set up would have the top spin forever when he spins it.  \n1. Cobb goes on some crazy adventures and determines that he doesn't care if he's in her dream anymore or not, so he leaves the top behind. "], [1, "I really like this theory! But the architect designs the physical layout of the dream, not the physics, right? The dreamer supplies that with their existing understanding of how things work- however, when dreaming, the dreamer doesn't always get the details right. IRL a common trick to achieve lucidity is to teach yourself to check your watch or phone or something as a habit; then, when you do it in a dream, if the watch behaves abnormally (not showing the right numbers, not moving at regular speed), you will know you're dreaming- essentially a totem. So the loaded dice not landing on the right number isn't because an architect designed your dice wrong, it's because the dream state's physics aren't perfect.

I actually think it's the closest I've seen anyone get to a coherent theory that explained the ending from an artists intent POV. I never liked that ring theory for the same reasons you said - it's actually the more obvious totem as it's in plain sight and always thought it was just a symbol to show how Cobb still thinks of himself as married. I just like sethgipson1's theory more as my own personal head canon as it makes sense and avoids some of the problems I had with inception.\n\nI've actually thought the spinning top was relying on the fact a spinning top is a natural example of a chaotic system. You may have to stick with me here as I haven't watched the film in years (it's nowhere near my favourite Nolan film) and it's been a couple of years since I studied. \n\nDon't read this if you know what a chaotic system is.\n\n*But a chaotic system is not what it sounds like - a chaotic system is not chaotic. It refers more to that fact that small variations can have a massive change on the output. From Wikipedia   \"When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.\" So as an example imagine a magical black box with a dial to put numbers in you put in the number 1 and it spits out the number 2 you put in the number 2 and it spits out the number 7 you know exactly what the relationship is for each number you put in but if you mess up and put 1.00005 it will show you 8 instead of 2. It's actually thus impossible for you to predict the outcome because it's beyond your capability to actually guarantee its on 1 and not 1.00000001 using the dial despite the fact that you can technically describe the relationship mathematically. A chaotic system is thus a system whose result is technically calculable but where the smallest variation can change the answer so drastically that the system is essentially unpredictable.*\n\n\nSo that was my actual theory when i last watched the film. Cobb's totem is genius for the very simple reason that it's impossible for anyone to actually calculate it's spinning pattern since it would require an inhuman amount of accuracy to get its exact detail right to the point it can be replicated. But when he uses his totem, he isn't imagining a spinning top and calculating it's behaviour - he just remembers exactly how he spins it and the corresponding spinning pattern which is a stretch but hey its a movie about entering dreams. And wasn't Juno a physics major or something so shed get why he chose a spinning top because it's virtually impossible to replicate a chaotic system as the smallest variance completely throws the pattern off vs an object that's heavier than it looks which the other person just needs to get hold of to make a copy close enough that you can't tell the difference. So if someone wanted to trick him they'd have to watch him actually spin the top in reality and remember the pattern as opposed to the other items which just required you to get a hold of them.\n\n\nEdit: I just realised the potential symbolism of Cobb abandoning his totem. A chaotic system is actually a direct parallel to how a lot of people view life. It's deterministic but unpredictable eg God has a plan but he works in mysterious ways - there's a 'planned/calculable' result and although it seems random, it's not.

Mal decides that she's going to use a spinning top as a way of telling if she is in her own dream, because she sets up the rule in her dream that once she spins the top it will spin forever. She doesn't tell anyone because they could easily set up the same rule themselves if they knew she was using it as an indicator, so whenever anyone else is in charge of the rules or she is not in a dream the top will fall. She hides it so nobody discovers it, because seeing it spin indefinitely would be a dead giveaway.  \n1.  Mal decides that she doesn't care if she's in a dream or not and lays the top on its side, keeping it in its hiding place, so that if she ever looks at it again, she'll think it has fallen and she's in the real world.  \n1. Cobb is desperate for them to get out of the dream world while Mal thinks it's real, because she's forgotten and relies heavily on her indicator  \n1. Cobb, being the master extractor he is, discovers the location of her secret and figures out its purpose (which he had at least ~50 years to do), then starts it spinning indefinitely again so that it would now appear correctly to Mal that she's in the dream world.  \n1. Cobb finds a way to get her to check on the top to make sure she's in the real world without indicating he knows about the secret, and she discovers the spinning top that tells her the world she thought was real is not.  \n1. After train suicide in Limbo, this perception of her world not being real continues and she can't shake it, so she tries to get Cobb to commit suicide with her, but just dies instead  \n1. Cobb starts doing extraction again and explains the idea to his team of the \"totem\", which is a device where only you know the specific behavior, because you can then use the behavior to determine if you are in a dream or not. I don't think it necessarily has to behave normally in a dream and abnormally in real life or vice versa, it just has to have behavior that only you know and you can draw your own conclusions from it.   \n1. Cobb doesn't actually carry his wedding ring in real life but creates one whenever he enters a dream, which nobody notices for some reason. The wedding ring may or may not actually be his totem because it'd be easy to figure out, but he doesn't actually care about that as much. He's more interested in figuring out if Mal was actually right when she said their world wasn't real, in which case the rules she set up would have the top spin forever when he spins it.  \n1.

Adding a second fictional layer in which the movie is also fiction achieves nothing: Harry Potter is the story of someone reading a book about a wizard, ocean's 11 is the paranoid dream of an art collector, star wars is just a story a kid is making up for their toys, whatever. All of these stories will be completely the same.\n\nSpoilers for fight club, repo, The Princess Bride\n\nThere are situations where similar theories work - when only part of the story is imagined, or when there are dreamlike elements that need explaining. A couple movies do this textually very well. Fight Club has a single character be a dream, which allows for many scenes to be interpreted completely differently. In Repo, the end of the movie is a dream, and it works well enough by snatching away the happy ending. The Princess Bride isn't a dream, it's a book being read, but materially they're very similar. It lets the viewer in on the joke, communicating that you're watching a silly movie without any cheap laughs. This one only works because it's not a fan theory, though.\n\nInception usually comes up here, but I don't think it counts. If the dreams are tangible and characters can interact in them and further the out of dream plot, we aren't really talking about dreams.\n\nIn general, \"it was a dream\" is just a way of adding the appearance of depth to a movie.

Through the beginning of the movie,we've seen flashes of Tyler in the background over and over again (he's spliced between frames during Jack's low points, at the copier, the doctor, in a men's meeting, and when Marla is leaving). Up until now we've not seen Jack really interact with anyone in a genuine way (and we're still not, really) but no one has directly confronted him except Marla. These relationships Jack has aren't genuine since they're all based on lies (his relationship with the men in the group and Bob, Marla (her lie reflected my lie), and even his relationship to his job and with his boss). Jack's a fraud and Tyler is the first one that confronts him (Jack confronts Marla, not the other way around) on it in a healthy way: \"What do you do for a living?\" \"Why? So you can pretend you're interested?\" \n\nThis is the exact place that Jack had fantasized about dying (I think he's sitting next to a black woman during the fantasy) earlier in the movie. It's fitting because he's essentially starting to die by giving Tyler more and more control and embracing giving up his whole life. Since Tyler wants to be the one who is making all the choices now, he asks if Jack wants to switch spots. Jack knows he can't actually help with the escape from his own life like he desperately wants to (but Tyler can). \n\nTyler: \"Wanna switch seats?\" \nJack: \"I'm not sure I'm the particular man for that job.\" \n\nMetaphorically Jack is telling Tyler he can't take care of himself in an emergency situation (which is basically his whole life) and that Tyler should do it. Tyler has already blown up their apartment and he needs a reason for Jack to reach out more so they can get through it (here's my card), get Marla, and help Jack get the life he wants.\n\nedits: Wording and clarity.

It's really a subtle turning point in a lot of ways. Through the beginning of the movie,we've seen flashes of Tyler in the background over and over again (he's spliced between frames during Jack's low points, at the copier, the doctor, in a men's meeting, and when Marla is leaving). Up until now we've not seen Jack really interact with anyone in a genuine way (and we're still not, really) but no one has directly confronted him except Marla. These relationships Jack has aren't genuine since they're all based on lies (his relationship with the men in the group and Bob, Marla (her lie reflected my lie), and even his relationship to his job and with his boss). Jack's a fraud and Tyler is the first one that confronts him (Jack confronts Marla, not the other way around) on it in a healthy way: \"What do you do for a living?\" \"Why? So you can pretend you're interested?\" \n\nThis is the exact place that Jack had fantasized about dying (I think he's sitting next to a black woman during the fantasy) earlier in the movie. It's fitting because he's essentially starting to die by giving Tyler more and more control and embracing giving up his whole life. Since Tyler wants to be the one who is making all the choices now, he asks if Jack wants to switch spots. Jack knows he can't actually help with the escape from his own life like he desperately wants to (but Tyler can). \n\nTyler: \"Wanna switch seats?\" \nJack: \"I'm not sure I'm the particular man for that job.\" \n\nMetaphorically Jack is telling Tyler he can't take care of himself in an emergency situation (which is basically his whole life) and that Tyler should do it. Tyler has already blown up their apartment and he needs a reason for Jack to reach out more so they can get through it (here's my card), get Marla, and help Jack get the life he wants.\n\nedits: Wording and clarity.

In the British version it's all an awesome joke because it closes with Tim saying it's just a \"trifling\" matter. Well that's awesome because a trifle is both the name of a small problem and a dessert. So they have this exchange about the stapler and Tim gets in this killer joke. Then David asks the new intern what he should do and he says he should take Tim into \"custardy\" which is another dessert joke.   \n\nSo when I started watching the American version I had already seen this, and when I saw Dwights stapler in jello I just thought it was an awesome nod and \"in joke\" to fans of the original show. Then Jim apologizes and tells Dwight he's his biggest flan, which is an awesome play on words since it almost sounds like he says he's a fan of Dwight but really he's making a joke about how similar flan and jello are.   Then Ryan tells Michael he should have put Jim in custardy and we've completed the scene because now not only is it an homage to the original it's actually lifted entirely from the scene...but they couldn't lift the trifle joke because in America we don't use the word trifle as much as the British and also because we don't have a dessert called trifle here.   \n\nSo when I saw that scene I was like \"oh that's a nice homage\". Then When Jim says he was always Dwights biggest flan I went \"oh shit! They worked in an entirely different joke because trifle wouldn't work but they made it play here!\"   \n\n\nI had been worried that basically the show was going to be a straight knock off because literally everything up to that point was 100% how the Britsh show was. But as soon as Jim delivered the flan joke I knew it was an homage and not just a case of joke stealing and I realized the writers were really clever.  \n\nEverybody just remembers the stapler in the jello no one remembers the word play and because of that people miss telnet real joke of both versions. In both versions Tim/Jim have clearly thought of a perfect witty rejoinder ahead of time and the new interns have shown they're quick on their feet, Gareth/Dwight are shown to basically be humorless...and in both cases the real laugh is that David/Michael think they are the funniest ones in the office. But neither can think of a joke.  And it's demonstrated very clearly in the Anerican version because David closes the scene by saying \"Pudding.  Pudding ... I'm just trying to think of other desserts\". He's missing an incredibly clear open joke: \"Jim, stop pudding Dwight's stuff in jello.\"  He's thought of pudding... But he misses the opportunity, because he's not that funny.   \n\nAnd that to me is why that scene is awesome beyond just the humor of Dwights stapler being in Jello. It's a perfect tailored homage to the original and not simply joke stealing and it subtly reassured fans of the original that it was going to be the same as the original and also different at the same time, and clever enough to stand on its own merits.

I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable (as far as reason in a fictional book about magic goes) that the killing curse left his body momentarily dead, therefore the horcrux\u2019s container is destroyed.  Stopped heart and all.  Fin.  \nThe killing curse did it\u2019s job of killing the container right dead or else we wouldn\u2019t have seen both souls there in limbo.  While in limbo, Harry\u2019s soul is stronger than Voldemort\u2019s \"pitiful\" piece so yeah he can choose to go back, for whatever reason. \n\n2.  Harry dropped the resurrection stone so he didn't even have it on his person at the time of death, nor had anyone picked it up to recall him.  Both legend and Harry's use of it prove that is has to be turned over in hand to draw back loved ones.  Harry's returned family were \"neither ghost nor truly flesh\".  In the legend, Cadmus Peverell's returned lady was unlike her former self, but Harry comes back wholly and not belonging back among the dead.\n"], [2, "Very late to the party but I had always interpreted the legend of the hallows to be referring to Harry.\n\nAs in the legend of the Hallows says that the one the master of all 3 hallows will master death itself.

Rowling established this early on. The Resurrection Stone is her furthering that theme, in that it cannot do what it promises, and only brings back a 'shade' of the person; more substantial than a ghost, but not true resurrection. I would go so far as to say that true resurrection is impossible in the Harry Potter universe."], [1, "If you read the book Dumbledore tells Harry he was the Horcrux Voldemort never intended to make. He is a Horcrux Voldemort killed that part of Harry not Harry himself "], [1, "Great fan theory. Although it hinges on the necessity for death when tapping into the old protection magic Lilly used to protect Harry. However, it only mentions the need for sacrifice not death. I view this old magic in the same vein as wandless magic. It requires drastic mental will and usually gesture. It is not stated anywhere that you have to actually die. Secondarily the magic at play in the forest sacrifice is complex, Harry is a human horcrux, we don't know the rules for human horcruxes(it may not need be destroyed like the book, cup, etc. Vold was knocked to the ground as Harry was, this implys some magic effected them both(the killing curse focused on the only part of Harry that was not in control of the elder wand) and Harry's sacraficial old wandless magic used the destruction of the Vold in side him, what he thought was going to be his own soul, as a trigger to cast the same protection magic Lilly cast on him, except cast on all those in the castle.\n\nThe rest of Harry and Vold's interaction lies heavily in wand ownership.

IN the case of Harry disarming Malfoy, the wand was half a country away.", "id": "d74y9x4"}, {"comment": "Wandlore is weird. It seems like wands have a very basic...consciousness, I suppose. Ollivander's whole wand chooses the wizard thing was the first inkling we get of that, but there's the potential for that being subverted by the coincidence of Harry getting the \"brother\" of the wand that gave him the scar. The concept of changing allegiances seems to confirm it though, because it seems like a wand would have to be able to sense the intent behind an action. Lockhart's wand didn't change allegiance because Snape wasn't intent on Lockhart not having a wand anymore, he only meant to demonstrate and maybe make him look like an idiot. No allegiances changed in the dueling club because the intent of the children was to practice, except in the case of Malfoy and Harry, who just wanted gloating rights over the other. Now when Draco disarms Dumbledore, he doesn't want the wand, there's no reason to think he even knows about the Elder Wand or the finer parts of wandlore. But he does intend to take Dumbledore's wand away from him in the sense that he doesn't have quick access to defend himself with it. He didn't want to kill him, but I feel like he could've been goaded into it, on top of choosing to save his own skin over Dumbledore's. Snape just saved him the hassle. So the intent to take a wand in general seems to be what switches the allegiance. This is further shown because at the time Harry takes Malfoy's wand, he doesn't know they can switch allegiances. He just intends to take the wand so Draco doesn't have the means to kill his friends readily available. So for Harry to own the Elder Wand after that it would seem like a wand has to know who it's master is at any given point, and it has to sense the intent to take a wand away from someone to switch its allegiance. That both the blackthorn wand and the elder wand switched allegiances despite the lack of proximity to the elder wand would suggest to me that the original wand of the owner would bind to the elder wand, if they still have a wand at the time of the taking. I'm not sure if the blackthorn would have bound to Harry's holly wand, as the elder wand seems to be one-of-a-kind.\n\nAs an aside, all that stuff I just said makes me think Dumbledore took a gamble on the elder wand's allegiance dying with him, and based off of the one wizard taking the wand after slitting it's owner's throat, I don't think he'd have won that gamble. Draco disarming Dumbledore is the reason Harry won his final exchange with Voldemort.\n\nTl;dr wands are conscious to recognize an owner and the intent behind disarmament in order to change allegiance, and the elder wand binds to the owner's original wand unless the original owner doesn't have one anymore.", "id": "d75vck9"}, {"comment": "Intent is definitely a \"thing\", in magic. \n\nIt's why Snape using Avada Kedavra to kill Dumbledore didn't split his soul, he was doing it as a kindness (to stop Dumbledore dying a more painful, black-hand related death) with Dumbledore's permission. \n\nI think some wands yield to power more than others in a means reflecting the sort of wizard that they choose.

Captain America received word from the Army Review Board Agency late yesterday that his applications for promotion to General, back pay from 1944 to present, and request for medals of valor were all denied. Steve Rogers, alias \"Captain America\" was disappointed, but said he would try again next year.\n\nRogers based his requests on common actions done on behalf of soldiers who are missing in action or prisoners of war. Based on the length of time missing, under the POW/MIA guidelines, \"Captain America\" should have been promoted with his peers to at least Colonel, if not General. He should also have been granted back pay, at current rates, for the time he was missing.\n\nThe ARBA, made it's decision on several factors: That Steve Rogers enlisted into the Army fraudulently, that he was never actually promoted to Captain, and that he disappeared while detailed to the USO on special duty. Records uncovered in the investigation show Rogers attempting several times at different recruiting stations to enlist before finding one that would let him in despite his 4-F rating. Fraudulent enlistment is a crime punishable under the UCMJ [and the Articles of War before 1951].\n\nA spokesperson for the ARBA also mentioned that no records could be found commissioning Rogers as an officer of the U.S. Army. \"We checked all commissioning sources - ROTC, Officer Candidate Schools and direct commissioning programs for records of a Steve Rogers or Captain America, but found none.\" Said Sgt.

Captain America received word from the Army Review Board Agency late yesterday that his applications for promotion to General, back pay from 1944 to present, and request for medals of valor were all denied. Steve Rogers, alias \"Captain America\" was disappointed, but said he would try again next year.\n\nRogers based his requests on common actions done on behalf of soldiers who are missing in action or prisoners of war. Based on the length of time missing, under the POW/MIA guidelines, \"Captain America\" should have been promoted with his peers to at least Colonel, if not General. He should also have been granted back pay, at current rates, for the time he was missing.\n\nThe ARBA, made it's decision on several factors: That Steve Rogers enlisted into the Army fraudulently, that he was never actually promoted to Captain, and that he disappeared while detailed to the USO on special duty. Records uncovered in the investigation show Rogers attempting several times at different recruiting stations to enlist before finding one that would let him in despite his 4-F rating. Fraudulent enlistment is a crime punishable under the UCMJ [and the Articles of War before 1951].\n\nA spokesperson for the ARBA also mentioned that no records could be found commissioning Rogers as an officer of the U.S. Army. \"We checked all commissioning sources - ROTC, Officer Candidate Schools and direct commissioning programs for records of a Steve Rogers or Captain America, but found none.\" Said Sgt. Timothy Winters, an investigator for the review board. \"We even checked possible 'battlefield commission' reports.

The only reason many of them can afford those large social programs, besides high tax rates, is because they don't need to spend as much on their military for protection because America covers that. \n\nAnd I disagree with the Iraq war, I don't think we should have started that at all. But don't act like Iraq was some beacon of peace and all we did was kill civilians. A better comparison would be for America to go into your house because they want your beer and to kill a child molester hiding in your basement and then they shit on the floor. Then they come back and clean up the shit. \n\nAnd people were bitching when we weren't immediately involved in fighting ISIS, they bitch when we don't send more aid to poor nations, and they bitch when we don't stop every fucking abuse under the sun.\n\n>  And you did the classic American thing of being so arrogant when you know nothing about how the world perceives you. I never said saying God bless X means don't bless y. I just question the morals of a human who would bless the American military. I never said I think dictators and terrorists are innocent either. Seeing what you want to see. How very American of you.\n\nI said god bless x doesn't mean don't bless y because it felt like you were implying that it does. And I pointed out dictators and terrorists aren't innocent because you acted like all we do is shoot children and puppies. \n\nWe aren't a nation of terrorists, we're the one that's killing them and we could do a better job of how we go about that. The world does need us and you'd be fucked if our military wasn't there.", "id": "d2ony7s"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d2op274"}, {"comment": "> The terrorist were already there because you created them! They are a reaction. Do you really believe that one day some poor people in a resource rich country woke up and decided to start a war with the most technologically advance military on the planet? Do you think they started blowing shit up for the fun of it?\n\nI'd like to point out what you say just a few lines later;\n\n> I'm not an idiot terrorism existed thousands of years ago and will continue after AmericA. \n\nSo did we cause the terrorists or have they always existed? And what actions are you referring to when you say that our military 'started it'? Don't forget that we've dealt with Islamic terrorists more than 100 years ago and Islamic groups have been attacking the west as a whole for over 1000 years (not to say the west is completely innocent of course).\n\n> in some states you can be fired for being gay\n\nNot true\n\n>  If you get cancer your in debt for the rest of your life. \n\nIt's possible but not an absolute. And by comparison to Europe they do have the socialized health care but they also have a much higher tax rate and don't have to spend as much on their military. For many people they would be saving money in an American health care system.\n\n> Intitutinal racism in the police force\n\nHas been greatly overstated. There are racist assholes but overall the police aren't really some bastion of racism.\n\n>  No mental health treatments for people who need it.\n\nWe do have mental health treatment, we just need to improve it.\n\n> Guns everywhere\n\nIt's great isn't it.\n\n> mass shootings\n\nAre a problem that comes with a combination of extremism and our mental health system which needs improving. And they're also a very small percentage of shootings overall.\n\n> The nsa spying on its citizens and foreign leaders such as merkel\n\nAnd other countries spy on their citizens as well.\n\n> The cia testing drugs on people illegally (mkultra) a history of false flag attacks (tonkin).\n\nYes, an actual problem with my nation's history. \n\n\nAnd what do you think our military actually does? Yes, we do have troops in the middle east, but we also guard every fucking shipping lane in the world and protect our allies and have bases in almost every one of their countries (which allowed them to spend less on their military and more on their social programs). \n\nAnd to speak of issues Europe is facing; you remember the Friday 13th attacks? The ones done by Islamic extremists who had come over with those waves of migrants? Did America cause that as well? Is every Islamic terrorist attack America's fault now even though we've been dealing with similar groups for over 100 years?\n\nAlso, where did you get that the British are the best trained military in the world followed by the French? I'm not insulting their forces, I just don't know what the standard it.\n\n>  And do you honestly believe the American military acts the way it does out of the goodness of its heart to help our poor under-defended nations, no it does it for its own self-aggrandisation, power and resources,nothing else.\n\nI agree with you. I also don't see that as a bad thing. Our military protects and empowers us. Could they do a better job of that? Of course, like I said I disagree with our involvement in South America during the Cold War and the Iraq War as well. \n\n> I love a good debate so thanks for that pal.

Involves a scientific explanation/theory of the basis of Quicksilver's mutation.**\n\n---------------------------\n\nI think OP's theory is very interesting, especially considering Quicksilver and the way he perceives the world so much differently, even when compared to other mutants. \n\nI grew up with, and was diagnosed with, autism, and the way that OP and others have described how Quicksilver sees the world struck a familiar chord with me. While I certainly don't have superhuman speed, as an autistic person, what my brain lacks in social skills (10x less than a normal person), it has compensated for by forming more connections and faster \"neural pathways\" in my brain. This causes my brain to often times work faster than a normal person's on a processing level.\n\nThe discovery of \"autistic people tend to have faster processing skills\" is a recent one by scientists in the past few years, mostly through case studies that examine the brains of autistic volunteers. One such volunteer was Temple Grandin, a professor of animal science at Colorado State University, who was also diagnosed with autism. [Here is a scan of Temple's brain, when compared to a control (non-autistic) test subject.](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eca5b3f03be168c6b3e6ec526067fd90ae7bcfe3/r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/USATODAY/GenericImages/2013/05/01/xxx-tg-image-for-usa-today--4_3.jpg). Temple's brain is the one on the left; the control is on the right. \n\nThe rainbow pathways represent neural connections in the brain. On the right side, we have the neat, orderly, \"normal\" brain structure of an average, non-autistic person. On the *left*, however, you see a brain that has formed *ten times the connections and neural pathways of a \"normal\" brain at the very least*, causing what some psychologists call \"hyperconnection\". [Here is another image for reference.](http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/schneiderlab/images/HDFT_Grandin2.png)\n\nIn the second image, Temple has \"ten times more motor-to-visual\" neural pathways and connections. Scientists also documented this \"hyperconnectivity\" phenomenon in other autistic subjects through the same type of brain scans.\n\nIn a similar manner to how autism affects the brain, Quicksilver's inheritance of the mutant gene from his father, Magneto, likely affected his brain structure somewhat, causing similar \"structural abnormalities\". Given his differences from other mutants, Quicksilver could also have \"a mutation of a mutation\", in which the Mutant X gene that he inherited *further* mutated when he was conceived, thus resulting in Quicksilver's radically different thought processes, behavior, and perspective.\n\nIn this same vein, Quicksilver's mutation likely interfered with development of normal neural wiring and brain development while he was still in the womb. As for Quicksilver's repetitive thoughts and actions, which are also reminiscent of autism, that points to Quicksilver having a difference in limbic circuits in his brain as well.\n\nThe structures of the limbic system are involved in motivation, emotion, learning, and memory. It is highly interconnected with the nucleus accumbens, which plays a role in sexual arousal, and the \"high\" derived from certain recreational drugs. In the same vein, we see Quicksilver not doing drugs, but instead doing else that could be termed as \"giving him a high\": stealing things, and playing video games.\n\nThe limbic system is also connected part of the basal ganglia called the striatum, which controls posture and movement. From what we can tell, Quicksilver's striatum has been changed as well by his Mutant X gene, causing his ability of super-speed, as well as giving him control over his posture and movement while exercising his power. \n\nLikewise, the limbic system involves the hippocampus, also likely affected in Quicksilver's brain by his mutation, at it involves various forms of cognition, learning included. It is not only responsible for the formation of memories, but recall of these memories, and something called \"neurogenesis\". That is, when a subject is subjected to many different forms of mental and physical training, there is an upsurge of new neurons and neural circuits in the hippocampus as a result of the training, causing an overall improvement in the learning of the task.\n\nWe see Quicksilver, as /u/MasterLawlz says, \"rigging a tape recorder to play music at a thousand times the normal speed of the song; he made Pong move so fast that the audience couldn't even process him playing it\". These are all signs, not only of Quicksilver challenging himself physically and mentally, but also showing clear learning skills to complete his goals. It also shows that Quicksilver not only processes the world much faster than others, other mutants included, but also *thinks* much faster.\n\nThere is also another theory to consider: the Quicksilver remains in his mother's basement, because due to the way he processes the world, *everything* could end up being overwhelming to him. After all, his brain is processing *everything* around him at the speed of light; his senses are constantly being bombarded. Similarly in autistic patients, Quicksilver also shares an extremely high level of energy and \"intense level of focus\". \n\nQuicksilver, also like those with autism, lives in his mother's basement, clearly avoiding loud and otherwise social situations.\n\nIndeed, there is even an article about a go-kart racing champion with autism, one that seems to echo exactly how Quicksilver is portrayed as in *Days of Future Past*.\n\n> Austin Riley of Uxbridge, Ontario, is a 16-year-old kart racing champion.\n\n> He\u2019s also autistic.\n\n> Though Austin is high-functioning on the autism spectrum, he struggles in loud and social situations \u2013 like racetracks \u2013 and still needs help securing his helmet and tying his shoes.\n\n> But when he pulls his kart out on course, he races wheel-to-wheel with the best, and leaves the spectators on the sidelines with mouths agape from amazement.\n\n> \u201cWhen we got the diagnosis that Austin had autism, we thought life was going to be difficult and there was no future,\u201d recalls Austin\u2019s dad Jason Riley.\n\n> But instead of feeling sorry for themselves, the family decided to seek an outlet for the high energy and level of focus that accompany Austin\u2019s disability, one that could give him confidence and enrich other aspects of his life.\n\n> Jason remembers a brief sojourn into soccer that saw Austin kick a goal and then sit down on the field begging to go home. When they found karting, an activity that Austin could excel at and would also engage in with vigour, they knew they\u2019d happened on something magical.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s all he thinks about, dreams about, is driving something,\u201d Jason says.\n\n> [...] \u201cWe put Austin in it for the first time and he looked more comfortable in that than he did in the go-kart he had been racing for three years previous,\u201d Jason says. \u201c**Every time we speed him up he looks more comfortable because the kart is actually moving at the same speed as his mind.** It\u2019s an amazing thing to see.\u201d\n\n> The point about Austin\u2019s mind moving quickly may not resonate with those who think of disability as equating to slowness, but it\u2019s one that others who know Austin agree on.\n\n> **\u201cHow I see Austin is his brain works so fast,\"** says Jessica Benge, an Australian education assistant specializing in disabilities. [...] **\"The faster Austin\u2019s world is, the more comfortable he is,\u201d** Benge says. **\u201cIf the world can keep up to his pace then he\u2019s going to be much more comfortable with life.\"** [(Source)](http://www.prnmag.com/features/2837-racing-with-autism-moving-at-the-speed-of-thought)\n\nIn the film, Quicksilver's habits of stealing things, and holing up in the basement playing video games, also points to a classic case of mental and emotional withdrawal, due to anxiety and stress, or another reason.", "id": "d3txuzd"}, {"comment": "Your comment was fascinating.

Some say we are oblivious, but we can tell, especially when our interests, instincts, and behaviors differ so vastly from those of \"normal\" children.\n\nYour reply rings true, in that autistic people can be far more intelligent, perceptive, and aware than most others give them credit for. The same way we see Quicksilver rise to the occasion, performing jaw-dropping feats at the Pentagon, one might initially assume otherwise of him due to his home habits.\n\nAutism is certainly an interesting condition, one in which many aspects still remain a mystery.

The reason why ash is always in the middle of it all is because he is the main character in the video game he is playing, he is the player we are following, the streamer of some sort to say it some how, but all other pokemon trainers go through similar adventures as their level progresses as well, all pokemon trainers have had the lugia experience to say it somehow... this is also the reason why pokemon can be transfered from a computer to another, is also the reason why pokeballs have mirror like structures inside (to project the hologram) it is also the reason why pokemon trainers never get injured although they are just mere meters away from massive explosions and things like that, it is also the reason why pokemon can be cured with the press of a botom in pokemon centers, and is the reason why pokemons dont die during battles, nor do they create resentment towards their trainers for making them fight again and again, that also explains their level of inteligence and why they all understand human language and comands, it also explains why the pokedex has the info of all pokemons encanutered, probably because the pokedex is the main wireless computer running the video game for each player, and it mainly explains how pokemons can fit inside those tiny Pokeballs as well...\nPokemons are holographic characters with advance ai of a really advance augmented reality video game that is perfectly layered on top of the real world creating an entire new economic, social and cultural structure... This is also the reason pokemon pre history is so weird and yet nobody seems to really care nor do you see it been part of the common knowledge of people, it is because all the pokemon past \"history\" is really just the lore for specific side quests, once a player gets to certain level or location specific side quests are activated, some times this pokemon video game hosts massive online events as well, pokemons first movie is a story about a pretty elite secret side quest... It is no secret the pokemon world is pretty advance technologically, it could be that this online augmented reality ai populated video game has existed for so long that it has become a fundamental part of their economy and culture, in other words the pokemon world is the future of our world once holograms, ai, video games and aumented reality gets advance enough, and just like with any video game people are not constantly remembering everyone that this is just a game, the entire culture is inmerse in this game, and to an extent probably even big chunks of their economy depends on this level of immersion to continue.... It is probable that every citizen has augmented reality contact lenses to see pokemon, pokemon tournaments and stuff like that, but in order to actually start playing the game you need a pokedex, to store all the info and AIs you download and an oficial starter as well, also pokeballs to download more pokemons from the online server and to holographically project them later on... \n\nThe pokemon world is just the future of our world once aumented reality video games are advance enough... :) its just pokemon go Version 6000.0 it might very well be the solution for future unemployment hehehe "], [1, "Well, thats boring.

Furthermore, they already milked his character in the prequels by setting up his origin story.\n\nFurthermore, Bobba Fett is not a meaningful character and never was meant to be. I guess they decided to throw him into the prequels because of the cult following among star wars fans that developed around him, so even if your theory turns out to be correct, I think it would be a terrible plot twist to reveal. \n\nThe Star Wars storyline is already caught up heavily in trying to link characters between the trilogies and as you pointed out, Rey's origins are probably going to have a big impact on the story, so it seems like a pretty strange creative choice to take a minor character from the original trilogy and make him the focal point for the conflict in the new trilogy.\n\n"], [6, "Boba Fett is the most overrated character in star wars.

He also initially wants Rey to be brought to him after learning she is force sensitive.\n\nThis is a dumb theory based on conjecture and loosely connecting \"evidence\" just like the Jar Jar nonsense last year.

The last time we saw Boba Fett, he was being digested in a Sarlacc Pit. Digestive stomach acid plus decades of using the darkside could very well leave a much older Boba Fett looking just like Snoke does.  \n  \n**BOBA FETT IS FORCE SENSITIVE** \u2013 Some consider him Force Sensitive from the amount of Midi-chlorians that would be in the remarkable DNA he received from Jango Fett and his sheer toughness in the Star Wars universe. He is not strong enough to be a Jedi or Sith though, which could explain why Snoke is neither. Again, the official canon has never said Boba Fett is Force Sensitive, but it's never been said that he wasn't either. Perhaps if Boba was discovered by a Jedi as Anakin was, he would've reached an even greater power. So that being said, many have debated whether or not Boba Fett is indeed Force Sensitive and both side make very good points, but consider these facts for a moment...  \n\u2022 Jango drew and gunned down an armed jedi.  \n\u2022 Jango went toe to toe with Obi-Wan Kenobi and not only survived, but nearly killed him!  \n\u2022 Jango qualified as the blueprint of the ultimate soldier.  \n\u2022 Boba outflew/outgunned/outdid four IG-88s in short order.  \n\u2022 Boba's only non-jedi threat in a quick-draw is Han Solo (and he's as fast as his ship).  \n\u2022 If Boba survived the events of Episode 6, then he did so while keeping his mind intact in the maddening telepathic belly of the Sarlecc.  \nOne could definitely make the argument that no ordinary being could accomplish such minor miracles...  \n  \n**\u2022 BOBA FETT'S REVENGE** \u2013 Think back to the moment when Snoke tells Kylo Ren that Han Solo is among those who have possession of BB-8- specifically HOW he says the name *Han Solo*... It's with such disdain  and disgust that it's almost as if he HATES Han Solo (not unlike how like Boba Fett would)... Kylo's murder of Han Solo would not just be out of the scorn of a son, but revenge for the disfigurement of Boba Fett by Han in Episode 6. Boba having been an ally of Darth Vader would very much attract the dark side in Kylo... And let's not forget that [Boba watched as his father was beheaded by the Jedi, Mace Windu](http://i.imgur.com/9XP2T3l.gifv).\n  \n**\u2022 MANDALORIANS?** \u2013 The most seemingly obvious clue to the involvment of Mandalorians was [seen at Maz Kanata's castle](http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/ZZ346657C9.jpg), but let's take a look at how similar [Kylo Ren's mask](http://i.imgur.com/Rckjr26.jpg) & [Captain Phasma's body armor](http://www.sideshowtoy.com/assets/products/902582-captain-phasma/lg/star-wars-captain-phasma-sixth-scale-hot-toys-902582-05.jpg) is to the [armor Boba inherited from Jango] (http://www.starwarshelmets.com/2009/orig_Jango_Aotc04.jpg). Is it possible that Boba Fett has modeled the Knights of Ren after the [Mandalorian Knights](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mandalorian_Knights)- who were made up of Jedi Masters that defied the Jedi Council and joined the Mandalorian Wars during the time of Revan.

Now, to touch on the fact that fett wasn't a force wielder.  I don't think that would really matter.  Their are still many dark side entities in the galaxy that weren't Sith.  Take the Sith witches of zabraak.  They could be helping in the training of you Kylo.  Maybe other players that we don't yet know about as well.  Well that's my take on it.  I could be using too much from the expanded universe, but who knows.  They may make our wishes come true and start using stories from the EU"], [1, "I've seen at least a few depictions of Boba with a similar scar on his head too. probably coincidence."], [1, "Interesting, but definitely, definitely wrong. Don't take it too badly when this turns out to be incorrect."], [1, "This all seems plausible except for the part where Boba Fett is Snoke. The only piece of evidence would be the deformity of the face.\n\n\nAny enemy of the rebellion would hate Leia and maybe Han, but seeing as how Leia is the \"General\", breaking her would be more important. I say Snoke is a new character who has been around in the Empire somewhere, who tries to defeat his enemies on a more personal level. I don't see Boba Fett there."], [1, "I've thought about this possibility as well. The problem for me is that the Snoke theories are getting really tiring, because almost every SW character has been rumored to be Snoke at this point. Even fucking Lobot. At this point I would appreciate if he really just turns out to be a new character. Still, there's something there. \n\nTo add to the tinfoil: I dont think your theory will necessarily turn out to be true, mind you, but a lot of things you mentioned stood out to me as well, especially the Mandalore thing. I think it's really interesting that both tv shows have put a lot of focus on Mandalore and its connection to the overall lore of the bigger Star Wars universe. Both shows are canon.\nThe Clone Wars also included a story line in which (SPOILERS) Darth Maul of all people became the temporary leader of Mandalore. So we have a militaristic warrior society who were at one point led by a powerful dark side user (who was technically not a Sith at that point), with a huge grudge against the Jedi, the Sith and the Republic all at the same time. This would kind of fit with what we've seen from The First Order so far. JJ Abrams has said multiple times that Snoke and Kylo are *not* Sith. \n\nRebels included both these elements, Mandalore and Maul, into their ongoing story line. It seems like it's still somewhat important to the story group and the overall universe. \nAlso, \"Wren\" (pronounced Ren) was introduced as a mandalorian clan name on that show. \n\nI think there could be *some kind* of connection there, or rather the possibility to make that connection if the story group actually decides to go that route. If Snoke actually *is* Boba Fett, the creators could point at the new expanded universe and go \"see, it's there! Mandalore, its connection to the Dark Side, young Boba,... We planned it all from the very beginning!\"  \nI'd still roll my eyes, though. Literal Boba Snoke would be kind of lame. If anything, I'd like to have all these things woven together in a little more subtle way. \n"], [1, "The biggest flaw here is assuming \"it\", in the context of Leia and Han's dialogue, doesn't refer to Kylo's fall. \n\nObviously, in film, \"just because the viewer didn't see it doesn't mean it didn't happen\" is always true. That said, deliberately misleading the viewer is generally bad practice, outside of foreshadowing or the withholding of information for suspense. It's not common for a film to include a major plot element that the viewer has literally no way of figuring out. \n\nIn other words, there is literally nothing at all that would lead the (average) viewer to think they were not talking about Kylo. So if it is indeed referring to some other event then JJ was deliberately and directly misleading the viewer, which I find unlikely.

He may or may not be force sensitive, he wouldn't need to be for the sake of the story anyway. He could easily corrupt Kylo Ren to the darkside without being force sensitive.

I wouldn't describe Snoke's tone as particularly contemptuous in that scene at all, it actually stays pretty level throughout the conversation. He says the name slowly but I always thought that was because this was a dramatic revelation, and so they chose a take with the slow delivery to punctuate the scene. Even if his tone could be described as contemptuous there are plenty of people in the galaxy who could have a vendetta against Han Solo. He's a famous Rebellion general.

So if he was already pulling strings around the clones *and* Jango, it's not much more of a stretch to say any of these:\n\n1. Palpatine was keeping an eye on Jango's clone son to maybe be a replacement for himself if Anakin didn't work out (backup plan)\n\n2. Boba Fett maybe wasn't a perfect clone of Jango, because Palpatine made the cloners do something to make Boba have latent force sensitivity.

He saw that ruling based on the dark or the light side of the force failed, but also saw that the power in those individuals would be useful in establishing control, that the fate of the universe became a stage for family issues because of the power they held to shape it.

The last time we saw Boba Fett, he was being digested in a Sarlacc Pit. Digestive stomach acid plus decades of using the darkside could very well leave a much older Boba Fett looking just like Snoke does.  \n  \n**BOBA FETT IS FORCE SENSITIVE** \u2013 Some consider him Force Sensitive from the amount of Midi-chlorians that would be in the remarkable DNA he received from Jango Fett and his sheer toughness in the Star Wars universe. He is not strong enough to be a Jedi or Sith though, which could explain why Snoke is neither. Again, the official canon has never said Boba Fett is Force Sensitive, but it's never been said that he wasn't either. Perhaps if Boba was discovered by a Jedi as Anakin was, he would've reached an even greater power. So that being said, many have debated whether or not Boba Fett is indeed Force Sensitive and both side make very good points, but consider these facts for a moment...  \n\u2022 Jango drew and gunned down an armed jedi.  \n\u2022 Jango went toe to toe with Obi-Wan Kenobi and not only survived, but nearly killed him!  \n\u2022 Jango qualified as the blueprint of the ultimate soldier.  \n\u2022 Boba outflew/outgunned/outdid four IG-88s in short order.  \n\u2022 Boba's only non-jedi threat in a quick-draw is Han Solo (and he's as fast as his ship).  \n\u2022 If Boba survived the events of Episode 6, then he did so while keeping his mind intact in the maddening telepathic belly of the Sarlecc.  \nOne could definitely make the argument that no ordinary being could accomplish such minor miracles...  \n  \n**\u2022 BOBA FETT'S REVENGE** \u2013 Think back to the moment when Snoke tells Kylo Ren that Han Solo is among those who have possession of BB-8- specifically HOW he says the name *Han Solo*... It's with such disdain  and disgust that it's almost as if he HATES Han Solo (not unlike how like Boba Fett would)... Kylo's murder of Han Solo would not just be out of the scorn of a son, but revenge for the disfigurement of Boba Fett by Han in Episode 6. Boba having been an ally of Darth Vader would very much attract the dark side in Kylo... And let's not forget that [Boba watched as his father was beheaded by the Jedi, Mace Windu](http://i.imgur.com/9XP2T3l.gifv).\n  \n**\u2022 MANDALORIANS?** \u2013 The most seemingly obvious clue to the involvment of Mandalorians was [seen at Maz Kanata's castle](http://i2.wp.com/bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/ZZ346657C9.jpg), but let's take a look at how similar [Kylo Ren's mask](http://i.imgur.com/Rckjr26.jpg) & [Captain Phasma's body armor](http://www.sideshowtoy.com/assets/products/902582-captain-phasma/lg/star-wars-captain-phasma-sixth-scale-hot-toys-902582-05.jpg) is to the [armor Boba inherited from Jango] (http://www.starwarshelmets.com/2009/orig_Jango_Aotc04.jpg). Is it possible that Boba Fett has modeled the Knights of Ren after the [Mandalorian Knights](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mandalorian_Knights)- who were made up of Jedi Masters that defied the Jedi Council and joined the Mandalorian Wars during the time of Revan. They embraced the Mandalorian culture and called themselves the Mandalorian Knights... But where's the connection to Kylo?... [His lightsaber](http://imgur.com/tn8hHJ6)! \n  \n**\u2022 BOBA FETT SURVIVED!** \u2013 In the new CANON book *Aftermath* there's a scene where someone's scavenging Jabbas sail barge and they find Boba Fett's empty armor outside the sarlacc with acid burns. Plus he's also even mentioned by name...  \n  \n> Mercurial\u2019s eyes flash to a nearby rooftop. His eyes go wide. His jaw, slack.

Both shows are canon.\nThe Clone Wars also included a story line in which (SPOILERS) Darth Maul of all people became the temporary leader of Mandalore. So we have a militaristic warrior society who were at one point led by a powerful dark side user (who was technically not a Sith at that point), with a huge grudge against the Jedi, the Sith and the Republic all at the same time. This would kind of fit with what we've seen from The First Order so far. JJ Abrams has said multiple times that Snoke and Kylo are *not* Sith. \n\nRebels included both these elements, Mandalore and Maul, into their ongoing story line. It seems like it's still somewhat important to the story group and the overall universe. \nAlso, \"Wren\" (pronounced Ren) was introduced as a mandalorian clan name on that show. \n\nI think there could be *some kind* of connection there, or rather the possibility to make that connection if the story group actually decides to go that route.

And it\u2019s done in the same way that Aladdin becomes Prince Ali - by getting the clothes, riches, and people bowing to him.

If this theory were true, then why did Genie make Aladdin wish for him to save his life? We learned earlier in the movie (rescuing Aladdin from the cave) that Genie is capable of doing things for his masters without needing them to wish for it. If Aladdin surviving were really part of his first wish, the second wish would be unnecessary. The only argument I could give for this one is that Aladdin NEEDED to make a second wish in order to use a third wish, so Genie was trying to speed along the process to his own freedom. Which brings me to...\n\n4.

If Aladdin surviving were really part of his first wish, the second wish would be unnecessary. The only argument I could give for this one is that Aladdin NEEDED to make a second wish in order to use a third wish, so Genie was trying to speed along the process to his own freedom. Which brings me to...\n\n4. If Genie was trying to get Aladdin to be a prince so that he could be set free, then why was he pressuring Aladdin into setting him free before he actually became a prince? True, the night before Genie starts pressuring Aladdin, Jasmine announces that she chooses \"Ali\" as her husband, but he's still not a prince yet, according to this theory.\n\n5. In the scene when Jasmine announces that Ali is her choice, the sultan announces that Ali would become sultan, not prince. You could argue that he didn't explicitly say that the *marriage* would make him sultan, but that's how I always took it.\n\n6. If we are sticking with legalities, Genie states in the end, \"Just say the word, and you're a prince again,\" hinting that he was legitimately a prince the first time.", "id": "dazwxg6"}], [{"comment": "> teleport's\n\n> it's conclusion", "id": "dazzcz6"}], [{"comment": "You left out the most important part - that the Genie also saw his own freedom through fulfilling Aladdin's wish.

"], [287, "No. Michael hates Toby because Toby is the worst human being ever. God. Why is this hard?"], [118, "My theory is a little different. I think he hates Toby, because Toby is the only person who actually wants friendship as badly as Michael. Michael doesn't see the irony, but Toby's quest and desire for a friend is offputting to Michael, because Michael wants the same thing. So he sees Toby as the loser, weird, nerd that Michael despises. "], [92, "It's interesting, but there's really nothing to support this theory. Plus, HR reps being hated is kind of a running gag in the show until you get to Holly. David Wallace mentions to Jim when he's interviewing for Jan's job that he'll probably get along with everyone except their HR person because David doesn't like their HR guy just like Michael doesn't like Toby. It's pretty subtle. "], [64, "I always thought Michael hated Toby because he was \n\nA. Jealous that Toby had a wife and child\n\nB.

I've seen the series about 10 times through already so I must've missed something "], [35, "I always thought it's because basically Toby is the opposite of the American dream.  Michael Is a huge idealist - he lives in his own \"fantasy world\" he says.  Toby lives relentlessly in the real world.   Michael is like a Disney kid and Toby is CSPAN.  Michael is always hoping a big grandiose miracle is going to happen - wife/kids/fulfillment - Toby is living proof that he might be waiting in vain. "], [21, "michael likes darryl a lot though and he is a father who isn't married to the mom. I think Tobys winney voice and his passive soft spoken way of pointing out when michael acts out (even though its out of obligation and he doesn't come down hard on him) michael doesn't like that. he doesn't like that anyone in the office has any power over him because he likes being the boss. so here is a winey soft spoken guy who is almost like his babysitter from corporate that he has no respect for. thats why i think michael doesn't like him. "], [19, "Toby is the Scranton Strangler and Michael always feels uneasy and a little afraid of him like a little kid or an animal would be.\n\nHe never grew up so he doesn't function like an adult and relies on his instincts to keep him safe."], [14, "He starts out hating Holly though purely because she's HR. It's a very quick change to liking her, but it demonstrates how it's based on pure hatred of HR."], [13, "There isn't much that we know about Michael and Toby's relationship prior to the show. We just know that Michael hates HR and Toby by extension. His general grievance is that Toby is the worst because he prevents the office from being \"fun\".\n\nHere is my theory. One thing we know about the office prior to the show starting is that Michael was best friends with Todd Packer. Now Packer is pretty much a jerk who pulls awkward and annoying pranks. But him and Michael got along probably because they were the two social outcasts of the office. Eventually Michael was promoted to Branch Manager and Packer became the traveling salesman. My theory is that Packer pulled some prank or said something so outrageous that he got in trouble with HR and Toby reprimanded him. This forced Packer to be a traveling salesman and no longer work in the Office proper because his behavior was too disruptive. And Michael never forgave him for it because he was his only friend in the office.\n\n**tl;dr** Michael hates Toby because Toby reprimanded Packer and forced Michael's only friend out of the office."], [10, "this is an interesting theory, but when Jim gets promoted to manager we see him start to get mean to Toby too. \n\nThe actor who plays Toby is actually the showrunner. It's my pet theory that the managers of the Scranton branch have to hate him because they're the imaginary bosses and he's the actual in-real-life boss. "], [9, "I'm gonna chime in with my own theory here, because that seems to be the thing to do in this thread.   Michael hates Toby because Toby has no distinct/cultivated personality.  \n\nMichael's understanding of the world is shown to be informed broadly by generic stereotypes and broad generalizations.   Mostly he interacts with people through the lens of the stuff that you'd see on old TV sitcoms or from a comedy routine (almost like Abed from community in this sense - but more internalized) because he's socially phobic and can't understand how to interact with people except through a rigid (albiet typically not serious) set of predefined rules with the expectation that it'll somehow make people like him.  This expectation is derived from the fact that (as he says) \"comedy makes people laugh, and people really love to laugh\" - and for the fact that he is [desperate for friendship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxzC25lAkqI)\n\nSo, for example, when he interacts with Oscar he doesn't really interact with what Oscar is saying or doing, but rather with the predfined expection of what a Latino/gay man might do/say in a comedy routine.  The same thing goes for Jim, who he sees as the popular guy (despite the fact that Jim is kinda an asshole, and almost everyone in the office is mostly unimpressed by him) and thus Michael looks to him for Validation.  I think this comedy archetype framing is most obvious with Kelly Kapoor, who he'll ocassionally treat like an India-born immigrant rather than someone who's lived in America all her life.  An Indian-American daughter of immigrants does not fit into a comedy sketch anywhere near as well as a Indian immigrant would, so he chooses to interact with the version of her that fits what he expects people to find funny, despite its incongruity with reality.\n\nSo where does Toby fit into all of this?  Well, Michael is hardly the only person to point out that Toby is a bit dry of personality.  Jim, Ryan, and even Pam all reference it at some point, and his other interactions with other characters show that they'd rather not be around him simply because of how dry he can be (the exception to this is the fancy lunch club).  I know the whole \"Toby is the Stanton Strangler\" theory is fun, but if you look at the running gag about his obsession, and what it's actually implying...he's talking about it because the only thing interesting about him was that he served on a jury for some half-famous case that most people forgot about.   He's literally trying to milk it for all it's worth, because otherwise people find him incredibly dull.\n\nSo while this is somewhat expected and not usually a reason to hate someone, for Michael it is.   Don't forget, his entire social framework is determined by making comedic generalizations about people in an attempt to make them laugh, so that they'll like him.  But he can't do this with Toby.  There's nothing there to poke fun at, because there's nothing really there at all.   He's not fun, he's not funny, and nothing about him can even be construed to be funny (as is the case with characters like Oscar and Stanley, who are also both incredibly dull - but at least have stereotypes that Michael can frame them in to spice them up, and make them more comedically relevant).   So Michael hates Toby because he can't functionally relate to him in any way.\n\nIf you need any more evidence to support this theory, take a look at his interactions with all the other characters:\n\nThe charaters he tends to generally dislike are (in order of most to least) Phillys, Merridith, Gabe, and Angela.   The one commonality between these characters is that they all have \"weak\" (or subtle) personalities with no distinguishing traits that he can latch onto for the sake of his comedy routine.  When he does show appreciation for a character like Phillys, it's never in a comedic sense.  He's always casting her as a \"venerable old lady\" despite the fact that they're literally the same age - he wants to fit her into some mold that television tells him that people will like/relate to, so he works with what he can.\n\nNow granted, this isn't all there is to Michael Scott - obviously his relationship with Ryan, Dwight, Jim, and Pam are shown to be more complex - and this is because the writers want to make it clear that he is not LIMITED by design, but rather self-limited in this regard.  In fact, much of Michael Scott's conflict comes from this conflict between what his self-limitations and his real feelings (like, for example, the entire Jan arch). When he actually gets to know someone, and they make it inside his weird little bubble, he's shown to be able to have a real relationship with them even if that relationship is (as is the case with Ryan) simply to reject the easy generalization, and substitute it with his own real understanding of their person.  But for a charcter like Toby, who never makes it past the first layer, all that he can receive is disdain.  "], [7, "You get my upvote for an interesting theory. However, I believe he dislikes Toby because he's not apart of the team and threatens Michael's standing as the boss. Toby's job is literally to juxtapose Michael so he doesn't abuse his power. Employees can complain about each other to Toby, and he can resolve it, but if someone has a problem with Michael, they have to go to Toby. "], [5, "Off topic, but how did that show end without introducing Michael's mom and Jeff?"], [4, "It could also be because Micheal tries so hard to be funny and Toby says one joke during diversity day and everyone laughs. "], [3, "Didn't Michael show hatred for Toby before his divorce? I know Toby didn't get divorced right away in the show.\n\nAnd Michael doesn't just say he hates Toby because he's HR. He specifies *why* he dislikes HR. He claims it's their job to suck the fun out of everything. He shows the same hatred towards Hollie when he first meets her, and only starts liking her when she goes along with his \"fun\" ideas, something Toby never did."], [5, "I think that's part of it and it's a good observation too. We don't actually know anything about Michael's dad but we do know he isn't with his mother, whether that be through a divorce or death or something we just don't know.\n\nMichael clearly has a strenuous relationship with his family though, he hires his nephew to try and get his half-sister to like him (i don't recall them mentioning which parent they shared) and he hates his mother's husband (and still calls her the \"boyfriend\" even though he talks about the fact they got married), and the only times he talks to his mother on camera he's lying to her about his relationship with Jan and hangs up on her when he tries to lie about being engaged to Holly.\n\nLargely though i think Michael sees Toby as just the guy who tries to stop all of the fun he wants to have. I think at one stage Toby was a more active HR rep and done a lot more to curb Michael's behaviour but over time he lost his passion for HR. He only really steps in occasionally and i think that's just to keep up appearances.\n\nToby does annoy people though, i'm not sure why exactly but he seemingly has the worst timing. There's one such time when Michael tells Jim that he's seeing Pam's mother and Jim is telling him to not tell Pam but Toby walks in on the middle of the conversation to talk to Jim and Jim shouts at him. It's a funny moment actually because Michael yells \"idiot\" over the top of Jim.\n\nYour theory though OP is a good one, i think it's one of the things that certainly can be attributed to the problem though rather than it being a larger part of it."], [3, "No, no, no, no. It's so much simpler than that,  and Michael even says it numerous times. Michael hates Toby because he's with HR. Toby's job is to make sure nothing that can get the company in trouble happens in the office. That flies in the face of Michael's often times inappropriate and risque style of management. Michael does something against the rules, Toby reminds him he shouldn't, causing Michael to hate him for no reason other than his particular job.\n\nAs Michael even says, Toby's not a part of their \"family\" since he's technically corporates eyes in Scranton. This is why he hates Holly at first. He sees her as \"the female Toby\" and writes her off until he realizes she not only has a similar sense of humor to him, but that she could potentially be his girlfriend.\n\n \nI really don't think it's any deeper than that. They have the typical manager/HR relationship, but turned up to ten because Michael is bonkers at times. I'm surprised so many people came to different conclusions because I thought they hit us over the head with this one.\n\n\n\n"], [2, "Interesting... "], [2, "Wow, I love it!"], [2, "Multiple people come down on Toby though, not just Michael. \n\nStaying in the context of Michael and Toby's relationship though, I'd say that both have inferiority complexes and they see it in each other.

One thing we know about the office prior to the show starting is that Michael was best friends with Todd Packer. Now Packer is pretty much a jerk who pulls awkward and annoying pranks. But him and Michael got along probably because they were the two social outcasts of the office. Eventually Michael was promoted to Branch Manager and Packer became the traveling salesman. My theory is that Packer pulled some prank or said something so outrageous that he got in trouble with HR and Toby reprimanded him. This forced Packer to be a traveling salesman and no longer work in the Office proper because his behavior was too disruptive.

", "id": "dam8qji"}, {"comment": "Jim knows Toby has always liked Pam though, he just never had the position to do something 'about it'.", "id": "damo9zb"}], [{"comment": "I'm gonna chime in with my own theory here, because that seems to be the thing to do in this thread.   Michael hates Toby because Toby has no distinct/cultivated personality.  \n\nMichael's understanding of the world is shown to be informed broadly by generic stereotypes and broad generalizations.   Mostly he interacts with people through the lens of the stuff that you'd see on old TV sitcoms or from a comedy routine (almost like Abed from community in this sense - but more internalized) because he's socially phobic and can't understand how to interact with people except through a rigid (albiet typically not serious) set of predefined rules with the expectation that it'll somehow make people like him.  This expectation is derived from the fact that (as he says) \"comedy makes people laugh, and people really love to laugh\" - and for the fact that he is [desperate for friendship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxzC25lAkqI)\n\nSo, for example, when he interacts with Oscar he doesn't really interact with what Oscar is saying or doing, but rather with the predfined expection of what a Latino/gay man might do/say in a comedy routine.  The same thing goes for Jim, who he sees as the popular guy (despite the fact that Jim is kinda an asshole, and almost everyone in the office is mostly unimpressed by him) and thus Michael looks to him for Validation.  I think this comedy archetype framing is most obvious with Kelly Kapoor, who he'll ocassionally treat like an India-born immigrant rather than someone who's lived in America all her life.  An Indian-American daughter of immigrants does not fit into a comedy sketch anywhere near as well as a Indian immigrant would, so he chooses to interact with the version of her that fits what he expects people to find funny, despite its incongruity with reality.\n\nSo where does Toby fit into all of this?  Well, Michael is hardly the only person to point out that Toby is a bit dry of personality.  Jim, Ryan, and even Pam all reference it at some point, and his other interactions with other characters show that they'd rather not be around him simply because of how dry he can be (the exception to this is the fancy lunch club).  I know the whole \"Toby is the Stanton Strangler\" theory is fun, but if you look at the running gag about his obsession, and what it's actually implying...he's talking about it because the only thing interesting about him was that he served on a jury for some half-famous case that most people forgot about.   He's literally trying to milk it for all it's worth, because otherwise people find him incredibly dull.\n\nSo while this is somewhat expected and not usually a reason to hate someone, for Michael it is.   Don't forget, his entire social framework is determined by making comedic generalizations about people in an attempt to make them laugh, so that they'll like him.  But he can't do this with Toby.  There's nothing there to poke fun at, because there's nothing really there at all.   He's not fun, he's not funny, and nothing about him can even be construed to be funny (as is the case with characters like Oscar and Stanley, who are also both incredibly dull - but at least have stereotypes that Michael can frame them in to spice them up, and make them more comedically relevant).   So Michael hates Toby because he can't functionally relate to him in any way.\n\nIf you need any more evidence to support this theory, take a look at his interactions with all the other characters:\n\nThe charaters he tends to generally dislike are (in order of most to least) Phillys, Merridith, Gabe, and Angela.   The one commonality between these characters is that they all have \"weak\" (or subtle) personalities with no distinguishing traits that he can latch onto for the sake of his comedy routine.  When he does show appreciation for a character like Phillys, it's never in a comedic sense.  He's always casting her as a \"venerable old lady\" despite the fact that they're literally the same age - he wants to fit her into some mold that television tells him that people will like/relate to, so he works with what he can.\n\nNow granted, this isn't all there is to Michael Scott - obviously his relationship with Ryan, Dwight, Jim, and Pam are shown to be more complex - and this is because the writers want to make it clear that he is not LIMITED by design, but rather self-limited in this regard.  In fact, much of Michael Scott's conflict comes from this conflict between what his self-limitations and his real feelings (like, for example, the entire Jan arch). When he actually gets to know someone, and they make it inside his weird little bubble, he's shown to be able to have a real relationship with them even if that relationship is (as is the case with Ryan) simply to reject the easy generalization, and substitute it with his own real understanding of their person.  But for a charcter like Toby, who never makes it past the first layer, all that he can receive is disdain.  ", "id": "damismo"}, {"comment": "I like your points on how he relates to other people, but I don't think being \"bland\" is enough to inspire the total disdain we see.

He only really steps in occasionally and i think that's just to keep up appearances.\n\nToby does annoy people though, i'm not sure why exactly but he seemingly has the worst timing.

They could usually get them down pretty low because they saw it as free advertising. Then they would list the price on the show as the **full** retail price and many times, a lot higher. Bob saw to that. That *high* price is what went down on the show's tax write-off sheet. So the difference of what they paid and what they wrote off went to paying off Bob's debt to the producers.

First, it sees if the force is being caused by a conscious actor or not. If not, it will move. There's no \"worthiness\" to be judged. Second, if there is a conscious actor causing the force, it judges that conscious actor's intent, character, and more in an overall metric we call \"worthiness\". If the conscious actor initiating the force is judged to be \"worthy\", Mjolnir will allow itself to be wielded. \n\nYou could think of it as a computer program. Thor himself says Asgardian magic is really just super-advanced technology, and in Dr. Strange we learned that the MCU's magic is really closer hacking the universe's source code than it is to our traditional understanding of magic. \n\nIn fact, if we extrapolate from the idea that Mjolnir is actually a computer program, at what point must we consider it sentient? I've never seen Mjolnir's worthiness principle be used against it or Thor via a loophole (e.g., think back to S1E9 of Westworld, when Angela figures out [a way to kill the Man In Black](#spoiler) without violating her prime directive, via [horse-noose](#spoiler) ). This suggests that Mjolnir's worthiness-calculator is more than a simple binary judgement. It is able to see intent, history, and perhaps even look down the butterfly-effect chain to see who is truly asking it to perform an action. If Thanos somehow set off a series of events that required Thor to unknowingly use Mjolnir to some end that benefited him, perhaps Mjolnir would stop and refuse to allow itself to be wielded. Wouldn't THAT be interesting? If Mjolnir is capable of this, at what point do we consider it an AI? If it is not AI, and is a simple computer program calculating different forces acting against it like gravity, velocity, and worthiness, does this suggest that \"worthiness\" is a physical law within the MCU?\n\nBut I digress. \n\nIt has nothing to do with whether or not the wielder is worthy, it has do with whether or not Mjolnir is allowing itself to be wielded, which it determines based on the wielder's worthiness. Semantics, maybe, but it creates important distinctions when it comes to machines and physics. (That doesn't fit as nicely on a hammer, tho, hence the inscription.)\n\nCan an elevator or other simple machines \"lift\" the hammer? Obviously. Does that mean they're \"worthy\"? No, the elevator isn't doing any \"wielding\" \u2014 only a conscious actor can do that. \n\nI would say that Vision is absolutely wielding Mjolnir in that moment. I would also say Mjolnir judges him to be worthy. The argument could be made that the Mind Stone presented a unique case to Mjolnir and either was abundantly worthy, or was such an outlier that Mjolnir glitches out. The argument could also be made that Vision's previous life as JARVIS was judged to be worthy: selfless service, sacrifice for the greater good, kind overall. (But then again, he was programmed to be a selfless servant. How could that be judged to be \"worthy\"? I don't know!)\n\nThe most interesting use case of Mjolnir, to me, is when it was stuck in orbit around Earth. I forget the story, unfortunately, but it was entirely being manipulated by Earth's gravity. \n\nDoes that mean the Earth is \"worthy\"? It didn't come to a rest on a table, but it wasn't being used by a hero... either Earth is \"worthy\", or there's more to Mjolnir than \"being moved/not being moved\".\n\nAnyway, great post.

I think so. It's still canon to me that the hammer knows the difference between being used as a weapon and being picked up, and that's the best explanation I got for it.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Now that I think about it, wasn't Stan Lee trying to move it with a truck?

First, it sees if the force is being caused by a conscious actor or not. If not, it will move. There's no \"worthiness\" to be judged. Second, if there is a conscious actor causing the force, it judges that conscious actor's intent, character, and more in an overall metric we call \"worthiness\". If the conscious actor initiating the force is judged to be \"worthy\", Mjolnir will allow itself to be wielded. \n\nYou could think of it as a computer program. Thor himself says Asgardian magic is really just super-advanced technology, and in Dr. Strange we learned that the MCU's magic is really closer hacking the universe's source code than it is to our traditional understanding of magic. \n\nIn fact, if we extrapolate from the idea that Mjolnir is actually a computer program, at what point must we consider it sentient? I've never seen Mjolnir's worthiness principle be used against it or Thor via a loophole (e.g., think back to S1E9 of Westworld, when Angela figures out [a way to kill the Man In Black](#spoiler) without violating her prime directive, via [horse-noose](#spoiler) ). This suggests that Mjolnir's worthiness-calculator is more than a simple binary judgement. It is able to see intent, history, and perhaps even look down the butterfly-effect chain to see who is truly asking it to perform an action. If Thanos somehow set off a series of events that required Thor to unknowingly use Mjolnir to some end that benefited him, perhaps Mjolnir would stop and refuse to allow itself to be wielded. Wouldn't THAT be interesting? If Mjolnir is capable of this, at what point do we consider it an AI? If it is not AI, and is a simple computer program calculating different forces acting against it like gravity, velocity, and worthiness, does this suggest that \"worthiness\" is a physical law within the MCU?\n\nBut I digress. \n\nIt has nothing to do with whether or not the wielder is worthy, it has do with whether or not Mjolnir is allowing itself to be wielded, which it determines based on the wielder's worthiness. Semantics, maybe, but it creates important distinctions when it comes to machines and physics. (That doesn't fit as nicely on a hammer, tho, hence the inscription.)\n\nCan an elevator or other simple machines \"lift\" the hammer? Obviously. Does that mean they're \"worthy\"? No, the elevator isn't doing any \"wielding\" \u2014 only a conscious actor can do that. \n\nI would say that Vision is absolutely wielding Mjolnir in that moment. I would also say Mjolnir judges him to be worthy. The argument could be made that the Mind Stone presented a unique case to Mjolnir and either was abundantly worthy, or was such an outlier that Mjolnir glitches out. The argument could also be made that Vision's previous life as JARVIS was judged to be worthy: selfless service, sacrifice for the greater good, kind overall. (But then again, he was programmed to be a selfless servant. How could that be judged to be \"worthy\"? I don't know!)\n\nThe most interesting use case of Mjolnir, to me, is when it was stuck in orbit around Earth. I forget the story, unfortunately, but it was entirely being manipulated by Earth's gravity. \n\nDoes that mean the Earth is \"worthy\"? It didn't come to a rest on a table, but it wasn't being used by a hero... either Earth is \"worthy\", or there's more to Mjolnir than \"being moved/not being moved\".\n\nAnyway, great post.

They could have chosen Halo, Starcraft, Battlefield 1942, CounterStrike, Quake Arena and the story could have been nearly the same. Even more recent with their Freemium episode, the subject matter was very clear, but they didn't focus purely on one certain game (rather a whole subgenre within the industry). \n\nI still like the show, but my complaint is that they don't seem to be developing the characters as much any more favoring seeing how the characters respond to whatever people are reacting to recently.

[From the Psychopathy wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy):\n\n> The triarchic model, formulated by Christopher J. Patrick et al., suggests that different conceptions of psychopathy emphasize three observable characteristics to varying degrees. Analyses have been made with respect to the applicability of measurement tools such as the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL, PCL-R) and Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) to this model.[1][2]\n\n> Boldness. Low fear including stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, and high self-confidence and social assertiveness. The PCL-R measures this relatively poorly and mainly through Facet 1 of Factor 1. Similar to PPI Fearless dominance. May correspond to differences in the amygdala and other neurological systems associated with fear.[1][2]\n\nArcher has absolutely no fear of death (unless it's in the form of alligators, crocodiles, or brain aneurysms) and is convinced that no matter what he does, it'll all just kind of work out for him. \n\n> Disinhibition. Poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight, lacking affect and urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints. Similar to PCL-R Factor 2 and PPI Impulsive antisociality. May correspond to impairments in frontal lobe systems that are involved in such control.[1][2]\n\nRemember when he crashed the space shuttle at the last second? Poor impulse control is sort of Archer's defining trait.\n\n> Meanness. Lacking empathy and close attachments with others, disdain of close attachments, use of cruelty to gain empowerment, exploitative tendencies, defiance of authority, and destructive excitement seeking. The PCL-R in general is related to this but in particular some elements in Factor 1. Similar to PPI Coldheartedness but also includes elements of subscales in Impulsive antisociality.[1][2]\n\nObviously Archer is a dick to his friends, but most people aren't his friends and he's much worse to them. We know his love life has been described as 'luring girls up to his apartment' and he frequently forgets their names afterwards. He's also in a job where he does two things: spy and kill. He's a terrible spy, but he's also ISIS's best agent. Archer can straight up murder dozens of people without even paying attention.\n\n> A study by Farrington of a sample of London males followed between age 8 and 48 included studying which factors scored 10 or more on the PCL:SV at age 48. The strongest factors included having a convicted parent, **being physically neglected**, **low involvement of the father with the boy**, low family income, and coming from a disrupted family. Other significant factors included **poor supervision**, **harsh discipline**, large family size, delinquent sibling, young mother, depressed mother, low social class, and poor housing.[91] There has also been association between psychopathy and **detrimental treatment by peers**.[92] However, it is difficult to determine the extent of an environmental influence on the development of psychopathy because of **evidence of its strong heritability**.[93]\n\nWhile Archer's childhood doesn't have all the factors associated with psychopathy, it does have quite a few. Psychopathy is strongly genetic, and Mallory likewise displays many signs of psychopathic tendencies.\n\n> Psychopathy is also associated with substance use disorders.[27][140][142][144][145]\n\n[This is the first image result when you google Archer](http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/styles/tout_image_612x380/public/i/2014/03/19/EW-ARCHER-WALLPAPER_612x380_0.jpg?itok=qVP62ZEW)\n\n[This is the second](http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/styles/tout_image_612x380/public/i/2016/03/24/archer_0.jpg?itok=ocAPtRPu)\n"], [18, "Archer doesn't have autism, he has trauma and an anxiety disorder."], [15, "But how does Tommy Westphall fit into all of this?"], [13, "After all, his best friend was Lucas Troy and he was a massive dick just like Archer"], [9, "Being bullied probably doesn't help either"], [9, "Just want to point out if you think Fight Club is about being Bros you might want to rematch it."], [6, "I swear, I had something for this."], [3, "I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

Patrick et al., suggests that different conceptions of psychopathy emphasize three observable characteristics to varying degrees. Analyses have been made with respect to the applicability of measurement tools such as the Psychopathy Checklist (PCL, PCL-R) and Psychopathic Personality Inventory (PPI) to this model.[1][2]\n\n> Boldness. Low fear including stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, and high self-confidence and social assertiveness. The PCL-R measures this relatively poorly and mainly through Facet 1 of Factor 1. Similar to PPI Fearless dominance. May correspond to differences in the amygdala and other neurological systems associated with fear.[1][2]\n\nArcher has absolutely no fear of death (unless it's in the form of alligators, crocodiles, or brain aneurysms) and is convinced that no matter what he does, it'll all just kind of work out for him. \n\n> Disinhibition. Poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight, lacking affect and urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints. Similar to PCL-R Factor 2 and PPI Impulsive antisociality. May correspond to impairments in frontal lobe systems that are involved in such control.[1][2]\n\nRemember when he crashed the space shuttle at the last second? Poor impulse control is sort of Archer's defining trait.\n\n> Meanness. Lacking empathy and close attachments with others, disdain of close attachments, use of cruelty to gain empowerment, exploitative tendencies, defiance of authority, and destructive excitement seeking. The PCL-R in general is related to this but in particular some elements in Factor 1. Similar to PPI Coldheartedness but also includes elements of subscales in Impulsive antisociality.[1][2]\n\nObviously Archer is a dick to his friends, but most people aren't his friends and he's much worse to them. We know his love life has been described as 'luring girls up to his apartment' and he frequently forgets their names afterwards. He's also in a job where he does two things: spy and kill. He's a terrible spy, but he's also ISIS's best agent. Archer can straight up murder dozens of people without even paying attention.\n\n> A study by Farrington of a sample of London males followed between age 8 and 48 included studying which factors scored 10 or more on the PCL:SV at age 48. The strongest factors included having a convicted parent, **being physically neglected**, **low involvement of the father with the boy**, low family income, and coming from a disrupted family. Other significant factors included **poor supervision**, **harsh discipline**, large family size, delinquent sibling, young mother, depressed mother, low social class, and poor housing.[91] There has also been association between psychopathy and **detrimental treatment by peers**.[92] However, it is difficult to determine the extent of an environmental influence on the development of psychopathy because of **evidence of its strong heritability**.[93]\n\nWhile Archer's childhood doesn't have all the factors associated with psychopathy, it does have quite a few. Psychopathy is strongly genetic, and Mallory likewise displays many signs of psychopathic tendencies.\n\n> Psychopathy is also associated with substance use disorders.[27][140][142][144][145]\n\n[This is the first image result when you google Archer](http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/styles/tout_image_612x380/public/i/2014/03/19/EW-ARCHER-WALLPAPER_612x380_0.jpg?itok=qVP62ZEW)\n\n[This is the second](http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/styles/tout_image_612x380/public/i/2016/03/24/archer_0.jpg?itok=ocAPtRPu)\n", "id": "d7wkial"}, {"comment": "While you've got good evidence, Archer appears to be capable of love, and psychopaths aren't.

There is a drug connection but it's not that big.\n\nOn the first episodes of the cartoons, Scooby Doo only really talked to Shaggy and always gesticulated when speaking with the other characters. There's also the fact that both Shaggy and Scooby Doo were always hungry. That's kinda expected from the dog as he's a Great Dane, but not from that skinny dude.

The Mystery Machine was probably his hippie van, as there isn't much reason for Shaggy to be with the group since he's not interested in finding the monsters.\n\nThey change some of it later to make it less \"in the face\" that Shaggy is a pot head, like Scooby Doo talking to everyone, toned down violence, etc.\n\nThe series were meant to entertain teenagers and young adults so it depicted high school stereotypes of the time, like the jock, the yuppie, the nerd, the hippie and the obligatory pet that every cartoon was probably required to have. It always followed the formula of the characters investigating a supposed paranormal occurrency, Freddy trying to come up with a Rube Goldberg trap or sending the others away as he finds a secluded place to be with Daphne, Velma losing her glasses and being oblivious to the monster, Shaggy looking for food and to avoid looking for the monster, they capturing the monster at the end and realizing it was a rust of some kind, etc.\n\nIt seems that each character, apart from Shaggy and Scooby Doo, has some interest into solving these cases, to become popular or just out of curiosity. It had a nice skeptic mood for a 80's cartoon as every case ended up with some explanation showing that everything paranormal was just a trick. They kinda changed it later and it sucks. :P\n\nThe fact that they don't charge for their services is more because of a trope where heroes don't charge for their good deeds. Superman would look like an asshole if he sent a bill to everyone he saved, right? The problem is that the Scooby Doo gang are not super heroes, they're private paranormal investigators, and not charging is stupid.

You see, after \"the war\" (it isn't important which one, but the Civil War would be appropriate), a general returns to his old family estate.  Some of the troops who served with him were from the nearby town.  They'd always call their former leader general, partly out of habit, partly out of respect.  Over the decades, they all grow older.  The general retires, and leaves running the estate to his son.  By this time, the retired soldiers are getting on in years, and a few are getting more than a bit senile.  By this time, the general's son looks more like what they remember the general looking like than the old man the general became, so some take to calling the son general.\n\nNow, this is the South.  Etiquette is important.  It is highly improper to correct one's elders, especially respected members of the community, honored veterans, especially if they are also sometimes violent drunks.  So, the old guys called the son general, and no one corrects them.  To keep up the act, everyone else calls him general too.  By the time the real general, and the old guys have passed on, the habit has stuck.  Half the people calling the son general don't even know that he's never been a general.\n\nWell, the original general's grandson, raised on stories of his grandpa's legacy joins the military, and attains the rank of colonel before retiring and taking over the estate.  He's not a general, but people have seen him in uniform, and just continue the tradition of calling the owner of the estate general.

He was under the impression that the more people tap into the dark side, the more stretched out this power becomes, thus making it less potent for everyone. Two Sith, a master and an apprentice, was the ultimate way to maximize the potential of the dark side whilst still securing the future of the sith.\n\nAnother thing is that Kylo can't be a sith because there was no sith to teach him. This doesn't have to be the case. There's these things called holocrons, which are very advanced recording devices that can be used to record lessons for future generations of force sensitives. The usage of these devices was relatively widespread, but limited to force sensitives.

And while it's true, he does not consider himself to be a member of the Sith order, much like Ahsoka doesn't consider herself to be a Jedi, their training and thus their actions in both cases follows those order's teachings rather closely.  If I recall correctly, in the Rebels season finale, Maul even says a piece of the Sith Code... something about power and his chains being broken.  So, like I assume Ahsoka passed on some knowledge to Ezra, I imagine it's entirely possible for Maul to pass on Sith teachings and secrets to an apprentice, should he have one... and he's seeking one it seems, since he tried to make Ezra his apprentice.  So it's entirely possible that during the Episode 7 era, somewhere out there is a Dark Sider following the basic tenets of the Sith, perhaps even Maul himself since I don't think we know the lifespan of his species.  And if Maul survives through Episode 6, it's also possible he reclaims his Darth title and the mantle of Sith Lord and re-founds the order, so there may indeed be actual Sith running around the galaxy..

There's just a few things I want to correct: The rule of 2 hasn't always been there. It was introduced by Darth Bane in order to keep the dark side of the force strong. He was under the impression that the more people tap into the dark side, the more stretched out this power becomes, thus making it less potent for everyone. Two Sith, a master and an apprentice, was the ultimate way to maximize the potential of the dark side whilst still securing the future of the sith.\n\nAnother thing is that Kylo can't be a sith because there was no sith to teach him. This doesn't have to be the case. There's these things called holocrons, which are very advanced recording devices that can be used to record lessons for future generations of force sensitives. The usage of these devices was relatively widespread, but limited to force sensitives.

With a society of power-hungry Sith, there will be rivalries and internal conflict, resulting in a less unified empire. Sith Lords who are equals, fighting each other with private armies and appearances, jockeying for prestige and internal position rather than defeating the true enemy, Jedi and the republic.\n\nWith the rule of two, you have one master, one appearance. The apprentice serves the master until he grows strong enough to defeat him, replacing him as master. It makes things simpler. The apprentice only has to worry about getting stronger than the master, and the master only has to worry about staying stronger than the apprentice, rather than dozens of rivals, subordinates and superiors.\n\nWith a society of Sith, inter-Sith conflicts will take armies of soldiers, droids and low ranking Sith. With the rule of two, with an apprentice and master that will often be close, it gives apprentice the chance to face his master in combat without needless waste of resources.\n\nAlso, having only one of each, means you always get the strongest become master.

And while it's true, he does not consider himself to be a member of the Sith order, much like Ahsoka doesn't consider herself to be a Jedi, their training and thus their actions in both cases follows those order's teachings rather closely.  If I recall correctly, in the Rebels season finale, Maul even says a piece of the Sith Code... something about power and his chains being broken.  So, like I assume Ahsoka passed on some knowledge to Ezra, I imagine it's entirely possible for Maul to pass on Sith teachings and secrets to an apprentice, should he have one... and he's seeking one it seems, since he tried to make Ezra his apprentice.  So it's entirely possible that during the Episode 7 era, somewhere out there is a Dark Sider following the basic tenets of the Sith, perhaps even Maul himself since I don't think we know the lifespan of his species.  And if Maul survives through Episode 6, it's also possible he reclaims his Darth title and the mantle of Sith Lord and re-founds the order, so there may indeed be actual Sith running around the galaxy..

The tail is sometimes struck by lightning in this pose.\n\nThis implies that it is not at all uncommon for a Pikachu to be struck by lightning. In addition, Professor Oak says in the first episode that there is a problem with Pikachu, but never goes into detail. I would say it is probably more likely that Pikachu just has high IVs  and is thereby naturally stronger than most. \n\nIn addition, Pikachu was given to a very inexperienced and inept trainer. Given how disobedient Pikachu was in the beginning and that he wasn't actually \"captured\" by Ash, it would be reasonable to assume Pikachu may have even been a higher level than we assumed in the beginning. Pikachu just didn't have any reason to respect Ash until Ash showed his own loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from the Spearows. Consider as well that even after Ash caught Primeape, Primeape was still hostile and disobedient until Ash, again, acted selflessly to prove his dedication to him. And when Charmander evolved, what happened? Charmeleon immediately was disobedient and continued to be so after evolving to Charizard. What caused Charizard to become obedient again though? Was it because Ash managed to win that special Gym badge? Did Ash prove himself to be a strong and capable trainer? Nope, he stayed up all night watching over Charizard after it had become frozen. \n\nNotice a trend? Ash is arguably a horribly weak trainer with strong Pokemon during the Indigo League. He doesn't earn respect by being strong, he earns it by being dedicated and caring. So, Pikachu was probably just a high enough level to appear stronger than it should have given the assumption would have been that it was a low level given its trainer's experience. Then, the power up Pikachu got from Brock's father was probably also a decent boost to his power. \n\nSo, I would say that what makes Pikachu so strong would be a combination of being a higher level, high IVs, Pika Power-Up from Brock's dad, and a pretty strong bond with Ash. The lightning was likely irrelevant in Pikachu's lasting power and only was really relevant, if at all, for that single incident.

Likely that overloaded pikachu an \"permanently increase his electrical storage ability\"\n\nPikachu used all the power from the lightning bolt to fend off the spearow. So over time his storage ability would have gone back down to normal. \n\nExcept at the pokecenter he was then fully charged to his new increased capacity by Misty's bike and the other pikachu.\n\nThen you get to the hydro electric charging done in Pewter at the suggestion of Brock's father. \n\nSo you have a specially bred pikachu, who had his storage capacity increased by a bolt of lightning, and then had that new maximum maintained by several events over a short period of time. This would cause a temporary power increase to become a permanent one.\n\nSo a foreign Pichu that was specifically bred to know a powerful move. Was then raised by a world renowned Pokemon Professor.

The tail is sometimes struck by lightning in this pose.\n\nThis implies that it is not at all uncommon for a Pikachu to be struck by lightning. In addition, Professor Oak says in the first episode that there is a problem with Pikachu, but never goes into detail. I would say it is probably more likely that Pikachu just has high IVs  and is thereby naturally stronger than most. \n\nIn addition, Pikachu was given to a very inexperienced and inept trainer. Given how disobedient Pikachu was in the beginning and that he wasn't actually \"captured\" by Ash, it would be reasonable to assume Pikachu may have even been a higher level than we assumed in the beginning. Pikachu just didn't have any reason to respect Ash until Ash showed his own loyalty to Pikachu by protecting him from the Spearows. Consider as well that even after Ash caught Primeape, Primeape was still hostile and disobedient until Ash, again, acted selflessly to prove his dedication to him. And when Charmander evolved, what happened? Charmeleon immediately was disobedient and continued to be so after evolving to Charizard. What caused Charizard to become obedient again though? Was it because Ash managed to win that special Gym badge? Did Ash prove himself to be a strong and capable trainer? Nope, he stayed up all night watching over Charizard after it had become frozen. \n\nNotice a trend? Ash is arguably a horribly weak trainer with strong Pokemon during the Indigo League. He doesn't earn respect by being strong, he earns it by being dedicated and caring. So, Pikachu was probably just a high enough level to appear stronger than it should have given the assumption would have been that it was a low level given its trainer's experience. Then, the power up Pikachu got from Brock's father was probably also a decent boost to his power. \n\nSo, I would say that what makes Pikachu so strong would be a combination of being a higher level, high IVs, Pika Power-Up from Brock's dad, and a pretty strong bond with Ash. The lightning was likely irrelevant in Pikachu's lasting power and only was really relevant, if at all, for that single incident. ", "id": "d5pokzj"}, {"comment": "There's a difference between his tail getting struck and a full on lightning strike. Electricity always takes the shortest path to ground, so when his tail is struck it just goes through his tail, to his feet, then ground. When he jumps in the air and is struck there's no way for Pikachu to ground it so it just bottles up inside him until he can't hold it, and it just explodes.", "id": "d5q0elp"}, {"comment": "> Electricity always takes the shortest path to ground\n\nLightning always takes the *path of least resistance*. If lightning always took the shortest path, it would like like straight beams rather than jagged bolts.\n\n> When he jumps in the air and is struck there's no way for Pikachu to ground it so it just bottles up inside him\n\nWhen lightning strikes an object mid air, it continues through that target to its target, normally because that object just happened to get in the way. However, while this is likely not the case with Pikachu, it is also just as likely that it is not being \"bottled up.\" It is actually likely just the opposite.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the current of electricity in lightning always flows from negative to positive. As such, when a negatively charged CG lightning strike happens, the return stroke is the flow of electrons from the negative charge in the clouds to the positive charge in the ground, with a positively charged CG lightning stroke being the opposite. A few common properties involved with positive lightning strikes is that they are commonly the dominate type of strikes in dissipating storms and usually consist of a single stroke. \n\nIf you watch the scene with the Spearows, you will notice both of these things. The return stroke which hits Pikachu is a single stroke and is followed by the storm breaking up and disappearing. This implies that Pikachu holds a negative charge (at least in this instance). So, when the lightning strike occurs, the flow of electrons is likely coming out of Pikachu and flowing up to the clouds. This combined with his own release of a charge created the huge explosion of energy we see in the episode.\n\nNotice as well that not only is Pikachu physically exhausted after this.

He seems constantly in conflict with himself, he's disturbed, and don't really know what to think.

They have more to learn than he does, although he still has more to learn. They all have great innate ability though. \n\nI think this theory does go well with the theory that Kylo and Rey are siblings. Rey will be more in line with Luke and will make Kylo even more jealous/resentful."], [1, "My first thing is did Luke ever learn to make a light Saber himself cuz he was taught later and was given an Anakins sword.  Second is that Anakins ghost shows up beside obi wan at the end of the sixth correct so it's not that he was unavailable It's more like he was brought back to the light side in the end."], [1, "> As for why Luke himself didn't stop Kylo, well, that is probably for a different theory.\n\nno it is not, you kind of already explained it. Luke left behind light saber training and battle. you could say that is because he knows that jedis should not be armed soldiers for galactic battles. In return of the jedi he defeated the emperor because he chooses not to fight by switching off his weapon (in my opinion this decision is the true return of the jedi).\n\nnow Luke didn't fight Kylo because this would not be the way of the jedi or the way he chose for the jedi.\n\nI guess in episode 8 we will see how Luke is really thinking about lightsaber battles."], [1, "Goes with my, no one knows how to use a light saber theory, maybe one day I'll see the wrist flicking that I've imagined in my head."], [1, "Kylo is a title.

Especially since it explains why the untrained Rey seemed so so much more powerful than Kylo Ren, who has both light side and dark side training. She wasn't that powerful, she was just much better than mediocre Kylo Ren.\n\nOn a side note, why did Han and Leia name their kid \"Ben Solo\"? Han barely met Obi-Wan and Leia seemed to know of him as a general, but not personally. Do they even meet in A New Hope?"], [1, "He didn't even do a single flip during the fight at the end."], [1, "I like it, but Kylo has shown that he's extremely capable of using the force -- he can read minds and stop a blaster bolt mid-air (both feats we haven't seen before).  I don't see him to be the struggling student type in the academy."], [1, "This is the most biased and unfunded thread if probably ever seen, Kylo's power and potential is almost unsurpassed bar Luke, Anakin, Leia and perhaps Sidious or Yoda. He mastered Telephatic Intrusion, has immense telekinetic defenses and is an almost unstoppable warrior on the battlefield, all according to the The Force Awakens Visual Guide. Meanwhile in terms of feats he's done everything he wanted to do except penetrating Rey's mind but take into account that Vader failed to do the same on Leia in A New Hope, is he mediocre to? \nNext the saber duel, he was mentally hindered from killing his father (novelization confirms this) and had just been shot by a bowcaster that destroyed First Order Stormtroopers (the novelization, jr novel, ... make continious note of how great his level of injury is) yet he still destroyed Finn the moment he unleashed his power on him (he was confirmed to be toying with Finn for the rest of the fight) while Finn is named as one of the best melee fighters of the First Order Stormtroopers (you know the supersoldiers). He even goes further down with pushing back Rey to the brink of defeat (who's named to have perfected certain quarterstaff moves and she handled a lightsaber as an extension of her own arm) only when Rey apparently has her \"channel the Force\" moment is she able to defeat him. Add to that the fact that in the novelization and junior novelization Kylo, after he gets disarmed by Rey, is blocking lightsaber blows with the Force, a feat almost unequaled besides the best of the best (e.g. Valkorion) while at the same time he had been bleeding out from the bowcaster wound, mentally unstable because of killing his father and hit by a lightsaber strike from Finn. No, Kylo Ren is everything but average, the fact that he could massacre all of Luke's students with only the help of 6 knights of Ren (who are inferior to him anyways since he's the master of them) only reinforces his prowess as a lightsaber combatant and Force warrior."], [1, "They purposely trained him wrong?

Snoke's capture of Ben Solo is what led to Leia and Han falling out, and from the sounds of their relationship, it's been a long time. Hell, the Falcon was gone for so long that Rey only knew of it as a myth, and I doubt that was while Han was fathering.\n\nI suspect, like the Jedi Order, Snoke got Ben before he was even a few years old. He managed to sway him over for years, only for him to fall totally to the Dark Side in his early teens. Snoke, not being a Sith nor caring about the Rule of Two, kept Ben in the dark for most of his force powers. As you mentioned, he is shitty with a lightsaber because General Snoke is either a weak force wielder or left him in the dark.\n\nI think Snoke, being clearly not a strong force user himself likely kept Ben held back so that he could have his Darth Vader like weapon without the fear of him turning on him."], [0, "I initially misread the post title as 'Kyle Katarn' and came here to complain.

Maybe, because of him not being the best jedi student, he went full dark side, but I really think that's a default choice: \"I'm not a good jedi? I must be a good sith\".  \r  \rAs someone else said, Yoda saw the future of the jedi order through love and friendship. Kylo had this. At least some. He was raised normally, had an education etc. Anakin went into the dark side because he was manipulated by a powerful sith lord who took advantage of his raw and powerful emotions, his inner conflicts between what he deeply wants and what the jedis teaches him, what they are.  \r  \rSo at the end, Kylo isn't evil, he's just trying to be bad. He seems constantly in conflict with himself, he's disturbed, and don't really know what to think. He isn't a good jedi because he's instable, maybe doesn't work enough or just don't believe in the order. But he isn't a good sith neither. A sith is supposed to use his emotions, but he doesn't use them, he just randomly let them burst without focus.

The Fortress of Solitude has supposedly been on earth since before humanity, but one of the capsules was open, meaning SOMEONE from the crew escaped--someone who, like Supes himself, would be nearly impossible to kill.  Someone who, conceivably, could have given rise to a whole generation of Kryptonians--or at least people who looked exactly like Kryptonians.  The race of super-men survived the early ages, but with time adapted to the planet and lost their powers--as we see Supes himself doing in the course of the movie.\n\nThis is why Superman (and the other Kryptonians) look so decidedly normal.  *They* don't look like humans, Humans look like them.  Supes isn't an alien at all--at least not aside from how Earth is a planet of aliens.\n\nIf you take the DCU to be roughly equivalent to the comics-verse, it's easy to take this a step further.  The universe is full of \"aliens\" that are basically humans/Kryptonians with colored skin, or forehead ridges, or little antenna sticking out of various parts--descendants of other Kryptonian colonies.\n\nNote that this isn't incompatible with your idea.  The Doomsday infestation could be what caused the middle to collapse out of the Kryptonian empire and left the colonies stranded to develop on their own."], [5, "I feel like you thought about this much more than Snyder, Goyer, and co.

But, if there is a natural birth(Doomsday) on Krypton, why would they fear it? If it is already neutralized by Red Sun and atmosphere? It could work simply as a rule and superstition. Plus, interestingly, Codex looks like a skull, and the skull is small.\n \nOff-topic, did they have FTL travel, I don't think so. Maybe Krypton is not even their homeworld, or original homeworld. For example, scout ships travel across space, they rebuild, Krypton that sent them died, colonists return."], [2, "As much as I hated Doomsday in the film, this is a solid theory"], [2, "That works - we saw the expansion of the Kryptonians in the explanation piece that Jor-El's simulacrum shows Kal-El  "], [2, "But there must be other red sun planets out there."], [2, "It says pretty much this on the Man of Steel Bluray regarding Doomsday: Bertron's Curse\n\nhttp://comicbook.com/blog/2013/11/09/man-of-steel-blu-ray-extras-hint-at-death-of-superman-wayne-enterprises/"], [2, "Personally I think it all ties back to the energy shortage. What ever resource they had originally used to make interstellar travel possible had been completely depleted by the time of MoS. It was only after mining the exotic phantom particles from their planet's core that interstellar travel became possible again.\n\nI might also add that the original kryptonian colonists might not have had the same abilities that the modern kryptonians had. It's possible that they only gained the ability to metabolize ambient radiation after turning towards genetically manipulating their species. Something which was made necessary by the diminishing resources on their planet. If this ability did exist withing the ancient kryptonians it was too a much smaller degree"], [2, "What I got from the colonists is more that they couldn't really survive for whatever reason once these places were krypto-formed . So maybe in the cinematic universe the kryptonite is a by-product of the kryptoformer , meaning as soon as they terraformed a place they end up dying. Also as people have pointed out they just react differently to our sun, not that their sun is hazardous to them.

Different versions of them, anyway.  The Fortress of Solitude has supposedly been on earth since before humanity, but one of the capsules was open, meaning SOMEONE from the crew escaped--someone who, like Supes himself, would be nearly impossible to kill.  Someone who, conceivably, could have given rise to a whole generation of Kryptonians--or at least people who looked exactly like Kryptonians.  The race of super-men survived the early ages, but with time adapted to the planet and lost their powers--as we see Supes himself doing in the course of the movie.\n\nThis is why Superman (and the other Kryptonians) look so decidedly normal.  *They* don't look like humans, Humans look like them.  Supes isn't an alien at all--at least not aside from how Earth is a planet of aliens.\n\nIf you take the DCU to be roughly equivalent to the comics-verse, it's easy to take this a step further.

Wouldn't Voldemort's killing curse just end Harry's life?\n\nExpelliarmus isn't strong enough to stop the killing curse and at this point, it wasn't the same as in the goblet of fire, where their wands shared the same core.\n\nSo if Harry did not have the elder wand's allegiance, Voldemort should have prevailed right? Or did I miss something?"], [107, "The Wand's allegiance isn't all about physical prowess, or even skill in dueling. Grindelwald still defeats Gregorovitch, just in a way the Wand hadn't witnessed before. Wands change their allegiance based on their perception of the wielder, right? I think we misunderstand what the Wand constitutes as \"besting.\" Assuming most of the masters of the Elder Wand thought its power/allegiance *only* changed through direct application of force (murder, etc.), Grindelwald showing up and heisting the Elder Wand was somehow more impressive than just knifing a dude in the alley.\n\nI think the Elder Wand changed its allegiance because Grindelwald was different from its past masters but still ambitious enough to seek the Wand. It wanted to see something different. \n\nIt didn't, because Grindelwald ended up being evil, so it changed hands to someone decidedly more chill."], [46, "Everyone tends to assume that the Elder Wand is \"the most / a most powerful object\". However, I don't think that's really the case, and it's just as ordinary as any other wand.\n\nI think the Elder Wand is more so the result of centuries of rumor, tall tales, and build-up about one wand in particular. Yet, in reality, the wand itself isn't really that \"powerful\" at all. Or, the Elder Wand only has the \"illusion\" of being powerful, because people have built up the story / legend of it so much over the years that they assume it *\"must\"* be powerful. \n\nIn some cases, the wizards who wielded the Elder Wand seemed to have a case of confirmation bias, or the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories (i.e., \"the wand defeated my enemies! Therefore, it *must* be the most powerful wand in the world!\").\n\nFrom taking a look at the wandlore presented on both Pottermore and in the books, each wand, based on the wood and core combination, paired with a certain witch or wizard, had its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThis also mirrors real-life, in which each individual has his / her own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Hermione is \"brilliant\", but not that great at DADA. On the other hand, Harry is amazing at DADA, but not as \"brilliant\" as Hermione. \n\nTheir wands also reflect their personalities, along with these areas. If anything, the wand seems to choose the witch / wizard that the particular wood-and-core combination most matches in these aspects. Therefore, the wand can be seen as a \"reflection\" of the witch / wizard themselves.\n\nFor example, Hermione's wand is vine, with a core of dragon heartstring. Dragon heartstring is the most \"powerful\" of the three cores Ollivander uses, but can be \"more volatile\". On the other hand, Harry has a wand of holly, with a core of phoenix feather. Phoenix feather wands \"take more time to master, but also have some of the most stunning displays of magic\".\n\nIf we adhere to Ollivander's claim about his \"three cores\" being \"the Supreme ones\" - dragon heartstring, unicorn hair, and phoenix feather - then the Elder Wand, which has a core of thestral tail hair, wouldn't even come close to being \"powerful\". \n\n> \"Early in my career, as I watched my wandmaker father wrestling with substandard wand core materials such as kelpie hair, I conceived the ambition to discover the finest cores and to work only with those when my time came to take over the family business. This I have done. \n\n> After much experimentation and research, I concluded that only three substances produce wands of the quality to which I am happy to give the illustrious name of Ollivander: unicorn hair, dragon heartstring and phoenix feather. \n\n> Each of these costly and rare materials has its own distinct properties. The following represents a short summary of my researches into each of the three Supreme Cores. \n\n> Readers should bear in mind that **each wand is the composite of its wood, its core and the experience and nature of its owner; that tendencies of each may counterbalance or outweigh the other**; so this can only be a very general overview of an immensely complex subject.\" - J.K. Rowling as Garrick Ollivander, [Pottermore](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-cores)\n\n-----------------\n\nLikewise, if the Elder Wand isn't really more powerful than any other wand, then disarming its owner would work to change its allegiance. This also happened when Harry \"won\" Draco's original wand (hawthorn with unicorn hair) by disarming him.\n\n> \"Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased, to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione's had done.\" - *Deathly Hallows*"], [32, "There is plenty of textual evidence to contradict you, particularly:\n\n>Harry saw Voldemort\u2019s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder  Wand fly high, dark  against the  sunrise, spinning across the  enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning  through the air toward **the master it would not kill**, who had come  to take full possession of it at last. \n\nThere's no reason to argue that stealing a wand doesn't constitute a defeat. Harry stole Draco's wand from him and it counted. I'm pretty sure the only prerequisite is that it has to be taken against the owner's will. \n\nPlus, the rules when it comes to wands aren't exactly concrete. The books establish that they're semi-sentient and pass their ownership pretty much as they will. Plus, Rowling has said before that the Elder Wand is unique in that is has no loyalty and only respects strength. Surely the Elder Wand would have a greater respect for Grindelwald's strength, a fledgling dark lord, over Gregorovitch's, a wandmaker?"], [28, "Good work OP. It sounds right and with just the little research I did, it holds up. If Gregorovitch was the \"owner\" of the wand and the wand is only passed on by killing the old wand holder, and Grindelwald doesn't kill him but steals the wand, it explains how Dumbledore was able to defeat Grindelwald even though Grindelwald had possession of the elder wand."], [9, "I disagree with theft being a cowardly act. Maybe it's just because I like heist movies, playing rogues in D&D, and stuff like the Gentleman Bastards series. All of these feature sly and intelligent thieves demonstrating their bravery by besting insurmountable odds to acquire the object of their pursuit. As a wand maker in possession of a massively powerful artifact, there is no doubt his home had layer upon layer of magical security. It's not like Grindlewald could've just faffed up to a window, smashed it and walked off with the wand."], [10, "Wasn't the original owner of his wand murdered in his sleep? I feel like that would be just as cowardly an act as stealing it(maybe more so since the victim can't come looking for their stolen property). "], [5, "Great theory, but I don't think it fully holds up, specifically your assumption that the wand only changes alliances to a more powerful wizard.\n\nThe books explain how the wand was passed from person to person even when the previous owners had their throats slit in their sleep iirc. Not about power."], [5, "I figured all wands could be won by any challenge to the owner for possession of the wand itself. That's why they could be won through spellwork, grappling, or as Grindewald proved picking the damn thing up and hot-footing it.\n\n That's why killing isn't necessary *and* why purchasing a wand gains its allegiance. Because you've proven that you value the wand more than the money, and the owner proved the opposite. Wands don't care who is the better wizard. They care who wants them more. \n\nAnd as two different trees can grow into a fused specimen (or maybe for this example two magical power adapters tangled together), two wands bound to one wizard will both be attuned to the same link between man and magic, which is why both are affected even if only one was taken without the owner's consent. You can't cut away one of the trees without severing the other, and you can't divert one thaumatic conduit without the other bending with it to the new wizard."], [3, "fun theory. i sent it to my gf, the big harry potter fan said this:\n\n\ninteresting but i disagree. the whole point of that part of the story of the 3 brothers was to show how the power hungry people thought the only way to win something off someone was to kill the owner. the wand demonstrates that it is more than a piece of wood by sensing that it has a new owner and thought grindelwald has bested gregorovitch. he has the wand so he did best him, he just didnt kill him which hasn\u2019t happened before but he demonstrates that that isn\u2019t necessary which allows malfoy to win the wand from dumbledore before snape kills him and harry to win the wand from malfoy by just grabbing it. humans are naturally violent and so the man in the pub in the 3 brothers story kills the original owner but thats not the only way to win a wand. the wand chooses the wizard, it doesn\u2019t just leave after death."], [3, "You say stealing is a cowardly action, but I would counter with this. Powerful can be taken in many ways here I believe. One would think the master of the wand would know to keep it safe not leave it lying around. So if someone steals it it's because they were smarter then the person who it \"belonged\" to. \n\nSo the wand changes allegiance to whom ever is smart (powerful) enough to take it. I like your theory but I think that in magic what is honorable and what isn't. \n\nPeople say that killing is bad for the soul, so when anyone kills shouldn't that mean that your soul is torn?

It ALWAYS wins DUELLS for the owner (but just magic duells performed WITH the wand).\n2. It switches its owner ONLY upon someone killing the owner.\n3.

By his/her firstborn child? or if he has no family by his bloodline?\nNO I believe it's simply who ever gets to touch it first AND fulfills rule 3 and in that case rule 2 has to get a new line for an ownerswitch.\n\nBack to the actuall problem starting at the duell between Harry and V.:\nSo if Voldemord were a rightfull and worthy owner of the Elderwand, he would have won the duell.\nHe didn't so he couldn't be the owner. So let's go back to Gregorowitsch as rightfull and worthy owner where the ownership were SUPPOSED to switch on Voldemord, because well its someone killing the Elderwands owner so he switches. WELL what if Voldemord wasn't a \"someone\" as in the ruleset.\nVoldemord body is a marionette animated by his Horcrux-Souls. So he might not be an actuall person who killed Gregorowitsch in witch case the ownership didn't switch to him.\n\nSo who is now the true Owner after Gregorowitsch was killed? well we apply the \"who ever touches first\" rule and so at the point of Gregorowitsch death the one who HOLD the Elderwand in that moment... and that is dumbledore but he is aready dead and lies in his grave burries with the wand, so its still ownerless. Who picks it up first... well Voldemord but still his unworthy animated body not actually \"someone\".\nBut eventually in the battle of Harry and him the wand gets into Harrys Hands and finally switches its ownership onto him."], [1, "I'm surprised nobody just chalked it up to plot convenience, haha."], [1, "you're assuming  Gegorovitch was a master.

However, I don't think that's really the case, and it's just as ordinary as any other wand.\n\nI think the Elder Wand is more so the result of centuries of rumor, tall tales, and build-up about one wand in particular. Yet, in reality, the wand itself isn't really that \"powerful\" at all. Or, the Elder Wand only has the \"illusion\" of being powerful, because people have built up the story / legend of it so much over the years that they assume it *\"must\"* be powerful. \n\nIn some cases, the wizards who wielded the Elder Wand seemed to have a case of confirmation bias, or the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories (i.e., \"the wand defeated my enemies! Therefore, it *must* be the most powerful wand in the world!\").\n\nFrom taking a look at the wandlore presented on both Pottermore and in the books, each wand, based on the wood and core combination, paired with a certain witch or wizard, had its own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThis also mirrors real-life, in which each individual has his / her own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Hermione is \"brilliant\", but not that great at DADA. On the other hand, Harry is amazing at DADA, but not as \"brilliant\" as Hermione. \n\nTheir wands also reflect their personalities, along with these areas. If anything, the wand seems to choose the witch / wizard that the particular wood-and-core combination most matches in these aspects. Therefore, the wand can be seen as a \"reflection\" of the witch / wizard themselves.\n\nFor example, Hermione's wand is vine, with a core of dragon heartstring. Dragon heartstring is the most \"powerful\" of the three cores Ollivander uses, but can be \"more volatile\". On the other hand, Harry has a wand of holly, with a core of phoenix feather. Phoenix feather wands \"take more time to master, but also have some of the most stunning displays of magic\".\n\nIf we adhere to Ollivander's claim about his \"three cores\" being \"the Supreme ones\" - dragon heartstring, unicorn hair, and phoenix feather - then the Elder Wand, which has a core of thestral tail hair, wouldn't even come close to being \"powerful\". \n\n> \"Early in my career, as I watched my wandmaker father wrestling with substandard wand core materials such as kelpie hair, I conceived the ambition to discover the finest cores and to work only with those when my time came to take over the family business. This I have done. \n\n> After much experimentation and research, I concluded that only three substances produce wands of the quality to which I am happy to give the illustrious name of Ollivander: unicorn hair, dragon heartstring and phoenix feather. \n\n> Each of these costly and rare materials has its own distinct properties. The following represents a short summary of my researches into each of the three Supreme Cores. \n\n> Readers should bear in mind that **each wand is the composite of its wood, its core and the experience and nature of its owner; that tendencies of each may counterbalance or outweigh the other**; so this can only be a very general overview of an immensely complex subject.\" - J.K. Rowling as Garrick Ollivander, [Pottermore](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-cores)\n\n-----------------\n\nLikewise, if the Elder Wand isn't really more powerful than any other wand, then disarming its owner would work to change its allegiance. This also happened when Harry \"won\" Draco's original wand (hawthorn with unicorn hair) by disarming him.\n\n> \"Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased, to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione's had done.\" - *Deathly Hallows*", "id": "d9k9mw0"}, {"comment": "I like the thought you put into that, and appreciate your views. This is a preliminary theory, though I haven't been able to find a contradiction within the books or within the ideas the book represents.\n\n You cant disregard the Elder wand as \"just an ordinary wand\" without disregarding the Resurrection stone, or the Invisibility Cloak. Both of those items were indeed imbibed with more magical quality than any other of their like. And seeing as the Elder Wand was able to properly mend Harry's wand when Ollivander himself could not, I would argue that it is indeed more powerful than any other wand. \n\nOne shouldn't accept that Ollivander is the end all-be all of wand makers too. Of course\n>\"you Britans set much store by Ollivander\"\n\nBut we hold him in such high regard because he is the most prevalent wandmaker in the story.  \n\n", "id": "d9kabnx"}, {"comment": "Thank you for your reply. You brought up some excellent points, which I wanted to address and clarify further.\n\nYou mention the Elder Wand as related to the Resurrection Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. However, within the books, it's most likely that each one was created by a separate Peverell brother, as opposed to being created together. Due to this, each object would have different strengths and weaknesses as well.\n\nLikewise, unlike magical object creation of a different nature, wandlore seems to be a much more common, and practiced, art. For example, based on [my analysis of Salazar Slytherin's wand](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/4zek3x/i_uncovered_some_details_about_salazar_slytherins/) [from Pottermore], it is most likely that Slytherin crafted his own wand for himself. This is also likely true for Antioch Peverell, said to be the \"creator\" of the Elder Wand.\n\nLikely, centuries ago, it was not uncommon at all for people to just make their own wands, as opposed to buying them from a wand-maker. Due to this, I'd wager it was much easier to create a wand than, say, a stone that can show you the impressions or past imprints of dead individuals, or charms on a cloak that can last for centuries. \n\nThe two of the latter stand out because, in-universe, they require much more advanced (and powerful) magic, spells, and even spell-invention, which is very dangerous in itself. While \"anyone\" could likely craft a wand, it took two men of extraordinarily powerful magic, talent, skill, and experience to create the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility.\n\nIn fact, the only magic that really compares are the enchantments of the Hogwarts founders on Hogwarts itself.\n\nI find it quite possible that Antioch, while being the \"elder\" brother of the three, was not as powerful, nor skilled or talented, of a wizard as Cadmus or Ignotus. In my view, this is also why he sought to create \"the most powerful wand in the world\", to best the objects of his brothers, and have \"the most powerful Hallow\". \n\nYet, unlike his two brothers, his boasting and pride in the object resulted in not only the start of the Elder Wand mythos and legends, but his own murder. Likewise, based on the information from Pottermore (see below), it's entirely possible that Antioch Peverell created a wand that never \"chose\" him.\n\nPottermore also says the following:\n\n> You might want a unicorn tail core, or decide that yew tree is definitely going to make the best wand for you, but Mr. Ollivander tells us it's not that simple. You will need 'an initial attraction and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.' [(Source)](https://www.pottermore.com/features/5-things-we-learned-from-wise-Mr-Ollivander)\n\nLooking at the components of the Elder Wand, it's important to note the wood: elder. \n\nIf you take the wand quiz on Pottermore, anyone, given certain answers, can also receive an elder wand. Given, the core will be different than that of \"the Elder Wand\", but it's important to note that the wand wood isn't noted to be \"the most powerful\" in itself.\n\n> \"The rarest wand wood of all, and reputed to be deeply unlucky, **the elder wand is trickier to master than any other. It contains powerful magic, but scorns to remain with any owner who is not the superior of his or her company; it takes a remarkable wizard to keep the elder wand for any length of time.** The old superstition, \u2018wand of elder, never prosper,\u2019 has its basis in this fear of the wand, but in fact, the superstition is baseless, and those foolish wandmakers who refuse to work with elder do so more because they doubt they will be able to sell their products than from fear of working with this wood. \n\n> The truth is that only a highly unusual person will find their perfect match in elder, and on the rare occasion when such a pairing occurs, I take it as certain that the witch or wizard in question is marked out for a special destiny. An additional fact that I have unearthed during my long years of study is that the owners of elder wands almost always feel a powerful affinity with those chosen by rowan.\" - J.K. Rowling as Garrick Ollivander, Pottermore [(Source)](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/wand-woods)\n\n-----------\n\n> And seeing as the Elder Wand was able to properly mend Harry's wand when Ollivander himself could not, I would argue that it is indeed more powerful than any other wand.\n\nI don't think this is due to the power of the wand, but due to the power of Harry himself. Harry, unlike Voldemort, \"won\" the wand, not by disarming Malfoy, but by having \"powerful\" magic himself.\n\nAccording to the information provided by Pottermore, elder wands tend to be very arrogant and \"picky\" wands when it comes to choosing their owners. However, Harry Potter is certainly no ordinary wizard, and as Ollivander claims, he was marked out for a \"special destiny\". Likewise, the Elder Wand considers Harry to be \"the superior of his or her company\".\n\n----------\n\n> One shouldn't accept that Ollivander is the end all-be all of wand makers too.\n\nWhile this is true, especially given what Rowling has written on the wandmakers of America, Ollivander's *does* have centuries, even thousands of years, of experience, trial-and-error, and experiments to build off of.

You also can't get a rosewood wand, as Fleur Delacour had. Certain woods, like birch, reed, and ivy, only seem to be available \"at Ollivander's branch shop / location in Hogsmeade\".\n\nIt seems to me that the Ollivander's, and wand industry in general, we see in the Harry Potter books is a reflection of how wand-making has been likely commercialized, and reflects the \"one-stop-shop\" attitude of modern [Muggle] society as well. \n\nAs opposed to going out, and putting a huge effort into finding a magical tree, chopping off a branch, carving said branch, hunting down a core, etc...you can pay someone else to do all of the work creating your wand *for* you. \n\n(Especially since Britain probably doesn't have nearly as many magical trees as it did centuries ago. Finding one, especially with little to no experience in identification and Herbology, would probably be very difficult.)\n\nFor example, on Pottermore, you could possibly get one of 42 possible wand woods. Why go out, and go through all of the effort for the slim chance that you can find a magical tree...when Ollivander's has them all available at their location, already made into a wand, and ready to test out? \n\nOr, for that matter, why go through the effort of trying to chop of the branch of a magical tree, such as the Whomping Willow, or get a hair from a creature such as a unicorn, when it's quite possible that it could *kill* you?\n\nOllivander mentions almost having been \"gored\" by the unicorn he plucked the tail hair for Cedric Diggory's wand in *Goblet of Fire*.

I imagine that if he can't see thestrals then working with invisible hair would be unimaginably hard.\n\nI'm not sure if Ollivander can see thestrals, but personally, given his advanced age and life experience, I'd say he more likely than not can probably see them. However, by his own admission, Ollivander only works with his three \"Supreme Cores\": dragon heartstring, unicorn hair, and phoenix feather.\n\nIn *Goblet of Fire*, Ollivander also sort-of-knocked Fleur Delacour's wand, which had a core of veela hair.\n\n> \u201cYes,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cnine and a half inches...inflexible...rosewood...and containing...dear me...\"\n\n> \u201cAn \u2019air from ze \u2019ead of a veela,\u201d said Fleur. \u201cOne of my grandmuzzer\u2019s.\u201d \n\n> \u201cYes,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, \u201cyes, I\u2019ve never used veela hair myself, of course. I find it makes for rather temperamental wands...however, to each his own, and if this suits you...\"\n\nI don't think that thestral tail hair has been used as a wand core in a very long time, for two reasons: one, as you said, not everyone can see thestrals to collect their hair for a wand core. Two, the wizarding world generally regards thestrals not only as \"ugly\" and \"grotesque\", but as \"an omen of death\" and \"deeply unlucky\". \n\nPairing elder, a \"deeply unlucky\" wood that Ollivander says that \"many wandmakers are too afraid to work with out of superstition\", with a the core of tail hair of an equally \"deeply unlucky\" creature, is probably practically unheard of. \n\nDue to this, it was likely coined the \"Deathstick\" (originally) due to the deeply-ingrained societal superstition surrounding its wood and core, as well as the \"deeply unlucky\" fates of the wand's owner(s).", "id": "d9kkpzb"}, {"comment": "No ordinary wand could completely repair another by itself.

Harry stole Draco's wand from him and it counted. I'm pretty sure the only prerequisite is that it has to be taken against the owner's will. \n\nPlus, the rules when it comes to wands aren't exactly concrete. The books establish that they're semi-sentient and pass their ownership pretty much as they will. Plus, Rowling has said before that the Elder Wand is unique in that is has no loyalty and only respects strength.

The wand that Ron uses for most of the first 2 books is a hand-me-down from his big brother and his magic is very lackluster and seems more difficult to perform. Likewise, the wand used by Neville Longbottom for the first 5 books was inherited from his father.

", "id": "d9ku4sp"}, {"comment": "I think passing wands along through families is more so a relic of tradition from the \"old days\". \n\nBack in the day, more witches and wizards probably had to gather the wand components and make the wands themselves, which included putting themselves in path of potential injury and death. Ollivander himself mentions having been \"amost gored\" by the unicorn he took the hair for Cedric Diggory's wand core from, in *Goblet of Fire*.\n\nWands were probably rarer before there were more commerical wandmakers around, and thus, wands were once seen as important family heirlooms. The Weasleys, Slytherins, and the Malfoys are all Purebloods, and all three families are written as passing down wands to the \"next generation\". \n\nLucius Malfoy, according to Pottermore, wields the ancient wand of the Malfoy forebear, Armand Malfoy, who came to England from France (Normandy) as an ally of William the Conqueror. \n\nThus, the wand of Armand Malfoy is not only nearly 1,000 years old, but likely the Malfoys' most prized possession. Everything their family has achieved in a milennia, everything they are and have done, and their entire family's history is represented by that wand. Thus, to the Malfoys, it is probably a great honor to \"pass down the wand from father to son\", as has been done for centuries.\n\nLikewise, in \"A History of Magic in North America\", J.K. Rowling wrote of how Salazar Slytherin passed down his own wand to his children as well. The Gaunt family - particularly, the Irish branch - once held Slytherin's wand as a priceless family heirloom, a direct relic that proved their descent from the Founder. \n\nWhen Gormlaith Gaunt, the last wielder of the wand, was killed, however, Slytherin's wand was buried by Gormlaith's niece, Isolt Sayre, on the grounds of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in America [on Mount Greylock, near the town of Adams, Massachusetts]. \n\nLikewise, Rowling has said that, sometimes, witches and wizards are also buried directly with their wands when they die. This was likely the case in what happened to Lily Potter's and James Potter's wands; they were buried with them in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.\n\nSometimes, wands are \"buried\", or so it seems, in order to grow or give life to a new magical tree. For example, Rowling writes that the ground above Slytherin's wand sprouted a \"snakewood / buckthorn tree with magical properties\", and that, when buried, a yew wand (likely inferred as with Lord Voldemort's burial) \"generally sprouts into a tree guarding the dead owner\u2019s grave\".", "id": "d9lxoea"}, {"comment": "> ds right and with just the little research I did, it holds up.

Grindelwald was already a powerful wizard as evidenced that he had been kicked out of Durmstrang for \"experimenting\" and his close association to Dumbledore, who considered him an equal. If they were almost equal in skill then possession of the elder wand should have pushed Grindelwald over the top.

Darth Vader, when pronounced in German, literally translates to Darth Father. Darth Tyranus is a tyrant of the Separatist movement. Why would the same not apply to Darth Plagueis?\n\nI disagree. In fact, I believe he situation to be quite the opposite; their names are meant to be ironic opposites of their owners. Remember, Sith are given titles by their *masters*, and in a relationship that is meant to train and develop one in the ways of hatred, nothing could be more beneficial to that relationship than to give a Sith apprentice a purposefully inaccurate title.\n\nDarth Tyrannus was still always a political idealist, no matter what role he undertook; it can be assumed that this trait would have remained even if he had won the war, or even without Palpatine's influence. Darth Maul, in contrast to his name, was more calculating and efficient than people give him credit for; he purposefully lured his Jedi assailants into a small room where they could be fought and beaten more easily. Not only that, but he didn't even \"maul\" them; he only stabbed one, and the entire time he threw calculated swings instead of wailing on them. As for Darth Vader, he was named as such likely to poke fun at his weakness - his family. To a Sith, making fun of weakness is a really, *really* big insult.\n\nAnd as for Sidious? The case can be made for your argument or mine, I suppose. Yes, he did infiltrate the Republic as a kind old grandfatherly man, but at the same time he did blatantly vie for power the entire time, and had to rely on both the Dark Side and the ineptitude of the Jedi to make sure he wasn't taken down early. And once he secured his position as Emperor, he *really* dropped the subtlety.\n\nSo then what of Plagueis? Yes, perhaps the dark side is corrupting him like so; but remember, this is the man that can quite literally *create and preserve life*, the opposite of what a plague does.\n\nSecondly,\n\n>After hearing about how the Jedi describe the Force and the Dark Side, which can be akin to a cancer, a sickness... or a Plague, one can safely say that Plagueis is the manifestation of the Dark Side of the force. If that's the case, then Plagueis must be destroyed to bring Balance to the Force.\n\nI must disagree here. While the idea that Plagueis is using host bodies to survive isn't unlikely, the idea that he is a literal manifestation of the dark side is quite off.\n\nFor one thing, if there's anything in-universe that we should take away from the prequels (aside from it's writing issues), it's that *the Jedi are wrong about almost everything*. They actively betray their own code, they fail to suppress emotion, and stick to dogmatic principles instead of acting when they truly should. From all of this, I think it's safe to say that their understanding of the Force is off by a longshot, at least their interpretation of the dark side.\n\nRemember, the Force flows through all living things; this was established by a Jedi, but it is not necessarily a Jedi concept. The Sith, too, believe this to be the case, and choose to use that Force to empower themselves, as they see it to be their natural right. Not only that, but they too view the opposite side of the Force as \"weakness\"; almost *disease-like*, if you will.\n\nSo what's my point? My point is, the light side and the dark side are both different parts to the same beast, a vast entity that acts through all life. As such, declaring one a weakness that, when removed, would bring \"balance\" to the Force is completely wrong. This is something I've always hated about the films; the Jedi perspective on the Force is always pushed on the audience, when in reality the Force is much more complex than that."], [41, "Another spin on this could include the 'Rey is Anakin' theory.

Two points, however:\n\n>Throughout the Star Wars Saga, the Sith Lords have taken to naming themselves after certain aspects of their personality. Darth Sidious causes gradual decay to the Republic and those around him over time. Darth Maul is savage and brutal and prefers to, ahem, Maul his opponents. Darth Vader, when pronounced in German, literally translates to Darth Father. Darth Tyranus is a tyrant of the Separatist movement. Why would the same not apply to Darth Plagueis?\n\nI disagree. In fact, I believe he situation to be quite the opposite; their names are meant to be ironic opposites of their owners. Remember, Sith are given titles by their *masters*, and in a relationship that is meant to train and develop one in the ways of hatred, nothing could be more beneficial to that relationship than to give a Sith apprentice a purposefully inaccurate title.\n\nDarth Tyrannus was still always a political idealist, no matter what role he undertook; it can be assumed that this trait would have remained even if he had won the war, or even without Palpatine's influence. Darth Maul, in contrast to his name, was more calculating and efficient than people give him credit for; he purposefully lured his Jedi assailants into a small room where they could be fought and beaten more easily. Not only that, but he didn't even \"maul\" them; he only stabbed one, and the entire time he threw calculated swings instead of wailing on them.

And once he secured his position as Emperor, he *really* dropped the subtlety.\n\nSo then what of Plagueis?

If that's the case, then Plagueis must be destroyed to bring Balance to the Force.\n\nI must disagree here. While the idea that Plagueis is using host bodies to survive isn't unlikely, the idea that he is a literal manifestation of the dark side is quite off.\n\nFor one thing, if there's anything in-universe that we should take away from the prequels (aside from it's writing issues), it's that *the Jedi are wrong about almost everything*. They actively betray their own code, they fail to suppress emotion, and stick to dogmatic principles instead of acting when they truly should. From all of this, I think it's safe to say that their understanding of the Force is off by a longshot, at least their interpretation of the dark side.\n\nRemember, the Force flows through all living things; this was established by a Jedi, but it is not necessarily a Jedi concept. The Sith, too, believe this to be the case, and choose to use that Force to empower themselves, as they see it to be their natural right. Not only that, but they too view the opposite side of the Force as \"weakness\"; almost *disease-like*, if you will.\n\nSo what's my point? My point is, the light side and the dark side are both different parts to the same beast, a vast entity that acts through all life. As such, declaring one a weakness that, when removed, would bring \"balance\" to the Force is completely wrong. This is something I've always hated about the films; the Jedi perspective on the Force is always pushed on the audience, when in reality the Force is much more complex than that.", "id": "czbya2j"}, {"comment": "I like this theory, but it seems a little convoluted to name Sith in this way, simply to insult them. And if it weren't for Episode VII coming around, the Force would have been forever 'balanced', as in 'Free of The Dark Side'. All the Sith had been destroyed, the Dark Side left to whither and die. I too see the Dark Side as essential, but not in the way that it has to be equal to the light. If it weren't for the Dark Side returning when and how it did, the Universe would not have enjoyed the brief stint of peace and light that it had.

In the end, there is no such thing as balance while there is such thing as the Force.\n\n>I too see the Dark Side as essential, but not in the way that it has to be equal to the light.\n\nNow, I agree with you here, in a way; the dark side does not have to be *equal* to the light either. \"Balance\", while it cannot be a total elimination of either side, is not in turn the exact equality between both halves. In Legends, you could consider this balance to be true during the old Sith Wars, and the Great Hyperspace War, even the Jedi Civil War during its early stages. Clearly this was not a form of balance either, and as such Force equality =/= balance. So you're right, I'm just trying to clarify that point.\n\n>All the Sith had been destroyed, the Dark Side left to whither and die...if it weren't for the Dark Side returning when and how it did, the Universe would not have enjoyed the brief stint of peace and light that it had.\n\nDid you know that, despite the Sith near extinction, the galaxy was, for all intents and purposes, going through a vast era of light side dominion? Even without the thousands of years of peace from Legends after the disappearance of Darth Bane and Darth Zannah, you still have a large period of time - nearly a millenium during Yoda's lifespan - in which the Sith were not acting throughout the galaxy.\n\nSo what happened during that time? Did the galaxy enjoy peace like it never did? Nope! Instead it went through hundreds of small conflicts, aggravated by the inefficiency of the bureaucrats and autocrats of the Republic, whose authority was upheld by - you guessed it - the Jedi. Corruption, greed, and ignorance bloomed under the Jedi-backed Republic. This era of light-side rule was *not* good by any means, and while a dark-side era wouldn't be preferable, that doesn't make the situation with the Republic and its stagnation better.\n\n>All that happens, even the Dark Side's resurgence, seems to have purpose.\n\nIndeed, the Force is behind nearly every galactic event in history. It sets the stage for massive wars between religious sects that represent both halves of it - Light and Dark - all for some vague sense of \"balance\".

Klimo presents a lot of evidence that this is what Lucas was going for in his saga.\nLuke is the only fore user in the films that develops a mature acceptance that people have both 'good' and 'bad' emotions and you can't eliminate either entirely but must accept them with letting them control you (which is a key teaching in many Eastern religions that inspired Star Wars). Balance doesn't come from eliminating one side or the other, but through integration.\n\nIt may have been trying to teach a new more balanced, more nuanced version of the Jedi code that Luke failed in his training of Kylo Ren and others (imagine trying to teach kids not to judge their emotions and view everything in black and white, good and bad terms).\nUnfortunately, I'm not convinced the forces behind Disney's Star Wars have this level of understanding, or at least that they will be allowed to explore things beyond the straightforward good guy, bad guy drama.", "id": "czcb2mk"}, {"comment": ">Such a thing is abhorrent, to me at least; it let's you know who the *real* villain in Star Wars is.\n\nThis is why I've  always loved Kreia from KOTOR 2.", "id": "czcbf1x"}, {"comment": "A bit random, but this seems like a good place to ask.

Its probable that Vader stopped Luke out of reflex, stopping his son from going down the same path he did.", "id": "d0abi27"}, {"comment": "Maybe Vader knew more than we think. \n\nLook all the way back to Episode 4. It seems as though Vader failed to appreciate Obi-Wan's final words. Of course, \"more powerful than you can possibly imagine,\" did take on two meanings, and both are true. One, he continued from his physical death, and two he was a martyr for Luke. Later on, Vader made it clear that he knew that Obi-Wan was still instructing Luke. \n\nIn Empire, regarding which is more powerful, light or dark,  Yoda tells Luke \"we are luminous beings, not this crude matter.\" He is making it clear that the dark/light sides have a very different philosophy on their own nature, and relationship with the physical world. \n\nIn the PT, Lucas attempts to clarify why there aren't tons of force ghosts running around in the OT, and how it is that Vader wouldn't have taken Obi-Wan's final words more seriously- it's because the ability to communicate with the living is a higher order, and typically only occurred when the spirit feels they have some sort of unfinished business. But this doesn't mean that the Jedi had no concept of the afterlife. What it really means is that the Jedi are taught to believe that death was a separation from the physical, and that they were meant to become one with the force, even giving up their ability or desire to communicate directly with the living.\n\nSo here's the point I'm trying to make, and I believe it actually bolsters your theory: Vader does know all of this. The Sith know of this possibility, but consider it a weak and powerless form. Even if a Force Ghost could communicate, it doesn't wield *true power,* as the Sith would define it. To Vader, this threat was empty. \"Big deal, you might be a force ghost. Who the fuck cares, you can only talk to me if I want you to.\" And his mind was too clouded with Obi-Wan's presence to realize his own son was watching this event transpire.\n\nVader may have believed that this was the true destiny of the Dark Side. But like any Sith, he wanted to hold on to his current form as long as possible. Perhaps a Sith prepares his whole life for that moment when he engages in a kind of \"spiritual warfare,\" with his master. The winner of this battle of wills truly owns the long standing power of the dark side, while maintaining some semblance of themselves. This is why Vader didn't want to destroy Luke in Empire. It would have been a tremendous loss. But when he says, \"..rule as father and son!\" He is also saying that taking on Luke as his pupil will give him the strength of will to not only defeat the Emperor physically, but also win the battle of wills for the ultimate power of the Dark Side.\n\nFlash forward. Had Luke struck down the Emperor, then Vader would have had to physically fight Luke, while also fighting the spiritual battle with Sidious. He would have lost both. He would have then made sure that Luke struck him down (in Vader's body, then he would have jumped on over to Luke, who wouldn't really know what the hell was happening). All part of his Grand Scheme. A win win. The easiest path is literally for Luke to strike him down. If Luke prevails, he knows his physical body doesn't have much time left, and he can hop on over to Luke. If Vader wins, you're back at square one, but other options will present themselves. (Leia comes to mind).\n\nSo Anakin was also fighting Sidious after he threw him down the shaft. But having turned to the light, he only had the strength to tell Luke that he has been saved. Enter Sidious' dark spirit. Of course, it took a bit of time for the two sides to manifest themselves. And Anakin may not have known (yet) that Sidious/Plaguess etc. had survived. He may have believed that his body dying was enough. It was only later that this was realized, after all the fireworks and yu-nubbing.\n", "id": "d0hdvri"}], [{"comment": "Combine this with the Darth Jar Jar theory and incorporated into the next two movies(8 and 9, not 3 1/2) this will be somehow more of the greatest film series of all time.

Rex in one of the recent episodes of Star Wars Rebels says how they don't make the armor like they used to after getting hit and brushing it off. I'd assume this is because there are way more storm troopers now than there ever were clone troopers because of how well consolidated the Empire becomes after the war. So with more troops there is a higher demand for armor and they produce it cheap and fast to meet demands.

For that purpose, this armor set would be more than enough."], [29, "The blaster shots aren't OHKOs.

"], [9, "It was made to protect then from blaster shots of smaller, legal weapons. The ones the Alliance had were more powerful and were obtained illegally."], [11, "Whenever this topic comes up, blasters don't get the respect they deserve. Guns can be made in the Star Wars verse but blasters are just so much more deadly. In ANH, we see the less armored rebel troops die not to glancing blows, but the heat wave from near misses. That's what stormie armor is designed to prevent; it's pretty difficult to survive a direct hit without plot armor, but they can and do protect against otherwise lethal near misses. "], [12, "This is a thing I've noticed about the new movie (episode 7) that I'm pretty sure the fanbase is completely wrong about: what blasters actually do. A lot of debate has happened whereby the consensus, due to expanded universe writings, is that blasters emit a very hot \"slug\" of something similar to matter which simply melts through just about everything and results in both burns and bludgeoning injury upon hit.\n\nI think this is 100% wrong, take the name: **BLAST**er. Its a semi/fully automatic weapon which launches explosive projectiles. From episode 7 these projectiles are able to throw a person, fully armored, several feet from a glancing blast. It is essentially a weapon fully capable of launching high explosive grenades (of our world) in rapid succession with minimal carry weight. While the highest amount of damage would be at the point of contact, whereby whatever field containing the energy of the bolt fails, it would still result in a massive concussion wave due to thermal shock.\n\nAs such, the armor is actually 100% viable as it reduces and even prevents concussion waves from doing damage. In episode 7 you see nearby rebel soldiers getting thrown around and killed, but nearby Stormtroopers of blasts are mostly unharmed.\n\nEven in the expanded universe, which is no longer canon, the black material is considered a \"body-glove\" which allows a person to endure massive differences in temperature and pressure. Compounded with a material that is as hard as modern steel, but light-weight as plastic, and you get a soldier that is easily able to endure almost all lower technology engagements... Except for the Ewoks because that was probably really bad writing. I could go on about how terrible the Ewok vs Stormtrooper engagements were, but I think you get the point since I already discussed how, in the expanded universe, the material the Stormtroopers are wearing is as hard and thick as medieval plate-mail with the ability to better absorb thermal shock and concussion waves.\n\nSo once again, the reason Stormtroopers wear the armor is as follows: intimidation, ability to survive hostile environments, and the ability to be unharmed by nearby lower-grade explosives in a world whereby every crook and smuggler carries a semi-automatic grenade launcher with seeming unlimited ammunition.\n\nThen again, this is Starwars, whereby a single proton torpedo doesn't blow up entire continents...

Whenever we see a Blaster fired on a Trooper, the result is a scorched mark on the outer shell.  Yet, the armour can't be tight fitting as, I'm assuming, there must be a slight gap between the inner layer and the body suit.  So does the energy from a Blaster actually absorb through the armour and onto the body?"], [3, "Well look at The Force Awakens. When Chewy shoots the stormtrooper when they infiltrate Starkiller Base, if you look closely his armour literally shatters to pieces...\n\nSo yeah, stormtroopers are meant to be expendable. "], [3, "My headcanon has always been that the stormtrooper armor dissipates the blaster energy over a large section of the body. Thus instead of a burning hole in your chest, you just feel like you got tackled by a linebacker. The stormtroopers get knocked down and knocked out, but they'll recover just fine. \n\nThis gives the stormtroopers an extra incentive to fight to the last man. Huge numbers of them are perfectly fine, but lying helpless on the ground. They will be easy to kill unless their comrades win the day and the empire controls the ground they lie on.\n\nThis is why the stones and spears of the ewoks are so effective.

People are thrown from car wreaks and survive, people are hit by cars and survive. A giant log smacking you, from a free standing position without actually crushing you doesn't necessarily kill someone.

A lot of debate has happened whereby the consensus, due to expanded universe writings, is that blasters emit a very hot \"slug\" of something similar to matter which simply melts through just about everything and results in both burns and bludgeoning injury upon hit.\n\nI think this is 100% wrong, take the name: **BLAST**er. Its a semi/fully automatic weapon which launches explosive projectiles. From episode 7 these projectiles are able to throw a person, fully armored, several feet from a glancing blast. It is essentially a weapon fully capable of launching high explosive grenades (of our world) in rapid succession with minimal carry weight. While the highest amount of damage would be at the point of contact, whereby whatever field containing the energy of the bolt fails, it would still result in a massive concussion wave due to thermal shock.\n\nAs such, the armor is actually 100% viable as it reduces and even prevents concussion waves from doing damage. In episode 7 you see nearby rebel soldiers getting thrown around and killed, but nearby Stormtroopers of blasts are mostly unharmed.\n\nEven in the expanded universe, which is no longer canon, the black material is considered a \"body-glove\" which allows a person to endure massive differences in temperature and pressure. Compounded with a material that is as hard as modern steel, but light-weight as plastic, and you get a soldier that is easily able to endure almost all lower technology engagements... Except for the Ewoks because that was probably really bad writing. I could go on about how terrible the Ewok vs Stormtrooper engagements were, but I think you get the point since I already discussed how, in the expanded universe, the material the Stormtroopers are wearing is as hard and thick as medieval plate-mail with the ability to better absorb thermal shock and concussion waves.\n\nSo once again, the reason Stormtroopers wear the armor is as follows: intimidation, ability to survive hostile environments, and the ability to be unharmed by nearby lower-grade explosives in a world whereby every crook and smuggler carries a semi-automatic grenade launcher with seeming unlimited ammunition.\n\nThen again, this is Starwars, whereby a single proton torpedo doesn't blow up entire continents...

I love, and fully agree with you, about what Barb is meant to represent and why her death is irreversible. The cuts between the sex scenes and the demogorgon death had not occurred to me before, and the way you explain it makes perfect sense.\n\nHowever, I would take issue with your characterization of Barb.  Barb doesn't seem to disagree with sex per se, just sex with Steve, because she thinks sex is all Steve is interested in.  At the time, she's right--it's only later that Steve starts to realize he feels more than lust for Nancy.  We also see that Barb's issue is not morality--when she chides Nancy for going in for sex, she doesn't do so on moral grounds, but on grounds of self-affirmation--\"This isn't you.\"  Nancy's sexual awakening isn't an act of rebellion, it's something she's doing because everyone else is.  Jonathon underscores this later--\"You're a teenage girl who thinks she's rebelling by doing the exact same thing as every other teenage girl.\"  \n\nMore to the point, if Barb is an image of Nancy's virginity, and you say the message is that it's okay--even necessary--to kill your virginity, then that would mean Barb's death is supposed to be seen as okay--even positive.  Which it was certainly not framed as--it was dark and horrific, not merely \"harsh.\"   Nancy bitterly regrets Barb's loss and would do almost anything to get her back.\n\nIn fact, Barb is presented very positively, not in the negative way you seem to be framing her here. She's part of Nancy's school life and helps her pursue her intellectual ambitions, in contrast to Steve, who is bored with Nancy's attempts to pursue a career and merely interested in her as a sexual object.  Barb disagrees with Nancy's actions, but follows along loyally (enduring being ignored by her friend and pressured into situations where she feels uncomfortable) until Nancy flat-out tells her to leave.  You say she's \"pouting\" and not participating when she's killed, but Jonathon's picture--with its wide angle--surely casts her as lonely, forsaken by her friends--rather than \"pouty\" (and anyway, who is she supposed to be \"participating\" with?  Doing a threesome with Steve or his asshole friends?)\n\nBasically, I like your interpretation of who Barb is meant to be, but I disagree very strongly with your take on how Barb--and her death--is meant to be viewed."], [253, "This is without a doubt one of the best analyses I've seen in this subreddit in the last year.

This is right up there with Steve turning out to be an okay guy, and Nancy staying with him.\n\nThe criticism of Barb's death isn't that it's \"random\", it's that there was almost no in-universe reaction.  Even when Nancy finds out about her fate, the shock lasts a few minutes.  It did motivate her more to go on the warpath vs. the Demogorgon, but that wasn't made explicit and could easily have been ignored given the non-Barb-related \"endgame\" ambiance of that point.\n\nAlso, while there may be patriarchal undertones to the Hollywood trope, it almost always is a case of the girl being \"corrupted\" or a \"slut\", but is it really that common for only the girl to die in horror movies?  I thought that it was considered a death sentence for both."], [31, "This is very well detailed, and used up a big chunk of my last hour at work.

It's much more realistic than her getting together with Jonathan, and it doesn't demonize the \"popular guy\" like a lot of horror movies. It was refreshing overall to see steve skirt the line between good guy and asshole, as many high school kids do, and it was cool that he was nuanced and clearly had a developing/fluid sense of self and morality. \n\nI'm not one to be as detailed as you just were, but I think Steve is as much of a revolt on the stereotypes as Nancy. Jonathan also seemed to break a lot of the \"weird kid\" stereotypes as well now that I think about it. Amazing what happens when characters are treated realistically.

It's certainly clear that Barb serves at least partially as a physical manifestation of Nancy's virginity, but if anything her death only further supports the trope(s) surrounding female sexuality and friendship in the horror genre. \n\nWhy does she die? Why is she even at the party? Because her best friend is interested in sex. Barb doesn't die as punishment for her \"abstinence\" she dies as a punishment, frankly, for her best friend using her.\n\nLook at the circumstances leading up to this. Steve wants Nancy to join him and his friends for a \"party\", which is of course a pretense to be alone with her. Barb has no real interest in going, but Nancy convinces her. Perhaps out of genuine desire to bring her along, but also because she needs an alibi and a ride. On the way she even tells Barb she doesn't want to do anything with Steve, and asks Barb to make sure she doesn't.\n\nBut what happens? Nancy sends Barb away because in reality she does want to have sex with Steve. And what happens once she has given in to these urges? Her best friend is taken and killed by a monster. \n\nThat seems like a pretty textbook horror \"sex is evil\" trope."], [13, "I'd like to add to your theory by reminding you that Barb is used in this way even after that scene, when the police and Nancy's parents both focus in on her virginity when Barb's safety should be their primary concern.

Barb wants a relationship but is afraid to come out and say it. This show takes place in a time when coming out could have some very real and terrible consequences. She sticks with her friend trying to show her the folly of her mistake but is mocked and rebuffed by the others.

Seek and ye will find? Basically what I'm saying is even if there is no symbolism, you could find it. Humans seek order in chaos, so I suppose I get it a little, but the cuts from barbs death to Nancy's sex scene is just a bit of juxtaposition. It was also done to show you that both events are happening simultaneously. Beyond that I believe the only symbolism is what you interpret.\nI really have always wondered. Do they honestly believe the writer either A. Came up with a story, then tried to make every character interaction symbolic in some way or B. Had a bunch of symbolism ideas and crunched them into a story? \nI have read many books on writing. My favorite was by Stephen King. He is an excellent storyteller who swears by not even using an outline for his stories. So is there symbolism in there?

She's not (entirely) doing it to \"fit in\" or go along with her friends, because even her best friend is uninterested.  It lends a strength to Nancys character that what she is doing is, at some level, her own independent choice about her life.

I love, and fully agree with you, about what Barb is meant to represent and why her death is irreversible. The cuts between the sex scenes and the demogorgon death had not occurred to me before, and the way you explain it makes perfect sense.\n\nHowever, I would take issue with your characterization of Barb.  Barb doesn't seem to disagree with sex per se, just sex with Steve, because she thinks sex is all Steve is interested in.  At the time, she's right--it's only later that Steve starts to realize he feels more than lust for Nancy.  We also see that Barb's issue is not morality--when she chides Nancy for going in for sex, she doesn't do so on moral grounds, but on grounds of self-affirmation--\"This isn't you.\"  Nancy's sexual awakening isn't an act of rebellion, it's something she's doing because everyone else is.  Jonathon underscores this later--\"You're a teenage girl who thinks she's rebelling by doing the exact same thing as every other teenage girl.\"  \n\nMore to the point, if Barb is an image of Nancy's virginity, and you say the message is that it's okay--even necessary--to kill your virginity, then that would mean Barb's death is supposed to be seen as okay--even positive.  Which it was certainly not framed as--it was dark and horrific, not merely \"harsh.\"   Nancy bitterly regrets Barb's loss and would do almost anything to get her back.\n\nIn fact, Barb is presented very positively, not in the negative way you seem to be framing her here. She's part of Nancy's school life and helps her pursue her intellectual ambitions, in contrast to Steve, who is bored with Nancy's attempts to pursue a career and merely interested in her as a sexual object.  Barb disagrees with Nancy's actions, but follows along loyally (enduring being ignored by her friend and pressured into situations where she feels uncomfortable) until Nancy flat-out tells her to leave.  You say she's \"pouting\" and not participating when she's killed, but Jonathon's picture--with its wide angle--surely casts her as lonely, forsaken by her friends--rather than \"pouty\" (and anyway, who is she supposed to be \"participating\" with?  Doing a threesome with Steve or his asshole friends?)\n\nBasically, I like your interpretation of who Barb is meant to be, but I disagree very strongly with your take on how Barb--and her death--is meant to be viewed.", "id": "d75ufwr"}, {"comment": "Hah, threesome with Steve or his asshole friend. \n\nYou have definitely convinced me that I did not do to justice (heh) to Barb's character.

It did motivate her more to go on the warpath vs. the Demogorgon, but that wasn't made explicit and could easily have been ignored given the non-Barb-related \"endgame\" ambiance of that point.\n\nAlso, while there may be patriarchal undertones to the Hollywood trope, it almost always is a case of the girl being \"corrupted\" or a \"slut\", but is it really that common for only the girl to die in horror movies?

I have to think the Duffers are casting a big side-eye behind closed doors.\n\nAs for the lack of reaction... the only character in the show who really cares about her becomes more invested in investigating the goings-on as a result. She has a motive to not act out like it's a big deal, because then her little brother is more than vindicated in his emotion for his missing friend.\n\nWhen it's said and done I wonder if this controversy would've surfaced if her encounter hadn't closed and opened episodes so dramatically.

Why is she even at the party? Because her best friend is interested in sex. Barb doesn't die as punishment for her \"abstinence\" she dies as a punishment, frankly, for her best friend using her.\n\nLook at the circumstances leading up to this. Steve wants Nancy to join him and his friends for a \"party\", which is of course a pretense to be alone with her. Barb has no real interest in going, but Nancy convinces her. Perhaps out of genuine desire to bring her along, but also because she needs an alibi and a ride. On the way she even tells Barb she doesn't want to do anything with Steve, and asks Barb to make sure she doesn't.\n\nBut what happens?

I don't think the sex is the important aspect in the scene, to be honest.  What's important is the abandonment.\n\nStranger Things is very much a show about outsiders and insiders--Mainstream culture and the \"strangers\" that live outside it.  Nancy, when we're introduced to her, is something of an outsider--a brainy girl who apparently used to do some D & D stuff back in the day--but puberty has made her suddenly attractive to the popular crowd--the insiders.  Nancy's intrigued by popularity--as who wouldn't be--but Barb worries this is changing her.\n\nNancy going upstairs isn't so much about the sex as it is about the move to join the \"cool crowd\".  All the cool kids are having sex.  Nancy assumes she should too.  Barb pleads with her, seeing that Nancy isn't really into this--\"rebelling\" in the same way every popular teenager is rebelling--but Nancy deserts her outsider friend.\n\nSo yes, Barb dies, and yes you're right, it's totally Nancy's fault (honestly I think her mother should have taken her to task more on this point), but Nancy's crime isn't sex.

This is a great setup for Steve because we later get a much better look at who he really is and when his character opens up we see that this initial impression may not be so accurate.\n\n\nIn that light, it is also justifying Barbs earlier concerns.\n\nOn that note I'm not sure I entirely agree with your idea that Barbs death being a parallel to Nancys new outlook on life away from sexual naivety, but rather Barb is there to help show us that Nancy is doing what she's doing from her own mind.  She's not (entirely) doing it to \"fit in\" or go along with her friends, because even her best friend is uninterested.  It lends a strength to Nancys character that what she is doing is, at some level, her own independent choice about her life.  Building from that, the separation from Barb and then Barbs death acts as a nudge over the threshold for Nancy to get involved in the bigger story - becoming her own agent in the world at large.\n\n\n", "id": "d76on9e"}], [{"comment": "Your choice of diction makes for an attractive, comprehensive, clear, and fluent analysis.

If you didn't know that I encourage you to look into it. Fascinating stuff. \n\nI liked your addition about the ships dialect. I hadn't heard that before. I'm not sure it necessarily means it's \"dumb\" though. If a child were raised by British parents in the United States and it never went out, it would have a British accent because it's blocked out from every single accent surrounding it. Since it seems like the millennium falcon only ever spoke with Han, it's dialect developed in a closed off system that wouldn't follow the same patterns as any other robot. In that case, the dialect would be entirely specific to Han and the MF, like if the British family I mentioned stopped interacting with the outside world completely for a long time, they would still speak recognizable English, but they would have developed there own slang and not learned of popular slang so that eventually they would even sound different from anyone else British. \n\nTl;dr the millennium falcon isn't necessarily stupid, but instead of saying things like \"swag\" it says \"holy moley\" or something weird. \n\nBut maybe you're right about it being dumb and Han knows that, and that's why he's offended when luke(I think) says \"what a piece of junk\".\n\n\"That's my Down syndrome kid you're calling a piece of junk, and it's perfect the way it is\"\n\nHan may be a bad ass, but apparently he's a softie.

That's not to say Han isn't gifted, I think you're quite right that he's above-average even by his day's standards, but I also think a lot of his lucky breaks are from him being an accidental force-user rather than from his ability to quickly crunch algorithms.

It is that simple, he is just confident and lucky. That's part of his charm and it's why he's good at cards. Lando is also confident and lucky, but not as lucky as Han. Luck as a character trait is much more reasonable to assume than him being a savant who actively tries to hide his genius from even his closest friends. He truly loves the falcon, and it is an amazing ship that he was LUCKY to have and doesn't want to lose. It's been owned by and suped up by plenty of smugglers before him. That's why it's so fast, breaking all the time, and it speaks a weird dialect.\n\nHe's definitely not sexy, charismatic, a good leader AND bad at relating to people. He's a \"terrible father\" because he had a stressful job a crumbling marriage and Kylo has only child syndrome. He keeps Chewie as a co-pilot because he's a huge loyal beast who will rip off the arms of his enemies and won't stab him in the back. Not to mention he's also a handy mechanic (sorta) and a cool character. He works is a dangerous profession and can't afford to trust most people. That's why he takes payment in advance, pulls his gun on people in the bar and another reason his friendship with Luke is so significant to him that he'd risk his life on multiple occasions for him. Luke was an honest, trustworthy lovable guy that Han took a liking to and could trust as much as he could trust Chewie.  \n\nHan's run in with the empire that made him drop his cargo exposes him as a lying scoundrel, how could he claim to be faster than the empire while also getting pulled over and dropping his cargo. It also serves to set up the empire as a far reaching powerful galactic government that cracks down on crime and who nobody is immune to. \n\nThis is the same universe where Qui Gon Jinn walks into the only dealer with a T-14 hyperdrive generator on his first guess, where the chosen Jedi happens to be working as a slave, right before a huge race he also happens to have a ship for and who happens to try the right button to fire missiles at the critical hit spot that he happened to be pointing strait at at the same time that he happened to regain control of his ship.

In that case, the dialect would be entirely specific to Han and the MF, like if the British family I mentioned stopped interacting with the outside world completely for a long time, they would still speak recognizable English, but they would have developed there own slang and not learned of popular slang so that eventually they would even sound different from anyone else British. \n\nTl;dr the millennium falcon isn't necessarily stupid, but instead of saying things like \"swag\" it says \"holy moley\" or something weird. \n\nBut maybe you're right about it being dumb and Han knows that, and that's why he's offended when luke(I think) says \"what a piece of junk\".\n\n\"That's my Down syndrome kid you're calling a piece of junk, and it's perfect the way it is\"\n\nHan may be a bad ass, but apparently he's a softie.

I should say I really like your theory and you have some awesome examples of Spongebob doing crazy things, well done and tip of the hat.

King Neptune doesn't show up until ep. 19 anyhow and Spongebob had shown lots of powerful abilities by then. \n\nIn the Roman pantheon, only Zeus and Hera were usually more powerful than Neptune making him top three. You could argue Hera was more powerful and was also a god of 'love', (Spongebob uses love and imagination and his power-sources), but Spongebob is definitely male. Hera was also violent and vengeful and Spongebob seems to be more trickster. Spongebob is for sure not Zeus.\n\nBikini Bottom fishizens say Neptune instead of God (\"Oh my Neptune!\") so Spongebob besting Neptune puts him above the Roman pantheon, as well as his own world's power imho. \n\nAlso when he shows up in the Simpsons Jesus and Buddha don't even try to argue with him even though they clearly disagree.

So my theory is that Dr. Nefario clones minions for Gru in his lab, and while they are developing, he essentially plays the minion movie to them subconsciously so that they come out of the test tube ready to work and have unquestioning loyalty to Gru. We see Nefario do a version of this when he kidnaps all the minions in part 2, just before he starts turning them purple or whatever, he has them in an artificial paradise, for which there is no real reason to have unless he means to reprogram them, so to speak.  \n\nTL;DR: Events of Minions movie are fake memories for minion clones, ala Blade Runner's replicants.

So my theory is that Dr. Nefario clones minions for Gru in his lab, and while they are developing, he essentially plays the minion movie to them subconsciously so that they come out of the test tube ready to work and have unquestioning loyalty to Gru.

How would he have any way of knowing that Peter McCallister is a criminal?\n\nOn a final note, most people don't leave their valuables just lying out in the open.

You are absolutely right. I watched it about two weeks ago and noticed so many small details that added to the plot, that I never noticed as a kid.\n\nSeveral examples:\n\nMy sister asked me, why didn't the terminal lady count the tickets and notice that the McCallister's were one person short? I thought this was a good question. In the beginning of the movie, during the party, the dad throws away a single ticket. So even if the terminal lady did count the tickets to people, the number would be correct.\n\nWhy did Kevin have to go get a toothbrush from the store randomly? His mom must have packed his before they went on the trip, so he didn't have one. This led to him being called a thief and being chased by the police.\n\nWhy did Kevin use the cars as a way of knowing they were home if they used rental vans? Wouldn't he have known? I think that if they didn't lose power and sleep in, they would've taken their own cars. I'm not 100% sure though, since there is still nothing stopping them from taking their own cars. Nevermind, the taxi vans were waiting for them before they woke up.\n\nThe whole scene with Old Man Marley at church is recursive as fuck. Kevin tells him that the heater in the basement was scary but after going down there, he realized it was nothing. He was scared of Old Man Marley at first, but now he realizes that he is actually a nice old man. He then tells him that maybe if he calls his son, maybe it won't be that bad. He ends up seeing his grand daughter at the end of the movie. This idea of \"there's nothing to fear but fear itself\" basically occurs three times in this single scene, and it worked out each time.\n\nIf Kevin didn't mention that Fuller wets the bed, Fuller would've been left home with Kevin as well, but maybe they would've notice that two people were missing instead of one, since they did a head count. They didn't notice Kevin was gone during the head count because of the neighbor kid. Kevin *does* mention that Fuller wets the bed though, so they put Fuller in another room.

The look in his face is on edge the whole time he's talking to Harry. \n\nIf a cop came into your house and asked \"is this your house, sir\", wouldn't you be defensive? Wouldn't you wonder what was wrong?\n\n> Secondly, we never find out what he does. They don't mention where he works, or his background, or anything. \n\nWhat he does is irrelevant. This is Kevin's story, not Peter's.\n\n>why are they targeting that house specifically? \n\nBecause it looks to be one of the nicest in that neighborhood.\n\n>Kevin's mom is a cold emotionally dead bitch who says terrible things to her 8 year old son.\n\nNo she's not. She's a harried mom who is tired of dealing with Kevin's bullshit. If anything, that scene made Kevin look worse (like a brat) than his mom.\n\n>Buzz is a fucking psychopath\n\nBuzz is a typical older brother who picks on his younger siblings.\n\n>Uncle Franks is obviously a crook of some kind.\n\nUncle Frank is an asshole, but that doesn't make him a crook. If it did, Reddit would be full of criminals.\n\n>Then there's Kevin, who seems completely ok with killing two robbers. I don't think his intent was to \"bonk them on the noggin\". He was out for blood.\n\nHe's not killing anyone, unless slipping on Micro Machines and grasping a hot doorknob is being \"killed\".\n\n>Plus, the whole family has terrible manners. Just look at the scene when Kevin's mom is trying to use the pay phone in Paris and a woman is already using it. The whole family just muscles the poor woman off the phone. \n\nThey found out only a little while ago that their ~8 year old brother/son/nephew is sitting at home, alone, half a world away. Wouldn't you muscle some woman out of the way so that you could call the police and find out if he's OK?\n\nNot every movie has to be \"gritty\" and \"dark\".

I thought this was a good question. In the beginning of the movie, during the party, the dad throws away a single ticket. So even if the terminal lady did count the tickets to people, the number would be correct.\n\nWhy did Kevin have to go get a toothbrush from the store randomly? His mom must have packed his before they went on the trip, so he didn't have one. This led to him being called a thief and being chased by the police.\n\nWhy did Kevin use the cars as a way of knowing they were home if they used rental vans? Wouldn't he have known? I think that if they didn't lose power and sleep in, they would've taken their own cars. I'm not 100% sure though, since there is still nothing stopping them from taking their own cars. Nevermind, the taxi vans were waiting for them before they woke up.\n\nThe whole scene with Old Man Marley at church is recursive as fuck. Kevin tells him that the heater in the basement was scary but after going down there, he realized it was nothing. He was scared of Old Man Marley at first, but now he realizes that he is actually a nice old man. He then tells him that maybe if he calls his son, maybe it won't be that bad. He ends up seeing his grand daughter at the end of the movie. This idea of \"there's nothing to fear but fear itself\" basically occurs three times in this single scene, and it worked out each time.\n\nIf Kevin didn't mention that Fuller wets the bed, Fuller would've been left home with Kevin as well, but maybe they would've notice that two people were missing instead of one, since they did a head count. They didn't notice Kevin was gone during the head count because of the neighbor kid. Kevin *does* mention that Fuller wets the bed though, so they put Fuller in another room.

The look in his face is on edge the whole time he's talking to Harry. \n\nIf a cop came into your house and asked \"is this your house, sir\", wouldn't you be defensive? Wouldn't you wonder what was wrong?\n\n> Secondly, we never find out what he does. They don't mention where he works, or his background, or anything. \n\nWhat he does is irrelevant.

He wanted Luke to understand that they were powerful and to be mindful of it, but not fear it - especially not fear it. Imagine if you were an apprentice and were told there was nothing you could ever do to be a match for your opponent, no matter how hard you trained, yet you must confront them. Ouch.\n\n2.

Watching old behind-the-scenes footage of him just sitting behind a monitor...100 feet from the actual actors...sipping on his coffee...surrounded by people that are too afraid to question his ideas and just blindly go along with everything he does.... it just really makes me lament what could have been. \n\nThat was a long rant and I apologize.

Haha. I mean, he had valid points. It was pure Original Trilogy fan service. JJ and Lucasfilm played it very, VERY safe. However, I still absolutely loved it and I understood why they played it so safe. I mean...this Star Wars movie had to be good to restore the faith the prequels lost for a lot of fans. TFA was the best Star Wars since Empire, to me, even though it was basically A New Hope 1.5. \n\nAnother criticism of his that I'm not sure I agree with is the \"assembly line\" argument. He says that for the next few years, Disney and Co. will just churn out movies every year with absolutely no heart or soul put into them, much like how the MCU is being treated these days. They're more money-printing-vessels than works of art, I guess. But I think (or hope, rather) that people view Star Wars a little differently. People grew up with these movies and are absolutely in love with the Star Wars universe, and this includes the people Disney and Lucasfilm are putting in charge of writing and directing these new movies. Just look at the cinematography, sense of scale, and costume/set design from the Rogue One trailers. A lot of love is obviously being poured into that movie and I believe (...hope...) that this will be the trend for at least the first decade of new Star Wars movies. Coming back to Disney's treatment of the MCU, it even seems like those movies are getting much better after they put new people in charge. So with that being said, I at least believe that Disney have put together an exceptional assembly line for their movies hahaha. \n\nAnother thing Plinkett didn't like was having a new Star Wars movie every year. As long as they continue to be of the same quality of The Force Awakens and Rogue One (I guess it's still too early to really say for that one, but it does look great and my hopes are high) then I'm all for it. The one thing I feel iffy about is the Han Solo stand-alone...It just seems unnecessary. They're definitely just making that movie because Han is a very popular character and I'm interested to see where they take that one. \n\nOverall though, I'm pretty excited about the things coming to us in the near future. I'm betting that Episodes VIII and IX will be a bit riskier and we shall get a lot of cool \"Star Wars Story\" movies afterwards.

The thing is I don't feel the need for fan service, I could just watch A New Hope if I wanted episode IV nostalgia.\n\nI'd disagree with your points about Star Wars being different to Marvel though. Because Marvel have been in print for such a long time and have been in print consistantly, I'd argue that *more* people grew up loving Marvel than Star Wars, just because it was a presence for longer. Yeah Star Wars was still known after Episode VI, but there wasn't any mainstream content produced for it like there has been with Marvel. I don't even think the MCU films are getting better, they're staying at a steady 6/10, plain Jane, play it safe until it stops making money, which it won't for a long time. Again, the Rogue 1 trailers haven't really done anything for me, good set and costume design is a pound a penny these days, it's the writing and directing that helps seperate the wheat from the chaff and I just don't have faith in Disney to deliver that.\n\nIn regards to the movie a year thing, idk. If there's a reason to make a movie? Then yeah I'm all for that, if someone has a story they want to tell or wants to explore a part of the universe we haven't seen before then sure, but if they just do one a year for the sake of it then I'll be a little upset.\n\nI'll give the new episodes a go, seeing more of Luke might get me on board with the whole nostalgia hype.", "id": "d8x9kho"}, {"comment": "You could be right about Marvel. I know the comics have a very dedicated fan base, with some of them being fans for half a century. I could be absolutely wrong about what I'm about to say because I don't have any numbers to back it up, but comics have always seemed like a pretty niche thing to be in to. I personally only know like three people that read them occasionally and I don't know anyone that seriously follows more than one series. I do live in a place where stuff like comics and video games aren't very popular (good ol' Mississippi. I hate this state) so maybe my small little example isn't very good. But I do know that characters like Iron Man and Thor were considered \"B\" comic heroes before their movies, so the MCU has definitely boosted their popularity considerably. Star Wars always had books and video games and toys constantly coming out since Return of the Jedi, too, so there was stuff there to keep old fans interested and bring in new friends (admittedly a much smaller amount than a new movie would). All that being said, I kinda think Star Wars could be more popular than MCU...or at least pretty close in popularity.\n\nAlso, I haven't even seen all the MCU movies, so I'm really in no position to say if they're getting better or not. I have seen Civil War and Ant-Man recently and I do think they're much better than the last MCU movies I saw, which were Thor and Iron Man 2. \n\nThe way I see the movie-a-year thing and keeping stories fresh....They're not using the same people to write and direct all these movies. They bring in fresh minds of people that have been fans since they were children and I believe that's going to really help keep the franchise fresh and entertaining. \n\nI really don't see how you're not at least a little excited for Rogue One, especially after the \"making-of\" trailer. It looks great to me. I know cinematography and set design don't make a movie great, but I believe it is a great indicator to how much work and passion is being put into the movie and it does make me a little more hopeful that the writing and directing will be great. I don't know though, maybe I'm just too optimistic to the point of naivety. \n\nI would like to say that it is nice having a discussion like this, where we both disagree with each other, on reddit and one of us not resorting to calling the other a dumb faggot or something.

When more forms of entertainment became widely available they sort of fell out of favour (much like reading in general), but without a doubt they used to be absolutely huge. It's ironic you bring up Iron Man and Thor because they actually used to be two of the biggest and most profitable Marvel franchises, alongside Captain America, Spider-Man and the X-Men. Bare in mind, both of the characters you've mentioned (Iron Man and Thor) have been in publication since the early 60's, to sustain that sort of popularity you need serious staying power with a huge fan-base.\n\nI agree thought, I think all in all it's impossible to compare the popularity of Star Wars and Marvel, and it'd be fair to call them about even.\n\nI haven't seen them all either, and while I agree Ant Man had some novel ideas and actually did something different conceptually, that's because Marvel weren't producing it to be a huge hit, it was there to build the universe.

Vince wanted something Irish so he picked Hogan.  Terry had already been using \"The Hulk\" as a wrestling nickname for himself after he appeared on a talk show with Lou Ferrigno, star of The Incredible Hulk TV show.  The talk show host noticed that Terry was much bigger than Ferrigno so that's how he started going by \"Hulk\" or \"The Hulk\".  So Vince basically combined \"Hulk\" with \"Hogan\" and Hulk Hogan was born.\n\nHowever, when Hulk Hogan was just starting to become known to the public nationally, Marvel Comics contacted the then WWF to let them know they had a problem with his stage name.  Surprisingly they didn't have a problem with the name \"Hogan\" even though they had a character named Crusher Hogan; the name they had a problem with was \"Hulk\" because at the time The Incredible Hulk was one of Marvel's most popular characters, not only in comic books but also because of the aforementioned TV show.  So the WWF, specifically Titan Sports, had to pay Marvel licensing fees in order to use the name \"Hulk Hogan\" and \"Hulkster\".  If you don't believe me, look at any piece of Hulk Hogan merchandise and there will be a disclaimer somewhere on it saying the following: \"Hulk Hogan\" and \"Hulkster\" are trademarks of the Marvel Comics Group licensed exclusively to Titan Sports, Inc.  So it makes you wonder, considering how world famous Hulk Hogan became: did Marvel end up charging the WWF more and more money every year in order to continue using \"Hulk Hogan\" and \"Hulkster\" not only as names for a wrestler but also as a brand name printed on countless amounts of merchandise?  The WWE had been paying Marvel to use the \"Hulk Hogan\" and \"Hulkster\" names on and off since the late 70's.  That's almost 40 years worth of licensing payments.  Marvel must have made a fortune!

When he does return to his own time, he changed a lot of things in the past, but not enough things to change his own birth. He returns to the Lone Pines mall, and watches himself go back in time. \n\nNow here is where the problem lies. Marty (from the 'unaltered' timeline) went back in time and changed things, creating an altered future. If the Marty from the altered future goes back in time, he must run into the Marty from the unaltered timeline. \n\nYou can argue that if Altered Timeline Marty doesn't go back, then he can't knock down the tree for Lone Pine Mall, but that would mean that the time travel into the past is all **predetermined**, which is in direct contrast to how the movie is shot.\n\nIn a Predetermined time travel case, Unaltered Timeline Marty would have been at the Lone Pine Mall, but when he went back in time, it would have been the 'Twin Pine Farm' showing that Marty is the reason why the name changed, or showing the cause, but not changing the effect. \n\nInstead what we see is varying effects because Marty changed the cause. \n\n---\n\nSo why is this in direct contrast with your theory? Because Unaltered Timeline Marty starts living the life of Altered Timeline Marty. Altered Timeline Marty is somehow merged into Unaltered Timeline Marty, and if the movie followed Altered Timeline Marty, we would see everything in the way I described above and that everything was predetermined. \n\nThis covers everything except the knowledge that Altered Timeline Marty must have had about his truck.

Because Unaltered Timeline Marty starts living the life of Altered Timeline Marty.

The leader of the Empire is a powerful force user, so is his right-hand man. Vader *knew* the Death Star wasn't \"the ultimate power in the universe\". No, in my view, Vader and Palpatine knew the Rebels were capable of destroying the Death Star and purposely kept this information from Tarkin - he commanded too much respect in the Imperial Navy and likely could have performed a coup d'etat.

The Deathstar had no atmosphere, meaning that the port would be open the the vacuum of space.  Serious design flaw there.  They want to get rid of heat, not air, which is expensive to make.\n\n2. The vacuum of space is also extremely cold.  Unless there is a ton of insulation, heat will naturally leak off into space from all exposed surfaces of the Deathstar.  A problem most recently displayed on film in The Martian(the rovers). Insulation is a building cost and it takes up space, so you wouldn't want to over insulate it, then have to find a way to get rid of extra heat. Instead you would want to insulate it just enough to create a balance between heat generated internally and that which is leeched out into space.  If you need an exhaust system, it wouldn't be for heat, but for toxins like carbon monoxide, and they would use filters for that on a completely internal system.\n\n3. Heat equals power.  If you throw away heat into space, it's like throwing out perfectly good food in your home.  Any extra heat would be diverted for making electricity to create and filter water and air supplies.  Even the Stormtrooper feces is probably recycled.  (which casts some doubt on the whole ideas of a trash compactor being there as well).

Insulation is a building cost and it takes up space, so you wouldn't want to over insulate it, then have to find a way to get rid of extra heat. Instead you would want to insulate it just enough to create a balance between heat generated internally and that which is leeched out into space.  If you need an exhaust system, it wouldn't be for heat, but for toxins like carbon monoxide, and they would use filters for that on a completely internal system.\n\n3. Heat equals power.  If you throw away heat into space, it's like throwing out perfectly good food in your home.  Any extra heat would be diverted for making electricity to create and filter water and air supplies.  Even the Stormtrooper feces is probably recycled.  (which casts some doubt on the whole ideas of a trash compactor being there as well).

Any oxygen in the reactor would be burned off due to the immense heat long before it reached the port, creating Carbon Dioxide and Monoxide.\n\n2. Yes, space is cold. It's also empty, so there's no way for heat to leave the Death Star other than radiation. This is not nearly enough for the Death Star, which is spherical and therefore has a stable structure for a moon-sized station, but the absolute minimum surface area for heat loss. Your example of the Mars Rovers is completely irrelevant, as Mars has an atmosphere. A better example would be the International Space Station, which needs giant heat radiators to deal with its heat (and the ISS doesn't have the disadvantage of being the size of a moon and having nuclear reactors on board). The spacesuits used on the ISS also need a lot of cooling to counteract the body heat of the astronaut.\n\n3. The Death Star already has all the spare energy it needs.

This is what is known as \"cost-effective\".  Yes, they have a nice big and expensive hypermatter reactor to run and make heat, but fuel costs money and upkeep costs money.  They'll want to use as little fuel as necessary.\n\n3. - This is a hyperbolic statement.  You have no knowledge of hypermatter(not nuclear) fuel reserves on the Death Star, how they acquire that fuel or how often they can and do resupply.  They don't \"burn to a crisp\" for three reason.  First, that's just retarded.  Second, you don't just keep pumping out unneeded energy just like you don't keep your foot on the gas of a parked car.  You let it idle.

This \"exhaust\" air would contain Carbon Dioxide, Monoxide etc, but it would be oxygen from the reaction process. This would be very hot. Even if they could convert it back into 02 in industrial quantities, they be better off doing that in the habitable sections, as doing it with the \"exhaust\" air would leave very hot air lying around.\n\nTwo. I see the paragraph from your source that supports your argument\n> MLI insulation does a double-duty job: keeping solar radiation out, and keeping the bitter cold of space from penetrating the Station's metal skin.\n\n\nIf you bothered to read the very next one, you'd see it supports mine:\n\n>It does its work so well that the ISS presents another thermal challenge for engineers -- dealing with internal temperatures that are always on the rise inside this super-insulated orbiting laboratory fully stocked with many kinds of heat-producing instruments.\n\nThree. While I have no knowledge of hypermatter reactors, for the purpose of my argument they might as well be nuclear. Unless hypermatter somehow generates energy without generating heat? I very much doubt it. Unless the Death Star uses the Force, it needs to obey the laws of physics.\n\nThe Death Star WOULD burn to a crisp for three reasons. Firstly, that's not retarded, that's basic thermodynamics. If the Death Star doesn't get rid of it's heat, it will burn as it's full of oxygenated air in the habitable sections. Secondly, the Death Star's superlaser requires 24 hours to recharge. They wouldn't have much time to \"let it idle\". Thirdly, your last point just proves my point.

In LotR, the One Ring extends the ringbearer's life (potentially infinitely; people that are experts on the lore can correct me on that) so long as they are in possession of it.

This did happen. In the Old old days of the old republic jedi could have families (at least in the old EU) and their would be Jedi from famous families. In fact the main antagonist in the KOTOR comics is a jedi from one of these families. Also there were empires (discounting the small sith empires during the Galatic Dark Ages) that had a jedi at the head or at least the force in their bloodline. In the Tales of the Jedi series a group of jedi have to deal with one of these rules and a sith ghost. \n\nAlso just becasue someone has force strong parent's doesn't mean the kid will have it.

There's another thing you have to consider with the Skywalkers - the prophecy.\n\nNow, this is just my own personal theory and headcanon, but as I see it, Anakin Skywalker was the Chosen One, meant to fulfill the prophecy and restore balance to the Force. This is meant to be done by defeating all those who use the Dark Side of the Force, which is a cancerous imbalance as the Dark Side is the result of using the Force for your own ends, while the Light Side is using the Force as it is supposed to be used. If you want a see-saw analogy, the Light Side is sitting in the middle of the see-saw and letting it be balanced, while the Dark Side is sitting at one end of it so that it swings towards you.\nBecause Anakin was the Chosen One and the subject of prophecy, specifically meant to follow the will of the Force and restore balance, he was incredibly sensitive to it and very powerful with the Force. But, of course, at the end of the prequels, he wipes out the Jedi, becoming a Dark Side user.  \nThere are some people who believe that this was when he fulfilled the prophecy, balancing the Force by reducing the number of Light and Dark side users to 2 each (Obi-Wan and Yoda vs. Palpatine and himself). This is incorrect, not just because of the nature of the Dark Side vs. the Light but also for another reason which I'll go into later. I *do,* however, think that he was meant to wipe out the Jedi Order, which had become corrupt and no longer truly followed the will of the Force - more Dim than properly Light.  \nAnyway, with Anakin now a Dark Side user, who was the Force to turn to in order to fulfill its will? Who else but Anakin's children, Luke and Leia? The two of them were chosen by the Force to fulfill the prophecy as Anakin no longer listened to it. Leia was driven to attempt to topple the Empire as a whole, which would necessitate killing the Emperor and Vader (fulfilling the prophecy) - Luke didn't have as much ability, but still felt driven to leave Tatooine by any way he could, and became involved with the same struggle almost instantly. Luke ended up turning Anakin back to the Light, and Anakin fulfilled the prophecy by killing the Emperor and then dying. No more Sith, so no more users of the Dark side. The prophecy is complete.  \nBut why, then, is Ben Solo also so strong in the Force, and why does he feel such a pull to the Light side? And why is Rey, who might also be a Skywalker, so strong in the Force?  \nMy theory is that the prophecy isn't truly complete. There's still one more Dark side user out there. Supreme Leader Snoke, who has seen the Empire rise and fall. Snoke was around when Anakin reduced the Jedi Order to 2 - 2 Jedi and 3 Dark side users? That's not balance, even if it did mean Jedi vs. Dark siders. Snoke was around when Anakin and the Emperor died. His presence means that the prophecy is still incomplete. The onus of completing that is still on the Skywalker line, which, we are told, was created by the Force for the purpose of doing so. The Skywalker line is very strong with the Force, and will be until the prophecy is complete. Luke and Leia and Ben and possibly Rey all bear the burden of finishing what Anakin was meant to do.  \nMy finishing touch here on why I believe that the prophecy is incomplete and why a Skywalker (one in particular) will finish it in the new trilogy is a specific line, spoken by a Skywalker to Vader's helmet: \"I will finish what you started,\" says Ben Solo. I think you will.\n\nThis leads into my theory about Snoke being Plagieus, but that one has no evidence aside from the weight of the narrative.\n\nTL;DR I believe that the prophecy applies to all the Skywalkers, not just Vader, so they're not good evidence for Force-sensitivity being hereditary. Better evidence would be to find the EU material that probably exists about Ki-Adi-Mundi's children."], [10, "Should note that the Jedi are not celibate.

There's another thing you have to consider with the Skywalkers - the prophecy.\n\nNow, this is just my own personal theory and headcanon, but as I see it, Anakin Skywalker was the Chosen One, meant to fulfill the prophecy and restore balance to the Force. This is meant to be done by defeating all those who use the Dark Side of the Force, which is a cancerous imbalance as the Dark Side is the result of using the Force for your own ends, while the Light Side is using the Force as it is supposed to be used. If you want a see-saw analogy, the Light Side is sitting in the middle of the see-saw and letting it be balanced, while the Dark Side is sitting at one end of it so that it swings towards you.\nBecause Anakin was the Chosen One and the subject of prophecy, specifically meant to follow the will of the Force and restore balance, he was incredibly sensitive to it and very powerful with the Force. But, of course, at the end of the prequels, he wipes out the Jedi, becoming a Dark Side user.  \nThere are some people who believe that this was when he fulfilled the prophecy, balancing the Force by reducing the number of Light and Dark side users to 2 each (Obi-Wan and Yoda vs. Palpatine and himself). This is incorrect, not just because of the nature of the Dark Side vs. the Light but also for another reason which I'll go into later. I *do,* however, think that he was meant to wipe out the Jedi Order, which had become corrupt and no longer truly followed the will of the Force - more Dim than properly Light.  \nAnyway, with Anakin now a Dark Side user, who was the Force to turn to in order to fulfill its will? Who else but Anakin's children, Luke and Leia? The two of them were chosen by the Force to fulfill the prophecy as Anakin no longer listened to it. Leia was driven to attempt to topple the Empire as a whole, which would necessitate killing the Emperor and Vader (fulfilling the prophecy) - Luke didn't have as much ability, but still felt driven to leave Tatooine by any way he could, and became involved with the same struggle almost instantly. Luke ended up turning Anakin back to the Light, and Anakin fulfilled the prophecy by killing the Emperor and then dying. No more Sith, so no more users of the Dark side. The prophecy is complete.  \nBut why, then, is Ben Solo also so strong in the Force, and why does he feel such a pull to the Light side? And why is Rey, who might also be a Skywalker, so strong in the Force?  \nMy theory is that the prophecy isn't truly complete. There's still one more Dark side user out there. Supreme Leader Snoke, who has seen the Empire rise and fall. Snoke was around when Anakin reduced the Jedi Order to 2 - 2 Jedi and 3 Dark side users? That's not balance, even if it did mean Jedi vs. Dark siders. Snoke was around when Anakin and the Emperor died. His presence means that the prophecy is still incomplete. The onus of completing that is still on the Skywalker line, which, we are told, was created by the Force for the purpose of doing so. The Skywalker line is very strong with the Force, and will be until the prophecy is complete. Luke and Leia and Ben and possibly Rey all bear the burden of finishing what Anakin was meant to do.  \nMy finishing touch here on why I believe that the prophecy is incomplete and why a Skywalker (one in particular) will finish it in the new trilogy is a specific line, spoken by a Skywalker to Vader's helmet: \"I will finish what you started,\" says Ben Solo. I think you will.\n\nThis leads into my theory about Snoke being Plagieus, but that one has no evidence aside from the weight of the narrative.\n\nTL;DR I believe that the prophecy applies to all the Skywalkers, not just Vader, so they're not good evidence for Force-sensitivity being hereditary.

He visited Castelobruxo, the Brazilian school of magic, in South America.", "2016-02-08 06:16:52", 1171, "https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/44p29l/harry_potter_tom_riddle_didnt_disappear_as/", [[499, "Why is it that every other wizarding school has a special magical expertise and Hogwarts is like 'magic 101 come and sleep in classes you'll pass anyway'."], [103, "Whoa."], [60, "Question: if the curse had been contained in Dumbledore's hand, why did they not simply amputate it?"], [56, "This is interesting, but I think on further examination it falls apart pretty quickly. Most of the evidence doesn't really support the specific conclusions drawn from it, and the rest is mostly weak suppositions.\n\n**I-III**\n\nDippet served as headmaster from some indeterminate time (the wiki says early 20th century and sources *The Tales of Beedle the Bard, but I don't own a copy to verify*) until 1956 or 1957. At any rate, he lived well into his 300s and likely held the post for decades. The wiki says that Benedita was Headmistress in the 1940s/1950s, but the source lacks any sort of dating and is probably a guess based on the fact that Dippet is known by a cursory examination to have served during that period. There's a 50+ year period in which the visit could have taken place, and the fact that the attacks happened during that period doesn't indicate very strongly that the visit took place during the attacks.\n\nMore damning is Dumbledore's response to the crisis. He was absolutely confident that Aragog was not the monster, which is not the tact he'd taken if he needed someone to come figure things out. Furthermore, he knows without a doubt after Creevy is attacked that the culprit is a basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets. If Benedita was required to pin the source on a basilisk, she still wouldn't have been able to say so surely that it came from the Chamber. Dumbledore, then, seems to have things all figured out by himself. \n\nNow, his failure to issue a correction in this case does seem a bit cruel. But we can see full well that Dumbledore A. knew Hagrid was framed and B. couldn't prove it. Knowing the true culprit doesn't really change his moral stance. And it doesn't really do to release a statement that, wait a second, there's actually a thousand-year-old abomination stalking the castle which can kill you with a glance but we're *pretty* sure it's taking a nap for a bit and we apologize for the inconvenience. After all, Dumbledore is known to let simple things like honesty and forthcomingness fall by the wayside in his pursuit of the greater good. The case was closed because he had cowed Riddle into leaving the Chamber be, and had no expectation that another once-in-a-millannium figure like Riddle would be stopping by to open it back up any time soon.\n\n**IV**\n\nNagini's physical features are well-explained by the facts that A. She's a Horcrux, and B. We don't know all the different types of magical snakes that exist. The fact that Voldemort spent a lot of time in Albania is no accident, as Albania is home to a variety of snakes, some poisonous. It's implied he picked her up there, as she is first mentioned after his return from a visit to the country. For what it's worth, she also fits the description of a king cobra very closely.\n\nIt's best to assume that Nagini is *not* part basilisk, because the venom is clearly quite different. Basilisk venom is absurdly potent, sears through flesh and inanimate objects alike, can kill a person in minutes (as seen by its effects on Harry) and is the only substance we know of that can destroy the most well-made horcrux. Nagini's venom is... mostly an anticoagulent, apparently. Arthur is never really described as suffering from acute toxicity as much as just having giant bleeding holes punched through him. There's also never any mention of her gaze being anything special, and given that a basilisk petrifies things that view it indirectly, there's precedent for the sort of dilution of power that would at least see her have an affixing sort of stare.\n\n**V**\n\nI don't know what the purpose of bringing up all this evidence is when you just ignore the parts that flatly contradict you. We have zero reason not to believe that Herpo the Foul did indeed invent the basilisk by hatching a chicken's egg under a toad. It's kind of a silly notion that the procedure would, of all things, produce an exact copy of an otherwise naturally-evolved and extinct species. We also can't say that the basilisk is definitely aquatic in nature. The film shows the Chamber flooded because they didn't want to make the whole statue. It's described in the books as a bit dank, but there are no puddles or pools mentioned in the book, and the ground is dry enough for things to crunch loudly. There's no reason to suppose it is aquatic due to its size because other magical creatures (see: dragons) clearly violate the square-cube law that precludes any sort of major elephant acrobatics.\n\n**VI**\n\nNo problem, honestly. JK did fold a lot of her life experience into the series.\n\n**Putting it together**\n\nThere are a lot of tenuous conclusions resting on tenuous conclusions at work. While I think they are, obviously, tenuous at best, there's one thing that cleaves quite nicely through the whole Gordian knot: there is pretty much no mention of Brazil anywhere in the books. If Riddle had such important formative experiences there, wouldn't he be inclined to maybe put a horcrux there? Or even pay a little visit, once he had his body back? Voldemort was enamored with his own mythology, and he could not keep his fingers out of the pots he'd already stirred. Which just doesn't jive with the huge lack of mentions, thoughts, actions, rumors, visits, speculation, or any sort of mention in the narrative at all of the country.\n\nAlso, minor point, Castelbruxo being unplottable has no bearing on anything because, as you state right after, wizards can make themselves untraceable. \n\nAlso, also, this supposes that after Riddle had become Voldemort, nobody went around and said, hey, have you maybe seen this guy in the past couple decades? Any clues to what he's been up to that might help us out here? That, or the Brazilians supported the whole reign of terror thing after being shown to be at least amiable with Hogwarts (or, supposedly, a vital ally during the Chamber of Secrets crisis).\n\nIt's a fun mental exercise to put this all together, but there's absolutely no plausibility as an actual hypothesis."], [18, "Incredibly interesting theory and evidence!"], [18, "Unrelated to the theory, but \"Castelobruxo\" is a really silly name.

Like the spider-venom counterpart, as well, a major quantity of 'curse-toxins' had already proceeded up the arm, and were circulating throughout Dumbledore's body.\n\n> I had taken Snape's saying: 'I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being.' had merely applied to the visible signs of the curse upon Dumbledore and his hand.\n\n> I'd thought about why amputation hadn't been mentioned, too, but since Dumbledore and Snape hadn't talked about having Dumbledore reprise the famous old Celtic Magister's role, right down to the wearing of a precious-metal hand, I'd assumed the wound would inexorably continue to 'mummify,' no matter how high-up (how far from the 'mummy-hand') they chose to amputate.\n\n> I'd simply assumed it had been considered, and then rejected, and was not something I need to bother about. I'd been going under the assumption that, between the pair of them, Dumbledore and Snape had possessed vast magical repertoires. If they'd not followed a course of action, it was obviously not something worth my effort.\n\n> These men were the brightest and most cunning magic-wielders of their world; of ANY time. Between them, they had continually conducted Voldemort's actions, almost from the very beginning, even having discovering Voldemort's creation of an 'Inadvertent Horcrux.' They had done this even from beyond their graves, and their machinations had ultimately led to the destruction of Voldemort at the hands of the same 'Inadvertent Horcrux'.", "id": "czrvzli"}, {"comment": "Similar to the curse being \"contained\" in the ring, it may have some sort of mechanism where attempting to cut off the portion of the body it is affecting may trigger it to spread even further somehow, or move to a new host?", "id": "czrvu4m"}], [{"comment": "This is interesting, but I think on further examination it falls apart pretty quickly. Most of the evidence doesn't really support the specific conclusions drawn from it, and the rest is mostly weak suppositions.\n\n**I-III**\n\nDippet served as headmaster from some indeterminate time (the wiki says early 20th century and sources *The Tales of Beedle the Bard, but I don't own a copy to verify*) until 1956 or 1957. At any rate, he lived well into his 300s and likely held the post for decades. The wiki says that Benedita was Headmistress in the 1940s/1950s, but the source lacks any sort of dating and is probably a guess based on the fact that Dippet is known by a cursory examination to have served during that period. There's a 50+ year period in which the visit could have taken place, and the fact that the attacks happened during that period doesn't indicate very strongly that the visit took place during the attacks.\n\nMore damning is Dumbledore's response to the crisis. He was absolutely confident that Aragog was not the monster, which is not the tact he'd taken if he needed someone to come figure things out. Furthermore, he knows without a doubt after Creevy is attacked that the culprit is a basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets. If Benedita was required to pin the source on a basilisk, she still wouldn't have been able to say so surely that it came from the Chamber. Dumbledore, then, seems to have things all figured out by himself. \n\nNow, his failure to issue a correction in this case does seem a bit cruel. But we can see full well that Dumbledore A. knew Hagrid was framed and B. couldn't prove it. Knowing the true culprit doesn't really change his moral stance. And it doesn't really do to release a statement that, wait a second, there's actually a thousand-year-old abomination stalking the castle which can kill you with a glance but we're *pretty* sure it's taking a nap for a bit and we apologize for the inconvenience. After all, Dumbledore is known to let simple things like honesty and forthcomingness fall by the wayside in his pursuit of the greater good. The case was closed because he had cowed Riddle into leaving the Chamber be, and had no expectation that another once-in-a-millannium figure like Riddle would be stopping by to open it back up any time soon.\n\n**IV**\n\nNagini's physical features are well-explained by the facts that A. She's a Horcrux, and B. We don't know all the different types of magical snakes that exist. The fact that Voldemort spent a lot of time in Albania is no accident, as Albania is home to a variety of snakes, some poisonous. It's implied he picked her up there, as she is first mentioned after his return from a visit to the country. For what it's worth, she also fits the description of a king cobra very closely.\n\nIt's best to assume that Nagini is *not* part basilisk, because the venom is clearly quite different. Basilisk venom is absurdly potent, sears through flesh and inanimate objects alike, can kill a person in minutes (as seen by its effects on Harry) and is the only substance we know of that can destroy the most well-made horcrux. Nagini's venom is... mostly an anticoagulent, apparently. Arthur is never really described as suffering from acute toxicity as much as just having giant bleeding holes punched through him. There's also never any mention of her gaze being anything special, and given that a basilisk petrifies things that view it indirectly, there's precedent for the sort of dilution of power that would at least see her have an affixing sort of stare.\n\n**V**\n\nI don't know what the purpose of bringing up all this evidence is when you just ignore the parts that flatly contradict you. We have zero reason not to believe that Herpo the Foul did indeed invent the basilisk by hatching a chicken's egg under a toad. It's kind of a silly notion that the procedure would, of all things, produce an exact copy of an otherwise naturally-evolved and extinct species. We also can't say that the basilisk is definitely aquatic in nature. The film shows the Chamber flooded because they didn't want to make the whole statue. It's described in the books as a bit dank, but there are no puddles or pools mentioned in the book, and the ground is dry enough for things to crunch loudly. There's no reason to suppose it is aquatic due to its size because other magical creatures (see: dragons) clearly violate the square-cube law that precludes any sort of major elephant acrobatics.\n\n**VI**\n\nNo problem, honestly. JK did fold a lot of her life experience into the series.\n\n**Putting it together**\n\nThere are a lot of tenuous conclusions resting on tenuous conclusions at work. While I think they are, obviously, tenuous at best, there's one thing that cleaves quite nicely through the whole Gordian knot: there is pretty much no mention of Brazil anywhere in the books. If Riddle had such important formative experiences there, wouldn't he be inclined to maybe put a horcrux there? Or even pay a little visit, once he had his body back? Voldemort was enamored with his own mythology, and he could not keep his fingers out of the pots he'd already stirred. Which just doesn't jive with the huge lack of mentions, thoughts, actions, rumors, visits, speculation, or any sort of mention in the narrative at all of the country.\n\nAlso, minor point, Castelbruxo being unplottable has no bearing on anything because, as you state right after, wizards can make themselves untraceable. \n\nAlso, also, this supposes that after Riddle had become Voldemort, nobody went around and said, hey, have you maybe seen this guy in the past couple decades? Any clues to what he's been up to that might help us out here? That, or the Brazilians supported the whole reign of terror thing after being shown to be at least amiable with Hogwarts (or, supposedly, a vital ally during the Chamber of Secrets crisis).\n\nIt's a fun mental exercise to put this all together, but there's absolutely no plausibility as an actual hypothesis.", "id": "czs74il"}, {"comment": "Just to throw this out there. \n\nDo you believe it would be out of Voldemort's character to kidnap and take the place of a kid going to Castelobruxo?

It's definitely (at least Legends) canon that stormtrooper armor is pretty much the only armor worth wearing.\n\nSee, blasters came into popularity at some point in the SW universe, and armor that had been previously used was immediately made obsolete, as blasters punched through pretty much any kind of armor except very heavy metal (like titanium), and even then it was just a matter of getting enough energy in your shot to punch through that (e.g. bigger blasters on a ship could punch through steel and titanium, when a handheld blaster couldn't). Stormtrooper armor was light enough and durable enough to be worth wearing. While a blaster shot to the armor or side would be completely incapacitating normally, with stormtrooper armor it becomes something you can keep fighting through. This made them one of the strongest forces in the galaxy, despite what the movies depict (though there's a fan theory for that one too, I'm sure you know).\n\nSomewhat off topic:  \nAs a result, most fighters stopped wearing heavy armor completely, opting for lightweight setups (e.g. armors that had lightsaber resistant materials such as phrik, cortosis, or mandalorian iron) or being completely unarmored. This had a funny effect on some more savvy operators. As lightsabers are basically the only item able to regularly protect from a blaster bolt, \"slug throwers\", or conventional firearms as we would know them, started to see an uptick in use. Previously made obsolete by heavy trooper armor, an assassin armed with a slug thrower could assassinate a jedi or sith.

Mass on one end, it's a lever with a fulcrum on your hand.\n\nNow, imagine if you picked up a stick, and one end had little to no mass, but the fulcrum was the same. You'd be able to swing it, but applying your arm strength to that would feel weird, since the item has no real momentum of its own. All of the force that a lightsaber provides comes from you.\n\nAlso, let's not count out the idea that you can use the force to... create force.

It's definitely (at least Legends) canon that stormtrooper armor is pretty much the only armor worth wearing.\n\nSee, blasters came into popularity at some point in the SW universe, and armor that had been previously used was immediately made obsolete, as blasters punched through pretty much any kind of armor except very heavy metal (like titanium), and even then it was just a matter of getting enough energy in your shot to punch through that (e.g. bigger blasters on a ship could punch through steel and titanium, when a handheld blaster couldn't). Stormtrooper armor was light enough and durable enough to be worth wearing. While a blaster shot to the armor or side would be completely incapacitating normally, with stormtrooper armor it becomes something you can keep fighting through. This made them one of the strongest forces in the galaxy, despite what the movies depict (though there's a fan theory for that one too, I'm sure you know).\n\nSomewhat off topic:  \nAs a result, most fighters stopped wearing heavy armor completely, opting for lightweight setups (e.g. armors that had lightsaber resistant materials such as phrik, cortosis, or mandalorian iron) or being completely unarmored. This had a funny effect on some more savvy operators. As lightsabers are basically the only item able to regularly protect from a blaster bolt, \"slug throwers\", or conventional firearms as we would know them, started to see an uptick in use.
