Any person with a minute of training would know you turn with the gun: [Like this.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tfaIHjEG70A/TrdvyrDZ82I/AAAAAAAAA1Y/yICz8yjX3Uw/s1600/off-hand.JPG) If you take that position and switch to the left shoulder, the butt would be facing the picture. 2) Piper's position does not give demonstration for how the body is working. I'm no visual artist, but I can tell you that when you have people in specific positions you try to position them towards the shot to allow the audience to understand how they are moving or how they are stationary. Again, if Piper was mirrored here so she would be facing right, her left leg would be extended, her right leg would be the one more crouched and be detailed within the picture.

Or it's attacks, as you surmised.\n\nYour first comment was clearly not in the first category.\n\nBut now that you made clear that it wasn't your intent to attack and was just offering help, let's discuss your points;\n\nI concede point A, I kinda knew it looked wrong when I was done and took some time to look at the picture before to post it; However, living in Europe, we do not have access to gun training and I am not a person with \"any minute training\". Unless your \"training\" is Call of Duty, in which case, allow me to laugh. \n\nI wanted a twisted back pose, for at the moment it seemed a better idea that a full back shot; Was it the best idea? I don't think so. But it was fitting my composition and the general angle I wanted. I will however consider your point and think the pose more deeply for the following picture, and get more accurate references for the way to hold a riffle.\n\nAs for point 2, I don't agree; mostly because I didn't need people to see how her body was working; your point isn't necessarily wrong though, she would -probably- look better if she was in front view; she'd indeed be more detailed and her body positioning would -probably- look better. \n\nJust so you know, though. The gun is not the focus. Piper is not the focus. The backgound is not the focus. Giving less details to Piper was so she wouldn't be a focus.\n\nAnyway, I will keep those points in mind when doing the next sniper-type pose.", "id": "cxzl1ki"}, {"comment": "> However, living in Europe, we do not have access to gun training and I am not a person with \"any minute training\". Unless your \"training\" is Call of Duty, in which case, allow me to laugh.\n\nDoesn't take more than a minute to look up proper gun stances with a quick google search. You'll find hundreds of pictures, articles, and videos. I am from the Unites States, although I don't support guns I've had proper training because friends wanted to go hunting.\n\nLook, I understand artistic choice and the methods involved in creation. I'm not here attacking people, and I'm repeating this because it seems like you think that way. I saw the pic, knew something was wrong, and would have probably not commented on it until I saw someone else had. They saw something wrong and questioned **why**. So I answered that **why**. Whatever. Having faults in something, and people pointing out faults is no big deal. Can be annoying, but not a big deal.\n\nWhat is a big deal is when both the model and the artist can't take criticism. Understand that I'm an artist, I'm a writer, and I've worked with hundreds of other writers and have been attacked in revenge or otherwise expressed at length for some of my critiques for them. What they, and you, have yet to develop is **thick-skin**. Not all comments on a work is going to be overwhelmingly positive, or incredibly helpful. Not every single non-positive comment is worth the time and effort of addressing and explaining. If you see insight in someone's comments, *you don't have to address it*. And if you do, simply saying what you got from it (like in your last line) and a \"Thanks\" is the most you really need to do. You don't need to critique a critique to prove your point or express your intent of your work. That's a great way to waste a lot of time and effort on everyone's part.

Which is what I hoped. Well, shouldn't have expected anything to begin with.\n\nWhat annoy me generally with people like you is your patronizing tone. I took your critique into consideration and took the time to argument my point out of curiosity and here you are, throwing a fit and saying I either need to acknowledge your point or not reply at all. Point is, in the end of the day, *I don't care*, either way. Some of your points helped. Others won't.

It just reduces tracer to another bland female sex symbol.\n\nWe aren\u2019t looking at a Widowmaker pose here, this isn\u2019t a character who is in part defined by flaunting her sexuality. This pose says to the player base, oh we\u2019ve got all these cool diverse characters, but at any moment we are willing to reduce them to sex symbols to help boost our investment game.\n\nI have a young daughter that everyday when I wake up wants to watch the recall trailer again. She knows who tracer is, and as she grows up, she can grow up alongside these characters. What I\u2019m asking is that as you continue to add to the overwatch cast and investment elements, you double down on your commitment to create strong female characters. You\u2019ve been doing a good job so far, but shipping with a tracer pose like this undermines so much of the good you\u2019ve already done.", "id": "d7jgpmq"}, {"comment": "We're past this.... the new pose is slightly sexier", "id": "d7ji5j7"}, {"comment": ">what the fuck", "id": "d7jhfer"}, {"comment": "It's a meme", "id": "d7jhihn"}], [{"comment": "It's Hiiiiigh Poon.", "id": "d7jhvgn"}], [{"comment": "What...
