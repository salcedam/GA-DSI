Other times they make up excuses to grab their ass or their tits, it's pretty funny.\n\nOne clip comes to mind with Noel Easton and the camera guy wanted to rub paint on her tits, but she wasn't having it.  She was like ummmmmmm then he quickly recovered saying she could rub paint on her own tits instead lol, it was mad awkward.\n\nBut ya, these camera guys always try to feel up the girls.  Sometimes they just straight up ask if the girl minds if they touch their ass/tits.\n\nOther times they make up an excuse or slowly feel their way into it...like the camera guy will grab her clothing to start and adjust it/mess with it to feel her out and get her more comfortable.\n\nIt's funny you can always tell how thirsty the camera guys are for the girl, and then the male talent comes on set and starts grinding and kissing the girl.\n\nI've seen it where the girl was a bitch to the camera guy so then the male talent was extra rough with her cause she wouldn't let the camera guy touch her.\n\nBut ya, next time you watch these type of vids, pay attention to it, there is definitely a weird dynamic going on between camera man and porn star.\n\nEDIT:  What's probably the funniest, is when a camera guy is super desperate but the girl isn't having it at all and wont let him touch her, and then the male talent comes and the girl goes from \"eww camera guy\" immediately to making out/grinding/whatever...sometimes you can tell the camera guy is like, \"ya you bitch ass slut, wont let me touch you, so get deep throated into oblivion.  \n\nOr the camera guy will direct her to do unusual things or just constantly fuck with her...you know, those yappy as fuck camera guys that think they are Speilberg and shit.", "id": "d83pf4e"}, {"comment": "I have the weirdest boner after reading that", "id": "d83to8n"}, {"comment": "Good guy male talent looking after the camera bros.

And for what? So people who know HTML (a minority) can use it for text formatting? If you bothered to learn HTML, it's not that much of an ask to ask you to learn Markdown, it's not that difficult, and if you don't know HTML, putting stars around a string is much less work than putting <b> </b> or even style=\"font-weight:bold;\".

Because HTML can't be parsed by regex. Regex is not a tool that can be used to correctly parse HTML. As I have answered in HTML-and-regex questions here so many times before, the use of regex will not allow you to consume HTML. Regular expressions are a tool that is insufficiently sophisticated to understand the constructs employed by HTML. HTML is not a regular language and hence cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Regex queries are not equipped to break down HTML into its meaningful parts. so many times but it is not getting to me. Even enhanced irregular regular expressions as used by Perl are not up to the task of parsing HTML. You will never make me crack. HTML is a language of sufficient complexity that it cannot be parsed by regular expressions. Even Jon Skeet cannot parse HTML using regular expressions. Every time you attempt to parse HTML with regular expressions, the unholy child weeps the blood of virgins, and Russian hackers pwn your webapp. Parsing HTML with regex summons tainted souls into the realm of the living. HTML and regex go together like love, marriage, and ritual infanticide. The <center> cannot hold it is too late. The force of regex and HTML together in the same conceptual space will destroy your mind like so much watery putty. If you parse HTML with regex you are giving in to Them and their blasphemous ways which doom us all to inhuman toil for the One whose Name cannot be expressed in the Basic Multilingual Plane, he comes.

", "id": "d9hllle"}, {"comment": "**TL;DR:**  Type in \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af for proper formatting\n\nActual reply:\n\nFor the \n\n    \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nlike you were trying for you need three backslashes, so it should look like this when you type it out\n\n    \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nwhich will turn out like this\n\n\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af \n\nThe reason for this is that the underscore character (this one \\_ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy \\* ).  Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "d9hllp6"}, {"comment": "\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\n", "id": "d9hm6sl"}, {"comment": "Wow that was really informative.

And what would\u2019ve been stuck to the walls would\u2019ve probably been nothing. Just pieces of skin, bone, the brain of a robot, and what would have been left of a once huge and warm heart. Thank goodnees [sic] it never got to that point\".\n\nBrooke stated that she then briefly became involved with starring-in and producing female-only pornography, but that being the girl who \"tries to direct all girl features, but isn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d lesbian\" wasn't working. On her pregnancy, Brooke stated that she \"would never have a child and continue\" in the industry but that she was already \"done before finding out about\" it.

Put into the oven at 90C for what at least four hours.\n\nWhat you get is [inverted sugar syrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_sugar_syrup), or, more concretely, [halawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugaring_%28epilation%29). \n\nAdjust consistency by adding water or stirring while hot (which evaporates water just as boiling hotter does), cool off small portions to test. Should be barely kneadable at room temperature, becoming softer and applicable at skin temperature. YMMV depending on ambient temperature, humidity, and finally preferred technique. \n\nThe actual possible temperature span is  60C to 100C: The reaction (acid splitting the sucrose) needs at least about 60 degrees, and fructose starts to caramelise at 110. 90 degrees, at least for me, is sufficiently fast while keeping enough water inside the solution.\n\nDon't worry about messups, worst thing that can happen is that you spent a buck on a lesson on what not to do. Oh: Don't let hot sugar ever touch your skin. It may even be colder than water but as it sticks you *will* get a nasty burn, expect at least second-degree (that is, blisters).\n\nApply against the grain, pull with the grain. That's the opposite of waxing, and one of the reason it's gentler (not that it doesn't hurt at all). The other two are that the sugar molecules are actually small enough to get in between the skin and the root, and last but not least the sugar doesn't really stick to the skin. \n\n\n\nAnd yet another nice thing: You can just wash it off with warm water.\n\n---\n\nOf course, that doesn't fix the awkward position problem but it fixes the money and having to do it all the time ones. Also, get your SO to do it.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention cornstarch (or, more expensively, baby powder): Use just enough to dry the skin so the sugar doesn't get humid as fast, you can re-use one glob again and again until it's more hair than sugar.

Trimming beforehand helps with that, though grip becomes an issue if they're shorter than about 1cm.

Produces adrenaline (YMMV), which helps.\n\nTouching up is much easier, then, both because young hairs aren't nearly as thick and also because (or at least so the legend goes) the lemon in the stuff makes them grow thinner.\n\nIf it helps, a consolidation: At any time, you're actually only taking out about 30% of the hair as the rest of the follicles aren't in their growth or shed cycle, but resting.

Your mindset is all wrong. From the way you're typing it's easy to tell you would much rather blame other people or your circumstances than do what you can with what you have. \n\nSaying you want to cuddle with a girl like that with a frowny face is a pathetic thing to do and you will not garner sympathy, people will only look down on you.\n\nI know about the just world fallacy but that's more relevant to things like bullying, abuse, rape, etc. This seems more like a case of \"boo hoo pity me I can't get a supermodel to cuddle.\"\n\nI don't mean to be rude but I'm giving you the truth, when you act like that then you're kind of bringing it on yourself.
