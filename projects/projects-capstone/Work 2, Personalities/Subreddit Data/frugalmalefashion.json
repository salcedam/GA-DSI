But daily wear will kill them in maybe a year if you're lucky. But that's not the point\n\nFor me I'll instead buy 5 pairs of pants in different styles and colors for the same price of 1 quality pair. And now I can mix and match different looks a and outfits with  my choices... And the best part... They will last just as long as the one quality pair because I'm not wearing them every day...

I do not review fashion, because I'm generally not a fashionable man.   I was a bit worried because the sizing info was a bit scattered, and I didn't know what to expect.  I had ordered a large because that's what I wear in a J Crew, but I wear medium in some gap, but a large in other gap.  \n\nI'm an average dude that has a gut, which I am trying to suck in, in the photo.   I'm 6ft tall, about 182, a 34-36 in jeans, chinos, whatever the hell.  I wear a 35 in Jomers wools, and a 35 in their chinos, but I'm really pushing it and should probably wear a 36 in the chinos.  Anyway...\n\nWhile I don't review fashion, I do operate a gear review channel on Youtube, so I hopefully the photos and my sizing give a good indication on how this fits on my body.  And I apologize, I should have rotated a few of the pictures before I uploaded to Imgur.  I had thought there would have been an option in the app to do so, but I couldn't locate it.  \n\nThe sweatshirt I ordered is a large, and while it can be debated if I got the right size... I really like the fit.  It is a sweatshirt, so I don't want it to hug my body.  Sweaters and sweatshirts often ride up on me, because I have a big ass- this one is heavyweight and the waist rib is loose and flexible... it rides a little but not much.  The sleeves are just a hair too long for my arms, but I feel that's kind of nitpicking.  \n\nThe fabric says midweight, and I guess I agree?  It's not thin, but it's warm and a good thickness.  Also it's soft.  Not fleece soft, but still feels nice to the touch.  The interior of the fabric has bigger loops, again not fleecy- but I would call it a tad rougher to the touch than the exterior.  \n\nAll and all I'm happy with the weight, the fit, and the quality.  It was under $30 shipped, and it looks like it should last for years.  Time will tell how much it shrinks or how it holds up to use and wash, but I don't see any initial QC problems.  Plus there's just enough room, that if it shrinks I should still be ok. When this eventually drops again, hopefully it will be available in more colors.  I'm pretty sure its my new favorite sweatshirt.  Hope this review was up to FMF standards.  Feel free to ask me any questions.  Also here is a plug for my Youtube channel, for no reason.  I'm nearing 2000 subscribers!

I do not review fashion, because I'm generally not a fashionable man.   I was a bit worried because the sizing info was a bit scattered, and I didn't know what to expect.  I had ordered a large because that's what I wear in a J Crew, but I wear medium in some gap, but a large in other gap.  \n\nI'm an average dude that has a gut, which I am trying to suck in, in the photo.   I'm 6ft tall, about 182, a 34-36 in jeans, chinos, whatever the hell.  I wear a 35 in Jomers wools, and a 35 in their chinos, but I'm really pushing it and should probably wear a 36 in the chinos.  Anyway...\n\nWhile I don't review fashion, I do operate a gear review channel on Youtube, so I hopefully the photos and my sizing give a good indication on how this fits on my body.  And I apologize, I should have rotated a few of the pictures before I uploaded to Imgur.  I had thought there would have been an option in the app to do so, but I couldn't locate it.  \n\nThe sweatshirt I ordered is a large, and while it can be debated if I got the right size... I really like the fit.  It is a sweatshirt, so I don't want it to hug my body.  Sweaters and sweatshirts often ride up on me, because I have a big ass- this one is heavyweight and the waist rib is loose and flexible... it rides a little but not much.  The sleeves are just a hair too long for my arms, but I feel that's kind of nitpicking.  \n\nThe fabric says midweight, and I guess I agree?  It's not thin, but it's warm and a good thickness.  Also it's soft.  Not fleece soft, but still feels nice to the touch.  The interior of the fabric has bigger loops, again not fleecy- but I would call it a tad rougher to the touch than the exterior.  \n\nAll and all I'm happy with the weight, the fit, and the quality.  It was under $30 shipped, and it looks like it should last for years.  Time will tell how much it shrinks or how it holds up to use and wash, but I don't see any initial QC problems.  Plus there's just enough room, that if it shrinks I should still be ok. When this eventually drops again, hopefully it will be available in more colors.  I'm pretty sure its my new favorite sweatshirt.  Hope this review was up to FMF standards.  Feel free to ask me any questions.  Also here is a plug for my Youtube channel, for no reason.  I'm nearing 2000 subscribers!  Watch one video and you'll be hooked.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/mhanlen1\n\nAlso I wear clothes in the videos, so you can get a better idea of my body type.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-FUh_imdtQ", "id": "cz0hkog"}, {"comment": "Thanks a ton for the write up!

I'm sure a medium will fit fine on you. Your body type should be about the same as mine and in my experience I'm right in between M and L at most retailers in their shirts. I usually prefer to go up to an L if say the item is 100% cotton and I know it'll shrink a little. This enables me to get a perfect fit and not worry about wearing a medium (which I fill out) shrinking.\n\nThis method also applies to the slim ocbd's from JCrew, etc. Mediums are a little snug on me in the shoulder area (some people say that's how a shirt should fit) I prefer a little more relaxed fit and not restrict my range of motion when I reach over my head/give someone a hug. \n\nThe main thing is you don't want the fit to be baggy/have too much excess fabric.

I really like the fit, I think it's pretty flattering. I'm 5'10 about 170 with a 37\" chest or so and went with an S. Length was good, nothing was overly tight. \n\nThe stitching seems good, but not great, material is the same. I understand it's raglan sleeves, but something about feel just clearly isn't as good.\n\nIn comparison to PL, the material difference is a big deal. French terry is just so different from raglan that it's hard to compare. PL's stitching was much cleaner and the cotton feels better woven together. Nothing wrong with the Jomers sweat, but it feels like the material was stretched pretty thin. \n\nThat being said, the Jomers sweat was quite warm. I felt very comfortable without a jacket in 35-40 degree temperatures. Pistol Lake's hoodie isn't as warm, but it's also more of a luxury comfort sweat that I work out in. It isn't what I laze around in. They're just different beasts in my opinion. I still would take PL over Jomers, but they serve different purposes.\n\nFinally, compared to RC, it's just blown out of the water. I definitely understand that 28 dollars is much easier of a pill to swallow than whatever MSRP RC has. I haven't gotten any of my stuff at full value, I've gotten good end of season sales. Still usually $60 bucks or so, so twice the cost of the Jomers sweat. I would pay that 100% of the time. \n\nThe difference is clear in literally every aspect. The stitching is cleaner, the fabric feels better to the touch, the fit is similar good, while Jomers keeps me warm, the RC keeps me comfortable. More than just warm. The material looks nicer from the outside looking in as well.\n\nI may go more in depth as I get more time with the Jomers sweat, but I'm happy to add it to my wardrobe, but I wouldn't pick it over RC and depending on my needs PL either.", "id": "cz1sxxx"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the review.

I think people get too caught up in what \"fit\" is. One extreme is that people think slim is skin tight and anything else is unacceptable/poor fit. Slim in my opinion is not too much excess material, but still comfortable. I don't mind a little drape here and there and the benefits of comfort for me far outweigh the gained aesthetic (minor imo). \n\nSecondly, some people just have larger/longer torsos than others. I have an athletic build (wide chest/shoulders) long arms (34) and a long torso for my height. My upper body is closer to someone around 6'0 and maybe 15 more pounds. Contrarily, my inseam is only a 30... So the bottom line is learn your measurements and compare your body type to the \"average person\" to guesstimate your size when ordering.

Ive already paid off my student loans so frugality is still important to me, but isn't essential anymore. \n\nI lost my old Nixon watch a few months ago and figured I would find a replacement today, seeing that it is cyber Monday.  I've come across amazing deals for Raymond Weil watches. Normally they go for $1200-3000 depending, but everything is 65-85% off bringing it into the $400-800 range. Go to amazon and search Raymond Weil to see what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone in this sub has any knowledge about the RW brand and if it's worth it to pull the trigger on one of these.

I do have a RW watch, but never wear it.  Not exactly my taste, but that's a personal preference.  Going from a Nixon to a RW watch would be a great upgrade, but it depends which one.  You can find some quartz RW watches for a few hundred on the used market.  I'd suggest upping to an automatic for the price you are looking for.  Also, beware of what things list for.  MSRP is rarely offered, unless they are early adopters of a specific model at an AD (authorized dealer) and even those are not always at MSRP.\n\nPersonally, hold off.  Save your bucks.

Keep the patterns minimal; in professional work environments (that require ties) you don't normally see people wearing large splashes of bright colors or flamboyant floral patterns. Stripes of similar colors (e.g. lighter blue on navy) work well when the stripe occupies the same or less space as the base color. If you want to incorporate more different colors, I suggest keeping the brighter, more noticeable color constrained to a smaller portion of the tie (e.g. silver dots on black or navy tie). I believe a tasteful way of executing patterns and breaking up the monotony of solid ties is to use fabric to your advantage - some ties are made of materials or woven in such a way that brings natural texture (i.e. wool, knit, etc.) If you grow bored of traditionally black, blue, or grey ties, try using dark/forest green or burgundy (again, emphasis on darker shades), they'll still sufficiently match your suits without sticking out like eyesores.
