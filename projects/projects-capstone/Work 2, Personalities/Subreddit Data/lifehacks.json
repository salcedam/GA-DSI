It's normal to have the same feeling with multiplication and division. Most feel it with squares and square roots, but for some reason, logarithms seem to confusingly pop out of nowhere with no counterpart. The missing counterpart is actually exponentiation, but a specific form of exponentiation. n-th roots are the counterparts to exponents of the form x^n, but logarithms are counterparts to exponents of the form n^x, where x is the variable and n is the constant.\n\nWith this in mind, all these operations can be thought of as trying to **one** of these four questions:\n\n1. Where do we start?\n* Where do we end?\n* What is our step?\n* How many steps (count)?\n\nFor an operation (addition, multiplication, etc.) to be solvable, three of the four questions must be known beforehand. A \"counterpart\" of one operation is simply a matter of changing which of the four questions is the unknown: the answers to each question do not change! Consider this table, where we solve for the right side:\n\n | a + b = c | c - a = b | Solution\n:- | :-: | :-: | :-\nStart | a | a | If we start at a...\nEnd | ??? | c | and want to get to c...\nStep | +1 | +1 | using +1 per step...\nCount | b | ??? | it will take b steps.\n\nThe same holds for multiplication and division:\n\n | a * b = c | c / a = b | Solution\n:- | :-: | :-: | :-\nStart | 0 | 0 | If we start at 0...\nEnd | ??? | c | and want to get to c...\nStep | +a | +a | using +a per step...\nCount | b | ??? | it will take b steps.\n\nThe question then is this: what is the counterpart to exponentiation? You would think it's nth roots, but that's not necessarily the case! According to the pattern above, logarithms is actually the more appropriate counterpart:\n\n | a^b = c | log_a c = b | Solution\n:- | :-: | :-: | :-\nStart | 1 | 1 | If we start at 1...\nEnd | ??? | c | and want to get to c...\nStep | *a | *a | using *a per step...\nCount | b | ??? | it will take b steps.\n\nLogarithms are trying to answer the question of \"how many steps does it take\" to get from 1 to c when doing *a per step, just like subtraction and division. What about nth roots then? Roots are actually the odd one out of these, because unlike addition or multiplication, exponentiation is not commutative, so a^b is not equal to b^a. In the questions above, you could have switched a and b without problems, but not so for exponentiation. This means there is a third question we can solve for with respect to exponentiation, and that is question #3: \"what is the step?\".\n\n | a^b = c | ^(b)\u221ac = c^(1/b) = a | Solution\n:- | :-: | :-: | :-\nStart | 1 | 1 | If we start at 1...\nEnd | ??? | c | and want to get to c...\nStep | *a | ??? | using *a per step...\nCount | b | b | it will take b steps.\n\nI believe this may be a reason why logarithms trip people up when they first see them. Not only is the notation unusual (we're using words?!), but you've been tricked into thinking that roots are the sole counterpart to exponentiation, when due to non-commutativity, an additional counter-operation is introduced.

To do 15 divided by 3, you add 3 to itself until you get 15: \n\n    3 = 3\n    3+3 = 6\n    3+3+3 = 9\n    3+3+3+3 = 12\n    3+3+3+3+3 = 15\n\nThis means that 5\\*3 = 15, or 15 divided by 3 is 5. We can say this in another way, we want to find how many times we have to add 3 to itself to get 15 but repeated addition is multiplication, so what we *really* want to do is solve the equation 3x=15. \"Three times what is fifteen?\" We then use the picture \"15/3\" to denote whatever number is the solution to this equation, and we just saw that 15/3=5.\n\nWe can do all this, but instead of using repeated addition, use repeated multiplication. How many times do I have to multiply 2 by itself to get 64?\n\n    2 = 2\n    2*2 = 4\n    2*2*2 = 8\n    2*2*2*2 = 16\n    2*2*2*2*2 = 32\n    2*2*2*2*2*2 = 64\n\nSo we have to do it 6 times. Since repeated multiplication is just exponentiation, what we *really* want to do is solve the equation 2^(x)=64. Just as we use the picture \"15/3\" to denote the number that solves 3x=15, we use the picture \"log_2(64)\" to denote the number that solves 2^(x)=64. In this case, as we just saw, log_2(64)=6.\n\nIf you want to understand logs, try thinking about division.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe external angles one is *not* illustrating what it says it is.

The Fethurblewer then directs a gentle zephyr of heated air towards the lucky duck, quickly drying him.  The Duckherd again takes the lead and the small procession heads down the ramp to the Plukencouch.

Ever so gently Helga and Holga pluck only the finest feather from the under down of the pampered eiders using a double twist technique handed down from mother to daughter over at least a thousand years.  The feathers are immediately hermetically sealed into handcrafted cedar chests specially purchased from a Lebanese monastery.

Barclays also lost a lot of customers as people confused by the new charge thought they'd get charged for using their own banks ATM.  \nThe whole thing looked very bad for them, so they folded, removing the extra fee, and in an effort to win back customers promised to wave all ATM fees for a year.  \nEvery other bank dropped their ATM fees to compete, and no bank wants to be the one to bring them back as few people in the UK know it wasn't always like this.\n\nSo a temporary act to try and save Barclays from losing too many customers and win back some good faith effectively saved the average person about \u00a360/year (assuming 1 transaction per week at the most common ATM fee of \u00a31.25).", "id": "cz8bfws"}, {"comment": "Very interesting, thanks for the share.\n\nDoes the average person really go to a competitor's ATM once per week?

Buying a good vacuum is absolutely true and you have no idea how much money you save yourself in the long run.\n\nWe used to charge $0.35 per square foot, that worked out to about $1000 per average-sized house to do good carpet cleaning because all of our competitors did shit work. \n\nThe number one problem was that most people didn't vacuum properly, so they had to get their carpets cleaned every few years and they were always filthy.\n\n* Never ever buy a bagless vacuum. Just don't. Buy a good one with HEPA filtration (or S-class if you're in Europe).\nBuy one that is warrantied for commercial work. That means it is made of quality parts. Even brands on the cheaper side like Sanitaire and Eureka will work fine if they are the true commercial line. Just don't buy ones that say \"professional\" but are actually marketed towards residential: they will break down in a year if you use it more than once per week.\n\n(I do not, personally, recommend using a commercial vacuum in your home, but rather, a premium residential vacuum.)\n\n* Properly adjust the brush roller so that the bristles sweep the carpet, not dig into it. The tips of the bristles should just barely touch the bottom of the pile and it should offer no resistance.\n* Change the bag regularly. Just buy them in bulk for a year, you should get them for about a dollar per bag.\n\n(This depends greatly upon vacuum type chosen, and bag capacities of various vacuums. This can vary greatly, but remain cost effective)\n\n* Never wear shoes in your house, and if you have pets vacuum at least twice as often. Also vacuum after every event.\n* If liquid is spilled on carpets clean it up immediately. Keep putting dry towels down and stand on them, then put a fan on the damp spot.\n* If you must clean them, hire a professional (not Stanley Steamer) to clean them using extraction. Shampooing is a last resort for very heavy soil, and should always be followed by extraction. Never hire coupon cleaners, or anyone that doesn't have a license & insurance.\n* If you insist on cleaning your own carpets, never use a Rug Doctor or any carpet cleaning machine that is rented out by chain retail stores, you might as well use a shop vac and a water hose. Go to a janitorial supplier and rent a professional extractor, RTFM, and vacuum your carpets completely before you extract. You can rent an air mover or just buy some cheap box fans but either way you need to dry your carpets completely after extraction.\n* Listen to everything /u/touchmyfuckingcoffee [+10] says about selecting and caring for your vacuum. He knows his stuff.\n\nDo all that and your carpets will never need cleaning, you'll save yourself a crapload of money and your house will be healthier too.\n", "id": "d1hnc10"}], [{"comment": "There was this rubber broom for this very purpose I can't remember the name though but it's awesome ", "id": "d14har3"}], [{"comment": "Also: rubber gloves to get fur off upholstery.", "id": "d14jl5u"}], [{"comment": "Perhaps that's just 2 days' worth of cat hair?", "id": "d14j7pe"}], [{"comment": "Running a cat brush lightly over a rug will find a lot as well..\n[http://www.amazon.com/Safari%C2%AE-Cat-Self-Cleaning-Slicker-Brush/dp/B000YIWUXI/](http://www.amazon.com/Safari%C2%AE-Cat-Self-Cleaning-Slicker-Brush/dp/B000YIWUXI/)", "id": "d14okkh"}], [{"comment": "Gets my dogs fur off the cloth seats in my car as well.

You've chosen to run with a particular method of making money which relies on other people doing what you want them too. They've decided that they don't want to do that. Your response is to get pissy about it instead of realizing that the method of making money that you bought into doesn't actually work, and switching to something else.\n\nIt's got nothing to do with morality, or whether that method works for other people, or whether you or anyone else think that it *should*, or even what your opinion is about whether one thing is better than another. The fact of the matter remains that it isn't working for your particular situation, and you don't have a way of forcing it to work. Effectively, the system you are attempting to use involves you having to continually guilt or berate people into giving you money, and they're not responding to that.\n\nAnd yes, maybe in the end people won't get your content any more because you'll have shut up shop. You're presenting that as an ultimatum. But that's only an ultimatum from your perspective - most internet users won't even notice that you're gone; they'll just use the 9000 other sites which do the same thing you do.\n\nNot trying to disparage whatever it is you do, just looking at what you're saying, which is that putting advertising on your site isn't bringing in enough money for you to keep going.\n\nIt happens. The landscape changes. Things which were profitable once aren't guaranteed to be forever. Rather than railing at people for not wanting their screens filled with ads, wouldn't it make more sense to look for one or more alternative income streams?

Best part is, it's pretty customizable about how you truly organize things, and just feels really nice to have. I have used it numerous times to find random information, whether it be recent, or further in the past that otherwise would have required excessive digging through all kinds of materials.\n\nI have even be using it to store my class notes, and it's quite nice to be able to pull up my notes and even search through them easily. Evernote has a camera function for your phone, and it does a pretty good job of capturing your notes and other things, especially paper notes it'll usually do a good job of adjusting the lightning for them.\n\nDid I mention it's all synced in a cloud?

Obviously the exact sizing of the media used in this filter is important. \n\nIn sand filters used by municipalities/anyone reducing water turbidity the media layering should be 1/4\" x 1/8\" gravel -> 0.8 mm - 1.2 mm torpedo sand -> 0.45 mm - 0.55 mm sand (bottom -> top). This explains the crude can filter that is pictured however municipal sand filters also add another type of media on top of the sand, 0.8 mm - 1.0 mm anthracite.\n\nAs you astutely pointed out the no further filtration would occur after the fine sand, and if the fine sand were allowed to be the only means of filtration it would quickly plug and foul. The addition of an anthracite cap allows for coarser particles and coagulated matter to be filtered out earlier leaving the fine sand to filter out fine particles only.\n\nTL;DR You are right to an extent, but the media order described is used as a scaffolding to hold the fine sand instead of for actual filtration.\n\nSource: Work at a company that manufactures and sells water filtration equipment.

Luckily my dog was born during the end of April so he was still quite young in July and exposing him came naturally. I was able to just play with him in my front yard during the fireworks, with a long lead just in case. I gave him some treats when the fireworks got louder and kept playing fetch. Since then 2 more dogs have lived with my dog and his demeanor absolutely set the tone for the other two younger dogs. The most I've seen them react to a firework is looking around after the first few loud ones of the season. \n\nAn older dog's first reaction to unknown stimuli is fear or aggression. A young dog's first reaction is curiosity. By exposing them to a lot at a young age you are giving them enough knowledge to recognize new stimuli they encounter later in life as variations of what they have already experienced. This allows your dog to go through their life less fearful, less aggressive, less stressed, more curious, and to have overall more positive experiences. \n\nI got very lucky with my dogs natural demeanor and the timing of his birth. But more importantly I worked very hard to expose him to as much as possible at a young age. I took him to dog parks when he was young, I took him to friend's houses (with their permission), I took him to parks and felt extremely strange as I was literally trying to get little kids to pet my puppy (talk to parents first and explain why), he went to college parties (again, with permission and before the music got too loud), he went for walks downtown, walks through the woods, was exposed to the sound of gunfire, busy cities, etc., etc., etc. Exposing your dog to as much as possible before they are 4 months old is critical. Yes - I took some risks by having him in dog parks and in the woods before he completed all of his shots and vaccinations. But socialization is paramount for a dog.\n\nI realize that this is not possible if you adopt an older dog. But you can still try to create a positive experience. Most important is that you need to remain very calm. Stick to your normal routine with the dog so they aren't already on edge - but plan on being indoors when the fireworks start to be safe and to somewhat muffle the sound of the fireworks. Don't hide in a room you don't normally hang out in. When your dog hears the fireworks give them an awesome treat - actual meat or cheese if they aren't allergic. Continue to treat and play with your dog during the fireworks.\n\nIn cases where your dog is so freaked out that they won't even respond to treats or affection you should speak with your vet about medication. You may be against the use of medication but please consider how stressed and/or terrified your dog must feel to decline their favorite treats and retreat under the bed or run away from home. It will help them quite a bit if they can be more relaxed - and it will allow you to turn it into a more positive experience via positive reinforcement that their more calm demeanor will now allow.

Luckily my dog was born during the end of April so he was still quite young in July and exposing him came naturally. I was able to just play with him in my front yard during the fireworks, with a long lead just in case. I gave him some treats when the fireworks got louder and kept playing fetch. Since then 2 more dogs have lived with my dog and his demeanor absolutely set the tone for the other two younger dogs. The most I've seen them react to a firework is looking around after the first few loud ones of the season. \n\nAn older dog's first reaction to unknown stimuli is fear or aggression. A young dog's first reaction is curiosity. By exposing them to a lot at a young age you are giving them enough knowledge to recognize new stimuli they encounter later in life as variations of what they have already experienced. This allows your dog to go through their life less fearful, less aggressive, less stressed, more curious, and to have overall more positive experiences. \n\nI got very lucky with my dogs natural demeanor and the timing of his birth. But more importantly I worked very hard to expose him to as much as possible at a young age. I took him to dog parks when he was young, I took him to friend's houses (with their permission), I took him to parks and felt extremely strange as I was literally trying to get little kids to pet my puppy (talk to parents first and explain why), he went to college parties (again, with permission and before the music got too loud), he went for walks downtown, walks through the woods, was exposed to the sound of gunfire, busy cities, etc., etc., etc. Exposing your dog to as much as possible before they are 4 months old is critical. Yes - I took some risks by having him in dog parks and in the woods before he completed all of his shots and vaccinations. But socialization is paramount for a dog.\n\nI realize that this is not possible if you adopt an older dog. But you can still try to create a positive experience. Most important is that you need to remain very calm. Stick to your normal routine with the dog so they aren't already on edge - but plan on being indoors when the fireworks start to be safe and to somewhat muffle the sound of the fireworks. Don't hide in a room you don't normally hang out in. When your dog hears the fireworks give them an awesome treat - actual meat or cheese if they aren't allergic. Continue to treat and play with your dog during the fireworks.\n\nIn cases where your dog is so freaked out that they won't even respond to treats or affection you should speak with your vet about medication. You may be against the use of medication but please consider how stressed and/or terrified your dog must feel to decline their favorite treats and retreat under the bed or run away from home. It will help them quite a bit if they can be more relaxed - and it will allow you to turn it into a more positive experience via positive reinforcement that their more calm demeanor will now allow.

Best thing you can do for yourself is to learn how to say \"no\" firmly and without hesitation.\n\nBest place to start is at the airports. If you're flying into JFK (John F. Kennedy airport) outside there is a little booth with the trademark yellow cabs parked alongside it. There will be a line; if you need to get a cab to get where you're going: get in that line. While you walk towards that line you will be approached by multiple people (most likely one at a time.) They will inform you that they have a cab or car parked just down the way, no wait, with better fares.

This went on for the rest of the walk and there were multiple times  when vendors called me a liar because I said no, no bears for me.

Best thing you can do for yourself is to learn how to say \"no\" firmly and without hesitation.\n\nBest place to start is at the airports. If you're flying into JFK (John F. Kennedy airport) outside there is a little booth with the trademark yellow cabs parked alongside it. There will be a line; if you need to get a cab to get where you're going: get in that line. While you walk towards that line you will be approached by multiple people (most likely one at a time.) They will inform you that they have a cab or car parked just down the way, no wait, with better fares. Best case scenario: they were lying about the fares and they'll have jacked up fares and take you the long way. Worst case scenario: you end up a new plot for Law and Order: SVU.\n\nThe Yellow Cabs of New York may not be the best cab service in the city, but there are a lot of car services in NYC and unless you're a native you won't know the best to choose from out of them all.

I would be in a store and a guy would come over and tell me he had just what I wanted and produce a bears ashtray, a woman would call out \"chicago for you?\" to try to get me into her store.  This went on for the rest of the walk and there were multiple times  when vendors called me a liar because I said no, no bears for me.

The\nBureau investigated this matter to assess Marriott\u2019s compliance with Section 333 of the Act and has entered\ninto the attached Consent Decree. To resolve the Bureau\u2019s investigation, Marriott is required, among other\nthings, (i) to pay a $600,000 civil penalty to the United States Treasury, (ii) to develop and implement a\ncompliance plan, and (iii) to submit periodic compliance and usage reports, including information\ndocumenting to the Bureau any use of containment functionalities of Wi-Fi monitoring systems, at any U.S.\n\nThe complainant called it that, and it was for WiFi only.  they were at no point \"jamming\" cell phone signals.  At least where we are, what they would have been doing was using deauth packets to keep devices from connecting to the \"rouge\" SSID, thus keeping the air clear.  This is literally just a checkbox to turn on in the controllers we use, and since the FCC busted Marriotts chops about it they freaked out and we cant even keep the monitoring side of it on, which means we cant detect if 20 SSID's are using channel 6 and change ours to something else not as crowded, which just makes the problem even worse.\n\n>You think that's okay?

When you first meet people try to notice their eye color while also smiling at them. It might be because you look for a second or two longer, but all I can tell you is that people really respond to it. \n> 2. Pay attention to people's feet. If you approach two people in the middle of a conversation, and they only turn their torsos and not their feet, they don't want you to join in the conversation. Similarly if you are in a conversation with a coworker who you think is paying attention to you and their torso is turned towards you but their feet are facing in another direction, they want the conversation to end. \n> 3. Foot-in-the-door phenomenon. People are more likely to agree to do a task for you if you ask them to do something simpler first. (Gradual Commitment... makes people them think you like them) \n> 4. Alternatively you ask them to do an unreasonable task, and they'll say no, so then you ask for what you wanted, a much more reasonable task, and they're more likely to agree that way. \n> 5. If you ask someone to do you a small favor, cognitive dissonance will make them believe that because they did that favor, they therefore must like you. {yes you all know that -- Ben Franklin} \n> 6. If you ask someone a question and they only partially answer just wait. If you stay silent and keep eye contact they will usually continue talking. \n> 7. Chew gum when you're approaching a situation that would make you nervous like public speaking or bungee jumping. I can't remember where I heard it but apparently if we are 'eating' something in our brains trip and it reasons 'I would not be eating if I were danger. So I'm not in danger. Has helped calm me a few times. \n> 8. Avoid the sidewalk shuffle by looking intently over the person's shoulder, or between people's heads in a group. Your gaze shows them where you're going. They'll drift toward the opposing side / create a gap to avoid you. \n> 9. When you're studying/learning something new, teach a friend how/about it. Let them ask questions. If you're able to teach something well, you understand it. \n> 10. People will remember not what you said but how you made them feel. \n> 11. For interviews I recommend altering your psychological state beforehand. Tell yourself \"I've known these people all my life. We're old friends catching up. I can't wait to see them\". Visualize the experience, shaking hands, making eye contact, having conversation. What things can you not to wait to tell them? Hold an open pose...stand with your legs apart, hands on your hips, and shoulders back while doing this and SMILE. This may sound cliche but you are in charge of your own psychological state and the power of suggestion is strong. \n> 12. If you get yourself to be really happy and excited to see other people, they will react the same to you. It doesn't always happen the first time, but it will definitely happen next time.\n> 13. My personal favorite is when people are angry at me; if I stay calm it'll get them even angrier, and be ashamed about it after. \n> 14. If you have a warm hand when you shake somebody's hand, you immediately become a more desirable person to get along with. \n> 15. People have a certain image of themselves and will fight tooth and nail to cling to it. Use this information wisely. You can make people dislike you by attacking their self-image. \n> 16. False attribution of arousal. When you take somebody out on a first date, take them somewhere exciting that will get their heart beating. e.g. roller coaster or horror film. This gets their adrenaline up. It makes them think they enjoy spending time with you rather than the activity. \n> 17. The key to confidence is walking into a room, and assuming everyone already likes you. \n> 18. The physical effects of stress (increased breathing rate, heart rate ect.) mirror identically the physical effects of courage. So when you're feeling stress from any situation immediately reframe it: your body is getting ready to do courage, it's Not feeling stress.. \n> 19. Refer to people you've just met by their name. People loving being referred to by their name, and it will establish a sense of trust and friendship right away...\n> 20. If you make the biggest smile you can, you will automatically feel happier\n> 21. The moment your alarm wakes you up, immediately react by sitting up, pump your fists and shout \"YEAH!\" {wut?} \n> 22. Always give your kid a choice that makes them think they are in control. For instance when I want him to put his shoes on I will say ,\"do you want to put your star wars shoes on or your shark shoes on?\" \n> 23. People are extraordinarily aware of their sense of touch. If someone (a member of the opposite sex?) 'accidentally' rests their knee on yours, let's say, they know it's there.

When you first meet people try to notice their eye color while also smiling at them. It might be because you look for a second or two longer, but all I can tell you is that people really respond to it. \n> 2. Pay attention to people's feet. If you approach two people in the middle of a conversation, and they only turn their torsos and not their feet, they don't want you to join in the conversation. Similarly if you are in a conversation with a coworker who you think is paying attention to you and their torso is turned towards you but their feet are facing in another direction, they want the conversation to end. \n> 3. Foot-in-the-door phenomenon. People are more likely to agree to do a task for you if you ask them to do something simpler first. (Gradual Commitment... makes people them think you like them) \n> 4. Alternatively you ask them to do an unreasonable task, and they'll say no, so then you ask for what you wanted, a much more reasonable task, and they're more likely to agree that way. \n> 5. If you ask someone to do you a small favor, cognitive dissonance will make them believe that because they did that favor, they therefore must like you. {yes you all know that -- Ben Franklin} \n> 6. If you ask someone a question and they only partially answer just wait. If you stay silent and keep eye contact they will usually continue talking. \n> 7. Chew gum when you're approaching a situation that would make you nervous like public speaking or bungee jumping. I can't remember where I heard it but apparently if we are 'eating' something in our brains trip and it reasons 'I would not be eating if I were danger. So I'm not in danger. Has helped calm me a few times. \n> 8. Avoid the sidewalk shuffle by looking intently over the person's shoulder, or between people's heads in a group. Your gaze shows them where you're going. They'll drift toward the opposing side / create a gap to avoid you. \n> 9. When you're studying/learning something new, teach a friend how/about it. Let them ask questions. If you're able to teach something well, you understand it. \n> 10. People will remember not what you said but how you made them feel. \n> 11. For interviews I recommend altering your psychological state beforehand. Tell yourself \"I've known these people all my life. We're old friends catching up. I can't wait to see them\". Visualize the experience, shaking hands, making eye contact, having conversation. What things can you not to wait to tell them? Hold an open pose...stand with your legs apart, hands on your hips, and shoulders back while doing this and SMILE. This may sound cliche but you are in charge of your own psychological state and the power of suggestion is strong. \n> 12. If you get yourself to be really happy and excited to see other people, they will react the same to you. It doesn't always happen the first time, but it will definitely happen next time.\n> 13. My personal favorite is when people are angry at me; if I stay calm it'll get them even angrier, and be ashamed about it after. \n> 14. If you have a warm hand when you shake somebody's hand, you immediately become a more desirable person to get along with. \n> 15. People have a certain image of themselves and will fight tooth and nail to cling to it. Use this information wisely. You can make people dislike you by attacking their self-image. \n> 16. False attribution of arousal. When you take somebody out on a first date, take them somewhere exciting that will get their heart beating. e.g. roller coaster or horror film. This gets their adrenaline up. It makes them think they enjoy spending time with you rather than the activity. \n> 17. The key to confidence is walking into a room, and assuming everyone already likes you. \n> 18. The physical effects of stress (increased breathing rate, heart rate ect.) mirror identically the physical effects of courage. So when you're feeling stress from any situation immediately reframe it: your body is getting ready to do courage, it's Not feeling stress.. \n> 19. Refer to people you've just met by their name. People loving being referred to by their name, and it will establish a sense of trust and friendship right away...\n> 20. If you make the biggest smile you can, you will automatically feel happier\n> 21. The moment your alarm wakes you up, immediately react by sitting up, pump your fists and shout \"YEAH!\" {wut?} \n> 22. Always give your kid a choice that makes them think they are in control. For instance when I want him to put his shoes on I will say ,\"do you want to put your star wars shoes on or your shark shoes on?\" \n> 23. People are extraordinarily aware of their sense of touch. If someone (a member of the opposite sex?) 'accidentally' rests their knee on yours, let's say, they know it's there.

Then tuck the loose triangles under the bag exposing the soil. \n\nThen I'd then open another couple of bags of top soil and pour it over the top, making an effort to obscure the sides of the bottom bag. \n\nThe bag underneath as well as the weight of the soil on top kills the sod underneath and you have a quick, ready to use raised bed with no digging. If you're there for a year, you can pull the bag out and let the roots get down into that organic, nitrogen-rich goodness of rotted grass. \n\nI wouldn't recommend doing this for veggies or flowers unless you amend the topsoil with...mmm maybe 1/4 as much aged manure or compost because flowers generally need a lot more nutrition than you can get in run-of-the-mill topsoil.

Because it's easy and SO DAMNED DELICIOUS.\n\nEvery fall before the temperature fell below 40 degrees (at which point outside-planted basil turns black and wilts), I gather up an armful, bring it in, take off the bottom 6 inches of leaves, re-cut the stems so a freshly cut end hits the water soon after it's cut (plant goo clogs the water channels between the cutting of it outside and the bringing it in), and place it in big pickle jars in fresh, cold water. I changed the water every few days. I often had fresh basil through to the beginning of December, with plants well-rooted in water. \n\nBasil is a perennial in warmer climates, like our spearmint is. As others have said, plants need NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) so if you put the right amount of plant food in the water, you might be able to keep basil and other mints even longer and replant it in the spring, but I don't bother with the extra process. All mint-related herbs can root inside in water rather well including peppermint, spearmint, basil, oregano, marjoram, sage (if you can get a long enough stem), lemon balm, and bee balm (bergamot)...off the top of my head. You can tell a mint-related herb because the leaf pairs grow 180 to the last pair before it on the stem, and the stems feel square because of the four tiny ribs that grow along the outside. \n\nMake sure no leaves are in the water, they will rot quickly and stink up the house.\n\nParsley grows on a long taproot like a dandelion or carrot (to which they are closely related), so it won't root or last nearly as long, but you will get another week or more out of it by putting it in water right after it's cut.

If I ate like crap all day then have 6 beers I'll have a slight hangover the next day.\n\nThe problem with that list is sugar, pear juice (concentrated natural sugar) and carbs are all the same macro... they are just carbs in the end.\n\nThe reason your body craves carbs is because your electrolytes are low. You need lots of sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Most of us get those minerals from carb rich foods so your body is telling you to eat those foods. You can get sodium from soups, or just salting your food, magnesium from nuts and red meats, and potassium is hard to get without eating something high in carbs like potatoes or bananas (these foods are beneficial to eat even though they will elevate your blood sugar).\n\nGreat breakfast to have for a hangover. Steak eggs and spinach, with hash browns or a banana. Top that off with a large glass of water. That will get your electrolytes in you.\n\nAlso when you have had enough drinking, switch over to water, try and get a few glasses down before bed.\n\nAs far as pain medication goes, DON'T TAKE ASPIRIN OR TYLENOL!!! Your liver has already had a rough night, those drugs are hard on your liver as it is. Take ibuprofen, 200-800mgs depending on your headache. If you have a sour stomach then try some sprite (preferably sugar free) or ginger ale with real ginger.

The price increase that you see is true but it's not because the software is tracking your moves and try to score a higher price but mainly because when you search for a flight and continue for at least one more move it creates the PNR for you in order to save your seat from the inventory. And of course with each seat saved, the prices may or may not increase depending on your booking class (Not just economy, business but the actual class created for each price range).\n\nThese PNRs get destroyed when you don't complete the booking but of course after a certain time which depends on the software and the choice of the airline. And when these PNRs get destroyed the prices go down as well.\n\nAnother price difference that you might notice is caused by promotions to certain customer groups. It's not that they're trying to sell at a higher price; it's the opposite. For certain customer groups the seat might be cheaper. This might depend on several different parameters like where you're searching from, what actions you take before you search (depending on your behavior you might just fit to a certain pattern and get a promotion)\n\nThere are also other factors in play as well. The sales channels of the airline are not strictly online, there are tour operators, global sales agencies and such which might have a better offer because of their agreement with the airline.\n\nThis can get really really complex at times which I'm not going to be able to explain here.

The price increase that you see is true but it's not because the software is tracking your moves and try to score a higher price but mainly because when you search for a flight and continue for at least one more move it creates the PNR for you in order to save your seat from the inventory. And of course with each seat saved, the prices may or may not increase depending on your booking class (Not just economy, business but the actual class created for each price range).\n\nThese PNRs get destroyed when you don't complete the booking but of course after a certain time which depends on the software and the choice of the airline. And when these PNRs get destroyed the prices go down as well.\n\nAnother price difference that you might notice is caused by promotions to certain customer groups. It's not that they're trying to sell at a higher price; it's the opposite. For certain customer groups the seat might be cheaper. This might depend on several different parameters like where you're searching from, what actions you take before you search (depending on your behavior you might just fit to a certain pattern and get a promotion)\n\nThere are also other factors in play as well. The sales channels of the airline are not strictly online, there are tour operators, global sales agencies and such which might have a better offer because of their agreement with the airline.\n\nThis can get really really complex at times which I'm not going to be able to explain here.

Their tests also showed less liquid loss than the traditional thawing methods, above.

A USDA sponsored research project published in mid 2011 showed that you can thaw a 1\" thick steak in a 102\u00b0F water in 11 minutes and the meat moves rapidly through the \"danger zone\" within which microbes like to grow if you remove it promptly after it has thawed. Their tests also showed less liquid loss than the traditional thawing methods, above. If you want to try this at home, use hot water, lots of it to absorb the cold, weight it under with a plate, stir it occasionally because the meat will create an envelope of cold water around itself, and set a timer so you don't leave it in hot water too long. Thawing times will vary depending on the thickness of the meat and the actual heat of the water. This technique is best for steaks, chops, and chicken parts, but it will not work on thick cuts like roasts, pork butt, brisket, or turkey because the exterior will stay in the danger zone too long.\"\n\nSource: http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/thawing_meat.html , http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/dining/a-hot-water-bath-for-thawing-meats-the-curious-cook.html?_r=0", "id": "d0slyll"}, {"comment": "I don't think thawing ground beef this way is particularly dangerous, but there's a huge difference between a 1\" thick steak and a 1\" think hunk of ground beef in a Ziploc bag.

Trying to ELI5 here, so not entirely accurate:\n\n> A dynamic compressor works by bringing down the volume of the source audio when it gets higher than a certain threshold. It doesn't do anything until the volume hits said threshold, where it gets bring down with certain parameters. You can see some of those here.\n\n> * **RMS/Peak** : Those a pretty much methods for calculating the volume. Peak is \"real\" volume. It's what you see on those kind of meters on various audio equipment around you, or in your favorite media player. RMS is a mathematical scale that's closer to how our ear perceives volume changes. Our ears are not accurate, so real volume is different than perceived volume. It's closer to an average, and doesn't represent the volume at every moment. Those VU meters you've maybe seen on older consumer audio equipment are based on that scale. Here, being it at 0.0 means it's 100% RMS-based, so it will compress basically much more on loud parts, and less on quieter parts, instead of applying every time the volume jumps over the threshold for a second.\n> * **Attack** : The time the compressor takes to entirely kick in. Here it's at 1,4ms, so it kicks in almost instantly.\n> * **Release** : The time the compressor takes to completely remove it's effect after the audio goes under the threshold. 1.9ms is really fast, so it will release almost instantly when volume goes back under the threshold.\n> * **Threshold** : The volume where the effect kicks in. Below, does nothing. Over, boom. -20dB usually means it will kick in all over the place, but that depends on the source material's volume. The \"Attack/Threshold/Release\" combination is pretty well explained by this graphic. The blue line represents the volume of the original signal, the red dotted line is the audio after compression.\n> * **Ratio** : How much the volume is brought down when it is higher than this level. Here, 20:1 means it takes 20dB at the input to output a 1dB volume increase. To give you an idea, 3dB is technically twice the power (4dB is 4x, etc... getting exponentially bigger) and 10dB is perceived as twice louder by human ear, so it's a pretty drastic effect.\n> * **Knee radius** : This setting is a bit weird. A 0dB knee means the compression hits exactly at the threshold, while a softer knee means the compression will progressively come into play a little bit before the threshold and build up to full ratio after it. Here is a simple image that puts it simply enough. The knee being at 1dB means that this is almost not used at all here, so 20:1 compression is close to instantly in effect when of threshold.\n> * **Makeup gain** : This is basically a volume knob for the output of the processor. Here, independently of everything else, it will permanently push the volume up of 12dB.\n\n> Those settings basically sets the VLC compressor to act as a brickwall limiter. Does what its name says. It's pretty extreme and will squish everything, leaving basically no dynamics. Yeah, spoken volume will be a lot louder, but music and everything else will be compressed to hell and will lose impact.\n\n> I think you can push this to 4:1, 8:1 for crappy laptop speakers, maybe, but those settings basically are garbage if you care about audio quality. Don't use them if you are listening on a good audio system - turn up the volume.\n\n> tl;dr - read this shit, it's interesting. you lazy ass."], [1, "aanndd suddenly every horror movie of the last ten years loses the element of horror."], [1, "Just remap everything to the left channel and crank it up until your balls hurt."], [0, "Any sufficiently non shit (read as: not built in to motherboard) sound card will be able to do this with the manufacturer's drivers.

It's standard practice, you can't show the same exact thing that you do in the cinema, it's a different environment/sound system/screen. And even that's not enough, think about it, some people have expensive audiophile quality 7.1 systems at home, some people have laptop speakers/headphones.\n\nThey were probably aiming for people with good sound systems when they did the new mix for Interstellar. They probably didn't want to compromise and give up the dynamics of the movie just to satisfy people with shitty sound systems.\n\n  I know it sounds snobby but imo this movie is intended to be experienced on the best - powerful, dynamic, high quality - systems; it was made in a way that utilizes the best available systems to the fullest possible extent. It's pushing boundaries. When I watched it in the movies even their best theater wasn't quite good enough not to distort the subs. But I live in a relatively poor country. Probably a lot of cinemas fuck their sound systems up and don't pay for new subs/better systems. Filmmakers also give specific instructions for the cinemas on how to show their movies (A/V settings) and a lot of times they can't comply or don't care. \n\nI think it's kinda something you have to go out of your way to enjoy but that probably wasn't the intention of the filmmaker, it's more like a compromise imo. They did some bold shit with the technicalities of this movie and they went out on a limb that people will get it and adapt the settings in the cinemas/at home. Personally I think they were right, there's more people admiring the experience than complaining. \n\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the movie is sort of an experiment in filmmaking. I think it worked, but naturally the films following this trend (meaning the quality ones inspired by it, not the copycats) will more likely do it better.

Trying to ELI5 here, so not entirely accurate:\n\n> A dynamic compressor works by bringing down the volume of the source audio when it gets higher than a certain threshold. It doesn't do anything until the volume hits said threshold, where it gets bring down with certain parameters. You can see some of those here.\n\n> * **RMS/Peak** : Those a pretty much methods for calculating the volume. Peak is \"real\" volume. It's what you see on those kind of meters on various audio equipment around you, or in your favorite media player. RMS is a mathematical scale that's closer to how our ear perceives volume changes. Our ears are not accurate, so real volume is different than perceived volume. It's closer to an average, and doesn't represent the volume at every moment. Those VU meters you've maybe seen on older consumer audio equipment are based on that scale. Here, being it at 0.0 means it's 100% RMS-based, so it will compress basically much more on loud parts, and less on quieter parts, instead of applying every time the volume jumps over the threshold for a second.\n> * **Attack** : The time the compressor takes to entirely kick in. Here it's at 1,4ms, so it kicks in almost instantly.\n> * **Release** : The time the compressor takes to completely remove it's effect after the audio goes under the threshold. 1.9ms is really fast, so it will release almost instantly when volume goes back under the threshold.\n> * **Threshold** : The volume where the effect kicks in. Below, does nothing. Over, boom. -20dB usually means it will kick in all over the place, but that depends on the source material's volume. The \"Attack/Threshold/Release\" combination is pretty well explained by this graphic. The blue line represents the volume of the original signal, the red dotted line is the audio after compression.\n> * **Ratio** : How much the volume is brought down when it is higher than this level. Here, 20:1 means it takes 20dB at the input to output a 1dB volume increase. To give you an idea, 3dB is technically twice the power (4dB is 4x, etc... getting exponentially bigger) and 10dB is perceived as twice louder by human ear, so it's a pretty drastic effect.\n> * **Knee radius** : This setting is a bit weird. A 0dB knee means the compression hits exactly at the threshold, while a softer knee means the compression will progressively come into play a little bit before the threshold and build up to full ratio after it. Here is a simple image that puts it simply enough. The knee being at 1dB means that this is almost not used at all here, so 20:1 compression is close to instantly in effect when of threshold.\n> * **Makeup gain** : This is basically a volume knob for the output of the processor. Here, independently of everything else, it will permanently push the volume up of 12dB.\n\n> Those settings basically sets the VLC compressor to act as a brickwall limiter. Does what its name says. It's pretty extreme and will squish everything, leaving basically no dynamics. Yeah, spoken volume will be a lot louder, but music and everything else will be compressed to hell and will lose impact.\n\n> I think you can push this to 4:1, 8:1 for crappy laptop speakers, maybe, but those settings basically are garbage if you care about audio quality. Don't use them if you are listening on a good audio system - turn up the volume.\n\n> tl;dr - read this shit, it's interesting. you lazy ass.", "id": "d0q7s13"}, {"comment": "Tell this to EDM producers ", "id": "d0q9uni"}, {"comment": "Or pretty much every goddamn music subgenre these days.", "id": "d0qafq0"}], [{"comment": "aanndd suddenly every horror movie of the last ten years loses the element of horror.", "id": "d0qaawn"}, {"comment": "It's been so long since I've seen a horror movie that hasn't relied on just loud jump scares.

At the first sign of a runny nose, take cetirizine (brand name Zyrtec) or some antihistamine. That stops the runny nose. \n2. However, if you don't, our badly designed sinuses fill up and that causes swelling. Now your nose is blocked. Double attack with ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine (brand name Advil cold and sinus). Get the real meth lab stuff, not the \"safe\" solution.  I buy both separately and combine when necessary. \n3. So now we've provided relief, but what about if it goes lower?  For coughing, use dexteomethorphan (brand name Delsym). Coughing is caused by your sinuses and nose draining down your throat (see #1 to stop that). \n4. If it goes even lower into your chest, use guaifenesin (brand name mucinex). Remember that an occasional cough is good when using a chest expectorant since you have to cough up the yuck to get rid of it. \n\n\nAlways buy generics.

Been using this method for 15 years on the advice of a pharmacist (not a doctor, because a doctor is like an IT guy and a pharmacist is like a Cisco specialist). \n\n\n1. At the first sign of a runny nose, take cetirizine (brand name Zyrtec) or some antihistamine. That stops the runny nose. \n2. However, if you don't, our badly designed sinuses fill up and that causes swelling. Now your nose is blocked. Double attack with ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine (brand name Advil cold and sinus). Get the real meth lab stuff, not the \"safe\" solution.  I buy both separately and combine when necessary. \n3. So now we've provided relief, but what about if it goes lower?  For coughing, use dexteomethorphan (brand name Delsym). Coughing is caused by your sinuses and nose draining down your throat (see #1 to stop that). \n4. If it goes even lower into your chest, use guaifenesin (brand name mucinex). Remember that an occasional cough is good when using a chest expectorant since you have to cough up the yuck to get rid of it. \n\n\nAlways buy generics. Brand names are a waste of money and are chemically equivalent to generics. \n\n\nGo to CVS, Walgreens, Duane reade, etc and talk to the pharmacist.", "id": "d7b5qzj"}, {"comment": "A pharmacy student shared this on Reddit a while back - \n\n\n\n>pharmacy student here. all these recommendations are for your average, healthy (no other medical conditions) adults.\n\n>**cough:** if it's dry, look for dextromethorphan (delsym). if it's a productive cough (mucus-y), then guafenisin (in robutussin and mucinex) is a good option. just make sure to drink A LOT of water as that can help thin the mucus in your chest as well. if the cough doesn't go away in 7 days or you're running a fever as well, go see your doctor. \n\n>**cold:** pseudoephedrine (sudafed) sold behind the pharmacy counter. it's a decongestant. might make you feel little jittery though, so i don't recommend taking this before bed. also, don't take this if you have any heart problems or blood pressure issues. afrin is also a great choice, but DO NOT take more than recommended. you'll get rebound congestion and get addicted to it (i'm serious...my dad's been addicted for YEARS). also saline sprays and neti pots work well, but make sure to use filtered water in the neti pot. \n\n>**allergies:** i always tell people to start with claritin (loratadine), then if that doesn't work move to zyrtec (cetirizine), then if that doesn't work move to allegra (fexofenadine). mainly just because of the cost. different allergy meds work for different people. if your eyes are a huge problem, look for eye drops that have ketotifen as their main ingredient (like zaditor). flonase and nasacort are awesome, too.\n\n>**headache/pain:** tylenol or any OTC NSAID (ibuprofen-advil, naproxen-aleve) works well. make sure not to take more than 3 grams of tylenol in a day. ibuprofen max is 1200 mg/day and naproxen max is 660 mg/day. if the pain is more inflammatory in nature, then pick the NSAID over tylenol. beware NSAIDs if you have stomach issues like ulcers or GERD and also if you have kidney problems or if you're on a blood pressure med. avoid tylenol if you're a heavy drinker or have liver problems. \n\n>**nausea:** to prevent motion sickness, meclizine or diphenhydramine (benadryl) are great choices. pepto bismol is good for nausea associated with food or beverages.\n\n>**diarrhea:** ORAL REHYDRATION THERAPY! go pick up that salty nastiness that is pedialyte and drink it! also water. drink anywhere between 2-4 L over 3-4 hours and try to resume a normal diet as soon as possible. imodium (loperamide) and pepto bismol are also options, but go to your doctor if diarrhea happens for more than 48 hours. \n\n>**constipation:** if it's been less than 7 days and you're not on an opioid pain med, try lifestyle changes. aerobic exercise, increasing fiber intake to between 20-35 grams, and drinking 1-4 L of water/day. then try bulk-forming laxatives (metamucil, citrucel). those should work in 1-3 days. if that doesn't work, move to miralax (takes about a day to work). if that doesn't work, try senna or bisacodyl (takes 6-12 hours to work). but if it's been a week, go see your doctor. \n\n>**heartburn:** first line, try tums. take these with your meal as they last longer if ingested with food. if you're using these more than two times a week for two weeks, move up to H2 antagonist (ranitidine-zantac). take this 30 minutes before meals (only twice daily max). and if that doesn't work, you can try a 14 day trial of a PPI (omeprazole-prilosec, lansoprazole-prevacid, esomeprazole-nexium). take these once a day 30 minutes before the biggest meal, and they may take 1-3 days to work. still have symptoms? time to see a doctor. and these recommendations are ONLY for people that have typical symptoms of heartburn (exclusions for people that have trouble swallowing or pain when swallowing).", "id": "d7b8399"}, {"comment": "Fuck, I had diarrhea for 2 weeks not too long ago and didn't do any of that.
