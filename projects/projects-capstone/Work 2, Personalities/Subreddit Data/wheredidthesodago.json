We were scouring the alleys in Vieille Ville looking for the perfect restaurant to enjoy our last meal in the South of France. It had been a long day of sightseeing in the sun and we were famished. This meal was to be a memorable one, turns out for all the wrong reasons.\n\n\nAfter finally finding the restaurant recommended to us we sat down \u2013 and like a typical tourist we opened our phones to the crowd-source review websites to determine what to eat. The images of the lamb shank stood out, and the reviews had nothing but good things to say. So we ate. The reviews were right, it was delicous. Paired with a delightful local ros\u00e9 wine we earned a bloated physique.\n\n\nNow that the meal was done we wandered back through the alleys of Vieille Ville toward our room overlooking Place Mass\u00e9na. While walking I felt the need to swallow deep, something wasn't sitting right\u2026 but it was probably just indigestion from the acidity of the wine. It's a lovely walk, but that is easily trumped by a bloated drunk stumble accented with the constant need to burp noxious fumes.\n\n\nBack at our room we got ready for bed, in a typical fashion where my girlfriend takes a lot longer than I \u2013 so I lay on the bed staring at the ceiling. \"This indigestion will go away soon\" I kept telling myself. That's when I felt a thump in my lower abdomen. It's time to for the lamb shank to meet the bowl, but my girlfriend is still getting ready for bed. \n\n\nI wait. And I wait. And I wait. \n\n\nAt last, it's time. I head in to the bathroom, turn on the fan, and try to release the pressure as quietly as possible. Anyone in this situation knows, when your lower abdomen feels like it's about to drop out there's no quiet way to go about it. \n\n\nAs I sat there I feel the lump in my throat still. The burps. But nothing is coming. I want it to come. But nothing is there, just acid reflux. I try and force the purge but it's only met with failure. I head back to bed and repeat for a few hours until it's time to head to the airport. A night without sleep.\n\n\nIn the morning I felt like nothing had digested, and I hadn't slept a wink. We drove  along Prom des Anglais towards A\u00e9roport Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur as the sun was rising. It was a beautiful morning, but all I could think of was how awful my stomach felt. There's still a good chance this will past.\n\n\nWhen getting to the airport we drop off the car at the rental booth. As one always does, I fear there is damage that I didn't know existed. But we past the test. We are in the clear to get our damage deposit back.\n\n\nWith an hour until our flight my girlfriend stops for a caf\u00e9 au lait and a croissant at the Paul before check-in. The thought of eating a croissant and having any milk product makes me feel nauseous \u2013 if I have anything other than water I'll hurl. Water it is. I'm in pain. But maybe the water will help?\n\n\nWe go through security without a hitch and board the plane.\n\n\nFairly close to the front I sit at the window in seat F, my girlfriend in the middle seat (she's small so it's only fair), and a Parisian lady in the aisle seat. The Parisian lady was posh, the type who dresses up for a flight and regrets sitting with the regular people. A regret that's about to be justified. \n\n\n10 minutes in to the flight I'm swallowing deeper and deeper. My stomach more and more bloated and agonizing. \"I can hold it together\", I keep telling myself. I look out the window as my girlfriend reads the latest gossip magazines on her iPad. Not a cloud in the sky, I watch as we fly by Parc national de la Vanoise as we come up West of Geneva. Then it hits.\n\n\nI get cold \u2014 \"Fuck.\" \n\nI start sweating \u2014 \"Fuck.\" \n\nMy mouth starts salivating \u2014 \"oh\u2026 FUCK!\"\n\n\nI look at my girlfriend. \"Jesus!\", she says. \"You're pale!\"\n\n\nI panic. I need to run to the bathroom, but that involves getting through two people and then scrambling to the facilities. \"Do I run to the back?\"\u2026 \"Is there a bathroom at the front?\"\u2026 \"Fuck it\u2026 there's not enough time!\"\n\n\nIn front of me there's the answer. The infamous barf bag. That thing you always see on the flight and think \"what pussy needs a barf bag?\". That pussy is me. I grab the bag in a panic and unload all the contents of my stomach (lamb, wine, and all) with a violent groan. The sound of the liquidated meat, wine, and bile hitting the bottom of the bag could probably be heard from the back of the plane. The smell rushes out and envelopes, what has to be, 5 rows in front of us and 10 rows behind.\n\n\nLooking over I see the Parisian lady high tail it out of there with her hand held to her mouth, never to return. Instant upgrade. My girlfriend can barely keep it together. To this day she says it's one of the worst smells she's had to endure. The flight attendant comes over with napkins and ginger-ale, she looks at me like she's looking death in the face. \"If there's anything you need, let me know\", she says with her words, meanwhile her face says \"why do I get the barfer on my shift? in my section?\"\n\n\nI sit there. For the rest of the flight. Pale. Sweaty. Cold. And holding a bag that contains all the contents of my stomach like it's my bagged lunch. The plane is quiet. Not a word. I'm curled in a ball looking outside, ashamed and embarrassed. \"I'm THAT guy\", I say to myself. \"Who the fuck uses these barf bags? Me, I'm that guy\". I feel the eyes piercing the back of my head, I just made this flight a story the other passengers tell their friends for years. I'm their worst flight story. When someone talks to them about having a crying baby on their flight, they can respond \"At least you didn't have a violently ill adult male puking in to a bag, enveloping the plane with the smell of fermented meat and wine\". \n\n\nWhen we land and come to a complete stop I look at my feet. I attempt to ignore that people want to see the face of the man who made flying go from bad to worse. My face will be a part of their \"worst flight\" story. They will forever remember me.\n\n\nAfter landing we catch the train to our room next to Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Where I recover from the sickness but never the story.\n\nTo this day my girlfriend calls me \"Barfy\".", "id": "d23q9df"}, {"comment": "Ugh you poor man!

If you fail to shape it, it's just a big lump that isn't going to mash down when you lay on it.\n\nThey also tend to come a little overfilled so you need to take some of the filling out and adjust it to your level.\n\nI also got a \"Queen\" sized one, which you may not want, the thing weighs like 10 pounds.   \n\nSo I'd say downsides: Heavy, requires fiddling to tweak filling level and needs to be shaped every time you lay on it.

Good to use if you want to sit up in bed because you can reshape it in a way that fills the gap between you and the wall/headboard better than a regular pillow.\n\nIt's just a very different experience.

It was rather dull in fact. It was smaller and a little thicker than a credit card and semi-transparent. If you held it up to the light you could see a lot of holographically encoded information and images buried pseudo-inches deep beneath its surface.\n\nIt was an Ident-i-Eeze, and was a very naughty and silly thing for Harl to have lying around in his wallet, though it was perfectly understandable. There were so many different ways in which you were required to provide absolute proof of your identity these days that life could easily become extremely tiresome just from that factor alone, never mind the deeper existential problems of trying to function as a coherent consciousness in an epistemologically ambiguous physical universe. Just look at cash point machines, for instance. Queues of people standing around waiting to have their fingerprints read, their retinas scanned, bits of skin scraped from the nape of the neck and undergoing instant (or nearly instant - a good six or seven seconds in tedious reality) genetic analysis, then having to answer trick questions about members of their family they didn\u2019t even remember they had, and about their recorded preferences for tablecloth colours. And that was just to get a bit of spare cash for the weekend. If you were trying to raise a loan for a jetcar, sign a missile treaty or pay an entire restaurant bill things could get really trying.\n\nHence the Ident-i-Eeze. This encoded every single piece of information about you, your body and your life into one all-purpose machine-readable card that you could then carry around in your wallet, and therefore represented technology\u2019s greatest triumph to date over both itself and plain common sense.\n\n-Douglas Adams, Mostly Harmless", "id": "d8l5jzd"}, {"comment": "Incredibly prescient.", "id": "d8l5o56"}, {"comment": "This seems like a huge security risk tbh.", "id": "d8kz6n8"}, {"comment": "Not a security risk if it's properly encrypted.\n\nHowever, I seriously doubt the thing is thoroughly encrypted and I would guess if you gained access to the thing you could grab the details off of it.\n\nThere also the added fun side effect of losing it and losing all of your passwords forever!

The only one that even seems to work is the home electrolysis stuff, but you have to go follicle by follicle for that.", "id": "d8oz7lz"}, {"comment": "I *have* looked at the reviews, and that's where my viewpoint comes from. Mind you, expense and  \"short\"/\"long\" term are entirely relative. If one home IPL treatment a month is enough to appear hairless vs 15 shave sessions, I'd say that could easily be worth $500 for a machine when full laser/electro treatment is thousands. That time spent shaving adds up, and it's not like the act is fun, just the results.\n\nHair is going to be hair, and if you don't destroy it, it will come back. That can't be changed. But home treatments that are convenient and effective **compared to shaving** can still be worthwhile. You just have to be realistic and compare it to shaving, not professional electro.\n\nKeep in mind I'm also talking about women that shave nearly daily. That time adds up to more over a year (or a life) than prepping for one night of crossdressing does.", "id": "d8pigch"}, {"comment": "> The thing is if you look up reviews on all these \"longer term solutions\" they all look like total junk.

But even that takes 3-4 sessions and isn't really cheap. \n\nPersonally I manage fine with razors, cause after you get it all off it only takes a maintenance shave every other day, at least for legs (and maybe spot checks when you notice things). I think the only good method that works from like, starting with full body hair is waxing or sugaring?

NATO will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it; then NATO will nuke Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia; but will not get past Ural Mountains; bio-genetic weapon will be used against Chinese soldiers (they will run back to China and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze Siberia to - 200 Celcius; stadium-size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop Chinese aggression); radiation from this hole will be massive; Chinese will try to keep quiet about it; a lot of people will fall into this hole.\n\n\nScientists don't see dinosaurs because of radiation. Only Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists want war between Russia and Germany over Serbia from June to October on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their twisted logic). Tube people = demons. Clones = demons. Human costumes that demons wear = demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA; normal person can't swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin. There is another shroud on which blasphemer Yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Lenin (el=deity in Hebrew, nine = no in German; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator), and Yosef were possessed by Azazel; now, Rico Cortes is possessed by Azazel. WW3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; don't vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next false flag: Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran; one big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. Move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high). Wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it won't stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. Also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. Eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug DNA, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold; reject vaccines, medical care, medicine, etc. because nanochips are administered thru IVs, implants, fillings, etc. If 1000-1500 nanochips are in your right hand, then you can't make proper Orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand; last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. Seraphim of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrecred after WW3 for a short time; Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8 months. Those who go see Seraphim of Sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases; if you want to see him then, hurry because he won't stay longer than a few weeks.\n\n\nEarth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; don't believe in horoscopes or you'll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep.\n\n\nHumans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and Elijah return to preach against the antichrist.\nBirds participate in time creation. It's a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia.\n\n\nDemons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. Gov't provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If you're being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer.\n\n\nDon't panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. He's possessed by Satan since he's 12 years old. He flies. He wears gloves to hide long nails. He's surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light.\n\n\nDon't go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World Passport). Police will microchip and isotope ray people on the highways. Microchipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, 666 is given. Food stores will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell.\n\n\nIf you're about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichrist's minions can't track you. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell twice a year (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell.

Any female who breaks this rule should have a clitoridectomy. This should be a good enough deterrent for lesbian females to not participate in lesbian activity. I am a reasonable man and I know that lesbians are not attracted to men unless they are chad. Lesbians will live out their lesbian lifestyle with incels who volunteered to transition to female. Desperate incels will volunteer to transition to female and will be assigned a lesbian partner. This way lesbians, as well as incels, will be happy. Cute incels that transitioned to female can be assigned to another willing incel as well. The fact that females waste their precious resources on other females while men starve here is disgusting. If females want to be lesbian, then they should be lesbian with an incel. Lesbians are cucking all incels by sharing their female resources with each other, while we incels starve to death out of sexlessness. Females transitioning to men should be banned as well. This only reduces the number of females incels can get. Men that are gay should get extra government funding.

Just test it by putting in an rfid chip and see if it works?\n\nAssuming that's correct, NFC uses 13.56 MHz frq for transmission (as a standard for High Frequency Transmission). According to that website you only get 21 microns of skin depth for aluminum (citation needed), so you'd need [c/13.56 MHz = 22.1m](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/44037/why-is-near-field-communication-nfc-range-limited-to-about-20cm) of exposed aluminum.

For lower frequency longer range rfid, a different approach is probably needed.\n\nEdit: There are also other precautions to prevent skimming.

[Source](http://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/opponent-red-zone-scoring-pct)\n\nSeattle's tied for the 5th most sacks (31, should have had more on Sunday). [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/passing/sort/sacks/position/defense)\n\nThey've only allowed four rushing touchdowns, and the longest run they've given up is just 28 yards. [Source](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/rushing/sort/rushingTouchdowns/position/defense)\n\nFootball Outsiders ranks Seattle's pass rush as the 6th best in the NFL. [Source](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/dl)\n\nLast year, Bobby Wagner had the best run stop percentage ([Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/pff-signature-stats/#RunStopPercentage) ), KJ Wright had the 4th best tackling efficiency ([Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/pff-signature-stats/#TacklingEfficiency) ) and Bruce Irvin was the 6th most productive pass rusher ( [Source](https://www.profootballfocus.com/about/pff-signature-stats/#PassRushingProductivity) ). Those three have only gotten better this year.\n\nThere are eight players with multiple sacks. Chris Clemons has been this team's best pass rusher since 2010, but our two new additions (Michael Bennett with 6.5 and Cliff Avril with 5.5) have more sacks than him. Clinton McDonald has emerged as a quality pass rusher and has the same amount of sacks as Clemons (3.5). The team also has 26 tackles for a loss.

They're forced into them, and the hole begins to narrow, but the MC keeps sliding through the hole, his limbs stretching to fit the changing shape.\n\nMC wakes up and finds his girlfriend gone, the rocks from her hole removed.

What could possibly go wrong with cooking macaroni, you say, it's just adding water to it and boiling it. \n\nWell... he did succeed in making it edible, but he was really bad at estimating how much macaroni he should add since they grow in size. This guy pours a whole bag of macaroni (we're talking about **1,5KG!** of macaroni) in a cooking pot, and starts boiling it. \n\nWe can't help ourselves so we ask him what he's gonna do with 1500 grams of macaroni, that's enough to feed a small African family for a week. \n\nHe didn't understand the concept of macaroni getting bigger when they get cooked, so after 10 minutes when he saw that the pot couldn't contain all of the macaroni, he said:\"I'll have food for today, tomorrow and the day after that\" just as if he planned that all along.
