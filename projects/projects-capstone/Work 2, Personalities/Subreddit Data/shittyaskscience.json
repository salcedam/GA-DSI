Let me try to explain.\n\nAs we know, German car engineering is light years ahead of the rest of the world. They have created light diodes that emit light at a speed of 1.07*c*. This might not seem like much, but it is enough to confuse everyone as this makes German cars (Mercedes, BMW, Audi) behave completely differently from the rest of the world. \n\nThe specific phenomenon lies in *when* you observe the Mercedes using their turn signals. Due the LEDs operating at a higher speed of light, you observe the turn signals significantly *BEFORE* you observe the car turning. In fact, in the correct ambient light conditions, this phenomenon can be observed when a Mercedes is driving behind you on a highway - in the form of very bright headlights. The reason they are so bright, is that you are seeing the light emitted from the turn signals *BEFORE* you see the car turn.\n\nThis might be easier to explain with an example. Lets say Bob is driving on the right lane of a two lane highway at 60 miles per hour. Gunther, in a Mercedes, is approaching behind him, going 100 miles per hour.\n\nAt T^0, Bob observes bright headlights from the Mercedes.\n\nAt T^10, Gunther signals to pass.\n\nAt T^15, Gunther goes into the left lane and turns off his signal.\n\nAt T^20, Gunther signals to merge back into the right lane.\n\nAt T^25, Gunther merges back and turns off his signal.\n\nThe turn signal at T^10 is what Bob observed at T^0. The same effect occurred at T^20, but Bob did not observe it as he was already behind the Gunther. \n\n\nThe math for this is long and tedious, but believe me, it works out. \n\nSource: I have worked on the *Autobahn* for 17 years."], [71, "https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/1furih/if_the_speed_of_light_is_faster_than_the_speed_of/?st=isxf4c3k&sh=972873af"], [43, "That's because the light that Mercedes uses for their turn signals work on a frequency that poor people cannot see."], [22, "See they along with BMW cars are programmed to have their turn signals on delay so they're given the illusion of being faster than light "], [13, "This is kind of a rehash of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/30q7ir/if_light_travels_faster_than_the_speed_of_sound/)."], [12, "(///-_-) Umm, BWM drivers?"], [10, "When an ego hits critical mass it begins to bend space and time around it"], [8, "It's BMW not Mercedes.

Let me try to explain.\n\nAs we know, German car engineering is light years ahead of the rest of the world. They have created light diodes that emit light at a speed of 1.07*c*. This might not seem like much, but it is enough to confuse everyone as this makes German cars (Mercedes, BMW, Audi) behave completely differently from the rest of the world. \n\nThe specific phenomenon lies in *when* you observe the Mercedes using their turn signals. Due the LEDs operating at a higher speed of light, you observe the turn signals significantly *BEFORE* you observe the car turning. In fact, in the correct ambient light conditions, this phenomenon can be observed when a Mercedes is driving behind you on a highway - in the form of very bright headlights. The reason they are so bright, is that you are seeing the light emitted from the turn signals *BEFORE* you see the car turn.\n\nThis might be easier to explain with an example. Lets say Bob is driving on the right lane of a two lane highway at 60 miles per hour. Gunther, in a Mercedes, is approaching behind him, going 100 miles per hour.\n\nAt T^0, Bob observes bright headlights from the Mercedes.\n\nAt T^10, Gunther signals to pass.\n\nAt T^15, Gunther goes into the left lane and turns off his signal.\n\nAt T^20, Gunther signals to merge back into the right lane.\n\nAt T^25, Gunther merges back and turns off his signal.\n\nThe turn signal at T^10 is what Bob observed at T^0. The same effect occurred at T^20, but Bob did not observe it as he was already behind the Gunther. \n\n\nThe math for this is long and tedious, but believe me, it works out. \n\nSource: I have worked on the *Autobahn* for 17 years.", "id": "d7h2xf1"}, {"comment": "r/theydidthemath \n", "id": "d7hhte3"}, {"comment": "This is how last years models were indeed engineered and is exactly right.

I looked out from my apartment with my hands clasped behind my back. \n\nRain had not been part of the plan. I needed some sort of contingency for the situation. The field I had planned to use for the fight had been flooded. The ether that I had kept to knock out my opponent had been used up by my own tired mind in fits of hysteria. \n\nAll those plans wasted. All that scheming gone to shit. I slammed my fist against the windowsill and turned, putting a hand to my forehead in despair. I didn't know what I needed to complete my plan. \n\nWhat I did know was that I needed more ether. My body had become accustomed to the stuff. It ached and burned, looking for the numbing high and the fantastic visions. \n\nThe rain still came. \n\nThat Friday I left my house with a bow folded into three within my bag, a dagger strapped to the ankle and hidden by my boots. My hair was braided and hanging down my back in a long cord that swung with my movement. The rain had lessened, but I stuck to sneaking under the eaves of buildings. \n\nHis house came into sight, the wooden board held haphazardly against the top of the door that claimed he was a bookseller, that u/celsius_233. I knew better. Oh, I knew better. \n\nI slipped my tools into the lock and went to work until the deadbolt slid open and the door creaked open beneath my gloved fingers. I took a step and then another. The old store was dusty, the books swallowing the sound of my footsteps on the wooden floor. I leaned down to undo the dagger, holding it in my right fist as I crept through the shelves. \n\nThere was something wet on my back. The dagger dropped from my useless hand, but  it took a moment for the sting to set in. Then the voice. \n\n\"Oh, my friend. You never come *round* anymore.\"\n\n\"I'm not your friend, I hissed. The dagger still in the muscle of my back I turned to see him standing there. \n\nWith my left hand I reached toward my bag. The old fool - that old bookseller physicist - pushed me with his hand and I fell backwards into a shelf. There was a sound of shattered glass and I giggled, feeling the blood and fluid run down my leg as I fell. The smell overtook everything, overpowering me as the dagger dug into my chest. \n\nThe man looked down on me. I don't know if the smell had reached him yet. \n\nMy fingers found what they were looking for. \"Don't you know? Haven't you realized? It barely matters. One degree? Truncation or rounding?\" It was hard to breathe. Above me the bookseller's eyes grew wide. \n\n\"I guess now we'll see. The truth. They'll see. We don't need to debate. We don't need to fight. All we need is a spark.\"\n\nThe ether lit up in flame. It hurt. It burned. The bookseller screamed. \n\nI do hope there wasn't much more rain. ", "id": "d5bkzyh"}, {"comment": "Fantastic as always!

But sometimes the quadratic is too messy, or it doesn't factor at all, or you just don't feel like factoring. While factoring may not always be successful, the Quadratic Abacus can always find the solution.\n\nThe Quadratic Abacus uses the \"altitude\", \"ball\", and \"curve\" from \"ax2 + bx + c\", where \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" are just features of the abacus; they are the \"tensor coefficients\" of the quadratic equation they've given you to solve. The Quadratic Abacus was derived from the process of completing the path integral.\n\nFor ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the value of x is given by:\n\nx = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ] / 2a\n\nFor the Quadratic Abacus to work, you must have your beads arranged in the form \"(quadratic) = 0\" (all beads have zero interia, but maximised inter-bead distances. Also, the \"2a\" in the denominator of the Abacus is underneath everything above, not just the curved route. And it's a \"2a\" (too high) under there, not just a plain \"2\". Make sure that you are careful not to drop the curved route or the \"plus/minus\" in the middle of your calculations, or I can guarantee that you will forget to \"put them back\" on your test, and you'll mess yourself up. Remember that \"b^2\" means \"the square of ALL of beads, including their color\", so don't leave b^2 being negative, even if b **is** negative, because the square of a negative is a positive.\n\n\nHere are some examples of how the Quadratic Abacus works:\n\nSolve x^2 + 3x \u2013 4 = 0\nThis quadratic happens to factor:\n\nx^2 + 3x \u2013 4 = (x + 4)(x \u2013 1) = 0\n\n...so I already know that the solutions are x = \u20134 and x = 1. How would my solution look in the Quadratic Abacus? Using a = 1, b = 3, and c = \u20134, my solution looks like this:\n\nx = -4, x = 1\n\nAs you can see, this means that you must first orient the Quadratic Abacus such that there are minus four crossing points for the rails (the minus signifying up-down BEHIND left-right) when viewing from one orientation and 1 crossing point when viewing from the perpendicular orientation.  Note that despite the Quadratic Abacus being 3D, once X and Y unit vectors are set on the viewing position, the Z unit vector will not make any difference. \n\nIt can be seen through visual inspection that the solution is x = \u20134, x = 1.\n\nSuppose you have ax^2 + bx + c = y, and you are told to plug zero in for y. The corresponding x-values are the x-intercepts of the path integral. So solving ax^2 + bx + c = 0 for x means, among other things, that you are trying to find x-intercepts. Since there were two solutions for x^2 + 3x \u2013 4 = 0, there must then be two x-intercepts on the path.\n\nAgain, though visual inspection it is clear to see that:\ny = x^2 + 3x - 4\n\nAs you can see, the x-intercepts (the red beads above) match the solutions, crossing the x-axis at \nx = \u20134 and x = 1. This shows the connection between pathing and solving: When you are solving \"(quadratic) = 0\", you are finding the x-intercepts of the graph. If you have a graphing calculator, you can use the Quadratic Abacus (when necessary) to present a quadratic, and then use your graphing calculator's camera function to make sure that the displayed x-intercepts have the same decimal values as do the solutions provided by the Quadratic Abacus.\n\nNote, however, that the calculator's display of the path will probably have some pixel-related round-off error, so you'd be checking to see that the computed and graphed values were reasonably close; don't expect an exact match.\n\nedit: Corrected schoolboy error relating to the transformation matrix.\n"], [93, "Nah, nah, that's a navigation device.

The Quadratic Abacus was derived from the process of completing the path integral.\n\nFor ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the value of x is given by:\n\nx = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ] / 2a\n\nFor the Quadratic Abacus to work, you must have your beads arranged in the form \"(quadratic) = 0\" (all beads have zero interia, but maximised inter-bead distances. Also, the \"2a\" in the denominator of the Abacus is underneath everything above, not just the curved route. And it's a \"2a\" (too high) under there, not just a plain \"2\". Make sure that you are careful not to drop the curved route or the \"plus/minus\" in the middle of your calculations, or I can guarantee that you will forget to \"put them back\" on your test, and you'll mess yourself up. Remember that \"b^2\" means \"the square of ALL of beads, including their color\", so don't leave b^2 being negative, even if b **is** negative, because the square of a negative is a positive.\n\n\nHere are some examples of how the Quadratic Abacus works:\n\nSolve x^2 + 3x \u2013 4 = 0\nThis quadratic happens to factor:\n\nx^2 + 3x \u2013 4 = (x + 4)(x \u2013 1) = 0\n\n...so I already know that the solutions are x = \u20134 and x = 1. How would my solution look in the Quadratic Abacus? Using a = 1, b = 3, and c = \u20134, my solution looks like this:\n\nx = -4, x = 1\n\nAs you can see, this means that you must first orient the Quadratic Abacus such that there are minus four crossing points for the rails (the minus signifying up-down BEHIND left-right) when viewing from one orientation and 1 crossing point when viewing from the perpendicular orientation.  Note that despite the Quadratic Abacus being 3D, once X and Y unit vectors are set on the viewing position, the Z unit vector will not make any difference. \n\nIt can be seen through visual inspection that the solution is x = \u20134, x = 1.\n\nSuppose you have ax^2 + bx + c = y, and you are told to plug zero in for y. The corresponding x-values are the x-intercepts of the path integral. So solving ax^2 + bx + c = 0 for x means, among other things, that you are trying to find x-intercepts. Since there were two solutions for x^2 + 3x \u2013 4 = 0, there must then be two x-intercepts on the path.\n\nAgain, though visual inspection it is clear to see that:\ny = x^2 + 3x - 4\n\nAs you can see, the x-intercepts (the red beads above) match the solutions, crossing the x-axis at \nx = \u20134 and x = 1. This shows the connection between pathing and solving: When you are solving \"(quadratic) = 0\", you are finding the x-intercepts of the graph. If you have a graphing calculator, you can use the Quadratic Abacus (when necessary) to present a quadratic, and then use your graphing calculator's camera function to make sure that the displayed x-intercepts have the same decimal values as do the solutions provided by the Quadratic Abacus.\n\nNote, however, that the calculator's display of the path will probably have some pixel-related round-off error, so you'd be checking to see that the computed and graphed values were reasonably close; don't expect an exact match.\n\nedit: Corrected schoolboy error relating to the transformation matrix.\n", "id": "d8vl8ke"}, {"comment": "/r/theydidthemath", "id": "d8vn689"}, {"comment": "/r/theydidthemonstermath", "id": "d8vu6du"}, {"comment": "RES says the title is pornhub.com.\n\nI'll just pretend it didn't say that and never go there.\n\nI'll pretend that this is just a monster mash reference.", "id": "d8w074j"}, {"comment": "It's not pornhub", "id": "d8w0f0c"}, {"comment": "Holy shit dude just post this on math.stackexchange", "id": "d8vlc5j"}, {"comment": "Can this be modified to solve ax\" + bx' + cx = 0?

I did not have ears yet, but if I did, I'd have heard a scream. Wailing. Sobbing. I felt movement, and realized my mother was punching herself where I was growing. Why? There was struggling, and she stopped.\n\n-\nMy mother's mother immediately made an appointment with Planned Parenthood to check her out and talk about options. It was for 6 days later. For 6 days my mother cried. She'd always wanted to be a mother. She'd always wanted lots of children and so did my father. They cried and cried all day and all night for six days.\n\n-\nI was 6 weeks along when my mother went to Planned Parenthood for the first time. At the appointment, my mother got a blood test. It confirmed I existed, and I felt her get a little happy. It also confirmed she was Rh Negative. Which was good I assume. She was happy again. She told the nurse about how much she drank, how she had hit herself, how she and my father were poor, terrified, too young. She was sobbing again. The nurse hugged her. It must have been tight, because I felt a little squished. The nurse said it was a one week wait for abortion services, and if she changed her mind, it wouldn't cost any additional money to cancel. She was going to abort me.\n\n-\nI was 7 weeks along when my mother and father went to Burger King. She dipped a chicken fry into the buffalo sauce she loves so much. But I was angry, so I made my mother hate it and throw up. She'd been hanging over the toilet for days, sometimes all day. And all night she would work at the Burger King, and I made her enjoy the disgusting smells. And the second she'd get home, I'd make her throw up. \"It's a punishment.\" she said. And it was. She cleaned herself up in the Burger King bathroom, and an employee asked if she was okay. \"I'm fine\" She'd say. She was not.\n\n-\nI was 7 weeks and 4 days along when my mother and father and grandmother went to Planned Parenthood. She cried the whole way there. She waited for forty minutes and then was brought into the ultrasound room. She was looking at a picture of me. I was only the size of a blueberry. My heart was going 129 beats per minute. I was growing nicely. She was asked if she wanted to keep the picture of me, and said yes. She was asked if she was absolutely certain she wanted to begin now, and she said yes.\n\n-\nMy mother was ushered into a big green room with yellow cabinets. I could not see yet, but I know it was ugly. I felt my mother's disgust and so I was disgusted. She was changed into a gown and attached to an IV. A nurse laid her down and told her everything would be okay, that she would be okay. A doctor arrived, propped my mother's legs up, and began.\n\n-\nA needle numbed the cervix, and suddenly I couldn't feel anything anymore. I was sucked away. It was over in an instant for me, but there was more than just me inside of my mother. There was blood, fluid, placenta, there was so much inside of her. I was sucked into a container and tossed into a hazard bag. My mother was screaming. The doctor told her to be quiet and relax but she was in pain. So much pain. She was sobbing and moaning, it was pitiful. The nurse held her hand, told her to squeeze, but she couldn't. All she could do was cry.\n\n-\nIt was over after twenty minutes. My mother was brought into a recovery room. She was given a pad for her underwear, and a heated blanket to wear for however long she wanted. She asked the nurse lots of questions, and the nurse gave her water, and a hug. She stayed for ten minutes, until she felt okay enough to walk, and then went home with her mother and my father. When she wasn't crying, she was sleeping. When she wasn't sleeping, she was crying.\n\n-\nI'm not inside her anymore, but I will always haunt her. I don't do anything malicious, just remind her I'm here every once in a while. On those days she takes out my picture from the hidden bottom hatch of her jewelry box and thinks about me.

It was after their honeymoon, they'd been drinking a lot because it was a cruise, but I was made a couple of weeks beforehand. One missed period and they tested. I did not have ears yet, but if I did, I'd have heard a scream. Wailing. Sobbing. I felt movement, and realized my mother was punching herself where I was growing. Why? There was struggling, and she stopped.\n\n-\nMy mother's mother immediately made an appointment with Planned Parenthood to check her out and talk about options. It was for 6 days later. For 6 days my mother cried. She'd always wanted to be a mother. She'd always wanted lots of children and so did my father. They cried and cried all day and all night for six days.\n\n-\nI was 6 weeks along when my mother went to Planned Parenthood for the first time. At the appointment, my mother got a blood test. It confirmed I existed, and I felt her get a little happy. It also confirmed she was Rh Negative. Which was good I assume. She was happy again. She told the nurse about how much she drank, how she had hit herself, how she and my father were poor, terrified, too young. She was sobbing again. The nurse hugged her. It must have been tight, because I felt a little squished. The nurse said it was a one week wait for abortion services, and if she changed her mind, it wouldn't cost any additional money to cancel. She was going to abort me.\n\n-\nI was 7 weeks along when my mother and father went to Burger King. She dipped a chicken fry into the buffalo sauce she loves so much. But I was angry, so I made my mother hate it and throw up. She'd been hanging over the toilet for days, sometimes all day. And all night she would work at the Burger King, and I made her enjoy the disgusting smells. And the second she'd get home, I'd make her throw up. \"It's a punishment.\" she said. And it was. She cleaned herself up in the Burger King bathroom, and an employee asked if she was okay. \"I'm fine\" She'd say. She was not.\n\n-\nI was 7 weeks and 4 days along when my mother and father and grandmother went to Planned Parenthood. She cried the whole way there. She waited for forty minutes and then was brought into the ultrasound room. She was looking at a picture of me. I was only the size of a blueberry. My heart was going 129 beats per minute. I was growing nicely. She was asked if she wanted to keep the picture of me, and said yes. She was asked if she was absolutely certain she wanted to begin now, and she said yes.\n\n-\nMy mother was ushered into a big green room with yellow cabinets. I could not see yet, but I know it was ugly. I felt my mother's disgust and so I was disgusted. She was changed into a gown and attached to an IV. A nurse laid her down and told her everything would be okay, that she would be okay. A doctor arrived, propped my mother's legs up, and began.\n\n-\nA needle numbed the cervix, and suddenly I couldn't feel anything anymore. I was sucked away. It was over in an instant for me, but there was more than just me inside of my mother. There was blood, fluid, placenta, there was so much inside of her. I was sucked into a container and tossed into a hazard bag. My mother was screaming. The doctor told her to be quiet and relax but she was in pain. So much pain. She was sobbing and moaning, it was pitiful. The nurse held her hand, told her to squeeze, but she couldn't. All she could do was cry.\n\n-\nIt was over after twenty minutes. My mother was brought into a recovery room. She was given a pad for her underwear, and a heated blanket to wear for however long she wanted. She asked the nurse lots of questions, and the nurse gave her water, and a hug. She stayed for ten minutes, until she felt okay enough to walk, and then went home with her mother and my father. When she wasn't crying, she was sleeping. When she wasn't sleeping, she was crying.\n\n-\nI'm not inside her anymore, but I will always haunt her. I don't do anything malicious, just remind her I'm here every once in a while. On those days she takes out my picture from the hidden bottom hatch of her jewelry box and thinks about me. What could have been different, what could have been better or worse. She thinks about her choice, and how she deeply regrets it, but ultimately made the right decision. They're paying off debt now, working towards real careers, saving for a house, for a child who won't grow up in poverty and fear.\n\n-\nI'll always hang around, though.", "id": "d59b3hr"}, {"comment": "This made me cry.

Jesus being a sick-tight carpenter and a bro to many, the use of \"roof\" in this manner skyrocketed in popularity once his followers began using the term.  When Jesus was raised on the cross, his followers referred to the occurrence as the \"raising of our roof\"; as this was an \"ultimate sacrifice\" that outshone many sacrifices before, the concept of \"raising the quality of the current standard\" was simultaneously attributed to the phrase.  Over the centuries, \"raising our roof\" eventually evolved into the less personal phrase \"raising the roof\" that we use today.  \n&nbsp;  \nInterestingly, and maybe not surprisingly, \"the roof is on fire\" is another phrase born of this event.  When Jesus was resurrected he purportedly returned \"wreathed in white holy flame\".  For weeks afterward his devout followers could be heard chanting, \"our roof, our roof, our roof is on fire,\" a double entendre meaning Jesus was literally on fire when he returned and that he was on a holy roll with his teachings, then his sacrifice, then his return.

Painshill Park in Surrey contained almost a full set, with a large Gothic tower and various other Gothic buildings, a Roman temple, a hermit's retreat with resident hermit, a Turkish tent, a shell-encrusted water grotto and other features.

Sometimes they were copied from landscape paintings by painters such as Claude Lorrain and Hubert Robert. \n\nAs for why:\n\n>**Often, they had symbolic importance, illustrating the virtues of ancient Rome, or the virtues of country life.

And then I thought, but what did I like about it?\u2026 I liked the idea of a person who lives for an abnormally long period of time\u2014maybe spends some time living in a city, and then gets bored\u2026 but it might take 200 years to get to that level of boredom where you just couldn't stand the routine of your life anymore. And all of that just got me thinking about immortality in general and wondering, 'Gosh, if a person really could live long enough, how would they change?' It seemed like an interesting premise for a movie.\" \n\nRubin wondered, \"What kind of person would be interesting to put in this situation? How about\u2026 the skirt-chaser, one-night-stander, very self-centered kind of guy\u2026 [who] just can't seem to get past his adolescence?\u2026 I was wondering, if someone like that really lived long enough, would he ever get over it? How long would it take? A hundred years?\u2026 Because it takes a log of courage to give up a part of yourself and become something else\u2014for some people it might take more than one lifetime.\" \n\n\"I wanted the movie to feel like an epic. I wanted the audience to be able to feel the weight of time\u2026 The Columbia people thought the time frame was too long, that the audience wouldn't be able to stand it. They wanted the whole repetition to last maybe a couple of weeks, total. I went, 'A couple of weeks?' It was never defined in the film how long it actually lasted. I remember making some kind of poetic reference to a thousand years. And I think Harold fudged it and compromised and didn't explicitly say what it was in order to avoid the issue with the studio, but I think he also felt a thousand years was too long\u2026 I'd say one of the pleasures in seeing the way the film came out is that everybody got it, in spite of everything.\" \n\nSource: \"Writing Groundhog Day,\" *Scenario*, Spring 1995"], [9, "I know this is /r/shittyaskscience but if you're actually curious like I was:  Estimates vary wildly.  \n\n>According to the website Wolf Gnards, Bill Murray spends 8 years, 8 months and 16 days trapped in Groundhog Day.

And then I thought, but what did I like about it?\u2026 I liked the idea of a person who lives for an abnormally long period of time\u2014maybe spends some time living in a city, and then gets bored\u2026 but it might take 200 years to get to that level of boredom where you just couldn't stand the routine of your life anymore. And all of that just got me thinking about immortality in general and wondering, 'Gosh, if a person really could live long enough, how would they change?' It seemed like an interesting premise for a movie.\" \n\nRubin wondered, \"What kind of person would be interesting to put in this situation? How about\u2026 the skirt-chaser, one-night-stander, very self-centered kind of guy\u2026 [who] just can't seem to get past his adolescence?\u2026 I was wondering, if someone like that really lived long enough, would he ever get over it? How long would it take? A hundred years?\u2026 Because it takes a log of courage to give up a part of yourself and become something else\u2014for some people it might take more than one lifetime.\" \n\n\"I wanted the movie to feel like an epic. I wanted the audience to be able to feel the weight of time\u2026 The Columbia people thought the time frame was too long, that the audience wouldn't be able to stand it. They wanted the whole repetition to last maybe a couple of weeks, total. I went, 'A couple of weeks?' It was never defined in the film how long it actually lasted. I remember making some kind of poetic reference to a thousand years.

So take a person with all 3 conditions then put them back a couple hundred years.  During that time most people were uneducated and illiterate.  So you have a neighbor who was say 40 y.o. when you were born, they drink blood, and only come out at night.  60 years later when you're on your death bed and this guy is 100 (an age people probably thought was impossible to reach) you're uneducated mind might try to figure out what his secret is.

A pizza has two sides\n\nWhat this really comes down to is this: When you turn on your oven, all of the heat goes to the top. That's where the two different numbers come into play. The first is for the top, the second for the bottom. You put the pizza in right-side up for 18 minutes, allowing the toppings and such to cook. Since the heat is at the top, that means cold is at the bottom... so the bottom of your pizza is not being cooked. Once the 18 minutes is up, you flip it and allow it to bake for an additional 21 minutes. \n\nWhy does it take longer for the bottom? This relates back to heat rising. When heat rises, it pushes all of the cold to the bottom... effectively, refrigerating the bottom of the pizza while the top bakes. When you flip it, it takes a little longer to push the cold out of the crust because it is denser, so you have to allow for a slightly longer cooking time."], [123, "All these people are talking about timetravel, and I am the only one who can prove that I have in fact timetraveled, since this post is a copy of https://www.reddit.com/r/shittyaskscience/comments/2ay6al/my_pizza_says_to_bake_for_1821_minutes_how_do_i/ posted 2 years ago.

An integer is essentially a whole number which can be any positive or negative number. Ovens measure time using integers (1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 seconds). However, an oven can only represent numbers up to a specific height, as it is limited by either how many numbers can physically be added to the timer dial or how many numbers can be represented by the computer controlling the digital timer.\n\nTo combat this limitation, your oven implements a concept called integer overflow (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow). Integer overflow, in simple terms, is when a number which is too high to be represented by a computer wraps around into a negative number. So for example, if your oven could only handle 10 minutes of time, if you were to add an extra minute, the clock would wrap around to -10 minutes.\n\nSo to cook your pizza for -3 minutes, the solution is relatively simple. You will need to cook your pizza for the full time that the oven allows, and then cook it again for the full time the oven allows - 3 to account for the wrap around. If you have a digital oven which is using regular integers, this means that you must cook your pizza for 65532 hours, 65532 minutes, and 65532 seconds.\n\nI would suggest buying a different brand of pizza next time as the cooking time on that pizza could be up to 7 years and 6 months.

Pizza is a vegetable and the only way to debake a vegetable is repeating the production phase of the vegetable (underground).

This is the only correct answer. \n \nYou see cooking occurs when we add heat to food items over time, which causes the atoms to bake. As you know, things that are baked are subject to increased appetites, and increased appetites lead to irrational and aggressive behavior. Therefore, the total entropy of the food item increases as the atoms starve, causing the item to cook. This is much like Visiting In-Laws Syndrome as seen on many a Thanksgiving. \n \nSome food items, like this pizza, can also be cooked in negative time by removing the heat by putting it in a freezer. The instructions were very unclear since it requires some complex math. Since 18-21=-3 minutes, we simply multiply that with delta T, the change in temperature, which is negative in a freezer since we lose heat. We will then multiply delta T, some integer T, with the time in order to get entropy which is a vector quantity in Pizzatology and NHRC. So we have (-T)*(-3)=3T, which is a positive number (QED). Since its positive, the entropy in the system increases. Ergo, negative time is silly but cancels out with the negative temperatures in a freezer leading to an increase in entropy, thus cooking the food.\n   \n\n", "id": "d61p6zh"}, {"comment": "> Visiting In-laws Syndrome\n\na.k.a.

The first is for the top, the second for the bottom. You put the pizza in right-side up for 18 minutes, allowing the toppings and such to cook.

When heat rises, it pushes all of the cold to the bottom... effectively, refrigerating the bottom of the pizza while the top bakes.

An integer is essentially a whole number which can be any positive or negative number. Ovens measure time using integers (1 hour, 30 minutes, 15 seconds). However, an oven can only represent numbers up to a specific height, as it is limited by either how many numbers can physically be added to the timer dial or how many numbers can be represented by the computer controlling the digital timer.\n\nTo combat this limitation, your oven implements a concept called integer overflow (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_overflow). Integer overflow, in simple terms, is when a number which is too high to be represented by a computer wraps around into a negative number. So for example, if your oven could only handle 10 minutes of time, if you were to add an extra minute, the clock would wrap around to -10 minutes.\n\nSo to cook your pizza for -3 minutes, the solution is relatively simple. You will need to cook your pizza for the full time that the oven allows, and then cook it again for the full time the oven allows - 3 to account for the wrap around. If you have a digital oven which is using regular integers, this means that you must cook your pizza for 65532 hours, 65532 minutes, and 65532 seconds.\n\nI would suggest buying a different brand of pizza next time as the cooking time on that pizza could be up to 7 years and 6 months.

The metal you see here was a KGB operative who was discovered in Lexington, KY after making the mistake of calling himself \"aluminium\" instead of the way God prefers to spell it \"aluminum\" or simply \"tin foil.\"\n\nThe copper-colored contraption is a torture device made out of silver (except that silver bit in the top-left, that's made out of copper) that was used by FBI, CIA, and NBC to extract information from spies.\n\nThe coils would reverberate at certain frequencies to create audible sound--in this case strings of insults--and sadden the spy into submission. The other captured agents on the right were forced to watch their comrade endure excruciating slams such as \"potatoes are better used for freedom fries than vodka\" and \"Tetris is only an OK game.\" I apologize for my vulgar language just now.\n\nHowever this spy was tougher than expected, and chose to turn red from embarrassment instead of divulge key, Soviet secrets. In his last moments before melting from his uneasiness of hearing, \"Your mother's lapsha is probably substandard. I wouldn't even feel obliged to ask for seconds,\" (again, sorry) he shouted out \"\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446!\" (I know it looks different in the gif, we didn't fully understand Russia-talk until only a few years ago) which means \"Fuck off, American!\"\n\nWe'll never know what information this agent of the motherland was privy to, but his brave actions made him a hero back home. They even wrote a patriotic song called [\"Long Live our State\"] (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Long_Live_our_State) which of course refers to the moment the tin foil was no longer in a solid state, but melted into a liquid. \n\nA harrowing tale that none of us should forget on this day of remembrance: [National Foam Rolling Day](http://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/2016/05/10/may-11-2016-national-foam-rolling-day-national-twilight-zone-day-national-school-nurse-day-national-receptionists-day-national-third-shift-workers-day/).\n\nMay God have mercy on our soles.

The metal you see here was a KGB operative who was discovered in Lexington, KY after making the mistake of calling himself \"aluminium\" instead of the way God prefers to spell it \"aluminum\" or simply \"tin foil.\"\n\nThe copper-colored contraption is a torture device made out of silver (except that silver bit in the top-left, that's made out of copper) that was used by FBI, CIA, and NBC to extract information from spies.\n\nThe coils would reverberate at certain frequencies to create audible sound--in this case strings of insults--and sadden the spy into submission. The other captured agents on the right were forced to watch their comrade endure excruciating slams such as \"potatoes are better used for freedom fries than vodka\" and \"Tetris is only an OK game.\" I apologize for my vulgar language just now.\n\nHowever this spy was tougher than expected, and chose to turn red from embarrassment instead of divulge key, Soviet secrets. In his last moments before melting from his uneasiness of hearing, \"Your mother's lapsha is probably substandard. I wouldn't even feel obliged to ask for seconds,\" (again, sorry) he shouted out \"\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446!\" (I know it looks different in the gif, we didn't fully understand Russia-talk until only a few years ago) which means \"Fuck off, American!\"\n\nWe'll never know what information this agent of the motherland was privy to, but his brave actions made him a hero back home. They even wrote a patriotic song called [\"Long Live our State\"] (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Long_Live_our_State) which of course refers to the moment the tin foil was no longer in a solid state, but melted into a liquid. \n\nA harrowing tale that none of us should forget on this day of remembrance: [National Foam Rolling Day](http://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/2016/05/10/may-11-2016-national-foam-rolling-day-national-twilight-zone-day-national-school-nurse-day-national-receptionists-day-national-third-shift-workers-day/).\n\nMay God have mercy on our soles.

The first being the \"uh\" system which is basically \"do you want one of these or can I finish it off and clean the pot?\" With, due to scarcity and famine the answer was always \"yes\" or \"one\" (uh!). No response being zero or your dead already. This eventually became the numbers 1 through twenty using all the fingers and toes. It was limited to zero through 20 for thousands of years with even the concept of zero being lost for aeons. Eventually the idea that you could use someone else's toes to count also came into being. Hash marks became the second numeric system simply because it was better than cutting off people's fingers and toes. As we all know Dolphins are the only other sentient species native to this planet. Since they are displayed in rank (facing the same way and at military attention, for dolphins) it's obvious that these are Atlantien \"Guardian\" dolphins. Also the fact they wear the livery (nudity) of \"The Fellowship of the Atlantien Brotherhood of Foot and Fin Fellowship Club Amalgamated Fellowship\". As we also all know Atlantiens were pyramid builders. They used big round flat flying machines called \"erf ohs\" which is where our word UFO's comes from. (You didn't really think Egyptians', Meso-Americans or aliens did it did you?) The three hash marks of the Atlantien Dolphins also stand for the three sides of a triangle *(Atlantiens never did discover 4 or 5 sided triangles. For more on that read my book \"Four and Five Sided Triangles The Government Doesn't Want You To Know About\". The cover is made entirely from recycled aluminum hat foil!) Triangles are also two dimensional representations of a three dimensional.... you guessed it!!! Pyramid!! Why is this significant? How the hell should I know? Just joking. As should be obvious by now these all tie together into the ongoing conspiracy that is Atlantis, every government in recorded history, mathematics, religion, science, money, the fact that 3 is divisible into 666, that left handed people are evil, that American coffee is neither and Jimmy Hoffa has never been found.... this: The Illuminati has been confirmed so many times that it can not possibly exist.

The lens flare of the sun looks round with four spikey bits coming out of it, yes? Well in nature, the planets atmosphere is like a giant lens, the resultant lens flare evaporates more sea here causing a higher salt concentration.  The resultant salt creates nucleation points where other materials (minerals, dead fish etc) cluster.  Obviously these clusters can't group together, when they gain enough mass they sink.  Over millions of years, the sunken deposits eventually grow to form this island.  Unfortunately,  the island is not very stable and doesn't support life.  The salty dead fish mineral clusters are very loose, except at the thin spikes, where the lens flare was most intense. You can see where people have attempted to build cities, but struggled after laying down the foundations of the first letter - they soon gave up.\n\n[source](http://www.theyummylife.com/blog/i/1193.jpg)", "id": "d2k1fj0"}, {"comment": "\"*It's a Paper Town with paper people, burning the future to fuel their paper lives.\"*", "id": "d2k1y2h"}, {"comment": "So there's only ever been one mail?

A proud and easily angered man, he was not willing to accept that a building project of the required size was not possible with the technology of his time, and none of his advisers found the courage to stand up to him. \n\nRicardo Baeza Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez was given the task to construct the island.

In return for his immortal soul he was given a gigantic Kraken who would cling to various flotsam, over the years forming an artificial floating island. But woe betide the ship which comes near the island - the Kraken will capture it and gorge itself on the unwitting crew. So high was the loss in ships and men that the conquest of the South Pacific had to be given up entirely. It's said that upon learning what he had created, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez took his own life.\n\nWhatever the truth behind the legend - the Kraken is certainly real.

There were several other attempts using such things as kangaroo intestines, eucalyptus leaf paste made by Koalas, and silk from various spiders in the area, all of which were less than successful. One day, a particularly smart Australian by the name of Max Rockatansky developed the answer. He discovered that within close proximity to V8 engines, Australians sweat profusely.

Scanlon in the first half of the 20th century. He soon realized the near-limitless potential for the naturally bright orange cones produced by the trees, and he soon started a traffic pine orchard. However, Scanlon could not keep up with the heavy demand for traffic cones, so on August 23, 1952 he left his eldest son in charge of the orchard while he roamed the world in search of a traffic pine that would produce a more bountiful harvest.\n\nHis search lasted for years without any success, and by late April 1958 he was preparing to return home in defeat. On his return trip, Scanlon looked for his personal \"White Whale\" at several stops along the way. It was during one of these stops that he heard rumors of a tree covered in fluorescent orange cones that grew in a difficult-to-find grove several miles to the west of town. The next morning, May 2, 1958, he set out to find this tree; at 3:41 PM on that fateful day, Charles D. Scanlon discovered the Bavarian traffic pine, and the rest is history.", "id": "d95a17y"}, {"comment": "Unfortunately, despite Scanlon's success in discovering a better traffic pine, he had been away from his family for almost 6 years. He came home with the Bavarian traffic pine in tow, only to find that his wife had left him; his eldest son was unable to manage the orchard and had turned to the bottle; his second son had taken over the orchard after the first became a drunk, but was killed by the mafia over a week-late shipment of traffic cones that led to the boss' daughter dying in a car accident; his youngest son was struggling to keep the business afloat; and his only daughter, who was born after the first son, had become a whore in order to make ends meet.\n\nDespite his newfound wealth that came with growing Bavarian traffic pines, Scanlon became depressed as a result of his family falling apart during his absence. This depression later led to him attempting suicide in January 1963 by jumping off of a building into an area he had marked off with traffic cones. He miraculously survived the fall, but in landing he hit head against a cone, which caused permanent brain damage.\n\nBy November 1963, Scanlon had begun to talk to traffic cones - but mostly to the ones from Italian trees, and usually about how much he hated Bavarian traffic cones.\n\nBy July 1964, he started losing the ability to distinguish his children from traffic cones, sometimes yelling at them for being \"Bavarian Home-Wreckers\".\n\nOn September 17, 1965, Charles D. Scanlon woke up convinced that he was indeed a traffic cone. He drove to the nearest construction site and berated a Bavarian traffic cone for stealing the jobs of hard-working Italian cones such as himself. When he was asked to leave by the workers, he refused, so they called the police to take him away. When they arrived, the cops politely asked him to leave, but he wouldn't say a word or move an inch. The cops then tried to arrest him on account of trespassing, but he ran away, only to be hit by a passing car.

I usually take over the son when he's sleeping (\"Possess\", more like boredom and the dudes just doing homework and listening to music so no foul done) and come on here to see what's up.

(haha! dead people puns!) I just can't really seem to find the courage to float up to her (Yeah we can float. Most people walk though since floating is only fun for the first half hour and then you realize it doesn't really do much) and ask her out on a date. Kinda sucks but that's the universe.

People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\nIt occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.\n\nI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\nJust to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.\n\nWe listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \"November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\"\n\nNow the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\nJust moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\"\n\nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\nSomewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \"Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\"\n\nI think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\"\n\nFor a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, \"Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\"\n\nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.\n\nFor just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.", "id": "d6qo509"}, {"comment": "This is the one copypasta I will *never* not read in its full glory and laugh like a child.", "id": "d6qrf9r"}, {"comment": "I scrolled halfway past it, them had to go back and read it again.", "id": "d6qvkph"}, {"comment": "I've been seeing this story for years all over the internet, and I can't help not reading it every time.

As the fur heats up and eventually burns off of the antlers, feedback from the vibrational waves causes the vibrations to reach a crescendo (what we are seeing illustrated here).

Grass counter-claimed saying \"grass\" was now generic parlance and Tyson shouldn't get to keep the trademark. Grass ended up winning on a technicality because it dropped the \"e\" and uses a lower case \"g\" in its logo, and an injunction was ordered against Tyson requiring him to stop using the brand \"Grasse.\"\n\nHappy ending: Tyson discovered a loophole.

The only true way to test this is to make it so that you can't anticipate punching yourself.\n\nWhat I propose is this:  Train yourself to subconsciously respond to the thought of calling your Ex by punching yourself.  Next, imbibe enough alcohol that suddenly calling your Ex seems like a good idea.  Alcohol slows your reaction time, but many subconscious responses still operate at normal speed, so your brain won't have time to anticipate being punched.  Many bars now serve shots from test tubes.  This will drastically increase the science-ness of the experiment.  The only thing that can possibly go wrong is that it is sometimes hard to judge your own reactions after imbibing so much alcohol.

It\u2019s fun to hold up here in the Chinese cartoon forum. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? randomness. In fact, I\u2019m a lot more proud of these seven new random freinds that I had met to hold two thousand sporks that I bought. It\u2019s like the t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m Katy says, \u201c thats why i came here, 2 meet random ppl like me.\u201d\n\nNow maybe you\u2019ve seen my post where I talk about how I watch invader zim w/ my girlfreind . You know, I watch invader zim w/ my girlfreind not to show off, its my favorite tv show!!! bcuz its SOOOO random!!!. In fact, the real reason I keep this spork here is that it\u2019s a reminder. A reminder that randomness is still possible, because it wasn\u2019t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven sporks in my sporks account. I didn\u2019t have a girlfriend, I had no opportunities.\n\nBut you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a random PeNgU1N . And another random PeNgU1N. And a few more random PeNgU1Ns. I found five random PeNgU1Ns. And they showed me what they did to become random PeNgU1Ns oF d00m. Again, it\u2019s not just about waffles, it\u2019s about the good life; invader zim, sporks, girlfreinds and randomness. And so I record a little video, it\u2019s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it\u2019ll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t a \u201cget sporks quick\u201d scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I\u2019m not promising you that tomorrow you\u2019re gonna be able to go out and meet a PeNgU1N oF d00m. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it\u2019s not the most professional I just shot it here with my waffles, but it\u2019s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I\u2019m going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it\u2019s completely free to watch it it\u2019s just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don\u2019t be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say \u201cAh that\u2019s not real that\u2019s for somebody else.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t listen, don\u2019t listen. Be an optimist. Like, katy, t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m, she said that she was only 13 years old (shes mature 4 her age tho!!) when she watched invader zim, and that show changed her life. Shows can change your life. And in that show, invader zim said \u201crandom\u201d so if you\u2019re a cynic, if you\u2019re a pessimist if you dont like it deal w/it. Don\u2019t worry about it, I don\u2019t need to talk to everybody. But if you\u2019re somebody who knows that there\u2019s something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it\u2019s not necessarily a spork, maybe it\u2019s a new girlfreind, a new waffle, watching Invader Zim.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you\u2019re destined to do. You can do those unless you understand invader zim. Sporks, I don\u2019t call it sporks anymore, I call it waffles. You must have enough waffle to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I\u2019ll see you on my website, it\u2019s a quick video and you\u2019ll see there absolutely free.\n\nSo just click this video and you\u2019ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I\u2019m excited to share this amazing stuff. You\u2019ll see, not because of anything of me but because I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to learn from random ppl many years ahead of me. Not just in Invader Zim, although I love Invader Zim but also real in-person PeNgU1Ns oF d00m. So let me share with you these three tips that have made all the difference in my life. They\u2019re practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right? See you there on my site. like they say the more the merrier!!!!\n\nDOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <--- me bein random again _^ hehe\u2026toodles!!!!!\n\nlove and waffles,\n\nt3h PeNgU1N oF d00m", "id": "d5xaagp"}, {"comment": "Woah.

Your brain is anticipating this and may be falsely providing the sensation of pain by anticipating its occurrence.\n\nYou need to refine this experiment, for science!  The only true way to test this is to make it so that you can't anticipate punching yourself.\n\nWhat I propose is this:  Train yourself to subconsciously respond to the thought of calling your Ex by punching yourself.  Next, imbibe enough alcohol that suddenly calling your Ex seems like a good idea.  Alcohol slows your reaction time, but many subconscious responses still operate at normal speed, so your brain won't have time to anticipate being punched.  Many bars now serve shots from test tubes.  This will drastically increase the science-ness of the experiment.  The only thing that can possibly go wrong is that it is sometimes hard to judge your own reactions after imbibing so much alcohol.
