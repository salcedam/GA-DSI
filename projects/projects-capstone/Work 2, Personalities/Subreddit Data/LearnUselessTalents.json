You can't have a conversation with someone on the internet without angrily clicking the downvote button? Do you feel like you've had vengeance on me or something? I personally don't care about downvotes either way (by all means, call your silly downvote brigade on me, it means nothing at all to me), but I just find it funny how seriously you and others like yourself actually take these imaginary internet points. Reddit really is all you have, huh? Damn do I feel bad for you. But you know what? I don\u2019t care! I\u2019ll rake in the coal! You\u2019re logic is flawed, kiddo.

Downvote away, downvote to your heart's content. But listen kid, please remember rule 1 of reddit. Treat the other people commenting as if they are human beings. It is fascinating, however, that people ignore the fact that I am right just because the first two people downvoted me. From that point it is just snowballs. When people see downvotes, do they neglect their own ability or reason? It is similar to the fallacy of poisoning the well. Once they see the fact that others disagree, they assume that the person must be wrong, even if undeniable truth is on the other side. It is an interesting phenomenon, and I am not sure how reddit should address this issue moving forward. There needs to be a solution that prevents cases like mine from happening. If someone posts something truthful, it should be upvoted, not downvoted. It is imperative that the truth to be shared. I don\u2019t care about the karma. Hell, I\u2019ll gladly rake in the coal!

Get some boots, that way you can put your hands in and shove the pants in there too. Next you want to get some pretty big pants, I had a pair lying around for some reason. How did I see, they were very thin so I could kinda see through it, and even though they were very thin it was still hard to breath.(I wore this thing for about 3 hours, my hands were killing me) Now you need to find a big long sleeve shirt, or a hoodie, It needs to be long enough to cover your legs and get a little bit higher than your nipples, when I wore this the pants reached me a little bit past the neck, and the hoodie is what did all the magic. To make sure it doesn't come off and is as comfortable as possible, I added suspenders to the hoodie so I wouldn't have to worry about it coming off. Now I used a hoodie so I could easily  put a foam ball between my legs with a mask on to pretend like it's my head. And finally the easiest part was just finding some gloves big enough to put on/cover my shoes.\n\nHonestly the hardest part was finding a pair of pants and a sweatshirt for exactly what I needed. Everything else is a cake walk. Start by putting on some short pants and shirt. Next put on the sweatshirt and secure it. Put on shoes, add gloves to the shoes.

The guy in this video pushes back a lot more than i like, but still no one seems to notice)\n\n> That's the way to find freedom.\n\n(I continue to keep the back and forth motion along the stationary band, but pull back in a sort of zigzag show that we're free)\n\nI can do this silently and the visual magic speaks for itself, but i like stories and if you find some words you like to tell a story about what people are seeing, it adds a layer of distraction and a kind of hypnosis.\n\nI've also heard people talk about finding the soft spot in the rubber band where it can melt through.", "id": "d9m6zmn"}, {"comment": "I read all of the little bits of your spiel in David Blaine's voice btw.", "id": "d9mghge"}, {"comment": "That's wonderful... and a bit hilarious.

Foot-in-the-door phenomenon, People are more likely to agree to do a task for you if you ask them to do something simpler first (Gradual commitment makes people think you like them). Alternatively, you ask them to do an unreasonable task and they\u2019ll say no. So then you should ask for a more reasonable task and they will be more likely to agree.\n> \n> 4. Remembering Names, if you can get into the habit of not only remembering someone\u2019s name when you first meet them, but using their name in the subsequent conversation you have, they\u2019ll find you terribly charming and wonderful. Isn\u2019t that awesome?\n> \n> 5. When laughter breaks out in a group of people, each one will instinctively glance at whichever other individual they feel closest to in that group. This is a good way of spotting who is more closer to whom in the group.\n> \n> 6. Chew gum when you\u2019re approaching a situation that would make you nervous like public speaking or bungee jumping. If we are \u2018eating\u2019 something, our brain trips and it reasons \u201cI would not be eating if I were danger. So I\u2019m not in danger\u2019\u2019.\n> \n> 7. People\u2019s feet are often an insight into what they\u2019re thinking.

Similarly if you\u2019re talking to someone and their torso is turned towards you but their feet are facing in another direction, they want the conversation to end.\n> \n> 8. Use the power of silence, If someone gives you an unsatisfactory answer to a question, stay quiet and keep eye contact and they\u2019ll usually feel pressured to keep talking and reveal more.\n> \n> 9. Alter your psychological state before an interview or important meeting. Tell yourself \u201cI\u2019ve known these people all my life. We\u2019re old friends catching up. I can\u2019t wait to see them.\u2019\u2019 Visualize the experience of shaking hands, making eye contact, and having smooth conversation. What things can you not to wait to tell them? Hold an open pose, stand with your legs apart, hands on your hips, and shoulders back while doing this and SMILE. This may sound cliche, but you are in charge of your own psychological state and the power of suggestion is strong.\n> \n> 10. The best way to learn, is to teach, If you\u2019re acquiring a new skill or piece of knowledge, bore someone else with it at the first opportunity you get.\n> \n> 11. People will remember not what you said but how you made them feel. Also most people like talking about themselves so ask lots of questions about them.\n> \n> 12. Refer to people you\u2019ve just met by their name, People love being referred to by their name, and it will establish a sense of trust and friendship right away. Say your friend introduced you to Mark. After 5 minutes he decides to leave. Don\u2019t just say, \u201cbye\u201d, but instead say \u201cBye Mark!\u201d\n> \n> 13. Mirroring people\u2019s body language when you interact with them is a way of building up trust. Just be cautious about it.\n> \n> 14. False attribution of arousal.

If we are \u2018eating\u2019 something, our brain trips and it reasons \u201cI would not be eating if I were danger. So I\u2019m not in danger\u2019\u2019.\n> \n> 7. People\u2019s feet are often an insight into what they\u2019re thinking. For example, if you approach two people talking and they turn their torso to you but not their feet, they\u2019d prefer you leave them alone. Similarly if you\u2019re talking to someone and their torso is turned towards you but their feet are facing in another direction, they want the conversation to end.\n> \n> 8. Use the power of silence, If someone gives you an unsatisfactory answer to a question, stay quiet and keep eye contact and they\u2019ll usually feel pressured to keep talking and reveal more.\n> \n> 9. Alter your psychological state before an interview or important meeting. Tell yourself \u201cI\u2019ve known these people all my life. We\u2019re old friends catching up. I can\u2019t wait to see them.\u2019\u2019 Visualize the experience of shaking hands, making eye contact, and having smooth conversation. What things can you not to wait to tell them? Hold an open pose, stand with your legs apart, hands on your hips, and shoulders back while doing this and SMILE. This may sound cliche, but you are in charge of your own psychological state and the power of suggestion is strong.\n> \n> 10. The best way to learn, is to teach, If you\u2019re acquiring a new skill or piece of knowledge, bore someone else with it at the first opportunity you get.\n> \n> 11. People will remember not what you said but how you made them feel. Also most people like talking about themselves so ask lots of questions about them.\n> \n> 12. Refer to people you\u2019ve just met by their name, People love being referred to by their name, and it will establish a sense of trust and friendship right away. Say your friend introduced you to Mark. After 5 minutes he decides to leave. Don\u2019t just say, \u201cbye\u201d, but instead say \u201cBye Mark!\u201d\n> \n> 13. Mirroring people\u2019s body language when you interact with them is a way of building up trust. Just be cautious about it.\n> \n> 14. False attribution of arousal. When you take somebody out on a first date, take them somewhere exciting that will get their heart beating such as a roller coaster or horror film. This gets their adrenaline up. It makes them think they enjoy spending time with you rather than the activity.\n> \n> 15. If you make the biggest smile you can, you will automatically feel happier.

You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.\n\nMore importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in the possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit, etc etc.  Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker may accidentally have \u201clost\u201d.  What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still know where his towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.\n\nBRB, buying a towel, instead of using rags to dry myself as I have been doing so far.", "id": "d5rjmgo"}, {"comment": "Think of it as a cheap decoration instead of a waste of pasta. $5 on pasta and $5 on Ikea jars will easily fill up the space.

Pour milk into it for all I care. But if you are ordering/drinking an expensive single malt or craft bourbon, you should know that water and ice *will* dilute the taste. That's not an opinion, that's a plain fact. And if you're going to dilute the taste with cold and water, you'd get roughly the same experience with a cheaper scotch or bourbon.\n\nIt just doesn't make much sense to order a $20 single malt on the rocks when it's going to taste similar to an $8 blended scotch on the rocks.\n\nThe OP is correct regarding water and higher proof (+100 proof) whiskys, you will want to (and are supposed to) dilute it a little bit with water. But these cask strength whiskys are rarely in bars to begin with. Maybe upscale whisky bars? I've never seen one on the menu."], [2, "I think you hit the (rusty?) nail on the head - it's about finding what you like, irrespective of what the social norm is.\n\nI'm in the UK - typically there's a (whiskey branded) jug of water on the bar in pubs - such that people can dilute their own whiskey.  Some believe that a little dilution opens up the drink.  I personally don't use these.\n\nMy preference is to have my whiskey chilled - and often use the frozen soapstone rocks to chill the drink.  \n\nI don't mind a bit of dilution either - so sometimes pop a spherical lump of ice in my malt.\n\nSteak - I'll have that medium rare!

I would add:\n\n* \"*Please*\" and \"*thank you*\" are as mandatory as payment for the drink.\n* Asking for extra (for free) will often get you less for more.\n* If you're about to order, have your money out and know what you want to get BEFORE the bartender speaks to you.\n* (Optional) It doesn't hurt to have a backup prepared if for whatever reason your first choice(s) are unavailable."], [2, "Bartender here:\n\nMake direct eye contact with the bartender. Wait your turn. Know what you want before you speak to him. Have your cash ready. If you want to use a credit card, fine, but if you even remotely plan on using it more than once, start a tab.\n\nTip really well the first round and you will get faster service, guaranteed. Tip appropriately afterwards. If it's not busy, feel free to ask questions and learn from the bartender, if it's busy and he's in the weeds, it's not the time for questions.\n\nWant to know whats on tap? Look at the taps. Want to know the specials? Look at the signs that are most likely posted at the entrance, behind the bartender, or on drink menus that are littered around the restaurant.\n\nNo, the bartender cannot \"hook you up\" or \"make it a strong one\", that's product. You wouldn't ask a grocery store clerk to \"hook it up\". If you are receiving good service, tip accordingly, or even buy the bartender a drink, and he might promo a round for you.\n\nIf you run a big tab and don't tip, or tip poorly, you shouldn't go back to that bar, and you should realise that servers/bartenders live on tips. Don't agree with tipping culture? Fine. Don't go to bars/restaurants. Don't have money for the tip? Then you didn't have money to drink in the first place. Don't like that sentiment? Move out of north America. That's the way it is here, and it's a very nuanced issue that won't change any time soon.\n\nThis is just me, not all bartenders feel this way: if you're in a club, or ordering from a  slammed bar, don't order a daquiri or mojito or some shit. Want time-intensive cocktails? Get a table and the server can bring that order to the service bar. If your order a mojito, yeah I'll make it, with a smile on my face, but the next time I see you come up I'll be sure to get others out of the way first.\n\nI've been bartending for 10 years now and these are just a few things that come to mind.

YMMV on whether you like this. At different points, these ice chips have been both frowned upon and made into a fad in certain bartending circles.\n- Shaking adds tiny air bubbles to your drink, which changes the flavor and texture. I would guess that this is what \"bruising\" refers to, but \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Again, YMMV, but there is a reason some drinks are traditionally stirred while others are traditionally shaken.\n\nStirring gives a smoother, more velvety texture that is more appropriate for drinks that only contain booze.

Tip appropriately afterwards.

Want to know the specials? Look at the signs that are most likely posted at the entrance, behind the bartender, or on drink menus that are littered around the restaurant.\n\nNo, the bartender cannot \"hook you up\" or \"make it a strong one\", that's product. You wouldn't ask a grocery store clerk to \"hook it up\". If you are receiving good service, tip accordingly, or even buy the bartender a drink, and he might promo a round for you.\n\nIf you run a big tab and don't tip, or tip poorly, you shouldn't go back to that bar, and you should realise that servers/bartenders live on tips. Don't agree with tipping culture? Fine. Don't go to bars/restaurants. Don't have money for the tip? Then you didn't have money to drink in the first place. Don't like that sentiment? Move out of north America. That's the way it is here, and it's a very nuanced issue that won't change any time soon.\n\nThis is just me, not all bartenders feel this way: if you're in a club, or ordering from a  slammed bar, don't order a daquiri or mojito or some shit. Want time-intensive cocktails? Get a table and the server can bring that order to the service bar. If your order a mojito, yeah I'll make it, with a smile on my face, but the next time I see you come up I'll be sure to get others out of the way first.\n\nI've been bartending for 10 years now and these are just a few things that come to mind. Every bartender is different. Some don't mind making a 5 step cocktail when they're slammed. I do. Some guys don't care if you ask for a glass for your bottled beer. I do. Drink it out of the fucking bottle unless it needs to be rolled, or you're at a sit down restaurant.\n\nAnd lastly, keep in mind: bartenders are not servers. We don't need to take your shit. We can refuse service for any reason. Of course I always strive to make every guest interaction excellent, but do not snap your fingers, or yell at me, or wave, or \"bro!\" me.

I think most girls can have pretty nice(though maybe not \"perfect\") boobs if they take good care of themselves and stay in shape.\n\n>I doubt that the person running the website would choose which pictures to display based on sexual appeal (either attractive or unattractive). Their mission is to provide a gallery of normal breasts for artists to use as references. Why would they purposefully choose unattractive subjects?\n\nThat's why the OP posted it but that's actually not the purpose of the website at all as far as I can tell. It seems to be a website all about de-sexualizing boobs and making women feel better about their own breasts not being like they're portrayed in the media. Not that it isn't a noble goal or anything but I still feel like it might create slight a selection bias towards less typical breasts both for the people sending them in and the people deciding which ones make the page.\n\nI really don't know though.

I still don't understand why someone running a website promoting normal, non-sexualized breasts would have a bias about which pictures they post so long as they haven't been altered by plastic surgery, photoshop, etc. I could be wrong. All I based my statement on was personal experience. But really who doesn't love boobs? If you're in a situation where you get to see boobs just be grateful.

(See how truing to the side was extremely bad too? There's a pattern here). \n* Building to a handspring is not helpful either. Again, he's throwing his head backwards. Also, a handspring goes backwards. A standing back flip will start and end in the same place, you want to jump exactly straight up (If you go backwards you've wasted power going back that could have been used to go up).\n* His flip itself is bad. He does this weird run into it which will just throw a beginner off, however since he twists during it I expect it's because he has a bad habit of throwing his head back over one shoulder (oh look, bad habits stick). Speaking of, he throws his head back. He also leans back. All of that is bad form and will make the flip more dangerous.\n\nSource: 10 year gymnast, now a coach.", "id": "d5quwuv"}, {"comment": "Any sort of thing in the entire video that involves any turning will start a bad habit.  The rolls he shows include going to the side, as well as his makaku (which you'll never learn from gymnastics because it's ridiculous and doesn't help nearly as much as other skills).  Also I'm probably spelling that wrong.  In any case, a back tuck includes zero turning, and in fact the moment you start to turn you start a horrid habit that is very hard to break.  He's also insinuating that this is a skill you can literally do in five minutes.  That's just straight up not true.  I can't remember if he listed a back handspring as a requirement for the tuck, but it's not.  Doesn't hurt at all to have that beforehand, but it's not necessary at all.  I don't remember the rest, and I figured this would be enough for now.

The makaku (probably spelled wrong) will still start bad habits, as will the idea that a back tuck comes directly from a back handspring.  They are significantly different skills.  The handspring involves much more opening in the shoulders than the tuck does, and the rotation is more about the abs and hips in the tuck.  If you use this way, you will likely begin to twist into your tuck on a very regular basis and will be unable to fix this later.\n\nThis video does give a really good example of the technique though.  The slow-mo just after 12 minutes is exactly what you're going for.  This guy knows what he's doing.\n\nTL:DR: Can you learn it this way?  Yes, absolutely.

If you vent them while asleep you can wear them around 3 days (depending on weather, your shoes and your body) before they get smelly and you want to change them\n\n* usually knee long sock are to too long for that base-pack. Just flip them over at the end to get a second layer of sock. Consider to pack an additional T/trunks...(see above) between the layers by wrapping it around the first sock-layer before flipping over the second layer. (diameter will increase accordingly)\n\n* while neat when packed you will use your cloth eventually. Its totally fine to repack the worn packs once you gathered a whole pack. Mark (or smell) them, even better: put the used pack in a different compartment of your bag. You will avoid mix-up and the spread of odor (they won't get fresher while packed like this)\n\n* you might consider to have one pack packed watertight (like inside of an ordinary plastic bag) so you will always have at least one set of dry cloth\n\nEdit: Format and grammar ", "id": "cz9i7ze"}], [{"comment": "The hole in the right sock is a dealbreaker", "id": "cz92esx"}], [{"comment": "\"do you have any bigger clothes or do you only shop at Baby Gap?\"", "id": "cz9wdt2"}], [{"comment": "Why is this not a 5 second GIF?", "id": "cz8vgbf"}, {"comment": "That won't upload on YouTube ", "id": "cz8w5wy"}]]], "5blqvt": ["Completely useless skill: How to make a pig's tail straight.", "2016-11-07 14:55:49", 2554, "http://imgur.com/gallery/kphXW2W", [[221, "I want to know why this works, and also why the tail re-curls itself eventually."], [138, "Will it work on my pug?"], [68, "r/simpsonsdidit\n\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/_GzQNaaZsh_8/Snrucguw_tI/AAAAAAAAMek/Qj8rPT4Z5t4/s400/17.jpg"], [49, "This kills the pig."], [41, "[Source Video](https://youtu.be/jTXEnE37FyM) "], [34, "I was concerned that the secret was \"a finger in its butt.\""], [28, "How do you re-curl the tail?"], [21, "This is the exact kind of gif i expect to see of in this sub.

We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take a while.

If applied thought is to strike a bell, sustained thought is the tone as the bell rings.)\n- Rapture (a sudden feeling like excitement or alertness)-\n- Happiness (a gladness for the present moment)\n- One-Pointedness (I'm not sure how to describe this without experiencing it firsthand. It's a sense that all else, even yourself, fades away, and the only aspect of your consciousness is the object of focus. If you're focusing on your breath, all that exists is the breath, or a part of the breath. You're no longer a pair of ears listening to the breath, you ARE the sound. But 'you' disappears, so it's just the sound. Sorry, hard to explain.)\n\nAs you go deeper in meditation, each of these aspects will fall away, until it is only one-pointedness. When you've attained a state where only these five factors exist, you'll find the act of applied thought distracting, and it will fall away. Then you're left with four factors, where sustained thought is distracting, so it eventually falls away. Rapture detracts from happiness, and happiness detracts from one-pointedness.\n\nI've only achieved pure one-pointedness twice in my four years of regular meditation (though I admit the first year was wasted because I was using \"basic\" techniques like the OP image of this post), and after the first time, I knew this was one of the most important things I could be practicing in my life. Knowing that I have that level of peace inside me and I carry it everywhere is really transformative. \n\nDon't get me wrong, though: this is not what meditation is like every time. This is the best outcome of meditation. Forcing this to happen is counterproductive. Really, the act of meditation is focusing on the breath, not starting new thoughts, and allowing yourself to feel glad. Repetition, patience, and time will open deeper paths. \n\nP.S. I'll add that it takes me at least ten minutes of sitting before I stop having so many normal thoughts and can begin to truly focus. Generally I don't feel 'deep' until after at least twenty minutes.

I've heard that, with regular daily sessions, it can help reduce stress and generally make you feel better mentally.\n\nBy the way, when you're actually meditating, your mind will wander and you'll have stray thoughts. Don't worry, don't think about how you need to stop thinking, just imagine you're a mountain and the thoughts are clouds. They drift up to you, and they just drift away on their own.

It takes a while to click for people and when it does you just get it, a lot like riding a bike or understanding what a clich\u00e9 is.\n\nHere's your ten-step to meditation:\n\n1. Get comfy. \n2. Close your eyes. \n3. Pay attention to something - your heartbeat or your breathing or the sound of cars, or even how uncomfortable you are because finding a genuinely comfortable position is really hard. \n4. Get distracted. You will get distracted almost immediately by a thought or series of thoughts. Suddenly you'll realise you haven't been focusing on The Thing for about thirty seconds. \n5. Focus on the thing again. \n6. Get distracted again immediately. \n7. Focus on the thing again. \n8. Get distracted again, and start getting angry because you don't get it and you can't do this and you're such a fuck up. \n9. Focus on the thing again. \n\nStep ten is a click. It might happen during your first session or it might take a while, but eventually you'll have the realisation that (spoiler) [You aren't your thoughts. There is a part of your mind whose purpose is to constantly Think and worry and get overexcited and remember that embarrassing thing we did once, and we identify with that part of us. But that isn't who we are. It's never going to stop, but it isn't who we are. And once you realise that, everything, *everything*, becomes so much easier](/spoiler). \n\nIf you're like me, you'll think you understand step ten without needing to meditate. If you're like me, you won't actually understand step ten without meditating. \n\nWhen step ten clicks, you realise steps one to nine were kind of bullshit, but helpful bullshit to trick you out of your comfort zone. You don't need to close your eyes, you don't need to be comfortable, you don't need to be sitting still. You can be jerking off or doing your taxes while meditating. It's just about focusing, getting distracted and focusing again. \n\nI truly believe that anybody who says there is more to meditation than this is scamming you or being scammed. I really like OP's post because that's what meditation feels like to me, but it probably isn't a good introduction for people who don't understand what meditation *is* yet.

Basically laser has toner that fuses into the paper (but has a residual layer of ink that will transfer) and inkjet prints will lay ink in dots on top of the paper (if the paper is nicely coated) or soak into the paper if it's thinner. That being said, every printer is a little different and they all have their quirks depending on a combination of image, ink type, paper type, and printer model/quality.\n\nEdit: I did a bookbinding final using transfers. Most people wouldn't go so far as to compare models of printer or quality of transfer between various paper but basically use any laser printed image and you're good to go.

I knew where this was going.\n\nAfter about a few seconds of conversation, some twit bet a chippy that nobody could say the alphabet backwards in less than like 20 seconds.\n\nBoth Josephina and I decided to take one for the team and \"try\" to say it ...The bastards didn't know what hit them.\n\nWe were able to say it, both completely in unison (we had practiced together A LOT)... and in about 5 seconds flat.\n\nShocked the lot of them.

You know the drill. \n\nStrangely, the cop also asked that the very obviously drunk guy **said the alphabet backwards.** \n\nNeedless to say, the poor sod didn't have a chance. Guy was arrested for DUI and that episode ended.\n\nJosephina and I were a little bit annoyed with the cop. We didn't think anybody could say the alphabet backwards drunk *or* sober... yet something sparked.\n\nWe took it upon ourselves to learn how to do it ourselves, in the (somewhat unlikely) case that it was ever brought up again.\n\nWe didn't think it ever would. *Until one day*, about four or five orrrr maybe more years ago.\n\nWe were both hanging out with some friends when the backwards alphabet somehow came up into discussion... \n\nWe both probably exchanged glances with each other but I remember feeling really fucking smirky. I knew where this was going.\n\nAfter about a few seconds of conversation, some twit bet a chippy that nobody could say the alphabet backwards in less than like 20 seconds.\n\nBoth Josephina and I decided to take one for the team and \"try\" to say it ...The bastards didn't know what hit them.\n\nWe were able to say it, both completely in unison (we had practiced together A LOT)... and in about 5 seconds flat.\n\nShocked the lot of them.
