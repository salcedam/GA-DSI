They make google faster by integrating with it, they make page loading faster, by deciding when best to go about blanking the screen, display loading imagery, etc. in FFX you just get a loading bar, which then stops always at the 20% mark, for a good second or so (give or take, depending on location)\n\nit doesn't try to lie to the user, which in turn makes it feel sluggish.

Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.", "id": "d93v0sl"}, {"comment": "Oh.", "id": "d93wyfw"}, {"comment": ".", "id": "d943s4r"}], [{"comment": "King fishers tend to not give a fuck.", "id": "d939ba8"}, {"comment": "They also tend to be illiterate.", "id": "d93etik"}, {"comment": "In terms of languages developed by humans.

The Lake Forest High School parking lot was like an expensive car showroom, the girls at the school were all ridiculously pretty and people generally seemed pleasant enough though I was shocked that although it was much milder than in the movies, the whole jocks and nerds type clique situation was very real.  Also when I was there in the late 90s there were maybe 2-3 black kids in the whole high school. \n\nI stayed with 3 different families over the course of a year. The first was a humourless family of cliche business-people types, second were old hippies and third were young architects. I liked the second family most, the others were nice but just so weird and fake in the strangest ways. The architects were cool-strange though and I didn't mind their quirkiness so much but the first family were just alien to me. \n\nThey were the least affluent of the three and the whole family seemed very focused on \"making it\". They had tightly followed rules about almost everything (I was scolded for not cutting a hamburger in half once). I felt bad for their constant self-imposed stress more than anything though. They were a typical middle class suburban family but they all lived as though all that mattered was having a bigger car and a better house, which doesn't sound horrendous but when the  realisation hits you that their every decision is indexed to this goal, their every action starts becoming painfully transparent and you can't help but be put off by the blatant self-serving nature of anything they decide to do, even taking in an exchange student. I felt like a way for the dad to gain acceptance at the club which organised the student exchange program. They invited me into their home which was wonderful of them but then I became invisible to them. It was definitely an educational experience and they've obviously left deep impressions in my memory of my year there.\n\nThat year I also fingerbanged a chick on my first mountain climbing trip, drunkenly puked all over my open luggage during my first skiing trip and also got wasted and smashed vodka bottles on this rich girl's private golf course,  walked over hot coals on a bet and ended up puking up half inside and half outside some poor bastard's car. Suffice to say I could not hold my drink when I was 17. Oh I also made 1 snowshoe. That was an awesome year. Shit! I even got to see 3 Bulls games! \n\nI wonder if the \"THE BOSS HATES HIPPIES\" grafitti over the Peanuts mural is still there. Ah memories.\n\n", "id": "d58dgjw"}, {"comment": "Cool.

One common theme is a universal basic income, where everybody is given a living wage automatically, without working, and people who choose to work can make more and afford more luxuries.\n\nThe problem is, our society (as shown by your post) and economy (as shown by the huge fear of unemployment) can't handle this well, just yet, so it's going to be a bumpy transition.

Secondary source is Erowid. \n\nCan I snort crushed alprazolam tablets?\nNasal insufflation (often called \"snorting\") sometimes occurs, but due to the drug's chemical structure and excipients in the ground tablets it is possible that these could act as a buffer, preventing the active ingredient from being absorbed through the mucous membranes. Instead, the powdered tablets and mucous drip down the back of the throat into the stomach, where they are absorbed as they would have been if taken orally. Therefore, insufflation of crushed alprazolam tablets is no more potent than when taken orally. This method of administration can be very unpredictable because it often requires a higher dose to produce an effect and side-effects such as memory loss, loss of motor-function and slurred speech are more likely to become present. Furthermore, nasal insufflation may be significantly less potent than other means of administrations, because the mucous drip enters the stomach at a slower rate than traditional ingestion. Because of fillers, snorting crushed alprazolam tablets causes moderate nasal inflammation. For a list of excipients in alprazolam tablets, see INACTIVE INGREDIENTS. Note: The composition and amount of excipients in generics may be different from those in the brand name product. Panistat, an intranasal formulation of alprazolam is safely and effectively absorbed through the nasal passages and acts more quickly.", "id": "d61zqyj"}, {"comment": "you could shove it up your arse as long as it hits the blood stream it will get you high.

The Crosswalk Slam and Wrong Way Wreck are easily avoided by not riding on sidewalks and not riding the wrong way (common sense stuff for most of us).\n\nRelated to the Door Prize is when pedestrians try to enter their car which is parked alongside a bike lane. They have to walk in the bike lane to get to the driver side door, and they often do so without looking to see if any bikes are coming. They seem to treat the bike lane as if it was a sidewalk. I've nearly hit several pedestrians in this situation, but so far have avoided it.\n\nIt doesn't mention another scenario where I've actually been hit by a car, and taking the lane would likely have prevented it. I was traveling in the bike lane, which is sandwiched between a traffic lane and a lane full of parked cars. I approached an intersection where a car on my right was waiting to turn left across my path. Driver didn't see me and pulled out in front of me. Had I been riding in the lane, he likely would have seen me, but because the bike lane was so close to a lane of parked cars, those parked cars blocked his view. I didn't have enough time to avoid the collision and slammed into his front fender and rolled over his hood. Driver was really apologetic about it, even drove me to the bike shop and paid for repairs (saddle and wheels). I had some pretty nasty bruises and road rash, but  didn't require medical attention.", "id": "dajixin"}, {"comment": "The door prize is poor design, as was your crash - bike lanes shouldn't share space with parking lanes.\n\nOn my motorbike, I understand SMIDSY. I also understand I am invisible, and ride accordingly. Last, I understand that drivers don't always understand the physics of my vehicle, and that makes me unpredictable to them.\n\nIn Adelaide, one of the CBD streets gave up an entire lane each way for bikes as a trial. Cyclists don't use that one either, but to be fair there is car parking to the sides. You have explained that one for me.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why on my commute along a 2-lane each way highway, with a pretty wide bike lane, many cyclists prefer to share my 100 km/hr lane rather than use the bike lane.\n", "id": "dajm2oo"}, {"comment": "I'd have to see it to explain why (if there is an explanation).

What?\n\nFrom tech point of view: very hard to track Tor, Skype, Gmail, etc, etc. After the leaks, everyone assumed that the ONLY safe place was Tor...except Tor is and was funded by the government. Much easier to track your enemies if they now only use one place isn't it?\n\nHis \"leaks\" look NOTHING like other known, confirmed leaks (example, Manning leaks). Snowdens were a bunch of pretty Powerpoints. Classified data is always just a bunch of jargon and acronymns. The stuff he listed does not look like classified data.\n\nDuring his interview, he was using CIA talking points (read about that)\n\nSo far, nothing changed, except the data collection has been openly legalized.\n\n**Since leaks are inevitable, it is better to \"create\" your own, so it leaks how you want it to.**\n\nSnowden is now in the inner circle of computer privacy-a place the CIA could never hope to hack. He is now a guest speaker!\n\nBeing in Russia doesn't guarantee him safety. If we wanted him, we would have him.\n\nFurthermore...how did his girlfriend get to Russia and live with him now? That makes no sense. You know she was under surveillance. You can't just \"go\" to another country like Russia. She would have had to send in her passport, get a visa from the Russian consulate, then what? Buy tickets on Orbitz and just walk into the airport, get on a plane, and fly to Russia-and the US would actually let that happen? Bullshit. Look how much effort went into hacking the work phone of the San Bernadino shooter. You think the US government just decided to do aboslutly nothing about Snowden's girlfriend? She can't enter Russia without permission anyways, why couldn't we just follow her to Snowden? Why is she freely attending award shows? Makes no sense.\n\nAd that to the fact that Snowden effictively does not exist on paper...nobody knew him, no neighbors, no friends, no stories from High School, no verifiable past employers...the guy is a ghost. A white, 35 year old IT guy ghost that now happened to fit the perfect demographic to stage a leak and infiltrate all the hacking communities the NSA/CIA previously could not.\n\nEven more simpler: compare Assange, Manning, versus Snowden. One is in prison for life, one lives on the couch in an Ecuadorian embassy...and the other one lives a charmed life in Russia with his girlfriend? Which one of those doesn't add up?\n\nI think it was the Stassi that said \"what good is a massive surveillance program, if no one knows you have it?\"", "id": "d1ps0be"}, {"comment": "You didnt forget to wear your aluminim foil hat today, did you?", "id": "d1q049n"}, {"comment": ">No names political names were leaked\n\nOne document was signed by Eric Holder, and just the very leaking of many of the documents implies that James Clapper was lying to congress only months earlier. Plus, there was a document stating that the G20 summit meetings were being monitored, and attendees were being personally surveilled. Also, Snowden outright dumped everything into Greenwald's hands with lots of personal identification that Greenwald decided not to publish to safeguard the people involved, especially because \"Manning endangered the lives of our operatives\" was a familiar cry of the cables and afghan/iraqi leaks.\n\n> No American corporation names were leaked\n\nHe worked originally for Dell before Booz Allen as a contractor. One of the very first leaks before he disclosed his identity was about Verizon. Also, the Prism leaks implicated Skype, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, and Dropbox. Memory's a little fuzzy but I'm pretty sure their logos were actually in the PPTs.\n\n> After the leaks, everyone assumed that the ONLY safe place was Tor...except Tor is and was funded by the government.\n\nTOR is based on Military technology, but I've seen no evidence that it's currently funded by the military. It however isn't as airtight as the three letter agencies pretend it is, so I'll partially give you that.\n\n>His \"leaks\" look NOTHING like other known, confirmed leaks (example, Manning leaks). Snowdens were a bunch of pretty Powerpoints. Classified data is always just a bunch of jargon and acronymns. The stuff he listed does not look like classified data.\n\nFirst off, not all the leaks were powerpoint. Many were \"traditional\" classified memos.   \nSecondly, umm... the military LOVES powerpoint. [Fucking loves it](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/world/27powerpoint.html).     \nSo much training and briefing is done by staring at powerpoint slides. [There are powerpoints making fun of how much the military relies on powerpoint](http://imgur.com/58Jjc9D).    \nBring up powerpoint to a vet, especially a former deskjockey, and you'll probably be greated by a thousand yard stare along with a stern suggestion to never ever talk of the matter with him again.    \nThe Manning leak was of correspondence logs. The Snowden leak had a lot of briefing docs. This is like asking two people to describe a meal and calling the second one a liar because he described dinner while the first one described breakfast.     \nTop Secret briefings call for Top Secret PowerPoints.\n\n> Ad that to the fact that Snowden effictively does not exist on paper\n\nOk... so... um... well... fuck, I can't even...    \nThis makes birther claims seem logical by comparison. \nThere's records up the wazoo, from getting his GED, enrolling in Community College, and enrolling in several educational programs, and I've not heard any legitimate sourced (ie: not from the ATS or GLP forums) reports of neighbors claiming they've never seen him.     \nHe was a quiet kid. I can't even imagine what level of \"visibility\" you'd require as proof. He had a YouTube channel, and an ArsTechnica account from 2001.    \nI don't even understand why creating a fake identity would even matter, for that matter. For Obama, yeah, an evil Islamic Nigerian would naturally have to fake being a natural born citizen, but for Snowden? Okay, let's say this guy's actually a lifelong CIA agent named Bob FireCabin. Why the fuck would you need to even fake a new identity?\n\n>Buy tickets on Orbitz and just walk into the airport, get on a plane, and fly to Russia-and the US would actually let that happen?\n\nNo, she could've used TripAdvisor. Is she being surveiled? Definitely. But they can't charge her with anything because she didn't do anything. If they started hard restricting her travel, that would worsen their image issues. Remember, the NSA wants us to believe that we have nothing to fear from their surveillance if we've done nothing wrong, and taking action would run counter to that. That's not to say that they might not have considered if it was possible to punish family members with any dirty info using \"parallel construction.\"    \nI wouldn't be surprised if she get's the quad s on her boarding pass, though. It's almost like an activist badge of honor nowadays, really.\n\n> Being in Russia doesn't guarantee him safety. If we wanted him, we would have him.\n\nEven if we could, there would be a backlash. It's pretty much accepted that Beijing let Snowden leave using the excuse of a technicality: the old, \"you didn't file the papers exactly.\" We're essentially frenemies with China, to be succinct.   \nOur relations with Russia are... strained. First off, extraditing him safely isn't as easy as you think it is, and \"dealing with\" him could most likely result in Russia retaliating, and backlash domestically.    \nYou make it sound like we can just push a button on a super secret DARPA teleporter to beam the guy into a prison cell, or have a spy whack him, then quickly walk away whistling, and the only response from Putin would be to yell \"\u0421\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c!\"\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI've always considered myself a sort of conspiracy theory connoisseur. I try to follow the evidence, but entertain the possibility of alternative explanations, some off the wall, some less so.

They were serving dangerously hot coffee, and doing so knowingly.\n\nA quote from the Internet:\n\n> McFact No. 1: For years, McDonald's had known they had a problem with the way they make their coffee - that their coffee was served much hotter (at least 20 degrees more so) than at other restaurants.\n> \n> McFact No. 2: McDonald's knew its coffee sometimes caused serious injuries - more than 700 incidents of scalding coffee burns in the past decade have been settled by the Corporation - and yet they never so much as consulted a burn expert regarding the issue.\n> \n> McFact No. 3: The woman involved in this infamous case suffered very serious injuries - third degree burns on her groin, thighs and buttocks that required skin grafts and a seven-day hospital stay. \n> \n> McFact No. 4: The woman, an 81-year old former department store clerk who had never before filed suit against anyone, said she wouldn't have brought the lawsuit against McDonald's had the Corporation not dismissed her request for compensation for medical bills.\n> \n> McFact No. 5: A McDonald's quality assurance manager testified in the case that the Corporation was aware of the risk of serving dangerously hot coffee and had no plans to either turn down the heat or to post warning about the possibility of severe burns, even though most customers wouldn't think it was possible.\n> \n> McFact No. 6: After careful deliberation, the jury found McDonald's was liable because the facts were overwhelmingly against the company. When it came to the punitive damages, the jury found that McDonald's had engaged in willful, reckless, malicious, or wanton conduct, and rendered a punitive damage award of 2.7 million dollars. (The equivalent of just two days of coffee sales, McDonalds Corporation generates revenues in excess of 1.3 million dollars daily from the sale of its coffee, selling 1 billion cups each year.)\n> \n> McFact No. 7: On appeal, a judge lowered the award to $480,000, a fact not widely publicized in the media. \n> \n> McFact No. 8: A report in Liability Week, September 29, 1997, indicated that Kathleen Gilliam, 73, suffered first degree burns when a cup of coffee spilled onto her lap. Reports also indicate that McDonald's consistently keeps its coffee at 185 degrees, still approximately 20 degrees hotter than at other restaurants.

And it was never about causing burns in general- it was the fact that the temperature required by McDonald's would cause third degree burns in 2-7 seconds. \n\nThey actually recommended 160 degrees, since that wouldn't cause serious burns for about 20 seconds, which gives a little more time to react. \n\nDuring discovery, they found that McDonald's was aware of 700 other serious injuries due to the coffee alone, and had already settled out of court for many claims. They were very aware that the temperature was causing serious injury, giving rise to claims of negligence.\n\nInterestingly, Liebeck was initially only asking for medical costs. She needed skin grafts and other procedures, and asked only that McDonald's pay for those. When they refused, she went to court again only asking for medical costs (possibly plus pain and suffering at that point, I don't recall).

Whether or not other companies do the same thing has no real bearing on this specific case, no more than if someone hurts themselves at your house but your neighbor's home isn't any safer.

I completely accept that it's entirely natural and that we shouldn't shame women for breastfeeding, and in fact we should encourage it for health reasons, but why the hell do you need to do it in public, or if you do, why do you feel offended if someone asks you to please cover up?", "id": "d3tmi5r"}, {"comment": "I'll bite. This is going to be quick and probably flit around from idea to idea.\r\n\r\nIt's totally plausible that someone is offended, but the question is \"Is it reasonable for someone to be offended such that the other one must refrain from acting?\". That is, what is it about the act that makes it impermissible to do it in public?\r\n\r\nThe act of breastfeeding is just eating from a breast. Clearly, eating isn't impermissible, so it must be the breast that is the focus (or the relationship between eating and the breast). I can think of two reasons why someone wouldn't want to watch breast feeding: (1) the breast is a sexual object and thus must be concealed, and (2) the breast is a sexual object and ought not be involved with non-sexual acts. Other excuses would be either reducible to those, or are probably incoherent (although I may be wrong on either account). \r\n\r\nThe important aspect of both those claims is \"the breast is a sexual object\" without that proposition, the reasons don't make a lot of sense. In regards to number 1, I'm not sure if that's a strong reason. Faces can also be considered sexual objects, as is hair, and some cultures do request the concealing of those objects, but it's clearly an arbitrary distinction. It's perfectly plausible to view nipples and breasts generally much in the same method of a male's chest; something that may have sexual tones, but can be publicly exposed. It's not inherently sexual as the sexual associations are imputed and not innately sexual (although they are associated with sex qua reproductive role, they aren't necessarily associated with sex qua act of reproduction). As such, we're always going to be able to ask \"why draw the line here?\", and I suspect that no answer will be provided that doesn't just assume some cultural norm. It's perfectly acceptable for that person who has the cultural norm to act that way, but it may be challenging to show why someone from some other culture (or who is a member of a different sub-culture) to act in such a way. In regards to 2, that doesn't explain why someone who isn't identifying the breast sexually (or at least not in this instance) ought to behave differently. It's the viewer's application of the sexual meaning and upset-ness, not the breast feeder.\r\n\r\nTo really drive this point home consider the following. Say your boss decides that they like your work, but they don't like how your face looks. They require you to conceal your face and you can show it in private, but not publicly. Such a situation and request seems insulting let alone not something one should follow. But how is that situation different from breastfeeding? If you assume that the mother isn't participating in the sexualization of breasts, then how do those concerns matter to her?\r\n\r\nIn sum, the most likely reason to want someone to conceal breastfeeding is due to an arbitrary norm (although which may be culturally acquired). If someone is breastfeeding in public it isn't clear that she ought to abide by that culture's norms as she may not be a member of that culture.

With that in mind what else is there? Just look how the cast payment breaks down for ensemble female only productions, for instance in Ghostbusters 3 Melissa McCarthy earned 14 million (plus extra on the side for a production credit), while her co-star Leslie Jones made approximately 200k. Without a doubt, I feel like Jones was actually funnier and better in that movie than McCarthy, but McCarthy is the one that puts asses in the seats, so she gets the money.

Women are traditionally expected to take leadership roles in raising a family and take time off to be a mother. While one can say that men can take paternity leave too, the social default is for women to play the role of caretaker. Also, men don't get pregnant or breast-feed so they don't have that in the way of their careers--starting a family and advancing in their field is not as big of a trade-off for them as it is for women.\n\nAlso, there is the fact that from a young age society is more welcoming of boys than girls into more lucrative stem fields. Boys tend to be given/are marketed blocks and legos while girls tend to be given dolls and arts and crafts.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that girls are underrepresented in STEM in schools creates a self-perpetuating social barrier for more girls to participate. People, especially in middle and high school, are very conscious about the groups they associate with and tend to seek out those similar to themselves. It becomes more uncomfortable for a girl to take a class that is male-dominated as it is harder for her to identify with the others taking the class. \n\n> Interestingly, research from the Girls\u2019 Schools Association (which represents girls' only schools) shows that girls are 75 per cent more likely to take maths and two and a half times as likely to take physics than at mixed schools. President of the GSA, Hilary French, attributes this to the fact that \u201cin a girls\u2019 school, the pressure to opt for the subjects which are perceived as more \u2018feminine\u2019 just doesn\u2019t exist and so the potentially talented female scientists and mathematicians are able to pursue their interests and achieve their full potential.\u201d \n\n-[Telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10506087/Girls-maths-physics-A-levels-The-real-reason-why-girls-dont-do-maths-A-level.html)\n\nWhile the pay gap 75 cent figure is misleading in that it implies gender inequities originate at the paycheck level, it does highlight a social system that through ingrained structures tends to place men in more powerful and lucrative positions than women, even though evidence suggests that women possess equal natural talent. It would likely be better for society as a whole if this inequitable system was resolved, and individuals were elevated into positions of power based on measures of natural ability and affinity more accurate than gender.\n", "id": "dalnybf"}, {"comment": "> It would likely be better for society as a whole if this inequitable system was resolved.\n\nThat's an unsupported claim.

It doesn't exactly add to the discussion if you deny any validity to one of the most influential ethical systems that exist in a four word sentence.\n\nIf you really want to say that there is an intrinsic value to those sights and that they need to be categorically protected under all circumstances then it is you who needs to explain it in a very valid, reasonable and coherently structured argument yourself.\n\nIf you do want to take the utilitarian approach though, then we need to ask ourselves what actual value do these sights bring. There are probably a lot of people who simply enjoy seeing them. They may also encourage tourism and help to give Belgium a better image internationally.\n\nThose last two points I would argue are probably small in effect though. The first one only works if you think that viewing something in person is a lot better than seeing it on photos, models or soon in Virtual Reality (which will ultimately make it utterly worthless to preserve these things). But alright, for now there might be some people who enjoy it more in person, but I doubt the difference is significant enough for most to make a big impact.\n\nOn the other side you have of course the citizens and people who live in the vicinity who are limited in their personal freedom and quality of life.\n\nI don't see how it is even a contest.\n", "id": "d0i91du"}, {"comment": "Or these limitations do work in maintaining personal freedom and quality of life. \n\nI don't know the specifics of this place in Belgium, but preservation is most of the time done not for the vanity of keeping shit pretty, but to maintain a set standard of living for the community that could be threatened to worsen were further development to be made.

But what I find interesting in this analogy is the fact that you can describe something in a way that makes sense and is meaningful but still not be telling the truth. In fact science isn't really about understanding how the universe works, but more about creating tools and logical paths to describe what we observe. That's why science works with theories and not truths. We don't know if what we describe is really a pure truth, and we will never know.\n\nAnd I like to think that there are infinite types of sciences and points of views to explain the universe.
