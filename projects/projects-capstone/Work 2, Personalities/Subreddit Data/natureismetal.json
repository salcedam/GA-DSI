[Here's a simplified phylogeny](http://i.imgur.com/p387IBb.png) (evolutionary family tree) from one of my dino lectures.  It looks like the archosaur common ancestor had some kind of integumentary structure that developmentally turned off in crocodylians (though they still possess the requisite genes).  These integumentary structures became [pycnofibers in the pterosaur lineage](http://www.1000pa.com/forum/photos/images/637Jeholopterus588.jpg) and were ancestrally present in dinosaurs.  They were lost in many later ornithischian lineages (*Stegosaurus*, *Ankylosaurus*, *Iguanodon* and so forth), though they became quill-like defensive structures in some marginocephalian lineages (like [*Psittacosaurus*](https://archosaurmusings.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_7811.jpg) and maybe many larger ceratopsians like *Triceratops*).  The integumentary structures were lost in sauropods, but were likely exapted as sensory vibrissae like a cat's whiskers in early theropod dinosaurs.  Then these sensory structures were used for sexual display and/or insulation, becoming \"proto-feathers\" until they were exapted for wing-assisted incline running (WAIR), which is how young dinosaurs (i.e. all young birds) run up trees for protection from predators before they can fly.  After there was a fitness advantage for WAIR, modern bird-like dinosaurs evolved very quickly.  And [this behavior of running up trees before being able to fly](https://j.gifs.com/v2vNlm.gif) is seen in almost every extant bird lineage today, even the birds that cannot fly as adults!

I haven't found any high-res photos of the area where the bristles stop, however, and I think it's possible that the bristles/quills extend farther in the anterior direction like a horse's mane.

(In particular, the Ornithischia did posess them, see for example [Kulindadromeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulindadromeus).)\n\nBeyond that, there is still the possibility (with at the moment probably minority support ?, but rising), that the feature was basal to all dinosaurs and actually somewhat older; again very much dependent on what you count as feathers. It is very likely, almost certain, that the pycnofibers (somewhat hair/featherquill like filaments) of Pterosaurs are homologues to feathers (but not mammalian hairs).

Also catfishes needs many practise until this method works, there is few conditions to that : the pidgeon need to be close of a group of pidgeons so it will be less defensive and less feared by environment, it needs to be a bit immersed (so the catfish can come close to him) and it needs to be back to the river...\n\nAlso they told that those who succeeded to learn this hunting method can have a diet consisting of up to 80% of pidgeons which become their easiest way to eat protein... And only the \"middle-sized\" catfishes have been seen hunting this way, they assume that bigger catfishes would take too much risk of grounding (and dying outside of the water) by hunting pidgeons and/or that they would not eat enough proteins by hunting pidgeons...", "id": "d8w6hur"}, {"comment": "a big catfish wouldnt have troubles with eating a small dog either", "id": "d8wc5ki"}, {"comment": "or a small man...

I looked up to see an owl with roughly a four foot wingspan landing in a tree about 8 feet above me. I froze staring into the silhouette looking back at me. It eventually flew off silently.

You see a few attempts at the latter towards the beginning of the video.\n\nThe wolves, knowing that a 'stand your ground' herd mentality won't do the hunt much good at all, force a panic. Once flipped from the fight to flight mode, all bets are off and every individual is out to save it's own skin.\n\nIt's easy to look on as an outsider and attempt to rationalise an animal's behaviour; the truth however is that animals like these really don't operate and make decisions like we do (heck, in the heat of the moment, when your own life is in danger, few humans do). Their predator avoidance response is most effective when kept simple: flee. Any behaviour which promoted any sort of altruism in this context would be quickly selected out; there's a far higher statistical risk of an attack failing than not, and so the altruistic genes will be swept out the pool. Unless it's your own kin, and therefore genes on the line, most herd animals couldn't give a shit about one another under these sort of circumstances; just keep your head down, hope they get someone else and run to 'dem hills!", "id": "d7t802k"}, {"comment": "We do however know what the bison's head goes through...", "id": "d7t8r3w"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the clear explanation.

The hind legs can also be used to kill or maim with devastating effect. At the time bison ran wild, they were rated second only to the Alaska brown bear as a potential killer, more dangerous than the grizzly bear. In the words of early naturalists, they were dangerous, savage animals that feared no other animal and in prime condition could best any foe[29] (except for wolves and brown bears[3][30]).\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison\n\n>Plains bison are often in the smaller range of sizes, and wood bison in the larger range.

I'm not sure how having friends who work at Disney yields some kind of inside information. That just sounds dumb.  The staff at gf wasn't feeding gators that's definitely wrong.

In essence what is happening is that the animals mind shuts out what it is about to, or is, experiencing.

It is hypothesized that we humans may do the same thing during a period of trauma, but that the true memory of the event is stored in the subconscious as an echo of the distress.  Through therapy (or Somatic experiencing) it can be uncovered, understood, and refiled in the conscious mind so as to remove the echo of trauma and discomfort.

Throat clamping is also often suffocation of an animal by clamping down on its trachea AND the major pumping vessels of the neck, which generally works better for more medium-sized prey (zebra, wildebeest) or those with less beefy necks.  Bite and retreat is more a Komodo dragon thing, but it can also apply to slower predators and less-well matched prey (think hyenas working together to attack a buffalo).  \n\nRegardless of how this guy's lower jaw became defleshed, he can't be effectively muzzle clamped now and seems too weak to do anything.

They sun themselves and then enter small streams to hunt fish, tadpoles, even crayfish.  While doing field work I noticed that a fair percentage had healed over crushing injuries, including ribs sticking out of healed skin, that looked like the type of injuries that would be inflicted by bird talons.  Anyway, I captured some specimens to do captive feeding experiments.  I released snakes and fish into a semi aquatic enclosure and watched them hunt.  Here's the weird thing.  Every time, and I mean every time for more than 100 feedings, the snake *(Thamnophis elegans vagrans)* would insist on eating the fish tail first.  If one of the six snakes I had made a mistake, and started eating the fish head first, it would regurgitate the fish from its throat, turn it around, and finish eating the fish tail first.  Even the obviously streamlined trout that were part of the study were eaten tail first.  I didn't have the equipment or time to find out why, but this had never been documented in other aquatic/semiaquatic snakes at the time.  On top of that, one of the prey items that are present in their range are sculpins.  These fish can throw back their heads and lock open their gill covers (operculum), and even in death these operculum stay locked open with spiny knobs on them - making them extremely difficult for predators of a certain size to consume.  My snakes still insisted on eating these fish tail first, which was like watching them trying to eat open umbrellas, and sometimes it would take them an hour and a half, once more than two hours, to work their unhinged jaws around this type of prey.  The snakes grab prey underwater, then surface and head for bed rock where they can immediately warm up and begin to manipulate and swallow their prey in a place where it can't get away.  *Those sculpins, even though they are dead, manage to expose the snakes that killed them to an increased chance of being killed and eaten themselves by hawks and other avian predators.*  Nonscientific conclusion, natureismetal, and evolution is a bitch.", "id": "d9f1pbo"}, {"comment": "Bro, you're blowing my mind and making science sound badass", "id": "d9g814y"}], [{"comment": "Why not just evolve claws, god dammit?", "id": "d9eaa06"}], [{"comment": "Logan sends his regards.

However, if they are chilling near the shoreline and you are not that far, they sure as hell will *not* leave you alone if they are hungry lol.  They kill a lot of people crossing the river from Zimbabwe to get into South Africa illegally.

A single python typically eats two times its weight in food in a year. So a 20lb python is only eating 40lbs of food in an entire year.

These are generated by neurons (cells in your brain), which in a resting state have lots of sodium on the outside and lots of potassium on the inside. \nEssentially when a neuron needs to transmit a signal it does so by opening special \"gates\" in its membrane that allow sodium ions to flow into the cell. This alters the electrochemical gradient of the cells, which causes sodium gates to open further down along the axon of the neuron (think a long arm that connects it to other neurons among other things). \nNow once this has been completed (the signal has been propagated) in this section of the axon, it needs to return to a resting membrane potential, or get its electrochemical gradient back to where it was in order to do it again. It does this by opening special potassium gates that allow potassium to flow out of the cell, which re-establishes the correct charges in and out of the cell such that it can send another signal.\n\nNo, bananas are not the only natural source of potassium available to humans (squash, avocados, beans)\n\nPotassium deficiency isn't good.

She had just left to go to the store and the guy I'd just gone out on a first date with a few nights before was headed to my house to pick me up. My grandmas car pulled back in after about ten minutes and she looked concerned. She told me she couldn't feel her legs. \n\nThis was only a few days after my aunt had died from cancer, and my grandfather back in January. Grandmother was just getting back to herself after the loss and I, her only grandchild, was taking care of her and my mother, who is a terrible cunt that acts like a child. \n\nAnyway, I get her to her bed and call the doctor, who says to go to the emergency room asap. She's not happy about this and doesn't want to. I call my uncle and get my mom out of bed, to let them know what's going on. Grandma explains it like having your legs fall asleep numb, but they just won't get any better. She was terrified she was going to crash. \n\nMy date arrives in torn jeans and a six inch Mohawk and I explain the situation. My uncle--a massive man that doesn't fit through doorways height or width -wise--is out of state on a run. I'm afraid just me taking her down the steps to the car she'll fall and my mother is far too spherical to assist. \n\nSo my date and I carry her out and to the car. She compliments his hair. We spend the rest of the day in the hospital with her. Her sister stops by and starts talking to him about his hair and how much she just loves that look. Did I mention my great aunt is ninety?

It shouldn't get infected and the swimming in salt water will help it heal and keep clean. I've seen an Australian fur seal with a massive shark bite taken out of it slowly heal over a number of years. This penguin's biggest issue is the damage to the feathers. \n\nPenguins have a gland just above their tail that they squeeze a wax out of and rub into their feathers. This means they are waterproof on the outer layer, and the inner layer is soft and fluffy and full of air. Normally when a penguin goes swimming the water never gets through to their skin and they go around like one big bubble. They float on top of the surface just like a basketball, and like a basketball when you shove one underwater the air will help it pop back up to the surface. This is how they hunt. They use this rush back to the surface to give them a speed boost and they come up underneath their prey. \n\nOnce you 'pop' this bubble they have a very hard time hunting. This is why oil is so damaging to seabirds. It clumps the feathers together and breaks the waterproof barrier. They dive and the air is squeezed out and replaced with water. No more shooting back to the surface. A patch of oil the size of a 10 cent coin (let's say a little smaller than a quarter for the Americans) can kill the penguins I work with (little penguins, *eudyptula minor*). This penguin is much bigger, and would probably survive a relatively bigger hole, but this gash across the chest would definitely classify.\n\nSo it's not going to be able to hunt effectively for a long time. In this picture it's summer, so it's going to be ok for a little while. It can live off blubber and maybe even rub some wax into the feathers that are there and help seal off the air bubble some. The big issue is surviving the coming winter. If it's already living off fat reserves then it will need to lay down even more fat to get through winter, and remember it can't hunt very well.\n\nThe other issue is thermoregulation. The feathers not only keep it dry but also warm. It will be dumping body heat out through this wound. You may have seen little penguins waddling around in jumpers. When we have an oil spill we put the jumpers on them for two reasons. One to stop them ingesting the oil, and two to help them thermoregulate.\n\nSo it comes down to a few things: \n- how fast it heals\n- how waterlogged the feathers get via this wound\n- how successful it is at hunting\n\nI would say the bird would have at least a few weeks left, and there is a very low but possible chance of it surviving.", "id": "d46m7e6"}, {"comment": "Little blues!

Trap closes, with insect inside the outer limits of the flytrap \n\n3. Insect struggles to free itself, continuing to stimulate the hairs, triggering the pod's sealing process. \n     A. If the insect is too large, making the pod unable to seal, the pod will open up, and the bug will be released. \n\n     B. If the insect is dead, and doesn't struggle inside the pod, the pod will not seal. This is why you can't feed a flytrap raw meat or dead bugs. \n\n     C. If a leg or other body part is hanging out of the pod, and that protrusion prevents the pod from sealing, the pod will open back up. \n\n4. The pod seals itself, [folding the \"teeth\" outward](http://www.waynesthisandthat.com/images/flytrapclosed.jpg) in the process, and fills with digestive juices. The bug is completely fucked at this point. \n\n5. After digestion the pod opens back up, with the husk of a bug inside. \n     A.

Fly traps have to create a seal after they close. The way is works is as follows : \n\n1.  Insect triggers trap mechanism by touching two different hairs within a 2-15 second interval. \n\n2. Trap closes, with insect inside the outer limits of the flytrap \n\n3. Insect struggles to free itself, continuing to stimulate the hairs, triggering the pod's sealing process. \n     A. If the insect is too large, making the pod unable to seal, the pod will open up, and the bug will be released. \n\n     B. If the insect is dead, and doesn't struggle inside the pod, the pod will not seal. This is why you can't feed a flytrap raw meat or dead bugs. \n\n     C. If a leg or other body part is hanging out of the pod, and that protrusion prevents the pod from sealing, the pod will open back up. \n\n4. The pod seals itself, [folding the \"teeth\" outward](http://www.waynesthisandthat.com/images/flytrapclosed.jpg) in the process, and fills with digestive juices. The bug is completely fucked at this point. \n\n5. After digestion the pod opens back up, with the husk of a bug inside. \n     A. Each pod only has enough energy stored in it to allow it to close a few times. After a couple bugs, or a couple escapes, the trap will die. \n\nSource: I've owned/cultivated flytrap a in the past.

You can experiment with this in a pool or a bathtub.  The only way to create the pressure you need to get something to go in is to suck in, i.e use your lungs and breathing muscles. Water will usually follow the path of least resistance in a closed environment, or when dealing with still water and a new place for the water to flow to (your/the fish's mouth), which means your mouth may fill with water, but there is not any pressure of consequence to that movement.  Fish definitely do have lips, by the way.  They are the outer edges of the opening of the mouth.\n\nIn the end, what you've said is not at all biologically true.  The original comment you replied to was more correct than you are.  The physics of feeding in fish is much more complicated than opening their mouths.  [Here is an example explanation.](http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15301/20150622/fish-bass-muscles-suck-prey-propel.htm).\n\n  Quoted from the article: \"Ultimately, researchers' analysis showed that up to 95 percent of the power required for the suction came from the swimming muscles. The mouth muscles were too weak to produce anything but small amounts of suction.\"\n\nThey use their muscles and gills to provide suction in order to obtain prey, not just opening their mouths.

We used to fish using trot lines for catfish.  We have caught these guy this big before.  They are amazing animals.  This was 24 years ago before protection on them.  If we caught them we would bring them home.  I had this black friend and his dad LOVED to eat them.  I like them too.  One time I took a hickory stick about the diameter of a broom stick and let one of them bite down on it.  It absolutely shattered the stick.  \n\nAbout this skull, how I came about it, and about possessing it....\n\nWhen I found it I called all authorities. I called State Game and fish and talked directly to the guy downtown Montgomery. I was worried even keeping the skull. I did not shoot the thing. I think it is ashamed someone did. The turtle was probably 150 yrs plus old. He was just washed up on my beach. The shell of this guy was about 3-4 feet wide. It was broken in half and sun faded. I was going to try to salvage it and polish it. I have since scrubbed the skull down and bleached it. I keep it on my desk at home. It looks really cool. As if a dinosaur head would. The bottom breastplate of the turtle (also un-salvageable) was as nearly as big as my torso. I could see where some Native American would of loved catching this guy. He would have supper and a set of armor.\nThe guy on the phone told me that they lifted the protection a year ago, but are bringing it back again because of a bunch of problems. So basically it was a mistake to lift the ban. I found this skull in July of 2016. He said I should take a marker and write July 2016 so I can show that I was inside the window of possessing and removing protected herp. species from nature.\n\n"], [12, "If i saw that on deviantart i'd say \"That's too unrealistic... turtles don't have spikes like that.\" Goddammit nature."], [9, "The entire metal genre was inspired by this beast.

We used to fish using trot lines for catfish.  We have caught these guy this big before.  They are amazing animals.  This was 24 years ago before protection on them.  If we caught them we would bring them home.  I had this black friend and his dad LOVED to eat them.  I like them too.  One time I took a hickory stick about the diameter of a broom stick and let one of them bite down on it.  It absolutely shattered the stick.  \n\nAbout this skull, how I came about it, and about possessing it....\n\nWhen I found it I called all authorities. I called State Game and fish and talked directly to the guy downtown Montgomery. I was worried even keeping the skull. I did not shoot the thing. I think it is ashamed someone did. The turtle was probably 150 yrs plus old. He was just washed up on my beach. The shell of this guy was about 3-4 feet wide. It was broken in half and sun faded. I was going to try to salvage it and polish it. I have since scrubbed the skull down and bleached it. I keep it on my desk at home. It looks really cool. As if a dinosaur head would. The bottom breastplate of the turtle (also un-salvageable) was as nearly as big as my torso. I could see where some Native American would of loved catching this guy. He would have supper and a set of armor.\nThe guy on the phone told me that they lifted the protection a year ago, but are bringing it back again because of a bunch of problems. So basically it was a mistake to lift the ban. I found this skull in July of 2016. He said I should take a marker and write July 2016 so I can show that I was inside the window of possessing and removing protected herp. species from nature.\n\n", "id": "da5re5f"}, {"comment": "Lol, a very Alabamian size comparison.

The biggie is that it's totally possible to walk with bigger hips. Also, women's hips change shape as they reach child bearing years and change as they leave those years.\n\nThe metabolic explanation is newer (four years old), so we'll see how it holds up over the decades.\n\nWhat ever the explanation for why, humans are born before they are developmentally ready to fend for themselves.

Botflies are pretty common and generally don't kill their host. In this case, the squirrel looks like it's either young or severely malnourished (look how thin the legs and tail are). This could be from any number of things. If the area had a bad year for acorns, seeds, small prey, or other squirrel foods, he might have just starved to death which makes the botflies look that much worse because of how small it would be. It could have had a different disease which allowed the botflies to get worse than normal. Hell, it could have gotten bitten somewhere we can't see or gotten an infection.

This is immediately followed by how an unarmed human would win. Since I've seen so many of these smaller, very capable animals vs Human scenarios, I'm gonna tell you how to defeat any animal you can lift comfortably. Be it snake, hawk, big dog, (but not big cat, you're fucked there) honey badger, whatever. If you can lift the animal over your head with one arm, you win. It's all about momentum. You'll take a hit, but you'll heal and the animal will die. So if any animal (you can lift) is attacking you and you're without weapons of any kind, you face it down. It will likely jump at you, and go for your head, so be ready for that. Let your arms take the hit and as soon as you make contact, hold onto the animal by any one of its four appendages or tail, if it has a tail. (it's preferable to go for the back legs or tail) As soon as it jumps at you, you grab that appendage and start the swinging motion. Momentum will do the rest. You only need one good half ellipse and as your arm is coming down from the top of your head to your feet, you smash that animals head on the ground. If you've done it right, the force exerted on your swing will not allow the animal to strike you. Not even snakes can fight it. Whether it's grass or dirt or street, if you do it right, that animal's head will hit the ground and it is done for. Do it once, and if the animal survives, it will, at the least, be stunned. Pick it up and do it again and it's over. You can defeat any lift-able animal this way. If you're fast enough, you can swing the critter with one arm and when the swing reaches it's pinnacle over you head, you can two hand it for the downswing to the floor. Basically, think of it like wielding a sledgehammer, using the long arcing reach to create momentum."], [7, "That chicken has large talons."], [4, "Realistically speaking, average 25 year old dude vs this bird.

Jaguar - These mo'fos weigh up to 350 lbs and are the apex predator for all of the Americas south of the range of the grey wolf and brown bear. When these get sick or old they'll decide that they're man eaters now because our flesh-to-difficulty ratio is excellent. They'll hide in the forest near villages and pick people off when they get hungry. When this happens they don't stop until you find and kill them. \n\n2. Cougar - Attacks on humans are extremely rare, but males can get to be 9ft long which is fucking insane, and they're possibly the stealthiest large cat there is. You will never, ever see the attack coming if you're unlucky enough to become prey. \n\n**Paddle out to the middle of the river before you take a dip - they hunt the shallows:**\n\n3. Caimans - What most people don't know is that these have gnarly bacteria in their mouths like a komodo dragon, so a bite normally results in amputation.

Komodo dragons hunt using a potent neurotoxic venom secreted from the lower jaw combined with the raw mechanical damage from their teeth.\n\nReptiles actually have very clean mouths, most bacteria found in the mouths of predators is on and in between their teeth. All reptiles replace their teeth periodically throughout their lives, sometimes even monthly, which prevents bacteria from becoming plentiful compared to mammalian carnivores. What makes a crocodilian bite so dangerous is that since their bite force is so strong the puncture wounds they create are very deep, so this introduces any bacteria to the very vulnerable bone marrow. There an infection can spread very easily.\n\nAnd also, caiman attacks are actually very rare. It's the two species of crocodiles (the Orinoco and American Crocodile) that usually claim human lives.

That was a little factoid I pulled from by childhood \"1001 Animal Facts\" memories, so please forgive me. The fact that caiman bites often lead to amputations is something I was told by a man living in the Brazilian Amazon. His brother was bitten by a caiman while working on a goldmine in the state of Roraima and lost his arm.

Again, this was advice from a man who knew of deaths attributed to anacondas. Whether those were fish stories, I can't tell you. You have to realize though that most of these people are at least 1, normally 2 degrees of separation from anyone who's ever used the internet, so if their accounts of anaconda attacks aren't available to your googling, that's really not all that surprising.

This is immediately followed by how an unarmed human would win. Since I've seen so many of these smaller, very capable animals vs Human scenarios, I'm gonna tell you how to defeat any animal you can lift comfortably. Be it snake, hawk, big dog, (but not big cat, you're fucked there) honey badger, whatever. If you can lift the animal over your head with one arm, you win. It's all about momentum. You'll take a hit, but you'll heal and the animal will die. So if any animal (you can lift) is attacking you and you're without weapons of any kind, you face it down. It will likely jump at you, and go for your head, so be ready for that. Let your arms take the hit and as soon as you make contact, hold onto the animal by any one of its four appendages or tail, if it has a tail. (it's preferable to go for the back legs or tail) As soon as it jumps at you, you grab that appendage and start the swinging motion. Momentum will do the rest. You only need one good half ellipse and as your arm is coming down from the top of your head to your feet, you smash that animals head on the ground. If you've done it right, the force exerted on your swing will not allow the animal to strike you. Not even snakes can fight it. Whether it's grass or dirt or street, if you do it right, that animal's head will hit the ground and it is done for. Do it once, and if the animal survives, it will, at the least, be stunned. Pick it up and do it again and it's over. You can defeat any lift-able animal this way. If you're fast enough, you can swing the critter with one arm and when the swing reaches it's pinnacle over you head, you can two hand it for the downswing to the floor.

Their bite is laced with a potent neurotoxic venom that causes a rapid drop in blood pressure which puts you into shock, you'll be too weak to fight within literal seconds.  \n\n >It will likely jump at you, and go for your head\n\nBut not this one, it will aim for your legs, aiming to bite the Achilles tendon, after that it can finish you off at its leisure. No human is walking away alive from a fight with a komodo with a sliced Achilles tendon.\n\n>Not even snakes can fight it.\n\nSwinging any snake larger than 30kgs is not going to work, these animals are solid muscle, and have more than enough strength to pull any human down and overpower them.\n\nYou do not want to try to outmuscle a constricting snake, you will lose. If you want to kill a large snake in a fight, the last thing you would ever want to do is to try fighting them with your bare hands. Snakes can't move fast, you can get yourself a large stick and club it to death. Throwing stones is also a good strategy. Any other tactic is basically giving the snake the homefield advantage. You grasp any part of a snake, and it's going to be able to loop a coil around you. A large python that is at its optimum temperature can completely coil around you within seconds, and the sheer muscular force they possess will be far too much to allow you to simple throw them off you.\n\nThere is no human that can outwrestle a constricting snake of similar weight. \n\nSo, yes your tactic is useful against certain mammalian predators, but a large reptile will likely be able to overcome you easily.", "id": "d0kksty"}, {"comment": "I can't imagine a komodo dragon taking me out.\n\nI might lose a hand and sever some nerves/tendons or lose some fingers but I'm pretty confident I could break the jaw off a komodo dragon with a foot/knee and both arms.", "id": "d3525yg"}, {"comment": "Are you joking?\n\nFirstly these animals have immensely powerful muscles, a strong bite and very flexible bones.

Blood pressure is key. Whether using a device that gives them a numerical value or using a Doppler device. I prefer the Doppler and tend to use both. Capnograph measures end tidal carbon dioxide and is key for helping knowing anesthetic depth and measure amount of co2 exhaled. Obviously measure heart rate and respiratory rate which can be monitored with something as basic as a stethoscope. Heart rate should be monitored always. There are other devices you can use but those are key for me. I'm lucky that I work in a place that allows me to use these monitoring devices and more. \n\nA huge one for me especially in surgical patients is that your pet is on IV fluids.

Males will only target cubs sired by other males, containing different sets of genes. For example, a male who defeats an incumbent male for mating rights with the females of a pride will slaughter those cubs that were sired by the previous male in order to, as mentioned, haul dem pussies back into action again so he can mate. \n\nThis makes sense through the lens of genetics. A male lion wants to maximise the chance of his own genes being passed on. It's therefore a complete and utter waste of resources to maintain cubs that don't contain his genes (they could also grow up and challenge him for the pride), and he might not be able to control the pride long enough for the existing cubs to reach maturity (about 25 months) and wait to have the females return to heat. Females likewise want to maximise the likelihood of their genes being passed on; and therefore delay ovulation after mating with the new guy, retaining his sperm in the interim, until she's confident that he can retain control long enough for her offspring to survive (this is a form of [cryptic female choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_female_choice)). By waiting until the dust settles, and seeing how well the new guy fends off other advances, she ensures her cubs aren't likely to be killed by another incoming male before they reach adulthood.\n\nBoth sexes therefore have mechanisms to make the most of shifting political situations. Seems brutal for us, but it's win-win for the lions!\n", "id": "d9isga8"}, {"comment": "Do females ever gang up on the new guy in charge and attempt to defend their cubs or do they just let it happen?", "id": "d9j2ka0"}, {"comment": "Not in that sense, but they're clever and try to avoid infanticide if possible. Females already pregnant or with very young cubs will hide the fact, mate with the new lion, and try and pass off said cubs as his. Likewise, they'll often spend much of their time shortly after giving birth away from the pride, and if a new male were to come in at that point, they'll keep attempting to hide the cubs from him for as long as possible - just in case he's ousted, or allowing time for the cubs to grow old enough to survive. \n\nThey don't hand 'em over on a silver platter by any means. The males have to work to kill.

Not only was the volume chock-full of illustrations of feathered dinosaurs, but it also attempted to revise some dinosaur taxonomy. Paul noted the similarities between the skeletons of the Velociraptor from Mongolia and the Deinonychus skeletons from North America. They were so similar, in fact, that he decided to group the Deinonychus fossils under the name Velociraptor, as the older name took precedence according to the rules by which organisms are named. \n\n>Paleontologists did not agree with this change\u2014 Velociraptor was kept distinct from Deinonychus\u2014but Paul\u2019s book was a hit with the general public. And one of the people who read the book was author Michael Crichton. We know this because in the acknowledgements for his novel Jurassic Park, Crichton listed Paul as one of the people who inspired his vision for dinosaurs portrayed in the book, and he used the name Velociraptor to describe the large, sickle-clawed predators that disembowel so many humans in the fictional yarn.

Partly this was guessed because of comparisons between Deinonychus (discovered in 1969) and the bird/dinosaur transitional fossils of the clearly-winged [Archaeopteryx](http://i.imgur.com/xgsfX7q.jpg) (discovered in the 19th century, which had led Thomas Huxley to propose that birds evolved from dinosaurs).

[They use a different hunting style.](http://www.upi.com/Males-lions-excel-as-ambush-hunters/85671363644217/) The clash of an ambush style and a cooperative stalking style probably means it's just easier of the male doesn't hunt. Though personality is also probably a factor, animals can have a lazy personality too.\n\nBut people also tend to forget that a pride probably can't afford to have a male tired out from the hunt. This is a perfect example of why the male doesn't join the females often, he has the energy to chase away the hyenas from the kill, which he might not have had if he had helped kill it.\n\nA worn out male tends to mean a vulnerable pride.

Animals like Lions and Gorillas just explode into muscle and power, do what they need to do, then rest/eat. This is also down to the differences in diet. Cooked food gives us more energy to burn than raw food. Food for a non-Human predator is the most precious resource there is. They cannot afford to waste energy without managing to get a good trade-off.\n\nSo yeah, unlike Humans, most predators are built for explosive attacks, and have adaptations that make said attacks more likely to be a success. We gave up that trait, and most of our strength, for endurance and brain power. Our method of hunting was/is running an animal down and spearing it along the way until it bled out and got exhausted. It was that or making nets/traps, then ambushing them. A common strategy was to make covers out of animal fur, drop them on prey to confuse/entangle it, then launch spears and arrows at it until it died.\n\nThat is until we said \"fuck it\" and just put the slow ones into pens.

Often they steal it from other predators such as hyenas and wild dogs, species whose popular image is as undeservedly low as the lion's is high. Dr. Hans Kruuk, the Dutch zoologist whose studies of hyenas rival Schaller's on lions, says, \u201cIt is clear that . . . lions more often make use of food killed by hyenas than the other way, around.\u201d\n> \n> Kruuk and Schaller independently calculated the scavenging rates of lions and hyenas in the Serengeti and. found that of the cases in which one scavenged from the other's kill, 54 per cent of the kills were made by hyenas and 34 per cent were made by lions. In the remaining cases, it could not be deter mined which had killed the prey. Kruuk and Schaller agree that if a lion can find its food already dead, or steal it from another predator, it will not hunt and kill for itself. To help find scavengeable food, lions have learned to watch for vultures circling in the sky. They will often walk a mile or more to find the carcass below the vultures.", "id": "d9d6u56"}, {"comment": "In my mind, \"scavengers\" doesn't really apply to lions though.

The goal of modern taxonomy is to create monophyletic groups.  The clade that unites Old World and New World monkeys is Simiiformes.  Apes (Hominoidea) including humans are nested within Simiiformes.  Your argument is cherry picking which paraphyletic groups should be allowed.  The biological anthropology courses (i.e. human evolution, fossil record of Primates) at my school teach the same thing.  Elsewhere in this thread, you argued that catarrhine does not denote monkey.  Actually, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's first classification of Cattarhini (1812) **did** describe catarrhines as monkeys.   Finally, the fossil record of the earliest catarrhines (e.g. *Oligopithecus*, *Moeripithecus*) clearly shows them to be very monkey-like, actually resembling large callitrichid platyrrhines more than catarrhines. \n\nSo scientifically, there shouldn't be any problems saying that humans are apes, monkeys, mammals, or fish.

This is because certain adaptations that make us so successful in groups actually make us less successful in a no-holds-barred fight. \nOur ape cousins have almost exclusively fast twitch muscle fibers in their arms, legs and chest. Fast twitch fibers are good for bursts of strength, and this preponderance of fast twitch fibers is what allows apes to perform incredible feats of strength for their size.\nHumans, on the other hand, have more slow twitch fibers, which give us dexterity and endurance. They are what allows us to more effectively use tools and use fine motor skills.\nThe biggest advantage the ape has going for it though is its  jaw strength. In addition to the extra fast twitch fibers, its jaw muscles on either side of the skull are also much thicker. This has the additional effect of limiting the size and capacity of the skull. However, their bite can easily crush bone.

Most philosophers argue that in order for something to truly be pain there must be a way it *feels,* something beyond the mere physical description of it. \n\nWhile this wouldn't prove that insects don't feel pain, it would make it easy to argue that they aren't capable of advanced enough mental states in order to even have feelings, regardless of what physical reactions they might have.

Those are the truly unpredictable ones and those are the ones that kill storm chasers, who have a phenomenal safety record in regard to how dangerous it is I might add.\n\nThe 2013 El Reno tornado that killed Tim Samaras and his crew was one of such tornadoes.  It grew rapidly in size, started going as fast as 55 mph, and took a turn to the northeast very suddenly.  It was unpredictable, and because of that a sizeable amount in the storm chasing community have increased the distance they allow between them and any given tornado.\n\nAll that said though, if I had I to peg a tornado's danger level onto any attribute, it'd be the structural integrity of whatever it hits, wind speed, (to a point), and last but certainly not least, how fast it is moving.

However, there is an answer because Californians tested it during the gold rush. They used to pit grizzlies against bulls, but the bears always won easily by using their paw as a club. Tired with the lack of suspense, they shipped in African lions to raise the stakes. The lions had a reputation for rushing fiercely into the attack and looking very promising at the outset, but in the event the grizzlies killed them as easily as they did the bulls.\n \nThe bear\u2019s edge lies in deploying its enormously strong bone density against the thin skull of the lion (lion strength is more muscular than structural).

This was Siena\u2019s fourth treatment since she was gored by a buffalo on the 4th April 2014. The DSWT was alerted to Siena\u2019s injury by Governors Camp who witnessed the incident and immediately sent a team to help. Both DSWT and Governors Camp have monitored her progress since then and Siena has been treated subsequently on the 10th and 14th of April. By the 17th April, Siena had licked at her wound and removed some of the surface stitches.   Her skin had come away, but the wound/muscle appeared to be healing nicely. As Siena had young cubs the risks of a further treatment were measured carefully and the decision was made to delay any further anesthetic so as not to lower her milk production.    \n\n>By the 28th April it was decided that a sufficient time period had passed since her last treatment to anesthetize Siena again without risk to her or her cubs. Siena was lazing with the pride and her cubs when the Mara Vet Unit darted her for what is hoped to be her final treatment. On examination of the wound the vet, Dr Limo, found no pus or signs of infection. In fact the wound was very dry and healing extremely well. The hole in the muscle, which had been the main concern of everyone involved, had in fact healed and was completely closed. There was only a small piece of skin that was hanging down and required two stitches to be held in place. Dr Limo then cleaned the wound with Peroxide, Iodine and Surgical Spirit before spraying it with Antibiotic Spray and applying Green Clay to prevent infection. Siena was then administered Antibiotics intramuscularly and revived.  \n  \n> To everyone\u2019s surprise, as Siena was coming round from the anesthetic, a large group of buffalo that had been grazing nearby took flight. A young buffalo separated from the herd and ran straight into the pride of lions waiting for Siena. They instantly made an easy kill. The pride shared their unexpected prize with Siena, who took a large piece of meat to eat with her cubs.

The paper's short and worth a read; in some models, humans are apex predators. In others, they are not.\n\nPersonally, I'm of the opinion that an average human dropped into an unfamiliar environment with other apex predators present and no supplies would die, sticks and stones be damned (exceptions like Primitive Technology dude aside). If humans are to be considered apex predators, they are perhaps one of the only occurrences of such that require\u2014in order to sustain that status\u2014outside forces (e.g. fire, to cook the meat; armament to kill prey). While it's true that other predators sometimes use tools (octopus comes to mind, but let's say spiders as well, though they create their tools), those examples are decidedly *not* apex predators.", "id": "d8ptr29"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d8pw5uw"}, {"comment": ">Drop them alone into the wild and they're dead.\n\nI was mostly considering *ideal* climates, to be fair. So for humans, tropic or sub-tropic/mediterranean conditions, and the other apex predators in their respective \"ideal hunting ground.\"\n\nGiven those conditions, a smart human would still be seeking out an omnivorous diet, mostly reliant on scavenging. We'd be closer to boars or hyenas than lions or sharks.\n\n>Advanced tool use is really our species' thing\n\nSure. But not advanced tool *creation*. A shark doesn't need a factory, or any outside source, to produce what it needs to kill and sustain itself. That's the difference that I think most people make when they don't consider humans to be apex predators.\n\nI'm also not sure we can consider tool use \"natural\" at a certain point. Neither guns nor jeeps occur in nature. We could, given time and effort, craft armor capable for tigers to use, so should we grant them some leniency there? If not, why do we give it to humans?\n\nAgain, tool use is notably used by other creatures on the earth, but no apex predators that I'm aware of. Furthermore, the tools that humans do use are not used for refinement of natural features; if we developed a tool to sharpen our nails and teeth to hold a razor's edge and used those things for murder/slaughter, I could see it; a gun doesn't make a human any naturally stronger.\n\n>We never existed at the same time as dinosaurs\n\nAnother valid point: if humans *did* possess modern arms back then, dinosaurs wouldn't be a threat for them either. But take humans like us (homo erectus/homo sapien) back to some of the dinosaur eras without the advent of steel and those humans *are* going to be a food supply. Now, you could argue that those dinosaurs died out and our ancestors didn't. Sure. But they'd be just as easy food for tigers in most cases just the same.\n\n>What sort of species are we supposed to become a food supply for?\n\nProbably the strongest argument for humans to be classified as an apex predator. However, I'd think that a tribe of humans, left unequipped, could make prey for some big cats given the proper environment.

Per capita can also easily be misleading or contain a lot of variation year to year, if the population is small, e.g. Gambia at #1 per capita, only has around 2 million people, or the amount of people executed is small: Gambia executed 9 people in in 2012 ([here's another graphic for the same number you linked](http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2013/04/blogs/graphic-detail/20130413_gdc832.png)), which again, admittedly is a fair bit per capita, but some US states would rank a fair bit higher than the US does as a whole.

Delaware (est. 0.95 million inhabitants) just so happened to execute 1 person in 2012, and thus happened to go over 1 per 1 million inhabitants that year, again beating China. They also had 1 execution in 2011, but 2002-2010 only saw 1 in 2005, then again 1992-2001 saw an average of a bit more than 1 per year. \n\nThen there are some other interesting and/or worrying things like Texas being responsible for about a third of US executions in the past 40 years, Rick Perry being governor during over half of those, [and this graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Death_sentences_United_States_(new).png): while the population hasn't quite doubled yet since 1955, but the number of death row inmates has grown to something like 15-30 times what it was then.", "id": "daxblk7"}, {"comment": "Freedom Units, indeed.", "id": "dawwij3"}, {"comment": "I'm pretty big into conservation and I am actually in favor of captive Orcas.

So I was basically like wtf and panicking as time was running out, as I had no idea how I was going to answer this question. So I picked up this long-dead, preserved lamprey with my bare hands, noticed the hole by its head and remembered learning something about it and just wrote down \"holey\" on my paper as a way of remembering so I could get back to it. But instead of \"holey\", I actually wrote \"holy\", and I never got back to the question before turning it in. Later after the exam was over, I asked my friend what the hell was going on with that lamprey question. She had a very confused look on her face and then we went back to the station to check it out. Turns out the question was actually \"how does this FEED\" (pretty easily answerable). I ended up getting lamprey slime on me, marked down for the wrong answer, and the extreme embarrassment for writing \"holy\" on the exam.

This took an hour before he was satisfied, and seeing an audience he happily led us up onto a hill as the drop-ship flew a pass over the top of us, probably to gloat.

I peered down the hill, and realized he'd arranged the bodies to make out words, so many killed to form:\n\n\nOn your drop ship hull  \nI planted a melta bomb  \nBlood for the Blood God  \nIt was at that point the drop-ship erupted in a violent plume, and crashed down on top of the haiku.

I live on a golf course (not humble brag, it's relevant), and I'm about the right distance to where the balls land for the average golfer from the tee. When my pup was young, she would sneak through the fence and bring back the golf balls that would land. She did this so much, that the other dog (Alaskan Malamute) started howling and howling early one morning. My brother woke up to see what was going on and saw a crowd of golf carts around because pupper took all their golf balls. Fast forward a bit, she would bounce the golf balls out of boredom from the top of the hardwood floor stairs, and it would *clang* on each step. At 3am, my brother recorded a video of it, [posted it to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ5EdKSC3so), and Animal Planet emailed a while later (asking permission to use the video). He told them to story about how she got the golf ball, they asked if she could do it again, which of course she is always doing that, and they sent a camera crew to the house to film. She was featured on Bad Dog and ended up winning Bad Dog of the Week. This was several years ago, and I don't have the video (I tried to find a copy somewhere, but can't find it).
