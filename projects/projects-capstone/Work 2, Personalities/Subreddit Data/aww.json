Even the biggest, baddest alpha in a pack of wolves will usually turn around and run away from even the meekest human. \n\nNow, all that having been said there have been fatal wolf attacks, but there aren't many. Typically, this results from one of 2 situations. The first is if the wolf is rabid (rabies) in which case it'll just try to kill anything and everything. The other is if the wolf has somehow been habituated to humans previously. That might be at play in this video, but they seem to recognize her as part of the pack so it's not a big deal. For others, particularly the ones with her, I'd be a little concerned but not exactly scared.\n\nAt the end of the day, they are wild animals and thus unpredictable so you should steer clear but there's little chance of being attacked by a wolf as a human.

Based on race, there were four possibilities. One of them was in her early twenties with bright red unaturally red hair. Like ariel from the little mermaid red. So I kinda ruled her out from the start. I figured \"she would have had to had this kid at age 15-17. Plus she doesn't look like a mother at all. She's not even paying attention to the kid. She's just typing away on her phone. Not caring at all what this kid is doing.\n\nSo then I looked at the other 3. None of them really stood out as having body language that would suggest they are his mother. \n\nOne by one all three of those women got off the bus. \n\nThen I thought \"Maybe he's with his father?\" But as I looked around there were no adult males that were the same race as this kid. \n\nThen I started thinking maybe he's riding the bus alone. Oh god.....he's going to be loud and obnoxious the whole ride, because he has no parent to shut him up. I can't do anything, because in this world an unrelated adult male talking to a kid telling him to shut up is somehow going to be twisted into abuse. I don't need any kind of legal issues, but god damn kid, shut the fuck up.\n\nThen he goes over to that red haired woman, and says \"mom can I have a candy?\" \n\nThe mom says no, but she's so distracted on her phone that she doesn't even see him reach into her purse anyways and pull out five candy bars. Full size, and just starts eating them. \n\nAnother woman tries telling her \"hey, your son just---\" immediately cut off \"DON'T TELL ME ABOUT MY SON!!! I AM HIS MOTHER, AND I WILL DECIDE WHAT IS RIGHT FOR HIM!!!\"\n\nNow other people who have been annoyed on the bus are kinda going back and forth with her on how she's not even watching or aware that he's been running up and down the isles for 30 minutes. \n\nMeanwhile, the kid is just eating the candy bars, the arguement amungst the adults completely skips over the part where this kid is unsupervised eating five candy bars all at once. Finally, we get to the end of the line, the arguement has died down for about 10 minutes by that point. I get out, and start waiting for my next bus. \n\nShe gets off the bus, and sits right next to me. Reaches into her purse, and starts screaming at the bus which she just got off of and is driving away to wait because she must have dropped her candy bars in her seat. \n\nI contemplated telling her what happened, but then I realised, fuck her. She's just going to cause another scene this time with me, and I don't really care if she knows the truth. It won't change her. It won't make her see the perspective that she should be an attentive parent. All that's going to happen, is she's somehow going to blame me, and then continue being a shitty parent. So I just silently rolled my eyes as that bus completely ignored her and kept driving off. \n\nMeanwhile the kid is now 30 feet away running around in the parking lot. Now for the kicker. \n\nThe bus station we were at? West Blvd Rapid Station. That may not sound firmilier, but if you use google maps to see where it is, and then google map where Tamir Rice was shot about 2 years ago, you'll see it's right across the street. Not a good neighborhood at all. The police don't give a shit, and the gangs don't give a shit. Now the parents don't give a shit either.

But not a fan doodles. Most of them come from BYBs (backyard breeders) who just want to make money, so they put little/no thought into the health and personalities of the pups. They just throw an ad on Craigslist requesting a dog to breed with. This results in sick and short lived pups. A lot of the time they're anxious and touchy (personality is very important when breeding) and then they wind up in the pound because of something like the owners having a baby and the pooch is territorial, or it requires too much money to hire a trainer. \n\nIt's important to thoroughly research your breeder and make sure the parents have their papers! The pups will be more expensive but you're more likely to get a healthier dog with the proper temperament.

The \"indusrialized\" beef industry is the result of having to keep prices low and fat content very high. Unfortunately,  beef is graded on fat inclusion so the major beef buyers won't touch it if it isn't fatty enough. That usually means using corn as a finisher. Why? Because corn is cheap! We could give the cattle and extra 18 months, but why absorb the cost of doing that when we can get them to an acceptable grade so much faster and cheaper with corn? The big buyers want quick beef. The consumer wants cheap beef. If people were regularly willing to spend $7.00/lb, beef ranchers would be happy to use grass only. When people insist on $2.00/lb, it's going to have to be corn.\n\nI could break down pasture raised cattle vs feed lot cattle as well, but I think people probably get the idea.

And to a bored dog, the punishment might be \"worth it\" anyway since chewing the couch is an innately rewarding behavior.\n\nThe dog needs an alternative outlet while people are gone, like puzzle toys stuffed with treats, and definitely shouldn't be left alone with furniture he is known to chew. That, combined with more exercise (mental and physical), are the go-to solutions to this sort of behavior.\n\nBasically once the dog gets to this point, it's the human that fucked up, not the dog.\n\nr/dogtraining is great, read their sidebar first.\n\nedit: and crate training, as others mentioned.

So, very little kids don't have object permanence. When they can't see something, they think it's gone. You mightve noticed that some kids cry during peekaboo until they learn that it is supposed to be a fun game.

I can't imagine having to feed the thing as a pet.\n\nPoint is, people who live in the outdoors a lot have more opportunities to rescue various animals. All of ours were eventually returned to the wild successfully with the exception of the hawk. He just never recovered fully from the poison that brought him to us in the first place. We recognized our first faun by her limp, she'd come graze in the yard with her fawns occasionally, like she knew it was safe. \n\nI think the prong horn was eventually returned as well and was later shot by a hunter because he didn't have the same wariness as others, but that could have just been rumor.

At the end of the two weeks, we brought the puppy back, and my parents bought me a husky beanie baby named [Timber](https://img0.etsystatic.com/027/1/5528382/il_570xN.646919564_3243.jpg) to remember him by. Two weeks later my parents surprised me by secretly buying the puppy. We decided to name him Timber after the stuffed animal. It's pretty crazy because I have a picture that looks almost identical to your first one, and he treated that stuffed animal like one of his own. Anyways that dog was by far the best thing that I could have gotten in my childhood. He was my best friend. Unfortunately, one day Timber got past our backyard gate when a neighbor used it to get home from school, and he ended up getting hit by car. I can still remember every excruciating detail of that hospital room where the veterinarian told me that my best friend had passed away. I ended up asking the vet for Timber's dog collar, so I could put it on the stuffed animal Timber. Till this day I have that stuffed animal on my bed, and it will stay there for the rest of my life.

We will catch her sneaking off the couch if she doesn't hear us coming some times =)) they are hardcore pack animals, i got lucky to have 3 other dogs to help me keep her busy and to use all of that energy (two dobermen and a little westie) they have their routine. mine wakes me up at 8:00am every morning, if i'm not already up, and escorts me to let her out and make sure i put food in her bowl, trumpeting at my side  the whole way, other than that she's silent. no barking at all, except the occasional playful howl when she's feeling friendly. \n\n i love my husky to death and we didn't even plan on getting her, she's my favorite dog we've ever had and i would highly recommend one to any dog lover out there who is at least experienced with raising and training a dog to behave properly. every one who comes over loves our husky and always wants one when they leave. they do shed quite a bit, though!

If you found someone who could, within three weeks of Christmas sell you a puppy, I'd be a little concerned over what sort of dog breeder you are getting the dog from. \n\nBreeders who do a good job will have a list of interested people, long before the puppy is born. To be able to get one that easily, and especially at Christmas, sends up some real warning flags. \n\nYears ago, before I got my first dog, I wanted a Malamute. And the best thing that happened to me was that I contacted a member of [this] (http://alaskanmalamute.org/members). Rather than sell me a puppy, she spent a good hour or so on the phone with me telling me exactly WHY I didn't want a Malamute. She was a success: I didn't get one, and while I still think they are great dogs, I've had many dogs since then, that probably are a much, much better fit for me. \n\nAs at least one other person in this discussion noted, there's a reason why rescue and shelters are stuffed with Huskies and Malamutes. They are amazingly beautiful dogs, but they are not dogs that can be left alone in a house all day to do nothing. They are big, they are hairy, they will go right thru a plate glass window if there's something out there that they want, and unless someone knows that they are about to get a puppy, it's just a bad idea to hand one over to someone as a surprise.

Anyways that dog was by far the best thing that I could have gotten in my childhood. He was my best friend. Unfortunately, one day Timber got past our backyard gate when a neighbor used it to get home from school, and he ended up getting hit by car. I can still remember every excruciating detail of that hospital room where the veterinarian told me that my best friend had passed away. I ended up asking the vet for Timber's dog collar, so I could put it on the stuffed animal Timber. Till this day I have that stuffed animal on my bed, and it will stay there for the rest of my life. ", "id": "cxygtln"}, {"comment": "Oh honey, my heart is aching for you. When your parents \"babysat\" with the puppy, were they really giving it a trial run to see how you would handle having a dog instead of just going out and getting a dog then finding out the hard way that it wouldn't work out? If so, they are very smart parents. When my daughters were growing up, we lived awhile in the country and our acreage bordered a small state park. We had a wonderful red & white husky named Buddy who was so gentle and sweet. When he was a pup, my husband taught him to take food and things from our hands so gently that if it weren't for a bit of lingering dog slobber, we'd hardly ever know he had taken something from our hand. My husband did this because we had young kids and we didn't want Buddy to accidentally bite them being too excited and rough. He and our chow/husky mix, Little Bit, roamed our 135 acres freely and they never went off our property. They were happy as can be there. As you know, huskies, malamutes, & especially wolf hybrids like yours not having been bred so far out from the original wild source strongly retain those original instincts & needs like having to have at least a decent-sized backyard to roam One day, we got a glimpse of a lingering instinct in Buddy we would have never believed we would ever witness coming from our sweet gentle Bud. My husband worked for the state highway department and had  picked up a deer that had just been hit so it was still 'fresh'. The body wasn't very torn up so he got permission from the game warden to take it home for Buddy & Bit. He took the carcass way out in the mown hay field but close enough so we could see it. Of course, the dogs followed the truck and when the carcass was dumped off, Buddy tore into that thing like an animal possessed. He wouldn't let Bit anywhere near it & they usually shared everything. I swear he transformed into something resembling a hellhound. He remained like that the whole time he was eating on that deer. When he had his fill, he came happily trotting home, tail wagging, leaving Bit to finally have a turn. When he got to the house he looked like he had been in a horror movie with the blood all over his face, but he gladly sat still while I cleaned him up & he was our Buddy again. That was nearly 20 years ago and we still talk about that. A side note about that deer carcass: It laid out there for a few days while the dogs gnawed on it a bit more then lost interest. Then one day we looked out in that field and a bald eagle with an enormous wingspan had it's claws into it trying to lift it off the ground & take off with it. That silly bird kept trying & trying but could never get the carcass off the ground more than a few inches. Finally it gave up & flew away. Thanks for sharing your story and I hope I haven't bored you with mine. ", "id": "cxyiajd"}, {"comment": "Damn it...

They're the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"pupper family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Canidae, which includes things from puggers to black labs to huskies.\n\nSo your reasoning for saying a doggo isn't a pupper is because random people \"call the big ones doggos?\" Let's get Great Danes and Labradoodles in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A doggo is a doggo and a member of the pupper family. But that's not what you said. You said a doggo isn't a pupper, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the doggo family something other than pupper, which means you'd only call mastiffs, great pyrenees, and other puppers doggos, too.

Particularly if the person is a 6-max or especially 9-max player who multitables 12 or 16 tables at a time or whatever and is just grinding through like 1,000+ hands per hour, reading the stats numbers on the HUD stats of their opponents and doing a lot of autopilot-ish rapid poker playing.\n\nTo me it seemed like the pros who fared the best in the really long run/grand scheme of things were the guys who just 1-tabled deepstacked heads-up cash games (1-on-1 poker).  Deepstacked (where each player has a stack of at least 200 big blinds) 1-on-1 poker tends to be the most intellectually stimulating, especially at the mid-stakes or high-stakes levels, where the opponents are mostly pretty strong players, and the only way to be longrun profitable is to be even better and smarter than them, and genuinely \"out-leveling\" them/out-thinking them in really complicated, nuanced sorts of ways, by creating false table images for yourself, and studying their table image, and looking carefully for reads on when they like to shift gears, and when they like to *pretend* to shift gears, and what stuff it is that you do/can do to cause them to do x/y/z which you can then exploit to your advantage for 10-20 hands after said thing happens/etc etc.\n\nThat can be a deep/complex enough game to stay interesting for quite a while (i.e. numerous years).\n\n16-tabling 9-handed 2/4 NL on the other hand, can become an extraordinarily mind-numbing affair within a short span of months, and burn even a very talented, strongly profit-motivated player out pretty quickly, if they aren't careful.\n\nIn the grandest of all grand schemes of things, however, I would think that even the mid and high stakes deepstacked 1-on-1 games, although they are the most long-term-interesting and  least burnout-able form of poker, could still start to feel like mental anguish if you just did nothing but THAT all day long, every day, week, after week, month after month, year after year, in a more philosophical sense.  Like, even if you were seeing a lot of genuinely unique/interesting \"spots\" on a daily basis, eventually it would start to feel \"boring\" or \"pointless\" in a more \"existential\" sort of way.  Like \"fuck... I'm only going to be alive for another X amount of years, and I'm literally just sitting here clicking buttons watching digital cards flash around on my screen all day.\"  Especially considering the type of intelligence level it usually takes for a person to be a long-term winner at mid-high or high stakes 1-on-1 poker (probably 140+ I.Q. to beat heads-up 5/10-10/20nl from 2009 onwards, 150+ I.Q. to beat heads-up 25/50nl, and 160+ to beat heads-up 50/100nl and above, unless you were exclusively whale-hunting and never ever playing against any legit-regs ever), combined with that specific sub-format of poker requiring a pretty large amount of imagination and creativity, it would def start to feel pretty intellectually/philosophically \"stifling\" for a lot of those guys, eventually.  They'd feel like even if they were making hundreds of thousands, or in some cases even millions of dollars per year at it, they'd wish they could be spending their time working on something more tangible or world-changing or grand-schemes-interesting-ish than winning at online poker (not all of them, but a lot of them).  I.e. becoming a scifi writer, or theoretical physicist or inventing some new technological gadgets or what have you, etc.  \n\nSo then it turns into a situation where they realize they could either get a sort of \"automatic\"/virtually-\"guaranteed\" (well not guaranteed on an hourly or daily basis, obviously, since even the best deepstacked HU poker player in the world would still have downswings/breakeven periods for as long as several weeks or even several months at times, depending on the volume of hands played per day, but you know what I mean, like, on an annual basis or whatever) massive income at relative \"ease\" and completely within their comfort zone, OR, trade that for something else that could take YEARS to get really good at, and unclear how much money they might make at it, or if they would even succeed at it.  So then some of them end up begrudgingly staying stuck in the \"rut\" of just grinding out gigantic profits as online poker pros, but simultaneously wishing they had done something different with their life, but still realizing they're making insane money for something they were able to start doing as a teenager, without even needing to get a college degree or anything, and making 10x the money their parents made in their entire lifetimes or whatever.  So it ends up being a really tricky/psychologically conflicting spot, life-wise, for a lot of them, and I've seen a lot of these guys rolling around in ferraris but seeming miserable as fuck (and not in the more general, money-doesn't-equal-happiness sense, but in a more specific to longterm-poker-grinding sense, I mean).\n\nAnyway, but yea, basically it can be about a whole lot more than simply learning how to deal with the swings of short term statistical variance.", "id": "d5xw4ne"}, {"comment": "Omg that's a lot of words.", "id": "d5xywll"}, {"comment": "Did you at least make decent money doing it?", "id": "d5xpgq4"}, {"comment": "Ex \"poker player\" here.

This couldn't be more true. A neighbor kid had ferrets growing up. Their house smelled terrible.

It all depends on who's taking care of them - if it's some 13 year old that never cleans their cage / bedding, feeds them the wrong food, and over/under bathes them, they're gonna smell. The reason the \"smelly ferret\" myth is so prevalent is because most people's only experience with ferrets is like yours with the neighbor kid.\n\nThe truth is that if you're a responsible pet owner and can handle 15 - 30 minutes of cage maintenance a day, the smell is less than that of a cat. I've had countless people over at my apartment since I've had my ferrets and no one's complained about the smell. In fact, some people were even surprised to find out I had ferrets. Like with any pet, it all comes down to the owner. For me, I've had several different kinds of pets over the years but ferrets have been my favorite by far.

Such as they chew stuff, use the restroom everywhere, etc.?", "id": "d7rck3m"}, {"comment": "They're not the easiest pet to own but not the hardest either. While most of the time they won't chew on wires or random things, you should always watch them when you let them out. They are insanely curious and highly intelligent so they will get into absolutely anything and everything. Nothing is too high for a ferret to climb or too tight for them to squeeze into. They also have a tendency to knock things over to take a look into them.\n\nYou can litter train them like cats but at their best they're only around 75% accurate. Mine go back in their cage most of the time but if they're feeling lazy / just woke up from a nap, sometimes they use the nearest corner. You could potentially solve this problem by putting litter boxes in every corner but I haven't bothered since mine aren't that bad about it.\n\nAs far as bonding goes, they definitely form a bond of their own even if it's not quite like a cat or a dog. They're definitely more independent and autonomous than most domestic animals. It might take a while to get used to their personalities, but I've found that it helps to explain their behavior if you think of them as little people. They're incredibly entertaining to own and probably one of the cutest / coolest pets you can legally have. They're totally unlike any other pet I've had, and I've had a few.\n\nPS; if you're seriously considering getting a ferret, check in over at /r/ferrets for some good info. In particular, make sure to look at the kibble comparison chart to get them quality food if you decide to get them - so many people feed their ferrets undigestable food that cuts their lifespan in half.", "id": "d7rhbf6"}, {"comment": "I know you have to be careful with ovens and dishwashers because they'll slink themselves in there and kill themselves", "id": "d7rdzy0"}, {"comment": "Can confirm: had a ferret die in a dishwasher when I was a kid.

You're already worried and then you finally find a vet who is able to even begin to treat an animal like yours and you go in only to find out that the animal is illegal for you to have and the vet has to confiscate the animal (and in many cases put it down).

I stayed late for band practice and when I came out, there he was, waiting for me. There were a whole lot of kids leaving school, because there was chorus rehearsal too, and they all walked right past him and one guy, the skinny guy who plays clarinet? He threw a wadded-up piece of paper at him, hit him right on his nose. But he didn\u2019t move. Till he saw me. Then his tail thumped. He probably ran away from someone cruel. I think he\u2019s been abused. Look how his leg is bent funny.\n\nAnd he\u2019s hungry. I gave him the leftovers from my lunch. The crusts. I never eat the crusts. And he didn\u2019t mind that there was some mayonnaise stuck to them. Lettuce, too. He even ate the lettuce. That proves he\u2019s starving. Most dogs don\u2019t like lettuce.\n\n\nIf I didn\u2019t give him my lunch he would probably be dead by now.\n\n\nWell, yeah, okay, it was tuna fish, too. I\u2019ve told you a million times I don\u2019t like tuna fish. He\u2019s really smart, you can tell. Just in that short walk home? I taught him to heel. He walked all the way right by my side.\n\n\nThat was after I gave him the sandwich.\n\n\nWe could teach him to be a watchdog. We really need a watchdog. Remember that guy who came selling magazine subscriptions, and you couldn\u2019t get him to leave? I bet anything we could teach this dog to bite guys coming up the walk with magazines. No, not the mailman. Of course not the mailman.\n\n\nSo can I keep him?\n\n\nWe wouldn\u2019t even have to buy a leash. Or a bowl. We still have all that stuff. It\u2019s in the closet.\n\n\nAnd see the size of his neck?

Yes, there is a difference between a sea lion and a seal. Adorable guy, I love baby sea lions! \n\nAlso, no, you should not pet wild sea lions. They are predators and have incredibly sharp teeth. Also, they're very strong, and those flippers are no joke. \n\nSource: zookeeper, have worked with sea lions before, among myriad other animals.\n\nEdit: Okay, since you asked... the main differences between a seal and a sea lion, on a high level:\n\nIt can be confusing, because sea lions are in the family of pinnipeds known as \"eared seals\", and that's pretty much the biggest difference right there. They have external ear flaps on their heads, where true seals only have holes. If you're looking at a head peeking out of the water, this will be your easiest tell. \n\nOther obvious differences to look for: \n\nA seal has a round, blobby body shape. Sea lions are trim and athletic looking.\n\nSeals only have short front and back flippers, and their locomotion on land is... bouncy. Sea lions have a pelvis that will rotate their hind flippers under their bodies and allow them to \"walk\" on land, so their locomotion is upright.\n\nGenerally speaking, though not hard and fast: sea lions tend to be uniform in color, some shade of brown. Seals are more likely to be a combination of neutral colors (white, black, gray, etc.) and have a pattern on their coat-- usually spots. \n\nThings get a little muddy because there are also fur seals, which are actually eared seals, like the sea lion, (they have ear flaps and can rotate their hind flippers, etc.), but the name there has stuck. \n\nSea lions are more likely to be found in large groups, frequently piled on top of one another. Seals are more likely to be found alone, or may bask with a large group but be distinctly separated from the others.\n\nThere are other, smaller, more subtle differences, but if you're just trying to ID which type you're looking at on a beach or in the water, this should get you there."], [230, "Sad to think that only a couple of years ago, Heidi Klum woulda been by his side."], [87, "Kidnaps a baby sea lion for the sweet sweet karma."], [68, "What did he order?

Adorable guy, I love baby sea lions! \n\nAlso, no, you should not pet wild sea lions. They are predators and have incredibly sharp teeth. Also, they're very strong, and those flippers are no joke. \n\nSource: zookeeper, have worked with sea lions before, among myriad other animals.\n\nEdit: Okay, since you asked... the main differences between a seal and a sea lion, on a high level:\n\nIt can be confusing, because sea lions are in the family of pinnipeds known as \"eared seals\", and that's pretty much the biggest difference right there. They have external ear flaps on their heads, where true seals only have holes. If you're looking at a head peeking out of the water, this will be your easiest tell. \n\nOther obvious differences to look for: \n\nA seal has a round, blobby body shape. Sea lions are trim and athletic looking.\n\nSeals only have short front and back flippers, and their locomotion on land is... bouncy. Sea lions have a pelvis that will rotate their hind flippers under their bodies and allow them to \"walk\" on land, so their locomotion is upright.\n\nGenerally speaking, though not hard and fast: sea lions tend to be uniform in color, some shade of brown. Seals are more likely to be a combination of neutral colors (white, black, gray, etc.) and have a pattern on their coat-- usually spots. \n\nThings get a little muddy because there are also fur seals, which are actually eared seals, like the sea lion, (they have ear flaps and can rotate their hind flippers, etc.), but the name there has stuck. \n\nSea lions are more likely to be found in large groups, frequently piled on top of one another. Seals are more likely to be found alone, or may bask with a large group but be distinctly separated from the others.\n\nThere are other, smaller, more subtle differences, but if you're just trying to ID which type you're looking at on a beach or in the water, this should get you there.", "id": "czogruy"}, {"comment": "A good rule of thumb is to just not fuck with wild animals, no matter how cute or harmless they look.

It's possible to keep them well and nicely, but it requires a fair bit of knowledge, discipline, preparation and experience.\n\nBut wolfdogs are not good pets. They tend to be hard to train and less people pleasing, they also have stronger instincts and can be more obstinate and aggressive.\n\nBut God damn are they gorgeous. \n\nIf you want a \"wolfdog\" your best bet is to go with a dog that's been bred to look like a wolf, not a hybrid. Lot of designer breeds out there, though usually they are prone to have health issues due to poor breeding practices, so do your research. \n\nE: autocorrect \n\nEdit2: I'm not an expert, I just spent a long time looking into his because I wanted a wolfdog a long time ago as well. Every single sign points to \"don't get one, you don't know what you're getting into\". If you're thinking about getting one, don't. They're a lot more than you think, and they have wild animal in them, which makes them very unpredictable at times, and downright dangerous. While it's possible to get a nice one, it still requires a lot of care. If you *really* want a wolfdog, look into a malamute or tamaskan dog. They're all dog, but look fairly similar to a wolf (the tamaskan being almost spot on). They're not exactly easy dogs, but they are still dogs. They require a fair bit of yard real estate, and a lot of exercise. They can also be a bit obstinate, but not more so than a normal dog. They're more like big shepherds in temperament iirc. \n\nSeriously though, don't get a wolfdog. They're hard to train, and even house break/train. And even \"advanced\" dog owners should stay away. Maybe if you live in the Alaskan wilderness and don't mind the thought that your dog might snap one day if you startle it and kill you or hurt someone you care about. \n\nAgain *they're not easy, and nowhere near as dog like as you think*.

First, calculate it's walk rate and extrapolate how long it will take for it to walk very long distances so you have a good idea on when it will arrive.\n\n3.  Then fly to Japan and choose someone competent and then afterwards tell them the whole story and give them this survival guide.  Based on its walk speed, then have them fly across the globe to USA right when it arrives in Japan.  Let's say this is 6 months.  Then they give it to a USA person and FULLY educate them on the gravity of the situation and the survival guide.  Then in 6 months the US person travels to Japan/China and does it again.\n\n4.  With each successful trip and transfer to a new person you are putting more and more space between you and the 'it' but this only works when everyone above your chain is competent to survive.  That's also why each new person in your 'it' chain is added to a facebook group where they all talk and checkin regularly.  That way everyone is educated properly and the its location is always understood.  \n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, if anyone in your facebook group fails to check in and has succumbed to the 'it' then everyone down the line  is aware and the previous person will need to do another across the world trip to keep the 'it' forever walking.\n\nSurvive!", "id": "d6wqece"}, {"comment": "Lol reminding me of the guy getting slow beat to death by the demon with a spoon lol", "id": "d6wou13"}, {"comment": "And we can throw shit farther.", "id": "d6wfx7b"}, {"comment": "Most primates are pretty damn good at throwing shit actually.", "id": "d6wgciv"}, {"comment": "Not nearly as accurately though.

They're a lot more independent than your average dog that constantly wants to be up your butt, so they're less interested in \"making you happy\" so to speak, and they get bored if things get too repetitive. Sometimes they're called \"cat like\" for this reason. They're ridiculously stubborn.\n\nSome people like the challenge, and some people hate it. Personally, I'd probably go crazy if I had a dog as obsessively doting and in my space as a Lab. :P\n\nSpitz are hilarious, vocal, fussy, high energy, opinionated dogs, but not exactly what you'd want if you're looking to do competitive training or anything. (One exception - American Eskimo Dogs. Really smart and fantastic at trick training, and used as circus dogs in the early 20th century.)

He developed this about 7 years ago and we have had about 5 actual times he had to go out.

They love to play fetch and are very \"partner focused\" if that makes sense - they want to work with you as a team. \n\nHuskies are more independent and prefer doing stuff like running around, exploring, hiking, chasing, and playing with toys by themselves. They love attention and can be cuddly (and unlike other Spitz, I feel like they often love *everyone*, not just their own people) and they're very playful and goofy. GSDs are more shy with strangers, I believe.\n\nHuskies are sassy, independent, loving, playful, and big drama queens. I feel like they just have a lot of \"personality\" in a way.

However, let's not forget that such comparisons between brain structures have led us astray in the past - for example, according to that logic, all birds should be dumb as dirt since they lack the neocortex necessary for higher thinking (as well as a few other functions) in mammals. Obviously that's not the case, with parrots and corvids being prime examples of bird intelligence, and indeed we later realized that birds have a way of processing these functions without a neocortex. It's possible that what fish seemingly lack in pain-processing neurons (as viewed from a mammal-centric perspective), they make up for in other ways.\n\nFurthermore, there seem to be an awful lot of studies pointing to the capacity of fish to avoid painful stimuli or to obtain relief from painkillers. Below are a few pages which compile several of these studies, plus other relevant essays on the subject - and there are many more of those out there both in journals and on the web. It's not impossible that some of the studies had shortcomings that we don't know about, but overall they seem pretty convincing to me especially when put together. \n\nhttp://www.fishpain.com/fish-and-pain-remembering-pain.htm\n\nhttp://www.fishpain.com/fish-and-pain-analgesic.htm\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-bekoff/fish-feel-pain_b_8881656.html\n", "id": "d4lgssd"}, {"comment": "yeah same here, don't come to this sub to see an animal get eaten", "id": "d4li8k2"}], [{"comment": "Is OP accusing this dog of fishing for compliments?", "id": "d4l4apb"}, {"comment": "No, for belly rubs", "id": "d4lc97j"}], [{"comment": "That bear needs to catch his own damn fish", "id": "d4lg0ai"}, {"comment": "Was wondering if anyone else's eyes saw how that dog looked like a bear.

I've traveled through quite a few countries and lived in three (including Georgia) - it should be at the top of any traveler's list. \n\nIf you're into hiking, camping, or nature, it's **the** place to be.  I went with a group of friends to [Vardzia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardzia) (a [cave monastery](http://i.imgur.com/UyuY0HC.jpg) in the west), then camped in Khertvisi, an ancient half collapsed fortress.  Our campfire [crept the walls](http://i.imgur.com/hOejj5z.jpg), we [climbed after](http://i.imgur.com/PTMzh8n.jpg), then I took a dump in the same squatter toilet as Alexander the Great.  \n\nThis is why Georgia is my favorite hiking country - the access to most areas worth going is unfettered.  The fortress is used during the day as a place for cows to [hang out and shit](http://i.imgur.com/bakHw4z.jpg).   When we wanted a weekend trip, we picked a village near some cool nature, found a [marshrutka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshrutka) going there, and hopped on.  On the way/ on arrival we found  some shop to buy drink and food, and set of for some place to camp.  It was beauty.\n\nIf you like partying, Tbilisi has grown quickly into an interesting and diverse place.  Now there are interesting bars, an ok selection of clubs, and countless Georgians to drink and eat with.\n\nSuggestions, recommendations (all about a year out of date, fyi): \n1. Go to Davit Gareja, hike along the border of Azerbaijan and see an interesting cave city.  On the way back, stop at a small town call Udabno and stay the night at the Oasis hostel and restaurant.  Order [nadughi](http://i.imgur.com/KKU5wH1.jpg) if they have it.\n\n2. Go to DIVE bar (hardish to find, but many know it) for an ultra -relaxed and cheap time.  Party with imports and Georgians in equal measure, play some beer pong, and order a bottle of the polish vodka - cheap spicy shots for your new friends!.  Canudos is a younger, more Georgian crowd (early twenties typically), with equally awesome prices and a central asian vibe.\n\n3. Go to Tiflis on Kandelaki Street for consistently delicious Georgian made for Georgians (though it has the overly loud music local places are known for).  Save Machakhela for late night drunk food, it's a TGIFriday's.  \n\n4. Sololakis Kari off of Freedom Square is another great place for dinner with regular Georgian dance shows!  A little hokey but fun.\n\n5. Cafe Flowers and 144 Steps are each beautiful cafes, way up a hill, overlooking the other's side of the river.  Try both!\n\n6. Cafe Gallery for dancing your ass off to techno in a liberal atmosphere (or a quiet book-read during the day).\n\n7. Batumi is a beach city frequented by many regional tourists.  Rent a little guest house and play pool on the boardwalk for a little ritzier time. \n\n8. Svaneti is a hiker's paradise, but hard to get into and out of. Crazy Marshrutka rides every single time!\n\n9. There are many, many, many more. \n\nEDIT: I forgot what sub I was in!

I've traveled through quite a few countries and lived in three (including Georgia) - it should be at the top of any traveler's list. \n\nIf you're into hiking, camping, or nature, it's **the** place to be.  I went with a group of friends to [Vardzia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vardzia) (a [cave monastery](http://i.imgur.com/UyuY0HC.jpg) in the west), then camped in Khertvisi, an ancient half collapsed fortress.

On the way/ on arrival we found  some shop to buy drink and food, and set of for some place to camp.  It was beauty.\n\nIf you like partying, Tbilisi has grown quickly into an interesting and diverse place.  Now there are interesting bars, an ok selection of clubs, and countless Georgians to drink and eat with.\n\nSuggestions, recommendations (all about a year out of date, fyi): \n1. Go to Davit Gareja, hike along the border of Azerbaijan and see an interesting cave city.  On the way back, stop at a small town call Udabno and stay the night at the Oasis hostel and restaurant.  Order [nadughi](http://i.imgur.com/KKU5wH1.jpg) if they have it.\n\n2. Go to DIVE bar (hardish to find, but many know it) for an ultra -relaxed and cheap time.  Party with imports and Georgians in equal measure, play some beer pong, and order a bottle of the polish vodka - cheap spicy shots for your new friends!.  Canudos is a younger, more Georgian crowd (early twenties typically), with equally awesome prices and a central asian vibe.\n\n3. Go to Tiflis on Kandelaki Street for consistently delicious Georgian made for Georgians (though it has the overly loud music local places are known for).  Save Machakhela for late night drunk food, it's a TGIFriday's.  \n\n4. Sololakis Kari off of Freedom Square is another great place for dinner with regular Georgian dance shows!  A little hokey but fun.\n\n5. Cafe Flowers and 144 Steps are each beautiful cafes, way up a hill, overlooking the other's side of the river.  Try both!\n\n6. Cafe Gallery for dancing your ass off to techno in a liberal atmosphere (or a quiet book-read during the day).\n\n7. Batumi is a beach city frequented by many regional tourists.  Rent a little guest house and play pool on the boardwalk for a little ritzier time. \n\n8. Svaneti is a hiker's paradise, but hard to get into and out of. Crazy Marshrutka rides every single time!\n\n9. There are many, many, many more. \n\nEDIT: I forgot what sub I was in!

Our campfire [crept the walls](http://i.imgur.com/hOejj5z.jpg), we [climbed after](http://i.imgur.com/PTMzh8n.jpg), then I took a dump in the same squatter toilet as Alexander the Great.  \n\nThis is why Georgia is my favorite hiking country - the access to most areas worth going is unfettered.  The fortress is used during the day as a place for cows to [hang out and shit](http://i.imgur.com/bakHw4z.jpg).   When we wanted a weekend trip, we picked a village near some cool nature, found a [marshrutka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshrutka) going there, and hopped on.  On the way/ on arrival we found  some shop to buy drink and food, and set of for some place to camp.  It was beauty.\n\nIf you like partying, Tbilisi has grown quickly into an interesting and diverse place.  Now there are interesting bars, an ok selection of clubs, and countless Georgians to drink and eat with.\n\nSuggestions, recommendations (all about a year out of date, fyi): \n1. Go to Davit Gareja, hike along the border of Azerbaijan and see an interesting cave city.  On the way back, stop at a small town call Udabno and stay the night at the Oasis hostel and restaurant.  Order [nadughi](http://i.imgur.com/KKU5wH1.jpg) if they have it.\n\n2. Go to DIVE bar (hardish to find, but many know it) for an ultra -relaxed and cheap time.  Party with imports and Georgians in equal measure, play some beer pong, and order a bottle of the polish vodka - cheap spicy shots for your new friends!.  Canudos is a younger, more Georgian crowd (early twenties typically), with equally awesome prices and a central asian vibe.\n\n3. Go to Tiflis on Kandelaki Street for consistently delicious Georgian made for Georgians (though it has the overly loud music local places are known for).  Save Machakhela for late night drunk food, it's a TGIFriday's.  \n\n4. Sololakis Kari off of Freedom Square is another great place for dinner with regular Georgian dance shows!  A little hokey but fun.\n\n5. Cafe Flowers and 144 Steps are each beautiful cafes, way up a hill, overlooking the other's side of the river.  Try both!\n\n6. Cafe Gallery for dancing your ass off to techno in a liberal atmosphere (or a quiet book-read during the day).\n\n7. Batumi is a beach city frequented by many regional tourists.  Rent a little guest house and play pool on the boardwalk for a little ritzier time. \n\n8. Svaneti is a hiker's paradise, but hard to get into and out of. Crazy Marshrutka rides every single time!\n\n9. There are many, many, many more. \n\nEDIT: I forgot what sub I was in! This is the [doggie](http://imgur.com/a/ralYz) that we adopted in Georgia and now have with us in the US.\n\nTL;DR Go to Georgia immediately.

When fed in reasonable amounts, garlic is a fantastic ingredient to a homemade dog food diet.

She would walk along the beach with us when we were young and nudge us away from the water with her nose subtly. She used to swim around us in the ocean and unfailingly bark along edges of pools for us to get out. Not safe!! My whole life, when I was sick or very upset she would crawl up onto the couch and snuggle into me without any encouragement, she could just tell. Goldens won't let you suffer alone, they become your therapist. I found my dog kept my mood steady.\n\nAt first, admittedly, I thought she would be a huge wimp and not protect me if anything were to pose a threat. But I was so wrong. She was gentle and relatively submissive with other dogs and strangers UNLESS they messed with me. \n\nOne day, when our neighbour's big dog who was tied barked viscously at me on a walk (dog was crazy), my dog ran over and flipped him on his back with her mouth over his throat. She growled for a few seconds before releasing him and then trotted back over to me. I could barely believe my eyes. Another time, when I was on my front porch (one dark evening) she heard rustling as my dad approached and bared her teeth. She was poised to attack with a sound I never imagined was possible coming out of her mouth, hackles raised. She would have attacked him if he hadn't called out, 100%. I distinctly remember this handful of moments over her lifetime when her internal switch just flipped and she went into protection mode. It was like she was a different dog! \n\nDon't get me wrong though -she was always super friendly to strangers and other dogs besides these few times and with the exception of this ONE GUY.\n\nThis one man walked through our neighborhood a lot. Everyone living nearby assumes he is a creep based on how much my dog hated his guts. She had a way of reading people that I would never question. My mom even tried to introduce him to our dog once and she went ballistic, trying to attack him. My guess is he hurt her as a puppy on one of his walks. I hate him now... Even though he claimed that he didn't do anything when my mom straight up accused him (wow mom lol).\n\nI'm 21 now and she passed away a couple years ago. Couldn't have asked for a better best friend to grow up with. \n\nTo answer your other question, our golden was ridiculously smart and easy to train. \"Ruled by food\" we called her. \n\nOne thing I would note though is that goldens require more affection than other dogs. In my experience, they thrive on it and love pleasing their people. Similarly, they can also get stressed and upset if you don't have your shit together... Like if you change their food and bathroom schedule or don't take them out for playtime or have a heated argument in front of them or (god forbid) lash out at them.

Dogs have their own language and being patient and open helps you communicate to each other. Have non-verbal conversations with your dog is the best.

I\u2019ve had no desire to explain, but won\u2019t be around forever and must.\nDogs never die. They don\u2019t know how to. They get tired, and very old, and their bones hurt. Of course they don\u2019t die. If they did they would not want to always go for a walk, even long after their old bones say: 'No, no, not a good idea. Let's not go for a walk.' Nope, dogs always want to go for a walk. They might get one step before their aging tendons collapse them into a heap on the floor, but that's what dogs are. They walk.\nIt\u2019s not that they dislike your company. On the contrary, a walk with you is all there is. Their boss, and the cacaphonic symphony of odor that the world is. Cat poop, another dog\u2019s mark, a rotting chicken bone (exultation), and you. That\u2019s what makes their world perfect, and in a perfect world death has no place.\nHowever, dogs get very very sleepy. That\u2019s the thing, you see. They don't teach you that at the fancy university where they explain about quarks, gluons, and Keynesian economics. They know so much they forget that dogs never die. It\u2019s a shame, really. Dogs have so much to offer and people just talk a lot.\nWhen you think your dog has died, it has just fallen asleep in your heart. And by the way, it is wagging its tail madly, you see, and that\u2019s why your chest hurts so much and you cry all the time. Who would not cry with a happy dog wagging its tail in their chest. Ouch! Wap wap wap wap wap, that hurts. But they only wag when they wake up. That\u2019s when they say: 'Thanks Boss! Thanks for a warm place to sleep and always next to your heart, the best place.'\nWhen they first fall asleep, they wake up all the time, and that\u2019s why, of course, you cry all the time. Wap, wap, wap. After a while they sleep more. (remember, a dog while is not a human while. You take your dog for walk, it\u2019s a day full of adventure in an hour. Then you come home and it's a week, well one of your days, but a week, really, before the dog gets another walk. No WONDER they love walks.)\nAnyway, like I was saying, they fall asleep in your heart, and when they wake up, they wag their tail. After a few dog years, they sleep for longer naps, and you would too. They were a GOOD DOG all their life, and you both know it. It gets tiring being a good dog all the time, particularly when you get old and your bones hurt and you fall on your face and don\u2019t want to go outside to pee when it is raining but do anyway, because you are a good dog. So understand, after they have been sleeping in your heart, they will sleep longer and longer.\nBut don\u2019t get fooled. They are not 'dead.' There\u2019s no such thing, really. They are sleeping in your heart, and they will wake up, usually when you\u2019re not expecting it. It\u2019s just who they are.\"\n\nEdit:Thank you for the gold! I really do appreciate it.

We picked her up as a 7 week old puppy from some guy running a small broken down shop on the side of a backroad. When we got her she was almost dead already. Completely covered by ticks and fleas, we took the time to comb and pick off every. damn. one. She became part of the family quickly. She was the outcast of the pack, the other 3 grew to tolerate her, but isolated her. She became my little girl. No matter how late it was, she'd be waiting for me to come home, everything I did, she was right by my side. June 4th of 2015 we found her laying by the barn barely breathing. \n\nTurns out she had diabetes and was seizing. We had no idea, she hadn't shown any signs whatsoever, we had her at the vet for a checkup a couple months prior and everything was fine. June 6th, I visited her in the vet before school. We knew the chances, we knew it was coming, but we were hoping for the best. She couldn't move, she was alive but not responding to anyone. As soon as I went in the room she was in and called her name she opened her eyes and tried to perk up. She had enough energy to give me kisses one last time. That afternoon at 1:45pm she had a violent seizure, and we followed vet recommendations to put her down.

You can talk them into it, but it's often a bit of a struggle, where, say, many collies and retrievers just absolutely live to do what you ask.\n\nReminds me of my mom's corgi, Corky.\n\nBack when my mom lived out in the country in eastern Montana, she owned three corgis, total; Corky, however, was the most corgi out of all of them. Corky was smart, fast, playful, and, as you say, not very interested in deferring to people all the time.\n\nFor example, when she went on walks, she would usually stay in her collar but, when she thought it was time to slip the leash, she'd slip it, and that was that. However, she wasn't stupid. She didn't run off. Instead, she'd turn it into a game: She'd stay *just* out of reach as you tried to put the leash back on. You'd move forwards, she'd move back, you'd go one way, she'd go the other, just far enough that you couldn't collar her until *she* was ready, but not so far that you'd stop trying.\n\nUltimately, of course, she did respond to commands, and, since we had a fenced-in field, she did get time to just run outside completely off-leash and chase frisbees around. She'd listen, but every so often, she had to remind you she didn't *automatically* obey.", "id": "d99mije"}, {"comment": "This is the problem of every working dog that hasbecome a pet.

She just blinked and went to the door, waiting to be let out to go fetch the paper as she always did every morning, rain or shine.\n\nThey made it three days before it was decided that whoever was up first would throw out a saved paper for her to fetch when she come downstairs with the other parent. She'll be 11 in a few weeks, and has been fetching since the Sunday paper was bigger than her. They can try but they'll never steal her job!\n\nEdit: I'm heading home this weekend, I'll get y'all a video of the old girl doing her morning job! (During the day she's my mother's office mascot. But only when she wants to, some days she's a lazy potato who'd rather get a treat and then curl up in her bed)\n\nEdit Edit: Thank you for the gold, Penny doesn't know what that is but if it means she gets more cookies then she'll take it!

One morning though... Well, one morning she didn't come back (don't worry). So after about two minutes my dad started calling her, and when he got no response he went out to find her, but she was nowhere in sight (it was dark). Instead, what he found was a large pile of papers of all varieties ranging from the local to the national deposited on our lawn. So he called her again and this time she came racing back from somewhere down the street, happy as could be and with somebody else's paper in her mouth.\n\nApparently she'd just discovered that other houses also got the paper and decided that while she'd always been a good dog, being a good dog wasn't enough.

Ordinarily that was too little for a delivery but the boss had told me the guy was elderly and unable to come in himself, so we were more than happy to oblige to help the guy out. Now this is not uncommon so I simply thought the guy couldn't move around well enough to drive to the restaurant. Upon arriving I saw the guy through his front window and he was hooked up to devices and did not appear that he would be able to answer the door. So I was prepared to have to go inside and get more involved than deliveries usually required, which can be a mix of awkward and creepy as I have seen literally from the biggest estates to the smallest plywood shacks (my area in Long Island, NY has a fairly diverse economic demo within about 15 minutes of one another) and this guys house was not going to be super tidy as would be expected. \n\nSo as I approach the door, I give a courtesy knock and a voice comes from the living room to \"Open the door\". The front door is a typical no windows door, so as I open it I'm expecting to walk right in. When I swing the door open to step inside I jump a bit as I am greeted by an eagerly waiting Golden Retriever. Absolutely beautiful girl, probably a few years old as she is full grown and is still all golden (no white in her face yet). I LOVE dogs so I give her a big hello and as I am about to walk around her the older gent shouts, \"she has the money!\" Well if that wasn't just super cute enough, she was a good tipper too! I take the money out of her collar as I figure she is just excited and wants to be involved. I am about to go give the guy his sandwich and he shouts again (not that important but the hero comes all wrapped in foil and wax paper, then put in a brown bag and is rolled up and stapled which gives it a flat edge at the top). \"Just put it down there\", he says and I was just thinking; no way! Sure enough the sweet little lady delicately grabs the sandwich by the edge of the bag, gets one last ear scratch from me and trots back to the living room happy as can be totting the sandwich. \n\nThe whole transaction was carried out by his helper dog, from payment to delivery and let me tell you that made my entire week. I still often think about how friggin awesome that dog was and it brings a smile to my face, you couldn't ask for a better friend in the whole world! (God knows as good as my dogs are, they could never be trusted with the safe delivery of my lunch!) \n\nWell that's my story of my favorite delivery. Sorry it's a bit long-winded but I feel the set up makes the story more endearing. Also, I've never written it out before and as I realized how long it was getting I was already in too deep.\n\n\n\n*It's brought an even bigger smile to my face to know that a bunch of you guys have enjoyed my story as well!

This past December, a couple days before Christmas, we had to make the decision to put our dear PennyDog down. It absolutely broke my heart. It was the first pet that I have ever had for any length of time that I fell in love with. We got her a month and a half after we lost our first pregnancy (my wife miscarried at home at 19.5 weeks while I was out of town). Penny became our new \"child\". She was part of our grieving process. She was beautiful, very chill, never messed anything up, barked at anyone, or anything like that. We were lucky enough to have her for 9 wonderful years. We found out that she had a tumor on her back leg, her heart wasn't doing well, and her kidneys were only functioning at 25%. We tried saline treatments for a while to help give her kidneys a break, but she started going downhill and we knew we had to make that decision. It was heart-wrenching. I'm about to cry just typing this out. It's amazing how close you can bond with an animal like that. I seriously think it hurt me in my gut more than it did when we lost our baby. Not that I didn't hurt bad when that happened, but I had never bonded with our unborn child, so it was a little different. We miss PennyDog every day and wish there was some way to get her back. I always feel so very bad hearing about anyone who has lost a beloved pet.

But that sucks because they are such WONDERFUL companions and because they are worth money, sleazeballs will look to take them off your hands for cheap or as a \"favor\" (and they pretend to be good people) and then the birds wind up sold for more money and in bad circumstances with people who do not have patience or understand their habits.\n\nIt's time to be honest with your Mom, too, if you aren't sure you can take on the bird.

I'm comfortable talking with her and she knows my living situation isn't ideal to suddenly adopt a parrot, but both our circumstances will probably change significantly in the next decade so neither of us are worried about it for now.

I've taken care of him for a couple weeks in the past, changing food/water/newspaper, etc without letting him out of his cage, and he definitely knows me, recognizes me and is comfortable talking to me and letting me get my hands near him, feeding him, but I've never tried letting him perch or petting him, so I guess we'd see. \n\n They're across the country from me, so sadly my current opportunities  to bond are limited,  but I'm comfortable enough with the idea that if something happens I can keep him relatively well cared for and alive, if not super happy. Thanks for the advice about fostering, if it comes to it, I'll be sure to keep in mind the idea that not everyone who wants to adopt a parrot has their best interest in heart, and if I end up giving him up, I'll keep in touch to make sure he's doing ok.

I found him in an abandoned house where they had left him behind in his aquarium. Most of his water had evaporated and I was shocked he was still alive.\n\nHe was the same way. He loooooved to be pet. He would follow you around in his tank. To entertain him, I would drop a ping pong ball at the top of his tank. He would drag the ball down to the bottom and let go so he could chase it back to the top! Best fish ever!\n\nEDIT: I'm so happy so many of you enjoyed hearing about Rosco! I've owned a lot of fish, but Rosco was hands down the coolest. To answer some repeated questions:\n\n1) Why the hell were you in an abandoned house??\n\n-I was dating a guy at the time that worked in construction. His company had been hired to tear the house down. He noticed the aquarium during their inspection and called me to come take a look at it to see if I was interested in it. That's when I discovered Rosco in the thick, green muck at the bottom of the tank. \n\n2) Pics please! You have to pay the pet tax. \n\n-I wish I had pictures of him! I lost a lot of photos during the breakup with the above mentioned boyfriend. Pics were on his computer, and I didn't really want to reach out to him in any way.

He quickly ate all of the little guppies I had living in there, and from that day on, the tank belonged to Rosco. He would even kill snails I put in there. He was never aggressive with me though. I had him for another 5 years. He would follow you as you moved around the room, and would float his body sidways on the top of the water so you could scratch him.

At one house shed always come by when their grandkids were visiting.  At another house she would curl up on an old lady's lap every morning.  She would stop by the big house with the giant yard near our property and kill moles for them.  The whole neighborhood was just as worried as we were and we had no idea.\n\nAfter four days one of our neighbors who had been on a trip came home and saw one of the flyers.

I think a part of it was that we had 5 people in the house who would always give her scraps and feed her when she wanted but I mean honestly my parents didn't show us how to properly raise an animal and I'll tell you why. Rat is so fucking fat her food bowl would always be full. We also had two other cats so I think that's why we kept it full and she probably just ate more than the other two combined. Also we have always had a dog and our dog eats the cat food so we've always had to keep it on the counter and the cats had to jump to it. Rat use to have no issue getting to her food. She didn't have a diet, we never fed her twice a day, the bowl was always full and on top of that she would beg for any kinds of table scraps and she would get whatever ham and cheese she wanted. My parents divorced and the family split up so now I live with my brother and we have Rat, the other cat, and the dog. Rat is now 15.5 lbs and a few months ago I took her to the vet because she was super matted in the back to be told that she's too fat to clean herself.. sadness over came me as I realized there is no hope for her, sixty dollars later I leave the vet with a half ass shaved not too cute looking Rat and news that my cat was fat, that I already knew. They advised us to put her on a diet so my brother bought her what he said, \"was like the only diet food at Walmart\" so we gave it a go. Lately we have had to clean up puke every day so today I contacted the vet. The vet told me that she could have a sensitive stomach and that could be what's causing her to throw up and to put her on a sensitive food brand the fuck I don't know. So I called mom pissed off because I'm sick of cleaning up cat puke and she told me that we should try to put her back to her old food since that's what she has always eaten and her stomach probably just isn't handling the sudden change, then she proceeded to say, \"Just give her the food she likes there's no way she's going to lose weight now she's too old.\" Stormie our other cat is super healthy, she's always outside running around and she hates human food so she doesn't beg for it. My point is please don't let your cats turn into Fat Rats because I'm looking at her as I'm typing this and she just looks so uncomfortable in skin, no wonder sleeping is the only comfortable thing for her because we let her get to this point. My dad even comes home and he says, \"Oh poor fat rat look at her she's so fat she just wants some food, you need to elevate her to her food, give her a snack.\" I also noticed the last time my dad was here her bowl was super full, she can't even jump to her food now so I dumped it!

They even break certain breeds into sub categories, as if being a purebred isn't enough. You'll see Thoroughbreds \"built for sport\" or \"built for speed\". Same with stock horses. And so many completely uncontrollable things are judged that makes it ridiculously limiting and quite unfair. Certain colors, even, are so undesirable for certain breeds you hardly see any even looked at twice by the judges. Paint colored Thoroughbreds, many painted Warmbloods (excluding Belgians, Americans, Trakehners, and Irish Sport Horses.) Even down to their markings; facial markings too big will get rejected in certain breeds (Thoroughbreds and solid colored draft horses, mostly), and in a lot of Warmbloods breeds, leg markings past the knee as well. In some you can't even register your horse in the stud book if it doesn't fit those parameters; my uncle bred Hanoverians and one of his foals had a stocking above the knee and a nearly-bald face and he was rejected entirely. \n\nThey also do it with body characteristics, like the dog ears and tails, which leads to some downright horrifying outcomes when inbreeding and lazy selective breeding comes into play. Arabians and Kathiawaris are supposed to have elegant craned necks and dished faces; Marwaris are meant to have inwardly curved ears; stock horses built for western disciplines are preferred to be stout and solid. As a result breeders take things too far and produce monsters; huge beef-wreck Quarter Horses that look like Bully Whippets, Arabians with their faces at a fucking right angle, exotic breeds with bizarre swan necks and horrible backs. \n\nI think the worst though is when dressage riders force their horses' necks all the way into their chest for that perfect dressage aesthetic. Look up 'rolkur' and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Some especially cruel people even tie their horse's head down against their chest in the stall to train them to only flex in that extremely strained figure. It's fucking sick. Those horses grow up sensitive in their mouth, gasping for air, with neck and back problems that will never be solved even if they go on total stall rest. \n\nI'll never understand why show animals are judged for things you/they can't possibly control like that.

The first two days, I did a lot of crying. Unfortunately, this also depressed my dog. So, I immediately forced myself to toughen up and be happy and encouraging around him.

Dogs really feed off your emotions and I couldn't have gotten a more stark example than this experience.\n\nA month or so later, after analyzing the growth on his amputated leg, it turned out to be cancer of the cartilage, not the bone. As cancer of the cartilage isn't nearly as aggressive and doesn't metastasize very fast, the amputation ended up curing him completely! Now he's a very happy tripawd.

Every. Damn. One. Mine was a dual purpose narc/app dog. But even the single purpose narc dogs were fucking crazy. 9 weeks of training with the dog, 5 days a week, from 8am-4pm roughly every day. Dope hides, tracking, bite work, obedience, rinse and repeat every single day....and not one dog, not mine, not the 9 other officers that were there getting certified with their dogs, not one fucking Mal was worn out at the end of the day. Ever. \n\nBurn my nose up with multiple different dope scents? Cool\nGet my adrenaline all jacked up with bite work and make me shit liquid for 5 minutes? Awesome. \nWhat's this you say? Now I have to go on a mile track through the woods in searing 90 degree heat and humidity? Yawn. \nOh now that the track is done, we gotta run a mile back to the training grounds? Lol k\nGreat we're back. Now you want me to run the agility course a dozen times? You got it.\nOh human, you took a lunch break. Cute. \n\nThese dogs are absolute machines. I handled a GSD, and he was decent, but with a working GSD, some days they just don't wanna work. They're kinda like people, they have good days and bad days. Not true with a Mal. They are turned up to MAX on the dial, 100% of the time, no matter how hard you work them. It's amazing, and they have such an awesome desire to please. I loved my work dog, he never let me down. \n\nI'm afraid they'll get over-bred and start having the litany of health issues like GSD's have, so it's important to NOT get a Mal unless you're very experienced and you are very, very active. These dogs can scale a chain link fence no matter how high it is. They'll just climb it like a ladder. If you have a wooden privacy fence, it better be 10 feet tall or higher. Oh you have an underground fence and a shock collar on your Mal? HA! You can't dial that thing up enough to stop that dog from crossing the barrier, trust me.

They can commute to food and water pretty easily and with the removal of a lot of dead trees, roosts are often the most scarce resource for bats. The best time to set up a bat house is during the \"off season\" before bats come out of hibernation and begin looking for roosts, though you can set them up anytime. It may take bats a few seasons before they figure out that they are there. If you still see no signs of occupancy by the third summer, it may be time to re-evaluate your placement and design, but if you follow these guidelines you'll have a better chance for success from the start.\n\n[Bat Conservation International has a whole section on bat houses on their website](http://www.batcon.org/resources/getting-involved/bat-houses). Most of their research is compiled in a book they publish called the [Bat House Builder's Handbook](http://www.batcon.org/pdfs/BHBuildersHdbk13_Online.pdf) that includes construction plans, placement tips, FAQs, and what bat species are likely to move in. It's a fantastic resource. They used to keep [a list of pre-assembled designs or kits that had been shown to work](http://www.batcon.org/index.php/resources/for-specific-issues/artificial-roosts/certification-vendor-list), but I'm not sure it's still well curated, but the handbook gives a good overview of what features bats seem to find desirable. There are a few basic types of designs, which are covered in the handbook, and lots of venders sell variations of those, though most will require a little TLC before being put up (caulking, painting, etc).\n\nLike any other wild animal, there probably won't be any causes for concern if you give them space. If you have a cat, they might try to catch them and bring them inside (see: [what to do if a bat enters a living space](http://www.batcon.org/index.php/resources/for-specific-issues/bats-in-buildings/there-s-a-bat-in-my-house)). Some resources recommend putting up a [predator guard or baffle](http://www.squirrelbafflestore.com/post-squirrel-baffles-c-42.html) (basically metal around a pole to prevent cats/raccoons/etc from being able to climb it) to protect the bats from predators. The noises the bats make are mostly above our hearing range and their feces is only a concern if it accumulates in a living space or in substantial amounts. Constructing bat houses won't make bats any more likely to try to live in your home. In fact, [setting up bat houses is often recommended when performing exclusions from buildings as having a new roost habitat seems to reduce the likelihood of them reentering the building.](http://www.batcon.org/resources/for-specific-issues/bats-in-buildings)\n\nThere are a few bat house designs that merge bat houses with bird nest boxes. There's also a design out there for \"bat condos\" which hold thousands of bats. There's a really impressive one on the campus of University of Florida that they set up a live stream on. There's a new design that seems promising called \"the Uncle George\" that has been shown to work better in attracting bats in [one study](http://cascadiaresearch.org/bats/BatBoxPreference_screen-view.pdf) than other designs as it more closely imitates exfoliating bark. Links to these are below:\n\n* [Here's a page on the UF bat condos (with live webcams of the colonies)](https://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/index.php/bats/home/)\n* [Combination bat house plans (including bat condo, wood duck/bat house, swift-bat house, and \"Uncle George\")](http://www.batsnorthwest.org/bat_house_central.html)\n* [Optional bat house pup catcher](http://batworld.org/bat-house-pup-catcher/)\n* [More general tips](http://www.batsnorthwest.org/bat_house_central.html)\n* [Bat Conservation and Management has a very thorough FAQ](http://batmanagement.com/Batcentral/FAQs.html) and [some tutorials](http://batmanagement.com/Batcentral/batcentral.html) and [materials for sale](http://batmanagement.com/Ordering/ordermain2.html).\n* A [study by the Nature Conservancy comparing occupancy of different bat house designs](http://cascadiaresearch.org/bats/BatBoxPreference_screen-view.pdf).\n\nGood luck!!", "id": "d12g5f5"}, {"comment": "I didn't know until now that I want to build a bat house.", "id": "d12h8de"}, {"comment": "> If you have a cat, they might try to catch them and bring them inside \n\nI read that as the bats might want to bring the cat inside, which sounded alarming.", "id": "d12m6uq"}, {"comment": "\"Sir, your cat wandered outside, please keep an eye on him so he doesn't escape again.

I had never heard of Bengals until I decided to save one from being euthanized at a shelter in Miami.

Sweetest thing ever but very vocal and energetic and although he was not mean, he made it known to my cats that I was now his. My cats were terrified of him.
