And I say social because it is what it is, depending on the environment he grows on, a kid can develop certain fetishes because \"That's what turned him on for the first time\". Of course there are a lot more factors like social pressure and whether or not people have to know about your fetish, but it's nothing more than environmental.

It's hard for a child to grow without one parental figure, but to purposefully put a child through that... Even if society was universally accepting of that idea, and ignoring the familiar environment in which the child grows, children will inevitably make him go through hell throughout his childhood, it's just the way they are.\n\nAnd the food is a perfect example, since (mostly) enjoying certain foods depends on the environment regarding your first experiences with them.

We know that human actions/reactions are not random and follow correlations. If you hug a crying child it will feel comfort and stop and if a child feels uncomfortable (say from a nightmare?) it may cry to receive comfort. \n\nSecondly, also assume that animal behavior isn't all programmed genetics, we know this is true (mostly) because we have direct evidence of animals learning behavior that makes up their personality. For instance, pods of whales have their own dialect. We know that elephants stop at grave yards to mourn for their dead relatives and we know that when an elephant hears the voice of tourists it doesn't feel fear because it knows what poachers sound like and upon hearing poachers an elephants will crowd together defensively with their children in the center of a group. \n\n\nSo, can we assume the skunk knew that a human helped him? \n\nPossibly, but it also might have just been very confused. There simply isn't enough info on the skunk. It may be completely comfortable around humans because they have never harmed it, or may even offer it food. In this snapshot it's difficult to read into that animals behavior because often animal behavior is informed by past experience (refer back to elephants). \n\n\nBut in general can we assume animals think and feel? Absolutely, and we are hard pressed to find animals that don't feel emotions on a basic level. \n\nThis is an uncomfortable fact for most people because you don't have to look hard to find animals that we mistreat en masse. We know pigs are remarkably smart animals and they're treated incredibly poorly, same thing with cows, and the treatment of primates, even in some of the best conditions, leaves something to be desired.

Growing up in a poor area of Chicago allowed you to see first hand affects and consequences of this drug which kept most my friends away from it. Now it seems kids aren't going out and playing as much and find themselves \"bored\" looking for other ways to fill their time. Whether looking in their parents liquor cabinet or pill cabinet to buying Coricidin Cough and Cold to get fucked up. I've also seen the occasional white male with back problems going into the worst parts of Chicago just to get a fix as a replacement to pain pills. Everyone has their story but I think this false war on drugs, legalization of weed is promoting these cartels and other \"bad guys\" to focus all their \"marketing\" skills to heroin.

This was pretty fucking traumatizing for the youngster I was. This wasn't a one time thing either, he would *constantly* do it. Even now, I'm weary about closet. It's silly, cause I know he's not in there, *but just in case.* \n\nIt wasn't exclusive to closets either. No it was also under beds, drawers, and the shed. No fucking joke, he even took the time to take everything out of the fridge, just to jump out at me. There was even a time where I almost crashed the car because he jumped out of the backseat.

It's enough to give anyone cardiac arrest.\n\nHe was an absolute ass. \n\nMy girl friend at the time (I believe I was 16?) wanted to come over. I was hesitant, because I didn't want my dad scaring her. I called him, and told me I was bring over my girlfriend, and told him not to do any pranks on her. He agreed, but I knew he had something in mind. \n\nI drive back to  my house and get ready for whatever the hell my dad was going to pull. I noticed that his car wasn't there, and that he might've gone shopping for groceries, since it was his turn to make dinner. Still, I was on my guard, ready for something stupid to happen.\n\nMy girlfriend and I went into my room to hangout and watch some T.V. She said she was hoping to meet my parents, but I told her they'll probably be gone for a bit. She took this as a green light to do the dirty. She told me she was feeling a little excited from being in my room. She started to straddle me, and we started to casually make out. She started to take off her top, but then I noticed the closer door raddled for a moment. \n\n\"*Oh hell no.*\" I thought to myself.\n\nI stopped my girlfriend for a moment, and told her to give me a second. I swung the closet door open, and to my surprise, I didn't see anyone in there. I doubled checked behind clothing, and nothing was there. I get back to my girlfriend, and she asked if anything was wrong, I told her no. We went back to what we started.\n\nKissing her neck gently, going further, and further down her body.

Once you have your General/Master Falconer's blessing after having spent time learning the sport and showing your commitment, and you have all the legal requirements fulfilled, then you are permitted to take a first year ('passage') red-tailed hawk or American kestrel (red-tails are the most common starter birds).  And thus begins your working relationship with birds of prey.  I think you will be considered an Apprentice for at least 2 years.

But when I was young, my mom would call me upstairs to clean my room or something, and while I trot my way up the stairs, he would jump out of the closet to scare the shit out of me. This was pretty fucking traumatizing for the youngster I was. This wasn't a one time thing either, he would *constantly* do it. Even now, I'm weary about closet. It's silly, cause I know he's not in there, *but just in case.* \n\nIt wasn't exclusive to closets either. No it was also under beds, drawers, and the shed. No fucking joke, he even took the time to take everything out of the fridge, just to jump out at me. There was even a time where I almost crashed the car because he jumped out of the backseat. Have you ever seen a six foot, 200+ pound man jump out at you? It's enough to give anyone cardiac arrest.\n\nHe was an absolute ass. \n\nMy girl friend at the time (I believe I was 16?) wanted to come over. I was hesitant, because I didn't want my dad scaring her. I called him, and told me I was bring over my girlfriend, and told him not to do any pranks on her. He agreed, but I knew he had something in mind. \n\nI drive back to  my house and get ready for whatever the hell my dad was going to pull. I noticed that his car wasn't there, and that he might've gone shopping for groceries, since it was his turn to make dinner. Still, I was on my guard, ready for something stupid to happen.\n\nMy girlfriend and I went into my room to hangout and watch some T.V. She said she was hoping to meet my parents, but I told her they'll probably be gone for a bit. She took this as a green light to do the dirty. She told me she was feeling a little excited from being in my room. She started to straddle me, and we started to casually make out. She started to take off her top, but then I noticed the closer door raddled for a moment. \n\n\"*Oh hell no.*\" I thought to myself.\n\nI stopped my girlfriend for a moment, and told her to give me a second. I swung the closet door open, and to my surprise, I didn't see anyone in there. I doubled checked behind clothing, and nothing was there. I get back to my girlfriend, and she asked if anything was wrong, I told her no. We went back to what we started.\n\nKissing her neck gently, going further, and further down her body. I finally got to undoing her pants. I took a quick second to make sure my dad wasn't under the bed or anything. But finally, when I pulled down her underwear, I heard my bedroom door open. Guess who came walking in to the room?\n\nYou fucking guessed it. It was my girlfriend. I was confused, and stared at her in awe for a moment. I turn back around and see a giant dick waving in front of me. I look back up and who I thought was my girlfriend takes off her wig.\n\nIt was my fucking dad. My girlfriend and my dad were just laughing the whole time.\n\n\"Goddamnit dad!\" I yelled. \"This is the fucking third time you've done this.\"\n\nMy girlfriend was in on the prank the whole time. After awhile though, I could't help but laugh.\n\nI know my dad loves me, that's why he does these silly pranks on me all the time.

Obviously pushing a rider off track is not something that is allowed and Rossi deserved a penalty, but many feel starting from the back and effectively eliminating his chances at the championship was a bit harsh.\n\nHonestly, the worst thing about it was the childishness of Lorenzo (rider in this GIF) reacting to the penalty on Rossi - Lorenzo wasn't at all involved in the incident, but got heated and tried to push for a higher penalty on Rossi. To me that comes across as very poor sportsmanship, wanting to win on paper and penalties rather than earning it on the track. \n\nMarquez lost even more fans though, including myself, because he got himself involved in the championship despite not being a contender by trying to aid Lorenzo (by slowing down Rossi) - likely because they're both Spanish and Rossi is Italian, and Marquez had crashed in the early part of the season trying a poorly thought out pass on Rossi and he was probably still salty about that.

The extreme Left and Right voted and the Electoral college sucks. We need to listen to Rural America more but voting in Trump seems like a Mistake because he has no idea was he is doing and is a liar. His policies were too extreme and most people don't agree with them. Most of America is actually \"middle\" or Moderate. They are just too busy, don't care, or don't see a point in voting. To help the middle Class, and rural America, we need to give them Higher Education so when automation, globalization, and unforeseen events, takes jobs they are able to educate themselves into a better job. Free college, Taxes on the top 10% (that work) would all help America be \"great again\" because we would be able to afford to fix and educate everyone if the Rich paid their fair share. It is like 34 trillion dollars were avoided in 2012, imagine how much they have saved and avoided paying in 4 years. They would more then double be able to pay off every government program and still have money left over. Two as the world advances humans aren't needed because machines will replace us. Even with cheap labor it is cheaper to have a machine replace humans because they are better. They are faster, they are stronger, they never tire. Machine will replace many jobs, and the way to combat this is to educate people. And we can give everyone Education with taxing the right people the right amount. Also having the government not pass anything in over 500 vetos to President Obama to help America didn't help. That is over 6 years he would try to pass something and The house and Senate would vote everything, and anything. That kind of action makes America stagnant. If America doesn't move forward with Technology and Education the rest of the world will leave America behind. Another thing is that the news media didn't tell the truth. It made people vote one way or another, or that they shouldn't vote because Hilary was so far ahead in the polls I don't need to vote.

Marriage is the proper Remedy. It is the most natural State of Man, and therefore the State in which you are most likely to find solid Happiness. Your Reasons against entering into it at present, appear to me not well-founded. The circumstantial Advantages you have in View by postponing it, are not only uncertain, but they are small in comparison with that of the Thing itself, the being married and settled. It is the Man and Woman united that make the compleat human Being. Separate, she wants his Force of Body and Strength of Reason; he, her Softness, Sensibility and acute Discernment. Together they are more likely to succeed in the World. A single Man has not nearly the Value he would have in that State of Union. He is an incomplete Animal. He resembles the odd Half of a Pair of Scissars. If you get a prudent healthy Wife, your Industry in your Profession, with her good Economy, will be a Fortune sufficient.\n\nBut if you will not take this Counsel, and persist in thinking a Commerce with the Sex inevitable, then I repeat my former Advice, that in all your Amours you should prefer old Women to young ones. You call this a Paradox, and demand my Reasons. They are these:\n\ni. Because as they have more Knowledge of the World and their Minds are better stor'd with Observations, their Conversation is more improving and more lastingly agreable.\n\n2. Because when Women cease to be handsome, they study to be good. To maintain their Influence over Men, they supply the Diminution of Beauty by an Augmentation of Utility. They learn to do a 1000 Services small and great, and are the most tender and useful of all Friends when you are sick. Thus they continue amiable. And hence there is hardly such a thing to be found as an old Woman who is not a good Woman.\n\n3. Because there is no hazard of Children, which irregularly produc'd may be attended with much Inconvenience.\n\n4. Because thro' more Experience, they are more prudent and discreet in conducting an Intrigue to prevent Suspicion. The Commerce with them is therefore safer with regard to your Reputation. And with regard to theirs, if the Affair should happen to be known, considerate People might be rather inclin'd to excuse an old Woman who would kindly take care of a young Man, form his Manners by her good Counsels, and prevent his ruining his Health and Fortune among mercenary Prostitutes.\n\n5. Because in every Animal that walks upright, the Deficiency of the Fluids that fill the Muscles appears first in the highest Part: The Face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the Neck; then the Breast and Arms; the lower Parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a Basket, and regarding only what is below the Girdle, it is impossible of two Women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all Cats are grey, the Pleasure of corporal Enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every Knack being by Practice capable of Improvement.\n\n6. Because the Sin is less. The debauching a Virgin may be her Ruin, and make her for Life unhappy.\n\n7. Because the Compunction is less. The having made a young Girl miserable may give you frequent bitter Reflections; none of which can attend the making an old Woman happy.\n\n8thly and Lastly They are so grateful!!\n\nThus much for my Paradox. But still I advise you to marry directly; being sincerely Your affectionate Friend.", "id": "d8ldrck"}, {"comment": "Here's the thing", "id": "d8lh00o"}, {"comment": "[Grab Her Right In The Pussy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIQguao8Gfw#t=0m05)", "id": "d8lrnz3"}, {"comment": "Old chicken makes good soup.", "id": "d8ldt9l"}, {"comment": "You can tell by the neck and everything else.", "id": "d8l6a1x"}], [{"comment": "The hell is he drinking, antifreeze?", "id": "d8l67lb"}, {"comment": "Maybe absinthe or lime kool-aid", "id": "d8l710z"}, {"comment": "Gatorade in a glass (who the fuck does that?)", "id": "d8lb29w"}, {"comment": "Already been answered, but it's a diabolo menthe (mint syrup with lemonade).

Loved the dog with my life. He was a really good dog for the family, but ,unfortunately, he was vicious with strangers. It took forever to introduce him to new family members because he'd be whoopin and hollerin. We'd know every single morning when the meter guy came around cause our dog (His name was Picasso) would go nuts. Great guard dog. \n\nMe and my brother would play rough with hin and he would get aggressive with us but he never went overboard. Of course he bit us before or scratched us, but never went for our neck or faces, and we totally were asking for it. He was always calm after and loved us as much as we loved him. Never bit my mom or dad once. \n\nAnyway, one day when I was probably 10 or 11 Picasso was out in the yard. We had a large, open yard, so we would tie Picasso up near our house and he had a lot of room to run around. He loved it outside. \n\nAnyway, he's outside chilling, and a couple yards over is this Chinese restaurant. And of course, the owner would let his 6 year old kid just roam around and do whatever he wants. Plenty of times this kid Daniel would roam into our yard and we'd either shoo him away or he'd get scared by the insane barking white dog, but this time, no, he thinks it'd be fun to see what dog does. So he starts walking towards Picasso and Pico is just going nuts by this point. We hear him and get up and by the time we get to the door he was a few feet away. As we open the door we start yelling at this kid Daniel to GTFO like crazy but it didn't work. Daniel stepped towards Pico and Pico did what he was supposed to do, he protected us from strangers haha, and scratched this kids chest badly and bit his arm. \n\nWe managed to pull off Pico before Daniel was probably killed. Cops were called, and his father finally came out. Guess what happened. \n\nNothing. Cops explained to Daniel's dad that the dog was provoked by trespassing into the yard, the dog was leashed, and there was no adult present. Daniel's dad just kinda rushed out of there after that, and that was it. \n\nPico lived to see another day and he kept being a crazy, beautiful, loving dog. So many stories of that crazy dog, but he lived till 14 and I'm pretty sure he beat cancer once. What finally stopped him was an ear tumor that went into his brain. Damn good dog. Miss you Pico.

Loved the dog with my life. He was a really good dog for the family, but ,unfortunately, he was vicious with strangers. It took forever to introduce him to new family members because he'd be whoopin and hollerin. We'd know every single morning when the meter guy came around cause our dog (His name was Picasso) would go nuts. Great guard dog. \n\nMe and my brother would play rough with hin and he would get aggressive with us but he never went overboard. Of course he bit us before or scratched us, but never went for our neck or faces, and we totally were asking for it. He was always calm after and loved us as much as we loved him. Never bit my mom or dad once. \n\nAnyway, one day when I was probably 10 or 11 Picasso was out in the yard. We had a large, open yard, so we would tie Picasso up near our house and he had a lot of room to run around. He loved it outside. \n\nAnyway, he's outside chilling, and a couple yards over is this Chinese restaurant. And of course, the owner would let his 6 year old kid just roam around and do whatever he wants. Plenty of times this kid Daniel would roam into our yard and we'd either shoo him away or he'd get scared by the insane barking white dog, but this time, no, he thinks it'd be fun to see what dog does. So he starts walking towards Picasso and Pico is just going nuts by this point. We hear him and get up and by the time we get to the door he was a few feet away. As we open the door we start yelling at this kid Daniel to GTFO like crazy but it didn't work. Daniel stepped towards Pico and Pico did what he was supposed to do, he protected us from strangers haha, and scratched this kids chest badly and bit his arm. \n\nWe managed to pull off Pico before Daniel was probably killed. Cops were called, and his father finally came out. Guess what happened. \n\nNothing. Cops explained to Daniel's dad that the dog was provoked by trespassing into the yard, the dog was leashed, and there was no adult present. Daniel's dad just kinda rushed out of there after that, and that was it. \n\nPico lived to see another day and he kept being a crazy, beautiful, loving dog. So many stories of that crazy dog, but he lived till 14 and I'm pretty sure he beat cancer once. What finally stopped him was an ear tumor that went into his brain. Damn good dog. Miss you Pico.

Ladened is a word that appears in the book a bunch of times.\n\nLadened kind of bastardizes the adjective into having the appearance of a past tense verb, but the past tense for \"lade\" would properly be \"laden\" or less commonly as \"laded\". \"Unladened\", is not really an accurate word. Unladen is to be described as being not laden. \"Unladened\" would imply that there was an action that took place to undo being laden. It's a clunky solution to a sentence and it slightly changes the meaning and doesn't fit very snugly.\n\nThe way it's used here is as an adjective to describe the state of a noun in the present tense. It follows that \"ladened\" and \"unladened\" would be incongruent with the intended meaning and better replaced with \"laden\" and \"unladen\".\n\nDespite any of this nonsense, the original scene uses \"unladen.\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/y2R3FvS4xr4", "id": "d39o3ew"}, {"comment": "Unsubscribe ", "id": "d39t3tx"}, {"comment": "Thank you for subscribing to Droll Facts.

It wouldn't simply be a matter of loading them up right from the factory because cars are generally thoroughly tested right off the production line to make sure they aren't DOA. So you'd have to drain everything out and throw away all those fluids used for testing, plus having a running car makes putting them on and taking them off the train car *much* easier. Then once it got to the destination you'd have to refill everything and bleed the systems rather than just driving them onto the lot.

Calling them cowards just seems absurd and gratuitous.\n\nAlright, I get your point. The act itself may not be cowardly, granted. But the reason we call those hijackers cowards is not for their acts, so much as for their motives and tactics. In war, a sniper could be considered the modern embodiment of a coward, and it'd be a fair point, because he's doing everything he can to avoid going face-to-face with danger. Regardless of whether it's *smarter* ^(it is, of course) , it's definitely less *courageous* than assaulting your enemy bare-handed. \n\nSame for the motives of the hijackers: instead of dealing with their societal problems; instead of studying their Qu'ran and deciding that maybe they should relinquish their religion's hate and violence; *instead of even killing soldiers* with IED; instead of improving the shithole that they call a nation; they decided to deliberately attack civilians, the weaker, to pursue their goals. Note, that I include a violent alternative, which is also considered 'cowardly' of course, but less so. What's going to take more courage when you're an indoctrinated terrorist? Giving in to peer pressure and blowing yourself/some others up? Or leaving, telling your peers/superiors that you disagree with their ideology of violence? I know, both are rather unthinkable, but I bet the latter is hardest, as it always is in such situations.\n\n>isn't someone who wouldn't even dare to do that for fear of the consequences (even though they want the loot and don't care about the victim) more of a coward?\n\n...

Every once in a while I chuck a little raw meat nibblet to a magpie. Why? Because they see me as a friend (or at least someone to tolerate) and don't swoop me during breeding season.\n\nHorses are oddly enough the same. The next time you see a horse in a field, stroll up to the fence and just ignore the big bugger. It may take a while but eventually the horse will wander over and watch you. Keep ignoring them. Ignore them until they nudge you and then you walk away. They'll whinny, I can almost guarantee it.\n\n\"Hey, Ass-hole, you can't ignore me!\"\n\nI have gotten on quite well with a number of different animals simply by paying them no attention until *they* demanded it.\n\nThe reason is pretty simple, or at least how I see it. Every critter on this planet is primarily driven by it's needs to eat, sleep, and procreate. Higher levels of intelligence introduce such urges like socialising and expanding the \"family\" herd or group to other animals which don't pose an immediate threat.\n\nSo if you ignore other animals they get the idea you're not a predator. You *might* be someone who could benefit them.\n\nAnd who doesn't love a chin scratch or a belly rub or being fed?\n\nI would not recommend anyone try this with predatory animals though.\n\nEdit: Oh, I just remembered. This is why people who are allergic or afraid of cats seem to attract them. The cat knows the bipedal critter is as about as skittish as a mouse, but has warmth and space and possible belly rubs.", "id": "d04fb9f"}, {"comment": "I read that in joe Pesci's voice", "id": "d047tg6"}], [{"comment": "That owl sucks at playing fetch.", "id": "d040224"}, {"comment": "He's pretty fucking great at \"hey, here's that shit you just threw over here.

What's hilarious to me is that everyone says that these feral dogs can raise their litters all fine blablabla yet they don't know how large the litter started and how many survived to adulthood I'm sure a puppy or two died along the way. What doesn't really matter anyway because I wasn't talking about a feral dog. If this person is a breeder and chooses to sell these puppies I would see that dog house and walk right away chances are they won't be properly socialized and they'll have separation anxiety way harder they can hop out and eat grass if they wanted(More chances of parasites) and there's still the fact that when the moms sleeping she can maybe 1/50 litters crush a puppy. That's why I said if the owner wants to be \"EXTRA SAFE\". Now the cat could be deflead and vaccinated and have all sorts of protection and still pass stuff along to the puppies they're not vaccinated for every little thing.

Kids fall behind when they're not in class, and there's a substantial body of research demonstrating that point. It's also worth noting that, as in most countries, [U.S. children have an explicit right to an education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_education).\n\nBut the question I had was \"is this even a thing you could enforce\", and the answer seems to be no. I'm going to use Maryland as an example (I was a teacher here once), but while these laws do change on a state by state basis all states will have restrictions on who can be suspended/expelled and when.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStarting from the state statutes, [the power to expel a student rests with the superintendent](https://web.archive.org/web/20141025094633/http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2014RS/Statute_Web/ged/ged.pdf) (.pdf warning and an awkward link, but all of the relevant information is in section \u00a77\u2013305). This means that any removal from class lasting 10 days or more falls exclusively to that position. Superintendents are elected, and it's in their best interest to avoid the media-storm that comes with doubling or tripling expulsion rates. Further, students expelled from one school still have a right to an education. They'll often move to another location where this lengthy and expensive process would start anew. Either way, a principal is never in a position to enforce a rule that threatens expulsion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo we step back and try suspension. This lets us remove the student from class for up to 10 days, and can be done by the principal (which makes this a school-wide effort, in line with the scope of the original article). Unfortunately for us in this hypothetical situation, the rules surrounding suspension in state law are also impacted by those enforced at the county level. Pulling from [Montgomery County legislation](http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/policy/pdf/jgarb.pdf) (an area with a demographic profile that makes a high anti-vaccination population likely), \n\n> Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) disciplinary process shall\u2014...\n\n> ...use long-term suspensions or expulsions only last resort options...\"\n\nContinuing down this vein, our harshest potential penalty would be a short-term suspension (up to three school days).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur original letter now reads as follow...\n\n\"Unless you have a letter from a doctor saying there's a medical reason your child cannot be vaccinated, they must be vaccinated. Otherwise, they will be suspended for three days.\"\n\nWhich is of course silly, but that's the point I'm trying to make. Unless there is an established reason for the removal of a student from school in the United States, or unless there are clear legal grounds for that power to fall to the discretion of the acting party, students cannot simply be removed. Best case scenario you're asking for a lengthy court case (lawyers can be involved in any part of a suspension/expulsion meeting, and there's absolutely an argument to be made that this policy goes beyond a principal's realm of power), worst case scenario you're asking to be fired.\n\n---\n**TL;DR** Schools in the United States don't generally have the power to remove students from school, even if we believe their position on vaccination poses a threat to other children.", "id": "d6xb47c"}, {"comment": "Which Montgomery County?

It was a SUPER chill place.   Everyone was exceptionally laid back, and there was no drama.   Well the pod watched that episode when it aired , and maybe 5 mins later one of the black guys screamed  WHITE POWER!!!!!     Exactly the way they did in the episode.  Well a few mins later EVERYONE is yelling it.\n\nWHITE POWER!!!!   Became the standard greeting and goodbye of our pod,   If someone was leaving or coming back in,  it was guaranteed they would stand at the door raise a fist and scream it.\n\nFast forward a month or 2 down the road and I am getting shipped out,  back to Cincinnati.   At like 4 am,  via a prisoner transport company,   Transcor.\nWell they get me out of my cell,  then proceeded to  walk me to the door.   At the door I turned around raised a fist and yelled at the top of my lungs....   WHITE POWER!\nThe head Sheriff is one of the people taking me out and he turns and looks at me,  I point and at the windows of most every cell is a body staring back at me and the screams start.\nThe head Sheriff just stares in disbelief as 2 young black dudes and 2 mexicans are repeatedly screaming WHITE POWER,   fists in the air and everything.  Then the white guys join in.  Its 4 AM and it sounds like a Klan rally in there.\n\nThe Sheriff there was a humorous laid back guy, in his mid 50's and relatively distinguished looking.  Well I thought he was going to have an aneurysm at this point.  He goes beet red and starts shaking.  Im standing there with another C.O and both of us are just waiting for the explosion.    Then this gut busting HAWWW comes slipping out of the guy, and there is this head sheriff practically rolling around on the floor just busting a gut laughing, the poor guy is practically crying.\n\n\nThey lead me out,  and of course they pepper me with questions.  And my response is still talked about in that town to this day.  \n\n\n\"We are an equal opportunity hate group,  We will take anyone as long as it furthers the white agenda\"\n\n\nWhats the white agenda?\n\n\n\"Fuck wheat bread!

There are a few legitimate (and more than illegitimate, which should be easy to distinguish) articles floating around on it... back when we were tribal and before major trade, those who were different from us likely weren't visiting to say hey, but rather to kill us for hunting grounds and access to water. The gut reaction was fear or hostility. As humanity expanded and formed more advanced cultures, so did this idea in a more \"refined\" fashion (barbarians, etc.). However, in this day and age, most people (particularly in urban environments) are exposed to any number of cultures and peoples, as well as ideas of multiculturalism, so the \"threat\" is mostly nullified except is isolated, homogeneous communities that become echo chambers for rhetoric building off of this feeling... or societies that classify different races as \"alien\" to the point that they no longer resemble the \"true\" citizens, for some other purpose (generally political). On the latter, think Japan towards non-ethnic Japanese, the US towards Latino immigrants, or some of western Europe's response to Eastern European workers.\n\nOf course, racism became a \"science\" starting in the age of exploration for justification of any number of awful things, but some people think it's just an extension of that initial, uncomfortable awareness of \"the other\" from our early days. \n\nBut I'm no scientist, just an amateur cultural theorist, so take that as you will.", "id": "dam06ba"}, {"comment": "Racism isn't something unique it's all part of the same thing.

We feel more connected to a tragedy the more we identify with it. If the tragedy is in a culture totally foreign to you, it's not possible to feel as empathetic to them as you would otherwise. \n\nWhen we recognise ourselves in something then we feel much more personally connected to whatever it is.

She would just hang on the goofy bastards neck ( his thick coat and huge mass made her more of a nuisance than anything )\n\n2. Took on a small car, my dad was walking her on the Fourth of July and she got off leash, we found her a little shook up, but with an obvious tire track down her back.\n\n3. We moved to a farm so she would have more room, she got out when she saw the combine coming. All I could do was cry \"Nooooo!\" But somehow she came out the other end, mad as hell!\n\n4. Got raccoons in the barn, anyone who knows raccoons knows they should be able to easily take on, or get away from a 20lb dog. Nope. With her partner Newton they got the mom raccoon defending her babies, and all the babies :(\n\n5. We got rats in the old farm house, they were huge. They liked to get on the counter and open the butter dish and eat the butter. In the middle of the night my dad got up to get a drink of water, sparky groggily followed. My dad saw the rat, and like lightning he got the dog on the counter. It was a blink of an eye and the rat was playing a harp.\n\nYes Jack Russells are super cute, but if you think about it they have the most wolf like characteristics bred back into them. They hunt on their own, and without human guidance. They are great dogs but they have crazy in them. Some are a little better, Newton was pretty calm and easy to train but sparky was a garbage eating escape artist. If you told her no, she wouldn't skulk off, she would get angry. She had serious anger issues. She is still alive but a bit geriatric at 14 years old, but I don't think she would think twice about going after that raccoon again.\n\nJust so everyone knows, I did not condone any of these things happening (besides the rat) they were out of my control, I would do anything to protect sparky. And now that I moved out I miss her badass no fucks attitude. But before anyone considers adopting a Jack Russell/parson russel/rat terrier they need to know that these dogs were made to hunt vermin, they need loads of attention, and good fences, room to run, and to be socialized early.

Even their positions on the roost bars are more or less interchangeable. It's really only a big deal if #50 tries to take #3's spot, or some similarly massive leap.\n\nHope that makes sense. Random anecdote time: two Araucana hens I had the privilege of raising seemed to actually become friends. I saw those two hanging out all the time, roaming over a five acre farm always by one another's side. They even had a special meeting spot by a barn door entrance where they'd begin the day together; one hen was faster than the other, so when the coop door opened up in the morning she'd race to their spot and just wait there until the other caught up, at which point they'd both begin the day's foraging. I kept thinking for sure it was just a fluke, but the same interaction kept playing out day after day. Hen 1 genuinely seemed adverse to going out foraging before Hen 2 had caught up.\n\n...unfortunately, this story doesn't have a happy ending. One of the hens was nabbed by a fox one autumn, and I swear to you, the other hen noticed she was gone. I heard a unique squawking I'd never heard before coming from their meeting place at the barn, and sure enough, it was one of the two friends standing there squawking at the top of her lungs, the other hen nowhere to be seen.

Observation of male wolves dominating other male wolves in packs almost always turns out to be the parent wolf getting ready to chase off a maturing male offspring who's ready to go form his own pack and is similar to other parent canines disciplining their offspring.

Just watched me from a rock on a shelf with a heat lamp above it. But on the second day, out of nowhere, the damn lizard bum rushes me as I'm stepping over the gate. \n\nI fall backwards into the hallway, and put a hole in the wall with my elbow. The iguana meanwhile climbs over the gate, and lands on me. I repeatedly push it off and away as I'm trying to get up. It scratches the shit out of my arms and legs in the process. Once I make it to my feet, I head for the living room, bleeding. The iguana chases me down the hall. I'm not sure of this, but I think it was hissing? \n\nAnyhow, I made it out the front door, slam it shut behind me. Leave the fucking beastie to its own devices. I went to urgent care, got myself checked out and bandaged and a course of antibiotics for a week or so.\n\nCalled my buddy when I got home, and told him what happened.

With respect to the DMCA, the host is only negligent if they were notified of the offending context but didn't remove it in a reasonable period of time. \n\nIt's a long-shot, but the 20 seconds it takes to edit an image is probably worth the trouble just to be safe and stay off of the admin's shitlist. I'm sure Reddit would be a much more desirable target for a lawsuit compared to the type of person who harasses strangers online. Plus it could also jeopardize Reddit's relationship with its sponsors for this sort of harassment. In the end, it's a lot easier for Reddit to issue summary shadowbans than deal with a lawsuit. \n\nIn any case, my original comment wasn't to disagree with the other user. What they said is true of many subs. When I first read the comment, its karma was around -10 and no one had said anything about why they were downvoting it, so I figured it'd offer a potential reason. Personally, if I'm wrong about something or for some other reason my post or comment gets downvoted, I definitely appreciate it when people point out the mistake or otherwise offer a reason for downvoting. I don't give a shit about karma; I'd just prefer not to repeatedly piss people off due to ignorance on my part.\n\nThis went a bit longer than I intended, but thanks for mentioning it and giving me an opportunity to clarify what I meant.", "id": "d1kadvx"}, {"comment": "Because, like a lot of other people, my public twitter username is my actual name and my reddit username is anonymous.

He then called the police and waited for them to show up.\n\nThe catch was that it was a refrigerated trailer.\n\nWhen the police showed up, they were pretty concerned that it was a refrigerated trailer (they warned him never to lock people in his trailer again), but arrested the three individuals who (due to the cold) could barely talk after spending about 35 minutes in there, and my dad went on his merry way.\n\nThey spent the first 25 minutes banging on the door and yelling in Spanish and English.

This would vary from place to place, but I would say entering the truck, added with frantically grabbing the stuff and tucking it to his stomach would probably be enough if this was real. Not something I would let my guys get away with, but if push came to shove, I would almost bet prosecution would be likely.\n\nGenerally we always made them exit because it was corporate policy for a couple reasons. First, you want to be absolutely certain you have enough to get the prosecuted, and there is a decent gap of time between you leaving the camera room and running out to apprehend them. There is always the chance that they ditch the item before leaving the store and then an apprehension where they don't have anything on their person would have you in deep shit. So making sure you have video evidence of a theft from beginning to end.\n\nInterestingly enough, or probably not to anyone else, the rules for an LP apprehension at most large chains are really strict. For example, at one chain I won't name, you actually have to witness the person enter the department, pick up the item, conceal the item, and then exit the store with it, all with unbroken sight of the suspect. And then you have to apprehend them before they get 15 feet away from the store. If someone conceals an item and then say enters a bathroom or something, it's corporate policy to try for a recovery (scaring them into ditching the item by saying something over the intercome that makes it seem like you're watching them) and let them go without engaging because there's a small chance they could ditch the item in the bathroom and then you have a potential lawsuit on your hands. And, it takes something like 42 shoplifting incidents to amount to what the average dishonest employee costs a company over the course of a year. Except for gypsies, those fuckers will hit you for half the store in like 5 minutes and you'll never even notice they were there. Over 60% of retail shrink is internal though.\n\nAlso, the best time to steal is on Black Friday, because most department stores have loss prevention handling other things and it's too crowded to confidently apprehend someone without incident, even opening the doors safely takes insane coordination and practice. When I started as an LP manager I spent Black Fridays doing cash pickups because the registers got too full and preparing for the bank drop because, instead of hiring a Brinks truck, the company I worked for just shoved like two hundred grand into bags and made me drive it to the bank after close.", "id": "d9xko9e"}, {"comment": "This is a legitimate question and whoever downvoted it is an idiot who has no idea what a downvote is for.", "id": "d9xittp"}, {"comment": "Entrapment isn't the same as locking someone in your truck when they try to rob you. \n\n*In criminal law, entrapment is a practice whereby a law enforcement agent induces a person to commit a criminal offense that the person would have otherwise been unlikely to commit*\n\nLeaving the back of a truck open is not an inducement as nobody is telling you to be a thieving bastard.", "id": "d9xk47x"}, {"comment": "Had to go down far for this one.

When push came to shove, Walmart chose cheap labor that was morally questionable. Same with the auto industry, same with Nike, whatever. \n\nBut this is the problem. To the vast majority of people this just isn't an acceptable excuse. It amounts to \"everyone else does it\". We're just as angry at Walmart, Nike, whatever. It's all part of a corporate profit-chasing culture that's deeply disturbing to a lot of us.\n\nThere's a moral side to any business decision, but apparently the biggest firms just forego that part, presuming money is the bottom line of everything. Say your neighbor starts up a small business and flagrantly takes advantage of the elderly by, for instance, offering them loans at massively inflated rates because they don't know better. He specifically targets low-information customers and drives them to desperation and bankruptcy if they can't pay. You wouldn't be okay with that, right? Even though he's only chasing profit there's something very unsettling with completely neglecting all ethical responsibility just for money.\n\nOf course there's fault with whichever regulator allowed it to happen too, but the major share of the blame should lie with whoever neglected their moral responsibility to society by chasing profits. When the general public sees something like this on such a large scale that it's excused by \"everyone else does it\" they understandably get enraged, especially when they're the people being taken advantage of, they're the ones who had to pay the bailout, they're the ones who had to foreclose on their homes.\n\nAbsolving the financial industry of guilt for 2008 misses the point entirely, if you ask me.", "id": "d301dkq"}, {"comment": "See I absolutely agree with your example, but the fact of a corporation isn't as simple as the neighbor example just blown up several thousand fold.

For him he was involved in every aspect of the fraud. For them, every single employee has a hand to play in what amounts to a very negative outcome but no one does very much. They are essentially doing their jobs. In my eyes as an analyst, you read algorithms that predict market outcomes, then you pass that information on. That information carries with it the inherent knowledge that people are going to lose a lot of money, but for you personally you are just compiling a report and doing your job. The higher ups read that message and schedule a meeting or send an email, continuing to convey that information up the food chain. There is no one person responsible for dumping stock either when things go bad, they have entire floors of traders who do it, each doing a small part to contribute to a massively negative outcome.

I doubt that is the actual number, but why that many zeroes? ", "id": "d7bqiiv"}, {"comment": "It is the actual number, and here's some rough logic to why it ends in that many zeroes:\n\nSo a deck of 52 cards has 52! different ways it can be arranged (that's pronounced \"Fifty-two factorial\" and not an exuberantly shouted \"Fifty-two\"). The \"!\" symbol means that you multiply that number by each of the whole numbers smaller than it, all the way down to one. So, 5! would be 5\\*4\\*3\\*2\\*1, or 120. 6! is 720. As you can see, the size of a factorial number grows dramatically and quickly.\n\nBut you don't HAVE to arrange them in descending order, the commutative property says the order to multiply doesn't matter. So instead (to get back to your original question) let's try to pull out all the tens from 52!. There's 10, then there's 20 (2\\*10), 30, 40, and 50. That's five 10's right there which will be multiplied by everything else, so you are already guaranteeing that the number ends in 5 zeroes. Now let's pull out pairs of 2's and 5's (since they are the prime factors of 10). Since there are more 2's than 5's, you are going to be capped on the 5's. So let's count the 5's (make sure you don't double count the 10's you already pulled out! There's 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45. Each of those can be paired with a 2 to make five more tens. So now we are up to ten tens, which means the number will end in at least 10 zeroes. So where do the other two come from? Well, there are two more 5's that we skipped. 25 has an extra five and we only counted one. 50 has a five AND a ten but we only counted the ten. Thus, 52! will end in 12 zeroes. Because of how multiplication works, big factorial numbers will always end in lots of zeroes.\n\nDid this make sense?", "id": "d7bspsi"}, {"comment": "I know how factorials work, but nice job, that makes perfect sense. \n\nLike, I'm almost speechless.

There are 6 sides that can be face up and 4 orientations once you've picked a side to be face up.\n\nSo you end up with 8!\\*3^8 /(3\\*6\\*4)=3,674,160\n\nFor a 3x3x3 it is similar, except you must also consider the 12 sides each with 2 orientations.

That number is 20, and this was arrived at after considerable math and eventually fucking brute-forcing the problem using Google's server farm (they solved in simulation EVERY POSSIBLE ITERATION of the cube).\n\nSo they have a special program they use for competitions that spits out a combination of 20 moves that will result in a properly messed up cube that is fully 20 moves from solution.  There are LOTS of positions like this, so it can use a different one for each cube each contestant solves and they'll probably never see the same one twice.  This makes all cubes equally difficult to solve.\n\nNow, the speed solvers take more than 20 moves to solve these cubes because the human brain can't really simulate the cube that well, so the humans use less efficient algorithm methods rather than figuring out the absolute best way to solve that very specific configuration.  Still, they're very fast.\n\nSo, pseudo-random - a randomized selection from a curated pool of equally challenging configurations.  This configuration is obviously not in that pool.

You can apply heat directly to the bottom and it transfers through, but doesn't heat the glass in other areas, such as a handle.

This law from about 20-25 years ago  requires that public access facilities provide accommodations for people with disabilities. This absolutely meant accommodations in NEW facilities; business with older facilities were required to provide them if it didn't provide a hardship to their business.\n\nFor instance in Seattle there is (actually was) a movie theater called the Harvard Exit. It had a small walkup set of steps to the entrance, as well as two screens: one on the main floor and one up a flight of stairs. There was no easy way to build in an elevator in the almost century old building, but they COULD at least build a ramp to main entrance. So that's what they did. If you had a mobility issue that prevented you from climbing a flight of stairs, well you couldn't watch a movie on their upstairs screen. But you could still attend movies downstairs.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the actuator in the OP's video was something similar; an accommodation to the extent that was reasonable.\n\nBeyond that, the universal \"wheelchair\" logo tends to unintentionally lead to incorrect assumptions about people who might need accommodations. My uncle has a heart/lung condition that leaves him desperately winded and at risk of passing out from walks on an incline (he was in the ER last friday from this). He doesn't use or need a wheelchair and surprisingly going up or down stairs is not a problem.

He was there because he had to buy an anniversary gift for my mom because their anniversary is in the first week of January, and he wore a sweatshirt, basketball shorts, calf high socks, and his ugly-ass neon-green crocs and the look that you saw on the peoples faces when they see this 58 year old man dressed like that. And they were more likely to say \"sir are you lost, do you need some help?\" rather than \"hi welcome to Tiffany's!\"\n\nAnd the funny thing is before he turned around 47-49, he generally was well dressed, I swear the moment you turn 50 you don't give a fuck about what you look like or what people think of you.

It also clears up traffic congestion, on top of it all.\n\nTo quote a University of Berkley study on it of May this year,\n\n> -Compared to riders who were not splitting lanes, lane-splitting motorcyclists were markedly less likely to suffer head injury (9 percent vs. 17 percent), torso injury (19 percent vs. 29 percent) or fatal injury (1.2 percent vs. 3 percent)\n\n>  Lane-splitting riders were significantly less likely to be rear-ended than non-lane-splitting riders (2.6 percent vs. 4.6 percent)\n\nSo even if you get into an accident, your injuries are significantly better off. That's because being sideswiped at a 5-10mph speed differential is a bruised ankle most likely, as seen in the gif above. Being rear ended at 10mph sends you flying into the bumper of the car in front of you, and may break your back.\n\nA study in Brussels as well has shown that if just 10% of cars became lane splitting motorcycle riders, time loss from traffic would be reduced by 40%, emissions would be reduced by 6%.
