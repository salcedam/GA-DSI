Meat goes in one container, literally everything else (bones, skin, drippings, etc) goes in another container. \n  * When baking the chickens in roasting pans, I like to use a beer or two (depends on size of chicken and your pan) in place of water in the pan. Ambers, stouts, and porters work really well to impart a nice flavor. You can use light beers, but cooking with light beer imparts so little flavor, you might as well just use water.\n  * You can buy rotisserie chickens and break them down, but they are very low fat and make much less tasty broth. I've tried this and would generally not recommend it.\n  * I typically bake a whole chicken, break it down, use the meat for a meal, and put all the carcas and drippings in a ziplock bag in the freezer and save them up. Once I have 2-3, I'll bake one final chicken the day I make stock and save that meat for the soup.

Drop them in the pot as you cut each biscuit and push them down to get them wet. Turn heat up to a low boil and push the dumplings down and stir occasionally until they don't float anymore. The biscuits will thicken the soup a little and make it creamier. You can make dumplings from scratch, but it's hard to beat the biscuits!\n  * For **rice**, use ~2 cups uncooked white rice.

Not needed, not wanted. just chicken, egg, lemon juice and rice. \n\nThe recipe is assuming a whole chicken, which will make a lot of soup. Avgolemano can be stored or frozen for a while. I reheats better on stovetop, but can be microwaved. \n\n- Place whole chicken into a large (5 qt) pot (I use the same kind of pot you use to cook pasta). \n- You could add some lemon juice to the water, which will give the meat a lemony tang to it. \n- Simmer until the meat is off the bone. It is fine if this takes all day. If you want to cook the chicken faster, buy parts not whole. The important part is it is bone-in. \n- Remove the chicken and keep the broth in the pot.\n- Take 2 cups stock and place in a second pot.\n- Add 1 cup rice and cook until al dente (rice measurement would scale based on how much chicken you are cooking)\n- While the rice is cooking, separate eggs. For a big pot, I usually do 8 eggs. Half a chicken would be 4 eggs. Much of this is to taste or desire. You're not going to ruin it by having a few less or a few more eggs. \n- Destring the eggs. I can't tell you how gross it is to eat the egg strings. (Meaning: remove those slimy white things).\n- In the yolk bowl, add some lemon juice and slowly temper with some of the stock. this will prevent the soup from becoming egg drop.\n- Blend or whisk the whites until they are off peak. \n- Slowly fold in the yolk mixture. The end result should be a pale yellow foamy mixture. \n- Slowly fold the egg mixture into the pot. This might take some time since the foam has a tendency to float to the top and spill over. \n- Keep mixing the egg mixture into the stock. It's important to do this slowly and thoroughly to make sure the eggs don't curdle.\n- End result should be a pale yellow, \"creamy\" soup.\n- Add cooked rice.\n- Add lemon juice to taste.\n- At this point, you can either add in the cooked chicken, or attempt to serve the chicken on the side. I started adding the chicken in since everyone wanted the white meat. Apparently once chicken is added to soup, no one cares anymore about trivial things like white or dark meat.\n\nIf the eggs curdle, it doesn't matter. It looks bad, but will taste the same. \n\nAn acceptable substitution for the rice is orzo (but I'm not a fan). You can absolutely ditch the rice.\n\nWe usually serve this with a greek salad (generally lettuce, tomato, cucumber and feta) and a baked potato (Alton Brown's recipe is aces for this). Though the soup is usually filling enough all on its own.\n\nWe can usually feed my husband and me for about three to four meals after the initial dinner if we use the big pot (which we do for the plethora of leftovers).\n\nThe reason I say don't add any of the fru-fru stuff a lot of the online recipes mention is that things like onion, celery and carrot ruin the delicate flavor of the traditional avgolemano and really what you have is western chicken and rice soup with some egg in and that is just a disappointing experience. A good avgolemano is just chicken, egg and lemon.\n\nYou want to make sure the rice is al dente going into the pot because carry-over will cook the rice ther rest of the way. if the rice is fully cooked, it will \"blow out\" by the time you serve, which just gives you mush. You could add the rice directly to the pot, but you also risk \"blowing out\" the rice and adding more starch to the soup than you might want. However, it's not going to kill the soup if it is a bit starchier. Mushy rice though... Bleh.\n\nAs for lemon juice - the *best* is whole lemons, but bottled lemon juice can serve just as well. The flavor will not be as delicate, but you need a lot of lemons to get the lemony taste, even if you want to go lightly on the flavor. Concentrate is a bit more coarse but has more bang for the buck as far as potency.\n\n"], [2, "Jewish chicken soup \n\nChicken, turnip, parsnip, onion, carrot, potato (sweet or regular), celery.

It's hard to screw up though!\n\n**Prep cooking**\n\n* **Roast 3-4 chickens**, one per roasting pan, and break them down when cooled. Meat goes in one container, literally everything else (bones, skin, drippings, etc) goes in another container. \n  * When baking the chickens in roasting pans, I like to use a beer or two (depends on size of chicken and your pan) in place of water in the pan. Ambers, stouts, and porters work really well to impart a nice flavor. You can use light beers, but cooking with light beer imparts so little flavor, you might as well just use water.\n  * You can buy rotisserie chickens and break them down, but they are very low fat and make much less tasty broth. I've tried this and would generally not recommend it.\n  * I typically bake a whole chicken, break it down, use the meat for a meal, and put all the carcas and drippings in a ziplock bag in the freezer and save them up. Once I have 2-3, I'll bake one final chicken the day I make stock and save that meat for the soup. You can also cook all of them one day and use 3/4 of the meat for meal prep or freeze it.\n* **Make stock** I prefer this recipe: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/chicken-stock-recipe.html\n\n**Making the soup**\n\n* In a 2 gallon pot, fill about 3/4 full of stock and turn on heat (bring to a simmer while prepping the rest)\n* Cut cooked meat from 1 chicken into big bite sized pieces (will come apart while cooking) and add to pot\n* Slice 3-4 medium carrots, add to pot\n* Slice 2 ribs of celery, add to pot\n* Chop 1 yellow onion, add to pot\n* Simmer until vegetables are almost cooked to your liking, about 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally\n* Add dumplings or rice\n  * For **dumplings**, I use one can of grands biscuits and cut each biscuit into 6 pieces. Drop them in the pot as you cut each biscuit and push them down to get them wet. Turn heat up to a low boil and push the dumplings down and stir occasionally until they don't float anymore. The biscuits will thicken the soup a little and make it creamier. You can make dumplings from scratch, but it's hard to beat the biscuits!\n  * For **rice**, use ~2 cups uncooked white rice.

Leave the bones and skin.  You can use the meat for sandwiches, ramen or other meals.\n* Chop the onions, leeks and celery moderate-finely.\n* Chop up the garlic finely.\n* Sautee the onions in some oil until aromatic.\n* Add the rest of the vegetables, chicken and water.\n* Bring to the boil and simmer on a low heat for 2-3 hours.\n* Add salt to taste.\n* Strain the liquid out.  This is your stock.\n\nYou can also put some hot water through the remaining material and strain out some more flavour from it.\n\nYou can freeze the chicken stock in a ziploc bag.  The batch above should make enough stock for about 3 or 4 freezer bags.  Check that it doesn't leak but usually a decent one won't.  Put a pint in quart bag (this is enough for 2 people) and it will lie flat in the freezer.

Not needed, not wanted. just chicken, egg, lemon juice and rice. \n\nThe recipe is assuming a whole chicken, which will make a lot of soup. Avgolemano can be stored or frozen for a while. I reheats better on stovetop, but can be microwaved. \n\n- Place whole chicken into a large (5 qt) pot (I use the same kind of pot you use to cook pasta). \n- You could add some lemon juice to the water, which will give the meat a lemony tang to it. \n- Simmer until the meat is off the bone. It is fine if this takes all day. If you want to cook the chicken faster, buy parts not whole. The important part is it is bone-in. \n- Remove the chicken and keep the broth in the pot.\n- Take 2 cups stock and place in a second pot.\n- Add 1 cup rice and cook until al dente (rice measurement would scale based on how much chicken you are cooking)\n- While the rice is cooking, separate eggs. For a big pot, I usually do 8 eggs. Half a chicken would be 4 eggs. Much of this is to taste or desire. You're not going to ruin it by having a few less or a few more eggs. \n- Destring the eggs. I can't tell you how gross it is to eat the egg strings. (Meaning: remove those slimy white things).\n- In the yolk bowl, add some lemon juice and slowly temper with some of the stock. this will prevent the soup from becoming egg drop.\n- Blend or whisk the whites until they are off peak. \n- Slowly fold in the yolk mixture. The end result should be a pale yellow foamy mixture. \n- Slowly fold the egg mixture into the pot. This might take some time since the foam has a tendency to float to the top and spill over. \n- Keep mixing the egg mixture into the stock. It's important to do this slowly and thoroughly to make sure the eggs don't curdle.\n- End result should be a pale yellow, \"creamy\" soup.\n- Add cooked rice.\n- Add lemon juice to taste.\n- At this point, you can either add in the cooked chicken, or attempt to serve the chicken on the side. I started adding the chicken in since everyone wanted the white meat. Apparently once chicken is added to soup, no one cares anymore about trivial things like white or dark meat.\n\nIf the eggs curdle, it doesn't matter. It looks bad, but will taste the same. \n\nAn acceptable substitution for the rice is orzo (but I'm not a fan). You can absolutely ditch the rice.\n\nWe usually serve this with a greek salad (generally lettuce, tomato, cucumber and feta) and a baked potato (Alton Brown's recipe is aces for this). Though the soup is usually filling enough all on its own.\n\nWe can usually feed my husband and me for about three to four meals after the initial dinner if we use the big pot (which we do for the plethora of leftovers).\n\nThe reason I say don't add any of the fru-fru stuff a lot of the online recipes mention is that things like onion, celery and carrot ruin the delicate flavor of the traditional avgolemano and really what you have is western chicken and rice soup with some egg in and that is just a disappointing experience. A good avgolemano is just chicken, egg and lemon.\n\nYou want to make sure the rice is al dente going into the pot because carry-over will cook the rice ther rest of the way. if the rice is fully cooked, it will \"blow out\" by the time you serve, which just gives you mush. You could add the rice directly to the pot, but you also risk \"blowing out\" the rice and adding more starch to the soup than you might want. However, it's not going to kill the soup if it is a bit starchier. Mushy rice though... Bleh.\n\nAs for lemon juice - the *best* is whole lemons, but bottled lemon juice can serve just as well. The flavor will not be as delicate, but you need a lot of lemons to get the lemony taste, even if you want to go lightly on the flavor. Concentrate is a bit more coarse but has more bang for the buck as far as potency.\n\n", "id": "d99vjm1"}], [{"comment": "Jewish chicken soup \n\nChicken, turnip, parsnip, onion, carrot, potato (sweet or regular), celery.

But because the supermarkets are selling it for that price, it means their wholesale price is lower around $0.08 cents perhaps. And then there is the dumpling factory who also needs to make a profit.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute. That is way too cheap. My uncle worked for one of the big dumpling plants back in 2008, he stopped after a couple of days because the stench of the smell from the meat in the factory was too much for him. He said the factory bought rejected meat, cut out the bad parts where maggots were growing and then used them in the dumplings. \n\nNobody in my family buys meat dumplings or wontons anymore. Vegetable dumplings when we are in a time crunch. Meat no. Instead we take a day every couple of months and make around 100 dumplings. \n\nCost to make 100 dumplings:\n\nDumpling wrappers: $4\n\n2 lbs pork shoulder ground: $6\n\n2 lbs leek: $5\n\n2 eggs: $0.30\n\nTotal cost of homemade dumplings: $15.30\n\nCost per dumpling: $0.15\n\nWhen homemade costs more than the selling price of pre-made, I get wary.\n\nAnyway just my two cents. Also you may notice that white pepper is present in almost every meat dumpling. The reason is because white pepper disguises the age/freshness of meat.\n\nEdit: For those who are saying economies of scales. I understand completely because my friend's father owns a wholesale noodle factory in NYC. The reason he choose to open a noodle factory and not dumpling was because of the meat issue. He did not want to serve his customers meat that he himself would not eat.

The rice is the most calories/dollar, and it will last you nearly the entire month. EVOO is healthy for you, can be added to your cooking or can be consumed by itself (I shoot it each morning). Butter can be eaten or cooked with like the EVOO. \n\nJust some ideas. Not trying to critique you at all. I know the struggle of stretching a dollar. Was living on $800/month pre-tax this time last year. And even now I'm only making twice that amount, but the number of mouths I feed has doubled, as has rent, so it's a wash really.

In order to maintain your weight you'd need to consume 1950 kcal per day, or 13,650 a week. The items you've listed total:\n\n(Using Google's calorie counter for calories)\n1 dozen large eggs = 72 kcal x 12= 864 kcal\n2 small avocados = 322 kcal x 2 = 644 kcal\n1 roma tomato = 35 kcal\n1 head of lettuce = 53 kcal\n1 can refried beans = 406 kcal\n1 small container sour cream (assuming you bought the 230g container) = 445 kcal\n1 bag shreded cheese (assuming you bought 1 lb of cheese, which is the normal size it is sold in) = 1831 kcal\n30 tostada shells = 150 kcal x 30 = 4500 kcal\n1 bag of broccoli (assuming standard 14oz bag) = 150 kcal\n\nTotal kcal = 8928 kcal\n\n13,650 kcal - 8928 = 4722 kcal deficit.\n\nIf this is all you ate you'd lose 1.33 pounds per week or just about five pounds per month. If you do not wish to be on a caloric deficit I suggest finding some cheap items that are high in calories. Here are some ideas, again calories are going to come from Google. Prices will be low, because my eggs cost $0.78/dozen, so I'm assuming I live in a place with a significantly lower cost of living (and I probably do because I live in rural Virginia):\n\nFood | Price | kcal/container | kcal/dollar\n---|---|----|----\nCanned chick peas | $0.50 | 820 | 1640\n25 lb bag of LG white rice | $8.59 | 14,742 | 1716\nEVOO, 1.5 L | $10.98 | 11,900 | 1084\nButter, 1 lb | $2.99 | 3240 | 1084\n\nTo fix your deficit with chick pears would cost you about $3.00 more per week. The rice is the most calories/dollar, and it will last you nearly the entire month. EVOO is healthy for you, can be added to your cooking or can be consumed by itself (I shoot it each morning). Butter can be eaten or cooked with like the EVOO. \n\nJust some ideas. Not trying to critique you at all. I know the struggle of stretching a dollar. Was living on $800/month pre-tax this time last year. And even now I'm only making twice that amount, but the number of mouths I feed has doubled, as has rent, so it's a wash really.

So that's a lot better and much cheaper to fix since that's only 2 and a half cans of chick peas, or $1.50 a week to keep on top of it. \n\nAn easy meal that my wife and I make a lot is enchiladas. As a vegetarian you'd need to substitute out the chicken, and I don't know the going price on tofu, but one of our cheapest meals is definitely enchiladas (and it keeps with your theme of Mexican food). All you need to add to what you have is rice, a few spices for flavor, and switch the tostadas for either tortillas or corn meal and shortening to make your own tortillas (cheaper, healthier, and better tasting). \n\nI think when I was living on as little as possible my go-to meal was a peanut butter sandwich.

I could set my roommate's rice cooker to make rice that was done every morning at 7am. I'd eat rice for breakfast with dried onions, sriracha sauce, and an egg.

Cook dry beans (I use the pressure cook feature on my instant pot, but you can cook them on the stovetop too).  Can prepare these in advance- just cook and freeze.\n\n2.  Brown beef in a hot pan.  Make sure it gets some color.  Add chopped onion, and cook until translucent.\n\n3.  Add drained, rinsed beans, meat mixture, tomatoes, and seasonings to a 6 qt slow cooker.  Add additional water to cover all of the ingredients.  Cook on low for 8 hours or high for 4, or until the flavors combine to your liking.\n\nServe over rice, mashed potatoes, or with cheese and sour cream.  This also handles being frozen very well, so you can make a bunch at once and freeze it in meal-sized portions.\n\n*  This recipe can also be halved, but use only 1 cup dried beans and 2 cans tomatoes.  \n\n*  Also try adding corn, mushrooms, or other vegetables if you desire.  I imagine you could also use different kinds of beans- I've used pinto before to great success. \n", "id": "d006z84"}, {"comment": "85% beef should be drained of grease before adding to the chili", "id": "d00ab9u"}, {"comment": "I'm broke I want that grease", "id": "d00fcff"}, {"comment": "Not from the US, what is 85%? \n\nEDIT: in this context ", "id": "d00izy4"}, {"comment": "Not from the US either, but usually ground beef is a mix of ground meat and ground fat.

Cook the vegetables slightly, I microwave them for a couple minutes. Take the tofu out of the oven after 20 min or when its started to get a bit crispy.

There are a ton of simple and easy to make recipes you can cook in a crockpot and you can add as many or as few vegetables as you like to it.\n\nI've never been to ireland, so I don't know what kind of meats/sauces are usually available, but a general rule of thumb for crockpots is get some meat (chicken, beef, pork are all good choices.  Doesn't have to be too expensive.  Cooking it for so long should soften it up a bit), some vegetables (carrots, corn, onions, peppers, potatoes, zucchini, squash, pretty much anything you like the flavor of) and throw everything in the crock pot with some kind of liquid.  This can be done with just enough liquid to cover the bottom or enough to cover everything.\n\nSo, an example recipe that's quite easy and flavorful, Salsa Chicken.  Can you get salsa at a store?  Salsa is general full of vegetables and not too high in calories.  Get a couple of cans of that, a couple of pounds of chicken thighs or breasts (remove the skin and bones before cooking), some corn, beans (black beans are good.  If your beans are canned, drain them, rinse them, and just throw them in.  If they'r dry beans, you have to prep them and there should be instructions on the bag/box.), onions, and peppers (spicy ones if you like that), and throw everything in the crockpot on low heat for 6 hours (chicken should be fully cooked by then).  Once it's finished cooking, you can either leave the chicken whole in there (it will probably be pretty tender and fall apart naturally) or you can pull it out on a plate and take two forks and \"shred\" it (by shred it, I me basically just use the forks to really tear up the chicken into lots of little bits) and then eat it with the vegetable salsa mix.\n\nYou should be able to eat that for several meals.  you can also eat it with a starch, such as rice if you want.\n\nI recommend visiting /r/Slowcooking if you're interested."], [9, "It is helpful to plan out your week/next couple of days before going to the supermarket.

Good spices can save most meals (don't limit yourself to salt and pepper), have fun and experiment. You don't need meat everyday, it can be expensive and vegetarian meals can be delicious. Don't cut it out entirely unless you know what your doing and have done your research though. \n\nI had a similar problem when I first moved out, not because my parents didn't know how to cook healthy, but because I never learned to cook. It has taken me many years to unlearn the habits I developed those first years living alone. \n\nWhat I've come to rely on is my local Arabian and Chinese shops. At the Arabian shops I buy cheap vegetables and stuff like bags of bulgur, lentils and beans, at the Chinese shop I buy spices, mushrooms, and large quantities of high quality noodles. I will also look at local butchers for relatively cheap pieces of meat that I can freeze. As others have mentioned, Chicken is always a good basic to have. With a little bit of planning I can cook delicious healthy food and not blow my student budget. \n\nI think my main cooking rules at this point are:\n\n* Spices, dried mushrooms and different sauces are all life savers. Try to diversify what you have, using different spices can save an otherwise boring meal and give you very different experiences with the same ingredients, especially stuff like curry, Cajun herb mixes, a little bit of good olive oil, teriyaki, etc. Experiment with different spice mixes. It's fun and can last for years. \n\n* I try to always include at least three different vegetables in everything I cook. My kitchen is usually stocked with red onions, garlic, zucchinis, cauliflower, broccoli, red peppers, spinach, whatever cabbage is in season, carrots, potatoes and tomatoes. Sometimes I buy stuff like apples and grapes as well, they're both a delicious snack as well as a nice sweet element you can add to your cooking. Lemons are also great to add a sour note to your cooking. \n\n* Try to always consider the different taste groups. You can make a pretty simple healthy meal and still include all the flavors if you use some spices. It just makes for a more interesting meal to find something sweet, sour, salt, bitter and umami (which the mushrooms can add) if possible of course. A salad on the side is a great opportunity to add more flavors. \n\n* You don't need meat everyday. Meat is expensive, and at least personally I try to eat meat only every second day. \n\n* A wok (or a big pot) is a brilliant invention. One of my favorite quick meals to make is to simply to throw in what ever meat I have and some onions and fry them, throw in a couple of different chopped up vegetables, add a little teriyaki or coconut milk, some spices, and finally add some rice noodles or some beans (cooked in a separate pot depending on how processed they already are), and bam, you have a nice, healthy and inexpensive meal that took very little work to make and can last for days. \n\n* Finally, Google is your friend. I tend to start from what nice looking cheap vegetables I can find and then I try to Google for a healthy meal that includes them. Before you know it you know a lot of good basic recipes. \n\nGood luck, learning to cook can be an intimidating challenge, but I promise it is worth it once you experience the satisfaction of having produced a truly delicious home cooked meal. \n\nEdit: corrected spelling mistakes, added a few vegetables I forgot, and changed it from always to usually because these things are in rotation depending on my budget and what is on sale.

Just about any meat and vegetable with a light drizzle of oil and some salt and pepper lightly cooked on a grill is some of easiest and healthiest cooking I do. \n\n\nHere's my technique for perfect sticky white rice: (cobbled from various sources on the web)\n\n\n1. Get a sauce pan, some long grain white rice (I haven't tried this method with other kinds of rice), make sure you have a cover that fits your sauce pan.\n\n\n2.Decide how much rice you want to cook. 2 cups is fine in a saucepan.\n\n\n3. Wash your rice in the pan in the sink, filling the pan with water and moving the rice around with your fingers. I do this 3-4 times, until leaving the water for a minute and moving the rice around leaves the water relatively clear. Some folks say this removes essential starches and nutrients, I have had zero success other than this method.\n\n\n4. Soak your rice for 10-15 minutes. This will soften your rice so it will be fluffy. \n\n\n5. When you're ready to cook, pat down your rice so it's level and add fresh water about one knuckle length about .75\" or 1.5cm or so above the top line of the rice. This eyeballing method works flawlessly for me.\n\n\n6. First get your rice to a rolling boil for 1-2 minutes. Then cover it (your cover needs to fit) and simmer on low to medium low heat for 20 minutes. Do not under any circumstances remove the cover.\n\n\n7. Do not remove the cover. After it has simmered for 20 minutes, remove from heat. Do not remove the cover. Do not remove the cover, and do not remove the cover, while you let sit for 10-15 minutes and do not together the cover. Do not remove the cover during this time. Do not remove the cover. \n\n\n8. Did you leave the cover on? Good! You should see the top of the rice creating little holes in the top layer. These are speed/steam holes and make the rice go faster/steam in its own self rice steam do not remove the cover heat. After 10-15 minutes you may remove the cover. If you followed my steps exactly and if you did not remove the cover when I specifically asked you not to remove the cover,  when you remove the cover you should have perfect, sticky long grain white rice. \n\n\n\nHere's a recipe for Alfredo sauce: (great with steamed vegetables, pro tip: you can steam vegetables while you cook pasta for your sauce) \n\n\n1. Get a good solid wedge of Parmesan cheese. Size should be like a smallish slice of pizza. Not a large wedge, not a Tiny wedge, a medium wedge. Get that and a good smallish 1-2 cup 16 oz or so carton of whipping cream/heavy cream/heavy shipping cream. You'll also need some butter, a bit of flour, and a cheese grater. And a whisk. A proper whisk.\n\n\n2. Grate all the cheese. You should have 1-2 cups of grated cheese. Boil some water for pasta. Drizzle some veggies, broccoli is good, with oil and salt and pepper. Don't forget to wash and trim your veggies!\n\n\n3. Some folks would start by melting a good sized glob of butter and slowly adding flour and then adding and simmering your cream. \nSometimes I will simmer my cream and just slowly add about a good sized teaspoon of flour. Flour when added gradually will thicken sauces and gravies. You don't want much but you need more than a pinch.  A good sized teaspoon will do. So get that in your simmering cream (use the whole carton) by either method. Medium to medium high heat is ok leading into the next step. Maybe throw your pasta in here. Spaghetti or linguini or fettuccini or angel hair is good. \n\n\n4. Gradually add small handfuls of Parmesan cheese to your simmering/boiling cream with flour. Use your whisk here, keep adding Parmesan as it melts while you whisk, slowly. Keep tasting as desired until you feel like you have enough cheese. I usually use all of what I have. Keep whisking until the cheese is melted. Move to low to medium low heat. A low simmer is best. \n\n\n5. Meanwhile you should have been cooking pasta to a bit 'al Dente' not overcooked but still firm and very edible. F you have 2 colanders or a separate steam tray for your veggies (broccoli is good here) this next step is easier. I have to put my veggies I. A separate container, rinse my colander to drain my pasta. When timed right, everything is done at the right time. I like to chop my steamed broccoli before eating but it's just as good chunky. \n\n\n\nI taught myself to cook at 30. You have a hell of a head start! Biggest tip I can give you is more fruits more veggies! I like fruit in the morning and veggies all day myself!\n\n\nCheers and good luck!\n"], [1, "When I first started cooking for myself at university, I used this (free!) website a lot: http://resourcefulcook.com/\n\nIt has lots of premade meal plans, recipes with pictures of the finished meal and shopping lists (you can print or send to email), for different price brackets etc. The meal plans are good, since they try to use up all the ingredients (if one recipe uses half a can of corn or sth, then another would also require half a can). Just pick one, where you think all the recipes look good.\n\nSince I was cooking for just myself, I could usually get away with using the quick shop lists for 4 as my weekly lunches and dinners. Eating leftovers is key.\n\nSadly the website is somewhat lacking in vegetarian options, so I don't use it much anymore, but it was a great help for me in the beginning of my learning-to-cook adventures, so I hope it might be good to you too."], [1, "So a couple thoughts.  There's a lot of comments so I've only read the top few so my apologies if these are mention elsewhere.  Also I'm in the US so my recommendations may not apply with different availability of foods.\n\nFirst thing, try a rotisserie chicken.  I love using whole raw chicken myself but using a precooked rotisserie would be a great way to start a few basic things.  You could just eat the chicken itself with some sides, you could shred it up and put on a tortilla with some salsa for tacos.  Then when you have the carcass you can try making your first batch of chicken stock!\n\nAlso frozen veggies are great, don't give up on them.  They're great to have on hand and won't go bad for a LONG time.  Root veggies are great for buying fresh because they last pretty long but things like broccoli and corn are best to get frozen.  \n\nAlso, potatoes are pretty great, but I can see how it would get dull with every meal.  A good idea would be to try sweet potatoes.  You can prepare them in much the same way and are a little different.  Also try replacing the potato in a meal with rice, a little variety.  \n\nAlso a basic tomato sauce is easy to make from a can of crushed tomatoes.  Just google it and you'll find plenty of great recipes. \n\nEDIT: Also look for farmers markets, they're usually a great deal for produce."], [1, "A really easy thing is to cook fish in tin foil. You buy a fillet of fish (I recommend salmon), find some simple fish marinade or spices (lemon juice + pepper, or thyme and oregano), and maybe chop up some vegetables (shallots or tomatoes or something).

One recipe i really like is [this](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/giada-de-laurentiis/salmon-baked-in-foil-recipe.html), but you can do it with lots of other fish / sauces / vegetables.

Boil until meat is done, the quinoa and lentils usually will be too. Turn down heat, season with your favorite seasonings (I like to mix it up, curry if I'm doing seafood/chicken or cajun/latin if beef or pork.) Add any additional veggies for nutrition and cook about 5-8 more minutes(spinach, kale etc.) At the end, you have a nice hot meal of complex carbs, protein and veggies.

This can be done with just enough liquid to cover the bottom or enough to cover everything.\n\nSo, an example recipe that's quite easy and flavorful, Salsa Chicken.  Can you get salsa at a store?  Salsa is general full of vegetables and not too high in calories.  Get a couple of cans of that, a couple of pounds of chicken thighs or breasts (remove the skin and bones before cooking), some corn, beans (black beans are good.  If your beans are canned, drain them, rinse them, and just throw them in.  If they'r dry beans, you have to prep them and there should be instructions on the bag/box.), onions, and peppers (spicy ones if you like that), and throw everything in the crockpot on low heat for 6 hours (chicken should be fully cooked by then).  Once it's finished cooking, you can either leave the chicken whole in there (it will probably be pretty tender and fall apart naturally) or you can pull it out on a plate and take two forks and \"shred\" it (by shred it, I me basically just use the forks to really tear up the chicken into lots of little bits) and then eat it with the vegetable salsa mix.\n\nYou should be able to eat that for several meals.  you can also eat it with a starch, such as rice if you want.\n\nI recommend visiting /r/Slowcooking if you're interested.", "id": "d55k7i3"}], [{"comment": "It is helpful to plan out your week/next couple of days before going to the supermarket.

Good spices can save most meals (don't limit yourself to salt and pepper), have fun and experiment. You don't need meat everyday, it can be expensive and vegetarian meals can be delicious. Don't cut it out entirely unless you know what your doing and have done your research though. \n\nI had a similar problem when I first moved out, not because my parents didn't know how to cook healthy, but because I never learned to cook. It has taken me many years to unlearn the habits I developed those first years living alone. \n\nWhat I've come to rely on is my local Arabian and Chinese shops. At the Arabian shops I buy cheap vegetables and stuff like bags of bulgur, lentils and beans, at the Chinese shop I buy spices, mushrooms, and large quantities of high quality noodles. I will also look at local butchers for relatively cheap pieces of meat that I can freeze. As others have mentioned, Chicken is always a good basic to have. With a little bit of planning I can cook delicious healthy food and not blow my student budget. \n\nI think my main cooking rules at this point are:\n\n* Spices, dried mushrooms and different sauces are all life savers. Try to diversify what you have, using different spices can save an otherwise boring meal and give you very different experiences with the same ingredients, especially stuff like curry, Cajun herb mixes, a little bit of good olive oil, teriyaki, etc. Experiment with different spice mixes. It's fun and can last for years. \n\n* I try to always include at least three different vegetables in everything I cook. My kitchen is usually stocked with red onions, garlic, zucchinis, cauliflower, broccoli, red peppers, spinach, whatever cabbage is in season, carrots, potatoes and tomatoes. Sometimes I buy stuff like apples and grapes as well, they're both a delicious snack as well as a nice sweet element you can add to your cooking. Lemons are also great to add a sour note to your cooking. \n\n* Try to always consider the different taste groups. You can make a pretty simple healthy meal and still include all the flavors if you use some spices. It just makes for a more interesting meal to find something sweet, sour, salt, bitter and umami (which the mushrooms can add) if possible of course. A salad on the side is a great opportunity to add more flavors. \n\n* You don't need meat everyday. Meat is expensive, and at least personally I try to eat meat only every second day. \n\n* A wok (or a big pot) is a brilliant invention. One of my favorite quick meals to make is to simply to throw in what ever meat I have and some onions and fry them, throw in a couple of different chopped up vegetables, add a little teriyaki or coconut milk, some spices, and finally add some rice noodles or some beans (cooked in a separate pot depending on how processed they already are), and bam, you have a nice, healthy and inexpensive meal that took very little work to make and can last for days. \n\n* Finally, Google is your friend. I tend to start from what nice looking cheap vegetables I can find and then I try to Google for a healthy meal that includes them. Before you know it you know a lot of good basic recipes. \n\nGood luck, learning to cook can be an intimidating challenge, but I promise it is worth it once you experience the satisfaction of having produced a truly delicious home cooked meal. \n\nEdit: corrected spelling mistakes, added a few vegetables I forgot, and changed it from always to usually because these things are in rotation depending on my budget and what is on sale.

Just about any meat and vegetable with a light drizzle of oil and some salt and pepper lightly cooked on a grill is some of easiest and healthiest cooking I do. \n\n\nHere's my technique for perfect sticky white rice: (cobbled from various sources on the web)\n\n\n1. Get a sauce pan, some long grain white rice (I haven't tried this method with other kinds of rice), make sure you have a cover that fits your sauce pan.\n\n\n2.Decide how much rice you want to cook. 2 cups is fine in a saucepan.\n\n\n3. Wash your rice in the pan in the sink, filling the pan with water and moving the rice around with your fingers. I do this 3-4 times, until leaving the water for a minute and moving the rice around leaves the water relatively clear. Some folks say this removes essential starches and nutrients, I have had zero success other than this method.\n\n\n4. Soak your rice for 10-15 minutes. This will soften your rice so it will be fluffy. \n\n\n5. When you're ready to cook, pat down your rice so it's level and add fresh water about one knuckle length about .75\" or 1.5cm or so above the top line of the rice. This eyeballing method works flawlessly for me.\n\n\n6. First get your rice to a rolling boil for 1-2 minutes. Then cover it (your cover needs to fit) and simmer on low to medium low heat for 20 minutes. Do not under any circumstances remove the cover.\n\n\n7. Do not remove the cover. After it has simmered for 20 minutes, remove from heat. Do not remove the cover. Do not remove the cover, and do not remove the cover, while you let sit for 10-15 minutes and do not together the cover. Do not remove the cover during this time. Do not remove the cover. \n\n\n8. Did you leave the cover on? Good! You should see the top of the rice creating little holes in the top layer. These are speed/steam holes and make the rice go faster/steam in its own self rice steam do not remove the cover heat. After 10-15 minutes you may remove the cover. If you followed my steps exactly and if you did not remove the cover when I specifically asked you not to remove the cover,  when you remove the cover you should have perfect, sticky long grain white rice. \n\n\n\nHere's a recipe for Alfredo sauce: (great with steamed vegetables, pro tip: you can steam vegetables while you cook pasta for your sauce) \n\n\n1. Get a good solid wedge of Parmesan cheese. Size should be like a smallish slice of pizza. Not a large wedge, not a Tiny wedge, a medium wedge. Get that and a good smallish 1-2 cup 16 oz or so carton of whipping cream/heavy cream/heavy shipping cream. You'll also need some butter, a bit of flour, and a cheese grater. And a whisk. A proper whisk.\n\n\n2. Grate all the cheese. You should have 1-2 cups of grated cheese. Boil some water for pasta. Drizzle some veggies, broccoli is good, with oil and salt and pepper. Don't forget to wash and trim your veggies!\n\n\n3. Some folks would start by melting a good sized glob of butter and slowly adding flour and then adding and simmering your cream. \nSometimes I will simmer my cream and just slowly add about a good sized teaspoon of flour. Flour when added gradually will thicken sauces and gravies. You don't want much but you need more than a pinch.  A good sized teaspoon will do. So get that in your simmering cream (use the whole carton) by either method. Medium to medium high heat is ok leading into the next step. Maybe throw your pasta in here. Spaghetti or linguini or fettuccini or angel hair is good. \n\n\n4. Gradually add small handfuls of Parmesan cheese to your simmering/boiling cream with flour. Use your whisk here, keep adding Parmesan as it melts while you whisk, slowly. Keep tasting as desired until you feel like you have enough cheese. I usually use all of what I have. Keep whisking until the cheese is melted. Move to low to medium low heat. A low simmer is best. \n\n\n5. Meanwhile you should have been cooking pasta to a bit 'al Dente' not overcooked but still firm and very edible. F you have 2 colanders or a separate steam tray for your veggies (broccoli is good here) this next step is easier. I have to put my veggies I. A separate container, rinse my colander to drain my pasta. When timed right, everything is done at the right time. I like to chop my steamed broccoli before eating but it's just as good chunky. \n\n\n\nI taught myself to cook at 30. You have a hell of a head start!

I love using whole raw chicken myself but using a precooked rotisserie would be a great way to start a few basic things.  You could just eat the chicken itself with some sides, you could shred it up and put on a tortilla with some salsa for tacos.

They're great to have on hand and won't go bad for a LONG time.  Root veggies are great for buying fresh because they last pretty long but things like broccoli and corn are best to get frozen.  \n\nAlso, potatoes are pretty great, but I can see how it would get dull with every meal.  A good idea would be to try sweet potatoes.  You can prepare them in much the same way and are a little different.  Also try replacing the potato in a meal with rice, a little variety.  \n\nAlso a basic tomato sauce is easy to make from a can of crushed tomatoes.

Boil until meat is done, the quinoa and lentils usually will be too. Turn down heat, season with your favorite seasonings (I like to mix it up, curry if I'm doing seafood/chicken or cajun/latin if beef or pork.)

While water is heating up, chop/dice/slice (your preference) the onion, celery, and carrots. Add vegetables and bouillon cubes to pot, bring to a boil, and simmer for 45 mins to 1 hour. Remove carcass from pot and place in large baking dish to let cool. When cool enough to touch, separate bones out of the remaining meat and discard (or save for other uses if you're a \"use the whole buffalo\" kind of person). All the remaining meat should fall right off the bones. If it doesn't, the carcass may need to cook a bit longer. After all bones and gristly bits separated from meat, place meat back in pot and serve.\n\n\n\nBest soup I've ever eaten, hands down. Grandma also made homemade drop dumplings in the same pot while grandpa separated the meat from the bones, but that would put me over the 6 ingredient limit for this thread!"], [10, "Lazy carbonara\n\nIngredients: single portion noodles, egg, Parmesean cheese, spices of choice (I use salt, pepper, basil, oregano, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes), optional: cooked bacon or panchetta\n\nCook noodles.

You'll cook them past the caramelization point but you might not notice it because you'll be cooking at higher temperatures than what's typically used for caramelization.

While water is heating up, chop/dice/slice (your preference) the onion, celery, and carrots. Add vegetables and bouillon cubes to pot, bring to a boil, and simmer for 45 mins to 1 hour. Remove carcass from pot and place in large baking dish to let cool. When cool enough to touch, separate bones out of the remaining meat and discard (or save for other uses if you're a \"use the whole buffalo\" kind of person). All the remaining meat should fall right off the bones. If it doesn't, the carcass may need to cook a bit longer. After all bones and gristly bits separated from meat, place meat back in pot and serve.\n\n\n\nBest soup I've ever eaten, hands down.

The feet make the broth really gelatinous and it's an excellent source of easily assimilated glucosamine.

I began making this because I was told my dog had severe arthritis. It turned out she had a tumor affecting her nervous system, but I do think the bone broth helped. For one thing, she never was a good eater and being ill would have normally caused her to stop eating, but she actually had a good appetite and I think that helped keep her strength up. She also lived a lot longer than we expected and had normal poops for basically the first time ever. I still make the broth occasionally for my new dogs.

You want a temperature where the oil is boiling, but not burning. So for olive oil you want something around 165-170 degrees celsius, err on the lower side. And just give it a lot of time, like 40-50 minutes in the oven isn't unreasonable. Perhaps open the oven and toss them around a bit two or three times over the course of that time. If the oil looks like it's too much you can raise the temperature a little bit, say 230 celsius for about 10 minutes, and it might also be a good touch towards the end of the time in the oven to do that anyway.\n\nIf all goes well you'll have the most delicious, crispy but soft on the inside potatoes you'll ever get.

With some thought and experiments you can make the best chips ever. It's not complicated, but a lot of people mess it up.

You want a lot of surface area, so you can try letting your imagination go wild too. Put them in a pot to boil and boil until they're soft, about 15-20 minutes.\n\nAfter draining the water, get them in an oven tray, not totally crammed together because they need a little bit of space. Put black pepper and salt on it, and whatever else you like on potatoes. Rosemary is also good. And olive oil. Quite a bit of olive oil, but not totally drenching.\n\nNow, the trick is, and what most people mess up, is having the temperature too high. You want a temperature where the oil is boiling, but not burning. So for olive oil you want something around 165-170 degrees celsius, err on the lower side. And just give it a lot of time, like 40-50 minutes in the oven isn't unreasonable. Perhaps open the oven and toss them around a bit two or three times over the course of that time. If the oil looks like it's too much you can raise the temperature a little bit, say 230 celsius for about 10 minutes, and it might also be a good touch towards the end of the time in the oven to do that anyway.\n\nIf all goes well you'll have the most delicious, crispy but soft on the inside potatoes you'll ever get.

Turns out, at the store, there is no difference. \"Free range\" is defined as the chicken having X square feet of space -- something like 6 sq ft or something stupid like that, as opposed to the normal CFO setup where the chicken is kept in a 1 sq ft cage her whole life. Both are (IMHO) inhumane and certainly not \"free range.\"\n\nI began raising my own chickens two and a half years ago. The first dozen eggs I got, I almost had to force down, because they were *so* much richer than store-bought eggs. The flavor difference (and nutrient profile) is honestly night and day. The color is even significantly different. Truly free-range eggs (from chickens that get most of their nutrition from bugs and junk rather than cheap grain) have a strong orange color to them. Eggs from the store have a yellow yolk. In nature, a yellow yolk means a sick hen. In the farming industry, sure, it's not necessarily sick, but it's certainly less than optimal, to say the least.\n\nThere is no placebo involved, but you can only actually get fresh, free range eggs if you get them from a small family farm. Corporate farms do things extremely differently for ease of management at scale.\n\nI really do suggest that you drive around in the country for about an hour one day looking for signs that say \"farm fresh eggs\" or similar. As soon as you find one, go in, get to know the farmer(s), and buy a dozen. I promise you'll understand the difference people talk about as soon as you eat them. The best responses I've ever gotten from baking? Yea -- eggs from my own hens and real butter. Natural ingredients just taste better -- I can't speak *too* much about nutrient content, etc, but the flavor profile is noticeably different.\n\nAlso, I should mention -- when people talk about \"fresh\" eggs, there are a few different things involved... To me, a \"fresh\" egg is less than 24 hours old. That is a fantastically great tasting egg and is especially good in baked goods or fried. A \"fresh\" egg from the store (that you bought today) is generally about 4 weeks old already, or at least 2, anyway. An egg takes at least 6 weeks to go bad if it's taken care of in any way. With farm-fresh eggs, you actually have to let them sit unused for over a month before you can hard boil them because if you don't, the white will tear from being too bound to the inner membrane of the egg.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnyway -- I could go on forever about eggs and I realize that it's probably a bad idea to do so, even as I've likely gone on too long as it is, so I'll just stop now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTL;DR: Get real eggs from a small-scale farmer if you want to see what everyone is crowing about.", "id": "cz6nf3t"}, {"comment": "That was actually a great read and very informative, id love for you to go on if you have the time.\n\nI do see those signs from time to time and I think I know of a specific location just outside of town that always sells them.

In case you're curious, and as you might already know, the premise behind the function of a pressure cooker is that \"boiling\" as a process occurs at a temperature that is dependent on the pressure of the ambient air (e.g. water boils more quickly, and thus, at a lower temperature, in Denver than New Orleans because the ambient air pressure is lower in Denver.) Also important is to note that the temperature of water cannot rise above the boiling point at a given ambient air pressure. So, at sea level, you can't heat water to a higher temperature than 100 \u00baC/212 \u00baF.\n\nThe point of a pressure cooker is to raise the pressure of the ambient air above the water inside it, thus raising the boiling point of the contained water and allowing it to be heated to higher temperatures, and thus achieve faster cook times.\n\nSince the issue with legume lectins like phytohemagglutinin is the need to cook to a high enough temperature, pressure cooking is effective.

Soaking the beans and cookign them also leaches the substance from the beans, which is why you discard the soak water.

Whole pumpkins are great for you: Vitamins A, Bs, C, E, fiber, phytonutrients, all kinds of good shit. But I'd be surprised if there were *any* Vitamin C left after this process's initial dehydration, considering it's a water-soluble vitamin. Same for Vitamin B. (If you don't believe me that dehydrated fruit loses vitamins, then check the Vitamin C content of grapes vs. raisins.) The only stuff that will remain mostly unchanged is the minerals, like iron, magnesium, calcium, etc.\n\nI can't think of a specific reason why Vitamins A and E wouldn't survive this dehydrating/pulverization process, but from the wan color of the post-dehydration blend, it looks they didn't make it. Otherwise they'd be more of an intense yellow or warm orange color (yes, you can reliably tell the content of certain vitamins based on a fruit's color -- and yes, pumpkin is botanically a fruit). \n\nI would guess that the fiber is pretty wrecked, too. Fiber's main function in your GI tract is to surround sugar molecules, so that your gut bacteria break it down slowly over time. This is good because it slows the release of sugars, kinda like a time-release capsule, so that your liver can handle it and you don't have to excrete too much insulin. But degraded fiber like the end result of this process isn't going to be very useful for this kind of thing. Studies have shown that even putting whole fresh produce in a blender can increase its glycemic index because of the breakdown of the fiber; I would wager that dehydrating the produce before blending it would destroy the fiber's usefulness even more thoroughly.\n\nCucurbita pepo, the species that includes pumpkins and other winter squash like butternuts, acorn squash, etc., is kind of a marvel of natural long-term storage. Although they're almost all harvested in mid-late fall, different varieties ripen throughout the year, such that you can eat nutritious fresh squash with peak nutritional value from October through May. My recommendation? Skip this laborious, nutrient-wrecking process, and store these beautiful pumpkins in a root cellar (or a similarly cool and dark place, like a wine cellar) until you want to get into them. Hell, even after you cut a pumpkin like this into big sections, you can store pieces of it in on a cool countertop for a few days, or in your fridge for a couple weeks. Sometimes the best thing to do is also the easiest and most straightforward.", "id": "dafz06u"}, {"comment": "Some of your points I agree with, and some not. Specifically, there are vitamins that will be lost through heat but since I don't eat raw pumpkins, it was going to be exposed to heat in cooking eventually. And some fiber stuff is lost through blending, but most of what I use pumpkins for is getting blended /pureed anyway. \n\nYou referenced the pale color as evidence that it's lost vitamins but I believe the color shift is an optics thing related to how light reflection works on flat vs, ground up surfaces and also how dryness changes the way light rays are bent. From the physics dept at the University of Illinois: \n\n\"The light blue cloth reflects a lot of the light that hits it. That's caused by the high index of refraction of the cloth. The reflected light of course can't get absorbed by the dye in the cloth. Water has an intermediate index of refraction, between air and many solid materials. That reduces the reflection, allowing more light to get to the dye where it's absorbed. The material looks darker. This seems particularly effective on porous materials, perhaps because much of the light is reflected at various angles several times before bouncing out. Water reduces the reflection at all the surfaces.\" https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=21080 \n\nI took a photo of the pumpkin that is in my blender this morning, comparing the dry sample to a rehydrated one from the same blender to show it's still as dark as regular mashed pumpkin: http://imgur.com/TdCFogI\n\nThe last issue is whether it's worth the time to do this. It depends on your budget vs. your windfall opportunities vs. time savings in bulk processing. Pumpkins this time of year are almost free at the store and definitely free on the street. I paid $2 for 50 pounds and winter squash typically costs about $1/pound around here, so that's a 2400% markup if I wait and buy them throughout the year. I did keep a chunk of the first one and cooked some in cubes for burritos and curries, which is why it's titled 20 lbs of food in the jar, not 25 - even though it's a 25lb pumpkin. But the pureed stuff - it's less work for me to cook and process it all at once than to cut off a half pound chunk today, bake it, deal with the food processor, clean that, and then repeat it all again tomorrow for a new meal. And the day after that for a smoothie.

If you buy a variety of winter squash, you probably only need to buy a bunch of them once, even if you're just keeping them unmolested in your pantry.

You might save on money just by changing where you shop.  \n  \nAlso, at Lidl, because nuts, seeds, dried fruit etc is cheaper, even though we spent less money on food and household goods, we actually ate better.  \n  \nAs you're in the UK, Home Bargains is even cheaper for other small things that you may want, so after finding out where does the cheapest shop overall, give Home Bargains a try for dried produce and little house hold items, toilet paper, chocolate, etc.  \n  \nAnother tip, buy a big glass bottle with a lid on it, fill this with tap water and use this when out and about in the car, walks, gym, before/after meals etc. Drinking plenty of water helps too.  \n  \nNot eating meat will save you a bit of money too.  \n  \nReplace cereal with porridge and jams/fruit and that will save a lot of money!

Grains like quinoa or couscous are cheap and can be added to salads. Eggs are cheap and versatile, and really great for bulking on muscles. Hummus is cheap and easy to make but it's loaded with protein and can be eaten on everything. Instead of cereal, Scottish oats make a filling breakfast. Making bread and English muffins and all your bread products from scratch is a lot cheaper than buying ready made, and then you have quality control - you can fill it with whole grain flour and added ingredients like oats and seeds, and olive oil rather than unhealthy fats like shortening (which is what they often use in storemade bread, at least here in Canada!).\n\nRegardless of what sort of exercise he's doing, the trick is to eat enough protein but cut down on the unhealthy fats (butter, cheese, the fat in red meat, etc.) and replace them with good ones. Avocado, olive oil, and the fats from things like fish are much better. Also make sure that sugar is a rarity or he will be undermining all his hard work. What he eats is as important to him as his exercise habits. \n\nOne of my favourite things to eat is two slices of whole-grain toast with sliced avocado, topped with one fried egg each, and a big salad on the side with avocado and olives, and a smoothie to drink. It's filling, it's quick, it's frugal, and really a great meal for bulking on muscle mass. For breakfast, I enjoy oatmeal with a glass of milk and some fruit. Again, cheap and easy but filling and healthy. Dinners often involve a smallish portion of meat, a carb of some kind (baked or boiled potatoes; a mix of white and brown rice; roasted sweet potatoes; sometimes toast if it's all I've got on hand), and then veggies on the side. I also like to make soups and stews, or pasta dishes with a sauce made out of pureed veggies (pumpkin is divine), or a casserole. My husband eats the same thing for lunch every day: homemade tortillas full of roasted spicy veggies. It's also a very frugal meal but seriously tasty. You can put potatoes and small bits of cooked meat in, too, to make them more filling, or slices of avocado to add more protein.\n\nBudgeting for food is hard and I hate it. lol We spend around $600 a month on food for a family of 4.

In a large bowl, mix salt and masa harina together.\n\n2. Pour 1\u00bd cups of hot water into the dough and mix with a spoon or your hand to form a big ball. The dough should be firm and springy when touched, not dry or super sticky. If you need some more water, add it in small amounts until dough is the right consistency.\n\n3. Cover the bowl with a cloth napkin and let the dough rest for about an hour.\n\n4. Preheat a griddle or large frying pan on medium-high heat.\n\n5. Pinch off a golf-ball sized piece of masa harina and form it into a ball by rolling it in a circular motion in the palm of your hand.\n\n6. Put the masa ball in between two pieces of parchment or wax paper and flatten it using the tortilla press.\n\n7. Gently remove the flattened masa from the parchment paper and cook on the hot griddle for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, depending on how hot the surface of the griddle is. You want the tortilla to have beautiful brown marks.\n\n8. Flip the tortilla over and cook on the other side for 30 seconds to about 1 minute. The tortilla may start to puff up in the middle, That's okay!\n\n9. Remove the tortilla and place it between a cloth napkin to keep it warm.

Racotumomab induced a human anti-(Neu5Gc)GM3 immune response, which correlated with longer median survival in non-small cell lung cancer (2). The first clinical trial result using racotumomab was actually published in 2002 (3). A phase III trial testing racotumomab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer began in 2011, and is currently recruiting (NCT01460472). These studies do not consider dietary Neu5Gc intake and incorporation as a variable that could affect (Neu5Gc)GM3 expression by human cancers.\n\n\nI cannot decipher (even with further research) what most of this relates to. I know the second article is about the involvement of gangliosides as anti-tumor targets, but that's about it. However the end of the criticism suggests these articles may \"not have seen Neu5Gc intake as a variable that could affect...human cancers\". However on reading those articles I saw no specific mention of Neu5Gc, the sialic acid in question with the article \"Involve of a Non-Human Sialic Acid in Human Cancer\". I'll provide links to the articles I was able to get more than just an abstract on.

PAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italy, 28 Dec. 2015. Web. 25 Feb. 2016.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4698595/)\n\n\n>As a conclusion, accumulated evidence of prospective epidemiological studies and their meta-analyses shows that **red meat and processed meat** convincingly **increases CRC risk by 20-30%**. Regarding specific red meat subtypes, the association with increased risk was found for beef consumption in two trials (one of them is weakly associated), for pork consumption in three trials and for lamb intake in one trial. An interesting observation is the existence of this risk only for pork intake and rectum cancer and lamb intake and colon cancer, respectively in one trial. Beef and pork consumption was found also to be associated with colon cancer only in women, in one trial. Whether CRC is one disease or the existence of 2 categories of CRC (colon and rectum or proximal and distal or right and left colon) and the link between etiologic factors and molecular subtypes are another hot topics of discussion, which need further investigations.\n\n\nThe above article was a meta-study, collecting information on the interaction of red meats and cancers, hence the talk of \"in one trial\" and so forth.\n\n\n[Yu, C. et al. At least two Fc Neu5Gc residues of monoclonal antibodies are required for binding to anti-Neu5Gc antibody. Sci. Rep. 6, 20029; doi: 10.1038/srep20029 (2016).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4731815/#b15)\n\n>It was documented that the consumption of Neu5Gc-containing red meat might induce the antigen-antibody immune complex related chronic inflammation and tumor progression17. The high titer of anti-Neu5Gc IgG is often accompanied by a high tire of high-affinity anti-Neu5Gc IgM in patients with hypothyroidism, which suggests that the immune complex-related immunologic reactions are induced by Neu5Gc in these patients\n\n\nExcerpt taken from the discussion page. The article in question states in the abstract that it seems mAbs (Monoclonal antibody therapy) with two or more binding Fcs induces an antibody generation such as the aforementioned \"xenosialitis\" in the first article and due to \"most Neu5Gc epitopes...distributed singly on the Fc of mAbs, [the] results suggest that the potential antigenicity of Fc Neu5Gc is low\". As a result, the cancerous results may be more apparent in some individuals (e.g. those with hypothyroidism) than others. \n\n\n\n[Ananthakrishnan, Ashwin N., Mengmeng Du, Sonja I.

As such there's a likelihood to red meat increasing colorectal cancer risk but it may not be the exact *trigger* for CRC developing.\n\n\nThe above article also does not mention whether the red meats in question were unprocessed, processed, or a combination of both (and if so, what was the ratio of the two in the patients' diets?), which I understand was your argument in the beginning (yes processed meats increase cancer risk, but unprocessed may not). However I would assume that the patients' diets included both processed and unprocessed.\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThere's a plethora of research out there but it seems that red meat in general is linked to an increased risk of developing colorectal cancers, whether that meat is processed or unprocessed. I did find *one* research article that talked about processed vs. unprocessed and *did* find that it seemed as though processed red meats had a higher CRC risk than unprocessed meats.\n\n\n[Ananthakrishnan, Ashwin N., Mengmeng Du, Sonja I.

Fuchs et al. \"Red Meat Intake, NAT2, and Risk of Colorectal Cancer: A Pooled Analysis of 11 Studies.\" *Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention : A Publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, Cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology*.

Web. 25 Feb. 2016.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4549221/)\n\n\n>Thus, in these two large cohorts of US health professionals, processed meat intake was positively associated with risk of CRC, particularly distal cancer, with little evidence that higher intake of unprocessed red meat substantially increased risk of CRC.\n\n\nExcerpt from abstract. It is important to mention, however, that this article seemed to be looking at CRC risk development on the basis of 1 serving of red meat per day. 1 serving was defined as:\n\n>To compare our results with earlier studies and account for variation in serving size across different types of red meat (e.g. a serving of a hot dog versus that of bacon), we examined CRC and subsite associations per **50g/day increment for processed red meat** and **100g and 120g/day for unprocessed red meat** [5]. Results were similar to those observed for per-serving-day increments\n\n\nAs a result for those who may eat higher amounts of red meat than 100-120 g of unprocessed red meat, the increased risk may still be there. Likewise the study did not account for doneness of meat, so Acrylamide (a carcinogenic compound produced when foods are burnt) formation was not evaluated in the study, as this may play a role in CRC risk development. It is important also to note that although unprocessed red meat seemed to have a lower CRC risk increase than processed meats, it was simply that it was not a *substantial* increase, not a non-existent increase. As such, the CRC risk seems to still be there, just at a lower percentage than processed red meats.\n\n\n------------------------\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThe jury is still out and further research is needed to verify results and to see if there were complications surrounding things like the lack of Acrylamide in most research papers (as most people cook red meats to a sear which generally creates some Acrylamide) and if that's fudging the results a bit. However current research seems to suggest that red meat in general *still* increases a risk of CRC development. The amount seems to be much higher with processed meats (largely due to the interactions of nitrates used for preservation) but unprocessed meats seem to still play a bit of a risk as well. That difference needs further research to verify what the gap between unprocessed and processed may be.

I added this in to the scrambled egg mixture)  \n  \n\nDirections:  \n1) Set a large skillet over medium heat and coat it with nonstick spray or a drizzle of olive oil. Add the peppers, mushrooms, spinach, onion, garlic, and a sprinkle each of salt and pepper. Begin stirring and cooking the veggies down until tender, about 6-8 minutes.  \n2) Generously grease a 9x13 baking pan. Break the bread into pieces and place in the pan in an even layer.  \n3)  In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, and 1/4 cup shredded cheese together. Pour half of this egg mixture over the bread. Top with the vegetables, then the remaining egg mixture and remaining 1/4 cup cheese. Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper on top.  \n4) Cover casserole with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight-- or up to 1 day. Allow it to come to room temperature before baking.  \n5) Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F (191\u00b0C). Bake the casserole, uncovered, until the top is golden, edges are crisp, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean-- about 40-45 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then slice and serve. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat in the microwave to your liking.  \n  \n  \nCost breakdown (ROUGH estimate. I am not sure the cost of ingredients I already had on hand):  \n- 3 bell peppers - $1.71 ($4.00 for a bag of 7. Only used 3.)  1 cup sliced mushrooms - $2.49  \n- 1bag (9 ounces) fresh spinach - $2.49  \n- 1 medium yellow onion, diced (I like onion, you could cut back on this if you wanted) - $1.27  \n- 1 teaspoon minced garlic - already had this  \n- Salt and fresh ground black pepper - already had this  \n- 3 slices bread I had in my fridge - again, already had this, so not sure\n- 8 large eggs - $0.66 (Got a dozen for $0.99)  \n- 1/8 - 1/4 cup milk (or just whatever looks right to you) - $0.07 (Got 8 cups for $2.55. Comes out to about 7 cents for a 1/4 cup)  \n- 1/4 cup shredded cheese - $0.64 ($2.50 for 8 ounces. Used 2 ounces.)  \n- Dash of ground mustard (This is totally optional. I've put it in other breakfast casseroles. Use it if you have it. Add it to the scrambled egg mixture before you pour in the basking dish) - Already had this spice. \n  \n\n  \nComes to about $9.33 total. I've cut into 4 (hefty) servings (breakfast M-Th), which is about $2.33/serving. I'm pretty pleased with that, especially for all the veggies I'll get.

Not trying to troll or anything, I know that animals are tasty, but, it is my firm belief, that if I go to a restaurant for example, and I order something veg, and it tastes like it is poorly prepared, does this mean that my friends that eat meat rely solely on the fact that the meat quality is good enough to overcome the efforts of a chef that doesn't know how to season any dish to make it good?\n\nI understand that not everyone can let go of eating meat for various reasons, but, I am curious what reasons you might have not to just try for say, I dunno, a couple of days? A week? \n\nTo put it into perspective, I still love me some cheese, but I find that if I eat dairy products for my calcium, instead of putting some fresh spinach on my food, if I eat a lot of cheese it sits in my stomach weird, gives me gas, makes me just feel lethargic in general, sort of like smoking a cigarette for me.\n\nFortunately I quit smoking almost 2 years ago, but, cheese, I mean it's so delicious. Meat is too. \n\nIs it cheap though? Not if I want good quality meat. Is it healthy? Well, compared to what? \n\nI'll share a sort of off topic anecdote too. I live in the US, and I was required by a previous employer to travel to India to train engineers. \n\nWe talked a lot about food, because I am quite endeared to Indian culture, and Indian food. Some of these engineers had been to the US, and they could not believe how much cheaper meat was here. \n\nAll of this while I was absolutely blissful eating extraordinarily cheap veg meals vs meat meals in India.\n\nI still haven't been able to find a restaurant or a recipe that recreates the tandoor vegetable recipe that I had at the company cafeteria there. It's like the holy fucking grail I'll never find for me. \n\nGive it a shot, a couple days, or a week, if your body can tolerate it.

Recipes often say \"cook until translucent or until raw smell goes away\" wtf does that even mean? What they mean is on medium heat, cook until almost caramelized. Controlling the heat is important because you can't let the onions brown or burn. Sometimes this takes a long time,  like 20 minutes sometimes. Then add ginger and garlic for a few minutes. Not long, just enough to cook the garlic maybe 5 minutes. \n\nToast your spices! Put spices in after the ginger and garlic are cooked and mix everything together and cook it together. You should smell them a lot. Be sure not to burn them though, then everything will be bitter. \n\nGaram Masala is a finishing spice. It should be added as one of the last ingredients. Probably with cream or kasoori methi if those are in the recipe.  It is already toasted before being ground so you can't cook it for too long. \n\nOften when the dish tastes a little *off but not bad*, you're missing either acid or sweet. Don't be afraid to use lemon juice, vinegar, or sugar. Take a spoon full, sprinkle a little, taste the difference. If that's it, then add it to the rest. This happens because the tomatoes and vegetables don't always have the exact same acidity or glucose levels every time. \n\nI'm sure some of this advice is a little off because I haven't been cooking Indian for too long, but I've been mildly obsessed with it and reading about it the past two years or so.

I'm extremely smart but barely making ends meet in a part-time paraprofessional job, I can't manage to make 3 meals a day on a regular basis, I leave a trail of unfinished projects in my wake, I'm a shitty friend because I forget to stay in touch with people, and I can't keep my living space tidy for than 2.5 seconds.  \n\n\nLiving with undiagnosed ADHD is like trying to fit a round peg into a square hole -- everyone else makes adulting look really easy so having so many problems with basic skills is *soooo* hard on your self-image and all the solutions that normal people present are aimed at normal people, so they don't always work with the ADHD brain.  So now you're in a position where you struggle to function as a normal adult, and even the \"tips\" and \"tricks\" and \"lifehacks\" that are supposed to make things easier don't work, but when you start to learn about ADHD, you finally start to realize that those solutions won't work for you because they aren't aimed at you!  It's like giving a blind person a bunch of tips about how to see better.  There are *other* solutions that work for people with ADHD, you just have to find them.\n\n\nSo yeah, for \"normal\" people, buying a tub of chopped onions instead of buying an onion and spending 30 seconds chopping it myself seems incredibly lazy.  But we have a very real mental condition, and something as insignificant as peeling or chopping or slicing food can be a monumental hurdle.  Paying someone else to do some of these tasks is an accommodation to your illness and it's okay to do it.  Should a guy whose legs got chopped off feel guilty about using a wheelchair?  No.  So why should someone who's got impaired executive functioning feel guilty about taking the accommodations they need to live?\n\n\nMy recommendation is to shop at the Newcastle Sobey's.

Leaving aside the nutritional value of food and its expense, living on a SANP budget means that you aren't just restricted by what you can purchase at the grocery store, your social life is restricted. Meals are thought of as this coming-together experience, but if you can't go out with friends or family, or if you can't afford to have them over or don't want them to know you live in such a way, it becomes limiting.

I will say that a lot of it is how much knowledge you have of nutrition and cooking. That makes a big difference in food quality. \n\nThen there are things I used to do, like checking the \"sell by\" dates on meat. Typically the meat dept makes up a large amount of chops/hamburger/chicken at a time. Most stores when it hits that sell by date will have a few left and will slap a 50% off or $2 off  or whatever sticker on it to move it off the shelf so they don't have to toss it. I would scoop these up and freeze them. I never bought boneless skinless anything. I broke everything down myself. \n\nAlso there are sales to get you in the door at stores. Like one week every 6 weeks or so will be chicken legs or thighs .99\u00a2 a pound, in fact right now my local store has leg quarters for .87\u00a2 a lb tomorrow between 11 am and 2 pm . I would buy all I could afford and bring it home, in the freezer it would go. Same with those $1.87 a pound pork chops. Oh and turkey at Thanksgiving stores will give you a turkey for .99\u00a2 a lb if you spend $25 so I would buy exactly $25 at one store then move on to the next store for the deal there, same with ham at Christmas etc. In fact what meat we don't get now from hunting or raising ourselves I still buy like this. There's a boar and 2 deer in our freezer from last fall/winter hunting and a few of our own chickens.\n\nOh and they mark down fresh veggies the same way at a lot of stores. If it starts to look a little unfresh they'll mark it down and if it's anything freezable I'd scoop that up too. \n\nBread freezes really well too. When they would have those buy one get one or 2 for $3 sales I'd buy what I could and toss that in the freezer. Without a freezer I'd have been so screwed! I didn't have a chest freezer back then though, just the one on my fridge. I would often wind up cooking the meat when I got home and shredding it if it was chicken or pork. Then I'd put it in a freezer bag and freeze it flat as I could. I'd use it in fajitas, BBQ, or chopped up for casseroles. It was all about maximum use of the space I had.

Not to mention there is no talk of median wages but rather basic wages (or as most refer to it minimum wage). The median wage has been doing fine, [considering the USA median wage is over $51,000](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=us%20median%20wage). Minimum wage is just over [$15,000 a year](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=us+minimum+wage+yearly+income). That is almost triple the wage.\n\nSo now that we are on the same page, lets go over the rest of it.\n\n> At the moment, a large portion of the companies that employ unskilled laborers are being subsidized by government programs. There's a reason an exceptionally high percentage of minimum wage workers rely on government aid to get by.\n\nCausation does not mean correlation. Large companies get subsidized (they get tax breaks, meaning they do not have to pay the government more money) because they hire more people than small businesses. They also have higher credit rating meaning they are more likely to pay on their debts. They also buy much more and employ more services from the local communities. We can act like big businesses are the bad guys all day long but at the end of the day, they employ more people, and pump more money into the economy than small or medium size businesses could ever do.\n\n> There's a reason an exceptionally high percentage of minimum wage workers rely on government aid to get by.\n\nMind giving a sourced reason? Because to me it sounds like you are trying to point a finger saying people should just work a single unskilled job and be living like those that have a skill (but I could be misinterpreting what you are trying to say).\n\n> Now tell me: why is it an obligation of tax payers to subsidize the labor costs for multi-billion dollar companies, but (according to you) it is not the obligation of these same companies to pay their employees a livable wage?\n\nTwo things: First tax payers have nothing to do with this. Actually follow how taxes are done and what it really means. This might be a cause of all of your heart ache. Secondly, there is a huge difference in a \"livable wage\" and minimum wage. Lets get off of the buzz words that mean nothing and cause confusion. It is not on the government to enforce a wage that allows people to have a standard of living. You as a person need to take accountablity for your life and do what needs to be done to live in your comfort zone. You want a pricey smart phone and a big screen TV? Better get a better job. Don't have a skill that a company is willing to pay you more for? Better find one through schooling (technical or otherwise) or work a couple jobs simultaneously. But people don't want to hear that. They don't want to hear they need to work harder.\n\nAnd according to me, I said the basic wage should always be above the inflation line, this gives everyone a bare basic fall line to make it day to day.\n\n> Aside from that, I'd like you to justify why every individual is obligated to earn a living in the way you're suggesting -- \"that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist.\"\n\nLMAO - no one said this. It was never implied... but good on you for twisting my words and building a straw-man argument to attack. LEts just skip that section.\n\n> Fuck that. This isn't 1424. It's 2016 and there's an exceptional amount of technological progress that's been made, allowing for the production of an extreme surplus of wealth, food, and resources.\n\nExactly, so there is zero excuses on why you cannot find multiple jobs or find the resources to obtain a better skill that the market finds desirable. Far more than enough for every single person on this planet.\n\n> Under what ethical theory are you operating where people must justify their right to merely survive by busting their ass at some bullshit 9-5, fully aware that we already have enough to go around?\n\nFunny thing about ethics... everyone has their own. Also what is funny is that you are trying to apply ethics to a conversation about work ethic with comments like \"bullshit 9-5\", \"enough to go around\". Clearly you just want yours and do not want to work for it. But fuck the guy that took the huge risk and actually succeed.\n\n> But lose the fucking ego.\n\nNo, fuck that. I earned it. I busted my ass and I am proud to have made it through the gauntlet. What have you done with your life? \n\n> Do you truly believe that laziness is the reason the bulk of people who find themselves in poverty never make it out?\n\nWhere did I ever say that? Better yet where did I imply it because I would like to clarify that no where ever did I say anything about laziness. Do people find themselves on hard times? Of course they do. Do people continue struggling even though they try every day? Of course they do. Does that mean they should just give up and expect some one to fix all of their problems because \"there are plenty to go around\"? No, not at all.\n\n> You genuinely believe it's that black and white? \n\nRhetorical question.\n\n>  That there aren't extreme complexities for why the cycle of poverty continues from generation to generation?\n\nRepeated rhetorical question.\n\n> To you, it is absolutely nothing more than a lack of desire? \n\nAlready answered this above.\n\n>  There couldn't possibly be worthy criticism of a system that makes a person who does exit the poverty cycle a statistical anomaly?\n\nOh now you are getting somewhere!

I left all my resources except for ID, some clothes and $25 at home. For 33 days, I had to figure out how to feed myself, shower, do laundry and have a place to sleep. I gave my car to a friend to use, and had no means of transportation at hand.\n\nI came to understand how many places there are where you can get a night or two if you are clever, and how hard it is to find a place to sleep repeatedly. Occasionally, like some of the people I knew, I stayed on a friend's couch, in friends' offices and in out of the way corners where I could blend in for hours at a time on a local university campus. I walked almost 40 minutes in the cool, dark morning to get to work at my white collar job without breaking a sweat, and then after work, walked back almost 2 miles to reach the free fare zone for the local bus system. \n\nI also came to understand how hard it was to carry heavy food around, especially if it wasn't for that day's meals.

Spaghetti, tacos, and stuffed bell peppers, and meatloaf are my standard for Ground beef. I usually have one of those a week. I love spaghetti, because all the ingredients can be purchased once and used 2+ times (1/3 box of noodles, 1/3 can of sauce, 1/2 lb ground beef). I sometimes purchase mushrooms, and yes, I buy the cheap grated mozzarella.\n\nChicken: Bone in thighs and drumsticks I usually put salt, pepper, cracked red pepper, garlic and make a bit of a rub. Kroger now sales prepackaged \"roasting\" veggies. I'll drizzle the veggies and chicken (post rub) with olive oil, add salt and pepper to the veggies (garlic if I'm using red potatoes as well) and roast at 325 for about 40 minutes, or until the chicken is done. That's usually a good two meals for me.\n\nGrilling chicken tenders or breast fillet (I cut them to 2 inch strips) and searing a bag of frozen veggies on the stove top is another one. A little different flavor, and yoi can add soy sauce to the vegetables and a pack of knorr rice sides (those are usually $1!) And it's so yummy.\n\nAlso on chicken, my favorite meal growing up was just a chicken and rice. Boiled chicken breasts until done, season with salt and pepper. Remove from the pot, add rice and cool until fluffy. Shred the chicken and add it to the rice. I've also added peas in to the mix.\n(I don't measure a whole lot when making any of these!

I've also added beef bouillon cubes for extra flavor (being careful, though, it can make it super salty).\n\nBeef tips: Saute onions in oil. Brown beef tips on high. Once browned, pour over 1.5 cups of water about about 1/4 each soy and Worcestershire sauce. And garlic, salt and pepper and stir. Bring to a boil, then simmer for about an hour, hour and a half. I use a gravy mix and add another cup or less of water (again, I just kind of eyeball it.. Sorry :/), stir it into the meat and bring to a boil again.  Another rice dish.. Sorry!\n\nI have a Cuisinart Griddled and grill a lot of things on it. Marinated chicken thighs grilled. When removed, I add asparagus lightly salted, and usually have a baked potato with it. \n\nI just realized I kind of piece things together. I plan, somewhat, but based on what I know I can make by heart and easily.

I will say that a lot of it is how much knowledge you have of nutrition and cooking.

Typically the meat dept makes up a large amount of chops/hamburger/chicken at a time. Most stores when it hits that sell by date will have a few left and will slap a 50% off or $2 off  or whatever sticker on it to move it off the shelf so they don't have to toss it.

Like one week every 6 weeks or so will be chicken legs or thighs .99\u00a2 a pound, in fact right now my local store has leg quarters for .87\u00a2 a lb tomorrow between 11 am and 2 pm . I would buy all I could afford and bring it home, in the freezer it would go. Same with those $1.87 a pound pork chops.

There's a boar and 2 deer in our freezer from last fall/winter hunting and a few of our own chickens.\n\nOh and they mark down fresh veggies the same way at a lot of stores. If it starts to look a little unfresh they'll mark it down and if it's anything freezable I'd scoop that up too. \n\nBread freezes really well too. When they would have those buy one get one or 2 for $3 sales I'd buy what I could and toss that in the freezer. Without a freezer I'd have been so screwed! I didn't have a chest freezer back then though, just the one on my fridge. I would often wind up cooking the meat when I got home and shredding it if it was chicken or pork.

So I'll get veggies, use half in the stir-fry, freeze half of that, and then try and figure out what to do with the rest of them. Anyway I could organize or better plan out what to get would be a lifesaver!\n\n-Multi-meal ingredients. Kind of piggy-backing on my last point, but it's just me and the bf. We won't use an entire cucumber/onion/tomato/etc. for a meal (unless we're going to freeze part of it) so now what? I hate throwing away food because it's gone bad.\n\n-Variety!! Like I said, I've been eating (way too much) stir-fry. Getting some variety in and having options for low-sodium, low-carb, vegetarian, etc. would be awesome. I think that's where you would be the most successful. Most sites seem to \"specialize\" in something, but if you can open it up to everyone you're going to be able to tap in to a huge user base.\n\nAlso, as a side-note, my bf just got a new kidney (woo-hoo!) but he was a dialysis patient for 3 years.

I put the fried rice in quotes, because I prefer my rice soft and I just flavor it. Start with your rice and chicken, take a bag of frozen vegetables (peas or other mix), cook and mix with the rice. Season with soy sauce, ginger, and garlic. If you have eggs on hand, add a scrambled egg. Ta-da.\n\n* 3 Chicken 'casserole.' Same ingredients, different seasoning. Mix your mixed vegetables in with the rice, chop your chicken. Make a basic white sauce, heavy on the pepper. (I can't have dairy, so I make my own white sauces.) It comes out like the interior of a chicken pot pie, but if you're in control of the sauce, you're in control of the calories. Ta-da.\n\n* 4, 5 Italian chicken. If you have Italian dressing, mix your rice, chicken, and vegetables with some of that. It gives a nice flavor to the same mix of ingredients. If you're tired of rice-based dishes, this also works with pasta.\n\n* 6,7 Chicken cacciatore - Add a basic red-sauce to your chicken with some italian seasoning. Serve over rice. If you're tired of rice-based dishes, this works over pasta as well. I add frozen vegetables just to have green in my 'spaghetti diet'\n\nOh, I haven't used the black beans yet, have I? Let's take it Tex-mex. \n\n* 8 Chicken burrito bowl. With a little chili powder, cayenne pepper, and cumin, you can make a great burrito seasoning for your chicken. Mix with the rice and beans. If it's not tomato season, add salsa. Warm up some frozen corn to round out the flavors. Depending on your finances, you can add flavors from here (cheese, avocado, lettuce, burrito shell etc.)\n\n* 9 Chicken salad - eliminate the rice/pasta. Give yourself a green base like spinach, throw the chicken in. Salsa makes a great low-cal substitute for salad dressing. \n\n* 10 Chicken potato - Okay, now I'm reaching because I want 10, but this is one of my favorites. Baked potato. Chicken. Diced tomato. Barbecue sauce. Mmmm. (Cheese if you're into that.)\n\nAnd that's 10 things I do with chicken. Oh, I didn't mention chicken curry. Or buffalo chicken.

Smoked sausage is not expensive! Relatively, I guess. \n\nAnother is pasta with those specialty noodles. Like spaghetti made out of wheat or rice or something, kinda varies.

These are seasonings that can be bought in large quantities for relatively low prices, and will last you for ages. I mean like months. If you don't have them, aim to spend an extra $2-5 each time you go to the grocery store to add them to your collection. Spice is everything. He who controls the spice, controls the world.\n\nPrep:  \nPut the frozen chicken thighs into a large pot of **salted** boiling water to poach. Chop the onion and the celery and sweat them in a large, separate pot on a medium temperature with the pepper, a generous dash of **olive oil** and about a tablespoon of **garlic powder** (or other garlic - crushed, pasted, whatever). When the vegetables have softened, add the okra and continue to stir. The okra will soften and glue together. Add the following herbs/spices in order of priority, and according to your tastes: **chili powder, thyme, black pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, bay leaves**. (For a baseline, I use about 1-2 tbsp of chili powder.) Add the can of tomatoes and let simmer. While the soup simmers, remove the poached chicken from the water and skin & chop 2-3 thighs into bite-sized pieces. You'll have more chicken than you need, so put however many aside for later. Save the water - it should now be a delicious chicken-stock. Slice the sausage into bite-sized pieces. Add the sausage and the meat to the soup and continue to simmer. Add about a cup of the chicken stock to the soup. cover and let simmer on a low-to-medium heat for as long as you can stand. the longer it simmers, the better it will taste. I give it at least 20 mins on a low heat. Go watch an episode of whatever. Come back and taste it. How is it? Does it need **hot sauce**? **Salt**? adjust flavour to your liking. Often a small amount of **sugar** can improve things.  \n\nMakes about 6-10 bowls.

Here's my mental checklist for a favorite meal:\n\n**Gumbo:**\nBag frozen okra ($2-4 by size)  \nBag frozen chopped peppers ($2-4 by size)  \nCelery bunch ($1-2)  \nLarge Onion ($0.50-1)  \nLarge can diced tomatoes ($1-2)  \nFrozen Chicken Thighs, Skin+Bone on ($3.99)  \nSmoked sausage ($2-3)  \n  \nThe prep method (below) contains some ingredients that I've **emboldened**. These are seasonings that can be bought in large quantities for relatively low prices, and will last you for ages. I mean like months. If you don't have them, aim to spend an extra $2-5 each time you go to the grocery store to add them to your collection. Spice is everything. He who controls the spice, controls the world.\n\nPrep:  \nPut the frozen chicken thighs into a large pot of **salted** boiling water to poach. Chop the onion and the celery and sweat them in a large, separate pot on a medium temperature with the pepper, a generous dash of **olive oil** and about a tablespoon of **garlic powder** (or other garlic - crushed, pasted, whatever). When the vegetables have softened, add the okra and continue to stir. The okra will soften and glue together. Add the following herbs/spices in order of priority, and according to your tastes: **chili powder, thyme, black pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, bay leaves**. (For a baseline, I use about 1-2 tbsp of chili powder.) Add the can of tomatoes and let simmer. While the soup simmers, remove the poached chicken from the water and skin & chop 2-3 thighs into bite-sized pieces. You'll have more chicken than you need, so put however many aside for later. Save the water - it should now be a delicious chicken-stock. Slice the sausage into bite-sized pieces. Add the sausage and the meat to the soup and continue to simmer. Add about a cup of the chicken stock to the soup. cover and let simmer on a low-to-medium heat for as long as you can stand. the longer it simmers, the better it will taste. I give it at least 20 mins on a low heat. Go watch an episode of whatever. Come back and taste it. How is it? Does it need **hot sauce**? **Salt**? adjust flavour to your liking. Often a small amount of **sugar** can improve things.  \n\nMakes about 6-10 bowls. Serve over rice to stretch your supply, or because you like rice.  \n\nWhen I shop, I think of the meals I want to make for the week, and calculate what I can afford for under $100.

So in a perfect world, this should not be a problem. But none of us are perfect and neither are our pans. No matter how well you season, there's still a good chance that there are spots of bare metal and these can indeed interact with acidic ingredients in your food.\n\nFor this reason, it's a good idea to avoid long-simmered acidic things, particularly tomato sauce. On the other hand, a little acid is not going to hurt it. I deglaze my pan with wine after pan-roasting chicken all the time. A short simmer won't harm your food, your pan, or your health in any way.\"\n\nFrom [The Truth About Cast Iron](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/the-truth-about-cast-iron.html).

Coat the mug.in oil, crack egg, scramble. Microwave in ten to thirty second intervals until done."], [169, "I'm a very frugal mom on a limited income with two dependent adult sons.  For myself and family,  when I traveled on contract for a registery, for up to 13 weeks at a time, I was living in hotels and my  sons kept my home occupied for me while i was gone and watched my dogs..  and while neither really cooked much more than survival meals- pre-packaged convenience foods or spaghetti and meatsauce out of a jar...  I would make multiple recipes of pre-made meals in a jar(or baggie) on the weekend before I travelled.  Insuring we had dozens of meals to chose from at about 400 calories per meal.... \n   This is not difficult but does require you wrap your mind around the idea of not using fresh produce but using multiple dehydrated products and combining them into separate jars to make a soup or pasta enough for three people to have a meal by simply adding hot water.  This is genius for travelers and single people as my soup bases have multiple uses in crockpot cooking or when one was on the road and used a thermos as I did to hold my hot meals for the day (I could barely afford the gas to travel and never had enough money for for crappy high calorie food.) While on the road I'd fill up my thermos with 16 to 20 oz of hot water from a fast food place along with getting a cup of coffee, or nuked filtered water to put into the theros, then added a bag of ingredients to the thermos, stirred and let it sit until lunch time which made me at least two to three  hot meals for the day, depending on how hungry I was.   Unfortunately I no longer own that thermos (it plugged into the cigarette holder to keep food hot.)    \nNow that I'm no longer traveling, I still make up my own recipes and set into jars. On MOnday this week I made a new cream soup base using dehydrated chicken bouillon, dehydrated diced chicken breast, dried milk, dried butter, a few dried spices home grown,  diced onion, garlic powder, macaroni shells, corn starch and potato flakes to make an incredibly tasty cream base.   The longer it sits in water, the better it tastes!   I can add more dehydrated chicken or powdered veggie mix if needed.  ( when using dehydrated foods in a recipe - reduce the portion sizes by 80% for the recipe value - or example with the recipe calling for 2 cups of whole fresh milk you reduce it down to 1.6 cups dehydrated milk.)  \n   MOst American's no longer cook from scratch as i still do, and even  I had to wrap my head around the idea of using dehydrated milk and butter to make a soup!  \n    IF one makes up a liquid base in advance  you'll have to risk either storing it in the fridge or can it...   For those of us with the ability to either dehydrate our own supplies or just buy food dehydrated on line, and have a stocked pantry with a bunch of canned, long life emergency foods (like for prepping) with dehydrated dairy and proteins, and able to make up a big batch recipe to split into a dozen jars (this splits the cost of food across multiple meals for multiple people) and helps by just being able to just add water as both a survival tip and a major time saver.  My sons usually work with me while I'm making up my big batch recipes and help by putting the dried ingredients into individual jars and bags while I make up a computerized label for the jar with any special changes to the recipe as listed.  With these recipes I can also add one extra  cup of mix to each jar to increase or extend the soup thickness and individually we usually only cook these in a one quart pot on the stove or nuke three cups of water until boiling.   this Monday's batch had an investment of about about $15.00 worth of products to make a dozen jars of soup or 18 pints if I had to make it all up at  once... .. around 42 cents a meal per person.  On Tuesday we actually and ate the first jar of this new recipe and  I added a side of garlic bread(homemade using my own garlic infused butter on a homemade hard crust  bread) and a salad (from greens grown in my garden!)  \n  When my sons go hunting with their uncles, they will  take along a jar of my mix  and a loaf of bread so all can share around the campfire.   I also send them home with bags of my mixes for their own families to have.   The mason jars I use are only 16 oz's, so they can't add water to the jar, and have to spoon ingredients into each person's mug or mix it all in a pot with enough water for soup for everybody.   They'll usually field dress whatever they shot or caught and add it to the soup.    \n There are all kinds of recipes that only require use of readily available items for those of us who don't use dehydrated foods for a pantry or prep like I now do.   Even with prepping I still like to rotate item on the shelf, and replace with new stock as needed.   I still make homemade instant rice (learning how on YouTube) make  dried onion, and boil potatoes to a puree to then dehydrate into flakes.  I also make homemade sweet bell pepper flakes, and hamburger jerky  the same way. \n  We also home-make mexican taco spices at home - I'm so frugal I won't buy the premixed stuff.      \n They key is:  One merely assembles dry ingredients in a jar, or a zip lock baggy,  and set aside until needed.  These big batch recipes can be made up in minutes.  A good resource is online or in  the \"Dinner is in the jar\" book by Kathy Clark ( i have no selling interest in this book, only referencing it for information.)   IF making bean soup, you store the bean separately and before making the soup you have to cook the beans first following regular bean making guidelines by letting them soak overnight  in water, rinse and put into a pot of hot water and boil for 20 min's, then reduce for 2 hours to finish the beans before adding into the recipe.  IF you plan for long term storage as i do, one adds an oxygen absorber and makes sure the jars are sterile before adding ingredients (my jar lids also have a burping valve so as I can hand pump any excess air out of the jar.)    I will also store my recipes in food saver vacuum bags when I've run out of jars. \n The cool thing about making these prepared soup base recipes is one can add other products to them as desired to make whatever kind of soup you want in a crockpot early in the morning to have it ready for when you get home.  Or nuke the water in the microwave and then add ingredients, stir,  and let sit covered  to ensure it is thoroughly liquid and mixed before serving (any pasta in the mix  has to have time to absorb liquid and double in size before ready to eat.) \n  My eldest son will heat water on the stove and adds ingredients until it boils and swears it tastes better and the recipe more fully  developed his way.  My yuoungest like to scoop in three tablespoons into a mug and add hot water to it and will let it sit simmering for 15 minutes.   \n   Have you tried any mug mix deserts? I add together chocolate cake and angle food cake mixes 50/50  into one container (must both be an \"add only water\" mix for this to work.)  and one then scoops out two tablespoons into a mug and then adds water - two teaspoons usually is enough, stir until it is pancake thick, and then nuke for 70-90 seconds (depending on wattage of your machine) so you end up with a single one person serving size mug of cake.  Since chocolate is serious business, we use Devils food cake and Angle food mixed together.    My sons usually have one for breakfast in the morning instead of real food and we leave the mix  container ( a #10 size can with it's own plastic lid) on top of the microwave for fast access.   Or they'll have it  for desert at night with a scoop of ice cream.  There are so many recipes for mug cake on the internet to try out.  These are not really healthy, but it's nice to have it on hand when one is craving chocolate!   As I said, Chocolate is very serious business -  and must be respected and appreciated no matter it's form. \n "], [133, "Fresh bread from the bakery and hard salami, cucumber, and tomatoes.

I just use regular taco size flour tortillas (buy em from a Mexican market for best flavor *and* best value!) but you can use the big burrito sized wraps, tortillas, etc.\n\nAdd fresh veg of your choosing and some kind of simple dressing.  My preference is cucumbers, onions, sweet peppers (can be spicy, or can be something mild like orange, red, or yellow bell peppers/capsicums), and some matchstick carrots.  Cabbage or especially non-mayo coleslaw also works *wonderfully.*\n\nIf you use a non-mayo (or a mayo-based, though it's less healthy) coleslaw, you won't even need dressing.  If you don't, a simple vinaigrette works beautifully.  Kraft makes a lime vinaigrette that works great (60 kcal/serving), or you can make your own by combining lime juice, a neutral oil, a mild vinegar (such as white wine or rice wine), and seasonings of your choice (garlic, chili powder, cumin, etc) and whisking it until it emulsifies.\n\nAdd your veg in whatever proportions you like, drizzle a little dressing over them, and eat.  It's quick, it's easy, it doesn't require anything (not even refrigeration, though I think it tastes better when all the veg is chilled) special, and it'll keep the hunger pangs away until you can get something more substantial in your belly.  It's also fairly low calorie (most of the calories will come from the tortillas, so you can omit those and just eat it as a diced fresh \"salad\" if you have the utensils for it) and relatively high nutrition (mostly vitamin C and vitamin A, along with a smattering of other micronutrients.)\n\nIt's worth noting that cucumber doesn't have much nutritional value, but in this case I feel it's a positive - it takes up space (and tastes great), which helps you keep those hunger pangs away, making you less likely to end up getting a bag of Doritos or whatever instead.  I'm not sure what other veg you could substitute for the cukes.  You could try substituting actual fruit, too.

For myself and family,  when I traveled on contract for a registery, for up to 13 weeks at a time, I was living in hotels and my  sons kept my home occupied for me while i was gone and watched my dogs..  and while neither really cooked much more than survival meals- pre-packaged convenience foods or spaghetti and meatsauce out of a jar...  I would make multiple recipes of pre-made meals in a jar(or baggie) on the weekend before I travelled.  Insuring we had dozens of meals to chose from at about 400 calories per meal.... \n   This is not difficult but does require you wrap your mind around the idea of not using fresh produce but using multiple dehydrated products and combining them into separate jars to make a soup or pasta enough for three people to have a meal by simply adding hot water.  This is genius for travelers and single people as my soup bases have multiple uses in crockpot cooking or when one was on the road and used a thermos as I did to hold my hot meals for the day (I could barely afford the gas to travel and never had enough money for for crappy high calorie food.) While on the road I'd fill up my thermos with 16 to 20 oz of hot water from a fast food place along with getting a cup of coffee, or nuked filtered water to put into the theros, then added a bag of ingredients to the thermos, stirred and let it sit until lunch time which made me at least two to three  hot meals for the day, depending on how hungry I was.   Unfortunately I no longer own that thermos (it plugged into the cigarette holder to keep food hot.)    \nNow that I'm no longer traveling, I still make up my own recipes and set into jars. On MOnday this week I made a new cream soup base using dehydrated chicken bouillon, dehydrated diced chicken breast, dried milk, dried butter, a few dried spices home grown,  diced onion, garlic powder, macaroni shells, corn starch and potato flakes to make an incredibly tasty cream base.   The longer it sits in water, the better it tastes!   I can add more dehydrated chicken or powdered veggie mix if needed.  ( when using dehydrated foods in a recipe - reduce the portion sizes by 80% for the recipe value - or example with the recipe calling for 2 cups of whole fresh milk you reduce it down to 1.6 cups dehydrated milk.)  \n   MOst American's no longer cook from scratch as i still do, and even  I had to wrap my head around the idea of using dehydrated milk and butter to make a soup!  \n    IF one makes up a liquid base in advance  you'll have to risk either storing it in the fridge or can it...   For those of us with the ability to either dehydrate our own supplies or just buy food dehydrated on line, and have a stocked pantry with a bunch of canned, long life emergency foods (like for prepping) with dehydrated dairy and proteins, and able to make up a big batch recipe to split into a dozen jars (this splits the cost of food across multiple meals for multiple people) and helps by just being able to just add water as both a survival tip and a major time saver.  My sons usually work with me while I'm making up my big batch recipes and help by putting the dried ingredients into individual jars and bags while I make up a computerized label for the jar with any special changes to the recipe as listed.  With these recipes I can also add one extra  cup of mix to each jar to increase or extend the soup thickness and individually we usually only cook these in a one quart pot on the stove or nuke three cups of water until boiling.   this Monday's batch had an investment of about about $15.00 worth of products to make a dozen jars of soup or 18 pints if I had to make it all up at  once... .. around 42 cents a meal per person.  On Tuesday we actually and ate the first jar of this new recipe and  I added a side of garlic bread(homemade using my own garlic infused butter on a homemade hard crust  bread) and a salad (from greens grown in my garden!)  \n  When my sons go hunting with their uncles, they will  take along a jar of my mix  and a loaf of bread so all can share around the campfire.   I also send them home with bags of my mixes for their own families to have.   The mason jars I use are only 16 oz's, so they can't add water to the jar, and have to spoon ingredients into each person's mug or mix it all in a pot with enough water for soup for everybody.   They'll usually field dress whatever they shot or caught and add it to the soup.    \n There are all kinds of recipes that only require use of readily available items for those of us who don't use dehydrated foods for a pantry or prep like I now do.   Even with prepping I still like to rotate item on the shelf, and replace with new stock as needed.   I still make homemade instant rice (learning how on YouTube) make  dried onion, and boil potatoes to a puree to then dehydrate into flakes.  I also make homemade sweet bell pepper flakes, and hamburger jerky  the same way. \n  We also home-make mexican taco spices at home - I'm so frugal I won't buy the premixed stuff.      \n They key is:  One merely assembles dry ingredients in a jar, or a zip lock baggy,  and set aside until needed.  These big batch recipes can be made up in minutes.  A good resource is online or in  the \"Dinner is in the jar\" book by Kathy Clark ( i have no selling interest in this book, only referencing it for information.)   IF making bean soup, you store the bean separately and before making the soup you have to cook the beans first following regular bean making guidelines by letting them soak overnight  in water, rinse and put into a pot of hot water and boil for 20 min's, then reduce for 2 hours to finish the beans before adding into the recipe.  IF you plan for long term storage as i do, one adds an oxygen absorber and makes sure the jars are sterile before adding ingredients (my jar lids also have a burping valve so as I can hand pump any excess air out of the jar.)    I will also store my recipes in food saver vacuum bags when I've run out of jars. \n The cool thing about making these prepared soup base recipes is one can add other products to them as desired to make whatever kind of soup you want in a crockpot early in the morning to have it ready for when you get home.  Or nuke the water in the microwave and then add ingredients, stir,  and let sit covered  to ensure it is thoroughly liquid and mixed before serving (any pasta in the mix  has to have time to absorb liquid and double in size before ready to eat.) \n  My eldest son will heat water on the stove and adds ingredients until it boils and swears it tastes better and the recipe more fully  developed his way.  My yuoungest like to scoop in three tablespoons into a mug and add hot water to it and will let it sit simmering for 15 minutes.   \n   Have you tried any mug mix deserts? I add together chocolate cake and angle food cake mixes 50/50  into one container (must both be an \"add only water\" mix for this to work.)  and one then scoops out two tablespoons into a mug and then adds water - two teaspoons usually is enough, stir until it is pancake thick, and then nuke for 70-90 seconds (depending on wattage of your machine) so you end up with a single one person serving size mug of cake.  Since chocolate is serious business, we use Devils food cake and Angle food mixed together.    My sons usually have one for breakfast in the morning instead of real food and we leave the mix  container ( a #10 size can with it's own plastic lid) on top of the microwave for fast access.   Or they'll have it  for desert at night with a scoop of ice cream.  There are so many recipes for mug cake on the internet to try out.  These are not really healthy, but it's nice to have it on hand when one is craving chocolate!   As I said, Chocolate is very serious business -  and must be respected and appreciated no matter it's form. \n ", "id": "d4d65ta"}, {"comment": "Wow. This is amazing. Thank you!", "id": "d7062ji"}, {"comment": "Amazing! Where do you get your dehydrated ingredients online?", "id": "d8ir0z2"}, {"comment": "I started with a search online for Dehydrated Food, Bulk and went from there looking for the same on Amazon.  I like Wise Foods, Bob's Red Mill, Honeyville Grain among others (but be careful, once they have your email you can expect a lot of attempts to sell you on big survival food packages for preppers.)   A lot of stuff I get lasts me a very long time.  However, that being said I also dehydrate food myself and learned how to pressure can food for long term storage as well... today I packed up 3 quarts of spaghetti sauce with meat and a half dozen sterile filtered water jars (pressure canned from  water I'd  filtered in reverse osmosis  for long term storage )   I am making sterile water and canning it now simply because I don't like the plastic bottles water comes in and wanted a supply of sterilized water on hand: plus I don't' want to pay for it so I did it myself at home.  I have so many canning jars, it make good financial sense to just use them instead of buying water in plastic containers.    Today I made up a vast quantity of dry soup powder that in turn will make about 17 gallons of chicken soup, I just store part of it in jars, and left the majority of it in a Tupperware container in my pantry for every day use....  using dehydrated milk, potato starch, dehydrated diced chicken, lentils (which I had on hand,)  and Texturized Vegetable protein ( or TVP made from soy.) (I had to do some math to figure out if it was cheaper to make my own dehydrated hamburger meat or diced chicken or buy it done - the end result was it was cheaper to just buy it finished as they are now using freeze drying machines and it's cheaper and tastier and last longer: the problem with animal products is they can go rancid very fast int he presence of moisture.)  After it is mixed, one just scoops out one cup of the mix and adds it to one or two cups of boiling water( depending on how thick you want it) and let it simmer for 10 min's before eating with hard tack or a hard roll of bread  (tack is dried out bread similar to a thick dry cracker - kind of chewy but will last you a good long time..... it's nice to have when all you carry is some jerky of some kind when back packing.) \n\nI get my nuts and grains at Amazon, always looking for a deal! \n\n   Using  dehydrate ingredients and storing in a jar or a mylar pouch makes clean up a breeze.   I got my recipes from online - check out YouTube for \"Dinner in a jar\" or Mix-a-meal for ideas.  Both books available thru Amazon. \n     After I responded last time I realized that since you may not have access to a fridge you might not have access to a stove or oven either.    An electric cooker /canner might fill the bill for you as well:  check out the electric pressure cooker called Elite Platinum.   It looks like a more modern crock pot but is much more versatile.   PLus lots of recipes on YouTube.   \nA pressure cooker is  a very fast way to cook food, easy to use and when cooking this way I save a lot of money (it's fast - I make boiled eggs in 6 min's rather than in 20 min's on the stove!)    That's 14 min's of my day saved and 14 min's saved off my electric bill - give that some thought!  My cooker make a mean fried rice meal!  I like to brown chicken in it, add some chicken stock, bake it a bit, then remove the chicken and add in rice and mixed veggies to cook for 10 min's under pressure - and while it's cooking I dice up the chicken and toss it back in when the rice is done, along with a egg.   This is one of my favorite recipe video's:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JljAIMLWKk          \n    There are so many meals that come prepared in a box that are almost ready to eat when you just add hot water like the  Knorr Side Dishes made of noodles (these you can assemble these yourself once you know what ingredients to add - Knorr uses dehydrated butter, and Sea Salt for their ingredients so it's easy to imitate. )        .. if you can't buy it, you can dehydrate it yourself.   \n\n    My sons love to make apple sauce fruit roll ups in my dehydrator, and I'll also make other things like dehydrated pork and beans for them the same way - it's almost like eating candied beans with bacon in it.  \n\nGood luck to you, there are so many companies out there selling dehydrate foods.   They also sell complete meals to make up:   Look for American made and do the math for yourself when choosing - find the cheapest product per unit measurement when buying.     Things like beef are going to be expensive, but when used wisely the cost is cheaper than buying fresh.   Mountain house is expensive but tastes decent. Look up Back packing food for additional ideas on the web.  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=backpacking+food+recipes\n     \n      ", "id": "d8izwus"}, {"comment": "Wow.

I often wouldn't get to check in at a hotel before work on a Monday, so the food would travel with me from home to work (several hours), go into the work fridge still in the tote (we had industrial-sized fridges) and then to the hotel.

I just use regular taco size flour tortillas (buy em from a Mexican market for best flavor *and* best value!) but you can use the big burrito sized wraps, tortillas, etc.\n\nAdd fresh veg of your choosing and some kind of simple dressing.  My preference is cucumbers, onions, sweet peppers (can be spicy, or can be something mild like orange, red, or yellow bell peppers/capsicums), and some matchstick carrots.  Cabbage or especially non-mayo coleslaw also works *wonderfully.*\n\nIf you use a non-mayo (or a mayo-based, though it's less healthy) coleslaw, you won't even need dressing.  If you don't, a simple vinaigrette works beautifully.  Kraft makes a lime vinaigrette that works great (60 kcal/serving), or you can make your own by combining lime juice, a neutral oil, a mild vinegar (such as white wine or rice wine), and seasonings of your choice (garlic, chili powder, cumin, etc) and whisking it until it emulsifies.\n\nAdd your veg in whatever proportions you like, drizzle a little dressing over them, and eat.  It's quick, it's easy, it doesn't require anything (not even refrigeration, though I think it tastes better when all the veg is chilled) special, and it'll keep the hunger pangs away until you can get something more substantial in your belly.  It's also fairly low calorie (most of the calories will come from the tortillas, so you can omit those and just eat it as a diced fresh \"salad\" if you have the utensils for it) and relatively high nutrition (mostly vitamin C and vitamin A, along with a smattering of other micronutrients.)\n\nIt's worth noting that cucumber doesn't have much nutritional value, but in this case I feel it's a positive - it takes up space (and tastes great), which helps you keep those hunger pangs away, making you less likely to end up getting a bag of Doritos or whatever instead.  I'm not sure what other veg you could substitute for the cukes.  You could try substituting actual fruit, too.

Most people normally eat a 3-oz. portion during a meal. This equals roughly 21 grams of protein. So to get the same amount of protein from a 3-oz. serving of chicken you would need:\n\n1 cup, plus 2.5 tablespoons of lentils. These little legumes pack quite a protein punch. If eating a lentil soup, stew or veggie burger, this quantity can be easily consumed.\n\nOR\n\n1-1/3 cups of black beans. Black beans might not be as powerful as those small lentils, but black beans are often times paired with rice, which helps equip you with a complete protein.\n\nOR\n\n1-1/2 cups (just a little less than this, actually) of chickpeas. Chickpeas are a versatile ingredient and become a complete protein when served as hummus with tahini (sesame paste).\n\nBut this starts the old debate of do we need to be eating as much protein as we currently do?

Recovery from endurance exercise has quite different requirements from resistance training. The common recommended amount of protein for building muscle (i.e., being in a positive nitrogen state in the presence of a stimulus induced by resistance training) is 1.3-1.8g per KG of body mass (for individuals with reasonable levels of body fat). The RDA of protein for the average sedentary person is vastly understated for optimal muscle growth.\n\nGetting enough protein as a vegetarian or a vegan is possible, but it is a lot easier to end up in too much of a caloric surplus and simply get fat.", "id": "d9f3pd4"}, {"comment": "I strength train as well.

The first post I saw was by /u/pabstyloudmouth and since I've tried and tested various recipes to come to this.  \n  \n**Recipe:**   \n\n**Batter**   \n- 1 Head of Cauliflower (5 cups)  \n- 1/2 Cup of Flour  \n- 1/2 Cup of Cornstarch  \n- 1 tsp onion powder  \n- 1 tsp garlic powder  \n- 1 tsp of paprika  \n- 1 tsp salt  \n- 1 tbsp of Olive Oil  \n- 1 Cup of almond milk (or Cow\u2019s milk/Soy)  \n   \n**Buffalo Hot Sauce**   \n- 1 tbsp butter  \n- \u2153 Cup Frank's Hot Sauce  \n- 1 tsp of Honey \n \n**Honey Garlic**  \n- \u2153 Cup of Honey  \n- 1 Tablespoon Soy Sauce  \n- 2 Garlic Cloves (Minced)  \n  \n**Thai**    \n- 1 tbsp of Sesame Oil  \n- 1 tbsp of Sweet Soy Sauce  \n- 1 tbsp of Rice Vinegar  \n- 1/2 tsp Fish Sauce  \n  \n**Dip**    \n- 1 Cup Greek Yoghurt  \n- 1/2 Tablespoon Lemon Juice  \n- \u00bd Teaspoon Dijon Mustard  \n- \u00bd Teaspoon Onion Powder  \n- \u00bd Teaspoon Garlic Powder  \n- Salt to Taste  \n \n**Instructions**    \n1. Preheat oven at 450 Degrees Fahrenheit. Wash and cut florets into bite size pieces.  \n2. Prepare batter by adding all ingredients into a mixing bowl, and whisk till there are no clumps. Add cauliflower florets to batter and mix till all cauliflower is coated.  \n3. On a parchment lined baking sheet, place coated florets, shaking off excess batter, and being careful not to overlap each other. Place baking sheets in the oven for 20 minutes. If extra crispyness is desired. Flip halfway.  \n4. Prep each sauce in a pot or pan on medium heat till they reach a boil. Each sauce should only take 1-2 minutes to boil. If only making 1 sauce, multiply the sauce ingredients quantity by 3.  \n5. Toss florets in sauce, and bake for another 15 minutes.  \n6. Prep dip by mixing all ingredients together. Serve wings and dip with carrots and celery.  \n  \nWhat flavors would you make this with?  ", "id": "czutzvl"}, {"comment": "Well thanks for remembering me!

See my comment above if you care about more explanation of that.  No worry.  \n\nHowever, using the example that some societal focus and resources must be taken from one area in order to place more where I'm suggesting, yes.  I absolutely agree with you.  Yes it will inconvenience people, yes it will disrupt and change many areas of cash flow.  This will have consequences and require a lot of work and change of infrastructure to support it.  It will acquire readjustment periods and retraining and replanning for many.  But there are also many already trained, who could begin to bring their contributions forth as it is being discussed and formed. Many are trained closely and would only need minor retraining.  It would take many heads, but it could come together.  It certainly seems worth it considering the mental and physical issues that plague us as a whole human race.   I am not suggesting that I, personally will have complete answers to all of this in my lifetime.  But I stand by my opinion this it is a more beneficial focus of attention than allowing ourselves to be at the mercy of others for our individual wellbeing.  \n\nI still am not convinced that currency is finite.  We have been gaming the system.  We have an unpayable debt, and thus are at their mercy and must continue borrowing and never repaying.  Yet they keep borrowing.  I'm certainly not stating that it can't come down on our country, in some ways it already is.  But that doesn't mean we can't spend our borrowed and theoretical money differently.

So my comment is a bit rash, isn't it?    I know it must be in many ways different from what I learned.  Though I'm sure they could manage to spend some time in health class covering basic herbal treatments that can easily be verified and referenced.  Perhaps just bring in someone trained to do a presentation once a year, or anything to get that seed planted. But who knows, maybe there are similar things happening somewhere and I don't know about it.  I haven't been in school for quite a while.  Either way, my intent was that focus should be placed on such topics, and that they should have higher priority, as the information isn't hard to source.  If we are concerned about nutrition in schools, thrn we should be concerned about simple home health care.  It would take some shift in resources, yes.  But is it doable?  I believe it is.  Now do I have the ability to make this happen?  absolutely not.  \n\nYou are completely correct that any \"good idea\" must have appropriate time, resource, planning, and means or it doesn't amount to much.  I agree that some things may suffer, but I have faith in us as humans to try and see that there are resources being placed in areas that could stand to take a little less priority over our physical and mental health as a whole.  And with that more secure, won't we be better equipped to come to rational solutions to other issues?\n\n\nThe original comment that I made simply shouldn't have been placed in this thread.

I particularly enjoy grapes, pineapple, and clementines.\n\n- Loose veggies, like carrots, celery, and cherry tomatoes.\n\n- Deli soup! My grocery store makes fresh soup all the time, a lot of nicer stores will have a pretty great deli soup selection. You can also make soups/stews at home (shoutout /r/slowcooking) and reheat them.\n\n- Baked Potato! Bring a potato, invest in some real cutlery so you can poke holes in it with your fork.

Seriously, cooking dinner every night is also a great way to make lunches for the next day(s). Cooking in bulk saves time and energy, and it can save you money, too.\n\nHelpful purchases:\n\n- Get a spiralizer! Lets you turn veggies into pasta for all other things you'd use pasta for, like pasta salad. In fact, pasta salad is also a great side, too.\n\n- Thermos! Others have already mentioned it, but thermoses work like a charm and there's nothing better than hot soup on a cold day.\n\n- Little containers for \"sides\" or fixings, like bacon or cheese.\n\n- Slow cooker!\n\n- Real cutlery and a plate/bowl!

Not a huge savings over the grocery store since they're just so much demand for them.  Again, however, the freezer is your friend.

The larger bulk deals are okay but you can sometimes beat them at discount grocery stores like WinCo.\n\nBut the meat is next to no grocery store. You have to go to a local butcher to get the [quality cuts they have at Costco](https://imgur.com/a/YcJeE).\n\nYou can also get primals and cut your own for *much* cheaper than buying pre-cut. Every once in a while I buy a big primal rib. I cut a roast, a few steaks, and grind some for some ultra-premium hamburgers. Costs about $120.\n\nIf bacon is your thing you can also buy whole pork belly. Cut it into thirds, throw each in a gallon ziplock with some brine for a week, smoke (or cook very gently if you can't smoke) for a few hours and you've got home made bacon for $1.50/lb minus the cost of curing salt and sugar.\n\nI don't know if this is a company-wide thing but mine has seafood events where they have monster lobster tails and prawns.\n\nThe whole chicken and chicken pieces at Costco are the only meat that I don't find at all competetive.

Although it is reported that excessive iodine does not cause thyroid antibody positivity, high intake can cause or worsen symptoms for people with previous thyroid autoimmunity or other underlying thyroid issues [47]. **Transient hypothyroidism and iodine-induced goiter is common in Japan and can be reversed in most cases by restricting seaweed intake** [16,29,48-52]. In Asian cultures, seaweed is commonly cooked with foods containing goitrogens such as broccoli, cabbage, bok choi and soy [18]. The phytochemicals in these foods can competitively inhibit iodine uptake by the thyroid gland (i.e., isothiocyanates from cruciferous vegetables) [53-55], or inhibit incorporation of iodine into thyroid hormone (i.e., soy isoflavones) [56,57].\n\nCertain species of seaweed can concentrate bromine, a halide similar to iodine with no known physiological function, at very high levels [58,59]. If seaweeds with elevated levels of bromine and low levels of iodine are consumed when the body is in an iodine deficient state, inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis--due to bromine's attachment to tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin in place of iodine--is plausible [60].", "id": "d8ny8sq"}, {"comment": "I've actually thought about this!

Yes, razor blades are a great deal but I don't need a 7-year supply (female buying men's blades). I will apologize in advance for the lack of formatting; I'm on mobile. \n\n-Kirkland brand multivitamin, women's formula \n-toothbrushes\n-protein powder\n-most toiletries if they have your brand and you have storage space\n-melatonin, Unisom\n-condoms \n-raw mixed nuts (always very fresh, too, and no crumbs!) \n-protein bars (the brand I buy has 30g of protein each) \n-any and all fresh produce. Very economical but also somehow lasts way longer than anything bought elsewhere. I usually buy one fruit, 2 bagged salads, and 2-3 vegetables per trip and I go once per month. I'll need to freeze part of the veg because I can't eat it all quickly enough. \n-plain Greek yogurt. Comes in a 3 pack but freezes well\n-frozen fruit (dark organic cherries and Dole mix are what I usually buy) \n-any and all meat, fish, seafood. I often get yellowfin tuna steaks, chicken thighs, unsliced bacon, raw shrimp, tilapia, cod, and sliced rosemary ham (I get the ham with Costco's creamy havarti cheese slices... add honey mustard = the most amazing grilled cheese sandwich). \n-bread\n\n\nHonorable mentions (in CAD):\n-I got a set of aluminum snowshoes w/poles for $80 last month. Amazing deal. \n-New winter boots this year for $45 and I'm very happy with them. The aesthetics could be better but are above average. Soles are grippy, they're easy to put on, very warm, and the lower part is water resistant. \n-I don't wear glasses or use hearing aids but both are a great deal at Costco (source: parents, grandparents, etc.).\n-When I was on the market for a chest freezer, Costco was cheapest by far.

However, they only come in bulk and if you're single, it's only feasible if you cook all the vegetables at once and freeze them all.  I usually put them through a food processor to reduce the voids and make them easier to portion out among separate Tupperware containers.  You'd be surprised how much cooking and grinding increases the space efficiency of vegetables.\n\n* **Fruits** are also cheaper per unit, but because most are best eaten fresh, a bulk purchase is feasible only of those that don't spoil easily, like apples.\n\n* **Avocados** are slightly cheaper per unit.  Not a huge savings over the grocery store since they're just so much demand for them.  Again, however, the freezer is your friend.  Use that processor to turn the entire bulk package of avocados into guacamole.  You can even mix it with your processed vegetables to reduce the amount of containers you use.\n\n* **Eggs** are almost a steal.  In CA, they're about $6-7 for 5 dozen.  Yup.  Use your *oven* to bake a dozen at a time (325 deg F for 25 minutes), and you have hard \"boiled\" eggs for a week.\n\n* **Car tires** are a good deal.  Every month, Costco offers a $75 discount or so (off a set of 4) on a different brand, and since there are only so many tire brands, the cycle repeats itself throughout the year.  They install them for you too.  \n\n* **Gasoline**.  Top Tier gasoline, but almost always the cheapest in the area, beating even Arco, and you can pay with your Visa.  Speaking of which ...\n\n* **Citi Costco Visa Card**.  4% back on gasoline purchases at any gas station including Costco.  Just the cash back on gas purchases for the year more exceeds the Costco membership fee.

Peel and slice the ginger, crush the garlic (I diced it up really fine), slice the mushrooms into thin strips, remove the skin from the chicken.\n2. Place the rice in the bottom of the slow cooker, then the garlic, ginger, and mushrooms on top. Put the chicken in last. Add the water on top (I used 8-9 cups).\n3. Turn on slow cooker on high for 4 hours. After the four hours is up, give it a good stir.\n4. After cooking, take the chicken out, remove the meat from the bone, and then shred the meat. Give the pot one more good stir, and return the shredded meat to the slow cooker.\n5. Taste the Jook/Congee, and add salt as desired to bring out flavours, remember you are also adding soy sauce later on.\n7. Ladle the Jook/Congee into bowls, and drizzle approximately 1tsp of the oil and soy sauce on each bowl, and then sprinkle the toppings on top.\n8. Serve.\n\n#Notes\n\nYou could also do this on the stove top - use 10 cups of water. Add ingredients as above, and cook over high heat until boiling. Once boiling reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1-2 hours or until a thick porridge forms. Stir often to prevent burnage/sticking. Once it is thickened up, continue from step 4 above.\n\n[Receipe adapted from Budget Bytes](http://www.budgetbytes.com/2016/03/instant-pot-congee-jook/)\n\nEdit: when I first opened up the slow cooker at the 4ish hour mark, it didn't seem too porridge like.
