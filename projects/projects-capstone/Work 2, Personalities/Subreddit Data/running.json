I was JUST back to running after recovering from a stress fracture in September, and I decided to go for a short ~1.5 mile run on Christmas Day during the kids' nap time. I went shirtless.\n\nAround 1.3 miles in I'm on the sidewalk of a residential street (a man part of my normal path) when suddenly I see a car, traveling the same direction that I am, veer from its lane and sideswipe a mailbox. He was traveling west, veered into the eastbound lane, through the bike lane, off the road into a mailbox before correcting his course.\n\nShocked, I yelled at him as he drove off. Note, I was BARELY back from injury, so sprinting just wasn't gonna happen. As he drove off I could see the damage to his car, and it was, albeit cosmetic, pretty extensive. I would guess he did ~$1,000 in damage or more from the dents and scratches. \n\nWe were fairly close to a main road, maybe 0.1 miles, and he stopped in his lane about 50' from the road. I ended up catching up to him because he was just sitting there. I look in his window and see that he's texting. I yelled at him that he hit a mailbox. He gets out of his car and says \"oh, did I?\" I kid you not. At this point I realize that he looks a little drunk, bloodshot eyes, seemed to slur his speech a little.\n\nSomewhere in here he gets angry at me. He starts saying \"what you gonna do about it superman? I'll f*ck you up right here!\" Soooooo now sprinting is solidly back on the table as my 5'10\" ~160lb frame isn't about to tangle with 6'2\" ~250lbs of crazy/possibly drunk.\n\nA few other people stopped, as by this point captain psycho-pants was blocking traffic, and beeped/yelled. Finally he agrees to go back and look at it. He yells at me to show him which one it was that he hit. As I turned to do so, he promptly sped off. Honestly it's probably for the best that he did as I'm not properly equipped to deal with an angry, aggressive, possibly drunk crazy person on Christmas Day. Toddler with a temper tantrum? That's a little more my speed. At any rate, I had already read his tag a few times, but in the excitement I'm not sure if I got it right or not.\n\nI was really close to home so I quickly ran home, regaled my epic saga for my wife, who was rather annoyed to be awoken from her Christmas Day nap by her stinky, sweaty, adrenaline filled husband, while I scribbled a note to tape to the door of the house that owned the offending (offended?) mailbox as they weren't home when I knocked.\n\nAs I ran back to the scene of the incident I saw a cop driving by. I flagged him down. His first words to me were \"am I looking for you?\" It turns out that someone thought big crazy dude had teamed up with a few other cars, who were actually just trying to get around him, and that they were gonna end me. I gave him everything I knew and went home to shower. \n\nThe mailbox (one of those plastic ones like [this](http://images.lowes.com/product/converted/733538/733538545209lg.jpg)) is still there, albeit a little off center now and pretty dinged up. I have no idea if they caught the guy or what, or if they just made sure the mailbox would still work and left it. \n\nThe thing that really scared me? When I run with the girls in the stroller, I tend to run in the bike lane because there isn't much traffic on that road as it's literally a residential subdivision, and it's just easier to push a stroller in the bike lane than on a narrow sidewalk. Had I been in the bike lane then, he would've hit me. No doubt about it.\n\nBut yeah...shirtless running gone wrong again...", "id": "d09ls0c"}, {"comment": "It's the nipples, man.

I started running back in September and set a goal of running a 5K regularly. I was able to hit that in a few weeks and started trying to beat my personal best every time I ran (just running solo and for exercise). I was actually doing very well as far as getting my time down. One day I decided to add some distance but could barely get to a 6K. I posted here on /r/running and found out you're not supposed to run your fastest every time (not saying thats what you're doing but its what I was doing). \n\nTwo days later when I went out for a run, I paced myself using my Garmin, and I ran a 10K just like that! It was a pretty big wake up call for me. I still mostly run 5K's since it fits nicely into my morning routine but when I do go for longer distances I know I can do it if I pace myself. "], [1, "Running is a bitch of a sport. It seems so simple....you just run. You walk all the time, how hard can it be? \n\nThe thing is, running is really tough.  You are basically balancing on one foot, then hopping to the other, over and over again.   That takes strength and coordination.   If any muscle from your foot to your core is either too weak or doesn't know when to fire, your form goes to shit, stuff gets overloaded and you have a bad time.   You come from a gym background....think of running like squats or deadlifts.  You don't just pick up a bar with 500 lbs.  You have to train your muscles the proper form and make sure all the supporting muscles can handle it.   \n\nOn top of that, you are taxing your cardio system. So it's a double whammy.  It also takes time to build enough cardio to run nonstop for 20+ minutes.  So you spend a good month either dieing because you refuse to walk or feeling like a goober because you are walking while everyone else cruises past you. \n\nDo what others have suggested. Find a couch to 5k program.   Intervals are the way to go.  They build both strength and cardio.   Your mantra should be \"don't out run my form \".  You should feel rock solid when you run with your core supporting good posture and your hips and glutes engaged.  If you start to plod along, it's time to stop. Don't be a hero.   You may just need to walk a minute to rest, but do not try to press on with bad form. \n\nAlso, in addition,  do \"dry land\" exercises to help with your core stability and form.   You don't want to out run your form, so you need to actively improve it.   This is a lesson I had to learn the hard way, which resulted in a 5 year hiatus with knee problems.  It helps keep you injury free and in the end makes you a better and faster runner. \n\n  Plyo is awesome. It teaches the neuromuscular coordination you need to properly balance while running.   Balance exercises are good too. One leg squats (unweighted) and step ups onto a high box are my gotos.  If these suck when you try them, just remember you are basically doing an easier form of that exercise with every stride.  If you make them not suck, running will be easier.  If you look up cross country skiing dry land exercises, you will find a ton of other great hip and core stability exercises that will make a night and day difference. "], [-1, "What the actual fuck?

I actually associate long runs with World War I now, because he has a 6-part series on that and each part is 3+ hours long. Covered a lot of ground while learning a lot. New episodes are VERY rare (like 1, maybe 2 per year) but there's a good back catalogue to go through. \n\n* Common Sense - The same guy who makes the hardcore history podcast also makes this current events podcast. Long episodes, although updates are rare (maybe 1-2 a month). But he's got an interesting way of thinking about things, even if I don't agree with everything he says. \n\n* Criminal - Good shorter podcast that tells crime and punishment stories. \n\n* Death, Sex, and Money - Some great stories in this. I don't love the ones with celebrities as much, but the regular story episodes tend to be great. \n\n* Detective - Pretty interesting first \"season\" that's all just interviews with this retired homicide detective from Colorado. If that sort of thing interests you, it's a good time-filler (episodes are short) and he has a great voice for radio. \n\n* Freakonomics radio - If you're familiar with the book/movie you basically know what this is. Behavioral economics/economic theory applied to everyday stuff. Some episodes are very interesting. \n\n* The Mortified Podcast - adults reading embarrassing entries from their teenage diaries. Sometimes pretty funny, and makes a nice light change of pace from all the more serious stuff on here. \n\n* Song Exploder - short podcast where an artist breaks down their song piece by piece, then you hear the whole song together at the end. Pretty cool even though since I'm out of touch I've never heard of any of the artists or songs before.\n\n* 99% Invisible - Cool podcast about vaguely design related stuff. I'm not that into design but it's very well done. \n\n* StarTalk - Neil Degrasse Tyson + comedians. It's kind of annoyingly produced and they never get into as much depth as I wish they would, but the comedians are often funny and space is interesting, so it can be a good one to go to sometimes. \n\n* Surprisingly Awesome - you've probably heard them mention this on Reply All, since it's another Gimlet Media show. It's straight-up not as good as Reply All, but some of the episodes *are* interesting nevertheless.\n\nI'm also interested in climate change, so I listen to Climate One and Forecast: Climate Conversations but both would be pretty dry if you're not interested in the topic. And behavioral psych so I also listen to Hidden Brain and You Are Not So Smart sometimes. \n\nHonorable mention to The Bugle. Hands-down the funniest podcast ever. Sadly, it hasn't updated with a REAL episode in like a year.

", "id": "d0lvze1"}], [{"comment": "Running is a bitch of a sport. It seems so simple....you just run. You walk all the time, how hard can it be? \n\nThe thing is, running is really tough.  You are basically balancing on one foot, then hopping to the other, over and over again.   That takes strength and coordination.   If any muscle from your foot to your core is either too weak or doesn't know when to fire, your form goes to shit, stuff gets overloaded and you have a bad time.   You come from a gym background....think of running like squats or deadlifts.  You don't just pick up a bar with 500 lbs.  You have to train your muscles the proper form and make sure all the supporting muscles can handle it.   \n\nOn top of that, you are taxing your cardio system. So it's a double whammy.  It also takes time to build enough cardio to run nonstop for 20+ minutes.  So you spend a good month either dieing because you refuse to walk or feeling like a goober because you are walking while everyone else cruises past you. \n\nDo what others have suggested. Find a couch to 5k program.   Intervals are the way to go.  They build both strength and cardio.   Your mantra should be \"don't out run my form \".  You should feel rock solid when you run with your core supporting good posture and your hips and glutes engaged.  If you start to plod along, it's time to stop. Don't be a hero.   You may just need to walk a minute to rest, but do not try to press on with bad form. \n\nAlso, in addition,  do \"dry land\" exercises to help with your core stability and form.   You don't want to out run your form, so you need to actively improve it.   This is a lesson I had to learn the hard way, which resulted in a 5 year hiatus with knee problems.  It helps keep you injury free and in the end makes you a better and faster runner. \n\n  Plyo is awesome. It teaches the neuromuscular coordination you need to properly balance while running.   Balance exercises are good too. One leg squats (unweighted) and step ups onto a high box are my gotos.  If these suck when you try them, just remember you are basically doing an easier form of that exercise with every stride.  If you make them not suck, running will be easier.  If you look up cross country skiing dry land exercises, you will find a ton of other great hip and core stability exercises that will make a night and day difference.

No matter what, those who race in each of these distances train A LOT.

The whole concept of the article seems false from the start, where it states \"race\" yet many people don't \"race\" at all, they participate. Hell, I no longer race, even short distances like 5k. I dont challenge the top spots anymore, and I doubt many would with the \"only need 30 miles to train!\" mentality of the post, which then goes on to point out great 5k runners and their times.\n\nI feel like the article missed the mark because it tried to make the point of being healthy with lower mileage, and running shorter races to complement the lower mileage.

In fact, he would go further because he would spend half his time exporting in the woods and then having to catch up to my Dad. That was his favorite thing to do. He ran with me and he ran with my brother. He was my Dad's dog first but he loved all of us. Ran off more times than I could count but we couldn't blame him. He loved running and he loved adventures.  He was 14 and still going on runs with my Dad. My Dad figured if he could go then it would be a shame not to let him. \n\nEventually he slowed down and couldn't do the runs but walks were fine.  I was out of college living away when my Dad called and said they finally had to put him down. He was blind, limping along and just had worn out his body. It was a sad day for our family. He lived a long time. We always said whenever anyone asked how we got Snoop that he adopted us.  He was a special dog.

Stay strong"], [2, "If I can use this time as a lurker to put out my first post of a tangential kind of thing.\n\nIn 2014 of xmas i weighed in at ~250 lbs. January of 2015 I started dieting and working at a factory. The factory work is very strenuous work so I was getting a moderate amount of exercise but nothing specific or targeted. Either way fast forward to the beginning of this year. In that time I lost ~50 pounds. So down around 200 lbs now I felt much more comfortable engaging in exercise in addition to my strenuous job.\n\nSo I started running seriously over the last month. The side bar and my local running shop have been a huge help. I am training mostly for general fitness but I plan to do a few races this year since my competitive spirit is itching.\n\nAbout 2 months ago I had an accident and fell. I hurt my neck and shoulders pretty bad. It turned into me taking about 2 weeks of running off. When I finally started to be pain free sadly I re-injured it. It was mainly due to my repetitive work conditions, but was exacerbated by upper cross syndrome, a relic of my long years of sedentary life style I'm still trying to fix. So now I'm in physical therapy where they have identified a cervical and thoracic spinal sprain. I have been completely pain free only 2 or 3 days in the last 2 months. Most days, especially after I started physical therapy, have been painful but manageable. \n\nAll that being said yesterday I ran my longest distance in training, 13.67 miles. I pushed hard and I hurt all day and still have some sores today, outside of my neck. \n\nThe point I'm trying to get at is that there are plenty of us out here who are trying to get better, but injuries keep popping up. You have to stay strong and keep pushing. The only way to get better is a balanced approach to training and resting. I think its a great idea to take this day and get all the self pity out. Let yourself feel both good and bad feelings. Just don't linger and keep pushing. \n\nCan't wait to see your post having completed a marathon!"], [2, "injury can prevent anyone can finishing a marathon, even a sub 2:20. not finishing sucks crap...and dnf can feel like a miserable failure, but its not. you learn more about yourself in failure and defeat than you do in achievement, at least what i've found in my life. crawling back from defeat and persisting is what makes a person humble and what makes the prize feel worthwhile"], [2, "I cried in my last ever race in high school cross country. Partly due to the pain of injury, but mostly due to the pain of failure. I'd trained years, was at my peak at state, on pace way better than I ever expected, felt great, and then....

I think part of the crying was the running hormones, I've heard a lot of people I know who are runners have complained about the excess of hormones while running. It sucks when your plan falls apart. \n\nBut first thing to deal with is that knee. Get your knee back into condition and train again. Or stick to shorter races, whatever you decide is best for you.

I was sucking air in but couldn't breathe out. I went off the course to a medic station and almost passed out. I had to be taken away on an ambulance. My PCP says it was exercise induced asthma.

Nothing too crazy but I knew it was a reachable goal. Everything started out roses. I after the first half I was cruising with a 1:53 and well on my way to sub 4. I could lose 30sec per mile and I would still meet my goal. My heart rate was in the 150s and my stride was perfect.\n\nThen at mile 19, 2:38 into my run I suddenly vomited. I felt fine then I had to stop but I didn't know why, then I puked like a Sorority girl on Sunday morning. I though Ok, that's over with, I still got this. And ran one more mile until it all fell apart. I puked after taking in any water the rest of the race and I was forced to walk up the hill at mile 20. I was sobbing (38 year old man), legs shaking and doing everything I could to keep moving forward. I was bring circled by medical help like a dying man is circled by buzzards. One lady ask me if I needed anything: My response \" I need to finish\". \n\nI was lucky that I was able to finally complete the marathon (depressing 4:31). I puked at the finish, I puked at the expo, I puked in my room.

In both our cases it came down to injury, and as much as we like to say that we have control over every aspect of our lives, we don't really. \n\nShit happens.\n\n The most important thing I've learned in this sport is to pick yourself up, learn what you can and move forward. If that forward is taking time off, hitting the pool and bike for a few months then that is what you do. If its changing your meals so that you are getting all the energy you need to recover, then that's what you do. If its making sure that your sleeping enough and respecting your recovery time, then that's what you do.

I will defer to your PT, but the things that helped me after an initial 7-10 day rest was:\n\n1)  Cycling.  Not only did that help me maintain aeorbic fitness, but also the cycling really helped keep my leg loose and build some strength in my quads and glutes.  Helping those has helped my overall form and balance in my legs.  BIG help.  \n\n2)  Running often, reasonably fast, but REALLY short distances.  The pain for me would set in consistently at mile 2.5 to 2.75.   So I would keep running 4-5 days a week but only 1.5 to 2 miles at a time.  Never more than 2.25   though for the first 2-3 weeks back.\n\n3)  Stretching and foam rolling.  This is huge.  I would do mine immediately after the run.

I am doing this 7 days a week. \n\n4)  When running, deliberately concentrating on my form.  When I run slow and easy, my cadence slows down and I slightly overstride and I land heavily on the outside of my foot.    I am working on a good cadence, and landing in the center of my foot (as in not too far laterally on the edge, but keeping it square and true).

I'm pretty surprised your PT's didn't diagnose this immediately, you may want to look for PT's that work with athletes and runners.  If you have running groups in your area ask for recommendations of Facebook etc.  A network of hardcore runners can point you to the best doctors, physical therapists, massage therapists etc.  Where I live we almost all go to the same group of professionals because they know how to deal with us specifically.\n\nI've had ITBS twice.  My first bout was after running two marathons in a 3 week period.  I literally could not make it a mile before I was limping home when I tried running after the 2nd marathon.  Took me 6 months to get it under control because I saw the wrong people and didnt know what I was doing.  Fast forward 6 years I currently have it again after completing a winter marathon.  However I can still run on it (40 miles a week) but its pretty uncomfortable and it gets worse on hills and longer runs.  Slowly improving by doing the right exercises. \n\nIf you have the debilitating version you may have some scar tissue that you might need worked on by massage therapist or someone using graston or ART techniques. This may not be necessary however, depends on how bad you let it get when running on it.  Get a foam roller and roll your ITBand, it will likely hurt ALOT.  You should be able to get to the point where it doesnt hurt anymore.  Roll the glutes as well, tight glutes will contribute to the problem.\n\nYou should definitely strengthen the glutes and hips.  Rest will not cure this problem.  You could take two months off and it will come right back if you don't address it.   There is a million sites that show you exercises for this.  Do the exercises religiously (I suck at this).  You need to get them strengthened and firing correctly again so that you arent compensating with the ITBand.

A good 90 minute run can leave me feeling jazzed for several days, but if I go longer--say, 120 minutes and up--the effectiveness can actually dimish somewhat.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is that if your primary goal with running is to help control depressive symptoms then there's probably an optimal amount of running for that, and your task is to discover what it is for you.

I was a varsity golfer and tennis player in high school and graduated in 2011 and didn't find running really until my first year at ASU in 2011. I've dealt with a decent amount of depression and trace amounts of anxiety since junior high. The worst part of it was probably how much it affected my sleep and I always had terrible RLS. I found running when I went to ASU basically because I was doing drugs everyday and blowing off classes but decided to sign of for the Pat Tillman run. I ran pretty well in it but didn't really keep running as a stress reliever although it helped a lot. I hit rock bottom almost a week later and had a complete breakdown. Flash forward to fall of 2013. I left ASU and was at a local community college. Turned out the XC team was 2x defending national champions. I was still struggling with college because I never really had an outlet of how I felt besides smoking a lot of pot. I joined the team on a whim and it changed my life. The teammates I had were great, and everyone on the team just pushed themselves to achieve all that they could. Thats where it became an outlet. When I would run with them they would slowly leave me behind, naturally, but in a matter of weeks I was right next to them. I just focused on all of the negative feelings I had everytime I hit the road. I have a problem with fantasizing about suicide, although I don't believe I'd ever do it. Basically anytime I started to struggle I told myself to run faster, and that if I couldn't get more out of my livelihood in that moment then what was the point in never pulling the imaginary trigger to the pistol pressed against my temple. And it really worked. I started thinking about those thoughts less in general. The problem was I got pretty good after that first season. I went from running 32 minute 8ks to running 27 min 8ks in 3 months. It became something else entirely then just a relief. I trained my ass off after that season and came back to become an All-American while running injured. I started to outrun my body because I never had the base to do what I was actually doing. I explain all of that because now I'm stuck. Running went from stress relief to causing the most stress in my life. I'm a manager in my last season of college because I'm too old and all I want to do is run absurd times (sub 25 8k) for someone that has put in less than 3000 total miles in his life. And I can't seem to shake the disappointments of finishing 9th and not 1st in cross or being 5th and 8th in the 1500 and 800 respectively. Thats something I should be proud of and I just look at as failure. I want running to make me feel less depressed again as opposed to making me feel more but I fear the passion I developed for getting better in the sport itself is never going to let me have that again.

I was a varsity golfer and tennis player in high school and graduated in 2011 and didn't find running really until my first year at ASU in 2011. I've dealt with a decent amount of depression and trace amounts of anxiety since junior high. The worst part of it was probably how much it affected my sleep and I always had terrible RLS. I found running when I went to ASU basically because I was doing drugs everyday and blowing off classes but decided to sign of for the Pat Tillman run. I ran pretty well in it but didn't really keep running as a stress reliever although it helped a lot. I hit rock bottom almost a week later and had a complete breakdown. Flash forward to fall of 2013. I left ASU and was at a local community college. Turned out the XC team was 2x defending national champions. I was still struggling with college because I never really had an outlet of how I felt besides smoking a lot of pot. I joined the team on a whim and it changed my life. The teammates I had were great, and everyone on the team just pushed themselves to achieve all that they could. Thats where it became an outlet. When I would run with them they would slowly leave me behind, naturally, but in a matter of weeks I was right next to them. I just focused on all of the negative feelings I had everytime I hit the road. I have a problem with fantasizing about suicide, although I don't believe I'd ever do it. Basically anytime I started to struggle I told myself to run faster, and that if I couldn't get more out of my livelihood in that moment then what was the point in never pulling the imaginary trigger to the pistol pressed against my temple. And it really worked. I started thinking about those thoughts less in general. The problem was I got pretty good after that first season. I went from running 32 minute 8ks to running 27 min 8ks in 3 months. It became something else entirely then just a relief. I trained my ass off after that season and came back to become an All-American while running injured. I started to outrun my body because I never had the base to do what I was actually doing. I explain all of that because now I'm stuck. Running went from stress relief to causing the most stress in my life. I'm a manager in my last season of college because I'm too old and all I want to do is run absurd times (sub 25 8k) for someone that has put in less than 3000 total miles in his life. And I can't seem to shake the disappointments of finishing 9th and not 1st in cross or being 5th and 8th in the 1500 and 800 respectively. Thats something I should be proud of and I just look at as failure. I want running to make me feel less depressed again as opposed to making me feel more but I fear the passion I developed for getting better in the sport itself is never going to let me have that again. This is kind of just a rant, but yeah, its sad. I miss running, yet I never stopped once I started, and no one around me even has a clue.

For example, if that 5k a day is the same loop, try running it backward. You'll probably find it a bit harder, because your body is somewhat conditioned to the turns and hills on your route. Changing your routes, distances and speeds keeps your muscles guessing, and they learn to be stronger as a result.\n\nAlso, what improved my 5k time by a lot (I was stuck at 25 minutes for a long while) was doing longer runs - 8 and then 10 and now 13-15km.

Obviously he is in like PERFECT physical shape, so its not fair to aspire to be like him, but the point I try to make is that he is in excellent shape, so any changes I make that would get myself closer down the line to where micheal phelps is must be a positive change. He is taller than me and far more muscular, so to be at the same body fat % as him I would need to weigh like 160lbs, so the fact that I am aiming for 175-180 is far from unreasonable.\n\nThe other thing that kills me is that Im training for a marathon atm, and its like \"mom, you agree that anyone who can run a marathon must be in good shape. I am easily in the bottom percentile of marathon runners in terms of body fat, so you cant say running a marathon is good but being at the physical level to finish one is bad.

At the same time, *if* I had drivers behind me, I sure wouldn't expect my hearing to save me.  Earbuds or not, doesn't matter.  We have to be facing traffic and even then, it only takes a foot or two of error on the part of the driver for us to hope that our cat like reflexes save us.  \n\nBut on a bike/trail path with cyclists/etc, I think it's a different story.  Everyone expects runners, walkers, and cyclists and we're all just running, walking, and cycling.  As long as people do their activity in a straight and predictable path, it's really hard for it to be an issue.  Problems come up when walkers all the sudden turn 90 degrees into paths of passing cyclists/similar.  I used to cycle a lot and this was the reason why I gave up on cycling trails.  The walkers and (some) runners where just stupid.  Without looking behind them, they would just turn and walk to the side into a (possibly) passing cyclist.  It doesn't matter if they have headphones.  It's just simple lack of common sense.  ", "id": "cy48lhg"}, {"comment": "Exactly.

I'm not saying that no one running over 5 hours has to work hard but I'm guessing the 5+ hour marathoners on average are putting in less miles than the sub 3 hour guys. There's nothing wrong with that and I really do respect the people that are out there for over 5 hours that's a long time. I know that /r/Running generally caters to slower runners but to say that they're inherently better and working harder than faster runners is ridiculous. Or maybe I'm just an elitest dick.\n\nI didn't mean to say they were better, only trying to stress that *at least* in my eyes a 5 hour marathon is just as hard as a 3 hour marathon.

I have a dog that I talk to like a baby at home, I joke with the girls I work with about how they could probably kick my ass easily if I ever got on their nervs, and I try to be super polite and upbeat as often as I can. But I know I look intimidating, and when I run I am constantly putting in a conscious effort to try and act as un-rapist-like as I possibly can, and it sometimes gets stressful. Like If I am coming up on a woman I am 99% positive she is at least considering the possibility that im some psychopath so I try to either change route, fall way back or just kick it into gear and blow past them asap. It really sucks because I would be super stoked to have a running buddy (even if just for the remainder of that day's run) and if they talked to me they would very quickly realize I am easily more scared of you than you are of me. I would really like to know what kinds of things I can do to not make people uncomfortable around me, because it really makes me feel bad and stresses me out a bit when I start feeling like I am making someone else feel uncomfortable or threatened and it sucks. Also, if I am out for a run (not at like 2am, this is more for weekend runs at noon when the park is packed and its a nice sunny day) are there any good ways to approach people who are also running? I would really like to meet some other people who are into running and run regularly because most of my friends arent, and honestly as a single guy in his early 20s I cant deny the fact that meeting and hitting it off with a girl out on a nice autumn run would literally be the greatest thing to ever happen to me. I know it is really easy to come across like a pig or a pervert so I genuinely want to know how to just be friendly and open adn completely innocent. I dont really know how you would approach that situation but honestly finding someone who is also trying to get into shape, shares a common interest and activity with me and generally enjoys being outside and getting some exercise and fresh air sounds like a fairy tail but every time I go through scenarios in my head I end up coming across like some deranged pervert/serial killer and it sucks.\n\nI get the thread is about sexual harassment so asking for this kind of advice comes across as a little inappropriate, but if we are going to come out and tell people what NOT to do, it would be nice to have an idea of what you CAN do and what is acceptable. Obviously im against rape and sexual assault, the only people on the planet who arent adamantly against those things are those that actually do it. But in all seriousness how should you approach someone if you want to strike up a casual, innocent conversation when you are out running in a popular local running route and what can people like me who look rather intimidating do to seem less threatening when we are really just teddy bears who spend their entire run stressing out over what other people are thinking about you.

Catcalling is inappropriate, but it's far from the same level as groping, or sexual assault, or rape. I'd also mention that cases of things like what happened to your mother are comparatively extremely rare- it's far more likely to be assaulted or sexually assaulted by someone the victim knows, and the percentage of stranger cases which take place outside are even more minimal.

What guys think it means is hearing a compliment about their body (which men *never* hear while women *constantly* hear, thus their valuing it) from someone that they are physically unthreatened by and possibly attracted to.\n\nI, for example, once passed a couple of drunk girls on some stairs. One blurted out \"nice butt!\" I smiled, because there was just about 0% chance that she was armed or even capable of violence, less chance that she was capable of taking me in a fight, and not unattractive. This is the dream that men have when they say \"oh I wish it happened to me.\"\n\nBut that's not what women experience.\n\nAnother time I was running through an area where homeless and drunk *men* gather. One of them shouted \"you got bigger tits than my wife!\" as I ran by. This was *not* fun, because he was profoundly unattractive, *very* close to me, and not physically insignificant. His being drunk meant that he was more likely to instigate violence. His being male meant that instead of being laughably unlikely to overpower me physically he was in the same range of strength I am. If there had been a scuffle I would in all likelihood have won, if he wasn't armed. But in that area there have occasionally been assaults that started with a bottle to the back of the head. In other words, I was looking at a potential assault by someone that *might* be able to overpower me and felt justified in intruding on my run. It took me months before I could run that route again.\n\nBut even that is not what women experience.\n\nWomen's olympic athletes are not as strong or physically capable as top-ranked high school boys' teams. The USPA adult women's record deadlift is about 30 pounds less than the USPA men's *high school* deadlift in the 114kg weight class. The average woman is as less strong as the average man as the average man is less strong than the average gorilla or bear, give or take. A gorilla can grab an adult male human and swing him into a tree and the human male can do **nothing** to stop it. An adult human male can, on average, grab a woman and swing her into a tree and she can do **nothing** about it.\n\nWhen a woman gets catcalled on a run, it is approximately the same experience as if a man encountered a gorilla on his run, and that gorilla said \"I want to fuck you.\" The frisson of terror as you realize \"I cannot outrun or outfight this over a meaningful distance and I am unarmed.

This may be true of some types of crimes but not others.\n   \n   Rape and sexual assault: they both involve a violation of a persons boundaries (this is fairly obvious) and to some degree a desire for control. In our example of the cat caller a reasonable person in the position of the cat caller would assume that the woman did not what the attention (as inferred from generally accepted social standards), and thus the action is a violation of her autonomy. Control may be presumed from an inherent size and weight imbalance between men and women. Generally we could extrapolate to sexual assault and rape an intent to breach a persons boundaries and a lack of respect for autonomy.\n   \n   Assault and murder: assault does not involve an intent to kill (otherwise it would be attempted murder), while murder does. Assault involves an intent to harm or place in fear of harm.\n   \n   Manslaughter and assault causing serious injury: these are similar as they both involve an intent to cause serious bodily injury.\n   \n   Assault: I would see this as sitting by itself. Assault basically involves an intent to cause bodily harm or fear thereof. It could include something as 'harmless' as shining a bright lazer pointer in someones eyes, inflicting pain upon them.\n   \n   So, some crimes come from the same place while others don't.\n   \n   But that's beside the point. The point was to say that even through sexual assault and rape may differ in harm, this in and of itself, does not mean that one is more excusable than the other. Neither are excusable and we should not excuse cat calling because it is harmless.

His being drunk meant that he was more likely to instigate violence. His being male meant that instead of being laughably unlikely to overpower me physically he was in the same range of strength I am. If there had been a scuffle I would in all likelihood have won, if he wasn't armed. But in that area there have occasionally been assaults that started with a bottle to the back of the head. In other words, I was looking at a potential assault by someone that *might* be able to overpower me and felt justified in intruding on my run. It took me months before I could run that route again.\n\nBut even that is not what women experience.\n\nWomen's olympic athletes are not as strong or physically capable as top-ranked high school boys' teams. The USPA adult women's record deadlift is about 30 pounds less than the USPA men's *high school* deadlift in the 114kg weight class. The average woman is as less strong as the average man as the average man is less strong than the average gorilla or bear, give or take. A gorilla can grab an adult male human and swing him into a tree and the human male can do **nothing** to stop it. An adult human male can, on average, grab a woman and swing her into a tree and she can do **nothing** about it.\n\nWhen a woman gets catcalled on a run, it is approximately the same experience as if a man encountered a gorilla on his run, and that gorilla said \"I want to fuck you.\" The frisson of terror as you realize \"I cannot outrun or outfight this over a meaningful distance and I am unarmed. I am dependent entirely on this creature's unwillingness to assault me, and it just expressed a physical interest in me\" is what women feel every time they get catcalled.", "id": "d9ah72m"}, {"comment": "Yes.

People pick up on that sort of thing very quickly, especially in high school and especially with that kind of insecure, attention-seeking behavior (Calling you out in front of the class).

Henry (say that's the kid's name), you seem to have a lot of righteousness about this, like it's really important to you that I didn't run that fast, and I think that righteousness is making you see this as a binary choice where either I ran that exact time or I'm a lying braggart. A lot of the class seems to be accepting that frame of reference. But the older you get, you'll discover that the adult world is almost never that binary. Your life will get longer, you'll have more experiences, and things that happened to you a long time ago will get fuzzy, just like things that happened when you were six are fuzzy to you now.\n\n\"If you talked to my old coach and he said I didn't run that fast, I accept that. I guess I didn't. But that doesn't make me a liar. I wasn't proactively bragging about my fastest mile. You asked me a direct question, and guess what? I really do have that memory I told you about. I really do recall that day, and I've thought of it over the years with a great deal of fondness. So if it turns out that isn't how it happened, I'm sad to find that out. I'm not sure my old coach's memory is any better than mine, since he's even older than me, but I guess you have a lot of other circumstantial evidence, and if what you really need is for me to not have run that fast, then just go with that. I'm gonna hang onto the memory of my great day where I ran faster than I ever thought I could. We can both have what we need without anybody being a liar or a bad person, and that's how the adult world is, most of the time.

Henry (say that's the kid's name), you seem to have a lot of righteousness about this, like it's really important to you that I didn't run that fast, and I think that righteousness is making you see this as a binary choice where either I ran that exact time or I'm a lying braggart. A lot of the class seems to be accepting that frame of reference. But the older you get, you'll discover that the adult world is almost never that binary. Your life will get longer, you'll have more experiences, and things that happened to you a long time ago will get fuzzy, just like things that happened when you were six are fuzzy to you now.\n\n\"If you talked to my old coach and he said I didn't run that fast, I accept that. I guess I didn't. But that doesn't make me a liar. I wasn't proactively bragging about my fastest mile. You asked me a direct question, and guess what? I really do have that memory I told you about. I really do recall that day, and I've thought of it over the years with a great deal of fondness. So if it turns out that isn't how it happened, I'm sad to find that out. I'm not sure my old coach's memory is any better than mine, since he's even older than me, but I guess you have a lot of other circumstantial evidence, and if what you really need is for me to not have run that fast, then just go with that. I'm gonna hang onto the memory of my great day where I ran faster than I ever thought I could. We can both have what we need without anybody being a liar or a bad person, and that's how the adult world is, most of the time.

One of us ...\" came from. So, just for fun and in case anyone here is mildly curious, here it is:\n\nNow for the background. \n\nAs far as I know, the origin of \"ONE OF US\" is from the old movie about circus freaks called, appropriately, \"Freaks.\" \n\nHere is the relevant clip. \n\nFreaks starred actual circus freaks and people with deformities. In the movie, they are shown as decent people, while the \"normal\" people are the assholes. \n\nThe chant was, again as far as I know, introduced to the mainstream via the Ramones song \"Pinhead\" which opens with \"gabba gabba we accept you we accept you, gabba gabba we accept you one of us\" (which follows closely with the lines from the film) and ends with \"gabba gabba hey\" which ended up being a rallying cry for Ramones fans, similar to \"Hey Ho, Let's Go.\" \n\nThat's the end of my knowledge, but for fun I figured I'd look to see what other \"ONE OF US\" references are out there. Sure enough, it pops up in The Simpsons, Big Bang Theory, South Park, The Wolf of Wall Street, and many, many more. \n\nThis is the IMDB page for the movie Freaks and is the link for the \"Connections\" page -- while not specific to the \"ONE OF US\" chant, it does show just how ubiquitous references to the movie are, which is pretty amazing considering how old the movie is and how few people have probably seen it. \n\nAnd that was today's edition of, \"Way more than you really wanted to know.\"", "id": "d8xupc8"}, {"comment": "[Actual link lol](https://youtu.be/9C4uTEEOJlM)", "id": "d8y3tdv"}, {"comment": "Thank you :-)", "id": "d8y5pw8"}, {"comment": "No problem bro!", "id": "d8y5xq7"}, {"comment": "Sis, but whatever :-).", "id": "d8y8xg6"}, {"comment": "You just made me realize that movie is what FREAKSHOW is based on in American horror.

In the beginning it sucks, and then there are minor victories - like the first time I ran two miles without stopping - and then I did a couple of races... because for me, I need a race in my future to make sure that I run frequently... signing up for races is my motivation not to skip runs.  And then at some point I noticed my pace drop from 10:30/mile to 9:30/mile.  And recently I find myself running in the 8:30/mile range.  And it wasn't something that I chose, it's something that just kind of happened.  But it happened because it's the right pace... it just feels right to run at that speed.   I will say that the big speed improvements seem to happen naturally after I restart weekly running after a big race.  So after I ran the Colorado Marathon, I literally couldn't walk for a week - it was sort of a non-hip-moving-shuffle.  And then I took two more weeks off, and then I started to ramp it up again, and that's when I noticed that I was noticeably faster than I had been.  It's like Gandalf became a better wizard after he fought the Balrog.  :)\n\nAt some point of running 3-4 days a week, it became less of a chore and more of something fun.  Something to look forward to, something less painful and more exhilarating.  For me that took about 2.5 years... but I'm probably just a bit slow on the uptake and for others it would be faster.  \n\nI will say that I think Strava helps because I'll pick a segment or two and just go absolutely as hard as I can for 0.2 miles or something like that, and that time pushing myself seems to help with my overall pace... even though it sucks doing it.  But the reward of seeing myself climb the Strava rankings motivates me to try.  And I like looking at how I did on a given run versus how I did a year ago.\n\nFor air... yeah, that sort of happens too.  But every once in a while - like yesterday :) - I find myself wondering if there's enough oxygen in the air because it didn't seem like it.

That first \"run\" was both the best and worst run of my life, because every run since has been either longer or faster, but that was the one that got me on track. Its been less than a year since I topped out at 300lbs (im 6'2 as well) and now im at 185 prepping for my first marathon. My long runs are at about the 9:45/mile pace, so you are making great progress! (especially considering you are still at 250lbs, thats where i STARTED, my first sub 30 5k and sub 60 10k didnt come until a number of months and dozens on lbs later, give it some time and you will be kicking my ass too!)", "id": "d8xn5jc"}, {"comment": "Thanks a lot man!

I started running in march (well I started the couch 2 5k program but im not sure you could call those first few \"runs\"). I ran my first 5k in april(43:30), ran my first sub30 5k in May, and ran my first race+sub25 5k in july. My first 10k (58:30) was in august, and then started building mileage for a marathon. I ran my first half marathon(1:58:30) in september and that was probably my proudest moment. It was the first time I really felt like I ran a respectable distance in a respectable time. My next run will be (hopefully) the first time I break 30k which will be great since there is a very famous 30k race in my area that im excited to participate in next year, and hopefully build up to a marathon on my birthday in december, which will mark 11 months, 100lbs, hundreds of miles all building up to the coveted marathon. If you met me a year ago you wouldnt bet i had a chance in hell, so keep at it. The nice thing about us heavier guys is that you might start off slow, but losing weight will drastically increase your performance on top of the actual training you do, and unless you have actually injured your knees/hips/ankles then you already have a strong lower body that has been trained secretly over the years of having all that extra weight on them, after running for a few months and losing 20-30 lbs you will seriously feel like you you weigh a million pounds lighter and that at any moment you have the energy to just go out and run. \n\nThough if and when I finish my marathon THAT will be my greatest running moment. Im also meeting a friend who I havent seen in years at the marathon and he doesnt know that im going to run and he still thinks im like 300lbs so im super excited to surprise him. The thought of crossing the finish line, getting that medal and shirt, and showing everyone that I can overcome whatever If i set my mind to it has been burning in my mind for months now, I couldnt be more excited and its still 2 months away.

Unless you actually have an injury, you just have to continue progressing at a steady pace and push through until your body adapts. Depending on the distance, diet really doesnt matter. I make sure to have a hearty diner the night before a big run so in the morning im not hungry so I dont have to eat (my body really doesnt handle digesting new food while running very well). On my 25k(16mile)+ long runs I bring a power bar and an energy gel, but at the half marathon distance and below I dont find i really need to bring any nutrition with me on the run, but your mileage may vary and you should really listen to your body and figure out what you need personally more than any advice I can give you. But yeah long runs I dont eat (or eat a light snack) before the run, bring some nutrition with me on the run and after the fact I just stuff my face with whatever we are having for diner. On shorter runs you really shouldnt need to worry about nutrition as most* people can store enough energy in their body to knock off 20k(give or take) and below without having to prep carbs before/during. \n\nBut yeah make sure you dont push yourself to injury, but pain is part of the process especially if you are increasing mileage.

Trust me, I don't want to get hit by a car, but there are easier things you can do.

I also run similar amounts of mileage and can tick off a sub-5 min mile and have been for many years.  Now, on to your interesting stance.\n\n\nIf you run anywhere that there's other pedestrians, cars, bikes, etc -- you SHOULD invest in a light of some type for night time running.  There's ultra light ones you'd hardly notice.  Put it on your head, and you shouldn't notice it unless you're buying really junky gear.  Charging shouldn't matter, I put it on a charger right next to my Garmin.\n\n\nI wear a headlamp whenever it's dark with a reflective belt -- a Petzl NAO to be exact.  It doesn't bounce at all combined with the top strap.  The reflective X vest I wear moves more than my headlamp, especially if I have a buff or hat on under my lamp.  \n\n\nI'm all for the approach of \"you are your own worst enemy\" -- but honestly there are enough drivers that I see get sketched out and swerve around squirrels and tiny debris here. I can only imagine the response a runner with just a vest might get when a car gets within 200ft and there's other oncoming traffic with little shoulder.  \n\n\nAlso it's just stupid dangerous to run on roads where there is debris without a headlamp.  Just last week I was jumping over glass shards and a tire iron on the side of a road where there's almost no lighting. \n\nBasically, help yourself and help others out.  If putting on a headlamp is a struggle, then I don't know what to tell you.  I can definitely tell people will notice the headlamp far before the vest.  I won't downvote your stance, but I do think it's silly.

I also don't typically run with music but with all the EVs driving around now, it's very possible to not see (from behind) or hear a car until it's on top of you.  \n\nEach situation is different, but if you're running in a fairly high traffic neighborhood at night then I think you really do need something. Reflective items are 90% there in my opinion but rely on the angle and hoping they have their headlights on. A simple light ([I use this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016HFHCTS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00)) can be unobtrusive while greatly increasing safety.  \n\nIf anything I would think someone with a high weekly mileage would be MORE interested in personal safety.

It's way better than non-reflective, but if a driver is turning a corner, the lights are not going to reflect off of you until you a couple inches from the hood of the car. \n\nIn these types of situations, more lighting on the front and back would be optimal. I've seen a couple runners in my area that wear vests that are outlined with lights and have a big square of LEDs on the front and back of the persons chest. These are optimal and make someone highly visible. \n\nIf you can upgrade to something like this, I highly recommend. If not full blown like that, I would at a minimum rig something up so that you have three lights on the front and three lights on the back. Spread them out so that the outer ones are visible from the sides. Even put them on your shoulders so that they angle out a bit. \n\nAgain, sorry you were hit. I've thankfully never hit someone myself, but have come close, and while they were wearing a similar getup to what you were wearing, because of angles, rain, reflective lighting from other surfaces, the street, cars, street lamps, etc.. it was very difficult to see amidst the myriad of other light. \n\n"], [2, "File a claim with the driver's insurance to pay for your medical bills.

I've seen a couple runners in my area that wear vests that are outlined with lights and have a big square of LEDs on the front and back of the persons chest. These are optimal and make someone highly visible. \n\nIf you can upgrade to something like this, I highly recommend. If not full blown like that, I would at a minimum rig something up so that you have three lights on the front and three lights on the back. Spread them out so that the outer ones are visible from the sides. Even put them on your shoulders so that they angle out a bit. \n\nAgain, sorry you were hit. I've thankfully never hit someone myself, but have come close, and while they were wearing a similar getup to what you were wearing, because of angles, rain, reflective lighting from other surfaces, the street, cars, street lamps, etc.. it was very difficult to see amidst the myriad of other light. \n\n", "id": "dayrps6"}], [{"comment": "File a claim with the driver's insurance to pay for your medical bills.

Hal. \nThe impact you've had on me is quite amazing.\n\nLong story short, training for Boston Marathon early 2000. Young and uneducated, I overtrained and worn away a considerable amount of cartilage under my patella. Went to four different specialists because my knees popped constantly and I still wanted to run. Was told to stop everything, including walking up steps at work. This was to extend the life of what was left of my knees. No more running. Never would be able to play tennis again. \n\nFast forward to 2009. Using a patella strap and eventually just two bandannas, I was able to successfully thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, all 2,178.3 miles of it. After 2 weeks of rest and still being the most fit of my entire life, I went for a jog. Less than 100 meters in, sharp stabbing pain in my knees!  I could walk thousands of miles but was unable to run a few feet. \n\nShared with a fellow hiker and runner friend who found inspiration with Christopher McDougall and shared it with me. More research later, I ran across you and your information online. \n\nI decided to use your plans. Put them in my Google calendar and trained every day. When someone asked me about my running schedule, I'd always say, \"Hal says I have to run X miles,\" or something to that effect. You were my personal trainer. You held me accountable. Because of this, on September 20, 2014, I ran my first marathon ever (Beat the Blerch in Seattle Wa for the interested). It wasn't without pain but I did it. Against all odds, I ran a freaking marathon! \n\nLike every other crazy runner, I signed up for more. I trained really hard in the spring/summer of 2015 and ran three marathons in the fall, two of them only a couple weeks apart! \n\nIf it wasn't for your expertise, books, and site information, I'm not sure I would have spent an unfortunate amount of money on registration fees, flights, rental cars, running kits, shoes, running books, and copious amounts of energy packets from every vendor out there (none that work for my body :(  ). But then again, I also wouldn't have been able to end that decade of my life on one of the biggest highs possible. I wouldn't have met all the wonderful people that I now call friends. More importantly, I definitely would not have been able to fulfill my goal of being able to run a marathon. Better, I found I could run three events in less than 2 months. My knees? They're fine! I still use straps but otherwise, it's all about the shoe. \n\nNext stop, 50 miler!!  \n\n**THANK YOU HAL!!!!!**\n\n.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/8OIrkkD"], [2, "Hi and thanks for doing this.

While I\u2019m happy with the progress I\u2019ve made, I\u2019m far from as fast as I want to be.

The biggest thing is a fear of over-training and the fact that most XC runners tend to peak in their junior year. However, the circumstances of my high school career have convinced me my goal is still possible.\n\nSpecifically, I dropped those 2 minutes off what amounts to only half a season of serious track training and a month and a half of summer base training. If I\u2019m able to fully utilize this winter, all of track season, and all of the summer leading up to next year\u2019s XC season, is a sub-16 5K possible for me? If so, what do I need to do to make it happen?\n\nI know I seem kind of pessimistic but I am fully committed to attaining my goal. I just need to know that it\u2019s possible.\n\nAs a side note, my coach has given me a winter training schedule that mostly consists of weight conditioning and very low mileage (peaking at 25mpw) leading up to track. I\u2019ve always considered winter a base building season like summer \u2013 higher mileage and lower intensity.

Hal. \nThe impact you've had on me is quite amazing.\n\nLong story short, training for Boston Marathon early 2000. Young and uneducated, I overtrained and worn away a considerable amount of cartilage under my patella. Went to four different specialists because my knees popped constantly and I still wanted to run. Was told to stop everything, including walking up steps at work. This was to extend the life of what was left of my knees. No more running. Never would be able to play tennis again. \n\nFast forward to 2009. Using a patella strap and eventually just two bandannas, I was able to successfully thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, all 2,178.3 miles of it. After 2 weeks of rest and still being the most fit of my entire life, I went for a jog. Less than 100 meters in, sharp stabbing pain in my knees!  I could walk thousands of miles but was unable to run a few feet. \n\nShared with a fellow hiker and runner friend who found inspiration with Christopher McDougall and shared it with me. More research later, I ran across you and your information online. \n\nI decided to use your plans. Put them in my Google calendar and trained every day. When someone asked me about my running schedule, I'd always say, \"Hal says I have to run X miles,\" or something to that effect. You were my personal trainer. You held me accountable. Because of this, on September 20, 2014, I ran my first marathon ever (Beat the Blerch in Seattle Wa for the interested). It wasn't without pain but I did it. Against all odds, I ran a freaking marathon! \n\nLike every other crazy runner, I signed up for more. I trained really hard in the spring/summer of 2015 and ran three marathons in the fall, two of them only a couple weeks apart! \n\nIf it wasn't for your expertise, books, and site information, I'm not sure I would have spent an unfortunate amount of money on registration fees, flights, rental cars, running kits, shoes, running books, and copious amounts of energy packets from every vendor out there (none that work for my body :(  ). But then again, I also wouldn't have been able to end that decade of my life on one of the biggest highs possible. I wouldn't have met all the wonderful people that I now call friends. More importantly, I definitely would not have been able to fulfill my goal of being able to run a marathon. Better, I found I could run three events in less than 2 months. My knees? They're fine! I still use straps but otherwise, it's all about the shoe. \n\nNext stop, 50 miler!!  \n\n**THANK YOU HAL!!!!!**\n\n.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/8OIrkkD", "id": "dawyl8c"}, {"comment": "Hmmm....Hal and I want to know which one you are in that picture...", "id": "daxbe1x"}, {"comment": "Cool meeting you 'in the wild', dudusan.

To that end, I\u2019ve set myself the goal of dropping another 2 minutes next season \u2013 I want to run a sub-16 5K. \n\nMy question is this \u2013 **is it possible**?\n\nWhen discussing these kinds of times with my teammates, I\u2019m typically met with a rather discouraging (albeit healthy) skepticism. The biggest thing is a fear of over-training and the fact that most XC runners tend to peak in their junior year. However, the circumstances of my high school career have convinced me my goal is still possible.\n\nSpecifically, I dropped those 2 minutes off what amounts to only half a season of serious track training and a month and a half of summer base training. If I\u2019m able to fully utilize this winter, all of track season, and all of the summer leading up to next year\u2019s XC season, is a sub-16 5K possible for me? If so, what do I need to do to make it happen?\n\nI know I seem kind of pessimistic but I am fully committed to attaining my goal. I just need to know that it\u2019s possible.\n\nAs a side note, my coach has given me a winter training schedule that mostly consists of weight conditioning and very low mileage (peaking at 25mpw) leading up to track. I\u2019ve always considered winter a base building season like summer \u2013 higher mileage and lower intensity.

He knows you as a runner and is probably the one who can offer the best advice.

For example, your half marathon 'advanced' plan typically peaks around 55 km a week.  I understand that relative to your other plans it is the most advanced.  The perception issue is that when compared to the running community that is not an advanced level of effort or training. I like the idea of a 90-120 minute run as a long run each week but then the effort dips in the middle of the week with 3x 5 km runs.  \n\nWhy did you choose this naming pattern?  Have you heard similar criticism before like this and what has been your response?", "id": "dawuqje"}, {"comment": "I'd like to echo these questions, with a few additional comments.\n\nThe Advanced 2 full marathon plan starts at ~30mpw. I'm not a high volume runner, and that's just *so* low. It peaks at ~50mpw, which again... is fairly low. Objectively,I did just run a very solid marathon (my 2nd) at ~55mpw, based entirely on my own hodgepodge \"plan\" of a Pfitz/Daniels/Hanson/what-do-I-feel-like-doing-today fusion, but I certainly could have done better if I'd sucked it up and included more volume. I will be doing exactly that when I attempt to go sub-3 at Boston 2018. Truthfully, I would expect an \"advanced\" runner to be running 40+ mpw consistently before even considering jumping into marathon training, and I'd expect doubles, and certainly with early workouts much more substantive than 4x800. Even the final taper seems a bit too soft. I just did a last 13 mile \"long run\" 8 days before my marathon, and my subsequent taper included two non-consecutive days off, and a 5.5 mile easy run the day before the race. Two consecutive days off followed by a 2-miler the day before just sounds like a recipe for lazy, lethargic legs.\n\nI appreciate this AMA, even as a known hater of the full marathon (and truthfully, the half, too haha). But like /u/RunningFromMyProblem, I'm quite wary of what constitutes \"advanced\" in your plan. That said, I think your novice 5k plan is much better than the C25K program, which is very... coddling. I haven't used either plan, but the 5000m is by and large my strongest race, and I think your program provides a better ramp-up to the event.", "id": "dawwf7f"}, {"comment": "Although I have issues with the Advanced 2 full marathon plan; I thought his taper was perfect.

What I've found throughout the years is that no matter *what* distance I'm racing, I need a day off 2 days before the event, then the nextday I run 5-6 easy miles with some strides and dynamics (I didn't do that strides/dynamics the day before the marathon, because marathon pace is generally slow enough that you don't really need snappy legs). But for me, two days off in a week is very rare, and I believe just in the week before the marathon, I took off two days before the race, and I took off the Monday before the race. I did something similar before a mid-training half marathon, and in the past I've done so for the 10 mile. I never take 2 days off for anything shorter, though, because I need the running and workouts to keep my legs fast.", "id": "dawyslc"}, {"comment": "Quality comes before quantity when you are an advanced runner. The focus for advanced runners should be to do those distances at a fast pace and a hard effort, then if you need to fill in by adding more miles you can do so.

For example, in Week 10 of the Advanced 2 Marathon Plan, you've got 6xhill (let's assume it's an 800m hill, therefore 3 quality miles there), a 45min tempo (let's call that 7 miles), a 9 mile MP workout, and a 19 mile long run. That's 38 \"hard\" miles in the week (the long run isn't done hard, obviously, but it is still a specific workout), with just 7 miles of easy/recovery/base/what have you. But let's make that 12 miles to account for warmup/cooldown.\n\nThe body will take a pretty huge beating after a 19 mile long run (followed by subsequent slower recovery) if it's not used to a 10+ miler on a random Wednesday night. I agree that advanced runners should be able to tweak advanced plans based on their training nuances, but I feel that these particular advanced plans don't have quite the basic structure that can be *molded*, yet maintained in general integrity. If an advanced runner has to nix regular MP runs (a few MP runs are fine, but every other week is a bit overkill), double/triple the length of some workouts, adjust the taper, completely change the mid-week run length ratio, and add in doubles on days with just a 3 miler... are they really using that plan anymore?\n\nI suppose a lot of this still depends on the intended definition of \"advanced\". Are the plans intended to be directed towards someone who has just run a lot of marathons and wants to PR, or are the advanced plans directed towards someone who plans to take the \"run 20 hard miles, then fully race the 10k\" approach?

Your aerobic (fat burning) zone is far more likely to be in a powerwalking pace than a jog, so spend 90% in that zone. \n\nNow would also be a good time to increase your calcium intake to mitigate any possible injuries. Try sesame seeds, spinach, kale, quinoa, broccoli, always cooking your greens. Have them every day, some at every meal if possible. These foods are also high in fibre which will help with the weight loss. \n\nBest of luck. "], [8, "Everyone has to start somewhere !

I now weigh 175 and feel so much better.  The process is not over and is a lifetime effort.  I've learned patience and to not give up.  I also learned that diet is more important than exercise when it comes to weight loss.  For me Running/Walking fit into the equation in an unexpected way.  It obviously burns calories.  For me, more importantly exercise has an anti anxiety effect which curbs my bad habit of eating to soothe anxious feelings.   I'm not perfect but I improve a bit every month.    If you string together weeks then months you will get momentum.    Also quick hits that worked for me - Drink water instead of any drinks with sugar.  Reduce carbs.  Identify your foods you use - mine was ice cream.  Ween yourself off whatever it is. Over time you won't miss it.    Don't ever give up and have compassion for yourself every day.

Lots of support there, and lots of people you can relate to and they to you.\n\nRunning is a high impact sport on your ankles, knees, and hips. Learning to stop running before it is too late is difficult, but a skill you should master. Injuries always take frustatingly long to heal and can be very demotivating. Stay healthy!\n\nConsider cross-training: other sports that are more low impact that running: biking, swimming, elliptical, walking, upper body strength training. Cross-train to keep fit when your legs need the rest.\n\nStart out easy and build up slowly over a period of weeks and months. The /r/C25K helps with this, but there are many multi-week training programs out there that can help. In any training program expect set-backs and be prepared to repeat a day (sometimes multiple times) before progressing.\n\nGood luck again!", "id": "czqkz31"}], [{"comment": "I was just thinking of you the other day - I'm so, so happy to see this update!

It's actually unavoidable, but less injury than if you did nothing at all.

Don't be afraid of those kinds of injuries though. Skinny people get them too, and you just cross that bridge when you get it. It takes years to build up the bone strength and proper form, but you won't get there without having a few weeks where you get niggles and other weird things going on. \n\nJust take it easy. Your aerobic (fat burning) zone is far more likely to be in a powerwalking pace than a jog, so spend 90% in that zone. \n\nNow would also be a good time to increase your calcium intake to mitigate any possible injuries. Try sesame seeds, spinach, kale, quinoa, broccoli, always cooking your greens. Have them every day, some at every meal if possible.

Yes, if an ankle has been bugging you, it's wiser to hold off on any race or event.\n\nHonestly, 5k/55min run seems long.  Don't let me discourage you, but even like 15 minutes per day can do a lot..    \n\nPS.  When I had various pains in my knees and started stretching before running, they actually completely went away.  So, obviously you may not expect the same awesume result of stretching, but make sure to do ankle rotations and maybe various leg stretches.  Put your toe on the ground and rotate!  Do this several seconds on each ankle as a warm up and cool down.  I had knee pain enough to make me doubt running regularaly, but the ol' reaching for the toes made it go away.", "id": "czqwthm"}], [{"comment": "Yo, mega fucking props to you!\n\nThe sleep part is GREAT isn't it?

And if anyone else is reading this, feel free to tell me how you manage to keep going once breathing becomes really labored and HR is super-elevated. \n\nOk two things. Any tips for getting over junk food addiction. I started eating clean again (for the 20th time) only a couple days ago. Right now I golden, but I know sometime soonish a craving will hit, and nothing I have will sound good and I'll want is something terrible and for the last couple years I caved every time.

Thanks for your time. ", "id": "d8ia3vx"}, {"comment": "For the running, I set out to do 20 minutes and I didn't care about pace. At times, my run got slow, but I never stopped to walk. Some might call what I did a jog, but I kept going. I kept the rhythm to keep my legs from getting that gummed up feeling they get after I stop running.\n\nWhen breathing gets hard or my HR gets really high (I watch it with a Fitbit Surge), I back off a bit and take it easy. My pace may slow, but not my rhythm. To me, that seems to be the key.\n\nAs for sugar addiction, it's very hard. During my Whole30, there were times in the first two and a half weeks where I was quick-tempered, I felt like I had the flu, and had cravings. I was determined to get past it and wouldn't allow myself to cheat. NEVER. I think that's the biggest key in the beginning. But then a weird thing happens. Once your body is over it, the cravings stop. you are no longer wanting to snack. Your body gets hungry, but doesn't crave things. My wife and I both went through this at the same time, and now, now fewer than six of my friends have all kicked sugar and they reported the same.\n\nThe key for me (and admittedly, it's different for everyone) was that I didn't see eating off-plan as cheating. I saw it as sabotage. Cheating is gaining an unfair advantage, while sabotage is ruining progress. I decided at the beginning that anything counter to my goal of getting healthy was sabotage, and who in their right mind would sabotage their own hard work? Mind trick, mind hack, etc; sure. But it did work for me.\n\nIt gets better. The cravings go away. But I know it's super hard in the beginning. It was harder for my wife than it was for me because she was a sweet stress eater while I tended to eat more savory stuff. The bad cravings lasted about three weeks for her.\n\nKeep going, man!

Your painful shins are called shin splints, and they are caused by trying to do too much too fast.  Most beginner runners get them because they try to jump straight into 2-3 mile runs, but their bones and muscles are not ready to take that kind of pounding. Even professional runners sometimes get shin splints during training when they increase weekly mileage too fast.\n\nThe only thing you can do is back off running to let them heal. When you start back again, very slowly ease back into it. Even if that means only running for a half a mile and walking the rest for a couple weeks. Then step it up to running 1 mile for a few weeks, and so forth. Eventually your bones and muscles will adapt to the impact they take while running.\n\nAlso, I'd like to add mixing in more time on the treadmill when you first start can be beneficial as well since treadmills have five and are a much softer running surface. When I first started running I ran exclusively on treadmills for a few months before I started transitioning into running outside. Even then, I used to get shin splints when I first started running outside so I would only do it like 1 day a week. Now I'm to the point that I run exclusively outside and log usually anywhere from 30-40 miles per week with no problems.  It's generally not shin injuries that I worry about anymore, but knee injuries.", "id": "d8iskeb"}, {"comment": "Thanks, I appreciate you taking the time to share that info.

I live not too far away from Helsinki and Otaniemi, so the weather there is very similar where I live. It's definitely possible to run outside most of the year, and lately the winters have been pretty mild so I haven't had to worry about freezing. However, this means that it's very wet in the winter because it's still raining and snowing. Also, last winter we had a brutal cold period with temperatures at about -28 for a while, and I don't think many people went running then.\n\nI'd recommend that if it gets very cold you go and buy a soft shell jacket ([something like this)](http://matinsakki.fi/1088-thickbox_default/matterhorn-mh-906-nanotex-softshell-takki.jpg) because they are light but keep you warm very well. If it gets really icy I'd maybe recommend a pair of shoes with those nubs on the soles to keep you from slipping, but they can be quite expensive. I've managed pretty well with normal shoes as long as I try to stay on roads that aren't covered in glassy ice. Water resistant shoes might actually be a better investment because lately it's been wet a lot more than it's been icy.\n\nSince you arrive in September you'll have time to adapt to the cold because it usually gets actually cold in November/December. Also, where you'll live there's sure to be quite a lot of roads and paths that are well kept in winter where you can run. Also, one thing I want to point out: many of the paths [like this](http://www.visithelsinki.fi/sites/default/files/styles/grid_8_fixed_ratio/public/488ulkoilureitti_pirkkolan-liiikuntapuisto_img_5148_konsta-linkola.jpg?itok=UmrL1ANL) that are in the summer meant for runners and walkers might be reserved for cross country skiing in the winter. Usually there's a sign that says so if that's the case. And no snow means no skiers, so then you can go running there without worries.\n\nHopefully this was helpful, and just ask if there's something you want to know. :)", "id": "d5oic1w"}, {"comment": "Wow, thank you so much!

I believe pretty strongly that we as runners should be pushing back as a group, and that trivializing the male victims of harassment and violent assaults in order to try and help the victims who are women is a counter productive approach, in line with the idiotic \"yeah, well women of color in country X have it even worse so stop complaining\" argument.

Surprisingly I got out of this phase in a decent shape. When I began I could run 10km in about 53 minutes on training runs. I did did a 7km race in 34:34 (roughly a 50min equivalent for 10km). The training was inconsistent. Started pretty slow and with little regularity: avg. 65km/month up to december, january and february I pretty much did nothing (50km in total) and from march on I started running a bit more, increasing up to 200km in june, nothing  in july (20km) because of exams. Real training really began in august-september 2013 with 270km each month.\n\nSo you don't even have to be that dedicated to run a good first marathon.

Like >1 hour early.)\n\nIf you don't show up, they put out a warrant for your arrest.\n\nNow, if you have a clean record and no previous offenses, what they usually do is let you off with what's called an ACD: Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal. What that means is that they'll table your case for 6 months (starting from the court date). If you don't have any run-ins with law enforcement in those 6 months, your case gets dismissed and is \"sealed\" in your record (NYS doesn't ever erase things from your record, they just \"seal\" them so that very very few people can ever see them.) However, if you have any other run-ins with the law during that time, you then have to go to court for that, AND your misdemeanor in Central Park. Luckily, my record was clean, and mine was eventually sealed.\n\nIf you don't have a clean record, then you might not get the ACD... and that means even more headaches. Yes, this is all ridiculous and a waste of the courts' time and taxpayers' money, but this is the way it is.\n\nIf it were just a ticket, it would just be like \"grumble grumble, this is an inconvenience\". But it's way way WAAAAAY more than just a simple inconvenience. You have all the stress about going to court, having to take half a day off work, etc., etc. I got my summons in November, I wasn't mentally free of it until August the next year.\n\nJust don't do it.

So biomechanically we *should* be running barefoot. Having an elevated heel can impede our natural mechanics. The idea is that proper running mechanics will allow your body to strengthen and adjust so that you won't get injured.\n\nThere's debate about how the heel drop affects your injury risk or if it even affects it at all. Studies on shoes and injury risk are very difficult to do because running is a pretty complex mechanism and there are so many other factors that can contribute to injury risk. But most of the large studies I've seen don't show much evidence for either type of shoe (traditional shoes with elevated heel vs zero drop) having a substantial effect on injury risk.

How did you handle the days you didn't feel like going out there to run? What we find is that people are more opt to getting out there when they know someone else is counting on them to go run with them. This has a huge motivating factor. So a bunch of us runners decided to develop a free app called Runopia to help people come together and run in their neighborhoods. It's already helping us keep more active than before because now we can't ignore the fact that our buddies are counting on us to be out there with them. It also helped us simplify the planning of the runs, which were always a hit or miss depending on people's schedules. I personally found the biggest challenge to be all the excuses that creep in throughout the work day. By the time I finish the work day, I'm too tired to run and before you know it, I skip a day, then two, then three...you know the cycle. :) So awesome to see you sticking to your goal!!

I think you can probably keep weight off, maybe even lose it (depending on your starting point), via running without much dietary control.

It was this past winter, when I focused more on lifting while eating better (but more), that I ended up shedding quite a bit of stubborn belly fat that never left when I was shooting for race weight.

Not the worst experience but I sometimes reflect back on that and wonder what a combination of a good diet + having more free time + being younger would have yielded.\n\nSomewhere in my late twenties I stopped drinking less, started racing instead of just running, and realized my runs improved the more I practiced and the better I ate.

It was this past winter, when I focused more on lifting while eating better (but more), that I ended up shedding quite a bit of stubborn belly fat that never left when I was shooting for race weight. If your goal is to lose belly fat, I'd say your focus should absolutely be nutrition first, lifting second, and some cardio for a bonus deficit.

Had to give that up about a month into running regularly as the low carb diet was making me get sick, made running hard, like a real chore and my hair was falling out!

I generally try to make healthy choices. Breakfast is generally a toasted bagel with avocado, egg and smoked salmon (sometimes bacon). Lunch is salad, dressing made from low-fat fromage frais, 100g of lean meat like chicken or ham and mixed grains (about 125g). Dinner is usually veg, more lean meat/fish and some sort of carb like wholewheat pasta, brown rice, sweet potato etc. I snack twice a day, usually a banana and some air popped crisps or popcorn. \n\nWeekends I don't watch my diet so much. For example, this weekend I had a takeaway (big chicken kebab in Pitts with salad and garlic mayo), Saturday I was really tired and weirdly craving sweet stuff (im a savoury girl usually!) so I ate two home-made rock cakes AND a chocolate bar. Dinner was oven chips, chicken breast covered in goats cheese, wrapped in prosciutto and oven baked, served in a ciabatta bun - very carby! Nice though! I'm not adverse to a greasy, pastry covered sausage roll, McDonalds etc. I just figure if I'm really craving something, just bloody eat it. Everything in moderation. \n\nHaving this attitude seems to work out well for me as I'm finally back into my pre-baby size skinny jeans (as of today!).

They never accused him of littering. Just the party that was there to greet him. They fined him. And published a scathing Facebook post. There was a group of 20-30 there to greet him. Mostly close friends and supporters. \n\nThe land in question is quite pristine, and just to hike it you do need a permit. They did have a permit for the group. I wasn't there so I can't characterize the atmosphere of the crowd, or any of the individuals in it. So I can't say for sure if they were out of hand. Scott rolls with a pretty eco friendly and progressive crowd. Being vegan, in the past making very pro environmentalist stances. So it would be out of character.

A lot more got defensive for Jurek. Words were had.

That people should hike their own hike. And that his attempt and all the PR / press around his trip took away from their experience or the experience of others. \n\n-  many feel that since he had a van following him and a support crew, unlike the previous record holder, that his attempt was lesser and should not be recognized. \n\n\nAt the end of the day, I'm a Jurek fan. I've always liked him. Met him dozens of times. Ran Leadville with him twice (more accurately was passed early on!) I think his AT attempt was certainly noteworthy.

It seems to work with distances far better on a bike unfortunately. "], [7, "I just got back from a ~9 mile pokerun and can echo some of this advice but have a slightly different perspective. First, the GPS does a horrible job of syncing to a fast running pace if you're trying to play while running. I've heard that you won't get throttled until you dip toward 4min/mi pace, but I was running 7:30 pace while playing the game and got throttled significantly. With a little practice, I was able to keep my pace while catching pokemon and looting pokestops. I was even passing people on my run! However, moving while doing these things seemed to confuse the game.\n\nAfter about 5 miles (~8km) of running while playing, my egg had only logged 1.2km. However, I had caught over a dozen pokemon during that time- it doesn't seem to count distance logged while in an instance.\n\nLater, I walked a couple miles and it seemed to keep up pretty well. Most of this was with the battery-saver mode on as well as AR turned off. There were some \"black out\" glitches during the run that I believe were due to the battery-saver mode but I didn't log enough distance with it turned off to be able to form a hypothesis (and now I'm exhausted!)\n\nUpdate: I've tried this on several more runs at a similar pace. I have had better results with distances getting logged. My current hypothesis is that distance logged while viewing a pokestop (just spin and go!) or gym and distance logged while in an instance with a pokemon does not count. Additionally, while the game is \"loading\", distance is not logged. If you can maintain a quick pace, running seems to be by far the best way to catch an extreme amount of pokemon. Over a car or bike ride, you can easily stop and restart your phone if you glitch out."], [8, "My observations - If you're in the US, run early. The severs were wide open at 6 am this morning - no glitches. Fire up some incense and you will pull a bunch of Pokemon out of the woods while moving. Also consider firing up a lucky egg. Since you are going to be finding new Pokemon and doing a bunch of other experience gaining activities, the egg will double your exp. 10k run today started at level 6 and finished at 10 and I managed to hatch 4 eggs. Use pokego as a motivator to drive to a new area to run. New geographies have new Pokemon. Final tip - don't be self conscious. If you see other folks checking their phone, take a break and strike up a conversation. I've met more poke-nerds in two days than in the past 20 years.

"], [4, "I've never played any of the pokemons, so it's not really nostalgic for me, and I don't really understand exactly what I'm doing, but holy crap, within the context of getting out and doing some running for fun, this is fantastic, I love it.

I mean combining running and gaming?  Win, Win!  ......No!\n\nWhen I go for a run, I'm in either two states of mind.  Either I'm running to improve on a specific performance metric or training goal (time/distance, splits, bpm, strikes/min, form, etc..), or I'm looking to zone out, relax, and just let go.\n\nFor **me** personally, attempting to play a video game while running the streets of Chicago would both negatively impede my training and also *seriously* harsh my mellow when I just need to unwind.  \n\nFrom the gaming side, me being a self-declared serious \"gamer\", Pokemon Go seems to fall mightily short on depth, skill, and quite frankly, fun.  I suppose this is the non-mobile gamer in me talking, but where is the sense of challenge when \"they\" just give you stuff (eggs?) for doing something (running) you'd be doing regardless?  Only now, you're doing that \"something\" (running) less effectively and less efficiently?\n\nFrom my perspective Pokemon GO is designed for someone who is neither a runner, or is only an occasional runner, *nor* is a serious gamer.  It seems to me this app is designed for the person who can't find motivation to just lace up their shoes and head out for a Sunday long-run *because they actually love running*.\n\nI'm NOT slamming you are anyone who enjoys this app.  I'm just saying it's not for me and that I don't understand why it would appeal to other runners who fall into a similar \"Recreational Runner/Big-time gamer\" as myself.\n\n"], [6, "No offense but Hoenn is the best."], [5, "How do you run w/ your phone?

First, the GPS does a horrible job of syncing to a fast running pace if you're trying to play while running.

However, I had caught over a dozen pokemon during that time- it doesn't seem to count distance logged while in an instance.\n\nLater, I walked a couple miles and it seemed to keep up pretty well. Most of this was with the battery-saver mode on as well as AR turned off. There were some \"black out\" glitches during the run that I believe were due to the battery-saver mode but I didn't log enough distance with it turned off to be able to form a hypothesis (and now I'm exhausted!)\n\nUpdate: I've tried this on several more runs at a similar pace. I have had better results with distances getting logged. My current hypothesis is that distance logged while viewing a pokestop (just spin and go!) or gym and distance logged while in an instance with a pokemon does not count.
