So you're getting the benefits of crates without the headaches (disposal of cardboard would be routine either way). You can also generally stack boxes like that higher because of the way boxes can be made to \"interlock\" (essentially you have each additional layer rotated so that the boxes on top are on multiple boxes instead of just one for added stability). Milk crates cannot interlock like this, so you wind up with 9 separate columns rather than one fully stabilized pallet.\n\n>And now I'm curious how Americans ship milk.

Neither opinion is right or wrong.\n\nAs far as Kylo Ren - I first questioned him as a villain when he took off his mask. Once you saw his face he seemed so much less menacing, but then I realized that that's the point. I love the fact that they're showing the internal conflict/jealousy/insecurity of a dark side character instead of things being black and white.

I also have anxiety issues, which no doubt lends some strength to my fear.\n    \nI think what's most interesting and amusing to me has been the negativity in many of the responses to my comment. People seem to think that because I'm afraid of death that I haven't accepted it, that it runs my life, that I simply need to understand some great cosmic cycle, and that I need to just get over it. This couldn't be farther from the truth. My fear of death is one of the greatest motivators of my life. I am not religious. I don't believe there is an afterlife. I have one shot at this as far as I know, and I would like to make the most of it with the time I have. I will not succeed in this. I will experience pain and suffering. I will spend some of my precious time on mundanities. But this will make the highs of my life so much sweeter because they will be done in the face of fear, not while ignoring it. I will rage against the dying of the light not because I hate death, and not because I welcome it, but because it is coming, and if I don't it might as well come right now and be done with it.\n  \nWhy do I fear death? Because the very processes of my body work against it. Because I do not know what it is. Because I cannot experience it by its very definition. Because by my very nature it is a slow falling knife that I will plunge into the happiness of my loved ones. Because it gets me out of bed every morning. Because it dulls my pain, and sweetens my joy.

I was not a smart child.) I saw my grandma fully nude, for the first and last time in my life. I caught a full glimpse of her before I apologised, dropped the rock and ran out.\n\nI must mention at this point, that my gramma was a rather large woman. She had amassed all the glorious body weight that accompanied a full, happy life. So later in the day, when I dared venture into her domain again, I sat next to her while she knitted and asked, with all the innocence of a young boy, \"Gogo, why did God give you two bums? And why did he put the other one in the front?\" My gramma was taken aback for a moment, then laughed from the depths of her stomach. She was wise enough to not give me \"the talk\" at that tender age, and just gave me some gospel mumbo jumbo, and warned me never to walk in rooms announced ever again.\n\nAs if little me was going to barge into bedrooms again. The last thing I wanted to see was bums, whether the front side or backside.
