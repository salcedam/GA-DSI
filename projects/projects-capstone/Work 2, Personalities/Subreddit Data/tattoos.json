Getting a Horus tattoo if you're into Egyptology just seems like a biologist getting a tattoo of their favorite plant. However, I've gotta agree with you that it would be a bit rude to just get a random Egyptian tattoo because it looks all cool and foreign and mystical. And a lot of Sam Clark's work just seems to be hot men and women surrounded by images of Eastern religion and history.

Satan has three faces and a pair of bat-like wings affixed under each chin. As Satan beats his wings, he creates a cold wind which continues to freeze the ice surrounding him, and the other sinners in the Ninth Circle. The winds he creates are felt throughout the other circles of Hell. Each of his three mouths chews on Judas, Brutus, and Cassius. Scholars consider Satan to be \u201ca once splendid being (indeed the most perfect of God\u2019s creatures) from whom all personality has now drained away.\u201d [1] Satan, also known as Lucifer, was formerly the Angel of Light and once tried to usurp the power of God.

My largest pieces are the ones I love the most. (Although, to be fair, I have never gotten a piece that I regreted.)

For one, you want them to draw it on paper or stencil it on you with their own hands before that is made permanent. Two, everyone has their own style. It will look better if it is done in the style that the artist is comfortable with, and it will look like a copy if you are having them copy something they aren't used to doing. Lastly, the artist may need to make modifications so that it will tattoo well. Some lines and some colors may not hold well or translate into being a tattoo well.

What makes good literature is the message behind it and the purpose of the book. Harry potters message is the same lame ass message of every rom com. It's the idealized love conquers all.

The Old Norse equivalent was used of male foxes, tomcats, and dragons; and the Germanic root word perhaps originally meant \"male animal in its prime.\" Meaning \"pertaining to or composed of males only\" (stag party) is American English slang from 1848. Stag film \"pornographic movie\" is attested from 1968. Stag beetle, so called for its\" horns,\" is from 1680s.\n\nbuck (n.1) \n\"male deer,\" c. 1300, earlier \"male goat;\" from Old English bucca \"male goat,\" from Proto-Germanic *bukkon (source also of Old Saxon buck, Middle Dutch boc, Dutch bok, Old High German boc, German Bock, Old Norse bokkr), perhaps from a PIE root *bhugo (source also of Avestan buza \"buck, goat,\" Armenian buc \"lamb\"), but some speculate that it is from a lost pre-Germanic language. Barnhart says Old English buc \"male deer,\" listed in some sources, is a \"ghost word or scribal error.\" \n\nand just for shits and giggles, the word that seems to have meant \"male deer\" for the longest time is:\n\n#hart (n.)\nOld English heorot \"hart, stag, male of the red deer,\" from Proto-Germanic *herutaz (source also of Old Saxon hirot, Old Frisian and Dutch hert \"stag, deer,\" Old High German hiruz, Old Norse hj\u00f6rtr, German Hirsch \"deer, stag, hart\"), perhaps from PIE *keru-, extended form of root *ker- (1) \"horn\" (see horn (n.)). In later times, a male deer after its fifth year, when the crown antler has appeared. The female is a hind (n.).\n\nfrom the Online Etymology Dictionary\n\nAlso noteworthy that UK usage seems to distinguish red deer from fallow or other deer, and STAG is only used for red deer. So it might be that JK Rowling was using stag quite specifically, that Harry's dad turned into a large male red deer and just suchwise was Harry's patronus formed.

A good artist combats this three ways: \n\n1. Planning/skill - by ensuring that the ink is at the right depth and the pigment is packed in, they ensure the tattoo will have a long life. An elaborate tattoo like this was worked over a long time and has \"blank\" spaces hidden in the design, so the skin won't get too irritated and reject the ink.\n\n2. Location - the more stretching and bending the skin does, and the less soft tissue there is underneath it, the more the tattoo fades. That's why you usually see this kind of color work on upper arms/legs, backs, chests, and shoulders. Tattoos on fingers and toes will fade within years, while tattoos in the above locations can last a long, long time\n\n3. Touch ups - like I said, all tattoos fade. Eventually, a touch up will be needed. Usually the original artist will do it, but if they can't for whatever reason, a similarly skilled artist can basically refresh the colours and sharpen fuzzy lines.\n\nSource: I watch too much TV\n\nEdit: autocorrect", "id": "d0cs2f4"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the awesome reply", "id": "d0d6dzq"}, {"comment": "Im also curious about this!", "id": "d0cn5m6"}], [{"comment": "If you got any other work combined with this tattoo, I would imagine it would be a tad bit intimidating for a less skilled artist.

She seemed ticked off a bit and said a few times 'how about we put it here it would look better'.

The only way I would deal with a bad attitude is if the artist was really bringing a strong ink game, and while your piece came out great, I think it's coincidence that the subject matter happened to be a good design and not that the artist managed to take it to the next level.\n\nAs I mentioned in an above comment, I think if you were to have the outline widened and darkened slightly, it might make the piece pop a bit more and remove some of the minor imperfections of the line work.\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate that I'm really not trying to hate on this tat, because I *really* like it a lot!", "id": "czhc6us"}], [{"comment": "Very nice. :)", "id": "czgcvuk"}], [{"comment": "I love it.

I have made a lot of self improvements over the last year or so, so I think my new-found confidence and happiness is the reason I finally pulled the trigger on it. I thought a phoenix seemed really perfect, because of what it symbolizes... I feel like I've kind of been reborn from my own ashes into a better and happier person. Also the wings would go perfectly over the big scar!\n\nThe main reason I wanted to cover it up is there is unfortunately still such a stigma with self-harm and scars, and I am SO far removed from the teenager who used to do that. But unfortunately new people I meet, or people I don't know that well, don't know that. They just see these arm scars and may think, \"Is she mentally unstable..?\" which is not the case. So I'm hoping it will be a positive effect in general in my professional and personal life.\n\nHow deep are your scars? I just had one that was very deep which is the main scar you can see in the photo, but all the little ones faded really well and you would have to look pretty closely to see them. I got the tattoo to cover up the big one that just never faded or changed. Since it's only been 3 years it's very possible your scars might fade more! My smaller ones definitely did. ", "id": "d7tfk8l"}, {"comment": "Thanks for your reply! I'm glad you took the time to write out a nice long one. The scars aren't too deep... really just multiple, bumpy white lines at this point. There's just a lot of them going up and down my arms, thighs, and stomach. I haven't gone swimming in years. I'm actually so uncomfortable with them that I don't even want to post them anonymously online, lol. I guess that says something about wanting to get them covered up. \n\nThe big thing holding me back is advancing my career. I work in an office right now that accepts tattoos, but I want to switch careers, I just have no idea what. All I know is that when I look at my scars, it's not good for me when I get in a depressed state. I'll think about how I couldn't finish the job and I'll think of relapsing. I think getting a artistic, beautiful tattoo will help me because if it's an image I love, I'll never want to cut over it.\n\nAlso, I saw that you posted a nice progress pic! That must be the self improvement you're talking about. So far, I'm down 50lbs since January. I never took a beginning picture though because I hated how I looked. The control you have in life from losing weight/ exercising is so much better than the control from self harming! ;)\n\nJust writing this reply has me leaning towards getting my cover up ideas.

As far as the career thing, you can always cover up your tattoos in an interview or even if the job requires it. And for me I was kind of thinking - I kind of already am tattooed, aren't I? With scars. Do I want a tattoo of scars that I regret, or a beautiful piece of artwork that represents what I've overcome? The choice was easy.\n\nAnd wow, 50 lbs down since January! Congratulations, that is an amazing accomplishment!! Self improvement is fucking awesome right? I used to be so cynical about so many damn things, but I'm finding that part of me is slowly dying because it was just a defense mechanism for my unhappiness. It's easier to feel less when you try to not care about anything.  But fuck all that.\n\nI hope you go through with your tattoo ideas, and share them with us too!

First, the terribly faded tattoos you see today are usually a few decades old, and were done with ink that was developed decades ago and tattoo machines that were developed decades ago. I can't comment specifically on the advancements made in ink and tattoo machines in the last 20-30 years, but one has to imagine they were made.\n\nDoes today's ink behave differently under the skin? Do today's tattooing practices have an effect on the longevity of tattoos? Does it matter if it was done with a 30 year old tattoo machine or one that was constructed this year? Maybe, but the only real way to tell is to wait 20 years and ask all of these people with watercolor tattoos how it's holding up.\n\nUntil then you either dive in, get a water color tattoo, and dig it. Or, you get a traditional tattoo, dig it, and perhaps wonder a bit less about how it'll look in the future.

While you could certainly say that it has not cleared its neighborhood because its smaller mass does not have enough gravitational pull, volume doesn't tell us how much gravity it has. \n\nFun side note- Ceres was considered a planet from 1801-1850s, when they figured out that it fit in better with the asteroids.

If you've seen a photo of Pluto, you'd know that this is the case. In fact, Pluto is 6x larger than the smallest body to be in hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nThe reason why it's not a planet and is instead a dwarf planet is because of another rule by the IAU: the body in question must have \"cleared its neighborhood.\" A bit vague, but the concept is that it must be the biggest object in its orbit by a significant margin, and ejected other competing bodies in the same orbit.

One of the fingers looks like it got stuck in a pencil sharpener. The shading is blocky.\n\nThese are all aspects of that style to my eye.  The shading in traditional tattoos *never* correctly matches any possible light source.  A lot of SJ's hula women had weird shading on their shoulders, for instance.  I think the hands actually look much better than a lot of SJ hands, which seem to always have fingers that are all the same thickness and angle.  Which finger did you think looked bad?\n\nAnother criticism might be that it doesn't include any color, which would fit that style better.  I don't think it's the best tattoo I've ever seen in terms of art, but I think it's at least average.  When I go to /r/cars, I don't expect to only see lamborghinis, and I expect that occasionally a somewhat funny but maybe not extremely technically-advanced modification will be popular.

Totally uneven- look at the left hand, you can see distinct lines in the shading instead of an even fade. Also the fingers being different shapes, that's not even a matter of perspective or light source- they're completely inconsistent. \n\nI guess it's just a matter of opinion. I think it's sloppy and looks like it was free handed without a marker first. At least his black is black, I suppose.\n\nE: forgot part of your question- IMO, all the fingers look bad except the middle left finger.

There are overlaps, but it's kind of like saying there are overlaps among English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh culture. Or maybe like saying that in the 17th century.\n\nThe Plains Indians are a collective term for about 30 different tribes that inhabited the central regions of what is now the United States. War Bonnets were worn by their most respected political and spiritual leaders. Each eagle feather in a bonnet was a gift given to honor their service to their tribe or some great deed. \n\nSo basically, we (meaning White Americans) decimated hundreds of cultures, herded them into small plots of mediocre land, consistently disadvantaged them in education, employment, health care, and other areas for hundreds of years, and now a symbol of great respect and prowess common to a few of these cultures is used as a pretty thing on white people's shoulders, free of any context or meaning.\n\nI'm not telling people whether or not to be offended; I'm not sufficiently Native American to form an opinion on that.

Generally serving its more of an issue - but again, long sleeves fixes that.  Or an ace bandage in a pinch.  My tattoos are snowflakes though so I tend to mostly get comments about how \"tasteful\" they are.  \n\nThere are a lot of factors to consider.  Realistically, what the tattoo is actually of, whether you are male or female and even your ethnicity can make people more likely to make snap judgments. \n\n- edit:  and how *well done* (which, 1000 kudos OP, I wish I had that forethought on my first!) it is.

I confirmed my availability, and later they got back to me to schedule a specific date. (We picked the end of July)\n\nHouston works a little differently than other tattoo artists, he doesn't do any designs/consults before the session (unless it's a cover up). He feels this allows him to design more naturally. I was a little nervous about this because this was my first tat, and I wanted to make sure I loved every bit of it.\n\nThe day of, I went in with like seven photos printed out for reference (most were of previous pieces of his that I liked), two were of the lighthouse that the one in my piece is based off of.\n\nWe just sat and chatted and talked about placement/design/density/etc. for a long time. He was VERY clear that his feelings would not be hurt by any changes I wanted made to a design, which was really reassuring. He drew something up, and I loved it instantaneously. He confirmed that I was completely happy with it, and then started drawing the design on my arm in sharpie.\n\nAfter that, I checked it in the mirror and we got started. It was 5.5 hours. He's very gentle with the needle as far as I can tell, it really didn't hurt (just got a little sore at the end). We chatted for part of it, but mostly I just sat quietly or read. \n\nAll in all, it was an AMAZING experience.
