I don't think it is, but I wouldn't advocate against seeking help if you do like kids.  It might not have come out right above, but my real meaning is this:  You shouldn't be ashamed of who you are.  There's no point in that.  If you don't like something about yourself, then you try to fix it.  Shaming people for who they are is 1.) mean and 2.) never going to fix anybody's problems.", "id": "d9nvbst"}, {"comment": "> pedophiles are still the most persecuted group in Western nations\n\nI think you're overreacting a bit. If it really is just an attraction, and they never act on it, people probably wouldn't find out. I haven't heard a single case of someone being so \"persecuted\" just off attraction alone. Not saying it doesn't happen at all, but I don't think it's as prevalent as you make it sound.\n\nThere is help for people with thoughts like that such as sexuality suppressants and stuff I believe.

What\u2019s the point in not doing the photo?\n\nANSARI: Well, I\u2019d say what happens is, like, you know when I was first starting to act and stuff, like, I heard about some actor that didn\u2019t take photos. And I was like, man,   that seems kind of shitty. Why not? That\u2019s not a big deal. Like, I would take every photo. But it didn\u2019t happen that often. But at a certain point if you\u2019re walking down the street in New York and you\u2019re like somewhat recognizable you get stopped all the time. And you can either take all those photos and then, I used to do that but I started becoming kind of a grumpy person. I would do it and I\u2019d be kind of grumpy about doing it.\n\nDUBNER: Like Alec Baldwin grumpy or just a little bit grumpy?\n\nANSARI: No just like, no, the flash isn\u2019t on. Or like you know, things never go, it\u2019s never like this quick thing that you imagine. And it just keeps, again I hate, like, I\u2019m not complaining about this stuff. Cause I know I\u2019m so lucky in a billion ways. I\u2019m not complaining about this. But you don\u2019t think about, like, oh, you\u2019re with your girlfriend. And every minute you get stopped. And people that stop you when you\u2019re with your friends or your girlfriend, they\u2019re kind of, not rude to them, but they don\u2019t treat them like they\u2019re real people. And they\u2019re like, Hey! Take this of us! And so they\u2019re mean to your other friends sometimes. And your other friends get a little annoyed that, like, every thirty seconds you have to stop and do this whole thing. And you take one picture on the street and then some people see it and they\u2019re like, what\u2019s going on over here? And then they come over. And then eventually there\u2019s like some tourists who are like, who are you? What are you doing? And you\u2019re like, I\u2019m just an actor guy and these people recognized me. And they\u2019re like ok come here. We\u2019re getting one. Ok, I don\u2019t even think you know who I am or what I do but, if you need it. So it becomes this whole thing. So you can either do that or you can have this real moment with a person where you say hey, how are you. Like, what\u2019s your name? Like, thanks for watching my stuff. Like, and I\u2019m happy to do that. That feels like a real thing to me. And I\u2019m happy to do that. I mean I was at a comedy club. And I saw Louis C.K. do this. And he was just like, hey, what\u2019s your name or whatever. And he was like yeah, I just do that. And I\u2019m like oh my God, that\u2019s great. So then you don\u2019t have to be this grump and like take this weird photo. You can just say hi to someone and if they\u2019re cool, they\u2019ll understand. Like, most people get that. You know the other thing is there\u2019s some people I know that are famous to the point where they don\u2019t even walk down the street anymore. They\u2019re always in, like, a black car. And wherever they go they\u2019re in a black car and they get down and they don\u2019t get to be like normal people. And I don\u2019t want to lose that. I want to be able to walk around and be a dude, you know?

Her daughter's death was just an instigator to turn ruthless.) It was only a couple comments, but black people were easily left behind or not fully trusted (e.g. Merle at T-Dog), and the women were fulfilling only the demure housewife or eyecandy role. But I think this changed in S3 when the writers realized that women were dominating the viewership of TWD, and began creating more complex female characters that weren't subjected to the whore or madonna roles, or considered weaker simply because of their biology. \n\nI remember I really loved this show because they don't subject women/children to rape/assault as you would expect in an apocalypse-based show; they've alluded to that being a threat, but have never actually shown it.

The ending of Sopranos I think is really genius and it puts the show over the top as my favorite show of all time.\n\nBut I strongly disagree that Rick is irredeemable or that Tony was a better person in any sense. Rick has acquired a certain tribal warlord bloodthirstiness I will not deny that, but it has never been for his own self aggrandizement and has always been for the safety and security of his family.\n\n[I found this to be a great post about Rick's character.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/4afv9t/spoilers_rick_isnt_a_governor/). My whole original point was how amazing Rick and the groups transformation has been in the context of the whole series. You knew where Breaking Bad and Sopranos were heading, but the Walking Dead you really didn't and we still don't. What they do every step of the way is almost always understandable and not unreasonable and now its getting darker than I thought the show would ever go.\n\n> What Alexandria did crossed a serious line, even within the context of the show\u2019s savagery.\n\n> ..as much as these characters are trying to hold on to their humanity, they\u2019re being stripped of it moment by moment, until only their most basic survival instincts are left. It\u2019s disturbing, but I do think showrunner Scott Gimple is going somewhere with all of this.\n\n>They started a runaway train with the executions last week, and \"we have to finish this!\" can now be used as a justification to take out every single person they run across from here on out. Though maybe that\u2019s part of the idea behind \"we are all Negan,\" as well? Everyone out there has the potential to be in service of a nefarious post-apocalyptic supervillain. There\u2019s reason to murder every single person on the planet that hasn\u2019t sided with Rick and his friends.

For starters, in the comics you don't expect them, as they showed it on tv with all the stupid things the Saviors did. Yes, I am referring to them chaining zombies together and burning wood as stupid, or unnecessary if you will. Also, I really think they did a boring representation of Negan, but I do understand that is due to the censorship. \n\nWhen they do get caught, the whole time Negan is talking, you know it's gonna happen, and you're fucking waiting for it, right? That's what the writer wants, to make you feel something, and for you to worry about who is gonna get killed this. Fucking. Moment. How the fuckity fuck can you feel something when they cut the fucking scene halfway through? My feelings are not gonna be as strong in 6 fucking months, as it is when you have been building a scene for an hour before. It just doesn't make any sense to me! There's a looooot of story upcoming due to this scene, it *is* a turning point in the comics, but people is not gonna focus on that, but on who died instead. Which is a pretty cheap, happens in every series, decision from the staff. \n\nBut again, that's my opinion. I'm really passionate about it, and the butthurt is real from here yo.

Maybe had they done this at the end of episode 9 and then revealed who got Lucille in episode 10 that could have been acceptable. But, by leaving it off entirely at the end of a very tense scene, it felt cheap and poorly done. NOT a good cliffhanger. I don't know if you watch Game of Thrones but they do a lot of cliffhangers too but they do them in such a way you're excited... you just saw something horrible happen and you have no idea what's going to happen next... that's a cliffhanger done well. The writers of TWD need to learn how to appropriately use cliff-hangers. They thought the Glenn under the dumpster thing worked...and in a way it did because at least you saw him lying there and guts being eaten (not his) and that really gave you some sort of \"idea\" at least of what's happening whether you're wrong or right. Does this make any sense? The actors were doing a fantastic job in this finale scene... and it was a letdown not to see it played through to completion at that moment. THAT is why it was insulting and a poorly done cliffhanger, not because it was a cliffhanger to start with.

You're Negan. You got this whole line-up of people that's been giving you nothing but trouble. They're in various states of fear, panic, disarray, and some of them look like they're on death's door already.

And he looks strong-willed as fuck, so getting rid of him will probably be good for group conformity.\n\nThe comics version of the scene was a total victimization of Glenn (which is fine and worked for what Kirkman was going for), but here... it was almost a *gentlemanly agreement* between Negan and Abraham. \"I respect the fact that you are basically volunteering for this, so I shall oblige you.\"\n\nAnd then Daryl had to go and be Daryl.

Like Tyrese, he was just staring at a picture on the wall, I assume thinking \"Twins, twins, twins, what does it mean? Twins... There are 2 of them!\" at which time he gets bit on the arm. At this point they should be clearing areas, armed and with proper armor, before they go sightseeing. \n\n* They *should* be trying to be quiet when the zeds are close, but instead have entire conversations when they're *right in the middle of a fucking HORDE of zombies!* And Rick is the loudest of them all! \n\n* And if zombie guts covered clothing makes them virtually invisible to the zeds, then why aren't they calmly slaying them by the hundred wearing zombie guts covered armor and using Spears?\n\n* Somehow, the second someone becomes a zombie in this show, their Skull turns into paper mach\u00e9 and you can just easily slide a knife in there and magically hit that *one spot* that turns them off like a light switch. People who die and return as a zombie 2 minutes later are also somehow rotten and their clothing is automatically all fucked up. \n\n* This show is based on the Romero zombie movies/world, and in those movies, zombies (like everything on this planet) are *afraid* of fire... But in this show, and seemingly only when they need it to... The zombies are attracted to fire and will stupidly just walk right into it and stand there until they burn up. \n\n* It's been several years since the apocalypse has taken over, yet every time they find a vehicle is miraculously full of good gasoline and the keys are in the ignition. \n\n* Daryl Dixon rides the loudest vehicle you can find, to be a stealthy tracking ranger type with a silent crossbow. \n\n* Everyone is a headshot master, whether they've ever held a gun before or not. \n\n* No one ever uses any Spears?!\n\n\n\n* That baby should be dead. \n\n* All guns have unlimited ammo until the plot demands them to be out. \n\n* People put themselves in dangerous situations that there is absolutely no reason to do so. \n\n* Characters are either good or evil, there is no in between.

An injury can mean death in this world, as evidenced by that stupid girl a few episodes back who twisted her ankle and got eaten later that episode when they were trying to draw the horde to the quarry.\n\nThe whole thing with the horde making the platform shake and Glenn panicking was just drama for the sake of TV. And yes, that was dumb, but it made for a more exciting scene than Maggie calmly dragging herself on to the metal thing and laying down until the situation was sorted.\n\nAs for getting up and killing zombies later if she was injured - maybe that's lazy writing, or maybe her injury wasn't that bad, or it was just adrenaline kicking in.\n\nThere's been dumber things on this show than this metal railing/platform thing so it didn't bother me much."], [7, "I can't wait until the group comes across another group of survivors consisting of all redditors.

Just like this. \n\n* Nobody ever wears any kind of armor... Just a leather jacket would give *some* sort of protection from bites. And most of the time when people get bit its on the arm, and while they're doing something stupid. Like Tyrese, he was just staring at a picture on the wall, I assume thinking \"Twins, twins, twins, what does it mean? Twins... There are 2 of them!\" at which time he gets bit on the arm. At this point they should be clearing areas, armed and with proper armor, before they go sightseeing. \n\n* They *should* be trying to be quiet when the zeds are close, but instead have entire conversations when they're *right in the middle of a fucking HORDE of zombies!* And Rick is the loudest of them all! \n\n* And if zombie guts covered clothing makes them virtually invisible to the zeds, then why aren't they calmly slaying them by the hundred wearing zombie guts covered armor and using Spears?\n\n* Somehow, the second someone becomes a zombie in this show, their Skull turns into paper mach\u00e9 and you can just easily slide a knife in there and magically hit that *one spot* that turns them off like a light switch. People who die and return as a zombie 2 minutes later are also somehow rotten and their clothing is automatically all fucked up. \n\n* This show is based on the Romero zombie movies/world, and in those movies, zombies (like everything on this planet) are *afraid* of fire... But in this show, and seemingly only when they need it to... The zombies are attracted to fire and will stupidly just walk right into it and stand there until they burn up. \n\n* It's been several years since the apocalypse has taken over, yet every time they find a vehicle is miraculously full of good gasoline and the keys are in the ignition. \n\n* Daryl Dixon rides the loudest vehicle you can find, to be a stealthy tracking ranger type with a silent crossbow. \n\n* Everyone is a headshot master, whether they've ever held a gun before or not. \n\n* No one ever uses any Spears?!\n\n\n\n* That baby should be dead. \n\n* All guns have unlimited ammo until the plot demands them to be out. \n\n* People put themselves in dangerous situations that there is absolutely no reason to do so. \n\n* Characters are either good or evil, there is no in between. You're either a murderous, abusive, snarky asshole whose bent on the destruction of the group, or you're part of the goody two shoes group.

If you are stuck somewhere for hours, are you going to choose to stay on the larger platform with railings and room to sit/lay down, and a better vantage point of your surroundings,  or are you going to choose to stand on a skinny metal railing with no handholds?  Enid's purpose was to fashion together some kind of rope using the church crap so they could climb down the other side of the wall where presumably there were few or no zombies and they would have a better chance to escape. \n\nI can't remember if Maggie got hurt or not before she got up there, but it sounds like from some comments she was, so again, it makes more sense for her to stay where there's at least a railing and room to hang out.\n\nIf the platform was really about to collapse, Maggie would have obviously gone onto the metal thing, or if there was no other option, jumped over the wall and probably broken some bones, which would probably have ended up killing her eventually as she'd not be able to run/fight off walkers. So it made more sense for her to stay put until the horde had passed. An injury can mean death in this world, as evidenced by that stupid girl a few episodes back who twisted her ankle and got eaten later that episode when they were trying to draw the horde to the quarry.\n\nThe whole thing with the horde making the platform shake and Glenn panicking was just drama for the sake of TV. And yes, that was dumb, but it made for a more exciting scene than Maggie calmly dragging herself on to the metal thing and laying down until the situation was sorted.\n\nAs for getting up and killing zombies later if she was injured - maybe that's lazy writing, or maybe her injury wasn't that bad, or it was just adrenaline kicking in.\n\nThere's been dumber things on this show than this metal railing/platform thing so it didn't bother me much.", "id": "d024jfn"}], [{"comment": "I can't wait until the group comes across another group of survivors consisting of all redditors.

As an adjective from early 15c.\n\nThe term was used to describe country folk, who historically took the longest to be Christianized. Thus the term 'pagan' became loosely associated with the religions and traditions practiced by those country folk. In order to more easily integrate them into Christendom the church incorporated many of their traditions into Christian holidays. This is a pretty reductionist view of what occurred but this is Reddit and I'm not being paid, so...\n\nEaster - Eostre, the Germanic goddess of fertility, whose symbols, among many, were rabbits and eggs.\n\nChristmas - \"Yuletide\" = Northern Germanic tradition of Yule/a large majority of Christmas traditions are taken straight from Northern Germanic pagan traditions, including Christmas trees, the exchange of gifts, the use of lights, and holly/mistletoe.\n\n~~Candlemas - Beltane/Celtic springtime fire festivals.~~ On further research Candlemas seems to have originated in the 4th Century CE and is as original a Christian holiday as you can get. Romans themselves would have referred to Christians as some variant of pagan, and also \"atheists,\" since Christianity didn't become the majority religion in the empire until the 5th Century CE. May Day might be more appropriate.\n\nHalloween - Ol' Hallows Eve, the word \"Halloween\" is attributed to a 17th Century Scottish poem, a shortening of \"Allhallow-even\"; the day preceeds All Saints' Day in Catholic tradition, which appropriated many aspects from the Celtic holiday of Samhain (sa-wynn), which celebrated(es) the dead/ancestors and was the last day of the Celtic calendar celebrated on the night of Oct. 31st - Nov. 1st.", "id": "d8i74yl"}, {"comment": "Well your right on both accounts!

If you have any siblings I'm sure thinking of them dressing up in sexy costumes is not they type of thing you do on the regular. Again, as I said, not disappointed or discriminating, but thats just not something that I enjoy visualizing about my sister. If that's your job, great! Someone has to do it, and there's nothing wrong with that. But I'm sure whatever siblings you have didn't enjoy thinking of you dressing in these costumes. They aren't being judgmental, its just clear that's not the kind of thing siblings like to talk about with each other. And for you to assume that I would treat my brother differently is crazy. I was  obviously using the example of my sister because the picture here is a girl, and that's what we were talking about. If I found out my brother was doing something like this, I would find it equally awkward. Because, again, thinking of siblings doing sexy things is not on the top of the list of things I like to do. You know what I'm trying to say, and just want to make me out to a bad guy. I promise, I really don't care what you do. Any job that makes you happy is great, seriously go for it!

However, prior to Bub, there did not appear to be any kind of *personality* attached to the remnant memories - in 'regular' zombies, remnant memories basically just did two things: Affect 'idle' behavior, where in the absence of living humans to hunt, the dead would settle into crude 'mimicing' of living activites and secondly, make them just a little bit more dangerous when on the hunt, because they were able to 'remember' hiding spots, vaguely remember how things like doorknobs work, and so forth.\n\n'Bub' of course was different, and seemed to have an actual 'mind' - but it's suggested in the confrontation with Rhodes that Logan's 'domestication' process involves '15 hours of fancy surgery that only a handful of people are trained to do', so Bub probably had that, along with supervision/training by a scientist who'd done more to study the zombie phenomenon than anyone else, to become what he was.\n\nThis is why I feel 'land' went a step too far in the 'smart zombie' direction with Big Daddy. Big Daddy seems even 'smarter' than Bub but appears to have developed intelligence and emotion 'on his own', which never sat completely well with me.\n\nAll that said, I completely agree that the S1 / Romero style \"remnant memories\" zombies are much more frightening, but also more *tragic* somehow.", "id": "d1n2iy6"}, {"comment": "Some zombies also used tools to smash the windows to the mall they were holed up in.\n\nAnd there was the kid zombie in the very first scene who picked up a teddy bear.", "id": "d1mxbe1"}, {"comment": "But the zombie memory thing is still being explored and talked about in season 3.

When characters get all down and wanting to die, I see it as a sign of weakness in the context of the show. The main characters are always giving motivational speeches about \"surviving\" and \"pushing forward\" and when characters try to go against that, it makes me dislike them. \n\nWith Carol specifically, I was disappointed that she allowed herself to be in a relationship with an abusive asshole even AFTER the entire world had gone to shit. She was even cowardly enough to kill and burn two people without consulting anyone and not owning up to it until hard-pressed. When she reappeared after being kicked out, she seemed strong and smart, but still sensitive and caring. Now, she has gone back to making poor, weak decisions that affect not just her, but all of those who love her. I understand her reasons, but part of living in their world is being able to be strong and survive. Sometimes you have to turn off certain parts of your brain to do that. \n\nShe was one-dimensional early in the show, but in a different way. I think she is an awesome character, don't get me wrong, but that doesn't mean that I have to like her.

She was held down in every way by an abusive husband, lost him, and then lost their daughter.  She had reason to believe that only the strongest, most utilitarian, most deadly people could survive anymore, and she let it mold her, but that's not who she always was.  She's a talented homemaker, and Sophia was a loved child, even in a fearful home.  Love in the apocalypse is murdering people... and protective Carol took the concept to heart.\n\nTheme-wise, this little arc is leading the audience to understand the importance of compromise and caring for the emotional needs of your friends as well as their physical ones.

They were all killed at some point, either by walkers or humans, not sure. Once he lost everything he loved, he emotionally broke. He evolved into the loving Sociopath we see today. Seriously though, these are the traits of a sociopath:\n\n* Charming - I'm a straight male and the dude can charm my pants off. I mean that smile, that salt and pepper beard - I can only hope I look that good in 10 years.\n\n* Intelligent - he's definitely intelligent. Just take a look at the work and effort put into his introduction during last season's finale. \n\n* Shallow emotions/lack of empathy - He simply does not give a shit about anyone or their feelings. If this season's premiere wasn't clear enough,  [](/s \"just look at the way he talked about Dwight and his (ex)wife to Darryl while Dwight was standing right there.\")  The only thing he loves in this world is Lucille.\n\n* Cold, calculating nature - go ahead and take a shot at him. Believe that you are sacrificing yourself for the greater good. He's not going to kill you. He's going to kill someone you care about in a brutal fashion and make you watch. And then he's going to use you and the rest of those you care about for his own personal gain. That's why all the communities are now giving him half their shit. That's cold and very calculated. \n\n* Narcissism/grandiose self image - this guy loves himself. He sees himself as superior and as a fitting ruler to several communities (Saviors, Hilltop, Kingdom, and now Alexandria).\n\n* Sexual deviance - see above spoiler. \n\n* Despotic/Authoritarian - do I really need to go any further? He rules with an iron (fist) and a barbed-wire wrapped Louisville Slugger.\n\n* Secretive - we don't know shit about Negan and I sincerely doubt many of his people do.\n\n* Lawfulness (believe it or not) - he has a set of rules. Though they may be a fucked up set of rules, he believes that they should be followed to a T... with \"no exceptions.\" We also see a little of this when he was talking to Dwight in the last episode. [](/s \"He told Dwight that the pussy bar was open and that he could have anyone he wants, as long as they say 'yes'.\") Leads me to believe this is another one of his rules.\n\nThere are plenty more characteristics, but these ones really stood out to me. We're only 3 episodes in and he clearly demonstrated all of these. Dude's a total sociopath and that's what makes him a great villain - the fact that he lacks any kind of empathy. He simply does not care about you or your feelings and has no problem putting a swift (or slow) end to your existence. Or even worse - putting an end to the innocent person you love's existence.

Negan almost never has that problem because he regularly kills a person when he introduces himself, just to show that he \"means business.\" Negan would never have stood for Spencer stealing supplies *twice* now, especially the time with the guns.\n\nNegan has all the supplies, and never has to do his own work (in that regard). Rick is the person that, on the *last day they need supplies,* will go out and find them himself. Negan is impressive precisely because he runs a smooth operation in the way Rick never could, because Negan has a zero tolerance policy for breaking the rules. Meanwhile, Rick is impressive because he's managed to keep the group alive while keeping their humanity alive, because he's done a lot of dark shit, but he's never gone to the depths that Negan has gone to.

The frontal bone (where glenn was hit) is much much harder than you would think.\n\n\nHere's the anatomical breakdown of Glenn's bashing.\n\n\n**First Hit**:\n\nThe frontal bone is fractured, or possibly shattered. Not completely caved in at all.\n\n\n**Second Hit**:\n\nIf struck in the same place, frontal bone is now caved in. Skull fragment should be damaging the frontal lobe. Not necessarily a death blow. There's records of patients enduring frontal lobe damage while maintaining consciousness. Whether or not they still retain the same cognitive ability is questionable though. The realism of the eyeball popping out you might ask? Expulsions of anything in the human body is typically a result of intense pressure rather than blunt force trauma as seen on the show. Glenn's eyeball shouldn't have been extruding. If anything, it should be crushed.\n\n\n**Third Hit**:\n\nPretty self explanatory. A blow to the side of the temple successfully inflicts enough force to literally make the brain crash against the inside of the skull thus rendering Glenn unconscious (most likely dead due to the current trauma he was already enduring). Negan's repeated blows finally destroys the brain, of course. The shaking of Glenn's hands were simply a reaction of nerves.\n\n\nI just graduated from medical school somewhat recently and we actually had a patient come in that suffered a blow to the head from an aluminum bat during a physical altercation.

Real dreadlocks take a ton of care and attention (especially in the beginning) to \"train\".

I mean, tara didn't even know denise died man.. but towards the beginning of the episode, tara quoted glenn to heath, and that was pretty sad to me. if you put aside the time thats passed and whatever pacing issues may come up, these characters are written to be very close. like, almost as if they're real people with real relationships to people who would have been strangers if not for the apocalypse.. \n\nwhen tara walked up to the gate, with the sunglasses and the happy music goin I'll add, seeing eugene unable to hold his tears got me a lil bit.

Abe having lost his family, especially in the way he did (his wife being terrified of his savagery), and searching for a greater cause was also incredible. Tyreese was just an awesome all around character, probably one of the most well-rounded in the show who never got the chance to spread his wings and got one of the dumbest deaths in the show. \n\nI'm getting frustrated with this because there's a number of characters who are basically running their course (Darryl, Carol, Morgan) but they stick around after their welcome while we lose people like Ty, Abe, and Glenn, shit, include Noah and Beth too.

I liked how irrational he acted in the recent episode. Punching N was not a smart reaction and it was a mistake but it FELT in character to what Daryl would do. So many fans get angry when characters make these mistakes (look at all the \"FUCK DARYL\" posts) but I think they make the characters more human. Early season Daryl was irrational, prone to outbursts, and snarky. He has changed and matured a lot but I still like how occasionally there are hints to his rebellious past that shine through. \n\nThese faults don't make the characters bad, they make the characters more believable as people. I think part of the reason I, like you, also enjoy some smaller, more broken, characters is because they make far more mistakes than the main cast; and their mistakes aren't dragged out.

To really tie a bow on Carol's arc, I think Carol needs to express that the way she treated Sam, and Sam's fate, was ultimately the biggest trigger in making Carol rethink the way she was acting.

Put him in \"jail\"?); I think it was one of those \"scare some sense into the kid\" b/c *Carol* realized the truth about Alexandria: that **none** of these people would survive against walkers making it in, let alone other people (hence her weapon recon so she could be prepared just in case).\n\nShe \"treated Sam\" as she did the kids in the prison: she was fiercely protective, even if that meant telling them some hard truths (letting Sam be over b/c she knew Pete was abusive was also a way to help him). Her biggest regret was failing her daughter; she wasn't going to let that happen to any other kid.

She told him she was going to take him outside, and leave him for the walkers to eat him.  And I definitely think Carol is the type of person that is going to remember saying that to him, and feel some guilt about it given how he died.\n\nAnd to your other point, in the prison, Carol tried to train the kids to use weapons so that they could survive.

She experienced a man like him, which makes her particularly aware of what they're capable of when they feel threatened, and she knew Pete felt threatened by Rick and Co.\n\nAnd what happens? He comes out swinging (literally), killing Deanne's husband b/c he got in between him and Rick, which proved Carol right about Pete.

It might not be rationale for Carol to feel guilty about Sam, but I think it is understandable that she could.

We might just have to agree to disagree, but I'll give you my perspective anyway.\n\nJust because Pete ended up killing someone, and verifying Carol\u2019s claim that Rick was going to have to kill Pete, doesn\u2019t mean that this is how the scenario had to play out.  There were so many other options Rick and Deana could have tried to solve the Pete problem.  Maybe some sort of intervention by the town leaders with Pete and his family.  Some mandatory therapy (Denise was a psychiatrist remember). And yes, even, putting Pete in a homemade prison for a while.  I get that this a TV show, and none of these are exactly exciting to watch or would create good drama, and they might not have even worked.  But these are all things that could be tried first, but instead Carol says to Rick, \u201cHey, you are going to have to kill this guy.\u201d  How about we take a few steps back Carol, and say something like \u201cHey, you are going to have to deal with this issue,\u201d or \u201cHey, we need to help this family before this situation blows up.\u201d But instead, Carol jumps all the way to \u201cyeah, this guy has to die.\u201d  It just really speaks to me, and shows how hardened and extreme Carol had become prior to reaching Alexandrea.  That was my only point in bringing this up originally.  That this statement by Carol illustrates her extreme point of view, and from this extreme point of view, how do we believably reach the Carol we have now that doesn\u2019t want to kill?  \n\nAnd about Karen and David, how was she right about them?  Her killing them did not stop anyone from getting sick.  If they died and turned to zombies, so what?  They were quarantined, and the others survivors would be expecting their death as a possibility and be ready to take care of them as walkers.  If Carol really wanted to stop the spread of the sickness in its tracks, she would have had to kill almost everyone that came into contact with the sick kid, which was like that one whole section of the prison.\n", "id": "d1gkpts"}, {"comment": "How do you not think Pete deserved to die?

You can't do that if you're dead can you? I'm not growin a garden, but, you killed my people, a whole damn lot of them.  More than I'm comfortable with and for that, for that you're gunna pay.\" \n\nIts pretty clear that he wants to keep as many of them alive as possible because more people equals more resources for himself.  Its because they killed so many of his people, that they now have to pay with someone's life.  \n\nNegan's control comes from the fact that he's willing to squash any act of defiance.  Rick's group working with Hilltop and killing his men is a massive act of defiance, so he makes it clear that it won't be tolerated by killing one of them.  Its the exact same way Negan is depicted in the comics as well, he gives other groups a chance to cooperate by surrendering half their shit, if they disobey, one person gets killed.   Disobey again, another person dies, etc.\n\nEdit:  And just to add, I'm not saying the Saviors have never killed other people from the other communities before.

Negan at the very least is a sociopath, probably closer to psychopath.  He's got no remorse for killing and actually enjoys it.

Just because Rick is willing to do all this messed up stuff for the sake of his family and friends doesn't make him a hero.  The Governor was willing to kill all of Rick's people so his people could live somewhere protected.  Does that make the Governor a hero?  \n\nWhat I'm really getting at here is that there is no clear good guys and bad guys in this show.  Its just different people employing different levels of violence to \"protect\" their people.  Rick did it, The Governor did it and now Negan is doing it.

Daryl blows them up. That was easy. Don't want to get blown up? Don't threaten peoples' lives. Negan gang shows up at Hilltop and stabs the leader because their offering was light.

You don't go into a commune, kill a 16 year old, stab the leader, demand delivery of his head, demand half their shit forever, kidnap one of them, and not expect some repercussions.

He's an intensely interesting character IMO, and I think people are really glossing over the past few seasons. You don't have to give long ass speeches to convey meaningful shit. Daryl is like a character study in repeated trauma and what it does to human will, as well as why the drive to survive and hope can seem so fucking detrimental sometimes. Even when he has repeatedly watched people he loves die, he still manages to find a reason to believe that people can be good. He still finds a reason to take a chance and trust. \n\nSure, it leads him to more heartbreak, but isn't that kind of the point? How many times can you be burned before you stop giving a fuck about anyone? Even now, through not speaking, Daryl demonstrates that he hasn't reached that point yet (morse code, etc). Not speaking tells us far more than anything he said would have. \n\nDaryl is most assuredly a fan favorite, yeah. But there's a reason, and not everyone loves him because \"omg badass\".

Everyone in the show has been through some fucked shit but they all move or at least find some sort of peace. No in the writers room seems to have an idea of what they want to do with him so they just kind of keep him the same. He's forgettable at this point. ", "id": "dape5i2"}, {"comment": ">Daryl is broken but he's been that way for too long. There's no attempt to advance him from that point and he's just boring. Everyone in the show has been through some fucked shit but they all move or at least find some sort of peace. \n\nNot everyone deals with grief and pain the same way. Maybe cause I deal with severe depression I can empathize with him, but I think they are pretty clear that he's lost more than anyone else. First off, he was abused as a kid and his brother who seemed to be the one that stuck up for him ended up running away when they were young and their dad just took it out on Daryl (s03e10). \n\nAt some point Daryl and Merle are reunited and they become drifters. Its clear they aren't that close but Daryl has always been submissive to his brother and always did what he said. When the apocalypse hit they fended for themselves for a while until meeting the Atlanta group. This is the moment that Daryl stopped listening to his brother because Merle wanted to rob them but Daryl decided they should join them (The Walking Dead: Survival Instincts. I do not recommend the game). \n\nWhen Rick handcuffed Merle and they left him to die, Daryl lost his brother again. All the pain of his brothers original abandonment came back to him, but he knew his brother was alive and he wasn't going to let him go. Well, he loses the trail and is forced to let it go but his need to search for someone is redirected into the search for Sophia. He puts everything he's got into finding her. He projects his need to find his brother into finding this little girl. \n\nHe builds a bond with Carol through this but once it's revealed that Sophia had been bitten and turned. He becomes distant both figuratively and literally when he sets up a camp far away from the others. He pushes Carol away because he thinks he failed her and if he failed finding Sophia then it only makes his failure finding his brother worse. \n\nTime goes on and he and Rick get a little closer when things between Rick and Shane are stressed and Rick starts asking Daryl for help. When they lose the farm and Rick tells everyone that Dr. Jenner told him that everyone turns no matter what, everyone feels betrayed but even when Carol expresses distaste for what Rick did, Daryl is ok with it. He's probably used to being lied to by his brother and it only reinforces his bond with Rick. I know that sounds dumb but familiarity is a huge factor in relationships. \n\nSo time goes on between season 2 and 3 and it really shows that these people are family, including Daryl. He and Rick are only getting closer. When Lori died Daryl steps up to go get baby formula because he's not willing to let another little girl die. He thinks Carol is dead and even leaves a Cherokee rose on her grave which was important between them (s02e04 s03e05). This is the first time he loses Carol but He seems at peace with it. \n\nHe opens up about losing his mother when he was about Carl's age just after Carl lost his (s03e6). He finds Carols knife in the neck of a walker and it gives him hope that she's alive. When he finds a dead walker blocking the door to a closet he's sure she's in there but he seems to be struggling with the idea of opening it because he doesn't want to dash those hopes of her being alive if he finds her dead. He pushes past that and opens the door prepared to kill her if she turned. He discovers her alive and takes her back to the group. \n\nWhen he discovers Merle is alive he reverts back to old Daryl and despite being told that he tortured Glenn whom Daryl cares about, he still wants his brother back. This would fix all his pain because he would get back what he initially lost which is the root to his emotional trauma. He casts aside Rick who took Merles place as Daryls brother because he's not needed now, he has the real thing. Well, Daryl realizes that Merle is Merle and those people back at the prison are too important to him to let go. He can't be the one that leaves, so he goes back forcing them to take Merle in. \n\nThat confrontation in the woods with Merle gave Daryl the confidence to stand up for what he thinks when Rick confides to him that the Governor wants Michonne delivered to him. Daryl doesn't like it and expresses that opinion but still falters when Rick decides they are going to do it. Merle is the obvious choice for the job and Daryl goes and talks to his brother for what he would later find out was the last time they spoke to each other.\n\n Daryl tells Merle that all he wants is his brother back. This is Daryls ultimate goal. This coversation ends with Merle telling him to get away and so Daryl does what he's told. Merle goes off to do the dirty work but when Rick sees reason Daryl has to track him down. This is the second time Daryl has to hunt his brother and he's not going to let him get away. Well, Merle is killed by the Governor when he ambushes them at the drop off and Daryl has to put him down. This is the first time we see him cry because everything has built up to this point. All the times he's lost someone even if it was brief like with Carol, he still felt like it was Merle and now he's gone for good. Despite who Merle was, Daryl loved him unconditionally. \n\nWhen they take in all the people from Woodbury and eventually start collecting more and more people at the prison, Daryl becomes the town hero and even has his own fanboy Patrick (s04e01). Bob gets another fanboy who was dating Beth killed. Daryl obviously liked that kid and they had a light friendship. He tries to console Beth but she doesn't seem to be bothered. She's gone through her own shit and doesn't seen to be as hurt as Daryl is. \n\nPatrick dies and kills 12 people at the prison. More people are sick and dying from Patrick's sickness and once again Daryl is going to save them because he can't let all those people go after he just got to know so many of them. He even tells Michonne that she should stick around more often and get to know the people there (s04e04). He picks up a stone (i think it was jasper) for a widow back at the prison to put on her husband's grave. He knew what she was looking for and picked that one just for her. \n\nLater in the episode his faith in people is strained when Bob can't control his alcoholism and sacrifices valuable bag space that they needed for the medicine to stash a bottle of booze. Daryl nearly kills Bob over this and reflects on bringing him to the prison in the first place when he looks at the stone again while waiting for the crew to load up in the van. Everything seems to be going great once all the people are administered medicine and Daryl probably felt like he actually acomplished something good after so many mistakes. Well, too bad cause Rick left Carol out on her own and knock, knock, it's the Governor again. He directly and indirectly kills nearly everyone at the prison and when Daryl and Beth escape he has no way of knowing whether anyone survived. This is the moment Daryl really broke.\n\n Before losing the prison he was still able to joke once in a while although infrequent. Now he's shut down but Beth gets inside. They spend time together but once he starts to really care about her she's snatched away. At this point why care about anything? Every single person he ever let's in is taken away from him. So why not join up with These new guys? They remind him of how he and Merle were when they were drifters, so he goes along.\n\n Well Daryl decides he's going to go off on his own when the guys he was with finally track down the asshole who killed one of them. Daryl almost misses it but sees that that asshole was Rick. Daryl tries to stick up for him but gets beaten for it. They over come the Claimers and kill them all. Daryl watches Rick brutalize a man for attempting to rape Carl. He watched a man display so much anger over someone who threatened someone he loves. When Daryl tries to comfort Rick telling him anyone would have done what he did, Rick just says, \"no, not that.\" Then he says, \"You're my brother Daryl.\" Rick acknowledges their bond and gives Daryl a new brother. He's not going to let this one go(s04e16).\n\n When Carol saves them from the Termites Daryl is reunited with her. That's another person he's lost that he got back. Soon after, Daryl spots a car with the same symbol as the one that took Beth. He and Carol search for Beth in Atlanta. This is when Carol teaches Daryl a rudimentary morse code (s05e06). Carol gets captured by this group and Daryl is forced to retreat and collect himself. He has a plan to get Beth and Carol brings it to the group and they head out to save them. The plan goes well and just as Beth is about to be back she's killed. He does what Rick did when Carl was in danger and kills Dawn but it's too late and Beth is dead. \n\nThis all familiar feeling of loss is back for the nth time. He loses people, they come back, but then he loses them again. When they make it to Alexandria Aaron shows Daryl that there are people out there worth saving but that's put to a stop when they fall victim to a trap set by the Wolves. Daryl and Aaron are trapped inside a car and Daryl is ready to sacrifice himself for Aaron because Aaron is his new friend and he would rather die than lose him. Morgan gets them both out alive and they move on. ", "id": "dapp2di"}, {"comment": "When a massive herd threatens the group the Wolves attack and set off the horn on one of their attack trucks. This makes a large portion of the herd break off to Alexandria. Daryl wants to go help back home and despite being told that its better that they finish luring the rest of the herd away, Daryl goes home to help. I think he couldn't just stand idly by while people he cared about were in imminent danger. He decides against that decision and seems at peace with letting them do their part while he did his. This results in him meeting Dwight. \n\nHe sympathized with their plight to get away from an opressive group and offers to take them to safety and all he got out of that was his stuff stolen and stranded on his own. People are getting worse and Daryl is too caring. He makes it back home in one piece and saves the day. \n\nHe and Rick meet Jesus (s06e10) and they learn about the Saviors.

I think the big part of the ratings decline is the questionable decisions/story telling.  I don't have cable and generally do not pirate shows.  For the last four years and up until this year I was buying a \"season pass\" to watch the show.  The crappy \"Glenn under a dumpster\" cliffhanger and then the decision to drag out the obvious pushed me to really consider not watching.  The terrible way they ended the season finalized my decision to not spend the money on the show.  Now we watch a few days later without spending our money on the show. \n\nPeople don't like the show being compared to Game of Thrones but they are arguably the two most popular shows on television right now.  Budgets and resources aside, the comparisons are inevitable and GoT is better in every fashion.  And without posting spoilers, none of the cliffhangers for GoT really feel \"cheap.\"  They feel natural and part of a normal progression of the storyline.  \n\nIf any characters storyline is bumming me out it wasn't Glenn's and it isn't Daryl's.  It is Rick's and Negan's.  Negan seems more like a drama queen than a really scary guy at this point (JDM nailed the final scene in last seasons finale...too bad they crapped on it with the actual ending).  But his one liners and flamboyant attitude are more annoying than anything at this point.  I \"get\" why Rick is completely crippled by this guy at this point but I don't think he would/should be.  I'm still not sure why Negan hasn't been/wasn't taken out by his own guys by now.  I don't care if \"he protects them\" the way he treats them would be enough that one of them would off'd him by now and the others would have stepped up.  (The exchange between Dwight and the guy running away hints that there is an issue with some of them).\n\nNot to mention that Negan taunts himself as a man of his word but didn't \"cut out the kids other eye and feed it to his dad.\"  If he was such a crazy badass that should have happened.  Instead, the show went for the \"shock\" and killed two characters and now leave \"blame\" at Daryl's feet.\n\nIt is 5 AM and I started rambling.  My decision to no longer watch live and support the show financially was based on (what is, IMO) crappy/lazy story telling and I would imagine that is the case for most people.
