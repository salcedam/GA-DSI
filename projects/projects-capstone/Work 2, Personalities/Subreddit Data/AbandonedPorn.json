If the cave is 150 feet high and 150 feet wide and goes straight for a football field's length, what makes that dangerous. I can understand with the turns and stuff and getting disoriented and smaller areas deeper in the cave. I also et that some caves open with some really tricky things.

We buy old houses and apartments, renovate them, then rent them out.  It's a good business.\n\nEven when you DIY most of it, a 1,000 square foot apartment can easily run over $10,000 in materials.

Who knows what kind of work the foundation would need.\n\nMy very rough estimate would be at least $10 million on a place like this.  It's too big to DIY, you'd have to hire quite a few people.  There would be considerable upkeep after it was finished, too.\n\nYou might be able to make some money using it as a hotel, but there are plenty of costs there, too.

Probably not skylights in an old barn like that.\n\nI think there are a few answers more likely than refraction. \n\n1) The lines actually *are* parallel, and just look like they're converging due to an optical illusion caused by either the lens used (12mm, according to the [original image source](https://500px.com/photo/6668512/magic-by-andreas-s)) or the post-processing done to eliminate the curvature caused by said wide-angle lens. \n\n2) The photograph is a combination of several photographs that were taken several minutes apart, so some of the beams are from one photo, and some are from another (still, the apparent convergence seems large enough that even several minutes wouldn't be enough to account for it).\n\n3) The beams of light are fake, inserted by the photographer after-the-fact. \n\nPersonally, I'm leaning toward #1. That is, the lens-correction part. Lenses like that tend to cause some distortion near the edges, and since there's a brick wall in the background, it would likely have been pretty obvious, so the photographer likely did some correction work after the fact. \n\nFor example, this image was taken with a fairly wide-angle lens: http://i.imgur.com/vGjdGr9.jpg\n\nYou can see the curve of the sides.\n\nHere it is kind-of corrected in Photoshop (a little too far, really, but it illustrates what's happening): http://i.imgur.com/ETyDC1g.jpg\n\nYou can see that the center is mostly unchanged, but the edges are expanded a bit. I think that's what's happening in the photo with the light rays. The end points of the rays stay the same, but the edges are brought out as part of the lens-correction process. As a result, the parallel lines now look like they're converging toward the wall.\n\n", "id": "d97c39w"}, {"comment": "I figured it out!!! Finally, it was bugging me.

But I did find out more about the house.  \n\nIt's actually not in Vaksvik, as I misremembered, but in Stordal -- about 10 kilometers further in the fjord. The farm is called *Holtleitet*, [here](https://goo.gl/maps/xYtHFTFD7Dw) it is in Google Maps/StreetView.  \n\nThe house was built in 1896 by Petter Thoresen Holtleite (born 1875) who was a carpenter. His workshop had a gasoline-powered bandsaw, lathe and bore, and 2-3 apprentices. Obviously, he did the woodcarving on his own house. (In Norwegian, this kind of decorations is called *snekkerglede*: \"carpenter's joy\" or \"carpenter fun\".)  \n\n[This](http://digitaltmuseum.no/021016258489) is a photo of him.  \n\nClearly he found joy in this kind of work. He submitted woodcarved covers for a photo album to an exhibition in Bergen, and received commendations for his work. He was also artistic, he played the cornet and was a founding member of the local marching band. There's even a story of how in 1893, he rowed, skied and walked many miles to the nearest army base to buy used instruments for the band. (Source: *Farne tider* by Jostein Sande, 1989, page 374.)  \n\nTo those saying the house looks haunted, there actually is a local legend saying it was even when it was inhabited. Not by a ghost, though, but a *bokk*, a underworldly spirit creature that attaches itself to certain locations. There was such a *bokk* on this farm, called *Holtleitet-bokkjen*. Horses would refuse to pass the house unless the rider dismounted and walked the horse while holding a knife before him to \"cut\" a clean passage. After they had passed the house, the horse would act normally again. (Source: *Stordal i ord og toner* by Peter J\u00f8svold, 1948, page 102.) There is also a mention that passing by the house at night, you'd feel the weight of a large animal on your back, this is ascribed to an [utburd or myling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myling). Most people went off the road and into the field when passing at night, because the field had bits of steel buried in each corner. Evil spirits are \"allergic\" to steel. (Source: *Folkeminne fr\u00e5 Sunnm\u00f8re* by J\u00f8rgen Gjerding, 1921, page 70.)  \n\nUnfortunately, I haven't been able to find out when Petter died, what happened to his two daughters, or who owns the house now.\n\nEDIT: He died in 1953, so I'm guessing that's when the house was abandoned. According to some sources he had nine children, so I'm assuming some of his grandchildren own it today.  \n\nEDIT2: Good news: I found a [newspaper article from 1996](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7261/26752443172_895afc4b55_k.jpg) about the house, it seems Petter's grandson is also a carpenter with a love for the old craft. (The top left photo is his work on his own house.) In 1996 he said he was fixing the house, and in fact you can see how it's a lot nicer today than it was in 1996. Maybe someday it'll be back to its former glory!  \n\nAlso, I google the current owner and apparently he knows my dad!

But frankly its war record was mediocre at best. In the European theatre they had a fairly low kill to death ratio compared to other American planes, which is especially bad considering how \"modern\" of an aircraft it was supposed to be. Luckily it seemed to do much better in the Pacific theatre, but again the Japanese Zero was an old plane and by the middle of the war pretty much all of our planes were doing great against it. \n\nThe p-38 had twice the engines making it twice as expensive, but wasn't twice as fast and really just a larger target. The P-51 Mustang for example cost half as much and had just as long as range and was also a far more agile and successful fighter, and also did well in a lot of other roles the the P-38 was designed to do.\n\nHey I am not trashing on the P-38 at all, and it certain was \"iconic\" no doubt about that. Just because I believe the P-51 was \"better\" doesn't mean I think the Lightening was no good. I'm just saying there is a good reason the Lightening is over shadowed by other planes, it had some good things going for it for sure, but every plane did, and frankly a lot were more impressive.

It wasn't good against German fighters at all. It wasn't really meant to be a pure fighter either I don't think. Yet like you said our top ace got more kills with it than any other plane. It sort of suggests that the plane was quirky but if you used it right had many advantages, although I don't know if that is true", "id": "dav0jfs"}, {"comment": "Early/midwar japanese fighters were suceptible to being out run and out performed at high altitude, so the Americans could use their superior speed and the much heavier weight of their planes to dive on japenese planes and use the momentum to disengage without committing to manuevering fights.  You probably know that.  Once we started to develop the tactics and plane performance to dictate the terms of every engagement with speed and wingman tactics instead of pure manueverability(stuff we learned in part from the British and especially the Luftwaffe), we started to rack up the kills with pretty much every plane we sent against them.  Then it was a matter of attrition and the lack of trained Japanese pilots making it to the front lines while we sent our experienced ones home to train up the newbies instead of waiting for them to die in repeated engagement.\n\nI read one of the preferred p38 tactics due to the poor high speed handling, fantastic engine power, and good stall characteristics due to the tail design, was to bait the enemy plane into a climb behind them where they would stall out and the superior stall characteristics of the p38 would allow for a reversal and easy shot on a nearly stalled target.  Not sure how true that is just something I read.\n\nSimply put, we never developed a distinct performance or tactical advantage on german aircraft, and we ended up beating them more or less purely on attrition.  The p51 was a good aircraft, dont get me wrong, but it was a lot more competative with german aircraft than the Japanese mass production ones.  By the time the Japanese had comparable aircraft like the ki-84, they didnt have many good pilots to fly it nor did they have the resources to keep it working at optimal capacity.\n\nSo the p38 enjoyed a lot of advantages over the Japanese and was the closest thing we had to a land based interceptor during that middle period(the p51 and p47 being designed as escort or air superiority fighters i.e. they were designed to be used offensively and from positions of energy advantage built up over a long time instead of in response to a threat already at altitude), and that's where he racked up those kills.  Quite of few of the 40 credited to him are bombers, and most of the fighter kills are much slower aircraft that typically operate at lower altitude than the p38, even if they were far more manueverable, which made them comparitively \"easy\" kills for the p38.", "id": "daveihf"}, {"comment": "Most of the Japanese pilots considered the f4u corsair to be our best plane ", "id": "dauza3x"}, {"comment": "that's no surprise.

In these small towns everyone knows each other, and have known each other forever. There are huge generations of people who have lived in the same city for 500+ years. It's just considered home - even though you can appreciate the beauty, it's all you've known so you take it for granted.\n\nI moved to Los Angeles last year and definitely miss places like these. Everywhere has its pro and con, and Italy definitely has a lot of pros, but I don't regret it. Northern italy is beautiful, especially the mountains and lakes, and it really is magical. \n\nWork is usually a family tradition, or a larger Italian company. A lot of my friends (19 - 20 years old) are working for either Alice or Telecom Italia, the italian phone/internet companies, or enel, the gas company. If they're not with the big companies, then usually they just follow in the same footsteps of whatever their parents were. Macellaio which is butcher in English, I think? Like meat seller? is a common one. Also bus driver, or wood workers. \n\nIf you have any questions on the area go ahead and ask!", "id": "cz4eu48"}, {"comment": "What do you miss the most?", "id": "cz56emg"}, {"comment": "The food and history/culture. Everything is so much older (and slower) than it is in LA. \n\nI'm 19 and love fast paced/ready to get on with my life/American Dream sort of situations, where you are your own creation and the amount of work you put in, while always striving for something better. In Italy, especially small towns, this feeling doesn't really exist. People are pretty ok with the status quo.\n\nAs a side note, I'd also say that that is why America is so great. Sure, a lot of people are ok with the status quo, but there are also a lot who are not. People constantly work to make things better, even in the face of adversity or personal struggle. That's not to say that they don't make mistakes, or act selfishly, but (as can be seen through history) at the end of the day America ends up creating better/bigger/faster/more efficient things, especially when it comes to pioneering new ideas. \n\nSo this isn't a *perfect* answer to what do I miss most, but it is the reason I left. There are great things about Italy, and it feels a lot more solid and established than America, and there are not so great things. I love both places, and go between the two fairly often, so maybe I haven't been gone long enough to point anything in specific out. I'm honestly never homesick - FaceTime, Skype, and Email make that much better, and I'm living a great life in LA. \n\nFood is much better there though. No doubt.

The nice thing is that you can get a villa for fairly cheap, as well, especially if it's only for a month. There are lots of beautiful places, and it depends on what you want to do. You can go up north, near Bolzano, where it is pretty Germanic and will remind you a lot more of mountains, lakes, and traditional \"Sound of Music\" like places (imagine Switzerland-like).\n\nThen there are the older, more established places like Verona, Padova, Vicenza, Venice, Milan, etc. (All north eastern Italy) that have their own story and amazing places, but are definitely more citylike. If you want the small town, nice Italy feel with the small house and chimney and sense of confraternity within the people, then go for a place up in the mountains, with a population of between 1000 and 15000. If you want traditional Italy, with the culture, art, history, and mainstream cuisine then go for one of the cities. \n\nBut no matter where you go, as long as you're not obnoxious Americans, you'll be fine.

I commonly focus on visiting sites that are out of the way, not commonly trafficked by tourists.  I drove to [Hattusa](https://www.flickr.com/photos/15763784@N06/albums/72157651808577831) the ancient capital of the Hittite Empire.  It's fairly remote in my opinion.  It was a walled city with walls that were longer than the city of Lucca, Italy.\n\nThere's a gate/guard house where people pay admission, but only when there's someone on duty.  Once inside, there are no park rangers or anything of the like.  There are no signs saying not to walk on this or that.  But this isn't uncommon for Europe or Turkey.\n\nThere's just so much history around that it's hard to preserve and protect it all.  Within a stone's throw of my house in Italy, we could visit what is locally known as the oldest church in Italy, dozens of towers and castles, aquaducts, etc.  None of it has admission charges.

Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .\n\nHistory is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of \u201chistory\u201d it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time\u2014and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.\n\nMy central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights\u2014or very early mornings\u2014when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .\n\nThere was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .\n\nAnd that, I think, was the handle\u2014that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\u2019t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting\u2014on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .\n\nSo now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark\u2014that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.\"\n\n-Hunter S.

It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era\u2014the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .\n\nHistory is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of \u201chistory\u201d it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time\u2014and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.\n\nMy central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights\u2014or very early mornings\u2014when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .\n\nThere was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .\n\nAnd that, I think, was the handle\u2014that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\u2019t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting\u2014on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .\n\nSo now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark\u2014that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.\"\n\n-Hunter S.

This is obviously not the story people choose to tell foreigners.\n\nApparently, most of this are lies. The house was built in the 1930s by a man named Peder Madsen Pedersen who intended to use it for recreational purposes such as a summerhouse, and making it available for local boy scouts.

I don't mind people moving in to somewhere they think is cool, as long as they accept that the \"corporatization\" of the neighborhood is a direct result of THEIR living there. I don't particularly like the term \"hipsters\" in a derogatory sense, they're really just people who like things...like everyone else.

Hydraulic systems on aircraft are usually triple redundancy, so any two systems can fail and the aircraft will still retain control. Aircraft are designed with separation requirements to keep hydraulic systems minimum distances from one another to prevent all of the systems from failing simultaneously. \n\nHowever, in certain areas of the aircraft, close proximity of redundant systems in unavoidable, such as the tail of the aircraft. The #1 and #3 hydraulic systems on the DC-10 were routed very close to each other in the tail of the aircraft. This was considered acceptable, since the #2 hydraulic system did not pass through the same space. However, the #2 hydraulic system WAS connected to the #2 (tail) engine. Which meant that a failure of the #2 engine would cause a failure of the hydraulic system. Engine failures are rare, and uncontained turbine failures are more rare, and somehow it was determined that a triple failure was suitably improbably and the design was certified.\n\nHowever, on this particular flight (UAL 232, for those interested), the #2 engine did explode, and one of the turbine rotors exited the engine housing, severing the #1 and #3 hydraulic systems at different points as it passed through the tail fins. The #2 system was destroyed as well, as its engine exploded. A total loss of hydraulic pressure lead to a total loss of flight control, and since this was considered to be exceedingly improbable, there was no recovery plan. The pilots managed to gain some control of the plane through use of the throttle levers, but the aircraft crashed and broke apart on landing.\n\nThe incident alone didn't have a huge effect on the popularity of the DC-10 for passenger ops, but it did have some pretty significant influences on the industry as a whole.", "id": "d5l8gyr"}, {"comment": "> but it did have some pretty significant influences on the industry as a whole.\n\nGo on...", "id": "d5ld2oc"}, {"comment": "Hydraulic fuses was a big one. Hydraulic fuses function exactly how you'd expect; if a hydraulic line is severed in one spot, the fuse shuts and keeps pressure in the rest of the system. In the case of UAL 232, hydraulic fuses would have allowed the pilots to use control surfaces on the wings to fly the aircraft, and ultimately would (presumably) have lead to a safer landing. \n\nAside from that, simulator and fly-by-wire software was changed to more accurately model engine throttle response. This actually was the specific reason why the aircraft crashed on landing; steering with engines requires that you wait for the engines to respond to input, which they do not do instantaneously or linearly. In the last few moments of the approach, the pilots increased the throttle to the engines, and one responded faster than the other, which caused the plane to bank and hit the runway wing-first. This crash spurred updates to engine throttle response in simulators and flight control computers.\n\nThere were also changes in the forging process for titanium engine rotors to reduce the likelihood of imperfections that caused the engine turbine failure in the first place.", "id": "d5le0mq"}, {"comment": "Awesome, thanks for taking the trouble to elaborate. :)", "id": "d5lef5d"}, {"comment": "By miracle they just so happened to have a DC-10 flight instructor on board as a passenger.

This brittle, defective block was taken out of production, but was then later on mistakenly put back in with the other blocks.  \n\nThat brittle metal ended up in the fan; the airline was found to be negligent, as the stress cracks of the fan blades were not spotted by the maintenance crew at any moment.", "id": "d5m1tz4"}, {"comment": "You are correct.

I'm just a soldier in the maker army. It does help to be in Taiwan if you like to explore the possiblities of technology. The locals here do have a great sense of re-using certain discarded items though that's not true across-the-board. It's quite possible to get many things repaired here that it would be too expensive to fix back in the States. I've had guys come to my house on a motorcycle and solder relays onto damaged circuit boards for like six bucks and they're happy to show you how they do it. So in some ways yeah it's more encouraged.   \n\nOn the other hand, thrift stores aren't nearly as common although you can find them if you look. I think that's partly because thrift shops rely a lot on clothing sales and in a highly humid environment storing old clothes is not going to work in a low-cost manner the way it does in drier climate. Fabrics will literally rot if left in damp places for too long and it's damp everywhere unless you're actively doing something to keep it under control. What you  can find in abundance though is second-hand appliance and computer shops as well as marine supplies and those things are harder to find back Stateside.\n\nSo I can just go to a shop that always has second-hand dehumidifiers and pick one up for sixty bucks or I can put the word out and get them for free when people toss them out because they're \"broken\" because the fix is nearly always the same and quite simple to be honest. Also I can get full-sized refrigerator compressors for about forty bucks from a wide selection and then go next door and get custom refrigeration parts or go to another part of town and get and sort of electronics I need at really nice prices including heavy but nice stuff like big transformers that are difficult to send through the mail. So yeah it helps to be in Taiwan but the really crucial element I would say is the internet.

I too got my portables used, so they didn't cost much. But my electricity was still fairly costly, even at low US rates. I wanted something that would consume less power and require less (i.e. no) maintenence from me. The unit I ended up with also has a push/pull configuration, so I put the intake on a wall in a hallway and ducted the output to an adjacent large room. The drain is pumped (with a float switch) to a floor drain and the whole system is controled by a humidistat, so it keeps the living space at a steady 45% humidity year 'round, working a lot in the damp summers and only sporadically in the drier winters. It was a great improvement over the portables, but if you aren't paying $$ for power and have some technical skills to play with I'm sure you can do as good without dropping $1,000+ for a new unit.

It was a resort right on the shore with great big swimming pools and water slides but it never was finished so it only ever existed as ruins.

I'm one of the few foreigners who has seen the original plans because I live till this day in a community that was part of the development up in the hills a bit. Once upon a time when I first came out here there was a full 3D model that showed the entire proposed development in a really cool modernist house that was in a state of ruin.

She managed to flee to a neighbor\u2019s home and the police were called. But by the time they arrived at the home, they also discovered the body of Dr. Perelson, who had killed himself by drinking a glass of acid and curled up next to his dead wife. When the Two other children woke up during the attack to find their mother dead he ushered them back to bed telling them it was only a nightmare. They were promptly removed by authorities. The three survivors have whereabouts that are unknown.\n\nToday, the home sits abandoned and slowly decaying, hardly anything moved since the night of the murder. Christmas gifts still sit unopened. An alarm system has been added to keep out intruders, because as you can see in the image of the front door, there have been attempts to break in. The only photos of the house are images looking through windows.\n\nThe current owner claims to use the property for storage, though lives out of state.\n\n~~source with more pics: http://mylabucketlist.com/2012/09/24/the-paranormal-house-in-los-feliz-bucket-list/~~\n\nrehosted to imgur cause orignal source has expired: http://imgur.com/a/KklDe#lUkAmJX", "id": "cxxdmzw"}, {"comment": "I am glad you posted this.

CS takes a reasonable while to burn through bits of skin, and most of it (say you swig a big cup) is going to hit your stomach. That just leaves the thinnish coating on your actual throat, and maybe mouth I suppose, to be burned. Thin coatings can only penetrate so far before they've chemically expended themselves.\n\nIf you mixed draino with water, I doubt you'd get it strong enough to be dangerous, but if you put it in a pan and carefully applied a flame to melt it you'd essentially have a CS solution of 100%, that night do some damage. Some serious, get to the emergency room damage.

Even most outright racists try to cover it up by making it about a 'country' not the 'ethnicity'. \n\nE.g., in one area that my sister was in, they were really outspoken about Japanese superiority. They were very proud about Japanese accomplishments (understandable!) and they would regularly talk about how they did things better than other countries (also kind of understandable!). The funny thing was, not all the examples used were invented/started in Japan. However, they would regularly take credit for foreign ideas, and sometimes even use it as proof for foreigner inferiority. There was an idea that the Japanese did things better, so if something was being done, it was because it was a Japanese idea or improved by the Japanese.

They've come around the town a few times decrying foreign influence on Japanese culture.  Most of it is hilariously silly, like saying that foreigners should leave Japanese schools and Japan has always had the best schools etc.  And that the Japanese have always had military superiority over neighboring countries and so the JSDF should be fully militarized/armed again.  The group is small but vocal.  No-one I work with or interact with regularly has ever expressed those sentiments to me.  (Most people complain about the noise and the general idiocy of the situation, just like around elections, and when the weather is nice and the bosuzoku are revving up and down the local roads and terrorizing children and livestock.)\n\nBut the idea that foreigners can completely integrate is still not true.  Whenever I tell my coworkers I'm heading out with a group of friends, they'll always assume the group is entirely foreigners.  Both relationships I've had here shocked people I talked to when they turned out to be Japanese instead of foreigners as well.

I found it to be a really nice windy story of a few family's intertwining lives from the 60's to the 90's. It's the one that I think this series of urbex photos elicits the most feelings for. Especially as much of the stories are spent at summer homes in resort-y areas outside of Tokyo. And that book has a few real pictures in it of the types of places it describes. Man, I loved that book. I had no idea what it was really supposed to be about and I had no idea where it was going but I couldn't put it down. And it was really long, over 800 pages. I tend to prefer stories without clearly defined antagonists though. \n\nHaruki Murakami is kind of the current king of Japanese Literature. \"1Q84\" is an otherworldly tale, masterfully written. Long but such a good read. I'm reading \"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\" currently for my bookclub. I'm not too far in but it's described as a \"mystery\" as a man searches for his wife? I hear good things about it. He's not a mystery writer and 1Q84 wasn't a mystery book itself so much as it was mysterious. Actually mysterious is the perfect word to describe Murakami's tone and worlds he builds, everything feels otherworldly and mysterious. Even his novel \"Norwegian Wood\" had this very otherworldly, ethereal feeling to it. I feel the same way about abandoned places so I guess that's also another reason why this post so strongly elicited memories of those novels... Huh. Thanks for making me look into that more haha.\n\nIf you're into cats, there's a cute little shortish story called \"The Guest Cat\" by Takashi Hiraide. \n\n(I've honestly only just recently started getting into Japanese literature so if anybody else has any suggestions, I'm very interested in branching out into more obscure writers!!)\n\n\n", "id": "daet87u"}, {"comment": "So true, it's Damn near impossible to get in unless you're going as a teacher", "id": "dae18st"}, {"comment": "It's also legal and acceptable to discriminate against foreigners there.", "id": "dae6c6x"}, {"comment": "Oh, the bugs in those mats.", "id": "dae4lzb"}, {"comment": "Is there any chance that will change?

This means that not only are there a lot of economically non-viable business, but also that there aren't enough people to work those jobs anyways.\n> That's not a direct response, I just realized, but if you consider those, you can imagine how some of these places \"died,\" with all this stuff being left behind.\n\nThe reason why these properties are still there is more than just the aging factor. The biggest problem is Japanese property laws. Unfortunately due to taxation purposes, it costs a lot more for demolishing these properties rather than paying taxes to the municipal governments. Due to this, the Japanese diet is attempting to change this, to allow more of these abandoned properties to be demolished without causing such a burden on the owners of the property.

There are plenty of other forces to consider, but let's start with the person. For that one, I'm going with the universe where gravity is applied downwards, so the same universe where someone walking on a flat earth floor isn't putting any strain on the walls.

No, but you're the one who asserted the chances, not me, so there's the first piece of uncertainty.\n\nOR,we could go with this wild universe where weather and wind and earthquakes happen. Those are forces too, and much more destructive than a single person being inside on a floor that may or may not be connected to the outer structure. \n\nOR WE COULD EVEN go with a universe that has animals ( I know crazy but hear me out). Animals often use structures for shelter, and if there is no other visible shelter you can bet it's been used as that before.\n\nYou were saying that there's a **guaranteed better chance than ever** that this structure will collapse if a person goes inside of it. That might be the case, but probably not. There is a better chance of it collapsing in an earthquake, or windstorm, or when occupied by a flock of migrant birds than if entered by one extremely careful person in the right conditions.

Ah yes, doing my bit for tourism.\n\nThere's kind of three coasts. The east is as you describe, all rugged and Atlantic. The west is nice, but very pricey, but south of town is the south-west coast, which is also nice, but much more reasonable. Given you say you're a grad student, I'm gonna make an assumption, and recommend you stay on the south coast.\n\nIf you think you're gonna save money buy staying in a villa, I'd warn you that the difference is not as big as elsewhere, as supermarkets are expensive. If you planning on a villa just to chill out, then cool. go right ahead. Pretty much everywhere you're likely to rent is safe; PM me or check /r/barbados when you're ready to book, and we can help. Villas right on the beach are obviously gonna be more expensive, so if you're considering a hotel, you could check out oceans two or silver point hotel. oceans two is in st lawrence gap, with loads of bars and restaurants, and is quite bustling, though the hotel tucked away at one end. silver point is much more chilled. It's right at the southern tip, so a bit more atlantic and dramatic, but there's a lovely relaxing breeze, and if you want to chill out, it's great.\n\nIf you're a bit older and don't want to be out partying, Grandma's built a lovely little apartment right on the beach just out of town, but it's very low-key, as she just wants a peaceful life. If you were to get a villa or apartment anywhere other than on the main south cost road, I'd recommend getting a car. Sure, there are buses, but they're hot as shite, and a pain.  \n\nA car will allow you to get out exploring, which is what I recommend you do. Book a catamaran cruise and island safari, say, and leave he rest of the days free for exploring and getting lost. The island's remarkably varied for somewhere so small, and if you don't go looking too hard, you'll find 'island time' here.  \n\nI don't know where your mum o the 'major military presence' from, but that's hilarious, and really cute. We have a tiny defence force, with a cessna, and a couple of boats. Policing tends to be closer to the british model than the american one, so you're fine. But no, you can't wear camo, it's true.

When I was 7 years old, I was sent by myself a day early for some reason. I was a fairly adventurous kid, but as soon as I made it to the terminal, I recall being extremely nervous. My parents were there to see me off, so to make me feel better, they introduced me to the flight attendants and showered me with hugs and snacks, including my favorite candy--skittles. I remember waving bye to my parents and a flight attendant brought me on the plane before everyone else and sat me down in my seat.\n\nA few minutes later, I see the pilot come onboard and head straight for me. He asks if I want to come check out the cockpit. I'm already crazy interested in planes, so I jump up and follow him. Now, it's important to note that this is pre-9/11, because I highly doubt this would ever happen in modern-day commercial flight. Anyways, the pilot and his co-pilot show me all the bells and whistles in the cockpit, tell me about the plane, and give me those gold wings they used to give out. They even let me sit in the pilot's seat. It was awesome.\n\nHere's why I really remember this story--While I'm sitting in the cockpit all wide-eyed, looking at the gadgets, the pilot sees my bag of skittles. He asks me for some, and obviously I give him a handful because he's basically the coolest person in the world to me. After they bring me back to my seat, people start boarding. A few minutes later, I see the pilot heading back towards me again. This goddamn hero has an enormous bag of skittles in his hand. After I had given him a handful of mine, he had literally walked back out into the terminal and purchased a king-sized bag for me. And the crew treated me like a king the rest of the flight--checking on me periodically and walking me out to meet my grandparents at Logan Airport. It completely removed my nervousness for flying alone as a little kid.\n\nFrom that moment on, my interest in planes and flying grew significantly. I loved reading books about different planes and going to air shows. I even considered a career as a pilot. While life had other plans for me, this Northwest Airlines flight crew obviously had a very positive impact on a young kid.

An accident report on AERO News Network states -- \"A Russian Mi-17 turbine helicopter, enroute to Base Camp with porters on their way to the 50th anniversary celebrations of Mount Everest's (29,002 feet) first climb, crashed Wednesday with at least three fatalities and seven reported injuries/survivors. The Mi-17 was based in Kathmandu and chartered from Simrik Air. On board were five porters, a mountain guide and four crew members. On its return the helo was to have picked up climbers that had just returned from having climbed the mountain in celebration of the May 29, 1953 ascent by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa. The accident, seen on video, shows the Mi-17 on approach to landing and veering off to the left, suddenly, in a descent to disappear beyond a ridge line. The sight of parts flying about, shortly thereafter, occurs (apparently) at impact. Two of the dead were reported as mountain porter Phudorji Sherpa and cabin attendant Anup Dewan. An airport official claimed that, \"The chopper left Kathmandu in the morning but because of bad weather it stopped at Lukla airport (in NE Nepal) for some time. It later proceeded to the Base Camp and crashed nearby.\" Among the injured was a German woman, who had the misfortune to be walking near Base Camp when the helicopter crashed. Listed in serious condition are Cris Lising (of Germany), the helo's Nepalese captain, Rameswor Thapa, and flight engineer Kyraliyev Kachkynpay of Kazakhstan. Others reported injured include porters Chumbi Sherpa, Dil Bahadur Oli, Dawa Tshering and Phu Dorji Sherpa. Two persons were fortunate to merge from the crash unhurt.\"\n\n> [*^Viewral ^Video ^Channel*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZZJluq3oO_6pDNxsDSTxNQ) ^in ^Science ^& ^Technology\n\n>*^9,756 ^views ^since ^Mar ^2014*\n\n[^bot ^info](http://www.reddit.com/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index)", "id": "d2pyyre"}, {"comment": "Why is that one guy screaming \"Don't leave us!\" - and then after crashing \"Don't you do that!\" - seems a very, VERY odd reaction for ANYONE making it to base camp at Everest.", "id": "d2qbd11"}, {"comment": "I think its another language, but they may be saying OH MY GOSH", "id": "d2qucp2"}, {"comment": "Sounds like English to be, Australian or New Zealand accent?

There were a few busted parts but nothing too scary. We went to watch the sunrise, so we left around 3-4 A.M. So it was pretty dewy which made it a bit sketchier. But yeah we had to hop a barbed wire fence and then sneak through a bamboo forest around the security that's stationed in front. Honestly it just added to the cool factor. You stand on the very top and get a beautiful view of Honolulu and Waikiki, then if you turn around you get a full view of Pearl Harbor. Probably the coolest place I've ever been to, I'll be trying to go back in May. \n\nEdit: also just as a PSA its not an easy hike. Nothing makes you realize you need to do more cardio than a 4,000 rung ladder. \n\nEdit 2: Apparently I suck with words, thank you for pointing out my idiocy kindly. \n\nEdit 3: the photo doesn't show much, you can continue climbing to the very top.

Calling it a cylinder, which it's not, it would have 7,200 square meters of surface area. Is it double hulled? Beats me, but assume it's not. The heat transfer coefficient of steel is 25 W/m^2*K. If the sea water were 4 deg C and the inside 25 deg C that's a delta of 21 K, so figure heat lost to the sea as being 3.8 MW.\n\n>It's got two 45 MW turbines. According to Wiki, marine steam cycle turbines have yet to break the 50% barrier in efficiency, so half of the 90 MW is wasted, most likely as heat. Some noise of course, but the Ohio class is pretty quiet.\n\n>So, heat loss through the shell to the sea by conduction, 3.8 MW. Heat wasted by the turbines, 45 MW. I'm calling it exothermic. I made a lot of assumptions, and my math is sloppy but maybe my mistakes will cancel out.\n\n>There's going to be some big ass heat exchangers on board to get rid of the extra heat.\n\nBut I don't know as that'd be enough- even when running at full power- to generate enough heat.
