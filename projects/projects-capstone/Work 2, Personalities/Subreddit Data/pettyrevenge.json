My boyfriend is an English cheese snob and had me try some Camembert and some blue cheese or another but I didn't go for them, and I want to impress him by enjoying more than like one and a half kinds of cheese. Also any suggestions for ways to prove that America also makes great cheese because I think my lack of cheese knowledge is giving him a bad impression of the country. ", "id": "d7iackz"}, {"comment": "For a good English cheese I recommend Aged English Cheddar. It's a sharp, nutty cheddar and is good for snacking and melting. Try it with Fuji or Honeycrisp apples to really bring out the flavor.  \n\nFor Brie, the Chatelain Brie is my favorite. It's a gooey, spreadable Brie with a little bit of funkyness and minerality. It's best paired with a good jam (I love strawberry jam), and Champagne or Prosecco (any other sweeter sparking or sweet wine will work too). \n\nFor something different, Florette is a bloomy goat cheese that's one of my favorite soft goat cheeses. It's buttery and smooth, without an overpowering \"goaty\" flavor when it's ripe. Try it with a little jam on a cracker.  \n\nThe Sartori family (my favorite company right here in the US) makes a cheese called Bellavitano. My favorite is the Raspberry Bellavitano and the Merlot Bellavitano. The Merlot Bellavitano is great with apples and other fruits, and also salami and pickle. For wine I usually go with a red, and an easy wine would be Merlot, but I've also had a good Oregon Pinot Noir.  \n\nFor Gouda, I usually recommend the Boerenkaas Gouda because the flavors are fairly balanced. It's a little sweet and a little salty but not too strong. It pairs well with jams and fruit, and also salami and pickle. You could go with pretty much any red or white wine with this one, it works so well.  \n\nEstate Gouda is also a great paring cheese. The Gouda is a little on the sweeter side, so I usually pair it with apples, pears, or jam.  \n\nFor American cheese companies I really like Beecher's, Rogue Creamery, River's Edge, and Jasper Hill. All of Beecher's products are awesome! Try their Flagship Cheddar and Marco Polo. Rogue Creamery makes a bunch of really good Blue cheese, my favorite is their Oregonzola. River's Edge makes a cute little cheese called Up in Smoke. It's a maple leaf wrapped goat cheese with a nice smoky flavor and a little astringency from the maple leaf. Jasper Hill makes a cheese called Harbison that's popping up everywhere. It's a funky spruce bark wrapped cheese that's gooey, and very flavorful. It's great with a nice baguette.", "id": "d7ievz8"}], [{"comment": "Every Thanksgiving my husband's uncle waxes poetic about a Raclette fondue he had when he was in Switzerland.

", "id": "d6nipy5"}, {"comment": "I absolutely understand the feelings you had, it brought back to memory an incident I had but unlike you I don't feel any regret. Although the act of revenge I committed wasn't to the level you took your event. \n     When I was about 25 (almost 15 years ago, man where does the time go) I moved in  with a guy that I had known a couple years from the local bar and music scene. At the time I was following Jam bands around and going to a lot of music festivals whenever I had the chance. After about 8-9 months of living together things weren't working out so well and he told me I needed to find another place to live. Ok, no problem. I told him I'd be out by the end of the month and left for a week to go to some shows but came back 4 days before of the month to handle the situation. Except while I was gone he had changed the locks and pawned most of my stuff. I didn't have my name on the lease (I know pretty stupid but I was young and trusting) so I had no way of getting what was left back. We still went to the same couple bars/music venues and this was causing some problems bc there were a couple of instances that our two groups of friends nearly came to blows. The owner of one of the venues who was a mutual friend to us both stepped in and tried to negotiate a truce bc he was going to have to ban everyone if things didn't calm down. He basically held my personal things (some gifts from family and things that had sentimental value) for ransom. I ended up having to pay him several hundred dollars to get the  items which he had actually ruined. He had a friend stay at the apartment while I got my things so he wouldn't have to face me and all was over. Except when he got home that night he was robbed at gun point which I honestly had absolutely nothing to do with. The next time I saw him he pulled me aside and I thought he intended to apologize, instead he made all these ridiculous threats. The funniest being some rant ending in \"you don't know who you've fucked with. In the game of life you play checkers and I play chess, and I'm a grand master at chess!\" Pretty hilarious if you ask me. I end up getting him banned from all the local hang outs we frequented. I tell our mutual friends the details of his bullshit and pretty much everyone turns their backs on him. My cousin worked where he worked and told management about how he smoked weed on his breaks (which he did) and it being a manufacturing plant all the did was wait for him to take a break and bust him in the act. After all this he left town.\n     Fast forward a few years and I bump into him and start to do a little investigating. He's moved back in the area and bought a house with his retired father cosigning his loan in a smaller suburb of our city. So the need to further my revenge kicks back in full force. Because his new house was close to an elementary school I printed out copies of a flier with his picture informing people that he is a pedophile (complete BS) and post them all over his surrounding neighborhoods. I also made sure that one found its way to the place he was working. The small knit community being what it is they kicked into action and did my job for me. He was fired and unable to find another job in the area.  He was openly shunned and threatened by all his neighbors and couldn't meet anyone without the story following him. It took about a year but he ended up foreclosing on the home and moving back in with his family. The story even followed him to the city we lived in and I helped to spread the rumor that his leaving for a few years was actually him going to jail for hooking up with a 15 year old he met over the Internet. He was known for starting several message boards for some of the bands we followed so this seemed believable to just about everyone. \n     It was surprising to me that it really didn't take that much effort to pull the right strings and watch his world come down around him. After a while it just didn't interest me anymore but if I saw him today if I could find a way to make his day horrible I would. It doesn't consume me but I have no forgiveness in me for him and don't think I ever will. So all in all I can relate to how you felt about your situation but I still have no regrets. He threatened my life so I tried to destroy his. I don't think he ever realized what was happening or who did it and other than my cousin no one knows it was me.

Cold, but that's Toronto, right?\n\nAnyway, one year the guys got bored, and made snowmen out of the snow near the docks. Put them all over the place and as those kinds of guys are wont to do, they didn't exactly make them suitable for children to view. Unnamed super-important dude comes in and tells them to take all of the snowmen down, and they do.\n\nLo and behold, the next few days see snowmen popping up again. Supervisor tells them again not to do it.\n\nOne shitty winter afternoon, they decide to build a snowman in a place where they know it can't be knocked down, and they make a point of telling the supervisor that they're building a snowman and it would not be a good idea to knock it down. Supervisor tells his unnamed super-important dude.\n\nThis guy happens to be one of those people that, even as a dumbass 'edgy' teenager who told bad jokes in too loud a voice and pretended to be offensive, I knew I didn't like. Every possible union-mafia-lawyer stereotype under the sun, this guy was it.\n\nIt's close of the last shift. The guy comes roaring in on his new Land Rover, clearly an expensive vehicle. Yells at a bunch of guys to \"Take that fucking snow man down!\" From what I understand from the workers, dude's an asshole anyway.

Don't fuck with harmless fun. Because otherwise, they might build a snowman around a concrete bollard.\n\nThe almighty bang and crash of a tricked out Land Rover running headfirst into a concrete bollard is a sweet spectacle, matched only by the guy's reaction once the airbag had settled.

Back when I worked in a fast food joint we had them.\n\nThey would come in, order something the standard way, and then after they got their food, they would insist that they ordered a premium item in order to get that premium item for free.\n\nMost memorable one, I was working the fry station, which happened to be right behind the register. A guy comes up and orders a junior meal, which is basically a kid-sized burger meal, but with a larger drink and full veggie load. \n\nHe asked very adamantly to verify that the junior meal came with a small order of fries, which of course, it did. Sensing that this guy was going to be one of *those* customers, I decided to drop some fries so I could give him the freshest possible ones. Boom, just as my timer goes off, his burger comes sliding down the side. I serve up his small fry order and place it in the bag, put on my best fake customer service smile and handed him his food. \n\nHe opens the bag and looks in. He then gives me the angriest look I had ever seen on a fast food customer's face. \"Where **THE HELL** are my **ONION RINGS** you **MORON**!\"\n\nNow, there was no such thing as a small order of onion rings. If you wanted a junior meal with onion rings, you had to upsize the meal to a medium or large side. I immediately knew what this guy was up to, and I called him out on it: \"I'm sorry sir, but I clearly heard you asking about small fries. Unfortunately, onion rings require an upgrade. If you'd like some onion rings, the cashier would be glad to ring you up an order.\"\n\nOf course he flipped his shit and demanded to see a manager. The cashier had seen it coming, though, and had already gone to get her. The manager came back, looked at the receipt, and told the guy that he would have to pay for onion rings. He grumbles and walks away with exactly what he ordered.", "id": "d9jxr4c"}, {"comment": "People would always conveniently forget to order their side of sour cream then get snooty when I told them it would be $0.42 please.

This is my quick summary:\n\nThere is a tiny difference in caffeine levels, not because of caffeine burning off, because a lighter roast is more dense. if you measure out your coffee(tablespoons), the light roast will have more, because more of the smaller, denser beans will fit into the measuring cups. however, if you weigh your coffee(the typically accepted form of measuring coffee, used at your local gourmet coffee joint) the dark roast will have more caffeine, because the less dense beans will be more numerous in the scale.\n\nIf you have any other questions about coffee you can ask, I will probably have the answer, as a coffee snob ", "id": "dad6ef2"}], [{"comment": "This is the best one ive read in a while.

If he considers this revenge (and we don't know that, since we're getting it secondhand from OP, who isn't the father) then he isn't the great father the post says he is. Not every kid wants to spend every visitation period with the parent in question.\n\nBut taking the other kids? Nothing wrong with that. They aren't an unbreakable set and you're right that the younger kids have a great memory with Dad.\n\nBut if Oldest is upset, unless he does something (even as simple as mentioning she was missed and telling her next time so she doesn't miss out again) she may resent him for a very long time. Depending on how hard she holds a grudge, and how common a trip like this is (once in a lifetime like Disney, once in a year or two like six flags, maybe every couple months like Chuck E Cheese) it could drive her further away.\n\nI was a kid of divorce and knew a lot of them. My dad did similar stuff a few times, and it didn't damage our relationship. (Although it might have if I found out one of his friends gloated about it online, and depending on her age she may be reddit-ready.) \n\nHe would take my stepbrother somewhere awesome when I couldn't go. (sick, school obligation, had to stay at my mom's because she had to be at the hospital, and yeah I had a few times that I was just tired and didn't want to drag myself over to his house and endure he and his wife fighting.) Or I would be there, but he didn't even ask me to come. Like I was at his house but he wouldn't ask me if I wanted to go hiking or fishing. and it hurt. But it was made better by him honestly telling me he was sorry I was left out and admitting he hadn't thought I would want to go. (And I won't lie, my stepbrother telling me his missed me there and telling me about it was great too. I have an awesome little brother.)\n\nSo with Dad it was never revenge. My friend Anne though, her dad would pick any weekend she wasn't there to do ALL the fun shit with her brothers. Her stay home excuse was usually because she had to study, she was in a gifted program and the weekends she went to her Dad's they would just hang around his house, maybe get fast food. The weekends she had to study would be rodeo and camping trips and theme parks.

The whole point is that it's ridiculous to expect things to radically change because of a small technicality.\n\n\nI try to be straight and fair with these guys and get them what they need, because honestly being a truck driver stinks (hours, never home, bad health, etc), but what I don't like is when people try to take advantage of me. Most people are just fine (Mexican drivers are the best people ever) but every once in a while you get these pricks that try to bend you over a barrel if everything doesn't go 100% smoothly.\"\n\n\nSo according to you, the driver should have taken the load to the original drop off point and held the load hostage until we met his ridiculous terms? Nothing would ever get done if this is the way people thought. I don't deduct money from a carrier when they blow a pick/del, I don't fine them if they have a break down and have to come off a load, and I fight to get them good rates on detention if they deserve it. But if something alters even slightly on my side, your answer is to stop everything until you get your way.

And you're being mighty optimistic with what kinds of spreads we make these days. \n\n\nI'm going to say it again: If I tried to get this guy $4,000, he wouldn't have gotten the load. Period.

As you just said, ice is also expensive since you need to extract a lot of energy from liquid water to produce solid water.  [Sam's Club sells 5 gallons of Coca-Cola syrup for $82](http://www.samsclub.com/sams/coca-cola-5-gallon-bag-in-box-fountain-syrup/prod7680002.ip?sprodId=prod7680002&selectedTab=allProducts&_requestid=41888), and [fountain soda is 85% water](http://markproffitt.com/2011/02/15/secret-to-why-mcdonalds-coke-tastes-best/), which suggests that in order to make the drink they use 15% syrup.  The cost of making ice is about [$0.25 per 10 lbs](http://bagofice.com/faqs-about-ice-vending-machines/), and 10 lbs of ice has a volume of 1.32 gallons or 170oz (note the density of ice is not the same as liquid water).\n\nNow, McDonald's offers a 32oz fountain drink for $1.49.  If it was pure soda, then it would be 27.2oz water and 4.8oz syrup.  Now syrup costs $0.13 per oz which would be $0.62 for 4.8oz.  Hence the contents of the large soda are maybe $0.63 plus cup, lid, and straw.  \n\nIf we fill it with ice, and that ice takes up half the volume then it's immediately clear that the contents are only $0.31, right?  Well, no, ice isn't free because ice isn't pumped into businesses by an underground pipe like water is.  Instead, ice costs $0.25 per 170oz so this adds $0.03 while saving them $0.31 in syrup.\n\nDid anyone really think that large companies didn't do a cost-benefit analysis of ice vs syrup?  The numbers change a bit because I'm using the cost of generating ice, and the cost of Coca-Cola's syrup sold without any bulk discount, but I'm still finding syrup is about 10x more expensive than ice.  In reality, McDonald's gets stainless containers much larger than 5 gallons and they buy it so frequently that they've surely got a discounted rate.  If it's a 25% discount then we would know 5 gallons costs $62 and then the cost of syrup isn't $0.62 but $0.46.  At that point, the large drink is making a profit of about $1 even served without ice, and about $1.20 with ice.  Not bad on a $1.49 sale.\n\nBut... this isn't why they do that.  They do that because the soda coming out of a soda fountain is warmer than most people are used to.

This states that his lease holds everyone responsible for a shared portion of the utilities.  This is pretty standard in a lease, and OP makes it clear that he is responsible, and has agreed to pay a portion of the utilities.\n\nSo, roommate has signed up (for example) with electric, gas, trash, and water, right?  Then he passes a portion of those costs to each tenant in the rental unit.  Each tenant has agreed to pay a portion of those costs.  From what OP says, it's clear the amount is set each month.\n\nLet's say $500/mo for rent, and then it's $80/mo per person for the utilities.  That makes sense, right?  Sure.  And the roommates all signed the lease stating that they agreed to help pay those utilities, because of course they use them so that makes sense.\n\nHowever, the roommate (and de-facto landlord) is now asking him for *$30 more* money each month due to the roommate adding cable TV to this \"shared utility\" agreement.  This additional charge is being billed to OP as part of the previously agreed upon and signed, legally binding, lease arrangement.  This change is *illegal* in almost all states *unless it is agreed upon in writing prior to being changed*.\n\nSo, for the roommate to legally pass the additional $30/mo charge onto OP, and call it part of the lease, the roommate (and de-facto landlord) must do that in writing **AND** each tenant must agree **AND** sign a document stating their agreement.\n\nThis is usually dictated by state law.

Messages sent. We saw the proof. The parents saw it. It is not the plaintiff's job to prove the defendant was framed.

Can the defense prove *beyond reasonable doubt* that Steve was incapable of the act? \n\n>  I'd make sure...that the person I'm accusing of something is the actual person who did it\n\nIn this situation the parents become the arbiters (the prosecution). This becomes a negotiation of the prosecution, the defense, and the jury.\n\nThe plaintiff only files charges. From there out things are out of his/her hands.\n\nIn this specific case the margin of error is fairly insubstantial due to the combination of the petty nature of the act and the vested interest of the parties he contacted. \n\nParents of a kid trolling on his phone/computer are unlikely to incarcerate their kid. If he is innocent and can prove it (his phone is stolen or clearly third-party/suspicious activity occurs) then no big deal.\n\nThe family is thus alerted to a security/property breach.\n\nIn a more serious case OP would be best left to put this into legal hands (say that the person in question sent him photographs of OP sleeping in his bed taken from an angle within the house) but again it would not be OP's function to prove that 14 was framed. \n\nI like you though because of that.

If a third party set him up it is in the hands of the defense to cast that shadow of doubt.\n\nThat, and kids and *dumb*. I speak from experience as a subject matter expert: I was a dumb kid.\n\nI cannot count the number of times I got into hot water because I did not think something through as a kid.

Not only that, but the Police Chief had a one-on-one with me.\n\nAll because I said a single sentence. Like 14 (probably - benefit of the doubt) I had no intention of carrying it out.

One day I was in his room wearing a lead apron as we were doing a case that required intra-op X-rays. Unbeknownst to me, I had grabbed the personalized lead aprons of one of his colleagues, Dr. Smith who was not working that day. As the case is going, Greg looks up and sees I am wearing Smith's lead apron. He stops what he is doing and asks me, \"are you Dr. Smith?\" I replied that no I wasn't. He then proceeds to flip out and ask \"why the hell are you wearing his lead then?!? Take it off now and get another different lead apron at the rack!\" (The rack had literally 10-15 other lead aprons that weren't personalized). \n\nMe being a lowly resident at the time, I bit my tongue and changed lead aprons in front of all the other coworkers in the room because this prick was making such a big deal out of it. A belittling experience and it made me hate the shit out of this guy. The revenge: One day soon after that experience, I grabbed some lunch at work and went into the lounge to eat. The lounge was empty, so I started to eat my hospital cafeteria sandwich in peace. While eating, I noticed a white coat that physicians wear hanging on a rack. I looked at the name and saw it belonged to that prick orthopedic surgeon Greg. After checking to make sure nobody else was in the lounge, I got up and grabbed the sopping wet pickle spear that came with my lunch and placed it in Dr. Greg's white coat pocket and left. \n\nWhy?

Backround: I am an anesthesiologist, and back when I was doing my residency training there was this loud-mouth prick orthopedic surgeon at the hospital I worked. Let's call him Greg. \n\nHe was always bitching about anesthesia delaying him, was never happy, and talked in this loud abrasive tone. Basically treated everyone like peons around him. One day I was in his room wearing a lead apron as we were doing a case that required intra-op X-rays. Unbeknownst to me, I had grabbed the personalized lead aprons of one of his colleagues, Dr. Smith who was not working that day. As the case is going, Greg looks up and sees I am wearing Smith's lead apron. He stops what he is doing and asks me, \"are you Dr. Smith?\" I replied that no I wasn't. He then proceeds to flip out and ask \"why the hell are you wearing his lead then?!? Take it off now and get another different lead apron at the rack!\" (The rack had literally 10-15 other lead aprons that weren't personalized). \n\nMe being a lowly resident at the time, I bit my tongue and changed lead aprons in front of all the other coworkers in the room because this prick was making such a big deal out of it. A belittling experience and it made me hate the shit out of this guy. The revenge: One day soon after that experience, I grabbed some lunch at work and went into the lounge to eat. The lounge was empty, so I started to eat my hospital cafeteria sandwich in peace. While eating, I noticed a white coat that physicians wear hanging on a rack. I looked at the name and saw it belonged to that prick orthopedic surgeon Greg. After checking to make sure nobody else was in the lounge, I got up and grabbed the sopping wet pickle spear that came with my lunch and placed it in Dr. Greg's white coat pocket and left. \n\nWhy?

Saddens me, but doesn't surprise me. My husband wonders why it takes me so long to park at night when we go out. \n\nWell, I'm making sure that I'm under a working parking lot light; that there isn't a dumpster, sign, large bush or cart corral that someone could hide behind to intercept me walking back to my car; and that I'm parking near the entrance/exit that will be open late (Wal-mart closes one set of doors at 10 - who wants to traverse the deserted parking lot?) \n\nIt's scary being a woman (and yes, sometimes it's scary being a man).\n\n One of the scariest incidents I endured was when I was using one of those blue **Super Shuttle** vans from the airport to my uncle's house, way out in the boonies. It was at night, I was the last to be dropped off, it was just the driver and me in the middle of nowhere. \n\nHe wanted me to come sit up front so I could give him directions - which sounded logical at first. Then he started asking me personal questions - getting more and more explicit. More and more detailed - with this creepy little grin whilst he was rubbing his thigh.\n\n And this is why I don't think the **Always Sunny in Philadelphia** 'Implication' conversation is funny. \n\nHe never SAID it; he never MENTIONED it - but we both knew that he could have pulled over, raped me and left me for dead. He had all the time and all the privacy - he would see headlights coming from miles away.\n\nHe knew that I had to play along and answer his questions because I DIDN'T KNOW if he would take it that far or not - I had to hope that pacifying him with deeply private information was enough. \n\nThat was the only card I really had to play - if I pissed him off from the beginning, there would be no reason for him to refrain from hurting me. My deeply intimate memories were the stock-in-trade for his forbearance. \n\nI was completely under his power. It was up to him if I made it to my uncle's (or anywhere else) alive - or at all. And he got off on that. \n\nJust miles and miles and miles of unlit country roads - nothing but cows. And he got 'lost' - so that added at least two hours to the trip. \n\nI was shaking, and terrified and shrinking away from him - pressed up so far against my door I could have fallen out if it unlocked. I would have been relieved to fall out at 30mph. Yet I knew that if I challenged him, it would make him angry for not playing the game. \n\nFinally got to my uncle's house. He dropped me off and my uncle even tipped him. I was ghost white and completely silent - which they attributed to jet lag and the late hour. \n\nMy aunt, uncle & I went straight to bed. I took some sleeping pills and slept - obviously not well. But I never said anything to them. It would have distressed them, and what could they do?\n\nI was still young enough to be naive and optimistic. After I was out of the situation, I was indignant at the outrage to which I'd been subjected. I wanted him to be kept away from other women. \n\nI wrote a letter of complaint to the company about his behavior. I received a letter back stating they'd looked into it, and the driver (amazingly! Wow! really?) vehemently denied anything like that happening. No shit! \n\nAnd then! They had the gall to send me COUPONS! COUPONS! As if I ever had any intention of using their service again. \n\nIf cellphones had been around at that time, with all the recording and uploading-to-cloud capability, I wonder if he'd dare. Or if he'd just do it anyway and destroy my phone. \n\nThat's not an everyday thing - but depressingly, it's not exactly uncommon either. Most of my girlfriends have similar stories. It's been over 20 years, but every time I see one of those blue vans with the yellow letters - I feel panicky and terrified. And I fucking hate him for doing that to me. \n\nHe probably did that to 100 women. He probably never thought of me as a person, just another face and set of stories to fuel his sick fantasies.

Minor flight delay on departure. Flight was uneventful, though clear skies made for some great views out the window. It got a bit cloudy as we approached aspen, and we circled for about an hour before a descent was attempted. Pilot pulled out and said he'd try again. The second attempt also failed and they then announced they were having trouble descending. After some mumbling, it was determined that we were to be rerouted to Denver. Once we landed 3-4 hours drive away from our destination (they didn't explain why the closer Grand Junction wasn't the alternative; i assume also weather) about 2-3 hours behind schedule, we were just all told to exit and that the help desk was at some gate number. \n\nOnce I exited, I saw other expectant travelers already waiting at the gate we exited. One guy asked if we were supposed to go to Aspen and I said yes. He then informed me that he's been waiting all day only to have flight after flight to Aspen delayed, then cancelled. I checked the info board, and sure enough, all the rest of the flights were cancelled. This was a short trip for us, so I was a little worried about waiting around. \n\nWe hustled over to the help desk, and while in line, I phoned the travel insurance folks. They checked my policy, asked if flights were cancelled, and given our short trip, suggested maybe we drive. This was also the suggestion of fellow passengers who were Aspen locals. \n\nOnce I got to the desk, I provided my flight info and asked to confirm all flights were cancelled, and whether the first flight out the next morning was already full. With a smile on my face no less. The lady replied much louder than necessary, then proceeded to slow down her speech the longer she talked to me. I honestly don't know if she thought I couldn't understand English cause I'm Asian or what, but I was born in California and have a native accent. I then asked if she knew the road conditions, and if she'd recommend driving for Cali folks. Same loud tone and further slowing, just to reply \"I DO NOT KNOW THE ROAD CONDITIONS\". I said it's fine and asked if they at least had any meal vouchers as I had a connecting flight and had been at the airport or on planes since 6 AM (I had a connecting), and it was now almost 4 PM. \n\n\"NO WE DO NOT\"\n\nEh, okay that's okay. I then explain that the insurance folks, which United's website recommended, instructed me to ask for proof of cancellations. I imagine they get this all the time? \n\n\"I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT\"\n\nUhh, okay, I explain it again in more detail. \n\n\"WE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT\"\n\nWait what? You don't have access to the information that says flights are cancelled? Then how do you know to tell travelers that all remaining flights are cancelled? I kept the thought to myself, and relayed info from the insurance folks saying there's some internal website that has the schedules that'd be ideal for proof. \n\n\"NO I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT IS\"\n\nWell then. Okay. Thanks for literally nothing. She also failed to hand me this pink slip that all her coworkers were handing other passengers. Turns out, it was a coupon for stranded travelers at nearby airport hotels\n\nI think the most impatience I leaked out was the beginnings of an incredulous grin, but I stopped. At that point, we just needed to make the most of our time. \n\nAlso, she was short, overweight, thick glasses, and sweating profusely while the vast majority of customers were towering over her. I figured she had some kind of anxiety thing, or was just an incredibly anxious person. Probably not the best department to be working in if she is easily stressed, but \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nOh and to add insult to injury, despite the phone rep telling me we should be covered, and encouraging me to go ahead and rent the car for the drive to Aspen, we were denied. The flight that never reached our destination ended up costing us two fold. And the only reason we chose that weekend was because it was half the price of tickets the original weekend we had planned to go.

So I'm in line to get on my next bus and as I'm approaching the doors, they stop me when I'm about to walk through. The fucking bus was full. Why was it full you ask? Because some fucking lady and her 5 kids boarded the wrong bus previously and they got put on my bus instead since theirs had already left. \n\nI was already quite irritable by this point, and paying for someone else's dumb mistake wasn't helping. I kept my cool and went to the help desk to get a new route. The next bus headed out the way I needed to go wasn't going to arrive for TWELVE FUCKING HOURS. This royally pissed me off, especially since it wasn't due to an error on my part. I had surgery on 2 days and because of wrong bus ladies fuck up, I missed it. \n\nSo as I'm fuming at the desk (all the while assuring the lady I wasn't angry at her personally, but at Greyhound as a whole) she tells me to make up for it they were going to give me a voucher for the little cafe that was in the terminal. The voucher was worth $7.50, for one purchase. The most expensive item was a burger for $6.50. \n\nSo twelve hours of my time and a missed surgery was worth $7.50 (really only $6.50, since it only worked for one item) to them. Fucking Greyhound, never again. \n\nOh, and to make it worse, my next stop was in god damn Chicago, and the fucking driver didn't show up for her shift, so I waited another 4 hours in the middle of the night for them to find another driver. This driver didn't know the route. My mom was waiting to pick me up in Lexington this whole time since after the layover in Denver pushed my arrival time back to like 5:30AM. Once I called her and told her about the missing driver she said to just get off in Louisville and she'd pick me up there.

Her toddler's blanket has somehow been jammed into the latch while closing it, and she cannot open the hatch (it's a van).\n\nI explain that our shop is closed on Sundays (as is industry standard) and that she should call back Monday morning to book a service appointment. At this point she is agitated and wants to know if she'll have to *pay* for that kind of appointment. I assure her she would.\n\nNext she wants to know if there's a secret way to open her hatch. I tell her I have no idea and the only people who might MAYBE know if there is an alternate safety access (hah!) are the sales staff. I'm just a low paid phone attendant.\n\nSo she has me transfer the call to the sales floor. The agent who grabbed the call came over to me after it was completed, basically just awestruck at her attitude and entitlement. He'd suggested ripping the blanket out by climbing into the rear through the main seating compartment but that was completely unthinkable (heaven forbid little Timmy's blanket get ruined (hate to break it to you sweetie...)). He then said without removing the back panel of the vehicle, there was no \"secret\" way to open the trunk and force the lock.\n\nShe did not call back to book an appointment that day. She was mind boggled that she'd have to pay for service to fix her hatch, that had been working entirely until a baby blanket had gotten caught. She couldn't seem to take responsibility for the fact that her kid's lovey getting jammed was something that was user caused and \"free\" service wasn't available.

I finish changing, go outside and there's the guy that should have been my relief trying to call our supervisor on the radio, and the truck with the SBU is gone. That particular supervisor has a habit of just getting in vehicles and driving around for not reason, so whenever we are on break we hide vehicle keys so he can't drive away.

If you can document this management malfeasence it would help complete the picture of a manager who takes company property offsite while berating employees who are denied overtime and preventing employees from reaching the shift site, contributing far more to various delays than the late employee alone did.\n\nAnd the late employee needs to be written up for failing to take over his shift on time.

If it was unplugged from the wall, you would have to call the telecom department and they would schedule someone to come out in 1-5 days to plug the cable back in.\n\nIf someone else plugged the cable in, the person who did it could be fined by the telecom union for the amount a person making the most money in the entire union makes per hour for a 2 hour job.  \n\nMy job was to setup new computers and transfer over the data from one to another.

If it took over a day, we had to call someone to come babysit the machine while the transfer took place.

I decided to surprise her with the location and reserved us a table at [The Melting Pot](http://www.meltingpot.com), for 6 PM.\n\nThe restaurant was a good hour and twenty minute drive from my house, and the car gave no indication of it gonna die on me.\n\nSo at about 4:30 PM, we finished getting dressed in our fancy clothes and LK put on her makeup. Off we go! That ring box was feeling sooo conspicuous in my pocket.\n\nSo we get about half-way there, driving down I-20 (speed limit 70mph, I'm going 75), when all of a sudden the car jolts forward and losses about 3/4 it's ability to accelerate.\n\nSo I put the E-blinkers on, outwardly express a few choice words (inwardly expressing an unending string of words and shit my pants). Immediately apologize to LK and tell her we might be late to the reservation.\n\nWe're stuck in a dead zone of nothingness. We manage to get the car moving (@ 45mph, with the E-blinkers still on) and take the next exit. The only thing at that exit, was a friggin' horse ranch. No gas station. No restaurants. Nothing. So we're stuck. Turn the car off.\n\nCall the restaurant and push the reservation back to 7:00 PM, call AAA, call my parents. My dad (the mechanically inclined parent) leaves work to come take a look at the car. My mom (the one that can't work the TV) is at home, and she comes to help out too.\n\nMan, I seriously considered proposing to LK on the side of the road while I'm sweating my ass off in a suit and tie on a 98\u00b0F August day. I'm dying, trying to come up with an excuse to explain LK, why I look like I'm freaking out (though, I thought I held it in pretty well). Finally came up with, \"don't know how I'll get to work tomorrow, hun!\"\n\nMom arrives first, then dad. Dad takes a look at it and can't see anything wrong with it. It starts right up, and he decides we don't need AAA. Mom let's LK and I take her car to the restaurant, dad will take my car home, and mom will take dad's car and follow him back (You following me so far?).\n\nFinally arrived at the restaurant at 7:04 PM.  I had called the restaurant again, to let them know we were on our way. They had a \"Happy Anniversary\" card waiting on the table for us, signed by the entire staff. The food was excellent. The waitress came with the check right as we were hugging after I proposed - so LK turned beet-red from being the center of attention. Lol. She took our picture and gave us a gift bag with our picture, a magnet set, and a few other things. All-round, great experience. 10/10 would eat there again. \n\n* * * * *\n\nTL;DR: Tears fell from her eyes, sweat from my ass, and happy memories were made.

Quite a few years back when the electronic juke boxes were just coming out, at this  place I used to go to, if you put in a large amount of money in, it would play your songs next because you paid more.  There wasn't a play next option on it that I can recall.  This was really nice place too, excellent tournament tables, great atmosphere and it was fairly expensive.  I was playing pool with my buddy when an old married couple came in that had to be in the late sixties at least.  Very animated and spry, well dressed, and great pool players.  They got the table next to us.  The old man put some money in the juke box and played some old crooner classics that I was surprised were even on there.  Stuff from Sinatra, Dean Martin, Mel Torme, Sammy Davis Jr., Paul Anka, you get the idea.  A while later, several idiot young scruffy looking teens came in and got a spot several tables away.  They were loud, obnoxious, and generally insufferable little shitheads.  They didn't like what was playing and put their own money in and started playing some bad pop/rock top forty crap.  Well the old gentleman next to us would have none of that.  He went back to the jukebox and must have dropped fifty dollars or more into it and started playing his stuff again.  He came strolling back chuckling and told me and my friend \"Boys, I hope you like Sinatra\"  We replied in the affirmative, and asked him what he did,  \"You'll see\" he said with a huge smile on his face, then he went back to his wife and continued playing.  Next song up, Sinatra's New York, New York.  An extended live version that must have been several minutes long.  The teens absolutely hated it.  They hated it even more when it repeated.  Again, and again.  Finally they went to the juke box and tried to get it to play their stuff but it wouldn't come up because the old man put in more cash than these clowns probably earned in their entire lives.  They started beating on the jukebox in frustration and swearing up a storm.  The manager got tired of their bullshit, came over and threw them all out.  The old man was shaking his head and laughing at them as they got ejected.  We listened to crooner classics for the next few hours.  They were still playing after me and my friend left about two hours later.\n\nTL:DR  Old man with money overplays snotty teen pop crap on jukebox with classic crooner songs.

Quite a few years back when the electronic juke boxes were just coming out, at this  place I used to go to, if you put in a large amount of money in, it would play your songs next because you paid more.  There wasn't a play next option on it that I can recall.  This was really nice place too, excellent tournament tables, great atmosphere and it was fairly expensive.  I was playing pool with my buddy when an old married couple came in that had to be in the late sixties at least.  Very animated and spry, well dressed, and great pool players.  They got the table next to us.  The old man put some money in the juke box and played some old crooner classics that I was surprised were even on there.  Stuff from Sinatra, Dean Martin, Mel Torme, Sammy Davis Jr., Paul Anka, you get the idea.  A while later, several idiot young scruffy looking teens came in and got a spot several tables away.  They were loud, obnoxious, and generally insufferable little shitheads.  They didn't like what was playing and put their own money in and started playing some bad pop/rock top forty crap.  Well the old gentleman next to us would have none of that.  He went back to the jukebox and must have dropped fifty dollars or more into it and started playing his stuff again.  He came strolling back chuckling and told me and my friend \"Boys, I hope you like Sinatra\"  We replied in the affirmative, and asked him what he did,  \"You'll see\" he said with a huge smile on his face, then he went back to his wife and continued playing.  Next song up, Sinatra's New York, New York.  An extended live version that must have been several minutes long.  The teens absolutely hated it.  They hated it even more when it repeated.  Again, and again.  Finally they went to the juke box and tried to get it to play their stuff but it wouldn't come up because the old man put in more cash than these clowns probably earned in their entire lives.  They started beating on the jukebox in frustration and swearing up a storm.  The manager got tired of their bullshit, came over and threw them all out.  The old man was shaking his head and laughing at them as they got ejected.  We listened to crooner classics for the next few hours.  They were still playing after me and my friend left about two hours later.\n\nTL:DR  Old man with money overplays snotty teen pop crap on jukebox with classic crooner songs.

It was about fifteen feet long, and you could take images of 23 x 18, from inside a darkroom with it. It was much finer and sharper than the vertical line cameras that all newspapers use (or used to, most have gone to digital by now) because the old lenses were so much bigger. \n\n[THIS](http://static.photo.net/attachments/bboard/00M/00M1Ph-37669584.jpg) is an old line camera.

If he had had a job during the summer and was under 18... he could have gotten a bus pass for the whole summer (3 mos) for 35bucks as a student (a deal they do here), which would have let him go anywhere the bus goes for the whole summer with unlimited rides.

There are also some exigent circumstances regarding my son learning some things about growing up a bit late - call him a \"late bloomer\" if you will... but he's never been arrested, never stolen stuff, and treats the ladies kindly and respectfully. So, learning to pay back your debts, and not be a \"mooch\" is all part of growing up... and it's a lesson best learned early before losing friends over it.\n\nI know *adults* who no one will give a ride to, because they won't chip in for gas, bum cigarettes, ask for \"loans\" to get a soda etc and never pay it back, never contribute to group activities... and they wonder why everyone they know tells them to go bug someone else??? \n\nSeems like some adults could learn the lessons about real life my now-adult son is getting from me... be a decent person and ante up when you should, when someone is helping you out, and pay back what you borrow.... the latter is what the OP is teaching her son... be responsible, and it starts from the beginning of one's work experiences.\n\nSadly, too many parents \"opt out\" of *being* parents and teaching responsible behavior...the author of this post is not one... nor am I.

He doesn't \"read\" people and situations easily... so you may think it harsh to do stuff like I've mentioned between parent/young adult - but its so he learns what you probably picked up without thinking about it.

What that means is that as long as the bank loan is outstanding, the bank has a certain amount of control over the title, \"encumbering\" it and preventing you from having full ownership of the car.  The bank has the right to repossess the car in order to recover the amount of the loan (if you don't pay according to the terms), and the lien is the legal process by which this right is associated with the car's title.  This process is inherited from real property (land/houses), where the deed to a property may have a lien against it for a mortgages, HOA, or other stakeholder.\n\nThe DMV will be able to see if there is a lien on the title, either by looking at the physical document or in their computer, so they knew in this case that the owners fully owned the car, and had no loans outstanding.\n\nThis legal process can vary by jurisdiction - some areas don't use physical titles and thus liens are registered in an office only, thus making it more difficult for a private buyer to know if there is a loan outstanding (this is a problem here in Australia where I live).

At first she just seemed rude and very particular.  \"Three cinnamon raisin, one cheese-- all separate bags.\"  Things like that.  She rolled her eyes at me a few times, and when we finished with the order she said she needed water.  I was halfway through explaining the water cups at the drink station before she reached OVER the counter and grabbed a large cup from next to me.  I was too stunned to do much else but watch as she walked away.\n\nI decided to make her bagels PERFECTLY.  I took special care to do EVERYTHING she asked.  Separate bags, cream cheeses with the right bagels.  She also wanted spinach and tomato for her bagels.  I went to line and got a little to-go soup cup with a good amount of spinach and tomato, and tucked it into the bag for her.\n\nShe came back, (surprisingly she actually got water in the large cup), and she snatched her bagels away and walked out the door.  I thought it was over, and was ready to move on with my day.  This is where the fun starts.\n\nAbout 90 seconds later she storms back in, waving the bags above her head.  She storms up to me.  \"YOU!\" she snaps.\n\n\"Was there a problem, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Problem is there is no way to spread cream cheese!\"\n\n\"I put a knife in the bag, ma'am--\"\n\n\"How am I supposed to spread cream cheese while driving!?\"\n\nShe wants me to spread her cream cheese for her.  This is against policy.  They say it's for health reasons, but I think it's really just so we don't get clogged down during breakfast rush.  Either way, I'm not supposed to do it.  I try to explain this to her.  She is not having it.\n\n\"No!  No!  I come here all time, I do this all time, I never see you before!  What do you know?  You are stupid little girl!\"\n\nRemember I'm sixteen and this is my first week on my first job.  I'm close to tears.  I take the bagel bags and prepare to start spreading the cream cheese while she keeps yelling abuse over the counter.  \"Why do they hire such stupid little girls?  You know nothing!  I tell you to put bagels in separate bags, you do not even do this!\"  I did.  I took special care to.\n\nSuddenly, my manager appears at my side, cool as a cucumber.  \"Ma'am, we're not allowed to spread cream cheese on your bagel, it's a health code violation.\"\n\nI look up and watch as the gears turn in CRBL's brain.  Suddenly the gears stop and she explodes.  \"NO!  NO!  I COME HERE ALL TIME I DO THIS ALL TIME!  YOU PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING!  I COME HERE ALL TIME BUT NEVER AGAIN!  I NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!\"\n\nShe reaches OVER the counter to snatch back her bagels, touches a bunch of the pastries, and once she has her stuff, she THROWS the little cup of spinach and tomato at me.  I'm utterly shell-shocked.\n\nMy manager was great, though.  He told me to take a few minutes to calm down, just clean up the mess, sit down with a glass of water if I needed.  \n\nI started cleaning up and a new woman walked up to the counter.  She made my day when she said.  \"I just want a cinnamon roll, baby, don't you worry, that woman was crazy.\"\n\nYes.

Isn't the punishment still coming from an authority? I bet many kids do eventually learn that their actions lead to spanking, but there are also a lot that need it spelled out much clearer, who might just see the spanker as being unfair. If you teach a child to internalize values (which is much harder to do than spanking, I'll admit) you'll end up with a kid with morals. Morals are much better motivators than fear.\n\nObviously there are going to be times where you just need your kid to learn that they *cant do that thing they just did*. Maybe I was an abnormally good child, but I think time-outs get a bad rap for being \"too soft\" or something. It actually sucks to sit in your room with nothing to do, and you end up thinking about why you're in that situation. But who knows, maybe my kid will be the bouncing-off-walls type and I'll end up using spanking because the soft strategies don't work.\n\nI actually have to take back what I said about my parents never teaching me using negatives because my mom definitely passed on some catholic guilt (except that I feel guilty because I don't live up to the standards that my parents taught me, not because of God).\n\nI think the problem is that many people who were spanked as kids don't know any of the alternatives. I'm not saying spanking doesn't work, I'm just saying that it isn't the best option. It causes unneeded stress and makes children associate parents with feeling of pain and embarrassment. You should never see your parents as the source of your suffering (until you turn into an angsty teen). It's hard to recognize the negatives that come from spanking when you have nothing to compare it against, so I would say just look into the alternatives, and actually give them a try, then decide for yourself. At the end of the day, it's your decision, and there are lots of amazing people that were spanked as kids.

Here's the story, enjoy:\nI had something similar happen to me. Now I dunno how you handled your situation but I was a monster dick in how I handled mine.\nThe short version of events went down like this. This dude I had been crushing on needed a ride back to his apt from the school library, he previously made it clear he had no interest in me but he led me to believe that we would fuck around when we got to his place (gay dude here, btw and I would have given him a lift home if he just asked but he used sex to get me to do it) but when we got there he gave me some lame ass excuse that his roommate was home and was fighting with his boyfriend and consequently we couldn't fuck. I realized I was played, he had no intention of messing around with me, he just wanted a ride home and decided to take advantage of the dude with low self-esteem.\nSo a couple of months go by and I'm back in the library and we run into each other again. He's all apologetic about the last time and asks if I'm still interested. I go along with it and say sure and SURPRISE, he needs a ride back to his apt again. And again, I say sure but I need to run an errand first. He agrees to come with me. So we drive about 20 min to this place I need to go to, I apologize saying I didn't realize it was so far out, I thought it was closer, he acted cool about it, but I knew he was mad. We go into the store and I tell him \"Hey, to speed this up, can you run over to aisle x and grab this item while I get this other item.\" He says sure and off he goes in the direction I tell him. As soon as he is out of visual contact, I high tail it out, jump into my car and take off, leaving him abandoned on the outskirts of Lubbock, probably 30min+ from his apt.\nHe hits me up online later that night, pissed as hell and I just tell him \"Oh...sorry man, I had to run...my roommate was fighting with his boyfriend and I had to get home.\"\nEdit: A few people asked where I dumped his stupid ass, I cannot recall the name of the store but for those familiar with Lubbock, it was past the North Loop and 27.\nEdit: Changed a word."], [8, "Anyone got the original?

My punishment, at maybe seven years old, for wetting myself instead of holding it was to wear a diaper for the rest of the day. I was the youngest child, so I have no idea why she even still had diapers by that time, but she ripped my clothes off and made me wear nothing but a diaper for the rest of the day.\n\nThe next time, I also had to pee, but not wanting to duplicate the prior experience, I peed in the toilet and didn't flush (so she couldn't hear it), figuring to wait until she was at the other end of the house to sneak back and flush. But I washed my hands, and the only soap was the decorative seashells. And she found out, and my punishment was a spanking and doing some chores to earn the money to replace the soap that was now ruined.\n\nMy revenge?

A few students got tickets but quickly learned their lesson (HS added a new lot too, which helped), so now it's primarily homeowners getting tickets. Each and every time they are so confused \"why can't I park in front of my own house?\" Because you asked us to restrict it!\n\nIf you petition for a move like this, just remember that if affects you too, so be really clear about the change you're requesting before it's implemented.

We had a crazy neighbor who had to clear away the snow from his part of the alley in a very OCD way. He'd clear his garage apron, shovel out to the exact center of the alley, cut perfect lines on his lot lines, and then salted. It looked perfect. Unfortunately, this asshole shoveled all his snow onto everyone else's aprons. We'd open the garage door to find 2-3 feet of snow when there should only have been 8-10 inches. \n\nDo you remember about 5 years ago when we had that crazy blizzard and got 2-3-4 feet overnight?  Well, prick was out there shoveling and salting ALL NIGHT.  I open the garage door in the morning and there's a 5-6 foot wall of snow. Fuck this guy. \n\nI call the other 2 neighbors he did this to and we get to work. We KNOW he's sleeping because he was out there all night until the snow stopped. \n\nWe spent the next 3-4 hours shoveling our parts of the alley onto his apron. We essentially created a block of snow in front of his garage door. The dimensions were about 8-10 feet tall by 25 feet wide, by maybe 8-10 feet deep. I mean, we were flinging it by the end, so you couldn't even see half the roof by the end. \n\nMike, the neighbor directly behind him was the smart ass. Since jerkoff neighbor cut perfect lines along his property lines when he'd shovel, Mike packed the walls with his shovel and smoothed out the sides to be perfect verticals along his property lines.  \n\nSadly, we never heard a word about it. Jerkoff never made a peep. But the next day, a city plow came through and unburied him. Never had a problem with the snow after that. Here's what incensed is the most about it (maybe I should have mentioned this earlier)...  Jerkoff is the only guy on the block with an empty lot next to his house. He owns the empty lot!  Why can't he throw his snow there instead of equally distributing it among his neighbors?!?\n\nBtw, that's where he piled the snow after this incident, but I still don't know why he didn't do that in the first place..."], [67, "Years ago I lived in a town house community where garages were separate, but shared a wall, driveway and apron. I was also a supervisor for the local fire / EMS and always brought my department SUV home at night so I can respond from home if need be off shift. My neighbor, who we'll call Scott, was a petty, self-centered prick who could make Sheldon Cooper seem like Mother Teresa. I tried to avoid him at all costs, but I guess even THAT triggered him in some way. One winter we got almost 3 feet of snow overnight and because of the number of accidents I was called in on my day off. I open up my front door and find that Scott had piled the snow from his driveway onto mine and in front of my garage door so it won't even open (swings up instead of rolling up). Basically, I had close to 5 feet of snow blocking my garage door and trapping my official vehicle.    \nI get on the radio and notify dispatch of the situation and they roll out another supervisor to pick me up and a PD unit to deal with Scott. I was told that after I left, he was woken up and given the choice of paying the city to clear it ($500 an hour because we were in a declared emergency), shovel it himself with the PD unit supervising, or get arrested for impeding an emergency vehicle and malicious mischief. They said he was out there 3 hours shoveling, whining all the way.    \nLater that year he moved away in the middle of the night leaving all kinds of trash behind (apparently he was some kind of hoarder) like empty chip wrappers, hot pocket sleeves, piles of newspaper, you get the picture. The head of the HOA asked me to go through the vacant house with him since I was a public official. I have dealt with hoarders before, but this guy had issues. His toilet apparently broke and instead of fixing it, he would wipe and place the paper in the trash. When the bag got full, instead of throwing it out, he tossed it into a closet.
