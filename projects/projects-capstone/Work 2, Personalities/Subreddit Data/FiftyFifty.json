The field is very weak - it wouldn't have much effect on the metal blade.\n\nWhen you create a loop, the field created *inside* the loop by each point on the loop lines up with the field crated by every other point on the loop. All of the magnetic field lines point through the center of the loop. Even so, it's still pretty weak, but it starts to add up.\n\nHowever, if you then also *coil* it, the combined effect of the field created by each loop also lines up with the other loops - all oriented lengthwise through the center of the coil. 10 loops in a coil = 10 times the concentrated field of a single loop. *Now* we're really talking about a serious magnetic field! It's even strong enough to move metal objects with significant mass. Similar principle as using a concave reflective surface or a magnifying glass to concentrate sunlight into a focused beam so hot that that can set things on fire.\n\nSo that's why the coil shape matters. Even more useful is the fact that this powerful field only exists when electric current is running through the wire, which is a thing we can control. It allows precise control of when these powerful magnetic fields exist - i.e., electromagnets.\n\nThis discussion can get bogged down in the math (which requires integrating the strength of the field over various 3D surfaces... very heady stuff), but the plain facts of what's actually occurring are awesome.

What I remember was this:\n\nHis grandparents lived in a small village in Russia during the Russian famine of 21/22. They were relatively well off, and they had a family milk cow and a child, redditor's grandad. After a while they bring the milk cow into the home and it comes in to live with them, for fear of it being stolen. After a while they begin to fear that the neighbours will kill them for the cow or something, so they send their boy off to a neighbouring village to sell the cow. After concluding (maybe, I don't remember too rightly here) his business in town the kid was chased by a gang of people brandishing weapons. It was later revealed that these people were running human chop-shop operations and op's grandad had narrowly avoided being butchered for food.\n\nMaybe this guy was trying to write a creepypasta, maybe not. I've read about things just as horrible that are true. If you guys could help me find the comment chain, that would be great. I'm getting fuckin' nothin' here.\n\nEdit: I found [this.](http://allday.com/post/1255-infamous-incidents-of-cannibalism/) \n> A combination of crappy new Soviet food collection tactics and a particularly fierce winter snowballed into a terrifying holiday season of people-eating. At the end of it: 2,505 people in the Ukraine alone were charged and jailed for cannibalistic crimes. Thousands more were guilty in the rest of the USSR. But nobody outside of Russia knew about it, until 1990 when glasnost meant the images of ghastly human butcher shops and feasts were among the sealed-off history finally released to the west. \n\nStill digging.", "id": "d7mw5z1"}, {"comment": "And the people who caused it will never be brought to justice.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRks8in-w_c", "id": "d7n189p"}, {"comment": "O YEA IT WUZ DA JOOZ. \n\nFuck outta here with that shit.", "id": "d7ne8q2"}, {"comment": "It wasn't \"The Jews\" but a large percentage of the soviet intelligentsia were jewish, way way more than you'd expect given the jewish population of the USSR.

I don't know a lot about diving but I believe this is how manage to survive the jumps themselves.  Although the diver's cross section is small, as you pointed out, it is in fact larger than that of a brick.\n\nNow this is the part that I'm particularly interested in: i believe that because the brick is more dense than the diver coupled with the smaller cross section of the brick should ensure that the brick sinks at a faster rate than the diver.\n\nI think it's quite interesting regardless.

Nothing is black & white. It's various different shades of grey.  Your sources just seem to align with right-wing islamophobics.\n\nAnd anyways, the verses you cite don't *specifically* mention non-believers. They could be describing a civil war for all we know. Especially Qu'ranic verse 8.65 could be talking about greater jihad (the struggle within oneself) for all we know.\n\n>yet none of them terrorizes the world like islam does right now... \n\nAnd yet in the past Islamic extremism wasn't in the limelight, in 5 or 10 years the limelight could've shifted on to something else. Would you still hold the same views then?\n\n>on top of that you're not the one to decide what a \"misinterpretation\" is, every muslim has his own interpretation thus you're not to decide the real interpretation...\n\nI never said I was the one to decide, I used the phrase \"matter of perspective\" meaning that every muslim has their own interpretation I was also just pointing out these extremist views are either a misinterpretation or fiction. \n\n>i give you a deeper look on the mindset of a worry some percentage of them and on how far they would go to defend islam...\n\nI understand that a percentage of Muslims have beliefs that can be deemed questionable e.g. look at Channel 4's \"What British Muslims Really Think (2016) that doesn't mean we should shun them we  should just deradicalise them but let them keep their deradicalised faith.\n\n\n", "id": "d4arprl"}, {"comment": "People were being burned in human ovens around the same time.

The other is you stab the neck as far back as possible with a two sided blade or with a single sided blade facing forward.
