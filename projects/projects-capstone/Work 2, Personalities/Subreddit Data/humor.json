Money doesn't compound with money; money compounds with *time*. From my example, every dollar you pay into student loans now will be worth $1.63 in reduced loans in 10 years. Every dollar you invest will be worth $2.16 in cash in 10 years. This means that for every dollar you invest instead of using to pay down your loan, you'll be 53 cents richer in 10 years.

If you want to make the largest majority of people laugh from many different backgrounds, languages and cultures you have to remove a lot of what would be funny to a few in order to make it funny for the many. Important when doing translations to other languages as well. Take the new Star Wars for instance, it lacked any and all depth. It literally walked the audience through the plot the entire way, even to the point where characters spent time explaining the plot so people who had never even heard of Star Wars would be able to follow. It wasn't a movie for fans of Star Wars, it was a movie designed to reach the largest global audience possible so it could make as much money as possible. Regardless of how anyone feels about George Lucas, it's easy to tell this wasn't one of his movies (they didn't want his script for Episode 7). Lucas already has all the money and fame a person could possibly ever want, so he would have made Episode 7 for people who loved Star Wars. Disney, on the other hand, was only interested in how much money they could extract from people's pockets so they took the best parts of the other Star Wars movies, changed a few names of places/people, and did a reboot."]], [[{"comment": "This seems to have changed with modern American comedy.

One last job for a just released con so he can retire.

It wasn't a movie for fans of Star Wars, it was a movie designed to reach the largest global audience possible so it could make as much money as possible. Regardless of how anyone feels about George Lucas, it's easy to tell this wasn't one of his movies (they didn't want his script for Episode 7). Lucas already has all the money and fame a person could possibly ever want, so he would have made Episode 7 for people who loved Star Wars.

For reference, the Su-24 is *more than 70 feet long.* That is substantially longer than an 18 wheeler. The plane in the publicized image is not as close as it might appear; it's just freaking huge.

Now consider that we're talking about what can be mounted on a naval vessel expressly designed to detect, identify, track, and shoot down not just aircraft, but large numbers of inbound missiles.

That's a comparably easy task for long range targeting/recon optics since it's very easy to tell empty hardpoints from loaded ones from the aircraft's silhouette. I suspect the Aegis radar system, since it can identify the fighter type from range, can probably figure that out from the radar signature alone. If you can't figure it out, you'd get some fighters in the air and get on top of that LONG before the bogeys are anywhere close to launch range.\n\nIf nothing else, a Hornet with appropriate targeting pod can tell you what the jets are carrying from 20++ miles out.

My wife's sister is annoying at times and has add but she also has cancer so when kids start stuff with her she will defend herself and talk back, as all teens do, and she will expect her cancer to protect her. She has never gotten in a physical fight the last 3 years until now. But over 3 years she has reported MA y kids and even teachers telling her things from she is stupid to literally threatening to kill her. Not just\" I'll kill you\" but they know she has a tumor and have threatened to slam her head on the left side to try and kill her. About 2 months ago she broke some foot bones and 2 weeks ago a male got in a fight with her male friend and while trying to break it up, the male purposefully stomped on her foot. The school did nothing even though a coach saw it. 2 weeks later, this last Monday, this same kid had two girls attack her but I have also taught her how to fight so she actually beat the shit out of the 2 girls but in the fight they were yelling to each other to kick her foot and left side of her head as they knew what would happen. So after this fight all 3 girls and the male were suspended for fighting. They broke her glasses but luckily here insurance covered it. Besides the suspension the school isn't doing shit about it. No one said a word, the 2 girls just attacked her because the male lied and said she was calling them where's or some shit. \n\nTeachers have treated her like shit and make her leave class for \"being disrupive\" even though she was just trying to get help from the teacher as she needs extra help. She has a tumor on her left optic nerve that is also pushing on her frontal lobe so she is great at some things but she is bad at others like math and science. Things just don't click for her at times. But the teachers would rather send her out than help her for 5 minutes more and then she gets a bit of an attitude and the teachers yell at her.

They are justifying (to themselves) their theft by the person leaving it unattended or that they needed it more than the owner. I have a brother like this. He got his girlfriend to pretend to be my younger sister and they hooked up all their utilities using her name and info. Of course they never made payment one. So my sister who was in college and the national guard and working part to full time depending on the week got a notice that they were going to turn off her utilities and the utilities at her \"other \" apartment because she owed over $800 just in electric. My sister had during this time bought them food, given them rides back and forth, and had been watching the two girls and the baby for free while brother and his girlfriend were \"out looking for work\". \n\n When she confronted him he cried that they had a new baby and that they were trying to get custody of his girlfriend's daughters who were taken by the state. So my sister being young and not quite familiar with his bullshit agreed to give him a week to take it out of her name and pay the bills. Of course he didn't and when she finally had to have it cut off and the other utilities and get the cell phone out of her name that he had signed up for he went ballistic. He brought his girlfriend and they burst into my sister's apartment threatening to kick her ass. Not an idle threat as he'd been in prison with two separate incidents of assaulting police officers in the charges. She called the police and he left. \n\nMy mother and her father (my stepdad)put their heads together with my brother and came up with my sister was in the wrong. Completely in the wrong. How could she betray her brother that way? Oh and they pressured her into not reporting the identity theft and she wound up paying the utilities back herself. I begged her not to but she didn't want them upset with her. \n\nPeople who act like this do so because they justify it to themselves, and they have people in their lives who have reinforced their \"right\" to use and abuse the rest of us.

We both like blue.\n\n- Served an old woman who I thought had an impressive mustache, but it was just nose hair\n\n- Watched her and two other women with her get trapped between two sets of automatic doors because they did not understand how to open them. How they got through the first set, I still do not know.\n\n- Sold fifteen gallons of kitty litter to a soccer mom who refused to break eye contact\n\n- Got a second free starbucks drink. This one was a pumpkin pie one that wasn\u2019t even on the menu. I like this barista man.\n\n- Gave dozens of children stickers. Several of them squealed when they got them. This is the best part of my job.\n\n- Sold an old man $200 of furniture and got him to sign up for a Target credit card. Before he finished the last step, he turned and walked away with his cart without a word.\n\n- He still hadn\u2019t paid. I called him back and he apologized, saying \u201csorry, sometimes my diabetes makes me do that.\u201d He didn\u2019t finish getting the card.\n\n- A woman came up with $220 of items. After a wad of coupons and a stack of free gift cards from other promotions, her total went down to $55. I want her to teach me. \n\n- Saw a girl skipping down the aisle in what can only be described as a pink princess fairy wedding dress. She was filled with happiness and if I hadn\u2019t been on the clock I would have taken her. At the very least, I want that outfit for my own.\n\n- Got approached by a large man named Jason. He told me not to steal. I will take this advice to heart. \n\n- Met a woman referred to only as The Cat Lady. She asked if I wanted her to buy me a keychain from Ross. I told her I had no keys. She nodded solemnly and walked away, whispering their exact location inside Ross, just in case. \n\n- Got called into the HR Head\u2019s office at the end of my shift. I was expecting to be yelled at for some reason. She and another lead showered me in compliments for ten minutes straight, saying a lot of managers had been saying great things about me all day. Not what I expected, but I\u2019ll take it.\n\n**Day Two:**\n\n- Intimidating farmer man in overalls and pigtails came through my checkout. He bought a bucket. He spoke no words. He made no eye contact. He left me with questions.\n\n- Three college boys came through, each buying spandex and makeup wipes. They spoke no words. They made too much eye contact. They left me with more questions. I question when this job will provide answers.\n\n- A three year old came through, pushed by his personal chauffeur. He bought one small Spider-Man onesie. He carried out the entire transaction on his own. He was the most polite customer I have had so far.\n\n- Three people walked away without their change. Only two returned.\n\n- A man bought thirty light bulbs with a coupon. He told me he did not need thirty light bulbs. He just likes coupons.\n\n- He then walked to customer service, claiming to have returned several things he did not mean to. He then walked a lap around the store and left. He did not leave the store with his light bulbs. They were nowhere to be found.\n\n- A customer came through looking nervous. She leaned over the counter. She whispered to me. Someone had pooped in the baby supplies aisle. All evidence pointed to it not being a baby.  \n\n**Day Three:**\n\n- Two children came through the line. They were chanting to their mom through heavy streams of tears. \u201cWE WANT STICKERS MOMMY.\u201d  There were no stickers at any of the registers. They continued crying. I failed my people.\n\n- An old woman bought five bottles of wine and a large bottle of vodka. Her license told me she had lived through World War II. Her smile told me she was still living.\n\n- I sorted through the candy in the checkout lanes. I was meant to set aside candy that had expired in the last month. A box of Kit Kats was found that had expired in February of 2015. One was missing. I hope the poor sap is okay.\n\n- Clearance school supplies have arrived. A man bought 71 spiral notebooks for $6. A woman bought 110 folders for $4. I hope they meet each other. I would like to see the child of two math problem characters.\n\n- A bearded man named Rusty came through. I sold him a bottle of Crystal Light powder and a gallon of water. The powder was empty. The water jug had an inch of pink water left in it. How long has he been inside the store already. His beard intimidated me too much to ask.\n\n- An elderly man in a fedora pushed two full carts into my lane. They were both filled to the brim. He bought 52 12-packs of Mountain Dew. 12 were diet. He repeatedly told me he was 80 years old. As I handed him his receipt, he leaned in and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to get DRUNK.\u201d He pointed at his carts, smiled at me, and scurried away with his definitively alcoholic purchase. I wonder if he knows. I wonder if he cares.\n\n**Day Four:**\n\n- The store is having a 10% off your entire purchase sale. I have a coupon to scan if anyone asks for it. I scan it if people don\u2019t ask for it if they\u2019re nice to me. I don\u2019t scan it if they\u2019re rude. Power is a new sensation. Power is a good sensation.\n\n- Because of the sale, we have been flooded with guests itching for a bargain. When I need to go on my break, the manager has to stand in front of the line and tell people to go somewhere else. As the line died down, I prepared to leave. A new wave of people approached. She whispered to me \u201crun as soon as you can.\u201d I did not see her after my break.\n\n- An old man comes through the line and loudly announces that \u201cthis is a cash thing. No cards!\u201d His clarity is appreciated, but also questioned. \n\n- A young man follows him. He jokes, \u201cthis is a card thing. No cash!\u201d His smile shows he was a kind man. His joke shows he was a dad. \n\n- A confused teenager follows after.  He whispers, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.cash\u201d. He thinks he has to announce his payment type. I do not correct him. \n\n- Children continue to handle their own transactions. This makes my day good. One girl had her own wallet and told me \u201cthank you for your help, sir\u201d. This makes my day great.\n\n- Five hours into my shift, I discover small figurines of Bambi and Pluto behind my register screen. Knowing that I am experiencing the happiest place on earth for a bargain price is nice.\n\n- A customer purchased hard salami. The store sells a product called hard salami. How anyone can work or shop here with a straight face remains beyond me.\n\n- A small girl waits in the cart as her mother pays for her transaction. She decides she had enough. She shouts, \u201cLet me out of here!\u201d She attempts to leave the cart. She realizes the walls are too tall. She sits down and accepts her fate with a shocking level of grace.\n\n- A grown man sees a coloring book on a shelf. He calls after his wife, who has already walked away. \u201cThere\u2019s a coloring book here. This is just pitiful.\u201d No one has any response for this.\n\n- I met a man who looked like Harry Potter if, instead of getting out of the cupboard at age eleven, he stayed in there for fifteen more years with nothing but Red Bull and My Chemical Romance albums.\n\n- A woman gets 69 cents back in change. I know that I will likely get reprimanded if I make a 69 joke to a customer. I do not speak to the customer any further. I am trying to decide if it is worth losing my job or not.\n\n- A little girl in basketball shorts kicks the candy rack multiple times. I expect her to turn around and show that she is throwing a fit. Instead, she seems calm and please. She is having the time of her life. I look forward to seeing where life takes her.\n\n- A child in my lane gets a toy. A child in the next lane yells at him for having a toy when he does not. Toy-having child prepares to throw the toy at toy-lacking child. Parents pick up their respective children. Thus ends the Baby Feud of 2016.\n\n**Day Five:**\n\n- I open my register. An octogenarian woman approaches. She purchases bras and lingerie. I cry on the inside. It is too early for these images.\n\n- A small girl helped me put her parents bags into their cart. Every time I hand her a bag, she digs through it, announcing which things are hers and which are her parents, and putting her parents\u2019 items in the cart without the bag. They did not earn the bag and she treats them accordingly.\n\n- A group of old people came on a field trip to Target and spent ten minutes discussing the new Jungle Book movie before buying a copy. Their reviews were overwhelmingly positive and gleeful.\n\n- The DVD ran $18.94. The group banded together, pulling out every coin they could find to ensure they gave me exact change. They must have had ten dollars in coins between them. The strength of their teamwork inspired me. The depth of their pockets confounded me.\n\n- A fly flew directly into my nostril before bouncing around and making a swift exit. I was more impressed by its aim than bothered by its decisions.\n\n- A woman seemingly stepped out of the 19th century prairie to purchase a frappucino. I think her dress was handmade. Her head scarf still had a price tag. \n\n- An old couple came through my lane to purchase gardening tools. Anytime one of them turned their back to the other, they would be tickled without warning or mercy. I believe I have just had a glimpse into my future.\n\n- A very angry old man pulled two full carts through. He purchased a Twix bar, a bottle of Diet Pepsi, 36 pairs of underwear, and 262 adult diapers. I believe I have just had another glimpse into my future.", "id": "d7a8sbe"}, {"comment": "Dang, talk about the extra mile :P\n\nNow someone write the HTML code for the website.

He had multiple chances to leave the country. In his prime and thereafter, any country in the world would have taken him in with pride. Even with all the horrible things he suffered through in that point in our history, Ali chose to stay here of his own free will. Not because he was a slave or because he was too poor to leave, but he stayed because despite all of our struggles America was still the greatest bastion of freedom in the world. But with all that freedom comes a price: defending it against our enemies.\n\nLooking back, it's easy to criticise our entrance to the Asian theatre in the sixties and seventies. It was clearly contrived and international laws were twisted in order to \"combat communism\", in particular we were attempting to slow down China's advances throughout the region. We were wrong and it was not our fight, but it was fairly voted on and the people's representatives all had a voice. This then became the responsibility of the everyday US Citizens, to either fight or to force our politicians to rethink this conflict. It took too long for the people to gain a voice and stand up to stop the conflict and the turmoil that was Civil Rights still had most of the country divided, making that voice weak and ineffectual for far longer than it should have.\n\nUltimately, reason won through.

Although after doing some \"research\" and can explain why there are so many fucked up. \n\nBasically in some cases the mother in the relationship has family issues and/or is uncomfortable being Asian in western society. She ultimately views the west as being superior to her own roots and also views white men as also being superior to men of her own race. Now when she marries regardless of the quality of the man she chooses. She will carry the weight of self hatred into her motherhood. If she were to have a daughter the daughter will most likely just carry on her mothers interpretations of the East. However if she has a son. Her son will feel alienated by his mothers hatred of Asian men as he himself is an Asian man. This situation happens more frequently with Asian American women and less so with Asians from Asia. Although there are definitely cases where the mother is directly from Asia. \n\nIn cases where the relationship is based out of the mail order bride situation, the effects on the children are slightly different. Mail order bride as obvious as it is are escaping the poverty and dead end life they live in their native countries. They aren't marrying so much because they hate their culture but out of desperation to escape from poverty. The effects on the kids aren't necessarily the same. The mother will most likely have a slightly healthier view of her homeland and culture as her marriage is based out of escaping poverty less so issues with her roots. I'm sure there are cases where there is some of that but I can imagine it being rare. In my case my mom was born in Asia to an American man and Asian woman. Her mother still valued traditions and her homeland. My mother still was critical of her roots but no where near some of the mothers many Hapas have. \n\nUltimately it's best not to get into a relationship with someone who hates their race.

But that's a hypothetical. In reality we *did* vote to maybe shoot ourselves in the foot. We know we're not going to start the process until at least October (when we most likely get a new PM) so if the economy doesn't bounce back and this turns out to verifiably be a bad idea, will we still go through with it?\n\nA lot of politicians who supported this are backpeddaling on it already, and a lot of rich people lost a LOT of money when the vote was announced, so it may be that by October a lot of powerful people and a majority of voters will think it's a bad idea, and if that does happen, it'll be fascinating to see what happens. It'll be a real test of how democratic we are as a country I think. Will we follow the will of the people even if it damages the country, or will we over-ride it or have a \"do-over\" for the sake of keeping the train on the tracks? If the latter happens, it'll be really interesting to see how some people justify it. I've already heard a lot of anti-democratic rhetoric from a lot of my friends who are on the left and I'm finding the whole process really interesting to watch.\n\nOf course, that's all assuming that leaving the EU turns out to be a bad call.

Hillary Clinton was the first New Yorker to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee and made veterans a main focus. She introduced the Heroes at Home Act in 2006 and 2007 to help family members care for those with Traumatic Brain Injury. She also worked to increase the military survivor benefit from $12,000 to $100,000, and cosponsored the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act to extend benefits provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Hillary also worked across the aisle to keep the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station open during a time when the Pentagon was shuttering bases, which saved 800 jobs in upstate New York.\n\n\u2022 Hillary Clinton, as a U.S. Senator, worked with Republicans to expand health care for National Guard members and reservists. According to McClatchy, then-Senator Clinton worked with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to \u201cprovide full military health benefits to reservists and National Guard members.\u201d A statement from Graham\u2019s senate office said, \u201cSenators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) today announced that the Department of Defense Authorization bill conference report finalized today includes an amendment that will improve TRICARE benefits for National Guard members and Reservists, allowing all members of the Selected Reserve and their families to enroll in TRICARE with an across the board cost-sharing of 28 percent. Today\u2019s victory builds on the Senators\u2019 longstanding commitment to ensuring that members of our National Guard and Reserve and their families have access to the health care benefits they need and deserve.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Hillary stepped up for New York in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, fighting hard to secure funds for medical assessment, referrals and outreach for 9/11 rescue and recovery workers, and volunteers.\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\n\u2022 As Senator, Hillary Clinton fought to pass the DREAM Act and comprehensive immigration reform, helping to cultivate awareness of the issues in Congress. She introduced the Legal Immigrant Children\u2019s Health Improvement Act, which would give states the option to provide federally funded Medicaid and SCHIP benefits to low-income legal immigrant children and pregnant women. She also wrote the Access to Employment and English Acquisition Act to meet the growing demand for English language courses and other job skills.\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\n\u2022 Hillary wrote a law as Senator providing grants to state and local governments to pay for respite care services for family caregivers, which allows expanded funding for temporary breaks for caregivers of sick or disabled people.\n\n\u2022 One of Hillary\u2019s Senate bills to distribute flu vaccines more efficiently inspired provisions of a law promoting the production and stockpiling of vaccines to improve our response to public health emergencies.\n\nWOMEN & CHILDREN\n\n\u2022 Hillary Clinton worked in the Senate to strengthen the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, introducing multiple bills allowing states to expand the program that she helped create as First Lady. The program, created in 1997, increased health coverage for children in low income and working families. Hillary also co-wrote a law compelling drug companies to conduct safety tests for products prescribed for children, and wrote a component of the No Child Left Behind Act authorizing funding for recruiting and retaining better teachers.\n\n\u2022 Hillary Clinton was a powerful advocate for women in the Senate and was one of the original cosponsors of the Prevention First Act to increase access to family planning. As Senator she was a strong defender of a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\n\nEDIT: when presented with a fact or two the wild conservative will immediately seek refuge under an umbrella of child like name calling.", "id": "d4n7i27"}, {"comment": "Come on you two, you're in /r/humor right now.

Hecklers are a way of life. and drunk hecklers who think they are part of the show or actually funny themselves are more common than comedians themselves.\nSo you have to actually hone your skills by practicing on stage in front of real live (and usually drunk) audiences.\nSo the real question isn't \"who's funnier, men or women?\", it's \"who's more willing to subject themselves to the degrading nature of putting themselves up on a stage and opening themselves to ridicule in order to hone their craft?\"\nWomen are far less likely to subject themselves to the critical tearing down by drunken strangers while under a spotlight. Sure, the innapropriate comments from the men can be harsh, but comediannes like Sarah Silverman thrive off of it and use it in their act. It's the women that are more brutal to the female comedians though.\nEveryone bombs on stage at one time or another. It takes a lot to go through the torture of being onstage to get good at your craft. More often than not, they choose not to go out on stage by themselves because the women in the audience are far more brutal in tearing down female comedians than men are to either male or female comedians.\nAnd again, referring back to Sarah Silverman, many of them fall back on the vulgar references for shock value, mainly because there is a portion of their audience that expects it. They give the audience what they want. But a lot of people tire of the routine, especially if that is all they rely on is just shock value. (See Andrew Dice Clay's dead career).\nSo most funny female entertainers prefer to show off their skills in more controlled environments like scrited TV and movies, without hecklers in their faces. The downside then becomes a lot of the time they are going off of someone else's material, and even the best performance can't always save the lamest written joke."], [-17, "The real question is whether or not Bill Burr can be funny"], [-3, "[Shoes! lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv-7feBZtGQ)"]], [[{"comment": "There's probably less of a societal pressure on women to be funny, therefore you have less female comics.

One thing I've noticed in my extremely amateur standup career is that women can get a lot more laughter from \"blue humor\" (dirty jokes).\n\nMy first open mic night, I thought my best joke would be my dick joke-- it was about how I referred to my junk as Mr. Fantastic due to the Marvel hero, because if I got an STD, I could call it the Human Torch or the Thing without leaving continuity (and because it was generally only visited by the Invisible Woman (here I would hold up my hand and look sad)). I thought it was hilarious, and it got a few polite chuckles. The market is supersaturated with dick jokes. Every young male comedian writes dick jokes, so no matter how creative you are, the audience has heard them. \n\nNow, contrast this with, say, Garfunkel and Oates-- hilarious female comedy team, and this doesn't detract from them in any way, shape, or form. But they make jokes about their vaginas (\"I'm sorry we won't actually break up with you in person because we are what we have-- huge pussies! Well, *you* maybe....\") and they're hilarious. Everyone, myself included, was laughing pretty hard at these because they were just plain funny! It's humor that we haven't been saturated with like the dick jokes.\n\nAnd they're not the only ones by any means, and there are certainly some comics who actively avoid the blue humor (Chelsea Paretti springs to mind for doing a whole segment making fun of male comics for miming sex with a stool when she passively took it from the stool), and it's almost never a successful comedian's only style of joke-- but it does generally get better results for women than for men. \n\nAlso, my all-time favorite dirty joke ever comes from a woman doing open mic night at a tiny bar in New Zealand. \"I don't understand how other women don't get attached after one night stands!

Hecklers are a way of life. and drunk hecklers who think they are part of the show or actually funny themselves are more common than comedians themselves.\nSo you have to actually hone your skills by practicing on stage in front of real live (and usually drunk) audiences.\nSo the real question isn't \"who's funnier, men or women?\", it's \"who's more willing to subject themselves to the degrading nature of putting themselves up on a stage and opening themselves to ridicule in order to hone their craft?\"\nWomen are far less likely to subject themselves to the critical tearing down by drunken strangers while under a spotlight. Sure, the innapropriate comments from the men can be harsh, but comediannes like Sarah Silverman thrive off of it and use it in their act. It's the women that are more brutal to the female comedians though.\nEveryone bombs on stage at one time or another. It takes a lot to go through the torture of being onstage to get good at your craft. More often than not, they choose not to go out on stage by themselves because the women in the audience are far more brutal in tearing down female comedians than men are to either male or female comedians.\nAnd again, referring back to Sarah Silverman, many of them fall back on the vulgar references for shock value, mainly because there is a portion of their audience that expects it. They give the audience what they want. But a lot of people tire of the routine, especially if that is all they rely on is just shock value. (See Andrew Dice Clay's dead career).\nSo most funny female entertainers prefer to show off their skills in more controlled environments like scrited TV and movies, without hecklers in their faces.
