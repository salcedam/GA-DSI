Torilla tavataan! which means Finland mentioned, see you at the market square? If you haven't, try searching reddit or use google. It's everywhere.  \n\nIt's because finnish media and finnish people in general tend to make a huge fuss about it every time Finland gets any international visibility. There are literally news on Finnish media about news about Finland in other countries. I'm not kidding, it's crazy. Many people think it's ridiculous and thus the [jokes](http://i.imgur.com/5HIOMrx.jpg) about it.\n\nThe thing about meeting people in the market square comes from the [celebrations](http://i.imgur.com/uSVnZMB.jpg) after Finland won the [ice hockey world championship](http://i.imgur.com/wz7R1Dy.jpg), and when [Lordi won the Eurovision song contest](http://i.imgur.com/icZOKWN.jpg). There were huge celebrations organized and the slogan was \"torilla tavataan\". The joke behind the meme is that all Finland should celebrate whenever Finland is mentioned internationally because it's a huge fucking deal. Just ask anybody.\n\nAbout a month ago Finland's foreign ministry launched a set of [Finland's official emojis](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-34720765) that according to them represent *important things associated with Finland*. The First one I posted was the one that represent the whole \"torilla tavataan\" mentality and is something of a visual representation of the meme. If I had to guess, the picture itself is heavily influenced by [this image](https://i.imgur.com/D492Xfy.jpg). Notice the same statue in both.\n\nThe woman with the wonky eyes that I replied to is a former President of Finland, [Tarja Halonen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarja_Halonen). You know, the one that kind of looks like [Conan O'Brien](http://i.imgur.com/DjBRdMV.jpg). So... Suomi mainittu! Torilla tavataan!\n\nThe second one is also from the [official set](http://imgur.com/a/hoTjX) and is clearly meant to mimic [this image](https://i.imgur.com/rToE33A.jpg).

One is infinitely more complex than the other. NBA players are drafted because they are objectively good at basketball or have the potential to be objectively good at basketball. In the dating world partners are chosen for a multitude of different subjective reasons.\n\nAnd it's a complex combined racial and non-racial issue. You mention a meritocracy. Tell me what qualities merit one a highly desirable mate? Is being a highly desirable mate subjective or objective? Where do we get our perceptions and beliefs of what makes a highly desirable mate?\n\nMedia and society has proliferated certain stereotypes and tropes of different races. I'm sure you're aware of the skinny, nerdy, effeminate asian male trope for example. In modern society there is a subjective value of a person solely based upon their race. Of course your other features can override that. But you'll always be seen as lesser or greater because of your racial background because society has certain beliefs and ideas about what races and features are subjectively better and has therefore attached a value to different races. Undoubtedly, in western media and society caucasian features are seen as subjectively better. And due to western medias global reach these ideas have proliferated around the world. In all countries and groups of people. Black people have the paper bag test where caucasian traits like lighter skin are valued, same goes for india where lighter skin is valued, and Asia where wider eyes are more valued, and even in South America namely Brazil where caucasian features are prided and indigenous, african features are seen as lesser.\n\nSo yes many Asian people (both men and women) are being taught that Asian features are lesser and have developed a sense of self-hatred and reverence of whites and white features. Asian women are more easily about to find white partners because society fetishes Asians and derides Asian males.\n\nThe issue is that the beliefs and ideas society is pushing in regards to Asians and Whites is not healthy and promoting interracial relationships with unhealthy expectations and rationales. Plus as a hapa (mixed race asian) male, many of us are born looking nearly entirely asian and have to deal not only with societies derision and mockery of asian males, but being an outcast from asians too and being raised by a mom steeped in those \"whites and white traits are better, asians and asian traits are lesser\" subconscious or conscious beliefs and a dad that you can't connect with at all because he's white and you're asian and he married your mom because he disliked western women \"plagued by feminism\" and wanted a submissive asian wife or had an asian fetish/innane beliefs about asian women or because he was low enough on the dating pool that he had to settle for asians. And when you get a half asian kid with parents like that you start seeing people like Elliot Rodger or Matthew Holtzclaw or Matthew DeGrood or Thomas Wagoner coming into this world.\n\nI'm well aware a lot of what i say is controversial and maybe you disagree with a lot of it, but it is a topic growing more interest each and everyday. Again i recommend you to talk and checkout /r/hapas and if you don't know \"hapa\" is a mixed race asian person. So the people there are sons and daughters of these relationships and speak first hand of growing trends and beliefs in asian interracial relationships.", "id": "d1onued"}, {"comment": ">it's a false equivalency \n\nIt's not a false equivalence at all, it was an analogy to illustrate my point. The analogy works as intended: the choosers in both cases are doing so based on a multitude of preferences. The racial inequality is the results of this non-racial process, not the cause.\n\nAnd you seem to get the cause and effects wrong in the rest of your post as well. For example, Bernie Madoff has a reputation for scamming clients. But he wasn't forced to scam clients because he has that reputation. He earned that reputation because he scammed clients. Similarly, women tend to universally prefer certain traits like height. This preference is the cause, not the effect, of the stereotype of women liking taller men. And this is one of the traits that there's clearly a pretty big discrepancy among the races.\n\nI definitely agree that arbitrary preferences for race can play a factor, but it is a minuscule factor. Even in a brainwashed society like North Korea, where foreigners are literally demonized, I bet women still have very similar preferences to their Southern neighbors who are apparently brain washed by Western media.", "id": "d1oq6qf"}, {"comment": "I felt it was not comparable because in assigning value to basketball players you are weighing mostly objective facts (high assist to turnover ratio, field goal percentage, defensive winshares, etc), but in assigning value to potential partners there are more subjective factors (personality, humor, interests, etc) but i got your point.\n\nAnd i get cause and effect, you've misunderstood me. My main point was that media has pushed certain caucasian traits to be more desirable (blonde hair, blue eyes, high cheekbones, etc) and derided asian traits (epicanthal folds and monolids). Definitely women universally prefer taller and stronger men. However there is definitely evidence of a racial bias seeing as average height of african americans is taller than the average height of a caucasian american yet Asian women are 14x more likely to marry a caucasian male than they are to marry an african american male. And unlike foreign asian populations the average height of asian americans is comparable to the average height of the average american male so theres not much of a height discrepancy. \n\nSpeaking from the perspective as a POC and as one of asian american descent, It's not a minuscule issue, it's actually pretty widespread and a significant issue. There's a ton of info and data on this, i'll edit this post and add it later. \n\nI'm all on the side for interracial marriage and dating. Like you said it's the 21st century.

This is the part where you tell us about Vanessa Lorezo's boobs...", "id": "cz04j7o"}, {"comment": "Alright but this is kind of a long one:\n\nPrecursor: I had to drive the entire photo-shoot team up to a spot that the art director deemed feasible to shoot at. This was WAY fucking higher up the mountain than I should have tried taking them. We made it about half as far as they had intended to go before they started to get scared and asked me to find a flat spot to park the cat. \n\n[The cat](https://www.google.com/search?espv=2&rlz=1C1QJDB_enUS595US595&biw=1536&bih=794&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=blue+spryte+snowcat&oq=blue+spryte+snowcat&gs_l=img.3...8235.9123.0.9408.5.5.0.0.0.0.66.294.5.5.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0.EjtVraJu1uo#imgrc=Q8jQ02UlaWieVM%3A) was slipping all over the place and actually preety freaky to drive.\n\nWe parked. This was at about 7500 ft elevation at Timberline Ski Area (Palmer snow field) One of my jobs during the actual shoots, was to keep gawkers at bay. I had to intercept them and tell them to fuck off. \n\nThis particular spot was troublesome because of the sheer amount of traffic. Palmer snow field is one of the only places to snowboard/ski in north America during the summer. Timberline is like a Mecca of skiing and snowboarding in the summer.There were LOTS of people around.\n\nAs a production assistant, my job is to do whatever it takes to make the shoot happen. Also, whatever crazy task has been assigned to me by anyone, including the models. My particular task at the moment, was to guard the cat while the supermodels were getting butt-naked in the back and changing into various sexy things for the shoot.\n\nI honestly never peeked. Fucking NEVER peeked. EVER. That's one of the reasons they loved me. I took my shit seriously. \n\nSo, there I was guarding the cat, then make-up called me over to help brush an extension for the shoot. Yeah, I brushed a wig, happily. Don't judge, you would've done it too. \n\nI stepped away from the back door of the cat for like 3 minutes. Then returned to stand cross armed like a boss. During this 3 minute hiatus from my post, one of the make-up girls (biggest cunt I've ever met) opened the door to the cat, got in, fixed some shit, and got out. Well, she forgot to latch the door properly and the cat was sitting on a slope.\n\nAs she was walking away, and before I had returned to my post, the back door to the cat, using the all-mighty power of gravity, swung open due to her failing to latch it. \n\nTwo things happened at that moment, \n1)The door swung open, reveling  a completely topless Vanessa Lorenzo. (My jaw nearly detached)\n2)The door continued to swing on it's arc and satisfyingly thudded DIRECTLY INTO THE FUCKING CUNT'S HEAD that had forgot to latch it. It dropped her like a sack of shit that she was. That door weighed probably close to 50 lbs. It would have dropped anyone had it hit them as perfectly as it hit her.\n\nI now sat at a juncture. Vanessa Lorenzo topless in front of me, COMPLETELY unapologetic, and cunt-stain unconscious in the snow.\n\nAs a pro, I winked at the model, (at least that's how it went down in my head) then administered concussion response to the unconscious hag. Who, upon revival, threatened to sue me for not taking her down the mountain for medical treatment. \n\nBy the way, this was the same day I gave the snowboard lesson to Alessandra and this part of the story is one more reason this is day #3 in my best of all time.\n\n**TL;DR\nOld rus**ty cat door swung open, Model inside was topless. door continues to administer sweet sweet justice.", "id": "cz05l6x"}, {"comment": "Holy crap man I love your stories!", "id": "cz0cv8g"}, {"comment": "Thanks!

The reason for darker coloration, like a 5 o'clock shadow on a mans jawline is the result of part of the hair being left behind. If you don't leave anything behind, you don't get any darkening. Additionally, people with fine body hair don't have the same issues with that sort of darkening.\n\nAlso, there's people who naturally have less hair than others. Hell, I personally know a male model whose hair is so fine, and so spare that his eyebrows are damn near invisible.

Yes having great genes certainly helps alot, but the diets and workout routines needed to maintain that level of attractiveness are no fucking joke.\n\nAnd modelling is not just sitting down and taking pictures either. There are millions of good looking girls around the world. Not all of them are models(and even those who are models aren't anywhere as successful as Miranda Kerr) and let me tell you, that isn't due to lack of ambition. Looking attractive and sexy 24/7 in this age of social media etc is difficult to say the least. You can't make it on looks alone. Just look at the picture above. Look at Miranda Kerr's pose, body posture and facial expression. It takes a lot of work and practice to achieve that and maintain it. You should visit a photoshoot where a model is strutting her stuff.

It's abuse of the system by bots and/or some sort of shitty \"paid likes\" system. I'm not sure.\n\nIt might be to get accounts to the minimum required level to bypass new account restrictions.\n\nReddit is now a common place for people and companies to push their agenda or propaganda so Reddit accounts, upvotes and exposure are becoming valuable commodities.\n\nI've had 4-5 competitors to Reddit contact me directly to offer to pay me to \"get things to the front page\" or \"make posts successful in reactiongifs\" and similar things. All because I have a moderate amount of karma. Someone even asked how much to buy my account.\n\nAnd I'm just a normal guy who occasionally posts to Reddit. Think about all the users with even more karma who carpet bomb Reddit all day every day with posts and comments. They have probably had the same sort of offers or better and may even have agreed to them.\n\nTo entertain an example: Take *EditingAndLayout*, who has Reddit \"celebrity status\" and has been posting wrestling gifs so much that it became a \"thing\" and even /r/reactiongifs became wrestling-themed for April Fool's Day. It would have been very easy for WWE to contact him and say, \"we'll pay you to promote WWE wrestling gifs\" - and they know he will get upvoted to the front page every day without fail. That is huge exposure, amounting to millions of views, and probably for a very low cost compared to traditional advertising methods. Bam, wrestling becomes even more of a meme, it's cool and ironic to love wrestling, and suddenly loads of people are showing either new or renewed interest in wrestling.\n\nI'm not saying at all that this particular example is a true story, just saying it would be very easy for a company to do, and that there is a huge amount of promotion going on within Reddit - either openly (think \"thanks Reddit, you made our hot sauce company successful!\" type posts, where everyone congratulates themselves for being part of the club and upvotes them to the front page along with a raft of \"I love this hot sauce, it's my favourite\" type comments) or subtly and secretively (political agendas, companies sneakily trying to promote their products or improve their brand image).", "id": "d1nzzgh"}, {"comment": "Sounds like we need a purge", "id": "d1o0qwy"}, {"comment": "Execute Order 66.", "id": "d1o0v6s"}, {"comment": "*EX-E-CUTE ORD-AH SIXS-TEE-SIXS!*", "id": "d1o1n90"}, {"comment": "DO EET!", "id": "d1o7ym0"}, {"comment": "Something something something Dark side\n\nSomething something something complete ", "id": "d1o1uqk"}, {"comment": "Has it come to this?", "id": "d1o0wcy"}, {"comment": "Original Pirate Material", "id": "d1o4lof"}, {"comment": "Lock down your aerial", "id": "d1o9344"}, {"comment": "Common sense, simple common sense.", "id": "d1otw3m"}, {"comment": "This is probably the most well-thought answer regarding the recent obvious shilling on the site.

The racist part is the fact that her entire character isn't based on Japanese culture at all. Her entire character is based off of the author's *perception* of Japanese culture. She's a walking stereotype of the only Japanese things the author could think of. \n\nKatana was created by two American authors who have no connection to Japanese culture at all.

Stop forcing yourself to be offended. Take a step back and laugh at something or enjoy it for what it is.

I feel offended by her character, period. I did not wake up this morning and say to myself, \"I want to go find some thing to be offended by\". I think this argument might proceed more smoothly if I explained *why* I feel offended by this character.\n\nI linked just TWO examples, out of hundreds, of how Asians are negatively portrayed in media: [Mr. Yunioshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._Y._Yunioshi) and [Fu Manchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fu_Manchu). (Ignore the fact that they were played by white people, that's an entirely separate but still important argument.) Mr. Yunioshi is an angry and bucktoothed nerd with a horrible Asian accent. Fu Manchu is a evil criminal genius who perpetuated the stereotype associated with the [Yellow Peril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Peril) (where Chinese people were demonized and seen as backwards rats who would come and steal your women.) These two characters are complete bastardizations of Chinese culture. You're right, I don't know whether or not the creators of Mr. Yunioshi or Fu Manchu had any personal connection with Asian cultures, but as someone who is Chinese, I do know that they did not portray these cultures with any respect at all. I'm glad you have a connection with Lao culture but these stereotypes pushed forth by media may be the first and only connection that the greater American audience has with Asian cultures. It's damaging to American perspectives of who Asian people are because all they see are either nerdy computer geniuses who lack any social capabilities, or a old wise bearded kung-fu master. \n\nSo how does all this relate to Katana? These backward portrayals of Asians in media still continue to this day. Katana takes stereotypes of Asian cultures (mysticism, magic, martial arts, family) and boils it down into an unrealistic representation of the culture that's devoid of any of the historical and cultural significance of the symbols it takes. So when little Jimmy is reading Suicide Squad for the first time, he might think to himself, \"Wow Japanese people are so mysterious, they fight for their families using magic and swords and stuff\". You might say that this isn't dangerous or offensive at all, but let me ask you this.

There are countless portrayals of my culture being backwards stupid sister-fucking hicks with a closed mind and a penchant for Jesus but I have never been offended by any of them despite me not being anything like that. \n\nThe world needs to learn to stop being so offended all the time. \n\nI would ask that you think back to my question about the Viking hero and no im not talking about Thor, this is hypothetical. The avengers sucked. If you are willing to stand up and say that that character is not offensive while white-nighting for Katana then you are objectively wrong. The character I mentioned is just as much a stereotype but since it applies specifically to white people, it's okay. That is, in an of itself, racist.

Crew was nice, cast also. Thought she was nice to us extras. ", "id": "d2jdhw4"}, {"comment": "How was the food on set?", "id": "d2khiwf"}, {"comment": "Here's what my typical day looked like:\n\n7am Call time ; craft service (the stage food service guy) would have breakfast set up for the cast and crew and background (extras). Think continental breakfast at a hotel.\nHot cakes, sausages, eggs, breakfast burritos, bacon, oatmeal and donuts.\nCast and crew goes first then the extras.\nShooting starts promptly after that.\n\n11 am : Party tray of sandwiches; variety of bread and meats, bags of potato chips. Fresh fruit, grapes and fresh watermelon slices.\n\n12 pm : fresh baked cookies and cake.\n\n1pm LUNCH catered ; variety of chicken, fish, or steak, full compliments of salad bar and dessert table, usually fresh baked cookies and ice cream or pies. Grilled steaks included, prime rib, NY steak, pork tender loins. The fish was usually grilled, salmon, swordfish or Ahi Tuna. Spare ribs in sweet bbq sauce with corn bread and Mac and cheese. My favorite will always be the time the catered guys served Chicken Cordon bleu. MY GOD I've never tasted anything so good! I'm a guy from the mean streets of Compton, what do I know about chicken cordon bleu? \n\nAnd that's the most impressive part of lunch,  I never took the food for granted. Be it taco bar, make your own tacos or fajitas, or prime steak and salmon, I knew how expensive this would cost in the real world. A typical meal like this would cost no less than $25-$45, per person.\n(See my rant on show producers below).\n\n4 pm food truck or Ice coffee food truck outside the stages. Mexican / Korean fusion tacos were good. Wasn't a fan at first then I grew to love cabbage on my tacos. On hot days the blended ice coffee drinks we're the best. Not that it mattered, we spent the ENTIRE day within the stage. It was usual freezing in there anyway.\n\n6 pm: Fried chicken or bbq mini sliders with French fries. I loved these because it was so close to the end of the day and I would end up taking a lot of these home with me. Ha! \n\nI'm failing to mention the most critical part, an entire day of being tempted to eat from the craft service table. Think of a typical snack table at a picnic loaded with candy, chips, sodas, fruit and veggies, nuts, coffee, DONUTS! (the never ending donuts), cheese and meat plate, ect ect.\n \nAnyway, it was a good ride but I shit you not, I gained so much weight. I lost it all after I stopped working the show. I work on a military show now and the food is good but I don't work it as often as I did L&M which was everyday for a year! I miss it sometimes. \n\nOn the producers and budget. Now, this being a Disney show I'm going to give most, if not all the credit, to the producers of the show for providing so much to cast and crew. They decide how much of that budget gets extended to the extras. I've worked on some million dollar budget shows where it was apparent we would not get the best food. But even then I would tell myself well at least they are feeding us, what job does that anyway? Maybe today wasn't the best food but tomorrow I'll work on a film or tv shows that will.\n\n But the L&M producers treated everyone the same, cast and crew alike, (well they did while I was there. Haven't worked the show in a year). That's very telling of them. They could have been misers and set up separate food tables and lunch tables the way most shows do at times. Anyway like I said, they made me feel at home and it was a great experience.\n\nI was grateful for my time there.\n\nThanks for the question.\n\n(Edit) spelling.

There is no sanity clause!

For example, a character who died in the movie doesn't die in the series and so on. They also tie the entire thing from early in the beginning to the Mayan mythology of Xibalba (the Mayan Underworld) and draw aspects of lore and whatnot from there.\n\nIt's like, the movie was a crazy ride from being a movie about two bankrobbers on the run from the police to two bankrobbers and a few civilians accidentally in the middle of a vampire bloodfeast where the lore was at best only mentioned as a side note.
