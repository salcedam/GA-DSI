Now don't get me wrong, I'm white and I am not going to go around telling black people what they should be offended by, but the \"Zwarte Piet is racist because he's a slave!\" argument is flawed. The entire mythos of Saint Nicholas revolves around his good deeds, one of which being him freeing slave children and then employing them as a benevolent employer. The message is a good one, not a pro-slavery one. Furthermore changing the tradition would be the same as pretending slavery never happened. I would argue that erasing all mention of the atrocities committed in the past is more damaging than respectfully maintaining traditions (and art, literature, whatever) containing references to these atrocities so that we may remember what happened. Zwarte Piet isn't making fun of slavery or pretending it was a non-issue, it is reminding people of the past and telling a story of a figure who is revered by the people of our country. Now, you might say that the fact that white people paint their face and don stereotypical wigs and lipstick is offensive and I wouldn't disagree, but the character Zwarte Piet in and of itself is not a racist one in my opinion.

In the case of athleticism specifically, [there are some tenuous arguments for the case of ethnic superiority](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/82889a98-e1c4-11d8-8dda-00000e2511c8.html), but the importance of that point is kinda moot as everyone in the world continues to mix races.

And I would personally attest to that based on a good amount of anecdotal experience in social work. Pieces of shit come in every color of the rainbow.\n\nI agree that the topic warrants discussion and study purely from a scientific standpoint.

Classes 1-3.\n\nClass 1: BMI of 30 to < 35\n\nClass 2: BMI of 35 to < 40\n\nClass 3: BMI of 40 or higher. Class 3 obesity is sometimes categorized as \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201csevere\u201d obesity.\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI) considers a persons weight in kg divided by their height in meters squared. However, this needs to be taken lightly because not all bodies are the same and each individual has different body composition of fat, muscles, and water percentages.\n\nHere is your list of body mass indices as provided by the CDC:\n\nIf your BMI is less than 18.5, it falls within the underweight range.\n\nIf your BMI is 18.5 to <25, it falls within the normal.\n\nIf your BMI is 25.0 to <30, it falls within the overweight range.\n\nIf your BMI is 30.0 or higher, it falls within the obese range.\n\nNow I say obesity also isn't someone who is really overweight because you can have a very muscular individual who may be shorter than your average person who has a BMI > 30, thus indicating him or her obese. If you want a true indication of your BMI, you should see a healthcare professional who has tools and equipment to correctly determine you BMI based on your individual body.  \n\n[Source](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult/defining.html)\n\n", "id": "d614isr"}, {"comment": "> Redditors think that if you sit around on a computer and play minecraft all day, but you have a fast metabolism and remain skinny, that this is the definition of being healthy.\n\nJust making stuff up.

Suddenly, I saw my buddies had all stopped and I had gotten a bit behind, so I was driving pretty fast to catch up. I pulled the hand break and felt my snowmobile skidding left and tipping over, throwing me forward in the process. Before stalling it went a full turn to upside down and then back to the right way again and at one point I was lying on my back on the snow with the snowmobile on top of me.

The snowmobile started right up and I drove much more carefully after that. I don't know if I was close to injuring myself, but it certainly felt dangerous.

That will create a trough behind the wave where the engine bay is where the water level can be 6\" or more lower than the true depth. Too fast and you push through the wave putting the high water mark right where you don't want it, too slow and you don't get the bow wave benefit.

We'd often go (drunk) to the lighthouse at the end of the pier in the the town where i live. Especially when it was storming.

We were hiding behind the lighthouse, drinking beer on one of the concrete benches that were around the lighthouse and enjoying the show of seeing all these waves crash onto the pier and rising well above the boardwalk in relative safety. Idiots that we were, we decided that we should take turns running to the front of of the lighthouse in between waves to see who would last the longest out there before running back to safety behind the lighthouse.....so this went on and on for a while, us challenging eachother to go further and further, circling the lighthouse, standing still in front of the lighthouse, etc. After a while my buddy and i went together just as the biggest wave of the night was coming at us (unbeknownst to us at the time). So we stood there and this wave crashes onto the pier and starts to rise above us. We  scream at this huge wave that was almost reaching top of the lighthouse height, we do a semi scooby doo hug and manage to haul ass just before it crashes down onto the pier. So we stand there in safety and one of the concrete benches actually comes drifting by.

Witnesses had reported seeing three teenagers knocked off their feet on the north pier by the unforgiving storm and its relentless waves. It wasn't clear whether the boys had been tossed into the canal, swept into the lake, or whether, maybe, they were still on the pier and in trouble.\n\nThe boys, like many others that night, had been drawn by the storm, mesmerized by it, the way we always are when Lake Superior decides to bare its teeth. But they had forgotten, apparently -- as it's easy to do -- that the big lake, \"to which we owe so much,\" as the News Tribune would opine four days later, \"is capable of a frightful blow.\"\n\nLeaning into the wind on the north pier, the boys made their way to the elevated lighthouse at the end. Climb a few steps. Get above the waves, which were estimated that night as high as 20 feet. Two of them made it, but when they looked back, the third was clutching desperately to a light pole.\n\nAnother wave rolled across the cement, \"the biggest wave I had seen for several minutes,\" as wave-watcher Donald Gruening described the scene in the next day's paper.\n\nThe waves were coming fast, said another witness, Elaine A. Buehring of Piedmont Avenue. She described a blur -- and then nothing but empty light poles along the pier.\n\nThe boys who had made it to the lighthouse immediately raced back to help the other. That's when they, too, were knocked off their feet by the pounding of the icy lake water.\n\nThe Coast Guardsmen -- Boatswain Mate First Class Edgar A. Culbertson, 32, of Ferndale, Mich.; Boatswain Mate Third Class Richard R. Callahan, 21, of Chicago; and Fireman Ronald C. Prel, 21, of Francis, Wis. -- left about 25 feet of rope between them. Their thinking was that if a wave knocked one of them from the pier, the other two could pull him back to safety.\n\nThe men shuffled their way to the lighthouse without incident, but also without finding any sign of the missing boys.\n\nOn their way back, a particularly nasty wave struck Culbertson, lifting him off the pier and dumping him into the lake below. His fellow guardsmen weren't able to pull him back up, as they had hoped. The force of the huge wave, the strength of the wind and the weight of a falling, soaking-wet Culbertson nearly ripped their arms off. Callahan suffered a severe broken wrist as the safety line gave way. All he and Prel could do was fight through the storm to reach the beach below. That was where they'd find Culbertson's body.\n\nDuluth Police cleared the area of storm-gazers and the parking lot next to the ship canal of vehicles. One car remained. Its license plate led to the identities of the three lost boys.\n\nThey were brothers from Chester Park who had stopped at Canal Park after a church activity at First United Methodist, \"the copper-top church\" on Skyline Parkway. Eric Halverson, 17, was a senior at East High School and was president of his church's University of Life youth group. His twin brothers, Arthur Halverson and Nathan Halverson, 16, were juniors at East. The boys -- young men, really -- had two older brothers away at Macalester College in St. Paul and two younger sisters, ages 14 and 10. Their father was a lawyer.\n\nTheir mother has spoken little in public about that night. \"Forty years is a long time ago. Of course, we were horribly shocked,\" Betty Halverson said this week. \"We lost our three boys, but we felt very badly, too, about the Coast Guardsman who volunteered to help and who lost his life.\"\n\nRetired Vista Fleet captain Tom Mackay always felt badly, too, about Culbertson, his good friend. He was \"a fun guy to be with, a very dedicated Coast Guardsman,\" Mackay said. They used to hang out together at the Sand Bar, now Grandma's, which was popular among the Coast Guard guys. Mackay got to know them so well he played for the Coast Guard's city-league hockey team.\n\nIn the 1980s, after a memorial to Culubertson was removed during a pier-widening project, Mackay helped to make sure the brass plaque wasn't forgotten. The sign is set on a concrete pedestal now, just outside the entrance to the marine museum. A couple of times a year, whenever the gull droppings get thick, Mackay grabs a bottle of cleanser and a scrub brush from his home on Park Point and spends a few moments cleaning off the marker.\n\nAt noon Monday, Mackay and a few ROMEO, or Retired Old Men Eating Out, buddies -- including a former Fraser Shipyards official and the former director of the Duluth-Superior port -- will gather at the memorial plaque. To remember. To honor.\n\n\"It's for anyone who shows up, so they can kind of show their respect,\" Mackay said. \"If anyone wants to say anything, they sure can.\"\n\nAfter that tragic night, donations were collected by the Duluth Police for Culbertson's family. He had two children, ages 9 and 6, living in Michigan then with their mother. Money also was gathered by First United Methodist Church to build a \"Three Brothers Chapel,\" a small, quiet, wood-paneled room.\n\nA perfect place to remember, to honor. And to never forget: The beautiful big lake stretching to the horizon from Duluth's doorstep can be as dangerous as it is awesome.", "id": "dakidk3"}, {"comment": "Sorry that was more directed at the websites that do that than you, but I do appreciate you posting the text, thanks.

We were all at this out of state college. We all pitched in on an ounce of shooms and so we each had about 4 g's because it weighed over. 1 person, a dick, we'll call him Andy, because that's his bitch ass real name, never came home so one of his roommates put his eighth in his room (nightstand I learned in hindsight).\n\nOne guy had never taken anything but aspirin and some weed so I was trying to keep him chill. He had no chill. Things ended up turning bad and he went hulk, bitch slapped me, then ran out of the apartment and apparently starting hitting cars and yelling he was going to kill someone. The security guard called the cops and everyone but me and the only other girl stayed inside. \n\nWe stayed in the backroom and I kept asking her where the drugs were because I knew the cops were going to come. She couldn't comprehend English she was so fucked up. Within a few minutes I hear \"if there's anyone else in this apartment you need to come out now with your hands up\" so I had to announce I was back there with a friend that I had to carry out because she couldn't walk. I didn't want to get shot.\n\nCops search and found a half a pound of pot, 36 pieces of paraphernalia, and the eighth of shrooms. \n\nI ended up having 30+ charges dropped because the person whose girlfriend I carried out let the cops know it was his weed and paraphernalia and we were unknowing guests in his house. Thanks bro, he was my weed man, and I had definitely tried to hide his drugs. But I didn't have anything on me that night.\n\nBut here comes bitch ass Andy, my cousin, at that. He had stayed at his mom's house and never came back to the state we were in. Once he got back to town he got arrested. He wrote a fucking novel longer than a mofo. He gave up the big fish, how they met, routes taken to get to his house and what days certain people went. He gave his address and phone number then told where we got the shrooms from and how we had done this multiple times. All the while insisting that he had nothing to do with anything, he just introduced the big fish to the little fish. He also threw in who bought stuff in the town we went to college in for some reason. Pretty much anything the cops wanted, Andy gave them.\n\nSoooo, now this brings us to federal charges because we were buying drugs in one state and bringing them across state lines to where we went to college. They tried really hard to get us on federal charges but once the big fish caught wind that we had been arrested he packed everything and moved to another state. Since they were unable to find him they couldn't get us on federal charges. \n\nThe best part is I was a criminal justice major and a cop who also taught classes at the college I went to was the one who arrested me. He was cool after everything. Let me collect my belongings that were scattered around the apartment and then stopped at my car to get my card so I could bail myself out. He explained I probably wouldn't be able to afford it and I'd have to see a judge first for such serious offenses. It was a real trip I tell you, trippin in jail.\n\nAndy got off with a slap on the wrist. If they would have been my shrooms I wouldn't have let my friends take that fall. And since Andy is my cousin he told his mom a completely different story than the truth. He never called her from jail either, he sat in there for a week before his roommate, the one who took the fall for the weed, bailed him out. My family believed him since he didn't get in trouble and we all got in trouble. Apparently they don't know snitches get off easy. \n\nEdit: that's long af. TL;DR: The cops found weed and mushrooms and wanted to charge us with federal crimes. I didn't actually have any drugs since I had eaten mine.

Every night we were going out to nice restaurants with vodka being served constantly (and if you aren't aware Russians do Vodka right I had never had it served chilled before). \n\nThe last day there we had what can only be considered to be one of the worst meetings in the history of meetings. Two weeks ... Down the drain. Everyone disagreeing, yelling, someone may have been called a jackass, someone else may or may not have been told to fuck off. You know normal meeting stuff. So ... Meeting ends and the the finance guy I was just having this knock down drag out fight with looks at me and was like \"that was good, you want a drink?\". Fuuck yes .. Where we going. He walks over to his cabinet and opens up very well appointed bar. You know what, I'm an auditor, that's against policy ... I'm not even worried hand me the vodka.\n\nSo I have a bottle of vodka, he has a bottle of scotch and two female coworkers are drinking a nice merlot. When the vodka bottle was 3/4 empty and he was about 4 scotches in he pulls up his computer and shows me a slide show he made of his last vacation complete with music ... Holy shit that's Hotel California ... We start singing the Eagles ... Probably the best rendition ever done. \n\nI finish the vodka and he pours me a scotch. That was probably a bad idea \"Hey u/bigaggie06 you lol kinda green do you need some water\" yeah wrong move water goes down and starts to head right back up so off I am running down the office hall (thankfully well after hours by now) to vomit. Man I'm feeling much better, and does goes another scotch (mistake #2) ... Back to the restroom for some more vomiting.\n\nFinally we decide to pick it in, my coworker and I have an early flight to London then on to Houston so we head down to his car. Of course this is an old soviet era building so we have about a 5 minute wait for the elevator but not brave enough to try the stairs. The driver pulls up, they put me in the front seat and Gergori leans forward and says something in Russian to the driver. Off we go at about 2 miles an hour. After about a block I look back and ask Gregori if he had told the driver to go slow (he had) screw that you should probably get me to the hotel ASAP. So we pick up the pace, have to drop his coworker off at a subway station which is one block down from our hotel but across the street. Now if you've been to Moscow you know why this is an issue ... Traffic is a nightmare and to put us on the right side of the street would probably be another 30 minutes or ... We can get out and dart across dodging traffic like the old frogged game, against my buddy Gregori's wishes my coworker and I exit the vehicle and decide to chance crossing. Now we have 6 lanes of traffic whizzing by us .. But I must give the Russians credit (at least the Moscow variety YMMV) when they see a drunk American stumbling across the road with his terrified coworker behind him... They stop pretty quick (me being north of 300lbs may have helped they probably didn't want to hurt their cars)\n\nUp to the hotel, vomit, set the alarm on my phone for 4 hours from now, and I am out. Alarm goes off I spring out of bed and realize .. I didn't fucking pack yet. Throw my shit into the suitcase, vomit again, brush my teeth and rush downstairs right as our car is pulling up. Not feeling horrible so I chat with my coworker but then it hits me, and I supposedly turned a nice shade of green. Luckily I did not throw up in the car. We arrive and there is a line at check in, I'm going to throw up real fast. Walk into public restroom, all stalls are occupied. There's the flush and out walks an orthodox priest in I go into the stall .. Looking at what the priest left in the toilet magically cured me my sickness, thank you kind priest. \n\nSo we get checked in and my stomach is starting to churn again and there is another line for security, but A-HA, we are flying business class, separate line, no wait. Plus business lounge. Through security into the lounge, into the spotless just cleaned Business Class lounge ... This is my stall now, I own it. In the 45 minutes we have to wait for boarding I throw up 5 or 6 times. On the plane, pass out. Throw up a few times before we get to London. Into the London lounge, throw up. Get me some coffee with Bailey's (great for a hangover). Things didn't really settle down till somewhere over Greenland after 3 beers and numerous orange juices where in me. Landed in Houston feeling like shit but alive and slept for about 22 hours, my wife said it my worst snoring ever.\n\n\nTl;dr drank with Russians got rekt all the way to London and half way across the Atlantic Ocean."], [3, "So he isnt the machine?"], [3, "You gotta know your limits man"], [3, "I tried to search his instagram, but gave up almost instantly when I realised my keyboard lacks the backwards N and backwards R keys."], [3, "Ah, was good party.

He only succeeded in cutting his hand/arm all to shit. Other roommate let him in, he was still pissed apparently and stomped into the house, went into the bathroom and left blood/bloody handprints everywhere. Then went into his own room and just fucking *destroyed* shit. Took his chair, swung it around knocking stuff everywhere. Smashed a bunch of shit. Basically looked like a goddamned bloody tornado came through. It was fucking nuts! \n\nThe next day he was so embarrassed (and probably felt like hell to boot) that he wouldn't come out of his room or even respond to us.

Every night we were going out to nice restaurants with vodka being served constantly (and if you aren't aware Russians do Vodka right I had never had it served chilled before). \n\nThe last day there we had what can only be considered to be one of the worst meetings in the history of meetings. Two weeks ... Down the drain. Everyone disagreeing, yelling, someone may have been called a jackass, someone else may or may not have been told to fuck off. You know normal meeting stuff. So ... Meeting ends and the the finance guy I was just having this knock down drag out fight with looks at me and was like \"that was good, you want a drink?\". Fuuck yes .. Where we going. He walks over to his cabinet and opens up very well appointed bar. You know what, I'm an auditor, that's against policy ... I'm not even worried hand me the vodka.\n\nSo I have a bottle of vodka, he has a bottle of scotch and two female coworkers are drinking a nice merlot. When the vodka bottle was 3/4 empty and he was about 4 scotches in he pulls up his computer and shows me a slide show he made of his last vacation complete with music ... Holy shit that's Hotel California ... We start singing the Eagles ... Probably the best rendition ever done. \n\nI finish the vodka and he pours me a scotch. That was probably a bad idea \"Hey u/bigaggie06 you lol kinda green do you need some water\" yeah wrong move water goes down and starts to head right back up so off I am running down the office hall (thankfully well after hours by now) to vomit. Man I'm feeling much better, and does goes another scotch (mistake #2) ... Back to the restroom for some more vomiting.\n\nFinally we decide to pick it in, my coworker and I have an early flight to London then on to Houston so we head down to his car. Of course this is an old soviet era building so we have about a 5 minute wait for the elevator but not brave enough to try the stairs. The driver pulls up, they put me in the front seat and Gergori leans forward and says something in Russian to the driver. Off we go at about 2 miles an hour. After about a block I look back and ask Gregori if he had told the driver to go slow (he had) screw that you should probably get me to the hotel ASAP. So we pick up the pace, have to drop his coworker off at a subway station which is one block down from our hotel but across the street. Now if you've been to Moscow you know why this is an issue ... Traffic is a nightmare and to put us on the right side of the street would probably be another 30 minutes or ... We can get out and dart across dodging traffic like the old frogged game, against my buddy Gregori's wishes my coworker and I exit the vehicle and decide to chance crossing. Now we have 6 lanes of traffic whizzing by us .. But I must give the Russians credit (at least the Moscow variety YMMV) when they see a drunk American stumbling across the road with his terrified coworker behind him... They stop pretty quick (me being north of 300lbs may have helped they probably didn't want to hurt their cars)\n\nUp to the hotel, vomit, set the alarm on my phone for 4 hours from now, and I am out. Alarm goes off I spring out of bed and realize .. I didn't fucking pack yet. Throw my shit into the suitcase, vomit again, brush my teeth and rush downstairs right as our car is pulling up. Not feeling horrible so I chat with my coworker but then it hits me, and I supposedly turned a nice shade of green. Luckily I did not throw up in the car. We arrive and there is a line at check in, I'm going to throw up real fast. Walk into public restroom, all stalls are occupied. There's the flush and out walks an orthodox priest in I go into the stall .. Looking at what the priest left in the toilet magically cured me my sickness, thank you kind priest. \n\nSo we get checked in and my stomach is starting to churn again and there is another line for security, but A-HA, we are flying business class, separate line, no wait. Plus business lounge. Through security into the lounge, into the spotless just cleaned Business Class lounge ... This is my stall now, I own it. In the 45 minutes we have to wait for boarding I throw up 5 or 6 times. On the plane, pass out. Throw up a few times before we get to London. Into the London lounge, throw up. Get me some coffee with Bailey's (great for a hangover). Things didn't really settle down till somewhere over Greenland after 3 beers and numerous orange juices where in me. Landed in Houston feeling like shit but alive and slept for about 22 hours, my wife said it my worst snoring ever.\n\n\nTl;dr drank with Russians got rekt all the way to London and half way across the Atlantic Ocean.", "id": "d3pu2uc"}], [{"comment": "So he isnt the machine?", "id": "d3p0fpl"}], [{"comment": "You gotta know your limits man", "id": "d3p1jbg"}, {"comment": "Or just don't play the \"let's see who can get closer to the lethal dose of alcohol without actually dying\" game.", "id": "d3p5gy8"}, {"comment": "Your body knows its limits better than you", "id": "d3p47pu"}], [{"comment": "I tried to search his instagram, but gave up almost instantly when I realised my keyboard lacks the backwards N and backwards R keys.", "id": "d3p59j2"}, {"comment": "You didn't try just typing it in Google?\n\nhttp://www.memrise.com/mem/2493660/mhe-he-hpabntcr/", "id": "d3p6q5u"}, {"comment": "nope I gave up instantly", "id": "d3pq7wf"}], [{"comment": "Ah, was good party.

So it's reasonable to say that 1 in every 16,743,119,266 vending machine uses results in death (that is, 365*100000000/2.18).\n\nThe other half of this equation is a bit trickier, since it's largely location-dependent. I'm going to use \"US beaches\". This is also going to require some assumptions. Apparently, [~58 million people](https://www.quora.com/How-many-people-go-to-the-beach-in-the-US-each-year) visit the beach each year. I'm going to assume that the average number of beach trips per year per person is very close to 1. Let's be generous and say it's 1.25. That's 72,500,000 beach usages per year. I'm going to be more generous and assume that every person who went to the beach actually entered the ocean. So that's 72,500,000 ocean uses per year. Meanwhile, there are [0.5 deadly shark attacks per year](http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/isaf/what-are-odds/risks-comparison/lightning-strikes). So that means that 1 in every 145,000,000 ocean uses results in death by shark.\n\nIn conclusion, when considering danger, it's important to consider the preconditions for the death to occur in the first place. Way more people freeze to death than get attacked by sharks but if I live in a tropical region, I'm not all that likely to freeze to death. The chance of dying from a vending machine (provided you're actually using a vending machine) is 0.000000005% meanwhile the chance of dying from a shark (provided you're actually using the ocean) is 0.0000007%.\n\nedit: I had an afterthought about all this. What we actually want is not \"deaths per use\" but rather \"deaths per minute of usage\". If we assume it takes about 1 minute to use a vending machine and that the average swim in the ocean lasts about 60 minutes, our vending machine number would stay the same but the shark attack number would decrease to 0.000000012% per minute of ocean usage (compared with 0.000000005% per minute of vending machine usage).", "id": "d42qc0d"}, {"comment": "Nice breakdown.

For eg, im a surfer and at the moment I would not go anywhere near a place called Balina in Nsw Australia because the risk of getting attacked is very high relative to many other areas (due to there being a large amount of shark attacks in Balina recently) \n\nto sum it up its as stupid as people saying a similiar 'fact'. \"your more likely to get hit on the head by a coconut and die than get struck by lightning\".

Ideally, you'd sample all swimming events on beaches where shark attacks have been recorded and weight the data by the number of swims from that beach against the chance of being attacked in the water off that beach.\n\nOr even go further and get an estimate for the number of shark sightings from a beach that subsequently have an attack so you can weight the probability of being attacked when swimming by the number of sightings to attacks ratio. So beaches that have lots of sightings but few attacks will give a lower statistical probability of being attacked than a beach with little or no sightings but a similar number of attacks. (I.e. Beach where the water is cleared quickly in the event of a shark sighting vs beach where no the sharks come in stealthily so people don't have chance to evacuate the water vs a beach where the shark is sighted but the swimmers are not warned).", "id": "d43rm5r"}, {"comment": "That's what the sharks want you to believe.", "id": "d42v2ds"}, {"comment": "[Fair enough.](http://previews.123rf.com/images/danomyte/danomyte1101/danomyte110100003/8544303-Business-Shark-Stock-Vector-shark-cartoon-fish.jpg)", "id": "d42v8at"}, {"comment": "Well, *I* have about a 0% chance of this happening.

And, yet, you're right. The impact he's had has been incredible.\n\nThe weird skateboards he rode back then look like the boards everyone rides today. The weird tricks he was doing are now the standard catalog of street tricks for every skater worth watching.

", "id": "d2xh9a8"}, {"comment": "First, you have to bear in mind that murder requires two things: the ACT and an INTENT to commit the act.  Remember that as you read below.\n\nDefinition of murder/manslaughter has a number of steps (a checklist, if you will), and varies from country to country.  In a nutshell, manslaughter is when you kill someone while breaking the law, but didnt **intend** to kill or hurt anyone.  The act is half the crime, the intent is the other half.\n\ne.g. speeding and you run someone over: manslaughter, not murder.\n\ne.g. 2: Driving legally and you run someone over (and say, it was the deceased's fault) -no issue, the driver may even be able to sue the dead person's family for negligence causing distress!)\n\nNow, for murder theres the whole killing someone outright, which is obvious.  But killing someone while committing certain crimes results is also \"murder\".  e.g. assault/battery.\n\nSo, to provide a similar example to the gif, but far more intuitive:\n\nYou point a gun at someone, you have no *intent* to kill them - maybe you were sure the gun was unloaded (and you can prove it 100% in court), but the gun accidentally goes off and they die.  *Technically* you didnt intend to kill them, so it would be \"non-culpable homicide\" i.e. you killed them but no punishment.  Just like the example above where the person ran out in front of the car.\n\nHowever, the law finds the gun wielder guilty for murder *despite lack of intent* because they were committing one of the specified crimes at the time. (Pointing a gun at someone = assault, btw)\n\nBringing it back to the \"surfer\" in this GIF:\n\nHe is guilty of battery against the unconscious guy, if he should die as a direct enough cause of that action, even though he clearly didn't INTEND to kill anyone, he will be just as guilty of murder as someone who accidentally shoots someone.\n\n\n(This all may help people understand the Oscar Pistorious case a bit better too?)\n\nNote: I just remembered Americans have *degrees* of murder.  So some of this may not be as specific as can be.  To that I say: \"I'm sorry, but I don't have time to learn American law for a Reddit post. But what I said is true for UK, much of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, probably a tonne more countries, likely canada, and heck maybe even still perfectly accurate for America\"", "id": "d2xj4mm"}], [{"comment": "Fuck that guy.

They push downwards and then basically unload most of their weight from the springs for a fraction of a second, so it's only pushing their legs back up.\n\n**E:** I think actually, I've seen videos where this isn't quite the case - sometimes it is just that the two helpers are much heavier than the jumper, (e.g. a lot of the times I've seen it, it's with two teens and a kid or so), so although the helpers do get launched into the air a small amount, the kid gets launched sky high. \n\nThe total force exerted on the springs is 2.5 Mgh (where M is the weight of the helpers, and the jumper weighs e.g. half their weight), but it's distributed *evenly* between each person, so they each receive 0.83 of the force that one helper-sized person usually receives from the trampoline - which is 33% *more* than the kid usually receives.\n\nEven if the kid is standing still, and the helpers jump into the middle, if the kid is half their weight he will suddenly be launched with 17% more force than he would normally be able to bounce - which could still be pretty significant seeing as initial velocity is proportional to height *squared*...\n\nI might be wrong in my maths/assumptions, though... It's been a while.\n", "id": "d6pt8qk"}, {"comment": "I see only one correction. The jumper receives a 33% boost... IF his ORIGINAL jump was 100%. HOWEVER, his original is 50%. Therefore, 50% plus 33% is a bit closer to 55% increase, or, the jumper is sent 1.5 times as high as he normally would. However, this poses another problem. It might be the camera angle, but this kid clearly putts a wide gap between himself and the top of the safety net. If it's similar to the trampoline I used as a kid, the net is already 8 feet high. Considering he gets high enough to land his doubled-over body on it, hes closer to 10 or 11 feet from the top of the trampoline. If he gets launched 1.5x, his original jump would have to be 7 feet from the surface.

The jumper only weighs half as much, so only puts in half as much energy into each bounce, but that still takes him up to the same height as it would regardless of what he weighed...

I personally don't remember ever hitting that kinda height without double bouncing, but maybe that's just me.\n\nHis own jump height doesn't really depend on the height of his own previous jump - it depends much more on his helpers' jumps (if they are much heavier than he is). \n\nIn the gif though... the helpers seem *smaller* than the jumper, and barely jump at all... but they do definitely let their knees buckle, which is by far the more efficient tactic seeing as almost *all* of the energy from their own bounces gets transferred into the jumper's, instead of having to share out the energy between the three of them. \n", "id": "d6pzsg2"}, {"comment": "The 2 helpers jump up when the 3rd person lands so he extends the trampoline down further than he normaly could and is launched up before the 2 helps hit the trampoline it takes perfect timing with 1 person helping 2 almost takes luck to get perfect.

Sure,  someone who does neither may not care or even know the difference,  but it's kinda embarrassing if you actually practice the sport and still call it by the wrong name.  \n\nFor those who don't know,  Parkour is a martial art centered on efficiently overcoming obstacles.  Flipping and spinning is not part of it.  Free running is a more recent sport that adds tumbling/gymnastics/acrobatics to parkour, and focuses on style rather than efficiency.  \n\nEdit: Some people call freerunning \"tricking\",  but I think that's mostly people who don't know it is called freerunning.

And when the teacher approached to ask what was going on he said that we was just playing darts and this accident happened. Alex confirmed it and the teacher believed them. He was always getting away like that. Both of them was a fine team - Victor had a talent convincing people that they owed him money, and if someone had problems with Victor, they had to deal with Alex first. With that money he was buying beer, cigarettes and drugs sharing it all with Alex. Now Victor is in prison for stealing and drugs.
