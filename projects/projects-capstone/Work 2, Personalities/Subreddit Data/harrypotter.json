In LOTR there was a specific prophecy that said the Witch King could be not be killed by the hand of man.  So he was killed by a woman and a hobbit.  The Witch King was serious in his statement and the woman was serious that she was an exception.  From TV Tropes:\n\n>In The Lord of the Rings, the Witch-King of Angmar is the subject of a prophecy made by the Elf-lord Glorfindel, who foretold that he would not fall by the hand of man; naturally, he was slain by \u00c9owyn, a woman who entered the battle in disguise, with the aid of Merry, a hobbit. This was intentionally based on Macbeth, whose prophecy Tolkien thought was cheating; the Ents (actual walking trees) came from the same idea. Note how nicely Tolkien covers his bases here: \u00c9owyn is a member of the race called Men, but is female, while Merry is a man of his own race but is a Hobbit, not a Man. And killing the Witch-King takes both of them. In old English, as in many Germanic languages, \"man\" was a cross-gender word originally. The entire scene can be considered a pun on the human female: Woman, derived from wif-man (literally wife-man, but more accurately translated as \"woman-person\"). Thus, one Norwegian translation uses the archaic expression \"Kvinnmann\", (\"female man\") which literally means the same thing. \n\nhttp://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn", "id": "dapfvoi"}, {"comment": "It's also a slight allusion to Macbeth where he was prophesied to not be killed by someone \"born of a woman\" but he ended up getting murdered by a guy who was \"from his mother's womb untimely ripped.\" (C-Section) ", "id": "dapgkui"}, {"comment": "I mean...

Anything,\u201d said the wandmaker weakly.  \n\u201cCan you mend this? Is it possible?\u201d  \nOllivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected halves into his palm.  \n\u201cHolly and phoenix feather,\u201d said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. \u201cEleven inches. Nice and supple.\u201d  \n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCan you \u2014 ?\u201d  \n\u201cNo,\u201d whispered Ollivander. \u201cI am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.\u201d  \nHarry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the Malfoys\u2019.  \n\u201cCan you identify these?\u201d Harry asked.  \nThe wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly.  \n\u201cWalnut and dragon heartstring,\u201d he said. \u201cTwelve-and-three-quarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.\u201d  \n\u201cAnd this one?\u201d  \nOllivander performed the same examination.  \n\u201cHawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.\u201d  \n\u201cWas?\u201d repeated Harry. \u201cIsn\u2019t it still his?\u201d  \n\u201cPerhaps not.

In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.\u201d  \nThere was silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea.  \n\u201cYou talk about wands like they\u2019ve got feelings,\u201d said Harry, \u201clike they can think for themselves.\u201d  \n\u201cThe wand chooses the wizard,\u201d said Ollivander. \u201cThat much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.\u201d  \n\u201cA person can still use a wand that hasn\u2019t chosen them, though?\u201d asked Harry.  \n*\u201cOh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.\u201d\nThe sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound.*  \n\u201cI took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,\u201d said Harry. \u201cCan I use it safely?\u201d  \n\u201cI think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.\u201d  \n\u201cSo I should use this one?\u201d said Ron, pulling Wormtail\u2019s wand out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander.    \n\u201cChestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bidding, and do it well, than another wand.\u201d  \n\u201cAnd this holds true for all wands, does it?\u201d asked Harry  .  \n\u201cI think so,\u201d replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry\u2019s face. \u201cYou ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.\u201d  \n\u201cSo, it isn\u2019t necessary to kill the previous owner to take true possession of a wand?\u201d asked Harry.\nOllivander swallowed.  \n\u201cNecessary?

He idolized rock and metal stars and took a liking to the H. When his addiction got out of hand, he left his home country behind and joined a metal band instead. He plays fingerstyle bass, which explains the callouses on both hands. He also likes real dragons, and has actual friends who are dragon handlers, as seen in book 4, which is also why he decides to name the mansion that he buys for the money he earns touring \"Dragon Sanctuary\".\n\nCharlie Weasley still has a severe heroin problem today, and can't maintain a relationship.

Even when everyone is fighting, when Harry or Hermione throw up their hands and ignore him, it's Ron who's still glancing over his shoulder and watching over the others. It's Ron's family that gives all of them shelter and love. He's always standing against his fears and fighting all the subtle demotivators that threaten the other two. He gives the team reason and purpose to their struggles. He lives in a world somewhere between wizards and muggles (thanks to his father) and relates to both. Besides, Harry and Hermione obviously respect and value each other as friends, but Ron is the true link between them: he's Harry's BFF and Hermione's lover. Those bonds will never break, whereas friendships fade and change.\n\nPlus, look at how the horcruxes attack each member. With Harry, they make him weak, lethargic, or cause him physical pain. With Hermione, they shatter her concentration and make her lose focus, or try to make emotion drown her rationality. With Ron, it goes straight for the bonds between himself and the others - it attacks his love for both of them.\n\nI think that's how the 3rd wheeling comes in. Rarely are there situations that require full commitment from the group. Sometimes you just need to leap before looking and stride boldly towards the unknown (body + heart). Sometimes you need to stop fighting and care for the things that matter and reflect upon the state of the world (mind + heart).

Hermione was an insufferable know-it-all and no one liked her. She had no friends comforting her in the girls' bathroom at Halloween, two months after school started. She is a nice person but was never given the opportunity to show it until she took the fall for the troll situation. Nobody comes around to Hermione (except maybe Percy a bit) until after she's made friends with the dynamic duo.

If you read about alchemy in the historical sense, it was believed that creating a philosophers stone required mercury and sulphur, two competing, quarreling elements that needed to achieve balance before the perfect, red, gold-transmuting stone could be created. \n\nHarry is the philosophers stone of the series. Ron, the sulphur - red (literally red-haired), emotional, reactionary. Hermione, the mercury (her initials literally HG, the atomic symbol for mercury) - cool, intellectual. This is why Ron and Hermione quarrel so intensely in the books, and eventually fall in love, resolving this alchemical process and allowing Harry to turn the war-torn wizarding world golden. \n\nThere's also the 3-stage alchemical process of actually creating the stone, which happens metaphorically in every book to allow Harry to achieve success each time. I'm so fascinated by the references, imagery, and symbolism JKR has taken time to fold into each chapter & character that I've literally gone through each book and highlighted any reference to this process.

If you read about alchemy in the historical sense, it was believed that creating a philosophers stone required mercury and sulphur, two competing, quarreling elements that needed to achieve balance before the perfect, red, gold-transmuting stone could be created. \n\nHarry is the philosophers stone of the series. Ron, the sulphur - red (literally red-haired), emotional, reactionary. Hermione, the mercury (her initials literally HG, the atomic symbol for mercury) - cool, intellectual. This is why Ron and Hermione quarrel so intensely in the books, and eventually fall in love, resolving this alchemical process and allowing Harry to turn the war-torn wizarding world golden. \n\nThere's also the 3-stage alchemical process of actually creating the stone, which happens metaphorically in every book to allow Harry to achieve success each time. I'm so fascinated by the references, imagery, and symbolism JKR has taken time to fold into each chapter & character that I've literally gone through each book and highlighted any reference to this process. The last 3 books - OotP, HbP, DH - each also represent one stage of the process, ending in the ultimate resolution at the end of DH. \n\nThere are so many layers to this, I could write for hours.

This post has 3500 upvotes right now. How many would buy a set of these books? How will the set fit into their life? I suspect that buyers are likely to display the set prominently and keep it for most of their life. \n\nThe beautiful books you make are not an [inferior good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_good). Ikea furniture is an inferior good. Your books have relatively inelastic [price elasticity of demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand).\n\nOn the supply side, you're an artisan. You make the books yourself and it requires substantial expertise and time. Your current plan isn't to sell thousands (or even dozens) of these per year. You want to sell a few, at least to start.\n\nImagine a high school auditorium where everyone who wants to buy your books for $25 stands up. Then you raise the price to $50 and half of them sit down. Then you raise the price to $200 most sit down. Inelastic demand means you have to raise the price very high for the last few people to sit down. This is a match made in heaven, because you can only make a few sets of books per year anyway.\n\nKeep raising the price until there's only a couple people left standing! How would you spend the money if you were able to charge 5 times as much?

For me it was bad enough that when Sirius appeared in the Order of the Phoenix film I didn't even recognize his character because of how poorly he was handled (in my opinion) in his prior appearance. In fact I never fully grasped why Harry was so gutted at his death until reading the books.

I don't know that this qualifies as \"full circle\".", "id": "d2a9wwv"}, {"comment": "I feel like there are examples of things that come full circle both *between* the books and *within* the books. \n\nAnother example of one that happens within the same book would be in HBP. In *Slug Club*, it has Draco standing over Harry who is covered in blood; later in *Sectumsempra*, Harry is standing over Draco who is covered in blood.\n\nA \"full circle\" moment between two of the books could be between CoS and HBP (though there are many) with the strong presence and significance of Aragog. There are a lot of people who subscribe to Circle Theory when it comes to the HP series. Although JKR has never confirmed, some of the connections are undeniable.", "id": "d2aaaxp"}, {"comment": "Can you go into more detail about what you mean by the significance of Aragog and the Circle Theory?", "id": "d2acai9"}, {"comment": "Sure. In CoS, Aragog is instrumental to Harry and company finding out how the Chamber was opened, how Myrtle died, and eventually leading to the destruction of a Horcrux. In HBP, Aragog is the catalyst for Harry softening up Slughorn to find out more details about Voldemort's knowledge and creation of the other Horcruxes.\n\nWith my rough understanding of Circle Theory as it relates to literature, that would mean that there are significant connections between the books within the series. For example, according to circle theory, the books would relate as follows:\n\n * PS - DH\n\n * COS - HBP\n\n * POA - OOTP\n\nI don't quite know how GOF would fit into it, but there you are. Additionally, this can happen *within* the same book, but with chapters instead. Example: the connection I mention in my original comment with Harry/Draco/blood is from chapters 7 and 24 in HBP. So, if you were counting forward and counting back from the beginning and end of the books, respectfully, you would reach the \"same\" point. For this particular example, it would be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24.\n\nCOS and HBP have a lot of similarities.

In DH, he uses it to hold up the motorcycle when the spell had barely been mentioned at all between the two books. Also, Hedwig enters and exits the series in PS and DH, respectively. **Edit: AND ANOTHER - Harry catches his first Snitch in PS and then it comes back to play quite an important role in holding the Resurrection Stone.

Not a major example and certainly took quite the annoyance to inspire the change (and apparently a long time--as they were still using owls in living memory).\n\nWith that in mind, I don't find it much of a stretch to think that there has simply never been anyone who looked at a library of unhelpfully-organized books and sought to make it easier to find. It may go as far as being fully alphabetical, but certainly nothing like Library of Congress Classification, and I doubt they have a card catalog. It's likely she doesn't teach proper research strategy because her library simply doesn't enable it, and neither she nor anyone else would know how anyways. Adult wizards don't understand very *simple* non-magical concepts. Who would be able to bring that knowledge into the world? A Muggle-Born? Maybe, but they get pulled out of the Muggle world at age 11, and at that age their knowledge of research isn't very good. Most university-aged Muggles suck at it. It would take an uncommon witch or wizard like Hermione to have the interest and drive to bring that knowledge into the Wizarding World, be goo enough at selling it to overcome the stigma of adopting Muggle techniques, teach the average Wizard enough reasoning ability to make proper use of such a system, *and* have not just gotten so used to how libraries work in the Wizarding World that they've forgotten it's a problem.", "id": "d7ot5xi"}, {"comment": "Quote starting with:\n\n>\nA lot of the greatest \n\nContext:\n\n>Quote first found in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in Chapter 16, approx.

I don't think they'd have any interest in using the map to look into Ron and Harry's dormitory. I also don't believe that Voldemort would have even appeared on the map in Philosopher's Stone. I also don't think that the twins use the map nearly often enough to happen to notice the very moments when Ginny disappears off it. They may well have tried to use the map to find out who Slytherin's heir was, but if they did they would have paid no heed to their sister's name, being as they'd have zero suspicion of her."], [6, "I know that the whole \"hahaha Fed and George never noticed their brother sleeping with a strange man every night\" 'plot hole' has been beaten to death, but there are certain things about the map I always assumed that excuse this.\n\nFirst, let's talk about scale. Hogwarts is a huge place with many residents. The jury is still out on exactly how many, but I think there are ~300+ residents at Hogwarts (Students/Teachers/Ghosts) - which I personally think is a modest estimate. With so many bodies for the map the keep track of it's easy to wonder how the map doesn't become a cluttered mess with little labeled dot's everywhere. \n\nMy theory is that the map only shows the bodies that are relevant to the user. So for example, if the user is in the Griffindor Common Room and wants to know if they are alone, then the map will only show the people near by. If the twins want to know if the coast is clear, then the map won't clutter with irrelevant information about who's in Ravenclaw Tower, but instead let the twins know that for example, Snape is near by.\n\nAlso, Hogwarts is physically a massive place, and the map only has a finite space available to show information. This is the weaker of the arguments, but I figure that the sleep quarters would only be very tiny on the map. It's quite possible that even if the twins did check in on Ron, that due to the small scale of the map they could easily have seen Peter Pettigrew right next to Ron, assumed that it was some less popular Griffindor ( maybe a first year they haven't met), and assumed that Peter was just in the next bed over or otherwise nearby. There were probably many dots of people packed into a small area!"], [3, "But the twins didn't even have the map anymore when Crouch was impersonating Moody. So that one at least is bunk.\n\nEdit: Upon looking back at the picture, it seems that they may have snatched it from Harry in that panel. So my comment is moot."], [3, "Actually, if it did label Voldemort it would've said \"Tom Riddle\", whom very few people are even aware is his real name and it would've been in close proximity. They'd also have to have a reason to be looking for Quirrell, I doubt they would even notice if, on the odd occasion they used the map, they would remember that Tom Riddle is always hanging around with Quirrell.\n\nThat said, would they have also been spotting Ginny too? Would they care? I think the only reason they would look for Ginny is on the map is when she went missing. However, I'm surprised they didn't mention this to Dumbledore that \"we've got a map and it shows everyone in Hogwarts, but Ginny isn't on it so she must be outside of the castle\". Wouldn't that be important information? I can't believe they'd keep the map quiet when their sister was supposedly dead.\n\nI guess the same with Pettigrew always around Ron. I mean they surely would've looked Ron up on the map at least once? And he had Pettigrew on him for at least two years that Ron would've shown up on the map. I guess it said they memorised the map and didn't use it but it is a bit strange they wouldn't just sit browsing the thing. It's like having your own set of secret CCTV around the castle. And Ron is fairly close to them to at least look up once where it would show \"Peter Pettigrew\" on him. I mean Harry didn't even scan the map to memorise all the secrets yet the second he looks at it, he finds Peter Pettigrew and he wasn't even on Ron at the time.\n\nAlso, the map does not say that \"Moody is Barty Crouch\". It just labels \"Barty Crouch\". At a time where Barty Crouch is supposed to be in the grounds. But it's not as if Harry doesn't always check it every night to account for everything. I think we're kind of not being shown the sense of scale of it. That said, I think I honestly would just sit with it open as I'm studying nosing around on everyone.

I don't think they'd have any interest in using the map to look into Ron and Harry's dormitory. I also don't believe that Voldemort would have even appeared on the map in Philosopher's Stone. I also don't think that the twins use the map nearly often enough to happen to notice the very moments when Ginny disappears off it.

Hogwarts is a huge place with many residents. The jury is still out on exactly how many, but I think there are ~300+ residents at Hogwarts (Students/Teachers/Ghosts) - which I personally think is a modest estimate. With so many bodies for the map the keep track of it's easy to wonder how the map doesn't become a cluttered mess with little labeled dot's everywhere. \n\nMy theory is that the map only shows the bodies that are relevant to the user. So for example, if the user is in the Griffindor Common Room and wants to know if they are alone, then the map will only show the people near by. If the twins want to know if the coast is clear, then the map won't clutter with irrelevant information about who's in Ravenclaw Tower, but instead let the twins know that for example, Snape is near by.\n\nAlso, Hogwarts is physically a massive place, and the map only has a finite space available to show information. This is the weaker of the arguments, but I figure that the sleep quarters would only be very tiny on the map. It's quite possible that even if the twins did check in on Ron, that due to the small scale of the map they could easily have seen Peter Pettigrew right next to Ron, assumed that it was some less popular Griffindor ( maybe a first year they haven't met), and assumed that Peter was just in the next bed over or otherwise nearby.

They'd also have to have a reason to be looking for Quirrell, I doubt they would even notice if, on the odd occasion they used the map, they would remember that Tom Riddle is always hanging around with Quirrell.\n\nThat said, would they have also been spotting Ginny too? Would they care? I think the only reason they would look for Ginny is on the map is when she went missing. However, I'm surprised they didn't mention this to Dumbledore that \"we've got a map and it shows everyone in Hogwarts, but Ginny isn't on it so she must be outside of the castle\". Wouldn't that be important information? I can't believe they'd keep the map quiet when their sister was supposedly dead.\n\nI guess the same with Pettigrew always around Ron. I mean they surely would've looked Ron up on the map at least once? And he had Pettigrew on him for at least two years that Ron would've shown up on the map. I guess it said they memorised the map and didn't use it but it is a bit strange they wouldn't just sit browsing the thing. It's like having your own set of secret CCTV around the castle. And Ron is fairly close to them to at least look up once where it would show \"Peter Pettigrew\" on him. I mean Harry didn't even scan the map to memorise all the secrets yet the second he looks at it, he finds Peter Pettigrew and he wasn't even on Ron at the time.\n\nAlso, the map does not say that \"Moody is Barty Crouch\". It just labels \"Barty Crouch\". At a time where Barty Crouch is supposed to be in the grounds. But it's not as if Harry doesn't always check it every night to account for everything.

Chances are JKR heard about the Philosopher's Stone as a kid, as did several important UK publishers and thought that would be completely appropriate for children there. Then they probably tried to sell it in the US, and the American publishers (adults) had never even heard of it, and changed it to Sorcerer's. The infamous line JKR was sold was that there was no money in children's books, and I do not blame her or the publishers at all for editing the title of the first book (before they had any idea of the popularity) if they thought it would sell better. \n\nAlso, if we're talking about people who don't know the classic legend of the Philosopher's Stone in the \"real world,\" then calling it the Sorcerer's Stone is a better idea anyway.

I think it comes partly from the fact that this subject, like a few others, is based more on innate talent or affinity, and where success is judged more subjectively, and on things like on style and flare, rather than clearly-defined outcomes. Like flying, and Defence in a certain way.\n\nShe is great at magics where your success is immediately apparent, and generally speaking, easily compared. Flying is a more physical skill where she lacks an innate talent, and in Divination while a true prediction can be verified there is little guarantee of a temporal period within which that assessment can be properly made, so the charisma and charm and persuasive sense the person gives off is more important - Trelawney is all bangles, all incense, with scary, intriguing claims. As a socially awkward person who derived a lot of satisfaction from confidently pursuing good grades and praises, a subject that requires performative, vague, self-important claims is her worst nightmare.\n\nWhat is a way more badass demonstration of her character though is her campaign for the house elves. This made me cringe SO HARD as a teenaged-fan - definitely my least favourite Hermione moment. But now I see it as this amazing manifestation of naive, zealous ethical dedication.\n\nShe is muggle-born. She has classmates who call her what are effectively racial slurs. She knows there've been evil megalomaniac wealthy powerful wizards who kill witches like her, and their families. She is obsessively well-read on the history of Hogwarts but not on pure-blood traditions. And how does she react to discovering what in her estimation amounts to organized slavery? To finding out her welcoming home in this new world is guilty of the same travesties she knows purebloods commit, and even makes a secret out of it? This is of course after finding out about the chamber of secrets and almost being killed by it. *She organizes a fucking protest.* This bright-eyed, over-eager, insecure child does not run away from this hostile place but instead tries to take on the entire fucking establishment, with the help of no one, even Harry and Ron treat her like she's a lunatic, and even though it alienates her further from her classmates, AND she devotes time to get studies and her hyjinxes with her friends, she still devotes herself to trying to free the house elves.\n\nAnd I mean let's face it, in terms of all the cool magic and advanced stuff in Deathly Hallows, Hermione's stealth stuff takes the cake by far. This 17-year-old is skilled enough to hide the great Harry Potter from Voldemort, his followers, the snatchers, etc. I mean obviously these people and groups would be using magic to find him, and Hermione consistently hides the fuck out of him. She is literally the coolest person.\n\nIt has always stuck out to me that in a series where orphans, particularly war orphans, are a huge theme, a key similarity between  Harry and Voldemort, and reiterated in Teddy Lupin at the end, to name a couple - Hermione is the only character who orphans herself. Tom Riddle killing his father is the only comparison.

You can't deny magic when the stairs are literally moving on their own, you've passed into a brick wall to another train station and chocolate frogs jump out of their packaging!\n\nAll those other types of magic have theories and proofs behind them, it's something that everyone can learn to do and it will work every single time, but Divination is something that only a few people can truly do and there's no real proof that it work. Did this event happen because you foretold it or is it simply a coincidence?\n\nThat's something that Hermione hates. She can't accept things that can't be explained or reasoned, that don't have any proof. The same way she gets annoyed at Luna for believing in Nargles, because there are no records of them. Luna annoys Hermione because she believes in a lot of things that haven't been proven to exist, such things Hermione dismisses instantly. Luna believes in even the most far fetched possibilities, Hermione only believes in the possibilities that have facts applied to them. As long as she can find a link or a connection somewhere (ex; mentioned once in a book she read, let's say), she will consider the idea.\n\nPlus, we've seen that Hermione dislikes not being good at things. When Harry was better at her in potions, it drove her nuts. Because Hermione isn't open-minded to the \"mystical\", she's not good at Divination and she HATES it.

I think it comes partly from the fact that this subject, like a few others, is based more on innate talent or affinity, and where success is judged more subjectively, and on things like on style and flare, rather than clearly-defined outcomes. Like flying, and Defence in a certain way.\n\nShe is great at magics where your success is immediately apparent, and generally speaking, easily compared. Flying is a more physical skill where she lacks an innate talent, and in Divination while a true prediction can be verified there is little guarantee of a temporal period within which that assessment can be properly made, so the charisma and charm and persuasive sense the person gives off is more important - Trelawney is all bangles, all incense, with scary, intriguing claims. As a socially awkward person who derived a lot of satisfaction from confidently pursuing good grades and praises, a subject that requires performative, vague, self-important claims is her worst nightmare.\n\nWhat is a way more badass demonstration of her character though is her campaign for the house elves. This made me cringe SO HARD as a teenaged-fan - definitely my least favourite Hermione moment. But now I see it as this amazing manifestation of naive, zealous ethical dedication.\n\nShe is muggle-born. She has classmates who call her what are effectively racial slurs. She knows there've been evil megalomaniac wealthy powerful wizards who kill witches like her, and their families. She is obsessively well-read on the history of Hogwarts but not on pure-blood traditions. And how does she react to discovering what in her estimation amounts to organized slavery? To finding out her welcoming home in this new world is guilty of the same travesties she knows purebloods commit, and even makes a secret out of it? This is of course after finding out about the chamber of secrets and almost being killed by it. *She organizes a fucking protest.* This bright-eyed, over-eager, insecure child does not run away from this hostile place but instead tries to take on the entire fucking establishment, with the help of no one, even Harry and Ron treat her like she's a lunatic, and even though it alienates her further from her classmates, AND she devotes time to get studies and her hyjinxes with her friends, she still devotes herself to trying to free the house elves.\n\nAnd I mean let's face it, in terms of all the cool magic and advanced stuff in Deathly Hallows, Hermione's stealth stuff takes the cake by far. This 17-year-old is skilled enough to hide the great Harry Potter from Voldemort, his followers, the snatchers, etc. I mean obviously these people and groups would be using magic to find him, and Hermione consistently hides the fuck out of him. She is literally the coolest person.\n\nIt has always stuck out to me that in a series where orphans, particularly war orphans, are a huge theme, a key similarity between  Harry and Voldemort, and reiterated in Teddy Lupin at the end, to name a couple - Hermione is the only character who orphans herself. Tom Riddle killing his father is the only comparison. I think in that way Hermione is more his magical opposite than Harry.", "id": "cyswghp"}, {"comment": "That was a bit of a tangent. But the most exciting and enlightening tangents I've read all week, at least.", "id": "cysye8c"}, {"comment": "Yeah. That or the fact that its well-established that Dumbledore also thinks Divination is bullshit aside from the prophecy that Trelawney gave to him personally. And she's only teaching so that Dumbledore can keep her close in order to protect her from Voldemort. The work was pretty explicit that Dumbledore didn't even want to take on a Divination teacher at all. Yet ended up hiring two; in both cases to grant them asylum rather than on any accomplishments at teaching.\n\nEven the prophecy itself. Dumbledore admits to the effect that the only thing that actually gave it weight was the fact that Snape saw parts of it and relayed the information to Voldemort and Voldemort acted upon it.\n\nPersonally, I think you're taking a gander at Trelawney's crystal ball by over-embellishing Hermione's motives. But that's only the way I see it from way over here.", "id": "cysz1t6"}, {"comment": "But this is exactly the issue - prophecies are either fulfilled or not, but the extent to which the outcome is influenced by the credence given to the prophecy by those aware of it creates the puzzle: is Snape's over-hearing of it, and Voldemort's likelihood of taking it seriously, and the significance of Voldemort assuming it pertains to the Potters rather than the Longbottoms, Snape's love of Lily, and how her peril and death cement his defection from the Death Eaters, and then later, his spying, Dumbledore taking the prophecy seriously, and Harry taking it seriously, all contribute to the prophecy being fulfilled, an aspect of the prophecy itself, or something altogether separate? That is, if people treating the prophecy as true, and circumstances coming together to allow it to be true, create what is in effect a \"true\" prophecy, does that make it true, or not? What standard or threshold need to be met? If a prophecy is only legitimate when it comes to be without anyone's knowledge then I guess that's one definition, but I think Rowling was exactly setting up a version of divination which plays on that kind of circular justification.\n\nHowever much Dumbledore doubts divination, he still treats this prophecy as significant. Also, were the trio aware of his attitude when they began divination lessons in their third year?", "id": "cyt0gv4"}, {"comment": "I think you're exactly right.

Did this event happen because you foretold it or is it simply a coincidence?\n\nThat's something that Hermione hates.

Trelawney's power is limited to sometimes passively getting a vague glimpse of the future, which were believed, whereas her daily life revolved around charlatanry and superstitions. \n\nThere are no parallels between Cassandra and Trelawney.

She's clearly a charlatan!\" only to later reveal her as _the source of Harry's prophecy_, along the same lines as Snape's clear evilness setting the reader up for \"Why on earth does Dumbledore trust him?!\" only to reveal him later as a textbook anti-hero. \n\nThe theory of this thread would basically undermine the premise of her character, though it would still kind of work because you're unlikely to see the links during first read. However, I'm 99% sure that was not JK Rowling's intent: the intent was to paint her as a charlatan, to increase the bombshell effect of the reveal of her prophecy (which ultimately wasn't necessary correct).\n\nThe books are incredible, but people are getting drawn into overanalyzing. There aren't layers upon layers upon layers. There is a solid story with good characters and cleverly hidden omens, but those are all one-dimensional.

It is entirely possible that any other date would have caused Voldemort to go after a different child and, as long as the mother died for her child, would have lead to the same outcome.\n\nUltimately what destroyed Voldemort was his urge to go after whatever could harm him. If the prophecy had been \"Voldemort will die at the bottom of a volcano\", he might have gone on a quest to destroy all volcanoes and, in the process, die at the bottom of one.\n\nIn fact, knowing that Trewlaney's prediction record is somewhat shakey otherwise, it is not inconceivable to say that the prophecy may have been a fake, a trap planted by Dumbledore or so.

However, you're not wrong to state that it is still often referred to as midwinter. Technically that means we could call now midspring.\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on Winter:\n\n>In the Northern Hemisphere, some authorities define the period of winter based on astronomical fixed points (i.e. based solely on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the sun), regardless of weather conditions. In one version of this definition, winter begins at the winter solstice and ends at the vernal equinox.[12] These dates are somewhat later than those used to define the beginning and end of the meteorological winter \u2013 usually considered to span the entirety of December, January, and February in the Northern Hemisphere. \n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on Winter Solstice:\n\n>The winter solstice itself lasts only a moment in time, so other terms are used for the day on which it occurs, such as \"midwinter\", or the \"shortest day\". It is often considered the \"extreme of winter\" (Dongzhi in the Chinese calendar). In meteorology, winter in the Northern Hemisphere spans the entire period of December through February.\n\nAnd just for fun, a tidbit about [Seasonal Delay](http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/NorthStar/Unit5/unit5_sub3.htm) \n\n>In places where the difference between the length of day and night is greater between summer and winter (such as very far north \u2013 Alaska, Norway, etc), the solstices are called midsummer and midwinter.  But where the temperature variation is more noticeable than the variation in the length of the day, like in Iowa or the lower United States, we use the terms \"the first day of summer,\" etc.\nIt actually does make some sense.  The coldest day of the year is not generally close to the shortest day, however, but comes a couple of weeks to a month later. Our coldest months are December, January, and February, even though the winter solstice is in December.  So there is a delay, or lag between the shortest day (the day with the least amount of sunlight during the year) and the coldest time of the year.\n\nIf we get more direct sunlight (and more sunlight in general due to the longer days) at the summer solstice than on any other day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, why isn't June 21 (the summer solstice) the hottest day of the year?\n\n... The reason for this delay between maximum heating and maximum heat (temperature) is that it takes time to warm up the ground.  Similarly, in the winter, heat stored in the ground gradually leaks out, giving us our coldest weather in January and not in December, when the shortest day occurs.\n\nTL,DR Yes, it's the start of winter, but it's still called midwinter.", "id": "d1ac8mh"}, {"comment": "I don't know why you are downvoted.

Obviously the saddest day of my life, but HP really helped pull me through. After all...Harry and I had something in common, and like so many others, my attachment to HP runs so, so deep.\n\nFast forward to Halloween 2004. I go to a JK Rowling book signing - it's the last tour she ever did in the US and she only signed 1,000 books at the site. We had to get there at 5am to get spots, and I went all out to dress like Hermione. Head to toe homemade Gryffindor gear (merch didn't really exist at that point), and I even made a Time Turner (PoA had *just* been released). My mom and I were 99 and 100 in line, and I get up to the front for Jo to sign my book, she looks at me and says, \"Oh, I love your outfit...but the wand's a little Slytherin...\" and she winks at me.\n\nThen the movies come out. Alan Rickman plays a perfect Snape. And he kinda looks like my dad. Not lying.\n\nAfter the final novel is released, Pottermore comes along. I'm in my 20s at this point, but I'm still a die hard fan. I decide to take the sorting test...and I'm placed in Slytherin.\n\n**Rowling knew. Back when I was 12, after meeting me for a minute, she totally knew.** I think she really is a witch.\n\nThen I find out that Snape's birthday is January 9th. Weird. Very, very weird. The man who gave me my wand, who was almost certainly a Slytherin himself, the man who meant more to me than anyone...shared a birthday with Snape. My head of house. And the actor who plays him looks strangely like my dad.

I told him how much he meant to me and how his works had inspired me to get into youth theatre (I had been involved for ~3 years at the time), and he smiled at me. He had the most genuine, happy smile I've ever seen. He said \"thank you, that means so much to me\", and my mom piped up and said \"she's been wanting to meet you forever. Thanks for making this her best Christmas ever.\" Then, he looked between her, me, her, and finally me, did that wonderful smile again and said \"Well, merry Christmas to you!\" And all I could manage to splutter out was \"LIKEWISE!\" It's an experience that means so much to me, and I'll hold it even closer to my heart now that he's passed away.

One of those clear glass ones that had bits of green stuff and star and moon shaped glitter floating in it.\n\nMy dad died from cancer in 2002. Obviously the saddest day of my life, but HP really helped pull me through. After all...Harry and I had something in common, and like so many others, my attachment to HP runs so, so deep.\n\nFast forward to Halloween 2004. I go to a JK Rowling book signing - it's the last tour she ever did in the US and she only signed 1,000 books at the site. We had to get there at 5am to get spots, and I went all out to dress like Hermione. Head to toe homemade Gryffindor gear (merch didn't really exist at that point), and I even made a Time Turner (PoA had *just* been released). My mom and I were 99 and 100 in line, and I get up to the front for Jo to sign my book, she looks at me and says, \"Oh, I love your outfit...but the wand's a little Slytherin...\" and she winks at me.\n\nThen the movies come out. Alan Rickman plays a perfect Snape. And he kinda looks like my dad. Not lying.\n\nAfter the final novel is released, Pottermore comes along. I'm in my 20s at this point, but I'm still a die hard fan. I decide to take the sorting test...and I'm placed in Slytherin.\n\n**Rowling knew. Back when I was 12, after meeting me for a minute, she totally knew.** I think she really is a witch.\n\nThen I find out that Snape's birthday is January 9th. Weird. Very, very weird. The man who gave me my wand, who was almost certainly a Slytherin himself, the man who meant more to me than anyone...shared a birthday with Snape. My head of house. And the actor who plays him looks strangely like my dad. So the only obvious logic here is that Snape is my dad ;)\n\nOkay, not really, but the bottom line here is that reading the news about Alan Rickman this morning hit me really hard.

You want to emphasize the legs because it subconsciously suggests height).\n\nBelts also break up the visual line that draws the eye upward and suggests height. So no belt. If you're in a suit, go beltless but use suspenders instead. No belt but with suspenders is a totally normal thing to do in the Western world with suits.\n\nIf you aren't tucket your shirt in, it should go just to your belt line. Long shirts will make you look short.\n\nIn general, fitted clothing. Loose clothing will make you look fat, and if you're small, it will make you look like a child wearing his father's clothing.\n\nAnd if you're fat, stop being fat. Fat and short is an unfixable combination for looking taller because the width will de-emphasize any height you have.\n\nYou could also change your hair to have a bit more height, wear boots (which will often give you an extra half inch or inch), etc.\n\nI'm sure if you googled clothing tips for short fellows, you'd find information. I'm normal in pretty much every way, so these are mostly things I'm coming up with off the top of my head based on general design and artistic principles I learned in art class years ago.\n\nAlternatively, look up all the short guys in Hollywood and ape what they wear.

There was also a back side with a few things as well, one being a bio of JK Rowling, another looks like explanations of strange words (sherbet lemon) [here you go](http://imgur.com/a/2NaPt). ", "id": "d5yfgzo"}, {"comment": "This will be fine to use, thanks!! I'll have a crack at it when I get up today (it's almost 2.30amw whoops) and see what I can get!", "id": "d5yfmc4"}, {"comment": "Dunno what kind of progress you've made, but I transcribed about half of the Owlpost page (up to the \u300c\u5b66\u6821\u306e\u5148\u751f\u300d section in the left column) to help you out a bit.  I'm a total novice, so there might be a few mistakes (proofread it the best I could), and I'm not gonna bother attempting a translation, but it should at least eliminate some of the drudgery of looking up unfamiliar kanji!  I'm going to go to bed myself, but I'd happy to do some more transcription tomorrow if it'd be helpful.\n\n---\n\n\u30cf\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30dd\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u3068

\u52a3\u7b49\u751f (*rettousei*, \"poor student(s)\").  The most interesting bit is probably the translator lamenting being unable to fully convey Hagrid's Scottish accent.\n\nAs has been said in a reply below, most of this can be understood pretty well by just tossing it into Google Translate--I just don't trust myself to do a natural translation, since I lack the requisite language mastery.  I figure that having a ~99% accurate transcription will make it easier for someone *does* want to take a crack at doing a proper translation for everything.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that there's (at least) one section missing, though, since I only saw sections 2 and 3 of the \"P Guru\" feature.

I'm not going to accuse anyone of a crime until there's actually evidence of it.\n\nAlso, \"Panama Papers\" doesn't mean everyone's money was in Panama.

It's a shell corporation, which is a really common tool for multi-national companies and wealthy people. There are a bunch of ways to use a shell corporation, and privacy is one of the most common. If you have a rich guy who wants to invest in publicly traded corporations, but wants to do so anonymously, he can set up a shell company to put money in and have that shell buy the stocks so it's not linked directly to him. It's exactly what I'd do if I had that kind of money.\n\nAnd how is the British Virgin Islands \"a small country I have never been to\"? It's one of the main locations for shell companies because it has no corporate tax rate. If you do a shell company in your home country you can get double-taxed. If I set up a corporation here in the US, and put money into it and had the company buy assets, the company would have to pay taxes on its profits, then I'd have to pay my own taxes on what's left. They set up shell companies in places like the Virgin Islands because that skips the corporation tax step. We have a few more options in the US to avoid double-taxation. I don't think the UK has an equivalent.\n\nUnless she's making the money illegally in the first place (and we know exactly how she got rich so that's not an issue), she's already paid taxes on the money she puts into the shell company. Once it's in the company, she doesn't directly benefit from growth of those assets unless the company pays her back a dividend. She would then pay taxes on that dividend. So as long as she's doing that last part, she's not doing anything wrong.

Many of these smaller towns might have economies that are or were based on similar manufacturing or refining (coal, farming, or oil). Where jobs have been shifting away due to increased free trade (hence the globalism hate) or increased environmental conscientiousness (again, shifting money back to the technological markets).\n\nNow that's the problem and the government failed to address it (plenty of blame to go around) but it is also a complex and difficult problem to solve. How do you transition, say, a town built in the 50s for coal mining to a modern economy. It's fairly isolated, the infrastructure has been built around that industry, the population isn't high enough to warrant massive investment from the federal/state government and the local community is too poor to invest themselves.

I really, *really* appreciate it though...to a level where I don't really know what to say other than *thank you*.   :)\n\nI had a ton of help with the party.  OP's co-worker helped with the planning and with several of the areas.  She's a hardcore Slytherin so she tackled the Slytherin Common Room, the Potions room, Borgin & Burkes, and the Chamber of Secrets.  My parents made the amazing wand holders and helped with the set up.  My mom has sort of new agey taste, so a lot of the decorations are things that we had around the house.  My brother helped with the set up and cut out / sewed the ties.  Most of the food (except the candy and cake) was brought by guests, which helped a lot.\n\nA lot of people have been wondering how I found the time to do all this without him finding out.  Luckily I have about an hour and a half after I get home from work before OP gets home.  So a lot of the crafting was done then or on my lunch hour.  I work very close to my parents' house so I was able to gradually set things up when I went home for lunch.  I will say that in the week leading up to the party I had so much left to do that I just told OP that I was working on \"something\" for his birthday and I just holed up in the bedroom to work in everything.  By that point I was very stressed out and concerned about finishing. \n\nAll of the wands were made from sticks that I picked up around the yard at my parents' house at lunch.  I like to mess around with woodcarving so I already had the knives and a Dremel, which was very useful for making the wands.  I do really enjoy crafting, so I already had a lot of the tools I needed.  The biggest expense was definitely the crafting supplies, but all in all, I made just about everything, so it was really not *that* expensive of a party.  My favorite things to make were probably the wands, but I also really enjoyed making the Quiddich pennants and the Sorting Hat. I really like how the Hogsmeade sign came out, but it was probably the biggest pain in the ass out of everything to make.  I tried a couple of different methods before settling on using a heat knife to cut the design out of foam core.  I used pre-cut wood letters that I got a Walmart for the lettering, glued everything together and painted it a matte black to look like the wrought iron sign.    \n\nThanks again so much for reading.  I can't take too much credit...there's a ton of great ideas on the internet.  It was a lot of work, but it was honestly a dream come true to be able to plan the Harry Potter party of my dreams.

I am seriously blown away by how many people liked the photos.  I honestly thought that the majority of the comments we would get would be from people saying we posted too many pictures.  I really, *really* appreciate it though...to a level where I don't really know what to say other than *thank you*.   :)\n\nI had a ton of help with the party.  OP's co-worker helped with the planning and with several of the areas.  She's a hardcore Slytherin so she tackled the Slytherin Common Room, the Potions room, Borgin & Burkes, and the Chamber of Secrets.  My parents made the amazing wand holders and helped with the set up.  My mom has sort of new agey taste, so a lot of the decorations are things that we had around the house.  My brother helped with the set up and cut out / sewed the ties.  Most of the food (except the candy and cake) was brought by guests, which helped a lot.\n\nA lot of people have been wondering how I found the time to do all this without him finding out.  Luckily I have about an hour and a half after I get home from work before OP gets home.  So a lot of the crafting was done then or on my lunch hour.  I work very close to my parents' house so I was able to gradually set things up when I went home for lunch.  I will say that in the week leading up to the party I had so much left to do that I just told OP that I was working on \"something\" for his birthday and I just holed up in the bedroom to work in everything.  By that point I was very stressed out and concerned about finishing. \n\nAll of the wands were made from sticks that I picked up around the yard at my parents' house at lunch.  I like to mess around with woodcarving so I already had the knives and a Dremel, which was very useful for making the wands.  I do really enjoy crafting, so I already had a lot of the tools I needed.  The biggest expense was definitely the crafting supplies, but all in all, I made just about everything, so it was really not *that* expensive of a party.  My favorite things to make were probably the wands, but I also really enjoyed making the Quiddich pennants and the Sorting Hat. I really like how the Hogsmeade sign came out, but it was probably the biggest pain in the ass out of everything to make.  I tried a couple of different methods before settling on using a heat knife to cut the design out of foam core.  I used pre-cut wood letters that I got a Walmart for the lettering, glued everything together and painted it a matte black to look like the wrought iron sign.    \n\nThanks again so much for reading.  I can't take too much credit...there's a ton of great ideas on the internet.  It was a lot of work, but it was honestly a dream come true to be able to plan the Harry Potter party of my dreams.  OP is an amazing boyfriend and he totally deserved it.  You guys are the best!!   \n\n", "id": "d3aztbf"}, {"comment": "Can confirm. This is indeed my girlfriend.

What pushed Regulus over the edge? What made him turn his back on the Dark Lord? Why was his bond with Kreacher so strong (isn't a bit odd for a Slytherin to care for a house-elf)? What was his relationship with his other family members?\n\nI've always thought that RAB was one of the books' greatest mysteries, and even though we know how the story ends, I think it would be super cool if it was fleshed out.", "id": "d5ljbz7"}], [{"comment": "Not really, I feel like she would feel pressured to create a lot of links to Harry's time that probably didn't exist to her in her head when she was writing her books.

I get the whole idea that the hat sorts based on the potential you show, and not necessarily your traits, but god damn. That dude repeatedly shows cowardice at every opportunity for bravery throughout the series.

It's true that, unlike most Gryffindors, Neville frequently demonstrates fear and avoids dangerous situations, but when necessary, he consistently demonstrated an ability to act despite his fear, proving he is not a coward. Wormtail is the exact opposite. He consistently demonstrates fear, and, when push comes to shove, he always gives in to it. \n\nThe only two examples in his entire character arc I can think of are a) sparing Harry in Deathly Hallows, and b) becoming an Animagi to help Lupin. To be honest, I barely even think a counts. Technically he didn't exactly 'spare' Harry, he considered sparing Harry, which was enough disloyalty to trigger the hand to strangle him. While I know most people read it as a small humanizing moment for Wormtail, I just saw it as another example of Wormtail demonstrating that he was never truly loyal to anyone, just an opportunist who sides with whoever he sees as the most powerful. \n\nI think he's better suited for Slytherin, to be honest, although he's not ambitious in the traditional sense. He doesn't want to be the best, he wants to ride the coattails of the best to the top. Hell, it's the reason he befriended James and Sirius in the first place.

Just remember she was very young when she met and married Vernon, possibly around 20, became a housewife and had a child because she thought that's what you were supposed to do. Petunia never really and time for personal development, Vernon squashed it all out of her. Then she got handed a child she never wanted that reminded  her of the man she thinks influenced her sister and had her killed. Harry reminded her of her pain and suffering daily. Petunia held onto tiny scraps of information told other by her sister about the magical world for years, so she was listening and she did care. \n\n\nedit, did Petunia ever properly grieve her sister. I suspect she didn't, not with Vernon looking down at such shows of weakness. It doesn't matter how long it has been since someone has passed away, sometimes when you think about it, its like a punch in the stomach. If you never grieve and never resolve anything its going to be those same feelings no matter how long it is since its been. Lilly was murdered in a brutal way, instead of being angry at Voldemort, she is angry at her sister. She lost her sister when she was still mad at her, still holding onto unresolved feelings surrounding their parents.

The chaotic whooshing of bodies past her slowed and finally stopped entirely. What on earth had happened?\n\nGinny decided to back up and take stock of her situation. Her head hurt, as did her thigh. She was on the ground. She was in the same hallway on the third floor of Hogwarts, just around the corner from the gargoyle statue. Good, she figured. The castle was still here and she hadn't somehow apparated unintentionally. She wasn't lost. \n\nBut what was she doing here? The mental fog took a moment to subside. She had tripped over a broken chunk of floor (no doubt a result of a struggle between a DA member and one of the new 'teachers') while slinking back from Dumbledore's (or rather, Snape's, she seethed) office. She had been too focused on checking over her shoulder because she didn't want to get caught with the - \n\n\"TIME TURNER!\" Ginny spat to herself, frantically checking her pocket. The contents explained the pain in her thigh. The delicate hourglass lay in pieces in her palm, its sand softly glowing as it slipped through her fingers. She had landed on it.\n\n\"Brilliant. It was all for nothing and now I'm probably going to Azkaban,\" Ginny lamented. One less tool to usurp the death eaters now dictating their education.\n\nBut what of the explosion? The blinding flash of seemingly colorless light? And the shapes speeding past her like a muggle cassette tape being rewound? There was no time to wonder, though, as a voice became apparent from around the corner. She froze. There was nowhere to hide and running would be too loud in her oxfords.\n\nShe scooped the broken time turner back into her pocket and braced herself to stand against one of the Carrows, who usually patrolled this part of the castle at night. But instead of the pallid sunken grimace of a death eater, the face that appeared was a kind smile with twinkling eyes framed by a neat auburn mane, partially pulled back. It was a boy. A student, in fact. \n\nHe halted calmly. His eyes seemed to gaze through hers reading something deeper inside. It was as if time had broken all over again. She could feel the blush building up in her cheeks at this surprisingly handsome boy. But why didn't she know him? He looked to be about her age and he was wearing Gryffindor robes.  \n\nJust then, another voice called from behind her.\n\n\"Are you coming to the pitch? You're going to be late!\" The voice gave way to a body, another student trotting down the hallway. \"What's taking you so long, Albus?\"", "id": "dam44lc"}, {"comment": "I'm having entirely too much fun with this.\n\nPart 2\n=\nGinny Weasley was in no mood to play quiddich. \n\nThe past 4 months had been like a dream. She had all but forgotten the troubles of her time and gracefully slipped into the routine of life in 19th century Hogwarts. Albus and Elphias had become her Harry and Ron, and her strange affection for Albus had only grown since the unlikely trio formed on that fateful day by the headmaster's gargoyle statue, though he seemed to keep her at arms length.\n\nAfter convincing Headmaster Black that she was a distant cousin of his on the Prewett side (which was not technically untrue) that had moved to Denmark, she was properly enrolled in classes. Elphias *accidentally* spilled a half-finished anti-boil potion on the Gryffindor seeker, putting her in the way of standing in on the house team. Everything was perfect. \n\nRepairing the time turner to find a way home had been pushed to the furthest reaches of her mind. But the weight slowly built. She had left her time in the hands of Voldemort (albeit unintentionally) while on a mission to overthrow him. She knew it was only a matter of time before she forgot about her home entirely and adopted her new life permanantly, but what would come of that in the future? Ginny would disappear in the midst of a war only to show up to the very same war too old to be of help. What if she ran into her past self? She couldn't possibly be with her family. Then on top of everything, she knew when and how her unlikely new crush would die and had already attended his funeral once. Everything about staying sounded like a destructive universal paradox waiting to happen. \n\nSo she had set to work. The research was grueling. All nighters in the restricted section had become the norm. She made a habit of posing hypothetical thought experiments concerning deep magic so that any time-related questions wouldn't be met with suspicion or surprise. It worked quite well and effectively endeared Albus to her. Ginny could see the curiosity flare in Albus's eyes any time she began a sentence with a thoughtful \"Hmmmm.....\" \n\nBy November, she had pieced together enough research to settle on a charm to reenchant the time turner. By December, she had finished reconstructing the gyroscope-like hourglass mechanism. It hadn't been easy work, and *reparo* had done little more than blow more of the sand away. But it was almost ready. Once she recast the charm, the time turner would spring back to life and throw her forward to when (and possibly where) she had come from, setting the linear flow of time right once more. That meant leaving this peaceful Hogwarts and returning to war. That meant leaving *Albus* and returning to *post-Dumbledore*. \n\nSo today, Ginny Weasley was in no mood to play Quiddich.\n\n\"Ginny, what is going on with you?\" quipped Elphias. from the far bench of the nearly empty locker room. \n\nAlbus frowned. \"Elphias is right, Gin. I've never seen you happer than before a Quiddich game, but you seem to be somewhere else at the moment.\"\n\n\"I'm just feeling ill, I think. I think it's the weather,\" she lied, putting on a smile.\n\n\"AHA!\" exclaimed Albus as he reached into his robes, pulling out a pair of thick wollen socks. He held them out to her. \"They call me crazy, but I never go anywhere without an extra pair!\"\n\nGinny couldn't help but laugh at his glee. Harry had told her of Dumbledore's obsession. She took the socks and began ushering them both out as the voices of her teammates approached.\n\nAlbus paused at the door, hesitated, and pulled her into a quick hug.\n\n\"I know there's something wrong,\" he whispered. \"I know all too well how secrets manifest themselves on one's face.\"\n\nWith a wink and a fourish through the door, he was gone.\n", "id": "damj57t"}, {"comment": "Please continue.

", "id": "d6gpwxe"}, {"comment": "What instances of dei ex machinae would you say occur in HP?\n\nThere are a number of instances of forward planning and foreshadowing in the books, not only within a single book but across the whole series. The most well-known is the appearance of a Horcrux as early as book 2 (Riddle's Diary), which is initially presented as an odd but isolated magical object. Four books later, its true importance becomes apparent, and in the final book Harry's method of destroying it is explained.\n\nOther examples include Sirius Black being referenced as giving Hagrid his motorcycle in PS, which became important in PoA; Dumbledore's Deluminator, introduced in around the second chapter of the whole series, which becomes significant in the final book; even Harry being a sort of partial Horcrux, which isn't fully realised until the final act, is discussed as early as the first or second chapter of the books.\n\nI'll allow that the first book especially uses some different terminology and concepts to those solidified later, which I mostly chalk up to the first book being essentially a 'Pilot'.\n\nThe first couple of books do introduce a new spell that Harry learns, which is then later used in the end game of that book. But the books are told almost exclusively from the perspective of a young man with no prior knowledge of the magical world as he progresses through a school for teaching magic. As he develops his skills and learns more about the world, he (and therefore we) discover new spells and concepts. \n\nSome of these would, I agree, have been helpful things for Harry to have known in previous conflicts, but that's how things work in real life too. We build knowledge and learn new skills. There are parts of French and Spanish grammar I didn't learn until the second year of my degree, which would have been nice to know years previously. \n\nBut giving a gigantic info dump at the beginning of the books, introducing every concept, spell and idea before cracking on with the story, would be a pretty laborious read.\n\nAs for the Time Turners...what's the issue with them?  They're explicitly shown to create only Stable Time Loops, and Hermione's use of one during PoA is foreshadowed throughout the book. They're introduced as being strictly controlled and regulated artefacts. We're only aware of their existence from the end of book three, and the Ministry's stock is destroyed at the end of book 5. \n\nJK's explanation and development of the hard and fast rules of magic aren't great, I'll concede. There are a lot of unexplained restrictions and laws, but we don't need to know the process of spell creation, or every limit of potioneering. In a series of 7 books, it's not possible to explain every character's backstory, every object's history, or every concept in full.\n\nPottermore is a good way for JK to provide further details and information on things, but there wasn't anything unexplained in the books that prevented me from enjoying or understanding their plot.", "id": "d6grs2o"}, {"comment": "Your question about time turners makes me think that you didn't read the Cursed Child book...

Akin to sight, it's not something that you think about, but you can practice to develop the ability into a valuable talent. \n\nWhat I have read usually describes wands as enhancers/augmenters of natural magic ability. They act as a conductor. Spells act as a conductor as well. Linguistic sciences explore power and cultural implications of words, showing how words selected for communication have an impact on how we see those words. The same holds true in the construction of a fantasy world and its spells (at least in the well made ones). The words that make up spells are believed to hone and direct those feelings into action. \n\nYou see similar attitudes in japanese martial arts (not anime!), where the concept of Kiai is part of honing/enhancing a move. Part of Kiai (shouting while attacking) is to startle an opponent, but it also serves to better the attack through motivation, mental imagery, and breathing. Language is a large part of the human experience, and by pairing up a spell with certain words, the implication is to form a multi-form connection with that spell and it's meaning (although Harry Potter does deviate from that a bit). \n\nI'm getting wordy, so let me know if this is helpful at all :P", "id": "d6gogm3"}, {"comment": "They are not dumb questions.

Usually a character will have an object or word or action (et cetera) to sort of \"guide\" the magic to their use, the wands and spells in Harry Potter for example, or the martial arts in Avatar to summon a character's bending abilities, so on and so forth. But in these stories we're often introduced to a character that embodies \"the Best\". This is Dumbledore in the Harry Potter universe, who is seen casting spells without his wand, so we come to find that with great power and will one can use magic without the \"guiding\" object. We see this in Avatar as well with King Bumi, in The Last Airbender he's seen trapped in a metal box with only his face showing, and uses small jerks of his head to bend large portions of earth, suggesting the ability to bend is less concerned with the physical movents and more influenced by one's will. \n\nThis theme is fairly pervasive though, and my conclusion is that \"magic\" is some form of accessible energy in these universes and the people have built their societies around ways to use this energy (human is as human does). \n\nSo really the \"guiding\" object/word/yadda yadda is fairly arbitrary in the grand scheme of the story, and their purpose is usually considered flexible and at the author's control, able to be altered if the story requires. What's important is the character's intent when using it.\n\nAnyway, sorry for rambling, and kinda going too far into the topic to be relevant.

Hermione is the instigator of much of the trio's rulebreaking (the DA is her idea, for instance!); she never shies away from telling Ron or Harry when they are being stupid or foolhardy (e.g. the midnight duel in PS, when she's not even really friends with them and is desperately lonely), or from pushing her own ideas even when they disagree with the recieved wisdom of everyone around her (SPEW, anyone?) (in this, Hermione is more like Lily than she is like Remus, from the limited amount we see of Lily); she is probably innately crueller than Ron or Harry, while in the Marauders Era we are given the distinct impression that it is Sirius and James who are the cruel ones.\n\n**Neville/Peter**: as much as fandom likes to pretend otherwise, the Marauders are clearly a foursome, and though Peter betrayed them in the end, he was as much a part of the group as the other three while he was at school.  He was an animagus with the others, he appears in the Marauder's Map with the others.  Neville is clearly very much on the fringes of the Harry/Ron/Hermione trio; he is no more a part of their group than Ginny and Luna are.  In the final book, he stays at Hogwarts with Ginny and Luna while Harry, Ron, and Hermione go off on the camping trip of doom, despite being in their year and of age by the time they leave.\n\n**Ginny/Lily**: James is clearly infatuated with Lily for a long time before she returns his affection, this is absolutely not the case with Ginny and Harry.  As we know barely anything else about Lily, aside from the fact that like Ginny she had red hair, there's little else to base parallels on here, but (probably wealthy-ish middle-class) muggleborn vs poor pureblood, prodigy vs. talented and powerful but not at all the best witch of her generation (Harry clearly thinks that this honour goes to Hermione): Hermione shares just as many, if not more characteristics with Lily than Ginny does.\n\n**Ron/Sirius**: I'm genuinely struggling to think what the parallels here are meant to be, beyond \"best friend of Harry/James\".  One is the eldest son of a distinguished, wealthy, and historically dark family who is disowned for being different to every previous Black and going over to the other side; the other is the youngest son of a poor, historically light family who follows his elder brothers' footsteps, going into the same house his family have been in for generations, keeping up a family feud with the Malfoys. One was apparently sufficiently determined and hardworking to become an underage animagus, the other is if not stupid then certainly relatively lazy.\n\n**Harry/James**: Father and son, both quidditch players, but other than that drastically different.  Harry has inherited traits from both his parents, but I don't think he is a straight parallel for James in any way.  Harry's rivalry with Draco is because Draco is an arrogant bully; James was closer to being the arrogant bully.  Harry was raised neglected and underprivileged, not knowing of his inheritance; James was raised in a loving and privileged magical family.  James died for his family, like Harry did for his friends, sure; *but so did Lily*, and like Lily, but not James, Harry had a choice.\n\nAll of the major characters of the series are sufficiently well fleshed out that simplistic parallels are not particularly compelling; I can think of at least a few potential generational parallels (Neville/Snape, Hermione/Lily) which don't fit neatly into this scheme..."], [7, "Ok, but what are the comparisons with Ron, Hermione, and Ginny?"], [7, "I can understand the Neville/Peter comparison, but comparing all the the older generation to the younger generation, I kinda feel like you're grasping for straws."], [6, "This is the type of analysis you come up with when procrastinating to write a college paper and at 1am somewhere in between your 5th beer and 2nd cup of coffee you are suddenly hit with a moment of clarity."], [6, "I don't know if this has been posted before.

It also decreases their importance as unique characters if they are solely viewed through the lens of angels sent to right the wrongs of their predecessors.

As for Remus, he was the heart of it in a way, since much of their bond and subsequent adventures stems from the friendship Sirius and James have to him, from wanting to be there for him even as a wolf. \n\nSo, I don't know about all the parallels, though I can definitely see some; but I agree in general that Harry & co. are supposed to be an improved version of their predecessors.

Let's not think of this as a romantic way, but Hermione is the better Lily because of their intelligence. Yes, Remus is smart, but he's not a leader...if you based it off that situation alone, then Remus could fit in with Ron as well. But for now, let's focus on Hermione/Ginny/Lily.\n\n* Hermione/Lily: The reason I think Hermione reminds me more of Lily than Remus is because their intelligence and leadership. Both are not afraid to stand up to Harry/James respectively, both were the smartest muggleborn of their respective generations, and will do anything to protect Harry. When Hermione has revealed that she knows that Harry's going to die in order to destroy all the Horcruxes, Hermione wants to go with him as a form of protection, knowing that she will get killed as well, but Harry does not want her to go. In order to protect Harry from Voldemort, Lily protects her son in her arms, casting a seal of protection the moment she dies. Both women are also brave and going back to their intelligence attributes, know a variety of spells and potions that can help out in any situation.\n\n* Ginny/Lily: Just like with the Hermione/Lily, Ginny/Lily are also brave and know a variety of spells, even if Ginny's variety is more defensive. Just like Hermione/Lily, they would also do anything to protect Harry, Ginny proving this when she decides to fight Voldemort after Harry's \"death.\" But that's where the similarities end. I could put her in the Harry/James category because just like them, she's a good Quidditch player. The main reason that Ginny is paired with Lily though, is because they are very similar in looks. They both have red hair, but Lily has emerald green eyes (don't bring up the movie) while Ginny has brown eyes.\n\nAnd I find that unfair because while Hermione looks nothing like Lily, she has more in common with Lily.

Hermione was born to muggles and lived a relatively sheltered life until Hogwarts, so she avoided some of Remus' distrust of others and lack of confidence. Neville's friends teased him but still respected him and inspired him to find his inner hero, but while the rest of the Marauders were always kind to Peter I don't think they ever really treated him with the respect that Neville got.

Both of them are the best friend of the \"main\" person, Harry and James. Each of them is exceedingly loyal to his friends, but can also lack a level of maturity. Sirius was literally emotionally stunted by his imprisonment making it difficult for him to get passed things like grudges against Snape. Ron tends to be a bit limited, and we see evidence of that with comments like \"emotional range of a teaspoon,\" his petty fighting with Harry in GOF, among other things.\n\nLike I said, I don't think this is supposed to be Hermione=Remus, Ron=Sirius, but I think some fair comparisons can be made.", "id": "d8z3c4j"}, {"comment": "I personally view the Marauders as being very different from the Trio of Harry's time and peer group. \n\nFor one, you have to remember that the Mauraders grew up in a different time period.

He was still charismatic and influential enough to begin swaying the supporters of Pureblood supremacy to his side, as seen with Sirius's own testimony about his family. Sirius's own brother, Regulus, even became a Death Eater, as did Snape.\n\nFor me, Ron and Sirius may seem superficially similar on the surface. Yet Sirius is developed enough to the point where calling him 'Ron's predecessor' would be doing a disservice to both characters, and ignoring the fact that they have very different lives, backgrounds, upbringings, looks, and personalities. One of the biggest being that Ron's family never sided with Voldemort; in fact, Sirius's family, the Blacks, regarded the Weasleys as 'Muggle-loving blood traitors'.\n\nAs for Remus and Hermione, they do share more similarities than Ron and Sirius do, but again, mostly at a superficial level. Ignoring the fact that they're different genders as well, Remus, unlike Hermione, had to grow up with the stigma of being a werewolf, likely facing prejudice from his own father as well. We learned on Pottermore that Remus's father, Lyall Lupin, once was prejudiced and bigoted against werewolves, and tried to restrict and deny their rights...until Fenrir Greyback targeted and attacked Lyall's son, Remus. \n\nBecause of his father's bigotry, Remus had to suffer from not only nearly dying during a werewolf attack, but dealing with massive physical scarring, painful turnings, and facing prejudice from others for the rest of his life. He couldn't even find a proper job as an adult, and likely relied on Harry's father, James, supporting him financially, because no one wanted to hire a werewolf.\n\nHermione, by comparison, grew up in a upper-middle-class Muggle family as an only child, being the daughter of two dentists.

Hermione is the instigator of much of the trio's rulebreaking (the DA is her idea, for instance!); she never shies away from telling Ron or Harry when they are being stupid or foolhardy (e.g. the midnight duel in PS, when she's not even really friends with them and is desperately lonely), or from pushing her own ideas even when they disagree with the recieved wisdom of everyone around her (SPEW, anyone?) (in this, Hermione is more like Lily than she is like Remus, from the limited amount we see of Lily); she is probably innately crueller than Ron or Harry, while in the Marauders Era we are given the distinct impression that it is Sirius and James who are the cruel ones.\n\n**Neville/Peter**: as much as fandom likes to pretend otherwise, the Marauders are clearly a foursome, and though Peter betrayed them in the end, he was as much a part of the group as the other three while he was at school.  He was an animagus with the others, he appears in the Marauder's Map with the others.  Neville is clearly very much on the fringes of the Harry/Ron/Hermione trio; he is no more a part of their group than Ginny and Luna are.  In the final book, he stays at Hogwarts with Ginny and Luna while Harry, Ron, and Hermione go off on the camping trip of doom, despite being in their year and of age by the time they leave.\n\n**Ginny/Lily**: James is clearly infatuated with Lily for a long time before she returns his affection, this is absolutely not the case with Ginny and Harry.  As we know barely anything else about Lily, aside from the fact that like Ginny she had red hair, there's little else to base parallels on here, but (probably wealthy-ish middle-class) muggleborn vs poor pureblood, prodigy vs. talented and powerful but not at all the best witch of her generation (Harry clearly thinks that this honour goes to Hermione): Hermione shares just as many, if not more characteristics with Lily than Ginny does.\n\n**Ron/Sirius**: I'm genuinely struggling to think what the parallels here are meant to be, beyond \"best friend of Harry/James\".  One is the eldest son of a distinguished, wealthy, and historically dark family who is disowned for being different to every previous Black and going over to the other side; the other is the youngest son of a poor, historically light family who follows his elder brothers' footsteps, going into the same house his family have been in for generations, keeping up a family feud with the Malfoys. One was apparently sufficiently determined and hardworking to become an underage animagus, the other is if not stupid then certainly relatively lazy.\n\n**Harry/James**: Father and son, both quidditch players, but other than that drastically different.  Harry has inherited traits from both his parents, but I don't think he is a straight parallel for James in any way.  Harry's rivalry with Draco is because Draco is an arrogant bully; James was closer to being the arrogant bully.  Harry was raised neglected and underprivileged, not knowing of his inheritance; James was raised in a loving and privileged magical family.  James died for his family, like Harry did for his friends, sure; *but so did Lily*, and like Lily, but not James, Harry had a choice.\n\nAll of the major characters of the series are sufficiently well fleshed out that simplistic parallels are not particularly compelling; I can think of at least a few potential generational parallels (Neville/Snape, Hermione/Lily) which don't fit neatly into this scheme...", "id": "d8z8cow"}, {"comment": "Thanks for pointing out Peter Pettigrew. \n\nPeople love to just dismiss him but the four boys were a team and they were obviously close considering they made a secret map, became animagus, and helped out with Lupin's furry problem for i'm assuming all of hogwarts.

Let's not think of this as a romantic way, but Hermione is the better Lily because of their intelligence. Yes, Remus is smart, but he's not a leader...if you based it off that situation alone, then Remus could fit in with Ron as well. But for now, let's focus on Hermione/Ginny/Lily.\n\n* Hermione/Lily: The reason I think Hermione reminds me more of Lily than Remus is because their intelligence and leadership. Both are not afraid to stand up to Harry/James respectively, both were the smartest muggleborn of their respective generations, and will do anything to protect Harry. When Hermione has revealed that she knows that Harry's going to die in order to destroy all the Horcruxes, Hermione wants to go with him as a form of protection, knowing that she will get killed as well, but Harry does not want her to go. In order to protect Harry from Voldemort, Lily protects her son in her arms, casting a seal of protection the moment she dies. Both women are also brave and going back to their intelligence attributes, know a variety of spells and potions that can help out in any situation.\n\n* Ginny/Lily: Just like with the Hermione/Lily, Ginny/Lily are also brave and know a variety of spells, even if Ginny's variety is more defensive. Just like Hermione/Lily, they would also do anything to protect Harry, Ginny proving this when she decides to fight Voldemort after Harry's \"death.\" But that's where the similarities end. I could put her in the Harry/James category because just like them, she's a good Quidditch player. The main reason that Ginny is paired with Lily though, is because they are very similar in looks. They both have red hair, but Lily has emerald green eyes (don't bring up the movie) while Ginny has brown eyes.\n\nAnd I find that unfair because while Hermione looks nothing like Lily, she has more in common with Lily.

And I'm Dutch.", "id": "d1n2sph"}, {"comment": "Except Western Europeans--as well as younger liberal Americans (so pretty much reddit) *way* exaggerate how prudish the US is.  If you believe these types of people, then the US is essentially Taliban-controlled.  However, sex is very, very prevalent in movies, television, advertising, comedy, music lyrics (and music videos), and pretty much every form of media I can think of.  Hell, just go outside and look how people are dressed, and you can see how much of American dress is designed to be sexy--skinny jeans, miniskirts, low-cut shirts.  Everything, on women, designed to be as form-fitting and flattering as possible.  Go to the beach, and most women are dressed, essentially, in their underwear.  Even if they're children (and yes, bikinis *were* deliberately designed to be sexual.  Renard described them as causing an \"explosion on the beach\" drawing parallels to atomic testing on the Bikini Atoll).\n\nIf you talk to the average American, they're not afraid of sex. They don't squirm at the thought.  Mostish of reddit is American, and do people squirm at the thought of sex?  No.  Porn makes it to the front page.  \n\nNow, compare the US to *actually* prudish societies.  Essentially all of the Middle East and Northern Africa--in fact, much or even most of Africa in general (not everyone in Africa is a naked tribesman--just to get that out of the way).   And I think most of Asia in general.  China especially, but even heavily porn-producing countries like Japan have a law that makes it so they have to blur out genitals, not to mention the fact that Japan has very low rates of people actually--going out and having sex with each other, and high rates of virginity for younger folks).\n\nBut the US *does* have a reputation for prudishness--why?  Because we don't have tits on basic cable.  That's pretty much it.  I mean, fine, Americans have a thing about tits, so much that topless beaches are in decline in France because American tourists just sexualized the bare breast so much...however, bare breasts in France are still taboo in 95% of circumstances.  Americans fetishize nudity just a *little* more than Europeans do, and only because nudity is \"banned\" on television--but only on broadcast and basic cable (premium cable is full of tits).  The only reason for that is because of a vocal minority, mainly in the Bible Belt, that would freak out if they saw nudity on television, because it's teaching bad morals to our children, or something.  These are places where women only wear long skirts because wearing pants is sinful.  \n\nExacerbating this view of Americans as prudish is when even liberal Americans are shocked when they see nudity in a place that isn't expected.  But this doesn't mean those Americans think that nudity is wrong--merely that they're shocked that it happened!  For example, the famous superbowl halftime show.  The primary reaction wasn't actually \"I'm so offended!\".  It was *surpise* that that happened, amusement that it happened, and annoyance that Janet Jackson was being an attention whore, or even annoyance that this potential role model to children was showing her nipple to everyone as a form of attention.  But none of that is actual prudishness.  It's just a society unaccustomed to seeing a nipple on broadcast television seeing a nipple on broadcast television.  After enough exposure (like the increasing use of the words shit and fuck on basic cable), we'll start to stop noticing.\n\nAnd the sex ed thing--yeah it's a huge problem.  In Bible Belt states.  I was taught proper sex ed in middle school and high school.  We watched cringey videos about how periods and boners worked.  We were taught about STDs, condoms, and other forms of birth control.  The extent of \"abstinence only\" is the teacher saying \"of course, the safest form of birth control is to not have sex at all\", which is common sense, and they still taught us how to use condoms.  And I know this isn't high school, but in college, it is the norm for RAs (resident advisors...students who are \"in charge\" of dormitories) to buy condoms and leave them outside the door so anyone can use them if it's so needed, and this shit isn't controversial at all outside the Bible Belt.\n\nAnd it is all about the Bible Belt.  The US has a strong protestant prescence that doesn't exist in Europe.  Outside of that, the US is not particularly prudish, and personally I think Europeans build that up as a form of feeling superior to Americans, who they view as uncultured and generally superstitious.  But that's generally what happens with a large (size and population) country with a long history of class and/or racial problems.  The more small/urban you get (like the Netherlands or the American northeast), the fewer \"religious nuts\" you have.\n\nThat's my rant.

These people are not as big a threat to someone who can't use their wand if wands are illegal. The people who would learn to kill and would buy a wand if illegal are in the same scenario either way.\n\nUmbridge's method is strictly worse than either system. If wands are legal, then people can't defend themselves. If wands are illegal, then her method gives more people guns and the students still can't defend themselves.\n\nNow, unless the US has lessons on how to defend yourself from attacks using guns in schools, please explain to me the difference between the system there and the one Umbridge uses? \n\nAnd fyi, I wouldn't talk smack about a system that is 3 times more effective at preventing violent crime and homicide than yours.

I can see how easy it is for people to discard Ron as 'useless', but he's always had the biggest intangibles: heart, loyalty. Couldn't have been easy to be Harry's friend."], [81, "Very very inaccurate. Ron hated that sandwich "], [66, "Damnit why am I crying\n\nRon is a rock in my mind. Sure, you think he doesn't do much, but he is goddamned solid and will support those who need it. "], [61, "**First Year**: Generally people complain that he made Hermione cry and said she had no friends and other mean things. He was right though. Hermione was being a stuck up bitch and what he said was mean and rude but at the end of the day she humiliated him and he reacted like an 11 year old. But he made it up to her, he fought a troll to save her and then became her friend. At the end of the year he sacrificed himself, frankly risking death, in order that Harry and Hermione can go on with no thought to his own safety.\n\n**Second Year**: Now Ron has spent his whole life being told Slytherins are evil and parseltoungue=dark magic. Yet when his best friend is caught speaking the language and is widely believed to be Slytherins heir, being bullied in the corridors, does he abandon him? No of course not, he's too loyal. Then at the end of the year he goes to fight Slytherins monster because his friend and sister were hurt, facing death for the ones he loves. Not to mention that he's scared of spiders, his biggest fear that we later learn is on par with Dementors for Harry. So he goes and fights giant ones on the word of a friend to help another.\n\n**Third Year**: Hermione was a bitch and went behind their backs about the broom, didn't even think to mention that she went to speak to McGonagall. She was also wrong about it being cursed as much as she was right about it being from Sirius. She also was heartless about Scabbers (idgaf that he was Wormtail, she was still heartless about her cat having \"killed\" his pet). Ron again reacts normally,hurt by his friend but he can't stay mad for long and ultimately forgives her. End of the year Ron stands up to what he believes is a mass murderer \"if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill me too\". He's also there for Harry all year when a murderer is trying to kill him, not even when Sirius \"almost kills\" him with a knife in the dorms does he try and distance himself from Harry. He stands by his friend.\n\n**Fourth Year**: This is the only thing I have against him, shitty thing to do but I can still understand it, he believes Harry put his name in the Goblet. Imagine you're Ron though. You spend weeks dreaming that maybe you'll be picked for the tournament, yeah you're underage but maybe just *maybe* you'll get to shine for once publicly and do something none of your brothers got to do, make your Mum proud and hey maybe Hermione will notice...she's been getting cute lately. But nah it's your famous bff. He reacts like a normal teenager. You know what though? End of the year there's not one doubt in his mind about Harry saying that Voldemorts back despite much less evidence.\n\n**Fifth Year**: They were right not to write to him, one wrong word could have been a disaster for the Order. Harry was being a child, they were at war and couldn't risk any sensitive information being leaked. He spends the entire year supporting Harry being a little bitch, he defies the ministry and trains for the fight ahead mastering magic many adults cant do (on that note his Patronus? A dog. Loyal to a fault). End of the year he goes to fight Death Eaters at the ministry because his friend had a dream and he knew fighting Voldemort (who he thought would be there) was the right thing to do.\n\n**Sixth Year**: He is nothing but a good friend. He even does the mature thing and hooks up with Lavender because he accepts nothings happening with Hermione. Also, at this point he knows his best friend is prophesied to kill or be killed by the most powerful dark wizard in history. Does he run away? Nope, he duels said dark wizards followers at the end of the year and pledges his loyalty to Harry on what seems like an impossible mission.\n\n**Seventh Year**: So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great. \n\nBy this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, (this is especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick). If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue. \n\nThen the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them. \n\nHe eventually comes back, after being completely off the hook, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. The scenes with the mirror in The Philosophers Stone, when Harry catches him sneaking out to practice Quidditch and the horcrux lays out every problem with Ron perfectly; his insecurities about his family, not being good enough for his mother, the girl he loves preferring his friend, being the weak member of the group. The Horcrux then throws all this and more back at him...so he stabs it in the face. Because he has finally realised he *is* good enough, that he does have value and that he should be happy with who he is. \n\nWe also see a notable change in him from this point on. He is much more confidant and calm, he gets Hermione and is able to be possibly the most valuable he has been in the entire series. \n\nHe then goes on to help destroy 2/3 remaining horcruxes, fights in the Battle of Hogwarts and is one of only three people to directly stare down Voldemort and defy him (\"He beat you\") and continues to fight for what is right, even knowing Harry is dead and being one of only two people who knew the prophecy he actually thought the fight was futile at that point but he kept going because *it was the right thing to do*.\n\nRon is the heart of the trio, he's the only one who shows true character growth in a realistic manner. Sure he makes mistakes but he overcomes them and ultimately becomes a better person for it. He can be insensitive at times but he more than makes up for it by being the most loyal and decent person in the series.\n"], [57, "Ron is a Hufflepuff \n\nHermione is a Ravenclaw \n\nHarry is a Slytherin\n\nThey were all put in to Gryffindor because they asked to.

", "id": "cybh9ye"}], [{"comment": "**First Year**: Generally people complain that he made Hermione cry and said she had no friends and other mean things. He was right though. Hermione was being a stuck up bitch and what he said was mean and rude but at the end of the day she humiliated him and he reacted like an 11 year old. But he made it up to her, he fought a troll to save her and then became her friend. At the end of the year he sacrificed himself, frankly risking death, in order that Harry and Hermione can go on with no thought to his own safety.\n\n**Second Year**: Now Ron has spent his whole life being told Slytherins are evil and parseltoungue=dark magic. Yet when his best friend is caught speaking the language and is widely believed to be Slytherins heir, being bullied in the corridors, does he abandon him? No of course not, he's too loyal. Then at the end of the year he goes to fight Slytherins monster because his friend and sister were hurt, facing death for the ones he loves. Not to mention that he's scared of spiders, his biggest fear that we later learn is on par with Dementors for Harry. So he goes and fights giant ones on the word of a friend to help another.\n\n**Third Year**: Hermione was a bitch and went behind their backs about the broom, didn't even think to mention that she went to speak to McGonagall. She was also wrong about it being cursed as much as she was right about it being from Sirius. She also was heartless about Scabbers (idgaf that he was Wormtail, she was still heartless about her cat having \"killed\" his pet). Ron again reacts normally,hurt by his friend but he can't stay mad for long and ultimately forgives her. End of the year Ron stands up to what he believes is a mass murderer \"if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill me too\". He's also there for Harry all year when a murderer is trying to kill him, not even when Sirius \"almost kills\" him with a knife in the dorms does he try and distance himself from Harry. He stands by his friend.\n\n**Fourth Year**: This is the only thing I have against him, shitty thing to do but I can still understand it, he believes Harry put his name in the Goblet. Imagine you're Ron though. You spend weeks dreaming that maybe you'll be picked for the tournament, yeah you're underage but maybe just *maybe* you'll get to shine for once publicly and do something none of your brothers got to do, make your Mum proud and hey maybe Hermione will notice...she's been getting cute lately. But nah it's your famous bff. He reacts like a normal teenager. You know what though? End of the year there's not one doubt in his mind about Harry saying that Voldemorts back despite much less evidence.\n\n**Fifth Year**: They were right not to write to him, one wrong word could have been a disaster for the Order. Harry was being a child, they were at war and couldn't risk any sensitive information being leaked. He spends the entire year supporting Harry being a little bitch, he defies the ministry and trains for the fight ahead mastering magic many adults cant do (on that note his Patronus? A dog. Loyal to a fault). End of the year he goes to fight Death Eaters at the ministry because his friend had a dream and he knew fighting Voldemort (who he thought would be there) was the right thing to do.\n\n**Sixth Year**: He is nothing but a good friend. He even does the mature thing and hooks up with Lavender because he accepts nothings happening with Hermione. Also, at this point he knows his best friend is prophesied to kill or be killed by the most powerful dark wizard in history. Does he run away? Nope, he duels said dark wizards followers at the end of the year and pledges his loyalty to Harry on what seems like an impossible mission.\n\n**Seventh Year**: So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great. \n\nBy this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, (this is especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick). If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue. \n\nThen the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them. \n\nHe eventually comes back, after being completely off the hook, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. The scenes with the mirror in The Philosophers Stone, when Harry catches him sneaking out to practice Quidditch and the horcrux lays out every problem with Ron perfectly; his insecurities about his family, not being good enough for his mother, the girl he loves preferring his friend, being the weak member of the group. The Horcrux then throws all this and more back at him...so he stabs it in the face. Because he has finally realised he *is* good enough, that he does have value and that he should be happy with who he is. \n\nWe also see a notable change in him from this point on.

If anything, the opposite.", "id": "cybn045"}, {"comment": "I think you may have a misunderstanding of what privilege means in the context of backgrounds and diversity. The idea of privilege is absolutely essential in the books' themes of combatting \"racism\". By definition, privilege is an advantage that an individual or group of individuals have that are not enjoyed by most. In this case, having pure wizarding blood gave Ron certain privileges that Muggleborns, Muggles, and other magical creatures did not have. One of his privileges being exercised was choosing to be friends with, and stand up for, Muggleborns, making him a powerful ally in the fight against magical racism.\n\nIf it helps put the idea of privilege in perspective, I saw a story recently about a black woman who went grocery shopping with her white friend and experienced discrimination. Her friend had checked out first and paid with a check, no problem. When the black woman's turn came to pay with a check with the same cashier, she was made to show multiple forms of ID and wait for her checking account to be verified. She complied without question because she knew that if she protested, she would appear to the cashier and the people in line behind her as one of \"those\", an Overly Offended Black Person and possibly further reinforce a negative stereotype. Her white friend, however, had the privilege of not worrying about such things, and came back, asked the cashier to bring the manager over, and asked why she (the white person) was able to pay with check without question but the black lady behind her had to jump through all of these hoops. The people in line jumped in when they saw (from their POV, not knowing the two women were friends) someone defending a minority and corroborated what was going on. The white women's privilege gave her more credibility, which she was able to use for a good thing.\n\nIn that story, privilege was used by an ally in further the cause of ending judgement of people due to their backgrounds, but please privilege also grants the privileged the choice to close their eyes and not consciously speak out. The fact that Ron made the harder choice  speaks a lot to his character, and helps set up the themes of anti-discrimination to the books.", "id": "cybs27g"}, {"comment": "The system didn't favour the Weasly family, even though your argument states that they should have that favoured status..

For instance, he admits in HBP that he knew instantly that the diary was a horcrux, but he didn't even tell Harry that at the time. I think if word got out that Dumbledore knew so much, Voldemort would have gone into defense mode and would have increased the protection around his horcruxes or moved them.\n\nThat said, I'm almost sure that dumbledore gave Hagrid a little private tutoring when he had the time over the years (why else would Dumbledore fix Hagrid's wand).

With Bellatrix already suspicious as fuck about Snape and her looming behind him egging him on, that was the most critical point in the series where Snape had to demonstrate his supposed loyalty to Voldemort. Not only that, but as stated by Dumbledore himself in book 1, Harry would never be able to defeat Voldemort so long as Dumbledore lived because he just cared too damn much to send the kid to his death (or as Harry thought, at the time, to simply risk himself at all) to not intervene.
