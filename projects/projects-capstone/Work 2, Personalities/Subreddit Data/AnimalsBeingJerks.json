They account for only about 1-3 deaths a year. Likewise fatal auto accidents involving moose are fairly rare. Transport Canada reports a median of 20 or so fatal auto accidents with moose per year, and about 2,000 total auto accidents with moose per year. I can't find equivalent US DoT numbers, but they did say that moose account for less that 6% of wildlife-vehicle fatalities in the US, of which there are roughly 120-150 per year. So the US adds maybe another 10 deaths from moose.\n\nIn comparison dogs account for 200-300 deaths per year in the US alone. And cows account for another couple hundred.

Boxers originated in Germany, thus the Anglicized meaning of \"boxer\" most certainly was not the reasoning behind the name. It's not officially known where the name originated, but Wikipedia has some theories:\n\n> German linguistic and historical evidence find the earliest written source for the word Boxer in the 18th century, where it is found in a text in the Deutsches Fremdw\u00f6rterbuch (The German Dictionary of Foreign Words),[28] which cites an author named Mus\u00e4us of 1782 writing \"da\u00df er aus Furcht vor dem gro\u00dfen Baxer Salmonet ... sich auf einige Tage in ein ger\u00e4umiges Packfa\u00df ... absentiret hatte\". At that time the spelling \"baxer\" equalled \"boxer\". Both the verb (boxen [English \"to box, to punch, to jab\"]) and the noun (Boxer) were common German words as early as the late 18th century. The term Boxl, also written Buxn or Buchsen in the Bavarian dialect, means \"short (leather) trousers\" or \"underwear\". The very similar-sounding term Boxerl, also from the Bavarian dialect, is an endearing term for Boxer.[29] More in line with historical facts, Brace states that there exist many other theories to explain the origin of the breed name, from which he favors the one claiming the smaller Bullenbeisser (Brabanter) were also known as \"Boxl\" and that Boxer is just a corruption of that word.[29]", "id": "cznrlqu"}, {"comment": ">\"Boxers are descendants of extinct bullenbaiser breeds crossed with mastiff, bulldog and possibly Great Dane and even a terrier.

They wouldn't be 'free' because no domestic cow would survive in the wild.  Holstiens, for example will DIE if you don't milk them every day while they are lactating.  And the argument of 'let the calf drink the mother's milk' is ignorant.  Dairy cows as they exist today produce far too much milk for a single (or even twin) calves, and if they do not somehow get rid of the excess milk in their udder, they will reabsorb it, which will make the cow sick, and is ultimately fatal.\n\nSure, they are being raised for the slaughter - but they get to *live*.  They get to eat, sleep, smell, wander, moo as loud as they can, run, jump and hang out with members of their herd...  they are protected from predation, kept happy (unhappy cows get depressed and sick and are not economically viable) and generally have it real easy.\n\nEnter people that criticize farmers for being cruel or heartless for raising animals for human consumption.  The stigma that has grown over the years has pushed kids away from wanting to take over family or small-scale ranching operations and thrust the industry into the hands of so called 'factory' farms.  With more animals, each animal can be less productive while the operation as a whole still turns a profit.  The most effective method of making a cow more productive is making it happier and less exposed to stressors.\n\nIn short, it is the bleeding hearts that are fucking cows over, not farmers.  And the snowball effect of pushing animal ranching into the hands of corporations and away from individuals is getting pretty fucking intense.  As time goes on you will see less small farms due to this stigmatic paradigm, and at the same time you'll be tasting more and more unhappiness in your burgers.\n\nNobody loves animals more than a farmer.  Nobody.", "id": "d6wzgjr"}, {"comment": "Cows have no need to exist at the scale that they currently do. We do not need billions of cows, and as an aside it's actually terrible for the environment. \n\nBut the main point is the humaneness of 'allowing' these animals to exist only so we can kill them for our unnecessary product. And I obviously can't ask the cows what they want, but I know if it were the case for humans, dogs, or cats, I would MUCH rather prefer for a few million to exist for their own purposes rather than a few billion to exist only as objects to be slaughtered to satisfy someone else's selfish whims. \n\nCows do exist, peacefully and without being a 'product' on millions of sanctuaries around the world. They have calves, they live normal happy lives, and they are cared for by owners and guardians who actually care about them rather than using them as a product. The decisions about their health, food, life, etc are made with their best interests in mind - not money or self-interest. That's how cows should exist.\n\nI personally would make similar objections if someone was repeatedly breeding dogs, keeping them while they're cute puppies or whatever reason, and then having them euthanized at the vet. And euthanization is WAY less cruel than what happens in even the most well-regulated slaughterhouse. \n\nIf farmers actually cared about cows, they would allow the calves to remain and nurse from their mothers. Sure, perhaps there would be excess milk to be milked - and that's fine for humans to milk them in that case, since it's for the cows own benefit. But that's not what happens - so it's a little disingenuous to claim that you're doing this because you have to. \n\nThe best thing for cows (and for the planet!) is to exist as pets and on sanctuaries. To act like you're doing some wonderful favor to them is an insult to everyone's intelligence - you raise and ultimately slaughter cows for your own self-interest.... your food preferences and your livelihood. \n\nAs for the 'unhappiness' in my burger - I don't eat meat, which must be pretty clear from what I've written here. But you and I both know that small scale farmers who provide the optimal living conditions for cattle are a sub-1% portion of the beef and dairy market. It's not us who are causing that to happen - it's the desire to eat more and more meat, in ridiculous quantities that's making it that way. With so much demand for cheap, plentiful meat, factory farming is going to exist. \n\nIf you want small scale, non-factory farmed meat and dairy to flourish and reclaim market share, EVERY American (and westerner) needs to eat way less dairy and meat.

Iguanas have a lot of rather small but sharp teeth. They use them to chop up the vegetation that they eat, but they're pretty effective at chopping up any kind of soft tissue that's thin enough, and our skin is on that list. They aren't a small lizard and a large one has a big enough mouth and strong enough muscles to give a pretty strong bite and bury those teeth as deep as they can go.\n\nThe teeth are quite small, so they don't penetrate too far, but it is far enough to cause damage to connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerves in places such as your hand, wrist, or fingers (these are places with little to no muscle tissue). Your face is also covered in soft, biteable bits that poke straight out of it.\n\nThe real problem is when you try to remove your appendage from the animal. They might let go, or they might not. Sometimes they hold on until they no longer feel agitated, or you repel them with chemicals. Their death also helps with this but that's :( \n\nIf you pull to quickly you will drag the teeth and they'll tear at your tissue, this can greatly exacerbate the damage. The teeth can be left behind as, like all reptiles, they have simple teeth that can easily fall out. Because the teeth are so small, they can get left in the wound and, if not properly cleaned, can also result in an infection.\n\nSo in short, the bite really can be that bad, but you're also correct to worry about infection.\n\n**EDIT** [Here are some images of iguana teeth](http://reptile-parrots.com/forums/showthread.php/114-Iguana-Bite-wounds-Very-graphic) (scroll down some) They're small, bladed, and serrated and look a lot like [ankylosaur](http://www.dreamworlds.org/DSC06868asm.jpg) teeth.

His grandma released them into her garden, starting a big ecological problem. \n\nNot the point of this post, but to any who read this; if you have pets not native to the place you live, whether they are fish, invertebrates, birds, even plants or whatever, never release them because you think they might be better in the wild.

It probably did not require that much adaptation, since the behavior to graze/hunt at that location was already there.\n\nOrdinarily, herons and kingfishers lie in wait for fish, watching them, striking when the time is right. The birds likely learned the behavior by first watching fish accumulate around floating bread, and having more fishing success in those situations. They probably watched people throw bread into the water, or watched crumbs catch the wind and blow into the water, and eventually figured out they could physically pick up the bread and place it in the water.

Not at all.\n\nThat Tiger was really angry, what you see is a defensive threat.\n\nThe body language of Tigers is similar to other cats. (Though it does not necessarily follow that of a domestic cat!)\n\nFirst notice the tail - always watch the tail of cats first. It is one of the easiest parts of the body to spot the mood. See how the tail is held low and lashed from side to side? - clear sign of a pissed off cat that is about to go full business.\n\nNext stop head. The ears are laid back (back of the ears face forward), bared teeth (\"show your weapons\"), nose is wrinkled and the eyes are narrowed. \n\nSo why is it on the ground then? Because for Tigers there is a difference between offensive threats and defensive threats. Basically offensive is more \"come at me bro\" (here the Tiger would not lay low, but stand up with the ears erect - at least before the hitting starts and the mouth is mostly a slit at the beginning) and defensive is \"I won't jump you, but if you jump me I mean business and will fuck your shit up.\"\n\nAlso generally a (big) cat pressing the itself to the floor, lashing the tail and making low roars is a big sign of aggression, not submission.\n\nThese instinctive reactions happen fast. Notice how when the Tiger is woken up it *is* standing up and doing the offensive threat thing, but then probably realises that the other one is bigger/stronger/more dangerous and while still pissed off, doesn't want to escalate, so she switches to defensive threat, the other Tiger realises he done goofed and backs up. \n\n\nSource: I kinda loved all kinds of animals ever since I was young, went on some safaris and spend way too much time in Zoos looking, filming and drawing all kinds of animals.", "id": "d1znsb5"}, {"comment": "It's easier to chomp down on a throat and wind pipe from the bottom.", "id": "d1zroki"}, {"comment": "chomp up?", "id": "d1zw97q"}, {"comment": "Yea, seems easier to explode at its adversary when crouched low.

Repeat above steps until they are comfortable with the noise. \n\nWhat kind of dog are you thinking of getting? \n\nAs far as stopping them from doing something, you'll need to train a leave it command.

They won't know the word right away so they will try to sniff, eat, or lunge at the food.

However, you're not going to get that discussion going by name-calling and insulting the other party. \n\nAlso, the study I linked to calculates that un-owned cats (defined as \"farm/barn cats, strays that are fed by humans but not granted access to habitations, cats in subsidized colonies and cats that are completely feral\") are responsible for about 89 percent of those kills. So, even if all the pople who let their pet cat go outside stopped doing that right now, the numbers wouldn't drop all that much. \n\nOn the other hand, [the raw data for the study](http://www.nature.com/article-assets/npg/ncomms/journal/v4/n1/extref/ncomms2380-s1.pdf) shows that even pet cats that are allowed outside have significantly lower hunting rates than un-owned cats. So, anyone who adopts a stray cat actually helps lower the risk for wildlife.\n\nThus, if your aim is to do something about the issue (instead of using it as an excuse to vent about how much you hate cats and their owners), you should support any organization that aims to reduce the number of strays, and you should applaud anyone who takes in a stray cat.

Irrespective of that, the 11% you cited from the nature article is still pretty far from insignificant and domestic outdoor cats are clearly contributing to the problem. Adopting a stray cat isn't helping, if you're adopting through a shelter it's not like that cat is ever going to make it back onto the streets (thankfully they're put down like the shitty creatures they are at most shelters). Controlling stray numbers through culling them would be far more effective than hoping a few get adopted directly off the street. There is simply no justification for having an outdoor cat. I've watched my rabbits killed by cats, and I've found countless dead parrots around my bird bath after new neighbours with an outdoor cat moved in. My other neighbour's dog lost an eye after a cat came into the yard and picked a fight. You can't say \"oh but the stray cats are the major issue so outdoor cats are fine!\" when there are still another 760 million to 2.6 billion animals killed every year in your country by owned cats, in addition to the nuisance they can present to other neighbours. The solution is pretty simple, have programs to control feral and stray cat populations through culling, and stop letting people have outdoor cats. If you can't find a way to confine your cat to your own backyard then it shouldn't be outside at all. \n\nWhere I live there are already several areas where outdoor cats are banned and [there is a push to make this a more national strategy along with increased culling efforts on feral cat populations](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/push-for-24hour-cat-curfew-to-protect-native-animals-20150727-giloew.html).

The puppy though, has loved my cat as soon as he saw him. He often tries to copy my cat and often jumps on parts of the furniture where my cat has been because he thinks that because the cat does it, he has to do that too.\n\nIt makes me really sad that these two will never get along because of a lack of communication :c It always makes me sad seeing a cat and a dog not get along because it is usually because their body language is so conflicting.", "id": "d18cii7"}], [{"comment": "Why would you let a cat get that fat?", "id": "d4dl08t"}], [{"comment": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV3tLQ2uGzs", "id": "d14t1mv"}], [{"comment": "Oops! haha...source?", "id": "d14wnlc"}], [{"comment": "I just want to slap the owner.

Even though he pretty much just banged his teeth into my leg, I had one heck of a puncture would from his fang/canine tooth.\n\nWhen I started hollering (which I rarely did), and Grimm (the fawn) figured out he bit me, he immediately rolled over...and jetted \"low-rider\" style out of the room.  a 175 lbs dog slinking out of the room is hilarious.\n\nHe knew I was so pissed at him, that he spent the next 8 hours trying to butter up to me.  after a while I finally gave in...\n\nFrom then on out, I fed the dogs in separate rooms.  Probably not the best solution...but it worked.", "id": "d3lrfbf"}, {"comment": "I've always had 3 or 4 big dogs around and I've been lucky that none of them have that trait.

I've also got a Scottish Terrier (Stirling, 18 months old) and he's so loving and playful and tries to be in control with Darwin who just humours him most of the time. They have a really interesting dynamic. Darwin can be so moody and it took almost there years and getting Stirling to turn him from being quite aloof but demanding and manipulative to being quite a loving dog but it's almost as if he's embarrassed to come close and be scratched etc. whereas Stirling is lying on my pillow with his head resting on my head right now after giving me morning kisses (Darwin sometimes deigns to come and stand on me and begrudgingly lick my face once of a morning). The usual methods of dog training didn't really work with Darwin (I have a Zoology degree and study a Master's in Animal Behaviour, so set about applying positive reinforcement from the start which he just didn't agree with - they just act out and push every boundary the same as if you lock them in a fenced in garden they test the perimeter) and we arrived at basically me talking to him like he's a person, which he pretty much is and just being more tuned in to what he's trying to communicate. It's been hard work and sometimes we fall out and aren't really speaking for a few hours or a day, just like with people, but we always make up. He's just not a dog and I love that about him.

My dad and his mates were being 30 year old delinquents/investigating around some of the industrial parts of town one night because one of the business owners had screwed them over. I don't think they found what they were looking for, but they found a tiny, only maybe a couple of months old, clearly mistreated pup chained up outside a factory inside the locked area of the industrial complex. Thinking these arseholes were mistreating it and probably trying to train it up to be an attack dog (and maybe for dog fights cos that's the kid of crap that goes on in my area), my dad, well, 'liberated' him and took him home. \n\n\nHe grew up to be a fiercely loyal dog. Super smart and *super* cheeky. He respected my dad as the leader of the pack and I think he thought of my mother as 'lesser member in the pack' but was very loving. I think the malamute side of his nature must have kicked in when my sister and I were born as he was very protective of us and was a fucking *great* babysitter. My dad was our more engaged parent and our stay-at-home mum so I think that helped with that kind of bonding.\n\nOur parents *always* fostered the attitude of teaching us kids how to behave around dogs/animals, understanding that pet dogs more often than not don't just bite - they respond if you pull on their ears and tail! - but Axel was very playful and as we got older (like 3 or 4) he'd relaxed a bit and knew he was still, beta, I guess, to my dad's alpha in the pack and didn't have to fight for it, and so he put up with a fair bit from us kids and loved playing with us. Dad would take my sister and I on bike rides and Axel would come too. The four of us were a great little pack.   \n\n\nDad raised and trained him very well and I think he had the best parts of both his Husky and Malamute stereotypical natures - fiercely loyal and loving, paternal, a big ol' fan of pack dynamics, but still cheeky and had such a personality, and would make his own damn decisions if he felt like it, and was *very* smart. Huskies are not higher maintenance dogs just because of their size/exercise needs - they've *got* to be well trained and have good relationship with their owners! \n\n\nMy dad went out late at night once and I can't remember why he did, but because he was walking, Axel got out and followed my dad and he didn't realise it because the dog was sneaky and probably just wanted to make sure his alpha wasn't getting up to mischief (which I absolutely dare say my dad *was*) and was hit by a car and died. It was devastating, and I still miss him. I was only maybe 5 or 6 when he died. It took us a few years to get over it enough to get another dog. I was 9 when my parents surprised me with rescuing a 3~ year old dog. He's 15 now, and kicking me in the back as I type this. He's been with me through everything, and I took him when I moved out, of course. He's a mutt with staffy, sausage, and ridgeback in him. Fuck he's funny looking.\n\n\nDogs are magical!!! \n\n\ntl;dr: (mostly irrelevant) reminiscing about family childhood dog.

Fuck he's funny looking.\n\n\nOh staffies are the best dogs I've ever encountered. We have a 12 year old Staffy, and she is amazingly intelligent. She'll pretend to want out to piss/shit, run out, go around my dad's car (the exit is through our garage) and then run back inside expecting a treat (she gets one if she goes quickly, normally she dawdles around). She also absolutely loves attention and will make monkey noises to get petted if you aren't paying enough attention to her. \n\nBest of all though, she loves to sit on our back deck and sunbathe during the spring/summer months. She's learned to open the deck door (which is pretty loose when unlocked) by headbutting it, and will often push it open and sit in the doorway just to get a breeze. It's not too warm right now though, so my dad kept the door locked this morning. My dog however decided the door needed to be open. So she headbutted it and when it wouldn't open, she turned to my dad and cried. He told her \"no!\" And so she went up to him and wagged her tail expecting pets. He petted her for a bit and when he stopped, she walked back over to the door, wagged her tail and starting whining again. Again he told her \"no!\" So again she went over and wagged her tail, got pets and repeated the process again. My dad was amazed; she's mastered the art of buttering someone up to get what she wants. \n\nOne of the scariest days of my life was when we thought we were going to lose her to a respiratory infection a few months ago.

The usual methods of dog training didn't really work with Darwin (I have a Zoology degree and study a Master's in Animal Behaviour, so set about applying positive reinforcement from the start which he just didn't agree with - they just act out and push every boundary the same as if you lock them in a fenced in garden they test the perimeter) and we arrived at basically me talking to him like he's a person, which he pretty much is and just being more tuned in to what he's trying to communicate.

If you're saying \"doggo family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Doggodaemous, which includes things from sub woofers to birdos to sharkos (the glub glub kind not the bork bork kind).

A crate is a training tool that enables dogs to have a \"safe space\" or den for themselves to sleep in. They're not meant to be tools for punishment, either. I have one for my dogs and I catch them going in there to nap all the time. They know it's their little space to go and be alone where the other dogs, or me, won't bother them. They also like to hide out in them whenever I'm doing something that annoys them, like vacuuming, which helps me immensely because I don't have little dog stumpers to trip over while cleaning.\n\nThe only times in recent memory that I've actually had to close the gate on the crate was a night where one of my dogs had a back leg injury and I didn't want him making it worse over night. So I gave him some doggy medicine to help the pain + help him sleep and crated him overnight so he would have minimal movement. He spent the night zonked out and woke up the next morning feeling better.\n\nAs a properly used tool, crates are fine. I don't get where so many people got the idea that they're just big cages you force your dog to be alone in all day and night so they don't bother you. How is it any better to force a dog to be locked in a single room all day, or in a tiny run in a back yard or chained up to a tree with minimal movement available?

I didn't know the dog, my dog certainly didn't know the dog, and I wasn't sure how each dog would respond. Thank god my dog was great about it, but that was absolutely not an ideal situation. Meanwhile, the owner of the other dog was just sitting there saying \"oh don't worry, my dog is super friendly\". Fuck you lady, I don't know if my dog is friendly, and even if she is friendly she's in a new situation with a new owner and there's a big dog charging up to her.

Sometimes when we're on a walk I'm trying to work with my dog on leash behavior or some other skill. I can't do that when other dogs run up and try to instigate play time. I make it a point to go places with leash laws specifically because that's the environment that's best for my dog and what we're trying to do together. It takes a real asshole not to respect that leash laws aren't just for their dog.\n\nTo the people who say \"well my dog is trained, she/he stays by me and always listens to commands\". That's great that you think that, but unfortunately dogs are still animals. All it takes is a half-second of unintentional disobedience for them to accidentally get on the street and get hit by a car. It takes a half second of distraction from the owner to miss the signal that their dog wants to go play with another dog.

A crate is a training tool that enables dogs to have a \"safe space\" or den for themselves to sleep in. They're not meant to be tools for punishment, either. I have one for my dogs and I catch them going in there to nap all the time. They know it's their little space to go and be alone where the other dogs, or me, won't bother them. They also like to hide out in them whenever I'm doing something that annoys them, like vacuuming, which helps me immensely because I don't have little dog stumpers to trip over while cleaning.\n\nThe only times in recent memory that I've actually had to close the gate on the crate was a night where one of my dogs had a back leg injury and I didn't want him making it worse over night. So I gave him some doggy medicine to help the pain + help him sleep and crated him overnight so he would have minimal movement. He spent the night zonked out and woke up the next morning feeling better.\n\nAs a properly used tool, crates are fine. I don't get where so many people got the idea that they're just big cages you force your dog to be alone in all day and night so they don't bother you. How is it any better to force a dog to be locked in a single room all day, or in a tiny run in a back yard or chained up to a tree with minimal movement available?

I don't know if the dog culture is different in NYC, but they usually split the park in two. One side for larger dogs, and one side for smaller. If the small dog park is empty, I usually see owners of aggressive dogs take their dogs to that side of the park.

Usually she pauses, stares back for a few seconds, and then gives up, walking slowly up to me with a little whine as if to say 'ok, dad, I know, my bad, sorry'.\n\nMind you, I do have a weirdo for a cat. Not only would she **never** try to steal fish like this, she wouldn't even eat it if I took a chunk off and put it in her bowl as a treat.

Conditioning sure, it's aware the human tends to act aggressive in this situation. But is that really learning, or just response to stimuli?

They are anything but abused.\n\nBut when they're being bad, they still get defensive because they know they'll get squirted/bopped. Personally, I assume they continue their naughtiness because of intermittent reinforcement: I don't always punish them for doing stuff (because I'm not always there when it happens), so they think maybe this time they can get away with it. But if Amelia is on my desk or trying to eat a piece of plastic, and I pick up the squirt bottle, she closes her eyes and does helmet ears, and then jumps down. Not because she's abused, but because that's her instinctual response to incoming unpleasantness.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that cats aren't really tame. Not in the way that dogs are: and even dogs fight against their instincts in order to be with us. So a cat may react in that manner without having been abused.

It's tough, because cats are so quirky that there's not really one blanket solution for discipline.\n\nAmelia loves chewing on squishy/crinkly plastic. Especially those white suede-like charge cords. I tried coating the cord in lemon juice/essential oils she didn't like, tried covering them or keeping them out of her reach, but she'd still find a way. After my third ipad charger, I finally gave up and just let her have the broken one. She hasn't bitten my chargers at all since then, and that ratty old cord is one of her favorite toys.\n\nBlaster used to crinkle plastic bags (like would grab a grocery bag from the garbage and carry it into my room to crinkle it), because he knew it would wake me up, and I'd go to the bathroom and thus might pet him. I tried locking him into the living room, but he started really liking that (a whole room to himself! Yay!) and started crinkling bags to get me to close him into the living room. What ended up working was just refusing to pet/isolate him when he'd do that. I also decided to make a point of giving him extra cuddles before bed and during the day.\n\nI dunno. Call me sentimental, but I think animals are a lot like kids. It's not about forcing them into or out of a specific behavior because that's what you, the master, want; it's more about addressing the issues at the heart of a behavior (really liking a particular chew feel, wanting attention) in a manner that suits everyone.", "id": "d1o67am"}, {"comment": "Mine chews cords too.

I keep my place at ~72 all winter but cats love heat) and WILL. NOT. BE. DISSUADED.  Loud noises. Spray bottle. Putting him in his cat carrier cage. Bopping him. Double sided tape. Blocking it off. The works. I'm considering getting a heating pad to test that theory, but he'd probably chew the cord off \n\nHe used to be extremely annoying at night. I started by locking him out, but at like 5 am when he is hungry he started pushing the door so it bounced back and forth in the latch (smart little fucker).  I ended up leaning something heavy against it so he couldn't push it.  The root of it was me feeding him when I got up.  It ended for good when I bought an automated feeder (I'm no longer master of food, just treats) but I still have to lock him out at night.  \n\nHe has also trained me to give him a treat at night.

My cats have a few cat-friendly hidey places (a bottom drawer that's not used for anything, the storage area underneath a table that's got a cloth over it), so they don't get into my cords as much - but they never really chewed on the bigger cables anyway, so I'm not sure how applicable it would be to your situation.\n\nYour best bet is honestly probably to find a way to give him what he wants (a warm, dark, hidey hole with fun chewy strings!) and hope that it dissuades him from messing with your stuff.\n\nAmelia has sort of co-trained me into giving her treats. She'll roll around on the floor, squeaky and being unbearably cute, and when I stand up to go pet her, she'll run to the corner of my bed (her \"treat spot\") and look at me expectantly.

The boy riding the pig was 2 feet from the ground and not about to be smooshed underneath an animal that literally weighs a ton. It's not about gender, it's a completely different situation.

", "id": "d6fzopd"}, {"comment": "Politely I disagree and have worked with both, with children.  Again the surface was soft mud, outside of water or a certain amount of snow, you have a safe surface.  Having fallen on all of those I would pick soft mud.  The kids legs were so short as to be above the stomach so they were likely to be pinned until the roll started.The softness would reduce bone damage.  Mom could have yelled get off as soon as the belly hit the ground, but to think that the pony might have continued after he felt the kids leg under neath is not how animals work.  They respond, and a horse responds away, you can move a horse with one finger, especially one that seasoned.  Yes, I agree there might have been an accident, but again I would take that pony and kid out tomorrow and repeat the same thing, you bet that kid learned her lesson.  You can't live a life of always going to the least risk, or I guess you can and be miserable for the rest of your life, always second guessing.  I am willing to extend some risks for the return.  I wonder how many people on this thread actually understand the pros of the risk, as well as the cons?  I see both, I know intimately what the pros are.  I have seen horses save people from mistakes  many times more that I have seen them hurt .  I have felt thankful they had a brains to help when I needed it. Trust that he felt her little leg, and the good herd dog got in front he would have reacted if the mom didn't.  Trust, patience, they taught me that the first time I dropped the reins and closed my eyes.  It is taught all through the years of horsemanship. You take away the AIDS  one by one until there is nothing left but trust and balances and challenges. All those moments, of trust, hours, days till you just have that moment that Malcolm Gladwell talked about where first glance is the truest.  I don't know if I can make it clearer.   Experience, good and bad can't be duplicated yet.  It is to chaotic for us to model. You never know somethings, so we are already on chances doorstep. You just act.  \nBy the way a poster in another thread talked about risking his life getting a large swine off of a work partner yesterday.  All large animals are dangerous, which is why I only keep one hog.  They scare me a little. But boys and some girls like to ride anything.  Sheep are fun.", "id": "d6ghfya"}, {"comment": "Crushed?

My mom used to own a pet store when I was little and the store had a golden macaw that was ~20 years old named Barney. This bird was a dick of the highest caliber but god was that bird funny. The woman that worked in the store was this tiny Irish Maria who swore with greater efficiency than probably anyone else I've ever met and taught Barney the art of a well dropped F-bomb. \n\nOne of his first words I guess was cracker (unsurprisingly) but sometimes Barney would get a treat that wasn't a cracker and would be corrected by being told \"not a cracker\". Well either Barney was a racist or this was just unfortunate but we had a black family come in one day looking for a dog and while the husband was looking at Barney he belts out \"NOT A CRACKER, NOT A CRACKER\" and absolutely stuns the man. \n\nOther notable sayings included \"YOU'RE UGLY\" \"I LOVE YOU\" \"I HATE YOU\" \"I'M NOT BARNEY\", \"YOU'RE BARNEY\", \"PEEKABOO\", \"BITCH\", \"NO FRIENDS\", and my personal favorite \"UNION\"\n\nTl;dr   My family had a pet store with a golden macaw that would curse and laugh, occasional and occasionally say borderline racist things to customers, but he was really good with dogs.\n\nedit: some other Barney stories\n\nBarney also loved my father, he would stop in every once in a while and before he did anything else would give Barney his little bird treats. After a while whenever Barney felt like ignored we'd get \"WHERE'S BOB!? CAW MISS BOB! BOB, WHERE'S BOB!?\"\n\nBarney was surprisingly good with puppies though. Barney would jump down into the little pen we had that was full of puppies and let them chase him while he laughed and shrieked obscenities at the little puppies. He'd happily bite a person that was bothering him but would only ever nip at the shiny dog tags on the puppies collars. Cat's on the other hand he hated.\n\nWhen I was about 9 I was trying to put a bag of dog food on some flimsy metal shelf and the shelf broke and I wound up underneath both it and the bag, and before I could get up Barney starts cawing \"CAW YOU FUCKED UP, YOU FUCKED, CAW YOU FUCKED UP\". And when I finally got up and got mad at Barney and yelled at him to shut up all I got back was \"I DON'T WORK HERE, CAW I DON'T WORK HERE!\".

Well either Barney was a racist or this was just unfortunate but we had a black family come in one day looking for a dog and while the husband was looking at Barney he belts out \"NOT A CRACKER, NOT A CRACKER\" and absolutely stuns the man. \n\nOther notable sayings included \"YOU'RE UGLY\" \"I LOVE YOU\" \"I HATE YOU\" \"I'M NOT BARNEY\", \"YOU'RE BARNEY\", \"PEEKABOO\", \"BITCH\", \"NO FRIENDS\", and my personal favorite \"UNION\"\n\nTl;dr   My family had a pet store with a golden macaw that would curse and laugh, occasional and occasionally say borderline racist things to customers, but he was really good with dogs.\n\nedit: some other Barney stories\n\nBarney also loved my father, he would stop in every once in a while and before he did anything else would give Barney his little bird treats. After a while whenever Barney felt like ignored we'd get \"WHERE'S BOB!? CAW MISS BOB! BOB, WHERE'S BOB!?\"\n\nBarney was surprisingly good with puppies though. Barney would jump down into the little pen we had that was full of puppies and let them chase him while he laughed and shrieked obscenities at the little puppies. He'd happily bite a person that was bothering him but would only ever nip at the shiny dog tags on the puppies collars. Cat's on the other hand he hated.\n\nWhen I was about 9 I was trying to put a bag of dog food on some flimsy metal shelf and the shelf broke and I wound up underneath both it and the bag, and before I could get up Barney starts cawing \"CAW YOU FUCKED UP, YOU FUCKED, CAW YOU FUCKED UP\". And when I finally got up and got mad at Barney and yelled at him to shut up all I got back was \"I DON'T WORK HERE, CAW I DON'T WORK HERE!\". This was what Barney did, patiently pretend to be a nice bird all day until you dropped something or something broke, then berate you for fucking up, then tell you \"I don't work here\" when you got mad.\n", "id": "d9qcbk6"}], [{"comment": "Who puts birds into cages deserve way more than that.\n\nBtw. someone who keeps a pet should know about their behaviours.", "id": "d9prss0"}, {"comment": "Some people think it's funny when their pet acts a fool.

We were just planning to raise the dog, but she said she would care for the cat.  At first she was playing with it, caring for it, bought it toys and a litter box, etc.  but then I noticed that she started buying literally the cheapest, crappiest cat food and litter, never changed the litter box on time or properly and then started locking her out of her room??  It was HER cat!! And when she just didn't feel like playing with this lonely little kitty, she would just ignore her.  Poor kitty just wanted and needed some love.  Eventually she started hanging around us more and more and now she is just straight up MY cat.  I didn't really plan on having a cat, but I fell in love with her and I couldn't stand the fact that this sweet little kitty was being ignored.  Now that she's loved and cared for like a \"real\" kitty cat, she is the sweetest more loving and hilarious cat.  And she loves me personally more than anyone, which is adorable.  Sleeps next to me or at my feet every single night, sits with me on the couch, coos and *prrt's* whenever I come in the room and rubs on my feets, she's even chilling with me right now! :3  Also, anytime there is a piece of my clothing on the floor or bed, she always lays on it.  We have such a bond and even though I never planned on having her, I just love her so much.  She stole my heart! \n\n\n\nAnyways...I digress.  The point is,  your roommate was a terrible owner and s/he should have considered finding another person to care for her if she didn't want her.  It wasn't your responsibility to care for someone else's pet, and while I love animals and I love my pup and kitty,  I can't stand animals that ruin homes and personal items.  I never could understand why people let their animals take over there homes, chew up their shit, piss on the rug, scratch up the couch.  It's like...you paid for those things and you just don't care that some cat or dog is destroying them?  So yeah, if my roommate's cat was destroying my things...I would absolutely kick that fucker out of my space.

Don't get me wrong, they require a lot of exercise but it isn't as crazy as people make it out to be. The real secret is to include them. Include them in EVERYTHING. Talk to them while you are cooking, snuggle them on the couch, make everything a little game. Doing laundry?

Have to run to the bank? Take him with you, a lot of banks let you bring well behaved dogs inside. EVERYTHING you do your dog now does too. Set boundaries though and stick to them. Your dog will walk all over them if you let him.\n\nIt isn't just a massive quantity of exercise that keeps them content. It's quality exercise now and then (agility, hikes, swimming) and constant constant constant stimulation in the form of just interacting with your little black and white beast. This is a sensitive breed and that goes two ways: don't be too harsh because they have dramatic lasting reactions to harshness like hiding in a corner or refusing to come when you call them and just looking at you sadly instead.

They are incredibly intelligent, but much more \"subdued\", and can be easily handled by a family and don't go utterly mental if not given a puzzle daily or a 10 mile walk every 5 seconds.

That slowly decreased in frequency and intensity over the next two years and now that she is 5, we take 4 long walks a day averaging 2 hours total but it is far more peaceful than it was before. I was also doing training sessions with her for the first 4 years at about 10 minutes a session at least twice daily, feeding her only from kongs, and all that good stuff. I'm proud to say that she knows over 25 commands and probably obeys them 25% of the time. I love my beast but it's a battle of the wills most days.

He was in constant pain and my parents would tell me about it every night on the phone.  \n\nHe got to a point where he couldn't sleep through the night because of the pain, so we knew it wasn't fair to make him keep fighting.  The night we decided it was time to let him go, I came home.  I skipped all my classes and I spent the day with him and my parents.  We went to a park, and he ran around and was so happy to see me.  He got tired out really quickly though.  \n\nWe laid together in a park, on a Thursday afternoon when I should have been In class.  And I didn't care.  it was great.  He was so happy that day.  There was a creek, and grass and everything was absolutely perfect.  He had his cookies, and treats and toys...\n\nI felt terrible about letting him go.  When it was \"time\", I can't get out of my head how he looked at me, just like he did every other day when he was happy to see me.  \n\nThis was about 2 months ago, and I haven't talked about it much with anyone.  I've been home once since then, and not hearing his foot steps, not seeing his food bowl, not seeing his toys around...  it got to me.

I'd probably not get mine if I went back in time and just get a cat.. they poop so much, everywhere ..hold them too long they poop and pee on you too. Cage needs cleaning daily since the poop just piles up. They need a huge cage, im talking as big as a single bed for 2 or more pigs not like the ones at the pet store you need to make your own. And they eat a shit ton of hay which is expensive unless you buy it from a farm.. and they all have different personalities .. you might get some friendly ones or you could end up with one that does nothing but hides or sits in one spot for hours. We rescued 2 and that's what one did, they never did get really friendly no matter how much we cared for them. Our 3rd one we got as a baby and it's more friendly and it's the only pig that will jump on your lap our other 2 rescues would rather humans left them alone forever unless it's to feed them . Only problem is introducing a 3rd one made the first 2 bitter enemies and there was nothing we could do to make them friends again .. once they hate each other for whatever reason it's really hard to get them back to bonded again. So we needed 2 cages now! Anyway they can be sweet animals and it's adorable when they squeak for food and hit each other with carrots  but just make sure you do research first..they aren't a great pet for little kids either since they are incredibly delicate ..way more than other pets. And can easily get hurt by mistreatment and dropping.  We love ours and wouldn't give them away but I won't be getting anymore once they are gone.  If you rescue one make sure you get to know it's personality before you decide.. because that's what you will be stuck with. If it was socialized and treated well it would probably be a friendly pig.

I've had 8 cats in my life and 3 dogs also and I just find them more enjoyable as pets and cats (imo) require less work than guinea pigs and also give more back in terms of love. That's just my experience with having them and everyone will have their own experience. but in any case just do the research what they actually require in terms of care because they are not a \"get and forget\" animal they need daily work and mundane tasks of cleaning and also \"floor time\" outside their cage daily. As long as people are up for it they should know all the facts first of what these animals need to thrive. I've seen way too many people trying to get rid of guinea pigs on Craigslist or surrendering them to pet stores because they don't get the care and attention they need and get neglected.

And that's because we mainly consume milk chocolate and chocolate substitute products which contain far less of the poisonous ingredient, methylxanthine. White chocolate contains almost none. Baking and Dark chocolate contains the highest and should really be avoided all together. But, ultimately, giving your dog a piece of (low methylxanthine) chocolate will not kill them. \n\nHowever, NEVER GIVE DOGS XYLITOL! It's a sugar substitute, commonly found in gum, baked goods and candies. Even in small doses it can cause vomiting, seizures, and liver failure.
