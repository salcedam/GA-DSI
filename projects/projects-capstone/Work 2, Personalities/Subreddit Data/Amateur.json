Women are never attracted to men's bodies for their physical appearance, they rather always care about the _implications_ of a man's appearance.\n\nWomen want a man who is tall, intelligent, and with professions that symbolize either status or wealth. You could look like a walrus and they wouldn't care.\n\nAlthough I'm not in the field of biology, I think another reason why it seems unlikely that women are attracted to men is the fact that fetuses start out as female and then proceed to become males. I honestly find it difficult to believe that so much change can occur in our brains that can \"flip\" and result in the same type of attraction to the opposite sex just as you proceed to male from female; what probably happens is subtle changes in what already exists in this area (slightly numb attraction to female features, and strengthen desire for \"masculine\" traits).\n\nOne thing that seems to partially contradict my hypothesis, however, is the fact that gay men seem to actually be attracted to other men's bodies, but I don't know much about that. Although I'm straight, I view the female form to be absolutely disgusting on those days where my libido is low, and I find myself appreciate the male form usually depicted in art such as that of Da Vinci's and others, and I instead draw the bodies of muscular and bearded \"Greek god\"-like characters (not sexual at all) rather than naked women and sluts (which I view as the most beautiful thing in existence on days with high libido). \n\nIt surely is complicated, and we often here how \"misunderstood\" and mysterious (ugh...) female sexuality is, but it probably is the case (though I don't completely believe this) that female sexuality simply does not exist in the sense that we males experience it; what we should try to study however and no longer refer to it as \"female sexuality\" is the consent of a female to intercourse. Because it simply could be that it seems complicated because there is no \"sexuality\" at all, but rather an _evaluation_ of a mate and whether or not he is fit to have intercourse, and somehow the female should enjoy what she gets in sex (however it maybe and may differ between mates of the same female) as long as she consents to give out her self once she deems the mate fit to be a member of a certain set of males with certain traits.", "id": "cy1220y"}, {"comment": "I don't know how to go about this, but have you *ever* been laid?
