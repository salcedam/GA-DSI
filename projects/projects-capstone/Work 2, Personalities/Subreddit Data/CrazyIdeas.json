For the sake of this hypothetical lets assume you actually wanted to run to become president, what is your strategy?\n\nIf I < D+R\n\nVote against whoever has the most votes at any given time.

That ridiculous and,  I think,  disingenuous. It's not at all how language works.  I've never heard of a word being pronounced so as to ensure its pronunciation is exactly consistent across multiple languages. It's simply not a realistic concern or one that's ever been factored into pronunciations. \n\nAll of this somewhat goes against what I said about German, but realistically, enough German speakers speak English that they should be familiar with the soft G in borrowed words... or they can opt for the hard G. That doesn't change the rationale behind the primary pronunciation.  Again, that isn't something factored in to how we pronounce a word coined in English.\n\nAlso, the English J and Zh may not seem similar to you, but they are extremely similar in how they are made with your mouth. Position your mouth as if you're about to pronounce a J sound, but hum instead of pronouncing it as a plosive (made by blocking air and letting it escape rapidly, like a P sound).

This is not a criticism of Bolt. EVERYONE at this level of competition is doping. It doesn't make his achievements any less impressive. It really doesn't. Steroids don't magically make you into a freakish speed demon. They let you recover more quickly and effectively. That means he can train MORE than someone who isn't on drugs.

Do you really think these gains are coming from people working harder, luck, or anything like that.\n\nRunning isn't about free-muscle mass, it's about short power output, and output ratios. Longer legs help with longer strides, lower weight helps with acceleration, and strength helps with both acceleration and speed. The whole thing is pretty simple. Usain Bolt is shattering records by people we KNOW doped, in a sport where technology hasn't changed terribly much in the past 30 years. (shoes are a bit better, surfaces as well, but not enough to make up for the record) And half a second may seem like a 5% or whatever improvement, but the extra strength needed for a 5% faster sprint time isn't 5%. You get HARD diminishing returns at the top of a field like that.\n\nMy numbers may be wrong for proving he's doping for muscle mass, but that isn't the only type of enhancements that one can be doing.

Hell, I would have done it for free, but I guess this guy had something against the prick. I don't blame him. It takes a special kind of dirtbag to become a killer for hire.\n\nThen there was the next job, another killer. This one proved more difficult than the last. I almost got the feeling he was coming after me, but I can't be got. I'm the best there is. I shook off the crazy notions and went to pick up my payload, but the guy had another gig for me. Yeah, you guessed it: another hit man, like me.\n\nThis time I had a plan. I'd wait to see if this hit man came for me, and he did - guns a-blazing. Kids these days have no style anymore. Maybe the next one would be more inclined to talk things out.\n\nIt became routine. The boss man always made it seem like this one was the last job. He'd pay me and I'd be halfway out the door then all of a sudden he'd remember there was another prick he wanted dead.\n\nHow many could I get through before he wanted me dead too? I may be the best, but a man's gotta sleep some time.\n\nThis latest job was for Nicky Shadows, a legend. Yeah, the boss man didn't use that name but anyone who's anyone in this gig knows the Shadow. Finally, a class act like me. I got thinking we could get together and get the man with all the cash. No more jobs, just the payload. I wouldn't mind splitting it with Nicky. Unfortunately, she wasn't much of a conversationalist.\n\nI did what anyone would do if they knew Nicky Shadows was after 'em, sleep with one eye open and with a gun under the pillow. I spent many restless nights in wait, but I should have guessed Nicky would have figured out the boss man's game. She'd wait in the shadows forever if he had to; she was a professional.\n\nIt went on for days - waiting, and more waiting. The boss man kept calling, pestering me about his job. I stopped answering. As far as I was concerned, he was a dead man anyway - just as long as I could avoid the same fate.\n\nI couldn't wait any more. The fear was driving me crazy. I'd have to kill the boss man myself. I'm sure the Shadow would understand. Like I said, she's a professional. If there's no money to be had in killing me, it wouldn't be done.\n\nI called for a meet with the boss man. Boy was he pissed to hear from me after so long. I wonder what was going through the wacko's head in the first place. It didn't matter, cause when I was done with him it would be a bullet.\n\nI came in gun drawn. He begged for his life. They all did. It's why I love this job. But something was different about this guy; his expression changed.\n\nBefore I could figure out what why, I felt it. Piano wire around my throat. Soft silky hair touching my shoulders as a gasped for air. Nicky Shadows. Sure I coulda killed the boss man in that moment but it felt right to go down like this. I struggled, cause that's what you do, but I accepted it. Darkness crept up on me.

Hell, I would have done it for free, but I guess this guy had something against the prick. I don't blame him. It takes a special kind of dirtbag to become a killer for hire.\n\nThen there was the next job, another killer. This one proved more difficult than the last. I almost got the feeling he was coming after me, but I can't be got. I'm the best there is. I shook off the crazy notions and went to pick up my payload, but the guy had another gig for me. Yeah, you guessed it: another hit man, like me.\n\nThis time I had a plan. I'd wait to see if this hit man came for me, and he did - guns a-blazing. Kids these days have no style anymore. Maybe the next one would be more inclined to talk things out.\n\nIt became routine. The boss man always made it seem like this one was the last job. He'd pay me and I'd be halfway out the door then all of a sudden he'd remember there was another prick he wanted dead.\n\nHow many could I get through before he wanted me dead too? I may be the best, but a man's gotta sleep some time.\n\nThis latest job was for Nicky Shadows, a legend. Yeah, the boss man didn't use that name but anyone who's anyone in this gig knows the Shadow. Finally, a class act like me. I got thinking we could get together and get the man with all the cash. No more jobs, just the payload. I wouldn't mind splitting it with Nicky. Unfortunately, she wasn't much of a conversationalist.\n\nI did what anyone would do if they knew Nicky Shadows was after 'em, sleep with one eye open and with a gun under the pillow. I spent many restless nights in wait, but I should have guessed Nicky would have figured out the boss man's game. She'd wait in the shadows forever if he had to; she was a professional.\n\nIt went on for days - waiting, and more waiting. The boss man kept calling, pestering me about his job. I stopped answering. As far as I was concerned, he was a dead man anyway - just as long as I could avoid the same fate.\n\nI couldn't wait any more. The fear was driving me crazy. I'd have to kill the boss man myself. I'm sure the Shadow would understand. Like I said, she's a professional. If there's no money to be had in killing me, it wouldn't be done.\n\nI called for a meet with the boss man. Boy was he pissed to hear from me after so long. I wonder what was going through the wacko's head in the first place. It didn't matter, cause when I was done with him it would be a bullet.\n\nI came in gun drawn. He begged for his life. They all did. It's why I love this job. But something was different about this guy; his expression changed.\n\nBefore I could figure out what why, I felt it. Piano wire around my throat. Soft silky hair touching my shoulders as a gasped for air. Nicky Shadows. Sure I coulda killed the boss man in that moment but it felt right to go down like this. I struggled, cause that's what you do, but I accepted it. Darkness crept up on me.

As a sort of play on this, technology is present, but not understood or remarked upon by most.  Automation has driven most out of labor jobs, and very few still plow their trades.   Those would be artisans and craftsmen of a higher cord, brought up specifically around their trade.  Success is no longer measured in how bright you can be, or how smarts can really change your lot in life.  It's measured instead in produced energy, in loyalty, and in the only thing computers really don't need to do: Violence.   Thus, the people are rowdy, raucous, uneducated, and servile.  Automation in food lead to great population booms, and as a result, Earth as we know it disappeared, replaced by an overcroweded ball of people and steel.\n\nDemocracy cannot last forever as a state grows.  Representation by the people leads to a tyranny of the people.   When populations reach a certain critical mass, the sub-cultures within a population start to grow too big to communicate with each other, creating echo-chambers of faulty logic and reasoning.  Simply put, you are too far away from the next idea to hear it.  So, when the next billion people over ask for the color orange, and your population likes to color blue, fights will come out over it.  Populations fracture, civil war erupts.  The world falls into war and strife.\n\nThat is, if the populations had control.   Thankfully, that was done away with in the late 2000's.   Now, with the 34th century fast approaching, Kings and Queens rule the lands, skies, and planets once more.  Without a voice, the people, numerous as they are, can be at peace with the knowledge that there is someone out there conducting matters of state as true leaders should, and with the intention to promote not only the greater good, but the advancement of our species as a whole.\n\nOf course, bringing back the nobility brought it's own problems.  The politics.  The hierarchy.  The nepotism.   The intrigue. \n\nWelcome back to Camelot."], [0, "That idea is not totally new, look at shrek.\n\nHowever, it would be an amazing idea at a series, as you said.\n\nTry writting some short stories to taste the idea.

As a sort of play on this, technology is present, but not understood or remarked upon by most.  Automation has driven most out of labor jobs, and very few still plow their trades.   Those would be artisans and craftsmen of a higher cord, brought up specifically around their trade.  Success is no longer measured in how bright you can be, or how smarts can really change your lot in life.  It's measured instead in produced energy, in loyalty, and in the only thing computers really don't need to do: Violence.   Thus, the people are rowdy, raucous, uneducated, and servile.  Automation in food lead to great population booms, and as a result, Earth as we know it disappeared, replaced by an overcroweded ball of people and steel.\n\nDemocracy cannot last forever as a state grows.  Representation by the people leads to a tyranny of the people.   When populations reach a certain critical mass, the sub-cultures within a population start to grow too big to communicate with each other, creating echo-chambers of faulty logic and reasoning.  Simply put, you are too far away from the next idea to hear it.  So, when the next billion people over ask for the color orange, and your population likes to color blue, fights will come out over it.  Populations fracture, civil war erupts.  The world falls into war and strife.\n\nThat is, if the populations had control.   Thankfully, that was done away with in the late 2000's.   Now, with the 34th century fast approaching, Kings and Queens rule the lands, skies, and planets once more.  Without a voice, the people, numerous as they are, can be at peace with the knowledge that there is someone out there conducting matters of state as true leaders should, and with the intention to promote not only the greater good, but the advancement of our species as a whole.\n\nOf course, bringing back the nobility brought it's own problems.

His main hatred of them derived from the fact that he thought they \"Stabbed Germany in the back\" when she was just about to win the war by conspiring with the British to artificially bring the Americans into the war and sabotage internal industry.

We'll secure victory by the year's out\"\n\nActually this might actually be an interesting way to take it. Hitler is usually portrayed as the apotheosis of evil (and rightly so) and is someone you pull out when you want to shoot off the big fireworks or create a set-piece moment. And sure: Hitler in 1936 or 39 or 41 (even in 33) could definitely fit that mould.\n\nBut back in 1918 or 1920, he really wasn't that outstanding or different from many other citizens of Weimar: hatred of Jews thanks to men like Ludendorff was extremely widespread; shock at Germany's loss or a totally false belief in its imminent victory even in the final days of the war was omnipresent thanks to universally-distributed propaganda; and Hitler himself lived as a floater, drifting through Germany and being passively engaged in politics through street flyers and conservative pamphlets. Simply put: he was exceptionally unexceptional.\n\nMany, many historians will tell you that the Weimar Republic could not succeed as a nation-state because A) the Germans did not *want* it to succeed, and more importantly, B) it wasn't *set up* by the WW1 Allies to succeed. Between the crushing reparations that threw the economy into a tailspin (e.g. hyperinflation); the asinine electoral system that consistently changed party hands and made long-term progress impossible; and the completely unstable political climate that saw communists, social democrats, conservatives and proto-fascists all existing in the same space (and which Wiemar was *imposed upon*), you had a western-style nation-state in Germany that could not and never *would* succeed so long as the Germany of the time was its territory. I won't say that WW2 was inevitable as a result of Weimar's construction: without Hitler *specifically* (and his unusual levels of aggression, cruelty and recklessness), WW2 would probably have never happened. But Weimar's climate almost certainly made the rise of someone *like* Hitler much more likely.\n\nThat relatively (for vidoe games) complex message--that horrible men are products of horrible environments that non-horrible people may not necessarily create with bad intentions (i.e. we can create evil and vengeance, even when we don't try to)--can be conveyed by doing exactly what you said: putting a character who looks suspiciously like Hitler in a completely everyday, ordinary situation. In a veterans hospital or as a beggar on the street. That makes the message fairly clear and very poignant, and it's one that can only be told through the medium of video games.", "id": "d8hpj1v"}, {"comment": "Why Weimar did the rise of \"someone like Hitler \" was much more likely ? \n\nWouldn't a common dictator(one that isn't careless, and probably less aggressive ) fullfil a similar political role ? \n\nFor example, ending the reparations could have been done without war , just some weapon building and threats , right?", "id": "d8hrv8l"}, {"comment": "See that's a problem in my eyes.

Of course, there's no real chance of ever actually collecting, but so long as people are willing to trade the IOUs, the system still works.\n\nCongratulations, we have just invented a new currency."], [37, "How about everyone puts 10K into a pot and then at the end of the year the pot is equally divided between all the participants who are still alive. \n\nThe world's mortality rate is sitting at about 0.8% per year, so if one thousand people entered ~8 of them should die, and their money could then be split.\n\nedit: And of course make the whole thing anonymous so the participants aren't tempted to kill each other."], [32, "Now this is a lottery I can get behind  "], [23, "There's an episode of sliders kinda  like this."], [22, "This is actually an interesting example on consumers positive vs negative risk assessment we learned about in one of my economics class.\n\nIs been years so I forget the exact terminology, but the premise is as follows:\n\nTheoretically, if I offered you a scenario where you're taking a gamble on a few options but the overall average return you can expect is 10% (you invest $10, you'll on average get back $11), one might think it shouldn't matter what the options are... an expected 10% return is an expected 10% return.\n\nHowever it turns out it really does matter.  Consumers have a high tolerance for risk when they are putting little up front even if there's a low probability of a large sum return, but have a low tolerance for risk when they are putting a lot up front even if there's a low probability of losing a large sum,  **even if the expected average return is the same, or even higher for the large up front option**.\n\nThis example is a perfect demonstration of this.  Would you honestly put up $10,000 for an almost guaranteed chance of winning $5 (say 1999/2000 times) for that 1/2000 chance that you'll lose your $10,000?  Or would you be more likely to put up $5 (or $10 as we will take on even more risk in this scenario) for a chance at winning $10,000, even if your odds are 1/2000?\n\nTo put it simply, my ultimate understanding was people can't stomach risking a big loss, but will accept lower odds if it means the chance at winning big."], [15, "You can do something like this yourself by playing roulette at the casino. First you bet $1 on red (or black). If you win, you win a dollar! If you lose, bet $2. If you win that then you win $2 minus the $1 you already lost, so $1. If you lose, double up your bet again. Keep going until you eventually win or you've lost more than $10,000. There is a very high probability you'll win at some point and you'll finish up $1.

The definition of authoritarian is: \"favoring or enforcing strict obedience to authority, especially that of the government, at the expense of personal freedom.\" I would certainly argue that Trump has demonstrated this tendency: his decrying of net neutrality, his desire for Apple to hand over the keys to unlock iPhones to the FBI, his desire to execute Snowden for \"treason,\" his statements about opening up libel laws, his mandate for the death penalty for anyone who kills a police officer, his propensity for torture, his statement that soldiers will commit war crimes because Trump is a strong leader, and his treatment of protestors. I would definitely describe him as a nationalist, which is defined as \"a person who advocates political independence for a country.\" His slogan \"America first\" and his denouncement of globalism for \"Americanism\" certainly fits the definition of a nationalist. His distaste for immigrants (even more educated immigrant groups like those receiving H-1B visas) also fits within the designation of a nationalist. So, according to the definition of fascism (\"an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization\"), Trump certainly seems to at least somewhat fit within this designation. I never said that every right winger (or even anywhere close to the majority) promote or adhere to fascism. Trump's vein of conservatism is demonstrably closer to fascism than any of his contemporaries.\n\nAnother element of many fascist regimes is a quasi-level of worship among the leader's supporters. The term \"God emperor\" certainly indicates that level of reverence, and it is unseen among any other recent American candidate's followers. \"Hilldog\" doesn't imply that your candidate is flawless. The refusal of many Trump supporters to admit any faults in their leader is also indicative of the level to which Trump supporters venerate him. \n\nI have not spent much time on TheDonald, but the few times I've visited, I have seen ample evidence of bigotry. One example that particularly stuck out to me, was the image that associated the European Union with Judaism - with a golden star underneath a sticker of the EU, echo brackets surrounding the name \"European Union,\" and the words six-million written next to it. That imagery certainly harkened back to propaganda seen during the Nazi regime, when Nazis attempted to propagate the idea that Jews secretly control the world. Many images are tagged \"deport Islam.\" Here are several examples of outright racism captured on TheDonald:\nhttps://i.reddituploads.com/b1d74b3c72c9414b973f3ff86700c2f1?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=1c7e133af9d0f054ae9b77186ad77c83\nhttps://i.redd.it/0cwv2ywug09x.png\nhttps://i.reddituploads.com/27214f3d575948ba8702bf73a05304f0?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=17c7a911db786455a04b39260adc3f0e\nhttps://i.redd.it/3a37f21fdddx.png\nhttps://i.redd.it/deu6oibepdcx.png\nhttps://i.redd.it/i56cyijmuycx.png\nhttps://i.redd.it/ldlw5uk7ee8x.png\n\nThe step-sister of Anne Frank, who herself survived the Holocaust, says that Trump reminds her of Hitler: http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/27/politics/anne-frank-donald-trump-adolf-hitler/\n\nThe ACLU compiled a list of all of Trump's policies that are unconstitutional (it's 27 pages long): https://action.aclu.org/sites/default/files/pages/trumpmemos.pdf", "id": "d6bisr5"}, {"comment": "> There is zero proof or evidence of any of your claims.\n\nUnless you actually listen to what Donald Trump himself says.", "id": "d6bq2l7"}, {"comment": "Find the racist quote", "id": "d6bvzpp"}, {"comment": "QUOTE: \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.

We also have to be careful of the normalization of Trump, because he is, in fact, still unfit for the presidency.

I know four women with that name and they spell it four ways. My google won't load again so I can't check it.) supporters, or Bernie supporters are decent people I would get along with just fine. Mostly because most people I meet seem pretty decent and agreeable, and while I don't poll everyone I meet about their political views, it stands to reason that roughly 50% of them are trump supporters.\n\nBut I know two trump supporters are giant assholes, one as I said threw beer on my cousin and her kids, and one broke my uncle's arm. So those two are assholes.\n\nIn the sake of fairness, my landlord also voted for Trump (which I only know due to him having a campaign sign, he's never flat out mentioned anything about it) and he is one of the kindest people I have ever met. He went digging in his storage to loan me a pet carrier when mine was stolen the week before I needed to take my cats to be fixed. He also catches our dog when he slips his harness and brings him home for us. (Dog always goes to Landlord's house to play with his dogs, so if he knows we aren't home, he'll let them play awhile then drive him back to our house and let him onto our sunporch. He also gave us his dog's harnesses and collars when his dog passed away because he had an escape artist too and figured maybe one of the contraptions would help us out) \n\nI think a old lady I drive to get groceries voted Trump too, I drove her to vote but I didn't look at her ballot.

What about adults who don't have enough money left over after paying what's obligated to be paid? And then there are adults who don't have enough free time to travel. There are a lot of problems with this. Pokemon Go works because anyone can play it and there are likely Pokemon around your town. It's not like you have to go to Asia to catch a Jigglypuff. Anyone with 10 minutes to spare can open it up and walk around a bit to try to find a Pokemon, or even use Incense to attract Pokemon. Plus you don't need any money AT ALL to play Pokemon Go. You can get free Pokeballs, eggs, potions, and revives from PokeStops. To get a Dragonball you'll have to Asia to get the next one, or one of them. And on top of that, do we get hints on where the next one will spawn, or is it pretty random? If it's random then you'd spend a lot of money traveling around. A lot of money AND time. \n\nWhat about risky territory? Russia, places controlled by ISIS, the Congo, etc. \n\nPeople becoming nomadic can be tricky to do, and requires a lot of time and planning. Heck, it'd still be expensive as you'll need to still buy food, probably bathe (depending on how you want to do it it's either free but questionable or paid and, well, you paid), gas money (horses are impractical, feet are even more impractical, bikes aren't always practical, there's not much else besides that and nothing is really practical or as practical as car), and other traveling expenses. \n\nPokemon Go doesn't have ads, does it? I haven't gotten any. If it does then it's odd that I don't get any - I am rooted but I don't have any adblockers on my phone. What ad revenue would this DB game get? Why would it have ads? Would many people still play it if it had ads? Not only does it have GPS and data being constantly used for data expenses, but also it drains the battery quite fast. With ads you're using more battery and data. \n\nTo be fair this is under /r/CrazyIdeas so it's more lighthearted, but the sad truth is this is simply impractical to do. It would require a lot of time and probably money. Only the lucky few could do this game, so a lot of people would feel left out. That mean even less potential ad revenue (if any exists at all) because your market base is super small.

And then there are adults who don't have enough free time to travel. There are a lot of problems with this. Pokemon Go works because anyone can play it and there are likely Pokemon around your town. It's not like you have to go to Asia to catch a Jigglypuff. Anyone with 10 minutes to spare can open it up and walk around a bit to try to find a Pokemon, or even use Incense to attract Pokemon. Plus you don't need any money AT ALL to play Pokemon Go. You can get free Pokeballs, eggs, potions, and revives from PokeStops. To get a Dragonball you'll have to Asia to get the next one, or one of them. And on top of that, do we get hints on where the next one will spawn, or is it pretty random? If it's random then you'd spend a lot of money traveling around. A lot of money AND time. \n\nWhat about risky territory? Russia, places controlled by ISIS, the Congo, etc. \n\nPeople becoming nomadic can be tricky to do, and requires a lot of time and planning. Heck, it'd still be expensive as you'll need to still buy food, probably bathe (depending on how you want to do it it's either free but questionable or paid and, well, you paid), gas money (horses are impractical, feet are even more impractical, bikes aren't always practical, there's not much else besides that and nothing is really practical or as practical as car), and other traveling expenses. \n\nPokemon Go doesn't have ads, does it? I haven't gotten any. If it does then it's odd that I don't get any - I am rooted but I don't have any adblockers on my phone. What ad revenue would this DB game get? Why would it have ads? Would many people still play it if it had ads? Not only does it have GPS and data being constantly used for data expenses, but also it drains the battery quite fast. With ads you're using more battery and data. \n\nTo be fair this is under /r/CrazyIdeas so it's more lighthearted, but the sad truth is this is simply impractical to do. It would require a lot of time and probably money. Only the lucky few could do this game, so a lot of people would feel left out.

Aren't we really interested in upvotes? if you have 226 million posts (submissions? the link says 73 million posts a year, and 82.5 billion page views, so I wonder if that's a mistake?), then you only get 45 random front pagers if you also have 226million * x upvotes and they are evenly distributed, or the upvote you automatically give yourself is in the lottery.\n\nAccording to the link there were 6.89 billion upvotes last year, that's just shy of 19 million per day. We'll round up and say 20mil. that's 4 per day worth a bonus 5000 points. Now the question is: \"how are up votes distributed?\". Obviously pages that are already on the front page have a better chance than pages stuck in obscure, private subreddits. It's the same as comparing buying thousands of lottery tickets to only buying a couple. What we still need to know though is the variance. Are there a few posts with many, many upvotes and many with few? Or do the front page posts make it to the top by the skin of their teeth? Unfortunately, I can't find any numbers, but I assume that it's large. If front page posts already receive 4 times the number of votes that the median post receives than those lucky upvotes are probably just boosting posts that are already on the front page most of the time. At most, you get 4 a day, if upvotes are evenly distributed. The more uneven the distribution, the less likely a post that's not already on the front page will get there via the lottery system. All this assumes the 20 million upvotes per day are strictly upvotes on posts and doesn't include upvotes on comments.\n\ntl:dr At most there would be 4 random posts a day making it to the front page, but that is unrealistically optimistic.\n\n EDIT: Am I missing out on a joke or something?", "id": "d0h28mx"}, {"comment": "82 billion posts a year seems wrong.

A fetus conceived by rape is less important than a fetus conceived by consensual sex? Clearly they aren't trying to say that, right? By making an exception for fetuses conceived by rape you are just saying that being forced to remain pregnant is a punishment for having consensual sex and that you don't really care about the life.\n\nYou need to be consistent. Either you care about the life of the fetus and thus it should be illegal whether it was from rape or not. Or you don't care (or don't care as much compared to the life of the woman), and it should be legal regardless because pregnancy shouldn't be used as a punishment. The valid only exception should be in the case of the life of the woman, especially considering most of those cases would result in the fetus dying anyway.\n\nI'm pro choice but I'd much rather see a pro lifer who doesn't make arbitrary exceptions because at least they are being consistent. Pro lifers who make an exception for rape seem like hypocrites and much more anti-woman to me. Also the pro lifers who want it to be legal only for rape victims need to realize that doing that would make it much more difficult for rape victims to get abortions anyway and would increase the rate of false rape accusations. The only option that makes sense if you want it to be legal for rape victims is for it to be legal for everyone.", "id": "d5t6t50"}, {"comment": "Yeah, the rape exception definitely seems to destroy the whole concept behind the pro-life position, which is trying to prevent murder of an unborn baby - unless, of course, one becomes anti-abortion for a different reason than to categorically prevent murder of unborn babies.\n\nYou could argue from some kind of duty-based point of view. I am no philosopher but if I had to make a very crude outline, it could go somewhat like this:\n\nSex is an act which has a nonzero probability of resulting in pregnancy. If you consent to the act, you implicitly consent to deal with the consequences if they eventually arise. Given the fact that the ethical status of fetuses, the idea of potential persons etc. is unresolved and questionable, the one who has indeed consented to the consequences also has a duty to err on the safer side of dealing with them, that means that the person has a duty to not get an abortion (if the act itself was consensual), because only then its safe to say no one's rights are breached: unaborted baby is unaborted so there is no issue there, and the woman consented to the sex, which was an informed moral choice she made about her body (she knew about the possible consequences and her duty do err on the safer side if they arose beforehand), and thus her will has had her rightful say about the future of her body and the matter is resolved. When, however, the mother is raped, she has no duty to deal with the consequences in any particular way, because she didn't consent to the act that lead to those consequences in the first place. There was no contract and thus no duties.\n\nBasically if you believe in some kind of deontological, duty and contract based ethics based on the singular pillar of consent, I believe there could be some room for an anti-abortion, non-pro-life argument that would allow rape exceptions.\n\nOf course, there is another possibility not a lot of people realise: maybe there is no just solution. Maybe there really, absolutely, objectively is not a single position that would not be unjust to someone in the whole mother vs. baby vs. society conflict. No winning move possible, all lead to loss. If that is the case, well, we're fucked. And to be honest, I think its quite possible.", "id": "d5tbq7g"}, {"comment": "The problem with that argument is it doesn't hold up anywhere else in life. You consent to getting in a car despite the nonzero probability of getting in a car accident. By that logic, you should be left to die if you get in a car accident because you consented to the car accident by getting in a car and shouldn't get medical treatment for it. Consent to having sex is not consent to getting pregnant. Pregnancy does not come with zero risk to the woman. Any pregnancy is a higher risk chance of death or serious injury for the woman compared to having an abortion. If she doesn't want to be pregnant, no one should force her to be pregnant and risk her life and health just because of a choice she may or may not have made. Pregnancy is a serious commitment and it should be the woman's decision on whether carrying the fetus to term is worthwhile compared to the health risk.", "id": "d5tcsm2"}, {"comment": "The whole idea that pro-lifers are immoral or stupid is one of those opinions where the Reddit hivemind truly missed the mark.\n\nIt's a debate over when life begins that has been made about hating women and killing innocent children.

A dictatorship of the proletariat (DotP) is essentially a society where the power is held by the 99%, so it's not a dictatorship in the sense that we know it. Marx would say that our current system is a dictatorship of the bourgeousie: the one percent. In a DotP, workers would share ownership in their workplace and would earn based on what they made in the form of labor vouchers. Some excess capital may be used to grow the business, obviously, and to pay taxes, but the rest will go back to the workers themselves. More productive workers would earn more. The system would be equal, but people and needs aren't, so earnings wouldn't be equal. However, individual ownership of income producing property would be prohibited, so while there would be income inequality, the potential for that inequality to start exponentially growing is removed.\n\nMarx believed that human behavior is based on our culture. So, what we call human nature is just cultural capitalism. The idea of the DotP is to create a society that still has traces of our old culture in it, but one that discourages greed and encourages cooperation and wealth distribution. \n\nThe eventual end goal is communism: a classless society where everyone gives of their ability and receives of their needs, but if it's even feasible, it's not a ten, twenty year thing. It's a very slow gradual transition into it, and we'd be ready when we're ready. We're talking generations, centuries even.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nNow is where opinion comes into play, I guess. Not everyone treats Marx like communist Jesus, and many of us just see him as a philosopher and social scientist, that got many things right, but not necessarily everything, so there are lots of interpretations of the socialist state and how to achieve it. Many people don't even worry about the communist end goal part because it seems too far out, in more ways than one. Some believe that a strong social democracy (think nordic countries) can segue into true socialism, whereas others believe that things have to be, ahem, shook up, and others believe that agitation is meaningless because the pitchforks will be brandished en masse when the time is right.    \n\nSome think Lenin had some good ideas that failed because of one reason or another, whereas others want nothing to do with his ideas or legacy.\n\nMe, I think that certain things will have to come to pass before actual socialism is viable, and I'm doubtful that I'll see it happen in my lifetime. Class consciousness is important, which is basically people being pissed off over getting paid $10/hr for making someone $20/hr and realizing that the current system only allows the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer. IMHO, global class consciousness is important: some very awful things (ecological disasters, and extreme wealth inequality to mention two) are going to have to happen first to make the public come to the conclusion that capitalism isn't infinitely sustainable, and either peacefully or not, will have to introduce a society that, while not perfect, aims to reverse the effects of the problems that are only starting to manifest now. \n\n---------------------------------\n\nSo, your question doesn't really have a satisfying answer, because the end society would have an entirely different set of customs and mores than the current one. What would happen would probably be that those people who don't cooperate would be shunned yet still provided for. They'd still be fed and clothed and housed, but they'd be looked down upon until they started pulling their weight. \n\nStill though, the end goal of a true communist society is admittedly a moonshot, so personally, people calling it such elicits a \"well, duh\" from me.\n\n", "id": "d92uryj"}, {"comment": "What happens when \"getting looked down upon\" has no shame attached to it and most of society realizes this is the most favorable option?\n\nWill higher level jobs just have to pay out so many labor vouchers to make it worth it?", "id": "d92yo3e"}, {"comment": "Again, we're talking about the admittedly idealistic end result. \n\nSo, in that society, it *would* have shame attached to it.          \nLabor would be looked at differently.         \nIt would have to be, otherwise we wouldn't be in that society.\n\nThere is a tendency to think that the here and now is representative of everywhere and all time, when that's just not the case.        \n\nWorking and going to school with foreign nationals and immigrants, there are some things that are common for us that are almost taboo for them, and vice versa. For many eastern cultures, it's a bad thing to stand out too much or be too selfish, and they get hurt by it when they come here because they'll, say, fix everyone else's problems then claim it was a team effort when they did 75%. They'll be the last people getting raises or bonuses because everyone else at performance reviews will talk themselves up since we're accustomed to how the game is played here, whereas they'll point out their flaws because humility is valued in their culture. \n\nThere's good and bad aspects of that, yes, and I'm very aware of the bad aspects (cheating and aversion to swimming against the tide of public opinion being two biggies), but it's a very different culture that usually punishes, rather than rewards, self interest. Not saying our new culture should mimic an already existing one, only saying that a lot of things ascribed to human nature do vary based on culture.\n\nIf most of this society believes that there's no shame in taking without giving back, then we haven't reached the point of communism in that society, simple as that.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, if you're talking about in a transitional stage, well, the more you produce, the more you earn. Maybe, they're vouchers, maybe they're money, but being that vouchers would still be treated as currency, despite some differences, I'm just going to use the terms currency and money from here on.\n\nHere's where interpretation starts coming into play. Marx mostly wrote about the failings of Capitalism, and his most detailed plan for the new economy is still pretty much just a rough outline. After all, he believed in the eventual inevitability of socialism. Again, not everyone who values his insight takes his word as gospel. \n\nNow, Marx did write somewhat about this. Labor vouchers would be based on average labor time, so for the same amount worked, really slow workers will get less and really fast workers would get more.         \nSkilled labor would earn a multiple of unskilled.         \nService jobs are also a little tricky, especially given that they're much more numerous than in Marx's time, but they still produce a product in a sense.\n\nThings are different than they were in the mid 19th century. We have a consumer culture that sprung up out of the necessity to keep making and selling things that Marx didn't appear to anticipate. \n\nNowadays, we're even past that, and into a debt based system.\n\nSome believe in nationalization of private industries, with control eventually being relinquished to the public, and some people believe in a gradual change through laws. Both have their potential problems, yes.\n\nFor me, I lean towards democratic transition to market socialism in some ways: kinda like the Nordic countries on Steroids.   \n\nSo, there would be social welfare programs to make sure people don't starve or freeze to death, and max income would be capped where everything above it would be taxed at 100% or close to it, which would give more incentive to invest in the company and hopefully the community, there would be a focus on rehabilitation over penitence when it comes to the prison system, the stock market probably wouldn't be a thing anymore or at least not in a recognizable form, and privately owned companies would be penalized based on income, with cooperatives being heavily incentivized. \n\nHowever, that can and likely would, still allow for the executive and skilled roles to earn more than the lower skilled and unskilled positions. If I'm designing the widgets, I'll be earning more than the people machining the widgets, who will be earning more than the people packaging them for transport. Above me would be the person making the bulk of the managerial decisions whatever their title may be, however, being that WidgCo is cooperatively owned, we'd all get to vote on salary cuts and increases, so our CEO likely won't get away with earning 300x that as the average worker/owner, and if the demand for widgets is lower than expected and the company falls on tough times, all the workers would have to collectively decide on whether to make less or cut jobs.\n\n", "id": "d93e14l"}, {"comment": "Gulag", "id": "d92pas5"}, {"comment": "Reeducation camps or the wall depending on their bend.

'Oh look at me, Mr. Revolution' coming around with his war medals and his good looks and his what-the-fuck accent, charming the masses with these eloquent speeches meant to rile people up, riding the divide just to get your own way!\" Kennedy sat up, feigning amusement. \"You use people!

I mean, aren't you?\" Kennedy leaned out of bed. \"Pass me my slippers?\" He let out a yawn. Nixon grabbed his teddy bear slippers from under the bedside table and tossed them at Kennedy's head. \n\n\"Look. Let me show you something.\" Kennedy hopped down from the top bunk and trapsed over to the bookshelves. \"Lincoln wrote something years ago that fits just this dilemma. Let me see...\"\n\n\"Stop quoting Lincoln to me.\"\n\n\"I have it by memory anyway. Here it is,\" Kennedy cleared his throat, standing in a contemplative pose. \"He, the man who presides over a Kingdom, carries the hopes and dreams of all. But, alas, he must dash them, but for few, because the clash of those hopes and dreams are irreconcilable. The people speak, we listen, we speak, we do nothing. The wheel turns its slow stride moving into the great unknown. We must instruct with authority, guide in darkness, despite ourselves being afraid of the dark, and without compass. This much I know: in truth is deceit. It is man's burden to bear.\"\n\nThe bedroom fell silent in the dark. Nixon stared on. Kennedy paused in contemplation. \n\n\"Yes, or something like that.

Markdown relies on people using special characters, often in pairs, like \\*\\*bold\\*\\* or \\*italics\\* or \\~\\~strikeout\\~\\~:  \n\n**bold** *italics* ~~strikeout~~\n\nOne of the Markdown special characters is the underscore ( \\_ ), used as an alternate way to \\_italicize\\_ text: _italics_\n\nOf course, this creates a problem - if these characters are special and Markdown is always active, there's no way to use them as just normal characters, right?  To get around this dilemma, the specification provides an \"escape character\": the backslash ( \\\\ ).  To treat any special character as a normal one, the user has to add a backslash to the front of it: \\\\\\_not italics\\\\\\_\n\nThe shrugging arms emoticon features a backslash and a pair of underscores.  Perhaps you can see where this is going.  \n\n\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nThe left arm is a backslash.  Markdown sees that and says \"I will treat the underscore as a normal character now\".  It then hides the backslash, an escape character that has done its job.  Therefore, we're left with no arm: \n\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nThis is the most common result when people try to use the shrug emoticon on reddit, simply because Markdown works silently and the average user doesn't realize what's going on.  \n\nNow, some users know about backslash escapes, so they try to do the sensible thing: escape the backslash itself, like so: \u00af\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af  They're then greeted with this: \n\n\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nWhat the fuck, right?  This is just weird.  Behold, the second most common result of the shrug emoticon attempt.  The underscore is such a little-known special character that most people are completely caught off guard by this - even people who know about escape characters!  \n\nSo how do we preserve the shrug?  The somewhat clumsy solution: ESCAPE EVERYTHING.  At minimum, we'll need to kill the underscore *and* the backslash, breaking the pair needed to form italics: \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nThat's right.  Three backslashes in a row to get Markdown to lay off already.  \n\nUnfortunately, most people (especially those with no programming background) do not know how to use Markdown - if they even realize it exists in the first place.  So lists will keep getting compressed into a single line, single numbers will get turned into 1's, and the shrug will have its arms broken.  \n\nSo why doesn't reddit make Markdown opt-in, or do some kind of preview or warning when formatting characters are used?  \n\n\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af  Your guess is as good as mine!", "id": "d3imsac"}, {"comment": "2 questions: How do you make lists appear properly & did you turn off markdown for all those lines or just throw in a ton of hidden backslashes?

They disappear in the final comment if used as escape characters, so every backslash you see was written as a double.  Granted, I could also have written those parts in no-formatting \"code\" sections (delineated by tick marks ` or put on a line with 4 leading spaces) but I wanted to mystify a bit.
