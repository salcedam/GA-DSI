There's over 20,000 species of bee (more than birds, mammals, amphibian combined, I believe) so to say that \"the bees are dying!\" is sort of like saying \"the fish are all dying!\" While it's likely true for many populations and species, it's not true for all of them. The reality is, for the vast majority of bee species, just like the vast majority of species in general, we do not know what is happening to their populations. However, it's likely that things like habitat fragmentation, climate change, landscape changes, urbanization, and other ecological changes are causes declines and shifts in many species.

Primarily, efforts are centered on agricultural landscapes. \n\nParadoxically, intensive agricultural areas most need bees and are also unable to support natural populations of bees. In these areas our lab (and many others) are working towards increasing floral diversity by planting strips of locally adapted wildflowers and leaving other margins, where bees can nest, fallow. The trick here is making it worth a grower's time by ensuring that the pollination services they receive from the wildflower planting are greater than the time/cost of planting and maintenance. One of the things our lab does towards this end is determining which combination of plants gets you the most pollinators (in terms of species and abundance) for the least amount of money and time. \n\nFor wild populations in natural areas, many agencies are beginning to include pollinator conservation in their planning goals. These are a bit less obvious because you can't just leave a strip of wildflowers planted and call it a day. For these efforts, its more site-based and similar to how an agency might aim to conserve a particular species of bird or mammal. Ensuring there's corridors between habitat (often in this case, herbaceous patches of flowers), aiming to reduce forest encroachment where that's an issue, and many other local-knowledge type efforts. I'm being a bit vague here because your efforts in conserving bee populations in a coastal dune habitat are going to be quite different than in a subalpine meadow system.

Adult bees (aka the ones you see flying around) have all the material they will ever have, they do not grow anymore. \n\nAs for removing a foot, often when you catch the bees, they're already missing a foot, a wing is torn up, or they're otherwise damaged. They're tough and will keep doing their thing in spite of injuries. When folks have experimentally removed their \"foot\" (which is called a tarsus, by the way) they can still collect pollen no problem. Further, when you do it to an entire colony, that colony (a couple hundred workers for bumblebees) does just as well as the colonies with all of their feet. As such, folks have determined that a foot is enough genetic material to get good DNA replication, but not so much that it could harm sensitive species. \n\nI suppose as a further note, the alternative is to lethally sample (aka stick an entire bee in ethanol). This sounds bad when media headlines say, \"THE BEES ARE DYING!\" but really, you're removing a few individuals from colonies of hundreds, and populations of hundreds of thousands. Many bees die incidentally every day, and these incidental deaths are not the causes of species declines. Just like other species of plants and animals, the main causes of population decline (where they exist) are habitat fragmentation, shifting ranges, invasive species, and other indirect ecological costs.

Scientists used to think that they had circular orbits, but have discovered that things are much more complicated. Actually, the patterns of the electron within one of these orbitals takes into account Schroedinger\u2019s wave equations. Electrons occupy certain shells that surround the nucleus of the atom. These shells have been given letter names K,L,M,N,O,P,Q. They have also been given number names, such as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7(think quantum mechanics). Within the shell, there may exist subshells or orbitals, with letter names such as s,p,d,f. Some of these orbitals look like spheres, some like an hourglass, still others like beads. The K shell contains an s orbital called a 1s orbital. The L shell contains an s and p orbital called a 2s and 2p orbital. The M shell contains an s, p and d orbital called a 3s, 3p and 3d orbital. The N, O, P and Q shells each contain an s, p, d and f orbital called a 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 5f, 6s, 6p, 6d, 6f, 7s, 7p, 7d and 7f orbital. These orbitals also have various sub-orbitals. Each can only contain a certain number of electrons. A maximum of 2 electrons can occupy a sub-orbital where one has a spin of up, the other has a spin of down. There can not be two electrons with spin up in the same sub-orbital(the Pauli exclusion principal). Also, when you have a pair of electrons in a sub-orbital, their combined magnetic fields will cancel each other out. If you are confuse, you are not alone. Many people get lost here and just wonder about magnets instead of researching further.\n\nWhen you look at the ferromagnetic metals it is hard to see why they are so different form the elements next to them on the periodic table. It is generally accepted that ferromagnetic elements have large magnetic moments because of un-paired electrons in their outer orbitals. The spin of the electron is also thought to create a minute magnetic field. These fields have a compounding effect, so when you get a bunch of these fields together, they add up to bigger fields.\n\nTo wrap things up on \u2018how do magnets work?\u2019, the atoms of ferromagnetic materials tend to have their own magnetic field created by the electrons that orbit them. Small groups of atoms tend to orient themselves in the same direction. Each of these groups is called a magnetic domain. Each domain has its own north pole and south pole. When a piece of iron is not magnetized the domains will not be pointing in the same direction, but will be pointing in random directions canceling each other out and preventing the iron from having a north or south pole or being a magnet. If you introduce current(magnetic field), the domains will start to line up with the external magnetic field. The more current applied, the higher the number of aligned domains. As the external magnetic field becomes stronger, more and more of the domains will line up with it. There will be a point where all of the domains within the iron are aligned with the external magnetic field(saturation), no matter how much stronger the magnetic field is made. After the external magnetic field is removed, soft magnetic materials will revert to randomly oriented domains; however, hard magnetic materials will keep most of their domains aligned, creating a strong permanent magnet. So, there you have it.\n", "id": "dal735d"}, {"comment": "huh.", "id": "dal7in0"}, {"comment": "He said, \"Magic.\"", "id": "daldxlw"}, {"comment": "https://youtu.be/MO0r930Sn_8?t=3m57s", "id": "dalv6tz"}, {"comment": "I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

Another hint is that the electron dipole moment doesn't exist or is very small and so the electron is either a perfect sphere or smaller than 10^-30 meters. Another option for the size of an electron is the planck length of 10^-35m where black holes start to form and a quantum theory of gravity is required.\n\nUnfortunately though, like for many theoretical physics questions the only answer that can be given is that we need bigger particle accelerators to figure the answer out.", "id": "damr0xu"}, {"comment": "https://youtu.be/MO0r930Sn_8", "id": "dar9g6g"}, {"comment": "Watch casually explained magnets video, it explains it pretty well", "id": "dall673"}, {"comment": "That's awesome.

So I call his cell and he isn't picking up, so I go around to open his garage door and go in that way(had done this multiple times before this time). His room was in the basement so the garage was just outside his room. I could hear him talking to his girlfriend (why he wasn't answering) and just knocked on the door quietly and started saying his name, thinking he would just hop up and unlock the door and let me in.\n\nWell, all I could hear was him get super quiet, so I just knocked on the door quietly again calling his name, thinking he would know it was me and open the door. Instead, he starts screaming, runs up the stairs, and I could now hear LOUD steps coming from upstairs coming downstairs. I started freaking out, I didn't know what was going on, as soon as the door opened it was his dad in his underwear and I just started saying \"it's just (my name)!! it's just (my name)!!\". His dad looked obviously visibly pissed off but not that bad because he thought somebody was trying to break in or something.\n\nSOOOO, after all this went down and I finally got into the house, my friend comes back downstairs and explained what happened. He had just seen **The Grudge** with his girlfriend and was talking to her on the phone, and all he could hear was \"(his name), open the door!\" and me knocking on the door super quietly and he said he freaked the fuck out and started hysterically crying and running up the stairs to his parents room and then his dad came down like I explained above.\n\nI still give him shit about this incident to this day, and it's been like...12-13 years ago.

So apparently 'females' is now either clinical term or a derogatory word.

I feel like the world has somehow gotten more retarded overnight and I completely missed it. I mean to say this because a pretty neutral word appears to have been turned into an insult by both men and women (again, just do a search on Twitter for 'females') by nature of the misuse and abuse of the word.

Using the term \"man\" while using the term \"female\" denotes a difference in *one* sex--the female sex.\n\nIn the military, male soldiers refer to female soldiers as females; female soldiers refer to male soldiers as males. It is a two-way street. When men refer to women as \"females\" while women do not refer to men as \"males\", there is no a two-way street. \n\nIt is for this reason that I too find the terms male/female equalizing and empowering, but only in the appropriate context. It's actually kind of ironic in that I get quite offended by being referred to as anything other than female while in uniform (e.g. a male soldier holding a door open for me and saying \"ladies first\", the female latrine being called \"the ladies' room\"), and get offended by being referred to as a female while not in uniform.

You use something like this for batteries because you want them all to be oriented the same way and something like a vibration table and count slots wouldn't be perfect because the table could orient them terminals up or down fairly easily since the overall geometry is fairly symmetrical. [Something like rolls of tape is a good candidate for a vibration table or a conveyor with lanes and a laser for count.] So then you end up with a second sort. Probably a slotted shoot that would allow any batteries with the terminals down to drop the terminal depth then an angled piece to push the batteries that haven't been oriented terminals down back to the vibration table. Eventually you get them all but one poor bastard battery could draw the short straw and spend a week in the vibration table. \n\nPick and place robots are getting ridiculously cost competitive for many packaging applications. Lines that used to have 4-6 people manually picking and packaging then palatalizing cases can now be done with a few robots. Then you have robotic fork trucks pick up full pallets and drop them off in shipping. Most upgrades I have installed have about a 2 year pay back. \n\nThis set up is actually fairly simple from an inspection standpoint. I would add the grouping of only batteries that are logo up with only batteries that are logo down then have a flip station where the second robot could place the batteries to be flopped over before going down the second conveyor to packaging. \n\nSorry people, vote for UBI ;)", "id": "d02cmxy"}, {"comment": "Didn't think of them having a different up/down state, can see how that'd be pretty important", "id": "d02f358"}, {"comment": "..then who puts it on the other conveyor belt?", "id": "d022wh7"}, {"comment": "That's really fucking smart", "id": "d024lml"}, {"comment": "Does the first robot communicate the location of the stack to the second arm or does the second arm optically find the stack?

The zero was a fighter and had no other pacifist value.  But it was quite the airplane and did deserve its own movie but in no way is the lead character a moral or amoral observer in history.  He, along with many other scientists of Japan and the Third Reich, were spared because of the value in their research to the USA and Russia.

The higher the boiling point the less the compound will evaporate at room temp, the lower the boiling point the quicker it will evaporate at room temp. For example, acetone has a boiling point of 56 degrees Celsius, while water has a boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius. So we would expect acetone to evaporate much more quickly than water.

The minimum blood level for toxicity is around 0.05 mg per litre. So even though that's a big old bath of the stuff, he'd have to huff it like a bag of glue for while to be poisoned \n\nSo in a way you're right, but room ventilation would absolutely be required, because vapour mercury is just so damn dangerous  ", "id": "d9b5mc2"}, {"comment": "I know that it doesn't have to boil in order to turn to gas, which is why I said there's probably still some turning to gas at room temperature.

I only added the arms, and it was quite easy because the duck is already in a fixed position in the original GIF.  \n  \nI use Photoshop, and create top layers for the doodled art, and re-position/toggle these transparent layers wherever they need to be on a \u2018per frame\u2019 basis, in regards to what\u2019s happening in each frame of the original GIF.  Of course, if the facial expression needs to change or eyes need to blink, I create & use several different doodle layers throughout the course of any given GIF.

I just downloaded [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) at home (I\u2019m on a Mac), but I have yet to really test drive it.  I\u2019ve played with it a little, I think I can pick up on it.

I know there are more, but that was just the first I found really quick. I'm a contracter for NOAA that works on fishing boats, and one of the things i'm supposed to check is to make sure the water-tight doors are not held open with rope, because a lot of those doors stay open so deck crew can run in and out for work. If it gets in and floods the engine room, then the generators will die and you won't be able to run the bilge pumps to pump the water out or the ship will capsize from the distribution of weight. I've never been in seas this rough though, so I haven't had to be too worried yet, but if I am you'll be damn sure that i'm gonna check to make sure they're closed because there's a chance the crew doesn't know shit.\n\nEdit: Here you go, [the arctic rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQZysT5kJB8) is the one they tell us about, prime example of what goes wrong if you don't close the water tight doors and seas are rough.
