Got marked down a lot until I started strictly following the bare minimum IRAC format, which eliminated much of my interest in writing. It's so boring and formulaic and is just as uninteresting to read as it is to write.\n\nMy boss tore into me for recently trying to return to interesting writing that a judge might actually find worth reading, so I went back to stale and boring IRAC again. :/", "id": "d5k3ckj"}, {"comment": "They're trying to make smoother the transition into a fully automated justice system.", "id": "d5k3kxc"}, {"comment": "[May His Merciful Shadow fall upon you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFRe4nl8ugM&t=1320).", "id": "d5k88qt"}, {"comment": "Well there's a reference I didn't expect to see ever again.", "id": "d5k98ot"}, {"comment": "[*\"I AM THE LAW\"*](http://i.imgur.com/A85OFMS.gif)", "id": "d5kii3f"}, {"comment": "That kind of makes sense to me though.

Any more than that is fluff.\n\nThat's a valid point, but keep in mind that court filings like complaints, answers, motions, and appellate briefs can be VERY long and VERY dense. An appellate brief, for example, can be (and most often is) the maximum 60 pages long in federal court. By forcing every sentence to fit the IRAC mold, you're literally making the judge, as well as his law clerks, read an infuriatingly dry and boring tome on an area of law the judge might have no experience with. It's not much different than telling someone to sit down with their car's owner manual and read 60 pages of disjointed, complex points and statements, except you're also expecting them to understand it at the same level you and opposing counsel may so the judge will agree with you and adopt your conclusions.\n\nEngineering papers and reports, I assume, include tables, calculations, and graphics to make the content easier to understand. Legal writing, on the other hand, is almost 100% text with *extremely* few (if any) visuals included. Due to court rules, formatting, fonts, and text size are almost entirely standardized, so there's no variety available there either. Sure, you can use headings/bolded text/italics, but it doesn't do much to break up the monotony of 60 pages of solid, unbroken text on very complex issues that may have never been considered by a court before. Making it boring and difficult to follow does a disservice to your client.\n\nThe language doesn't need to be flowery, but rather just needs to add some variety and assist the reader. By adding in helpful signposting and prefatory paragraphs and language to put your arguments into a larger context, or even providing further analysis beyond the minimum one or two sentences, it adds a lot of substance to the document and makes it easier to digest. It also can help simplify more complex and fact-heavy analyses. Sometimes a single fact will generate multiple issues, which IRAC would force into several separate paragraphs.\n\nFor example, say a person supposedly agreed to a contract by nodding his head. Case A says acceptance must be unequivocal to be binding--is a nod unequivocal? What if he was simply nodding that he understood what the offer was (not that he was accepting it) or just doing it to move the conversation forward, a common habit performed by many people without thinking? What if his nod did signify his acceptance of the offer, but he misunderstood the terms of the offer so there was no \"meeting of the minds\" between the parties under Case B? Was his misunderstanding objectively reasonable, indicating there was not a valid contract under Case C? What if he nodded to signify his acceptance of the verbal offer, but the written offer presented to him afterward to memorialize the parties' understanding differed significantly?\n\nGranted, this analysis (only part of what the actual issues could be, and could include exceptions to contract formation, failure of consideration, etc.) would involve several different legal rules. As a result, it *could* be broken up into several different paragraphs. However, each issue/question arises from the same fact--the nod--so breaking them all up individually will result in a LOT of repetition and unnecessarily take up space and words, both of which are commodities in legal drafting since you are limited by page counts and/or word counts. Because of that, not breaking every potential issue into its own paragraph would save a lot of space and words that you could then use to raise additional arguments or shore up weaker arguments you've already made.\n\nI'm not saying the IRAC method isn't helpful and even a good starting point, but deferring to it in every instance as the end-all-be-all of legal writing will likely cost you some verdicts and, with those verdicts, money and clients.", "id": "d5kafye"}, {"comment": "Maybe write stories or something in your off time and see if that goes anywhere?", "id": "d5k6ig3"}, {"comment": "That's a good idea, and would help me deal with a lot of my work stress.

", "id": "d4ucygc"}, {"comment": "My mother was a well-known prostitute back in her prime, but she quit when she found out she was pregnant with me.  I hold her in extremely high regard and I believe she sets the standard for mothers everywhere.  The only thing she was reluctant to give me was information about my father \u2013 a topic she absolutely refused to comment on.  As a high-profile hooker, she had been rolling with quite a few influential people \u2013 and for a long time I fantasized myself a child of an oil merchant or a Fortune 500 CEO who would drive by our flat one day in his Porsche and take us away for a fancy meal or weekend or something before dumping us back where we belonged because from a young age I\u2019ve been a realist and I knew that it was impossible for any sane rich person to care about the poor.  When I was in middle school, and just starting to learn about sex, my mother suddenly became very comfortable with nudity around the house, and she would often strut around our flat wearing nothing but a pair of socks.  I think this is because she had some suspicions that I was a closeted homosexual (as a devout Christian she obviously viewed this as an unnatural abomination) and so she tried very hard to invoke some sort of interest for the female body in me (which is a very noble, self-sacrificing act).  But the first time I saw her in the nude I was so stricken with fear that I sprung a boner (which always happens when I become terrified) and collapsed on the floor, where I began to convulse.  At the time my social studies class was covering a unit on the Holocaust, and in a bit of zealous interest (which is rare for me) I had researched quite a bit on the Fuhrer \u2013 and read a few articles on how he was not, in fact, dead, but was instead gallivanting all over America (where he had successfully escaped to).  Thus when I saw his iconic moustache branded on my mothers crotch my little mind broke.  After all, Higgins sounds remarkably like an Anglicized bastardization of Hitler, so it did not take much more evidence to convince myself that he had fathered me.  It took me many years of therapy and counseling to rid myself of my panic attacks, and this was not helped by the fact that my mother never told me I was wrong in my conviction.", "id": "d4uu8rw"}, {"comment": "k", "id": "d4uucnn"}, {"comment": "Where the hell is the Tree-fiddy?", "id": "d4uuot0"}, {"comment": "me too thanks", "id": "d4uuub5"}, {"comment": "Va..Vargas?", "id": "d4ux1mt"}, {"comment": "God damn it WyattHiggins!

The camp was pretty boring overall, we went to a little cabin complex and did like two hikes over three days then headed back to the city. While I don't remember much from that trip there is one memory that has been burned in my mind. Every evening we'd all line up to use the single shower that was in each cabin complex. The cabins were split by sex and there was about 20-30 kids per cabin. So picture thirty little boys wrapped in towels standing in a single file line in the middle of a big living room. So the first kid in the shower this fateful day slips like a moron and cracks his stupid skull on the ground. He'd screaming his head off and bleeding everywhere while our cabin counselor is flipping his shit making sure this kid isn't dead. In any event he picks the kid up, runs him to the office, and on the way out yells \"If anybody moves you're expelled, I'll be right back\". \n\nSo now there is twenty nine of us all in a line, naked in towels, with no adult supervision. It's quiet for a bit while we stare at our feet but then one little black boy decided to immortalize himself. He walks to the front of the room and says \"Excuse me everyone. Excuse me, can I have your attention please.\" All of us immediately stare at him as he proceeds with the second part of his announcement. \"I just wanted to let you know, that I cook better than you. I look better than you. AND MY DICK IS BIGGER THAN YOURS!!\" At that moment he rips his towel off and starts helicoptering with speed and agility that could rival that of meatspin dot com. So this kid is running around in circle in the cabin while simultaneously helicoptering his dick while we all visually confirm whether his statement was true or not (it was) when our counselor got back. \n\nLong story short counselor was mortified, kid got suspended, and from that moment on that kid was a legend. Wish I knew where he was now, probably helicoptering for other gleeful masses. Or maybe he owns a restaurant.

The camp was pretty boring overall, we went to a little cabin complex and did like two hikes over three days then headed back to the city. While I don't remember much from that trip there is one memory that has been burned in my mind. Every evening we'd all line up to use the single shower that was in each cabin complex. The cabins were split by sex and there was about 20-30 kids per cabin. So picture thirty little boys wrapped in towels standing in a single file line in the middle of a big living room. So the first kid in the shower this fateful day slips like a moron and cracks his stupid skull on the ground. He'd screaming his head off and bleeding everywhere while our cabin counselor is flipping his shit making sure this kid isn't dead. In any event he picks the kid up, runs him to the office, and on the way out yells \"If anybody moves you're expelled, I'll be right back\". \n\nSo now there is twenty nine of us all in a line, naked in towels, with no adult supervision. It's quiet for a bit while we stare at our feet but then one little black boy decided to immortalize himself. He walks to the front of the room and says \"Excuse me everyone. Excuse me, can I have your attention please.\" All of us immediately stare at him as he proceeds with the second part of his announcement. \"I just wanted to let you know, that I cook better than you. I look better than you. AND MY DICK IS BIGGER THAN YOURS!!\" At that moment he rips his towel off and starts helicoptering with speed and agility that could rival that of meatspin dot com. So this kid is running around in circle in the cabin while simultaneously helicoptering his dick while we all visually confirm whether his statement was true or not (it was) when our counselor got back. \n\nLong story short counselor was mortified, kid got suspended, and from that moment on that kid was a legend. Wish I knew where he was now, probably helicoptering for other gleeful masses. Or maybe he owns a restaurant.

You suture closed incisions the surgeon made. You drive the camera in laparosopic and thorascopic surgeries. You do this again in your fourth year of medical school.\n\nThen you do a general surgery residency for five years. Your responsibilities are gradually increased month by month to give you more autonomy. At the end, you're fully qualified to operate independently.\n\nBut then you do a CT fellowship for two to three more years. Your responsibilities are again gradually increased month by month to give you more autonomy until you're fully qualified to operate independently on the heart.\n\nDuring all this time, there's an attending physician in the room with you to catch your hand the second you make a mistake.

Saying something like Taiwan #1 is just one of the many versions, like US #1 or Japan #1, which is spammed to mock them.\n\n>It's actually quite a racist community on both sides.

I see you when you\u2019re sleeping, and I know when you\u2019re awake, I can make and check lists at the same time, and that\u2019s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in reindeer play, but I have access to the entire toy catalogue of Hasbro, Mattel, and Lego combined, and I will use them to their full extent to make your Christmas wishes fall apart like a snow fort in the rain. If only you could have known what festive retribution your little \u201cnaughty\u201d comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your sooty tongue. But you couldn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t, and now you\u2019re paying the mistletoe price. I will drip frosting all over you and you will drown in it.

Sportacus has a Number 10 on his shirt, a small detail that most viewers will probably forget. However, it has stated that the Number Ten means something, but I'll get to that later. Let's start with the first episode of LazyTown. A brief summary of it is that Stephanie,the main character, moves into LazyTown to visit her uncle, Mayor Milford Meanswell. She meets other kids in the town, Trixie, Stingy, Pixel, and Ziggy, who's personalities are identical to their name. Robbie Rotten is also there in his secret lair, keep note of this, He looks around the town to see weeds, an abandoned basketball court, and other very polluted things. He seems content about this, proclaiming he will keep LazyTown the laziest town on the world. Later on, Stephanie talks to her uncle about how none of the kids want to go outside to play. Her uncle then tells her that there was a man with a Number 9 on his shirt, who made kids active. Wait, 9? But Sportacus has Number 10 on his shirt! Was this careless mistake? Or something more different? Stephanie makes a letter to said person, and goes to the mailbox to send it. She finds a cork inside the tube and tries pulling it out. Robbie is then shown stopping in his tracks and is visibly distraught about this, meaning he knows what is going to happen when she sends that letter. She pulls the cork out and puts the tube like envelope into the pipe, and it soon gets launched into the sky, and is received by Sportacus. Sportacus jumps down to meet Stephanie, she asks him if he is Number 9 and he responds with that he is Number 10. Robbie than says \"Another one?\" Confirming the fact that there was a Number 9, and Robbie fought him aswell. Think about it, at the start of the episode Robbie already has his signature secret lair. However, he doesn't use it for evil, he doesn't terrorize the citizens of LazyTown, he likes the citizens how they are, lazy. So, why would he have this lair, unless he had to use it against Number 9? Then the question remains, where is Number 9? Did he leave? Did he accomplish his goal, move away and then Robbie made it lazy again? Or did Robbie Rotten beat Number 9? Think about it, why would he use the schemes he uses on Sportacus and friends if they didn't prove successful against Number 9? So we got that Robbie Rotten beat Number 9 and made LazyTown lazy, but that also strikes up another question. Are there more numbers? Are Number 9 and Sportacus apart of a group that ride blimps and help make kids exercise and play outside? Now are you ready for the biggest stretch in this entire theory?\n\nRobbie Rotten was the first Sportacus-like member of this group. Why so? Well Robbie admits it himself.\n\nIn a little known song called \"We Are Number One.\"\n\nTL;DR Robbie Rotten was the first Sportacus who eventually turned evil and defeated Number 9, making Lazytown lazy.\n"], [9, "Powdered donuts make me go nuts"], [6, "This sub is just the tits some times."], [3, "I'm getting an ABBA vibe here."], [3, "Those donuts are powdered, not glazed, you fuckin imbecile"], [3, "I've seen some things\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/VgtB3"], [3, "http://i.imgur.com/16GrVjp.gif"], [3, "Ah, I've got a Walnut-brownie-brain and Molasses in my veins, crushed graham cracker crust, my powdered Sugar funnelcake cocaine.\n\nLet the Crescent Cookie rise!\n\nThese Carob-colored Almond eyes would rest to see my Cashew Princess in the Swirling Marble Sky.\n\nWe'll rest upon the Knee where all divisions cease to be and rootbeer float in our Banana Boat across the Tapioca Sea."], [2, "But those donuts are clearly powdered-sugar'd."], [2, ">420 glaze it\n\nThose are clearly powdered donuts."], [2, "This is my best friend's cover photo on Facebook "], [2, "Wow, best one in decades\n"], [2, "I'm in a ceramics class and I may or may not have tried to make this joke."], [1, "Elisha Cuthbert's career has apparently taken a big dive."], [1, "missed a chance to say stay off the powder and cake"], [1, "/r/wtfstockphotos"], [1, "Daryl Hannah?"], [1, "r/wtfstockphotos"], [1, "This is great"], [1, "Daryl Hannah has really lost it."], [1, "Fucking Pam."], [1, "It's Pam from Archer!"], [0, "replace model with amy schumer and we have a sell"], [0, "...What the fuck.

Sportacus has a Number 10 on his shirt, a small detail that most viewers will probably forget. However, it has stated that the Number Ten means something, but I'll get to that later. Let's start with the first episode of LazyTown. A brief summary of it is that Stephanie,the main character, moves into LazyTown to visit her uncle, Mayor Milford Meanswell. She meets other kids in the town, Trixie, Stingy, Pixel, and Ziggy, who's personalities are identical to their name. Robbie Rotten is also there in his secret lair, keep note of this, He looks around the town to see weeds, an abandoned basketball court, and other very polluted things. He seems content about this, proclaiming he will keep LazyTown the laziest town on the world. Later on, Stephanie talks to her uncle about how none of the kids want to go outside to play. Her uncle then tells her that there was a man with a Number 9 on his shirt, who made kids active. Wait, 9? But Sportacus has Number 10 on his shirt! Was this careless mistake? Or something more different? Stephanie makes a letter to said person, and goes to the mailbox to send it. She finds a cork inside the tube and tries pulling it out. Robbie is then shown stopping in his tracks and is visibly distraught about this, meaning he knows what is going to happen when she sends that letter. She pulls the cork out and puts the tube like envelope into the pipe, and it soon gets launched into the sky, and is received by Sportacus. Sportacus jumps down to meet Stephanie, she asks him if he is Number 9 and he responds with that he is Number 10. Robbie than says \"Another one?\" Confirming the fact that there was a Number 9, and Robbie fought him aswell. Think about it, at the start of the episode Robbie already has his signature secret lair. However, he doesn't use it for evil, he doesn't terrorize the citizens of LazyTown, he likes the citizens how they are, lazy. So, why would he have this lair, unless he had to use it against Number 9? Then the question remains, where is Number 9? Did he leave? Did he accomplish his goal, move away and then Robbie made it lazy again? Or did Robbie Rotten beat Number 9? Think about it, why would he use the schemes he uses on Sportacus and friends if they didn't prove successful against Number 9? So we got that Robbie Rotten beat Number 9 and made LazyTown lazy, but that also strikes up another question. Are there more numbers? Are Number 9 and Sportacus apart of a group that ride blimps and help make kids exercise and play outside? Now are you ready for the biggest stretch in this entire theory?\n\nRobbie Rotten was the first Sportacus-like member of this group. Why so? Well Robbie admits it himself.\n\nIn a little known song called \"We Are Number One.\"\n\nTL;DR Robbie Rotten was the first Sportacus who eventually turned evil and defeated Number 9, making Lazytown lazy.\n", "id": "dai9zhy"}, {"comment": "hello block of unread text.", "id": "daiaotj"}, {"comment": "That was the greatest thing ive ever read", "id": "daidakt"}, {"comment": "That was beautiful.", "id": "daj5xsp"}], [{"comment": "Powdered donuts make me go nuts", "id": "daidi4c"}, {"comment": "Business cat approves ", "id": "daimwgx"}], [{"comment": "This sub is just the tits some times.", "id": "dais8zs"}], [{"comment": "I'm getting an ABBA vibe here.", "id": "dai9w52"}], [{"comment": "Those donuts are powdered, not glazed, you fuckin imbecile", "id": "daic0sc"}], [{"comment": "I've seen some things\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/VgtB3", "id": "daifcnt"}], [{"comment": "http://i.imgur.com/16GrVjp.gif", "id": "daikood"}, {"comment": "I actually finished watching Nise 2 weeks ago, and yeah, that was a great episode.
