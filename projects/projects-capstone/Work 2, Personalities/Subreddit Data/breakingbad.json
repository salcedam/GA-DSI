In Ingress, this became \"ambient XM\"\u2014the \"energy\" that powers your scanner device.

I and I know many, many others, are hoping that the popularity of PoGo allows them to reopen this dialogue, either just for Ingress players (much smaller input base) or for PoGo players as well, but if they open it up to PoGo players there's going to be a damn near instant backlog of up to 1 month+ from the sheer amount of portal submissions/reports.", "id": "d56o457"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the reply--the mechanics of PoGo were a total mystery to me.

They're not great XP and they'll just make you waste potions, revives, and\u2014most importantly\u2014time.\n\nIf you're really interested in doing the gym thing, then take a look at the shop, or the golden pikachu icon from your avatar screen. You'll notice a timer in the upper right hand. If at the time that timer reaches 0 (which is once per day, in the dead of night where I'm at), for every pokemon you have in a gym you get 10 coins to use in the store. Not a lot, but hey, it's something; so the best time to try to take a gym is usually late at night for me (but again, personal safety above all things: 10 coins is *not* worth going to some skeezy part of town at 3 in the morning when there's a chance the gym's going to fall after you take it over anyways).\n\nOther than that, the best way to do the gym thing is to coordinate with other locals from your team and try to get a level 4 or 5 gym set up. If you can get a few other locals to coordinate and throw in, then you can set up a pretty powerful gym that'll be more difficult to knock down if you're in a more rural area. Is it possible to take on gyms solo? Yeah, sure, but if you take it over, it won't stand for long. As with Ingress, players operating in tandem with one another will have a leg up on all but the most powerful solo players.\n\nIncense is also a totally independent-of-mechanics thing. From what I can tell, like a lure, it'll just make pokemon spawn around you at a relatively regular rate. You can sit in one place, pop an Incense, and get 2-3 pokemon over the course of a half hour.\n\nPokemon you find \"in the wild\" (by walking around and such) are visible to everyone, and are not individual. You can walk around with a partner, and if, say, a Weedle pops up, you and the person you're with will not only both see it, but both be able to capture it. If one of you pops an incense, however, the pokemon that come to that player will only be visible and capturable by that player.\n\nLures, however, work for everyone, and a pokemon that pops up because of a lure will, again, be visible and capturable by everyone near that lure.", "id": "d56rbrb"}, {"comment": "WOW thank you.

Right now, \"can I even capture this gym?\" is more a question of server stability than player ability (hah. I rhymed).\n\nI still honestly don't think it's worth it to make capturing gyms a solo player's *modus operendi* unless you're way out in a rural area and don't think you'll get much competition. Even then, if you *are* out in a rural area, finding players of a different team should be a source of joy because, hey, you're finding other players! Share with them your locations of rarespawn; the game, ultimately, is about personal progress and getting out to find new and exciting places in your home town, to take a second look at places you might've passed a thousand times before. The gym stuff is, I dunno, like a thermometer or something; you just use it to check how you're doing as a trainer at that moment.\n\nI actually really like what they did with gyms because in Ingress, every portal has the same potential value, whether it's some lazy player's \"reimagining\" of the Panda Express sign or a several hundred-year-old monument. I don't know how everyone else's are, but in my city, the gyms are (for the most part) standout locations. Like, I'm in New Orleans\u2014St. Louis Cathedral is a gym. I think that's *awesome*. In Ingress, it's just another portal, no more or less than a little mural taking up the tiniest shred of a building side. Like, you can fight Pokemon in St. Louis Cathedral!

So it has a giant cast of characters, many of whom never meet, and the closest thing the show has to a central character is still pretty far from a \"main character\" most of the time.\n\nFor the most part, The Wire is pretty non-tropey, and can almost trick you into think you're watching a documentary some times. Its arguably worst season (which is still a pretty great season of television (I'm talking about season 5, not 2 you heathens!)) is such mostly because it feels like you're just watching normal TV with more traditional set ups and payoffs than The Wire's typically more ambiguous grey morality and tone of \"...and things just keep on they way they are...\"\n\nWhereas BB is the story of the fall (and arguably, rise) of one man. Breaking Bad is the story of Walter White, the world's effects on him, and his effects on the world. I don't need to tell you what BB is all about.\n\nDues to these differences, I generally just consider them both to be \"the best television show ever\" and appreciate that they were never really trying to accomplish the same thing.

I give The Sopranos the edge though because of it's complexity. At it's core it was about the mafia, but it also dealt with actual real life issues - separate from the mafia - that were just as interesting and entertaining as the mafia power struggles. It dived pretty deep into some heavy issues such as cultural identity, race relations, religion, parental relationships, divorce, rape and sexual assault, homosexuality, terrorism, etc. And it was all so well done that sometimes you could get the feeling that the mafia was just a minor backdrop to it all.\n\nBreaking Bad was also an amazing show, but in comparison to The Sopranos a bit one dimensional in that without the meth there is nothing else to really drive the story. This isn't a criticism against Breaking Bad though since pretty much every show is one dimensional in this sense. Breaking Bad is wildly entertaining, but just not as believable and real as The Sopranos was.\n\n", "id": "d7ywtu9"}], [{"comment": "Having watched all but the last season of The Wire, I have to say that BB is easily a better show.", "id": "d7y9dqu"}], [{"comment": "I'd agree, but my number 1 is Tinker Tailor, and my second is Traffik.", "id": "d7yq8fx"}], [{"comment": "How the fuck is Family Guy not even on this list???", "id": "d7zghxd"}], [{"comment": "If wire ended at s4 id agree, but s5 was horrible", "id": "d7yb7id"}]]], "3xjgpu": ["Such a good scene and throw.", "2015-12-20 06:32:36", 1206, "http://i.imgur.com/qR2gaXO.gif", [[292, "Reminds me of why I subscribed to this sub...http://i.imgur.com/iY4jeTE.jpg"], [78, "I believe that was filmed in only one take.

It's a known fact in psychiatry that drug addiction tends to make people forget about their basic hygiene unless they are prompted or incentivized to do so. Even then the high from meth and many other drugs can overcome those incentives if they aren't strong enough (perhaps giving meth users meth if they brush their teeth is a \"lesser of two evils\" incentive).\n\nThat being said it is possible to maintain one's teeth during meth use. If they strictly maintain dental care and keep their mouth at normal moisture levels.  Maybe do your meth near a humidifier or carry a bottle of water around whenever you are snorting that ice, remember to sip it. \n\nThe fact is that responsible drug use is possible. Just very difficult and if you don't have the discipline ahead of time, you better go get it or you end up like this guy. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meth_mouth#/media/File:Suspectedmethmouth09-19-05.jpg"], [3, "I've read once that a lot of the bad effects Meth has on your body come from contamination due to the cheap and unhygienic illegal production."], [2, "It's the same way with the tv show Vikings.

There's only so many times even loved ones can go through the addict cycle before they don't believe it will ever stop.  The final option does seem to be to let go and hope for the best.\n\nThe show seems to get across that they've been down this road for quite a while and just want to live a relatively normal life.  I understand to a certain point because not only do they have another child to raise, but Jesse is quite old enough to figure his own way out.  \n\nSeeing him clean and letting him back into their lives was probably a mistake they've made one too many times.  You can tell by the way Jesse comes home and starts getting right into old routines, and trying to fit into the family where he doesn't (setting the table, hanging with his brother, the awkwardness etc).  \n\nYou can't blame his parents for wanting to sell his aunts house before he burned it to the ground or otherwise destroyed it.\n\nPeople tend to hate on his parents, but realistically, they ended up being right in every sense.

If you pay attention the time when Jesse crashes at home for a bit his little brother is being smothered in this perfect little fake fantasy land that the parents seem to be striving him into. On the outside to them he seems fine and successful in school and happy but alone he confides to Jesse that he resents the attention they still give him, even when he's not living there. Jesse is surprised by this fact. Clearly neither parent is good at showing real love and affection. And also. Of course the brother is hiding his use of weed from the parents. So, while in the overt issue of Jesse's drug use yes the parents really\n aren't at fault for trying and washing their hands of him, they clearly are at least partially responsible for Jessie looking to drugs in the first place, due to their parenting habits.

", "id": "d2t2nt0"}, {"comment": "I always measured Jesse's parents against Donald Margolis. Both were parents dealing with addict children, but the way they handled the situation was miles apart. Donald gives his daughter a place to live but gives her the responsibility of managing his property. He goes to her meetings with her, absorbs what the other addicts have to say, monitors his daughter while at the same time giving her space. He gives her chance after chance because she's his daughter and as he says, what else is there but family? Why *wouldn't* he stop trying? She's his daughter.\n\nThe Pinkmans, on the other side, were a look at parents that enacted what they imagined to be 'tough love' without really considering an alternative approach. Dad is very adamant that 'we're not doing this again'. His references to drugs are outdated. Neither he or Mrs. Pinkman have a clue what Jesse is even using. They seem pretty removed from his life, as if him living in Ginny's house is out of sight, out of mind. Tiger Dad Pinkman is very, very focused on Jake's academic progress, as well as the 'right' extracurricular activities that will look good on a resume. But Jesse obviously exhibited a flair for artistic ability from a very young age and it was not something that appeared to be encouraged. The best that Adam Pinkman can come up with is 'data entry' for Jesse. One joint sends them into a meltdown. Jesse refers to an intervention when they meet him at the lawyer's but it seems as if the intervention came about more for pot use than anything else. Jesse uses meth, but he appears to be able to partake in moderate doses when we first meet him. He goes overboard when he's stressed, and that happens more frequently once he starts associating with Walt.\n\nAnyway, I always loved this scene because I felt Jesse earned it.

Sure he has his moments (like any realistic character), but these moments are few and far between. I can only think of 4 instances even really count as \"piece of shit\" actions on Jesse's part, and he has more screen time throughout the series than anyone but Walt. Jesse blows all of Walt's money and helps steal Combo's mother's RV, but Walt gave his that money to someone he barely knows and has no reason to trust. Walt was also blackmailing Jesse into getting an RV and helping him cook meth. Jesse was an accomplice to blackmailing Walt, but it was technically his money. He kills Gale, but hey, it's a show about drug dealers, and Gale is a meth cook. Finally, Jesse tries to sell meth to people at a meth help group, but if you sell meth, *you are almost always selling to addicts*, and once again, it's a show about meth dealers. These 4 incidents are the only occasions I can think of when Jesse doesn't have a great moral compass. Other than this, Jesse never intentionally fucks over anyone who didn't have it coming to them. He is a junkie half the show, but rarely does harm to anyone, and for the most part, strives to do what he thinks is right.  \n\n Jesse has these 4 instances of POS behavior, but his family acts this way towards their own son during every second of screen time they have. Their estranged son comes back into their lives after who knows how long, obviously needing help. Jesse's parents are jaded by past experiences with their oldest son, and immediately after taking him in, they start discussing whether or not to kick him out. If Jesse were some kind of threat to them, I would totally understand if they confronted him in the back yard and told him to find somewhere else to go right then and there, but they invite him in. Then, while their son sleeps off his meth binge, they start trying to get rid of him as soon as it's apparent that he's not just really tired.  \n\n The Pinkman family is well off enough to be able to send their younger son to an expensive and prestigious-sounding private school, and they don't seem to be struggling at all. In fact, I get the impression that they are doing pretty well financially. As soon as Jesse comes back into their lives, they suddenly find that they really need to sell the house he's currently living in. It's almost as if they forgot that the deed was in their name. I understand cutting out a toxic family member, but there is no obvious financial need for the Pinkmans to do this, and I can't really see how it would be in Jesse's best interest. *Maybe* if they said he had to leave, go to rehab, and he would have the house when he got back, or maybe some of the proceeds from its sale, but there is nothing like that here. The Pinkmans don't just want Jesse out of their lives, they don't want to help him in any way.  \n\n This is my problem with the Pinkmans. None of them show love for Jesse. Not one single conversation with Jesse or among themselves shows the smallest bit of compassion for Jesse. Jake sees his brother for the first time in years (most likely). He doesn't seem legitimately concerned that his joint put his brother and parents at odds, he just wants his joint back. Mr. and Mrs. Pinkman don't talk about what's best for their struggling son, only themselves. If they were just jaded by their oldest screwing them over again and again, I would understand. This is not just how the Pinkman family tries to themselves, however. The Pinkmans don't want to have anything to do with their son. They don't even want him to come over for dinner just to socialize. Not only did they give up on helping their son, but they have stopped loving him.   \n\n**TL;DR:** It's like Donald Margolis (Jane's dad) says: \"You can't give up on family. *Never.* I mean, what else is there?\"", "id": "d2q6kzd"}, {"comment": "He obviously put them through hell and they ended up being completely right about how he turned out.", "id": "d2qlxk0"}], [{"comment": "May be my favorite scene of the entire show.\n", "id": "d2pztub"}], [{"comment": "It's another example of how we root for people who are just not good people.\n\nI mean, Jesse is nice enough, but he's a meth dealer.

Maybe she\u2019d fallen back asleep. Then suddenly vomit flooded her mouth. She grasped at the sheets. She was choking. I instinctively reached to turn her over. \n\nBut I stopped myself. \n\nWhy should I save her? This little junkie, Jane, was threatening to blackmail me, expose my enterprise to the police, destroy everything I had worked for, and wipe out the financial life preserver I was trying to leave my family\u2014the only legacy I could leave them. \n\nShe gurgled, searching for a gasp of air. Her eyes rolled back in her head. I felt a stab of guilt. Goddamn it, she\u2019s just a girl. Do something. \n\nBut if I stepped in now, wasn\u2019t I just delaying the inevitable? Don\u2019t they all at some point end up dead? And poor dumb comatose Jesse, my partner, lying beside her. She\u2019s the one who got him on this shit in the first place. She\u2019d kill them both, kill us all, if I stepped in now and played God. \n\nI told myself: just stay out of it. When he wakes he\u2019ll discover this tragedy\u2014this accident\u2014on his own. Yes, it\u2019s sad. All death is sad. But he\u2019ll get over it in time. He\u2019ll get past this like every other bad thing that\u2019s happened to us. That\u2019s what humans do. We heal. We move on. A few months from now he\u2019ll barely remember her. He\u2019ll find another girlfriend, and he\u2019ll be fine. Fuck it. We all have to move on. \n\nI\u2019ll just pretend I wasn\u2019t here. \n\nBut I am here. And she\u2019s a human being. \n\nOh God. What have I become? \n\nAnd then, somehow, as she was fading, she wasn\u2019t herself anymore. I wasn\u2019t looking at Jane, or Jesse\u2019s girlfriend, or the actor Krysten Ritter. I was looking at Taylor, my daughter, my real daughter. I wasn\u2019t Walter White anymore. I was Bryan Cranston. And I was seeing my daughter die. \n\nFrom the moment she was born in 1993\u2014a bit premature, shy of seven pounds, impossibly beautiful\u2014I felt an instant, radical, unconditional love that redefined love. I had never allowed myself to imagine losing her. But now, I was seeing it. Clearly. Vividly. She was slipping from me. She was dying. \n\nThat was not the plan. When I do the homework for such a delicate scene, I don\u2019t make a plan. My goal when I prepare isn\u2019t to plot out each action and reaction, but to think: What are the possible emotional levels my character could experience? I break the scene down into moments or beats. By doing that work ahead of time, I leave a number of possibilities available to me. I stay open to the moment, susceptible to whatever comes. \n\nThe homework doesn\u2019t guarantee anything; with luck, it gives you a shot at something real. \n\nIt was real fear that gripped me\u2014my worst fear. A fear I hadn\u2019t fully expected or come to terms with. And my reaction is there, forever, at the end of that scene. I gasp, and my hand moves to my mouth in horror. \n\nWhen the director, Colin Bucksey, said, \u201cCut,\u201d I was weeping. Deep racking sobs. I explained to the people on set what had happened, what I had seen. Michael Slovis, our cinematographer, embraced me. My castmates, too. I remember in particular Anna Gunn, who played my wife, Skyler. I hugged her. I must have held on for five minutes. Poor Anna. \n\nAnna knew. As an actor she has a fragility at her core, and she often had a hard time shedding her character\u2019s emotions after shooting difficult scenes. \n\nThat will happen in an actor\u2019s life, and it happened to me that day. It was the most harrowing scene I did on Breaking Bad, and really . . . ever. \n\nIt may seem odd. It may even seem ghoulish. To stand in a room packed with people and lights and cameras and pretend I\u2019m letting a girl choke to death. And then to see my daughter\u2019s face in lieu of that girl. And to call that work. To call that your job. \n\nBut it\u2019s not odd to me. Actors are storytellers. And storytelling is the essential human art. It\u2019s how we understand who we are. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to make it sound high-flown. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s discipline and repetition and failure and perseverance and dumb luck and blind faith and devotion. It\u2019s showing up when you don\u2019t feel like it, when you\u2019re exhausted and you think you can\u2019t go on. Transcendent moments come when you\u2019ve laid the groundwork and you\u2019re open to the moment. They happen when you do the work. In the end, it\u2019s about the work. \n\nEvery day on Breaking Bad I\u2019d wake up about 5:30 and have coffee, take a shower, get dressed. Some days I was so tired, I didn\u2019t know whether I was coming or going. \n\nI\u2019d drive the nine miles from my condo in Nob Hill to Q Studios, five miles south of the airport in Albuquerque\u2014ABQ as the locals call it. I\u2019d be in the makeup chair by 6:30. I\u2019d shave my head anew. Knock down the nubs. It didn\u2019t take too long for makeup. By 7:00 a.m. we\u2019d see everyone: the other actors, the crew. Then we\u2019d start rehearsing. \n\nThe allotment was a twelve-hour shoot. Plus a one-hour lunch. So a normal day was thirteen hours. It was very rare that the day was shorter. Occasionally, it was longer. Some days went seventeen hours. A lot of it had to do with whether we were on location. \n\nIf it was just a minimum day, we\u2019d wrap at 8:00 p.m. Then I\u2019d grab a sandwich and apple for the road. I didn\u2019t want to take the time to stop. I\u2019d call my wife, Robin, from the car. How are you? Yeah, long day. I\u2019d see how she was doing. I\u2019d ask about Taylor. I\u2019d still be talking to her when I walked into the house. I\u2019d say goodnight and then have that sandwich while looking over what we were doing the next day. I\u2019d take a hot bath with a little glass of red wine. Then I\u2019d hit the sack. \n\nBut even before the drive home, every night after we finished, I\u2019d go in the hair and makeup trailer and take two hot, wet towels that my friends in the makeup department had presoaked, and I\u2019d drape one over my head and I\u2019d wrap the other over my face.

Unfortunately, failing to show that death on-screen, and leaving it until episode 701 is a cheap cop out, that not only does not evoke the feelings towards the aforementioned character that is both so characteristic to readers of the comics, but is also what the showrunners wanted in the first place. What we get instead is fans who are not comic readers going \"oh, this character is pretty badass, and totally just killed someone. I can't wait to find out who it is\" and that fan favourite's death simply becomes a stepping stone to the next season in an attempt to garner more viewership.\n\nSorry about my little rant.

Getting ted hospitalized, telling Walt to kill Jesse) \n\nAll the hate Skylar gets completely misses the point, imo. Skylar resists the whole 'murderous drug dealer' thing until she is absolutely convinced she has no choice if she wants to protect her kids. Even then, she sends them to Hank's to shelter them. Even telling Walt to kill Jesse, she only does that after being forced into that 'criminal' reality, for however long. IMO, it was kind of half trying to protect her family, half a kind of 'stockholm syndrome'.\n\nWalt *starts off* all about providing for his family, but ends up addicted to the power and lifestyle, refusing to get out, even when he had way too much money.\n\nThe other contender for 'true hero' is Hank. But he isn't really trying to 'do the right thing'; he just feels personally betrayed and humiliated Walt was under his nose so long. He's just petty and egotistical, like a macho version of Marie's petty self-righteousness to Walt and Skylar.\n\nBut really, there are no 'heros', the whole story is just how Walt inadvertently becomes a villain. All the other characters are there to help that story progress, show the effects of WW's actions, or contrast to him.

[I even wrote a post about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/2od6sf/so_dr_doom_is_getting_an_awful_lot_of_love_from/) way back when.\n\nFor the best \"Doom as bad guy\" material I think you can look no further than Jon Hickman's stuff. Now Hickman has been known to imbue Doom with a sympathetic side, but 2015's *Secret Wars* casts ol' Victor in the role he was born to play- a psychotic God King with absolute dominion over the Marvel Universe. He revels in his megalomania, he enslaves heros and villains alike, he kicks a fuck ton of ass, and he spouts some unforgettable one-liners along the way. SW was listed on [dorkly.com's Doom favorites](http://www.dorkly.com/post/75943/doctor-doom-comics) at #6, though I think its relative recency is a part of this and history will bear it out as one of Doom's all time best roles in the MU.\n\nDr Doom is the quintessential idea of the brilliant misanthrope who believes in, *is sure of,* the fact that the universe would be a better place with him running things- *absolutely.* And the coolest thing about Marvel is that we actually get to see that happen from time to time.\n\nAlso, Doom FUCKING HATES Reed Richards. It's his undoing over and over and over again. His obsession with F4 is as disturbing as it is entertaining, and he's constantly devising increasingly creative ways to stick it to them. This hatred has taken him all over the universe, but the craziest one has to be when he went through Hell and fashioned armor from his former lover's flesh and yeah it's as awesome as it sounds:\n\nhttp://marvel.com/universe/Doctor_Doom_(Victor_von_Doom)#The_Road_to_Hell\n\n\n\nSo to address your specific question Doom is an amazing character... that has incredibly never been properly adapted from the page. I think this is because he demands a shit ton of context and examination. He's BIG character with a BIG personality who does BIG shit. Squeezing him into a supporting role in a 90 minute popcorn flick is a grave injustice.\n\nThere have been a couple of [cartoons that have been a bit more on the mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi86yeXB9pI), but nothing that captures the gravity of his role in the MU.\n\nAdmittedly though, I'm not as up on Doom and F4 as I probably should be.

In fact that kind of upsets me. It takes the emotional sting out of the end of ROTJ. His profound sadness at seeing Luke suffer finally re-ignited the good him *in that moment*. It's so singular and powerful. His unflinching and ruthless loyalty to the Dark Side is what made that moment so special. To think that he was really a sort of sleeper agent the whole time cheapens things considerably.\n\nAnd I just can't meet you even half way about The Joker. I'm not even that big of a Batman fan, not even close to how much I love SW. But The Joker is *the* comic book villain.\n\nJust look at the iterations of him- Frank Miller's *Dark Knight Returns*, Heath Ledger's *The Dark Knight*, Scott Snyder's *Endgame*, Alan Moore's *The Killing Joke* (NOT the movie version!), and of course Mark Hamil's animated series version. All of them were deliciously evil in their own way, meticulously weaving tapestries of madness, chaos, and whimsy.\n\nI'm sorry.

I do feel they take something away from the gameplay. And the game is too easy, even on hard mode during missions. I can count on two hands how many times I've died total.\n\nIt also feels like there is no reason to visit the Darkzone until level 30 because of how easy it is to level up, and get decent enough gear from doing regular missions. But if you go to the DZ after you reach the end of the game, there isn't much to gain from that either. I can't imagine it taking very long to get the best gear in the game.\n\nThere isn't any real PVP, and the punishment for dying as a rogue isn't worth the risk. Sadly, future projections for DLC indicate that this isn't going to improve much. They're excited to launch a new gamemode at the end of the year that isn't very popular where other games have tried it.\n\nI loved the game during beta, but now I'm left wanting more from the entire experience. I bought the Gold Edition, and I'm not sure I'm going to get 100 hours of entertainment out of this game, unfortunately.", "id": "d0to1gs"}, {"comment": "I'm liking the game so far. I think you have to like 3rd person shooters, though, otherwise you're obviously not going to like it. The developers have been calling it an \"RPG\" but that's not really accurate. It feels like a combination of Destiny, The Last of Us, and Day Z.\n\nDestiny: It has some RPG influences in that you have weapon drops, although the drop rate is a bit higher in The Division making it feel a bit like Borderlands in terms of its loot system. There are also armor drops, weapon mods, etc. The Division also has a semi-open world where you can encounter other players. This happens in both the PvE environment and the PvP environment. It's not a MMO but it's a cool way to meet players and helps the game feel more alive.\n\nThe Last of Us: It's got a 3rd person cover shooting system and takes place in post-apocalyptic environment. No zombies (that I know of) in The Division though. I think the cover system feels great in The Division. Rarely there is a piece of cover that I think I should be able to use and I can't use it, but for the most part my guy goes where I want him to go. The combat isn't as tactical as Rainbow Six but it's got some strategy. Not too much, not too little.\n\nDay Z: In addition to it being post-apocalyptic, The Division has a \"Dark Zone\" which plays out like Day Z Lite. Personally I got too stressed out playing Day Z because I hated losing everything I worked for over something stupid. You can definitely lose gear in The Dark Zone to other players, but you generally just lose some things you recently picked up and did not have a chance to \"extract\" from the DZ. So for me it gives you the fun of teaming up with friends or random people to get into Open World PVP shenanigans with a more long term character investment.\n\nAs far as amount of content goes... Well, obviously it's the first week. All I know is I like the core game and there's plenty to do. However I do have a full time job, gym 4 days a week, and girlfriend. So I'm playing the game pretty casually. If it were back in the day during my college years I'm sure I would wreck all of the content in no time. But for me right now, it's plenty. I'm looking forward to completing the story, getting max level, and going out to the DZ with my friend.\n\nWill I play the Division 6 months from now? Probably not--I don't play any game for that long unless it's something like EverQuest. But I do think I will get $60 worth of the game for damn sure. I don't know why people think every game needs to have a the replayability of several lifetimes.

I guess Vince agrees:\n\n> I always kind of hate to nail it down so explicitly\n\nIt's more like Walt was bad all along.\n\n> most viewers of 'Breaking Bad' assume Gretchen and Elliott are the bad guys, and they assume that Walt got ripped off by them, got ill used by them\n\nI didn't assume that, I just liked the ambiguity that we didn't know. Elliot could totally have stolen Walt's girlfriend, which both created a situation where Walt wanted out and gave him ill will towards his former partners. Or, Walt could have done his usual fuckery that we saw onscreen aplenty, and kicked himself out while blaming the others.\n"], [19, "I have always felt like the truth is somewhere in between it being Walter's \"fault\" and being Elliot's and Gretchen's Family's \"fault\". We know that Walter didn't so much as leave the company as he left his life with Elliot and Gretchen. I make this distinction because he left abruptly at a Fourth of July party at her house rather then at a \"company meeting\" or something. And I think we can infer from his attachment to his meth product as a sense of pride and self worth, he likely would have felt the same way to his research. So I think the issue that led him to leaving was \"domestic\" as the only times he ever honestly thinks of leaving his meth behind and kind of does so for a while is for \"domestic\" reasons.\n\nPersonally I get the sense that Gretchen was from a higher social and economic standing than Walt and/or her family was not welcoming or supportive of Walt. It seems like Gretchen didn't care what her family thought and deeply loved Walt, but these issues were probably too great a wound on Walt's pride and ego. If his intelligence (his primary asset) wasn't good enough for her family, then he likely felt he wasn't good enough for her. Personally I think if he had swallowed his pride then and stayed things would have worked out just fine, but Walt seems more driven by a sense of immediate satisfaction and immediate success rather than building a business meticulously (as we see with the speed at which he rises to the top of the meth business and falls). \n\nAs for Elliot I don't think he actively shut or pushed Walt out of the company, but I don't think he was actively supportive or constructive either. In particular I think the relative absence of Elliot and the stronger presence of Gretchen in the earlier seasons and the later Charlie Rose interview speaks volumes about Walt and Elliot's relationship back in college and what could have transpired over Grey Matter. Basically I think they were the kind of people who were friends only really because they were roommates and not because they truly shared an enduring or deep connection. And I think that this key difference was brought to the surface when they started the company and a rift began to develop. I think that Walt felt like he was (and probably was) the smarter of the two, but I think he did not have an understanding of what it would take to actually run research as a business. So every time Walt and Elliot disagreed he probably felt like Elliot was assaulting his intelligence rather than attempting to make the right decision for the company.\n\nSo while I ultimately feel leaving was Walt's own poor decision and his own mistake and he should bare the ultimate responsibility for his actions, I think it would be disingenuous to say that it was only Walt's ego and pride that caused it, like his breaking bad was inevitable (because I don't think it was). I think there was a culture surrounding him that was not conducive to self-respect and self-growth. I feel that Elliot is wrong to downplay Walt's contributions to the company as I almost certain that Walt didn't just come up with the name for the company otherwise I doubt he would have needed a real buyout back then and I think we know he was doing some kind of research at the time. But neither do I feel like Walt has any right to feel like Grey Matter is his company any more than he should feel like Gretchen should still be his girlfriend. Founding a company does not mean he had any direct role in its current prominence even if the company still used his research.\n\n**tl;dr While Walt's ego and pride may be primarily at fault for his decision to leave and he has little right to blame Gretchen and Elliot for ruining his life, his anger is far from impossible to understand. While Gretchen was obviously supportive and cared for Walt deeply, it is possible that her family and Elliot created a social environment that made it difficult for Walt to grow past his flaws and make healthy decisions.**\n\n*As for my tin foil fan theory that has almost no basis in fact, I think that Walt was going to propose to Gretchen that weekend and asked for her father's permission but he said no. Walt could have easily gone ahead anyway but the fact that her father felt that he wasn't good enough for his daughter broke him.*\n\n*Further I think that Walt probably reached out to Elliot (who he might have been aware at the time also had a torch for Gretchen) for support. But while I think Elliot tried to be supportive his own budding love for Gretchen probably led to a kind of subconscious sabotage on both their parts. And regardless of whether or not Elliot was truly sad that Gretchen and Walt broke up, the fact that he eventually married her would likely hurt Walt regardless.*"], [16, "I always thought he left to settle down and marry Skylar, which made him all the more irrational for taking anger out on the other co-founders. He got bought out reasonably at the time, but subsequently became jealous when the company grew and grew. Walt's entire story revolves around the audience staying on his side as he, mostly irrationally, takes his anger out on others for his decisions. He could have had free treatment, he didn't take it. He could have stopped cooking, he didn't. He could have stayed safe with Gus, he didn't want to. Through all of this, though, the audience stays on Walt's side."], [8, "Walter White? Losing it?

Utterly nonsensical for where Walter White was at that stage of his career, brilliant and on the cusp of something amazing. It completely destroys the suspension of disbelief because it is so completely out of character. Walt felt he was destined for great things as evidenced by the flashback to when he and Gretchen were together. He simply didn't feel inferior, as exemplified by Heisenberg - inferior? Pah!\n\nThis has really diminished the entire story. A far more convincing scenario would have been that Walt focused too much on work and so Eliot and Gretchen ended up drifting together and this is why Walt left. Thanks God they cut this from the show, it would have moved it from one of the best ever made to something akin to Damages."], [1, "I always kind of figured it was his pride. It is his worst quality and pretty much is the reason he is who he is."], [1, "I thought it was for personal reasons(Gretchen chose Elliot over Walt or something like that) and Walt didn't know that the company would become so successful. When it did, he regretted it and tried to tell himself that it was because of them and them alone.\n\nAs for \"feeling inferior\", well, that's unfortunate and that can lead to a lot of bad behavior, but I can't help but think that Walt would have NO regrets if Grey Matter didn't end up so successful. He would have been happy to have left. \n\nAnyway, Gretchen and Elliot can't be blamed for Walt's issue. That was HIS problem and while he had every right to leave, blaming them was just wrong.

No, Walt doesn't say EXACTLY what happened all those years ago, but we have MOST of the information.  I will never understand why there is such a mystery to the Grey Matter situation because it was always pretty straight-forward to me.  Walt broke up with his college girlfriend (why? who cares. does not matter.) He had already started a company with her and a third partner and he didn't want to continue working with his ex so he took a (cheap) buyout. Now its all these years later and his two former partners (one of whom is his ex) are rich off of the company that they all started and are happy together without Walt.

Early in the series it seemed like he's gotten snubbed, but by the time he game his \"empire\" speech it just seemed completely clear that he has screwed up but was too prideful to admit it was his fault, so he convinced himself that Gretchen and Elliot were the ones to blame and he deserved the same riches they had.", "id": "d13noha"}, {"comment": "I remember Walt tells Jessie how he left because he felt things were going to end badly between the partners due to a disagreement and how by doing that, he basically fucked himself from being in something big.

It adds to it", "id": "d13nodl"}], [{"comment": "I have always felt like the truth is somewhere in between it being Walter's \"fault\" and being Elliot's and Gretchen's Family's \"fault\". We know that Walter didn't so much as leave the company as he left his life with Elliot and Gretchen. I make this distinction because he left abruptly at a Fourth of July party at her house rather then at a \"company meeting\" or something. And I think we can infer from his attachment to his meth product as a sense of pride and self worth, he likely would have felt the same way to his research. So I think the issue that led him to leaving was \"domestic\" as the only times he ever honestly thinks of leaving his meth behind and kind of does so for a while is for \"domestic\" reasons.\n\nPersonally I get the sense that Gretchen was from a higher social and economic standing than Walt and/or her family was not welcoming or supportive of Walt. It seems like Gretchen didn't care what her family thought and deeply loved Walt, but these issues were probably too great a wound on Walt's pride and ego. If his intelligence (his primary asset) wasn't good enough for her family, then he likely felt he wasn't good enough for her. Personally I think if he had swallowed his pride then and stayed things would have worked out just fine, but Walt seems more driven by a sense of immediate satisfaction and immediate success rather than building a business meticulously (as we see with the speed at which he rises to the top of the meth business and falls). \n\nAs for Elliot I don't think he actively shut or pushed Walt out of the company, but I don't think he was actively supportive or constructive either. In particular I think the relative absence of Elliot and the stronger presence of Gretchen in the earlier seasons and the later Charlie Rose interview speaks volumes about Walt and Elliot's relationship back in college and what could have transpired over Grey Matter. Basically I think they were the kind of people who were friends only really because they were roommates and not because they truly shared an enduring or deep connection. And I think that this key difference was brought to the surface when they started the company and a rift began to develop. I think that Walt felt like he was (and probably was) the smarter of the two, but I think he did not have an understanding of what it would take to actually run research as a business. So every time Walt and Elliot disagreed he probably felt like Elliot was assaulting his intelligence rather than attempting to make the right decision for the company.\n\nSo while I ultimately feel leaving was Walt's own poor decision and his own mistake and he should bare the ultimate responsibility for his actions, I think it would be disingenuous to say that it was only Walt's ego and pride that caused it, like his breaking bad was inevitable (because I don't think it was). I think there was a culture surrounding him that was not conducive to self-respect and self-growth. I feel that Elliot is wrong to downplay Walt's contributions to the company as I almost certain that Walt didn't just come up with the name for the company otherwise I doubt he would have needed a real buyout back then and I think we know he was doing some kind of research at the time. But neither do I feel like Walt has any right to feel like Grey Matter is his company any more than he should feel like Gretchen should still be his girlfriend. Founding a company does not mean he had any direct role in its current prominence even if the company still used his research.\n\n**tl;dr While Walt's ego and pride may be primarily at fault for his decision to leave and he has little right to blame Gretchen and Elliot for ruining his life, his anger is far from impossible to understand. While Gretchen was obviously supportive and cared for Walt deeply, it is possible that her family and Elliot created a social environment that made it difficult for Walt to grow past his flaws and make healthy decisions.**\n\n*As for my tin foil fan theory that has almost no basis in fact, I think that Walt was going to propose to Gretchen that weekend and asked for her father's permission but he said no. Walt could have easily gone ahead anyway but the fact that her father felt that he wasn't good enough for his daughter broke him.*\n\n*Further I think that Walt probably reached out to Elliot (who he might have been aware at the time also had a torch for Gretchen) for support. But while I think Elliot tried to be supportive his own budding love for Gretchen probably led to a kind of subconscious sabotage on both their parts. And regardless of whether or not Elliot was truly sad that Gretchen and Walt broke up, the fact that he eventually married her would likely hurt Walt regardless.*", "id": "d13k4vh"}], [{"comment": "I always thought he left to settle down and marry Skylar, which made him all the more irrational for taking anger out on the other co-founders.
