", "id": "d6zs3ko"}, {"comment": "I've gone to college for Graphic Design for two years and dealt a lot with Photoshop and Illustrator, with Illustrator being vector based. So while I'm *not really* a professional, hopefully I can give you a decent summary without murdering it.\n\nAs it was explained to me, a vector is something of a mathematic equation. Apply this to illustration. Normally illustrations are created and saved pixel based. When editing them, if you zoom into the image, the quality becomes pixelated. They're pixel based, as opposed to being based on equations.\n\nWhen editing a vectored illustration, there is no pixelated mess. You can scale the image up 100x its original size, or you can shrink it down to less than 1/100th, and the quality of the illustration will remain the same. Why? Because it's vectored, and those lines and curves, or lack of, are all equations.\n\nSo that tree silhouette in this outline is likely a vector. It could be twice as big or super small, but it's quality wouldn't change. However, while the tree *could* be a vector, the wallpaper itself is jpg and scaled it up would make it blurry. \n\n", "id": "d6zsssb"}, {"comment": "That's interesting, I wonder why it hasn't been applied to cgi or game graphics. Perhaps too resource intensive? ", "id": "d6zuhvu"}, {"comment": "I could be mistaken, but from what I've learned, vectors are usually best as 2D illustrations, or illustrations 'simulating' 3D. I suppose things like the [Coca-Cola](https://www.seeklogo.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/coca-cola-logo-400x400.png) logo (or most logos, really), or this illustration of [Gordan Ramsey](http://mustified.com/wp-content/themes/Mustified/images/post_images/Amazing-Artistic-Vector-Portraits-01.jpg).\n\nHowever, I have no doubt vectors are used in games. Things like icons, text and even effects could be vectors. For example, in some games, a character would get hit and see stars circling their head, right? Those stars could very well be vectors.\n\nAnother example could be a game like the old 2D Super Mario games. Being 2D and simplistic, it would be very easy to make a game like that entirely out of vectors, and maybe it was. Though you wouldn't really know. Vectors are great for scaling things up and down without losing quality, but at the same time if you create your game assets the appropriate size you knowing you won't need to resize them, a vector *isn't necessarily* required.\n\nHowever, as I see it I'm fairly certain the use of vectors is generally viewed as professional, as it gives you a clean illustration to use regardless of where it's needed. Do you want a logo for a website? For a letterhead, or for a giant banner? Instead of creating three separately sized versions of the *same* logo, you can just create the logo through vectors and then it can be scaled up or down as needed.\n\n Relevant to what I just mentioned, the first logo I was hired to make *wasn't* vector based, and it's my permanent embarrassment. Poor quality in general as I was still a student, but aside from that I had only made it one size, creating unnecessary issues that could have been avoided had I simply vectored the logo. \n\nIn any case, vectors are pretty big in the world of design and editing.\n\n", "id": "d6zvaei"}, {"comment": "Learned something today.

It's this reason that most shields used in combat were actually smaller and made of lighter materials such boiled leather or wood.\n\nPeople usually underestimate how tiresome a shield is on the user... Imagine strapping a 5-10lbs dumbbell to your arm and waving around at arm's length for hours at a time and you start to get an idea of how much strain a shield puts on your arm and shoulder muscles in the field.\n\nWhen fighting with a large shield like this you kept it close to your body and you'd duck behind it or change your position relative to your opponent's rather than bring it to your front in defense since the time it would take you to lift it is slower than your opponent can swing.

Because I feel like as you walk down those stairs at any time would be spooky...\n\nLike what if the birds stopped chirping while you are walking in the woods on a nice day. The eerie silence is deafening as you stop to pause and look around inquisitively. A small sound catches your ears...is that a branch shifting? Maybe leaves? A squirrel walking abou---! Suddenly a distinct snap of a branch near to your left within the woods.\n\nYou turn to find what is making that sound as the wind slowly picks up and the leaves are kicked up around you...and see nothing. Absolutely nothing. Slightly annoyed and perturbed you take a quick look around and then continue down the stairs. But your eyes keep darting to the left towards the woods. Something is there...but you can't tell what it is.\n\nThe wind dies down and the leaves stop shuffling. Still the birds haven't picked up their summer singing. You look up at the blue sky absently to keep yourself from letting your childish fears take over you. Fears built upon the stories told late in the night in jest by doting parents and campfire friends. You've outgrown those long ago. Though the Sun is out the air is colder for some reason and you feel an unnatural chill run up your spine and as glance to your left once more.\n\nA hunched shape, bent at an odd angle is peeking slightly from behind a tree. It's far away - about 30 meters or so - yet it is distinctly humanoid in shape. You can't tell how tall it is, but several things strike at you immediately: the hands and fingers wrapped around the large trunk of a tree are too long, skinny, and the bones in them are gnarled and look to be broken in several places. The oily black skin undulates and shifts as if something...or many things...are moving under it. And the skin keeps changing texture and colour as if like a chameleon or an octopus was trying to blend in and disappear into it's surroundings and failing.\n\nIt's torso is mind-boggling skinny and it's ribs are prominently visible...and too many of them for a normal person...the body is twisted in a misaligned \"S\" shape - as if a child learning to draw the letter S had created it. But most terrifying of all is the face peeking out at you: a glistening wet bright red face. No. Not a red face...a skinless face with the hollowed black portion where nose should have been! \n\n*OH GOD HELP ME IT'S EYES!* \n\nAnd it's eyes...the white of it's eyes are huge taking up most of the upper portion of the face and the black inky coloured pupils are pulsing from small to big rapidly. Terror grips you. A most primal fear takes over you and your entire body as the figure leans a bit more out from behind the tree and it's yellow glistening teeth not covered by any hint of lips begins to chatter against one another.\n\n*CHKKKKT. CHKKKT. CHKKKKT.*\n\nIt's head begins shaking from the chattering of the teeth and starts to jerk from left to right quickly. All the while the eyes pulsing are transfixed upon yours and begin matching and mimicking the quickening beat of your heart slamming against your rib-cage.\n\n*BA-DUMP. BA-DUMP. BA-DUMP*\n\nYou try to force yourself to look away and to run, but your body and mind are gripped by this...thing...has frozen all of your senses. But in your head the lizard portion of your brain is screaming, thrashing around, and shouting at you to move! Flee! *RUN!* As if your entire body were in a pool of ice water your body slowly begins to move and your command over it is finally realized and acknowledged. You make a slight almost imperceptible move to your right with your feet which causes the creature to stop it's head from flitting about. It's head once more faces towards you...like a lion sizing up it's prey the creature moves ever so quietly and gently forwards on all fours. The leaves barely move or make sound as it begins to slowly stalk towards you. You feel the sudden demand and need from your survival instinct kicking in...the need to run. \n\n*Come on run. WHY AREN'T YOU MOVING?! Run! RUN!*\n\nThe voice in your head finally loudly screams at you: \n\n#**\"RUN!\"**\n\nYou turn quickly and instantly let your legs take over as behind you a shriek - as if a person were being skinned alive - pierces the air and the crashing of leaves and branches follows suit. The chattering teeth are so loud.\n\n*OH GOD RUN!* \n\nTears are stinging at your eyes blurring your vision as the chattering grows louder and closer. It's hissing breath is so loud! You let out a scream that had been building into a knot in your stomach and you lurch forward even faster towards the house. All your senses are numbed. Your limbs are on autopilot and moving in their own free will. All that matters is the front door ahead of you!\n\n*COME ON KEEP RUNNING YOU ARE ALMOST THERE!!*\n\nYou don't dare to turn around as you near the house and hear the thumping limbs behind you are closer than ever. The sound of it's flesh and broken bones slamming on the grass and stone steps sounds like wet meat being repeatedly smashed with a hammer is nauseating to you. Jamming your hands into your pockets you find your keys. \n\n*JESUS, ALLAH, BUDDHA PLEASE PLEASE DON'T MISS THE KEY-HOLE!* \n\nKeys pointed forward like a knife you turn to look behind you and see the creature splayed like a spider in hot pursuit just steps away from you...it's eyes have stopped pulsing and are entirely filled in with a black colour...so dark...lifeless and soulless. Shrieking in fear you throw yourself at the front door jamming the keys in successfully. You swing open the door, slam, and lock it in one swift movement. You press your back against the door bracing it for sudden impact.\n\n...\n\nNo slamming of flesh against the door. From beyond the threshold you hear nothing. No howling or scratching. No blood curdling scream. Your heart is the first sound you hear in your ears - a loud thumping sound of blood rushing through your veins:\n\n*BA-DUMP. BA-DUMP. BA-DUMP.*\n\nYour breath is haggard and painful as your lungs are sucking in and expelling air rapidly. You let out a silent wracked sob and your tears start to fall upon your cheeks as the adrenaline and shock hits you...did you really see what you did? Did you really have some unholy thing in the woods chase you? Maybe you were hallucinating? Was this a panic attack? You slide down to the floor as your legs give way and you wrap your arms around your legs. You look up and see the family dog cowering in the dark of the hallway not making a sound and looking at you...no...beyond you with it's eyes wide open and ears pulled back.\n\n*CHKKKT. CHKKKT. CHKKKT.*\n\nYou place both of your hands across your mouth to keep yourself from screaming aloud. Through the flimsy wooden door right where your head is resting...mere centimeters of wood separating you from...*IT*...you hear teeth chattering against one another softly and slowly...as the door handle begins to move and turn ever so gently. You turn to see where the mail slot is in the door to see the white eyes and their black pupils locked on to your own eyes...pulsing in time with your heart beat as long gnarled fingers snake their way towards the lock of the door twisting it silently open.\n\n#*BA-DUMP!

However, their presence is not especially damaging or harmful to the whales either. Because of the size and strength of whales, they are able to navigate the ocean waters with little impediment from the added weight and resistance. In some cases, whales can even use a heavy layer of barnacles as a plate of armor against attacks from other whales.\nBarnacles, on the other hand, gain a tremendous advantage from their partnership with whales. By attaching themselves to the belly, back and sides of whales, they enable themselves to hitch a free ride through nutrient-rich water environments. This allows barnacles to consume micro-organisms that float freely in the water, which would otherwise be inaccessible to the barnacles.\nBarnacles begin their lives as free-floating larvae, and they transform into fully developed barnacles only after they have implanted onto a host (the skin of a whale). This symbiotic relationship has helped barnacles continue to survive and thrive as one of the Earth's oldest living animals.", "id": "d3erfml"}, {"comment": "Lmao.

It was heartbreaking.  It took John some time to grieve, so for a while he would babysit others' dogs and other animals, until he felt ready to find a new best friend. But eventually he did.  And his name is Bear.\n\nYou can follow their adventures on FB.

", "id": "d7xnwz2"}, {"comment": "This image, while rendered, is mostly accurate to some of the things we have seen though we've never been so lucky as to actually see the event horizon, mainly because the event horizons of black holes are insanely small in comparison to the mass of these objects. \n\nNow, to give that statement some perspective. The sun has a radius   of approximately 696,300 km (432,288 mi) and a mass of approximately 1.989 * 10^30 kg. Yeah.. that's around 1,989,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg. It is an absolutely massive object. The earth, in relation, has a radius of about 6,371 km (3,959 mi) and a mass of around 5.972 * 10^24 kg. The sun is literally over 100 times wider than the earth and 100,000 times more massive. If you were to make a black hole out of the sun, it's mass would stay virtually the same, but now it has a radius of only 3 km (1.9 mi).\n\nAnything outside of the sun's old radius of nearly 696,300 km wouldn't notice much of a difference other than the lack of light coming from what used to be the sun. Their orbits wouldn't change and they'd continue doing mostly what they're doing now. The real change is when you go beyond that original radius and closer to the sun's new 3 km wide event horizon. All of a sudden.. you can get much much closer to a very concentrated version of that massive object. Apparent gravity changes a lot because the gravity of an object is always strongest at it's surface.\n\nThink about earth again. At it's surface, the gravity you experience is about 1G. When you go below the surface, the deeper you go, the less gravity you experience. This isn't, of course, because the earth got smaller, but moreover because the gravity isn't pulling from just below you anymore. Instead, the mass of the earth is now all around you. That means that if you could, somehow, get to the exact center of gravity for the planet, you should experience 0G since the mass will be evenly distributed around you.\n\nNow, going back to our terrifying solar black hole. You can get much much closer to the center of gravity and still have all that mass concentrated below you than you used to. Instead of getting to damn near 696,300 km and then having gravity start to reduce, you can go all the way to 3 km and it's still going. It gets to a point, well outside the event horizon of the black hole, where the acceleration due to gravity is many orders of magnitude stronger at your feet than at your head. At that point you are quite literally torn apart as minuscule distances equate to several hundreds to potentially thousands of times more gravitational pull. The effect of which is actually called spagettification as you are pulled into an insanely hot and thin stream of plasma.\n\nThe event horizon is the place where the escape velocity required to leave the black hole's gravitational influence is greater than the speed of light. Therefore, anything that goes beyond the event horizon can never really get out. However, it was well beyond this point that the in-falling object was torn apart at the atomic level and converted into a stream of insanely hot plasma. That plasma gives off quite a lot of light and, since the light is emitted well outside of the black hole's event horizon, it can still very much escape.\n\nGenerally, what we find is that in-falling matter tends to clump together in a disc around the black hole. This matter is torn into it's constituent parts, heats up drastically, and, due to the insane effects of physics outside a black hole (it would take a long time to explain here), often forms two jets of plasma that shoot off the poles of the black hole at some significant fraction of the speed of light. All, again, well outside of the event horizon, so light is not entirely in danger of falling in.\n\nAs to your question, all light is capable of escaping from a black hole, as long as it doesn't go beyond the event horizon, but we can't always see it. Gas clouds and the interstellar medium can block visible light. Infrared is one of the ways that we can kind of view stuff we normally wouldn't be able to see otherwise. Looking in the infrared is how we're able to see past some of the huge amounts of matter between us as and the center of our galaxy, for example.\n\nTL;DR: This picture is an artistic render of a much less visually appealing but very real picture. Black holes are crazy tiny and shit gets torn apart well outside the event horizon. Light emitted from the hot plasma shit falling towards the black hole and being shot out like a plasma beam from the poles, but not yet inside the black hole, can still escape; which is what we'd be seeing. The reason, I suspect, for only being able to see it in infrared is because there are shitloads of gas, dust, and shit between us and the black hole and that is a problem we have to contend with often, especially when viewing past the galactic disc.\n\nTL:DRTLDR: The light didn't go past the black part.

However, astronomical objects like planets and stars are considerably denser at their cores. Because of the weight of the outer layers is compressing the core.\n\nIn fact the pull of Earth's gravity *increases* as you deeper, Up until a little over 2,000km below the surface. At which point it does start to decrease.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth", "id": "d7z5o4a"}, {"comment": "I made my post under the assumption that people had no prior knowledge except maybe some basic high school physical science. Explaining that would require explaining how the planet is layered. After that, I'd have to explain at least some of the math behind gravity, like the inverse square law. Then I'd have to use all of that new information to explain how gravity can increase then decrease while still conveying the primary point about how proximity to center of gravity works.. or more to the point.. how two objects with the same mass could possibly be so different. I need to convey all that without giving anyone the impression that black holes suck things in like a vacuum. What you're describing is not exactly intuitive with that goal in mind. \n\nIt's one of those things that can, to people hearing about it for the first time, seem like a paradox and could absolutely have taken away from explaining the concept of surface gravity and how it relates to black holes. It's why I left out the description behind how the relativistic jets work. It's why I state you could float in the center of the earth if you could get there, when in reality the mass isn't evenly distributed enough to succeed at it. It's why I kind of assume a non-rotating black hole, totally ignore the magnetic effects of black holes, ignore the relativistic effects of being so close to a black hole, and don't mention that technically stuff isn't lost forever to a black hole because they do evaporate due to hawking radiation... which explaining that gets into explaining virtual particles and.. why they're \"real\" but not real.. It's a mess. The in depth stuff kind of stuff can be taught later.\n\nIt's more important to get the core concepts across rather than be as accurate to reality as possible. It's one thing when we're talking among others who have a physics background, but it's entirely different when you're trying to get someone into astronomy or physics in the first place. It's also why I left out all of the math and formulation beyond the stuff related to scale. In general, I don't think we do a great job of explaining physics to people. We make it way more daunting than it really is by throwing way too much hard to grasp stuff at people. Math, for example, is just not something our brains are good at in any way. Calculating numbers is just not something intuitive to the way the brain works and a lot of people are scared off math heavy topics simply because we even teach math backwards. \n\nI have found that starting with the interesting concepts and building it up from that before introducing the math and really abstract stuff helps a lot. It's the difference between all the complicated stuff being an overwhelming distraction that dissuades people from getting into it and having all the complicated stuff just make the image of everything they already know make even more sense. When you introduce the math last, for example, most people will have these amazing eureka moments as it all just clicks..\n\nYou're not wrong though, not at all. I could have maybe added \"If we assume the earth and sub are a constant density\" before continuing, but even that I kind of felt might have added more questions or confusion than necessary to explain the main points.", "id": "d7zbwmu"}, {"comment": "That's an excellent view on teaching complex topics. ", "id": "d7zfoux"}, {"comment": "I've spent a lot of time tutoring people and getting to work with people in such an individual capacity has given me a few insights in how people learn. Often people would wind up coming to me when they've already started having problems with a subject. I've found that, more often than not, people are most certainly capable of understanding just about anything, it's just that the methods schools use to mass produce education are not in any way intuitive. Knowledge winds up being presented in a really roundabout way that doesn't really explain anything. It's a bunch of shortcuts people memorize to do tasks but without actually understanding what they're doing or what's actually happening. It produces people whose educations include a lot of gaps that can very easily get filled with nonsense or misdirected ideas.\n\nI find the way to totally change a students entire outlook is to just make it relatable and more importantly to explain the missing why. You find a way to take out all the unexplained shortcuts and overcomplicated duct taped together bullshit memorization and just explain why something is the way it is. Often, if you can make the concept itself relatable then the shortcuts and complex ideas that follow just come naturally. When you can get it to work it's an amazing thing to watch as a person just lights up with realization and kind of sometimes starts to discover for themselves what comes next. That's when you know you've succeeded.\n\nI kind of stumbled upon teaching that way accidentally. I'm an autodidact, so I wind up teaching myself a lot of subjects with basically little to no outside help beyond academic sources. I'm also absolutely terrible at calculating or even thinking about math unless I know exactly what I'm doing. It got to the point where I literally just couldn't follow what was happening in my math classes. I thought I was really bad at math until I kind of stumbled across a thing that showed what was actually happening in some of the algebra I was doing. Bam.. it all clicked immediately and all the shortcuts made sense. All because I got to see how two seemingly unrelated ideas.. well.. related.\n\nWorks for a lot of stuff. Analogies and explaining complex scientific principles as simply as possible while giving as clear an image as possible. Avoid formulas and math until after they can visualize or grasp the underlying concepts in some simple way. Then introduce the more complex ideas and the stuff that sets it apart from those analogies. If you do it right, honestly, knowledge just kind of leads to more knowledge as you just naturally start to conjecture about the implications of what you just learned and, with a little guidance, basically kind of rediscover the more complex ideas in basically the order humans discovered them in the first place.\n\nAll this might be a little vague. I'll try and explain how I see the world and specifically.. knowledge. The way I look at it, all knowledge is interconnected in a web where the intersections represent individual ideas whether they be facts or conjecture. We build our understanding of reality by interconnecting related ideas together until the chains between one subject (like biology) connect directly to the chains of another (like chemistry). I have yet to find a single truth in this universe that does not connect cleanly to the the rest of the truths in some way. A actual fact might not connect to the other facts directly, it might even take quite a few steps, but it almost certainly connects directly to a fact that connects to some other fact.\n\nWhere I think education goes wrong is that it tries to connect parts of the \"knowledge web\" that are so distant that you can't immediately see how they chain together. Unfortunately, because people are naturally inquisitive, the consequence of that sometimes is that they'll connect ideas together that shouldn't be connected or connect in a different way based solely on those two distantly connected facts. In essence, the bits in between those distant ideas get filled with interconnected points of conjecture instead points of fact. The problem with that is that points of conjecture are easy to change when they make up the very edges of what you know, but very difficult to let go of when they make up the foundations of what you think you know. \n\nIf instead we worked to teach why seemingly unrelated ideas connect and at least touch on the ideas inbetween that make up the real chains of knowledge connecting them together into some understandable truth, then we'll have much better foundations from which to learn and integrate new information in the future. Ofttimes it takes just one small correction to completely change everything about what a person knows. If you can catch that while someone is still learning, it's easy. The fringes of human knowledge, where conjecture tests itself against perception and reality where only the best ideas become personally held truth, is readily open to change. Later.. if some earlier bit of conjecture or misinformation has become lodged in the deepest recesses of your knowledge web, the foundations of your internal model of reality and truth, well.. deconstructing that is often all but impossible, especially true if the person is unwilling to change. One such person can be found continually responding with nonsense to my original post on black holes. His \"web of knowledge\" is built on so much conjecture and misunderstood ideas so sparsely connected with actual fact that, while he thinks he is as correct as anyone else, he knows so little and assumes so very much that it actually pains me a little to see it.\n\n*As an aside, I personally believe that cognitive dissonance is important and is basically your mind telling you you've got two personally held truths and, given some new bit of information, they are not both capable of being true. Every time that happens it is an opportunity to grow and change for the better at the cost of some discomfort and emotional pain. I've found that usually the pain is temporary and what you gain is permanent.*\n\nTL;DR: I write way too god damned much..", "id": "d7zmrk1"}, {"comment": "Please tutor as many people as possible.

I'll clarify further if it any of this doesn't make much sense. I'm going to make a few assumptions I normally wouldn't to save time.\n\nWe don't actually know where the mass goes. Our understanding of physics breaks down beyond the event horizon. This doesn't mean that what we do know is wrong or anything like that, but it does mean we've got more to learn to make sense of it. There must be something happening that we don't understand fully or that we're missing. There are some ideas, but nothing conclusive yet.\n\nWe do know this though.. black holes are really weird. Normal objects will, as they grow in mass, have a change in volume and possibly density that will affect the radius of the object. Mindbogglingly large increases to an objects mass will then only equate to very small changes in radius of an object. Black holes don't work like that.\n\nNo, they don't work like that at all.. The event horizon increases in a much more direct relationship between mass and it's size. Basically, instead of the relationship between radius and mass generally being a function of volume and density and therefore related to cubed and cubed roots of the radius. The relationship between the event horizon's mass and radius is direct. Namely.. that a change to mass directly increases the radius of the event horizon.\n\nAny increase in the black hole's mass, from.. for example, another star coming close enough to be ripped apart by gravity and sent careening past the black hole's event horizon will add mass to the black hole. That increased mass will directly and linearly affect the radius of the black hole's event horizon. A doubling of the mass will double the radius of the event horizon.", "id": "d8fu2ss"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the response!

That just comes down to pure polygons, and how the model is rigged and what kind of equations it's using to bind and weight the skin to the skeleton.\n\nObviously it looks great when it's done right, but part of my mind keeps saying, \"This is just another way of recording actors.\" There are animation engines out there that can imitate a lot of human kinematics so the model can walk, jump, stumble, etc. But they're not up to the fidelity of motion capturing a skilled actor, and fall into the uncanny valley outside of a fairly narrow range of applications.", "id": "czzqj3w"}], [{"comment": "What do i actually need to max this game out on 1440p?", "id": "czzkpsz"}, {"comment": "The graphics cards coming out this summer.

It looks *exactly like* Coruscant, and Coruscant is literally the *only* city planet to be shown in the previous *six* Star Wars films. In the three prequels, Coruscant is the *main* location for the stories. The name of the planet is not spoken in the movie, but it's referred to as \"the Republic\" or \"the government of the Republic,\" which, last we heard, *was* Coruscant.\n\nI'd wager that, in the minds of the majority of people who've seen the movie, that *was* Coruscant. And so, whether they meant to or not, they destroyed Coruscant.", "id": "dasm078"}, {"comment": "Yep I thought that was Coruscant.

So far Coruscant has pretty much been ignored in the new canon, and it may be that Disney doesn't plan on using Coruscant too much, and thus they are leaving it for side stories only.  \n\n\nPretty much all of TFA was hearkening back to A New Hope, and it was an attempt to overwrite the prequels. In A New Hope when Alderaan got shot we knew nothing about it. In TFA The Hosnian system is shot, and we know literally nothing about it besides \"Republic\" stuff. Is this bad storytelling? Yeah? Then again no spends much time grieving for the billions of people that just died.

Yeah?\n\nIt comes off as disjointed and a little unceremonious to destroy Coruscant that way, especially focusing in on the faces of characters we have never seen, yeah. Not *good* storytelling; It's not good.\n\n> It is confusing when we use our prior knowledge and expectations, but they never implied or stated that it was the Coruscant.\n\nIt's *heavily* implied, and expecting the audience not to bring prior knowledge to the *seventh installment* of a series is just silly nonsense. The *whole film* is constructed for, and playing to, the audience's prior knowledge.\n\nIf they weren't going to tell us anything about the planet, they should have at least made it not look exactly like a planet that we already all knew about. If \"the Hosnian system\" had a bunch of trees everywhere, and Ewoks running around, or even just a bunch of tree huts that looked like the Ewok village, people would think that it was Endor's forrest moon. If there were a bunch of exactly-like-Naboo buildings everywhere, and shiny spaceships flying around, people would think it was Naboo. \"Oh, that wasn't Naboo. It was this other planet that we've never told you anything about or even loosely implied the existence of, and it just happens to look *exactly* like Naboo.\" It just doesn't fly.\n\nWhether they intended to or not, *for their audience*, they portrayed the destruction of Coruscant. I think that they didn't realize what they'd done until it was too late; Scenes they cut which would have clarified things were out, and now they were showing Coruscant's destruction instead of Hosnia/whatever.

He made himself later on in life. He escaped his (overcrowded) home without a penny to his name when he was very young. He then impressed people with his writing skills and lived off of that. All his life he has been a fan of living with very little and doing sacrifices. He was not totally in favor of slavery but back then was almost a crime to say something against it. Just as culture demanded he had a couple of slaves in his house too, although they were treated like family.\nAs for the Native Americans, remember that they were indeed angry with white people and often killed them very savagely. (the whole deal from the first explorers to Ben Franklin years, lasted a couple of centuries, and they were full of blood from both parts)   \nThey were also used instrumentally (by the dear loving Mom Britain) against some colonies that were promoting US independence. Britain gave them rifles and rum and made few tribes attack US colonies too, to teach them a lesson against revolts. Deteriorating even more how the colonies viewed Natives back then. Few people dear to Franklin were also killed by Natives during some of these attacks, where Benjamin Franklin himself was crowd-promoted to defending the settlement. (he was very popular)\n\nAlthough all of this definitely cannot change the feeling behind your quote, I just hope to have given a bit more details to it. I know that what early settlers/explorers did to the Natives was terrible. But such was life 500+ years ago, and things are much different now.\n\n\nPS: I'm not even American (I'm from Europe). But I read a biography some time ago and was fascinated with the character of Benjamin Franklin. Although not perfect he has been a very interesting figure historically, also crucial to the US independence.", "id": "d9u6i1c"}]]], "4d9lsi": ["The Revenant", "2016-04-04 08:42:59", 2861, "http://i.imgur.com/jielSx8.png", [[23, "I really like this wallpaper, but it has a lot of artifacts if you look at it from an angle"], [22, "Perfect film, amazing wallpaper."], [12, "The original artwork created by [Levente Szab\u00f3](https://www.behance.net/briskartist), who created [posters for BAFTA award](https://www.behance.net/gallery/33674846/BAFTA-2016-Best-Film-posters)s."], [4, "Credit: [Levente Szab\u00f3](https://www.behance.net/briskartist)"], [3, "This would be an amazing mobile wallpaper!"], [3, "This wallpaper made me realize how dirty my monitor is.

I based my rendition of the First Order Stormtrooper helmet on the first teaser trailer, which had limited perspective and didn't reveal that there was a vent on the left.\n\nI'm probably going to redo this project soon with tweaked designs and a better background - /u/panderingwhore did a okay job changing it, even if he didn't ask my permission.

If it is the latter than a half sarcastic comment would mean that it is not, because 1/2X =/= X no matter how you slice it. \n\nThe concept of identity, which states that the idea of B or -B is all encompassing is one of the founding concepts of logic and philosophy.

I am glad to find a person like you with whom I can have a meaningful conversation.\n\nI see that you applied the law of excluded middle in your argument. I would fain accept your exposition if only we were talking about the concept of sarcasm as a stand-alone entity, with an identity of its own. But consider this: Would you not say that \"sarcasm\" is a property of the statement's causing agent (that is, the speaker) rather than a property of the statement itself? In which case, we say about a statement that it's sarcastic only inasmuch as its originating cause (the speaker) created it (uttered it) with the intention of sarcasm. And so two statements, otherwise identical, could nonetheless be different in this property depending on the intention with which they were uttered: \"Yeah, right..\" could be sarcastic or not, depending on the intention of the speaker. And so, if we agree on this, \"sarcasm\", as a property, is shifted from the statement to the speaker, and we only say that a statement is sarcastic (or not) by extension, while the true way of putting it would be to say, that the speaker is sarcastic (or not).\n\nAnd if sarcasm is a property of the human mind, then it could be argued that it doesn't follow a strict dichotomy or mutual exclusivity between being there or not; but rather a fuzzy cloud of probability. A person can say the statement seriously, but on a deeper level of consciousness he is making it as a sarcastic statement. I am not saying that this is the case; but rather, that since we don't really know exactly how we form statements and decide to utter them, it is at least *possible* that this is the case (Dennett's hypothesis of \"language daemons\" is very interesting, albeit based on no empirical evidence. See *Consciousness Explained*) Would you say that this is indeed possible?\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nAlso, /u/koalificated you might be interested as well in our continuous conversation :)", "id": "d7m56eo"}, {"comment": "I feel that while the intent of the speaker causes sarcasm it is not fair to remove it as a property of the sentence. Using the previous example of 'wetness', the wetness in question is a property of water, but we can still freely apply it to something which the water has covered or been absorbed by. \n\nSimilarly, it seems reasonable that when a person imbues a statement with sarcasm the statement then *becomes* sarcastic by that person's intent, rather than the person themselves being sarcastic. After all, it is important the recognize the difference of what it means to call a person sarcastic and a statement sarcastic. If someone were to tell you that \"Dave is sarcastic\" you would reasonably assume that they mean he uses sarcasm often, not that he is actively using sarcasm this very minute. If someone told you that what Dave had said was sarcastic, or that right now he was being sarcastic, you do not change the identity of Dave in your mind. Dave while making a sarcastic comment and Dave while being genuine are the same. It is his statements which are different. \n\nJust because sarcasm does not originate from the sentence does not mean it isn't a property of the sentence. \n\nI also think that if you want to define it as a property of the speaker then it is unfair to classify it as a \"fuzzy cloud\" of probability based on our lack of understanding of consciousness and how it relates to forming sentences. The Law of Excluded Middle is not considered at this time to have any known exceptions, and Occam's Razor would suggest it's more reasonable to assume that consciousness, as everything else we have applied logical laws to thus far, followed the law as well. \n\nSo even if it were a property of the speaker we would still have to identify if at that time the speaker was or was not being sarcastic, in a similar manner to that which I previously mentioned.
