But Pete Ricketts is a fucking asshole who wasted millions in taxpayer money to fund garbage. \n\nI'm not just some guy who doesn't like Republicans, I'm a former Nebraskan who's watching the state's budget implode due to serious mismanagement of money. Ricketts told poor and middle-class Nebraskans to elect him so he could protect their best interests and be frugal with the state's money. \n\nAs it turns out, he's been extremely careless with the state's finances (you know, like someone who's never actually had to worry about money), and based on his voting and policies, he doesn't give a fuck about poor people. \n\nI feel it's important for me to say this, because I don't want anyone thinking that his dad's generosity somehow makes Pete Ricketts a good human or governor. \n\n*EDIT: I think it's also worth pointing out that:\n\n* He tried and failed to sue Colorado for their marijuana laws because it made it more difficult to arrest people in Nebraska with weed they got across the border. Aside from the fact that it's horseshit to arrest someone for weed, it's Nebraska's choice to enforce that particular law. I live in Colorado now, so I got to fund both sides of this dumpster-fire with my tax money. \n* Nebraska's legislature voted to repeal the death penalty. It was great. But instead of letting it go, he spent a bunch of his own money funding groups who were trying to reverse the repeal. He also used taxpayer money to try and illegally buy death drugs from India, and the feds told him it was illegal, and if he kept trying it, they'd arrest him. Now, he's still fighting it and somehow was able to put a human rights issue on the ballot this next week. Why don't we vote on whether women are people, too, while we're at it. \n* He spent a bunch of money creating a new license plate with a design he stole from someone who ripped it off themselves. He didn't check with anyone before doing this. When he unveiled it, people hated it, and so he backtracked and made a new license plate. You know, instead of being a grown up and living with his decisions, he succumbed to popular opinion. This was all very expensive. \n\nLet me also remind folks that Ricketts ran and won the governorship under the conservative agenda, which in Nebraska is truly conservative: Nebraskans take frugality very seriously. It's in the state's constitution that they can't go into debt, and there's nothing worse than being wasteful. I'm not a conservative, but none of that sounds bad to me. \n\nSince being elected, he's done nothing but squander millions of taxpayer dollars on failed projects that stemmed from ulterior motives, and he's done it all without bothering to check with the people of Nebraska. He's a clueless, naive, trust-fund daddy's boy who's never done an honest day's work in his fucking life, and he has no comprehension of what it means to be a struggling American. He has no concept of money, except that he can spend as much as he wants even though he's never earned it, and he doesn't give a good god damn about poor people, minorities, immigrants, the middle class, small business, or anything else. \n\n**FUCK HIM IN THE DICK-HOLE WITH A PINE-CONE DUSTED IN ASBESTOS POWER**"], [50, "Sarah Spain is hot"], [39, "My cousin works for the Cubs and was part of this trip - the tickets they got were face value; Ricketts wasn't paying thousands per ticket.\n\nEither way it's an amazing thing to do, and I know my cousin (and his wife) absolutely loves working for the Cubs and that they do stuff like this for their employees.

Hockey has always been my sport, but the emotions filling me up inspired this account of a small Englishwoman and her beloved Cubs. (Cross-posted from the /r/askreddit thread)*\n\nMy grandmother moved from a tiny village in England to a small town in Canada in the late 1940s, by way of a cross-continental bus trip starting in New York City. In that small fishing town where most of her children still live, she fell in love with and married my grandfather, a doctor from Ireland. Somewhere along the line, despite living in a country obsessed with the sport of hockey, she became enamoured with baseball. Nobody knows exactly why, but at some point she chose the Chicago Cubs as her team. Her love of her Cubbies never wavered, even though year after year she saw them fail to claim baseball's ultimate prize. \n\nShe loved Ryne Sandberg - she thought he was cute. Harry Caray was naturally her favourite commentator. My fondest memories as a child are of watching the Cubbies with my grandma in the basement of her house. If the Cubbies were winning, she would rib my granddad, a Cardinals fan. If the Cubbies were losing, she would lose all of her proper English manners and scream and curse at the TV like any of the most passionate Canadian sports fans you can meet. \n\nOne of the most exciting times of my life was the home run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. Of course, it seemed inevitable in our family that the two sluggers chasing baseball's most prestigious record should represent the favourite teams of my grandmother and grandfather, respectively. When Sosa lost out to McGwire, my grandma was beside herself. Once again, a Cubbie had fallen short.\n\nI remember the infamous Steve Bartman incident. I remember how, prior to his snatching the ball out of Moises Alou's glove, Sammy Sosa launched a bomb out of Wrigley Field. My grandma stood up and cheered. When Bartman did what he did, all five-foot-nothing of my grandma launched out of her chair, wagging her finger at the TV as she screamed and cursed at the top of her lungs. Though it was never easy to be a Cubs fan, she never wavered in her support of baseball's perennial underdogs. She would joke often that she refused to die before her Cubbies won a World Series.\n\nMy grandfather was very ill when the Cardinals won in 2006, and in fact died not long after that series. I remember him refusing to go to bed before the end of the final game, storming out of his bedroom in his underwear with my aunt in tow, bursting into the TV room with a huge smile on his face to see his team claim the championship. My grandma was naturally happy for her dying husband, but she still harboured some competitive resentment that *his* team got to win so much (going back to the 60s and 80s) before her beloved Cubbies.\n\nAfter my grandfather died, my grandma lived alone in the large house where they raised their six children. She hated it. It was empty and quiet and undoubtedly lonely, probably the loneliest she'd ever felt. Even though we'd visit her often, her favourite days were those with Cubs games, because the whole family would gather to watch the team with her. \n\nOver the past five years or so, my grandma has had to suffer with terrible Alzheimer's and dementia. She's lived in a home for a long time, and we've all had to watch as she slowly lost her faculties. Now, on a good day she'll recognise her own children, but mostly she stares flatly into the distance. It crushes me to see the vibrant, sassy woman who helped raise me as my mother struggled with alcoholism reduced to a shell of her older self. It crushes me more to see what her current condition does to my father and his siblings. They wear the years of her illnesses on their faces in heavy lines and sunken expressions. Something we could always hold on to was Cubs games. We'd sit with her, holding her hand as she slept or stared at the floor, watching the Cubs on the big screen in the home. \n\nWhen the Cubs started getting it together these past couple of years, everybody in my family would share sidelong glances of optimism, never daring to say aloud what we all hoped: that they might finally win a World Series for grandma. This past week has been an emotional roller coaster. During Game 6, my brother and his family showed up with a Cubs cap for my grandma. He put it on her head, and she grabbed his hands. She was murmuring *something* to him, but nobody could understand her; her speech has long since left her. My brother's daughter, all of five years old, touched his arm and said, \"Daddy, she's trying to thank you.\" My brother looked my grandma in the eyes and said, \"You're welcome.\" She sighed deeply, let go of his hands, and fixed her sight on the game. \n\nTonight, everybody in my family who still lives in the small fishing town my grandparents decided to call home was in my grandma's room, watching the Cubs game. Cousins living in different cities were Facetiming so we could all watch it as a family. We were getting text updates from aunties and uncles watching hundreds of miles away. What a game! One of the best baseball games I've ever seen: a game full of ups and downs, joy and despair, optimism and pessimism. My grandma was wearing her new Cubs hat, but she slept through the entire game until the 9th inning, at which point most of us joked that she would probably want to go back to sleep.\n\nWhen the final out came in the bottom of the 10th, we cheered as loudly as we could at 10 o'clock in an old persons' home. We cracked open a bottle of champagne and my uncle took my grandma by the hands and told her that her Cubbies had won the World Series. We weren't sure if she understood what was going on, but she looked from my uncle to the screen and back again, and suddenly her old experienced eyes welled with tears and a huge grin spread across her face. She laid her head back in her wheelchair and relaxed. We snuck her some champagne - she's not allowed to drink but damn it, she deserves it - and all shared hugs as the celebrations carried on on the TV and around the room. \n\nAs I finish this, there are over 8000 comments and I know it will likely get buried, but I wanted to share the experience of a dedicated, lifelong Cubs fan. I know my grandma isn't the only old-timer with tears in their eyes tonight. Sports can seem petty at times, or base or meaningless, but seeing the reaction of my grandma - seeing her lucidity and understanding that her Cubbies had finally done it after decades of failure - was a stark reminder of the beauty and power and poetry of sports, especially the sport of baseball. It's tied to so many wonderful memories I have of my family, and tonight the Chicago Cubs gave us one more. I won't forget it for as long as I live, and I know my grandma won't either."], [508, "#To think, all this time the Cubs just needed to add jumbotrons to Wrigley to win a World Series!"], [492, "A Chicago man dies and goes to hell.

It says: \u201cLET HIM IN! to the restroom with your daughter or else you\u2019re a narrow-minded, judgmental, unloving racist bigot who needs to die.\u201d\n\n>To that, Schilling added: \u201cA man is a man no matter what they call themselves. I don\u2019t care what they are, who they sleep with, men\u2019s room was designed for the penis, women\u2019s not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic.\u201d\n\n>\u201cESPN is an inclusive company,\u201d ESPN said in a statement. \u201cCurt Schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated.\u201d\n\n>Schilling, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment.\n\n>It was the latest in a number of commentaries by Schilling on social media that have drawn controversy. He was suspended for a month after he posted a comment on Twitter in August that compared radical Muslims to Nazis.\n\n>Earlier Wednesday, Schilling appeared on a radio show in Boston where he defended himself against accusations of intolerance and racism.\n\n> \u201cTo be in a place where people actually believe I\u2019m a racist or I\u2019m transphobic says to me that something has gone horribly askew somewhere,\u201d he told the hosts on WEEI, sounding weary and bewildered by his latest social media furor.\n\n>Schilling told WEEI: \u201cI replied to the post. I didn\u2019t post that.\u201d\n\n>But a screen image captured by Outsports.com showed that Schilling had shared it and added his own comment.\n\n>On his personal blog on Tuesday, Schilling did not back down, even as advocates in the transgender community called for his dismissal.\n\n>\u201cLet\u2019s make one thing clear right upfront,\u2019\u2019 he wrote. \u201cIf you get offended by ANYTHING in this post, that\u2019s your fault, all yours.\u201d He added: \u201cThis latest brew ha ha is beyond hilarious. I didn\u2019t post that ugly picture. I made a comment about the basic functionality of men\u2019s and women\u2019s restrooms, period.\u201d\n\n>His son, Grant, defended his father Tuesday on Facebook, saying: \u201cAnd while I will say he\u2019s not the most well informed in the modern LGBT+ culture, i can assure you he\u2019s made great strides to understand people today. If he were a bigot he wouldn\u2019t have allowed my Trans friends to stay over, he\u2019s respected pronouns and name changes- never once have I heard him say something to me that I thought he should keep quiet about.\u201d\n\n>Schilling\u2019s suspension last season led to Jessica Mendoza replacing him on ESPN\u2019s marquee \u201cSunday Night Baseball\u201d broadcasts. He was subsequently reassigned to the network\u2019s games on Monday nights.\n\n>Last month, he waded into politics on a Kansas City radio station when he suggested that Hillary Clinton \u201cshould be buried under a jail somewhere\u201d if she gave \u201cclassified information on hundreds if not thousands of emails on a public server, after what happened to General Petraeus.\u201d\n\n>Last year, Petraeus, a former C.I.A. director and a top general from the wars in Iran and Afghanistan, was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation by a federal judge for providing classified information to a woman with whom he was having an affair.\n\n>Analysts said ESPN was left with little choice after Schilling\u2019s repeated offenses.\n\n>\u201cIf you\u2019re taking a paycheck form ESPN, you have to be extra careful about how you communicate publicly and always err on the side of caution and responsibility,\u2019\u2019 said James Andrew Miller, co-author of \u201cThose Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s not an unfair or impractical position for ESPN to hold,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201c If you want to express your own opinions in a provocative way on social media, then ESPN and a lot of other media organizations are probably not where you should be working.\u201d\n\n>Schilling describes himself on his Facebook account as a \u201cConservative pro life pro 2nd amendment American who wants to help those that cannot help themselves.\u201d\n\n>Schilling, a six-time All-Star, was one of baseball\u2019s top pitchers over a 20-year career and compiled a record of 216-146 for the Baltimore Orioles, the Houston Astros, the Philadelphia Phillies, the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Boston Red Sox. He was even better in the postseason, with an 11-2 record and a 2.23 E.R.A.\n\n>But he is perhaps best known for pitching in the 2004 American League Championship Series against the Yankees with his right sock bloody from a procedure that had been used to secure a dislocated tendon in his right ankle.

Last night I decided to watch a bit of the game just incase we won. I saw the last 2 innings, and I was surprised when I saw Chapman pitching. I was thinking I must be confusing him for someone else, since the guy in the documentary was on a red team and the Cubs are blue, but nope. *It was him.* This is the most recent fastest pitcher in the game. And he's playing against the Indians. I don't know how the Land has won 3. But I knew the Indians were doomed from that point on. \n\nAnd we lost.\n\nBut I watched the game, and it was kinda fun.

It is an effective certainty that of the approximately 6,300 people at Detroit's Bennett Park on October 14, 1908, none are still alive. The memory of the Cubs' victory, be it witnessed, read, or overheard, exists in the mind of no person. Great-great-grandparents born after that date are being buried.\n\nThe Cubs were the first team to win the World Series twice. Since then, the world has marched on and the game has rebuilt itself time and again. Of the original sixteen teams, the Cubs (and the Indians) are now tied for last among franchise championships. But they have not been left behind. They have not folded or moved; they have thrived as one of the most popular teams in the country. It is the romance of eternal struggle which brings the world to Wrigley, a struggle against the odds, against time, against the dying of the light. All people, all Americans know this struggle deep within them; it is where baseball becomes a metaphor for life. It is why we come back to this game every spring: the standings reset, the grass is fresh, and the promise of the dream stretches before us.\n\nAnd *every once in a while* you get your chance to break through."], [3084, "Kershaw removes his mask.

The dude next to me noticed what I was referring to and started to count off with me. \"Four!\". Now the pitcher pitches. So we have to start over. \n\n\"One!\", \"Two!\". Now the 5 or 6 people immediately around us notice it and they join in. \"Three!\", \"Four!\" The pitcher pitches. I don't remember the count but there was no contact so the AB continues. We start counting again but now half the student section joins in. We're all counting off at the top of our lungs. This time the pitcher starts to understand what is happening and cant stop smirking, we're distracting our own pitcher so he takes even longer to throw the pitch. \n\nSo now our pitcher is taking forever and we're counting off all of Levine's little swings. \"One!\", \"Two!\", \"Three!\". This time we reach 7! Our pitcher pitches and Levine grounds out. \n\nA few innings go by and Jake Levine comes back around. We told everyone nearby that Levine was due up 4th this inning so if any one got on base we were going to have some fun. 2 outs and a single later, Levine comes back to bat. The people around me and I start yelling, \"all together now!\" And surely enough we got the entire stadium to do it. Granted we don't have the crowd that a TAMU, LSU or UF game gets but we had maybe 1500 people there and they all start counting off. \"One!\", \"Two!\", \"Three!\" \"Four!\". Pitcher pitches. We start over. \"One!\", \"Two!\", \"Three!\" \"Four!\" the pitcher cant take it and throws to first base. The runner is back in time. Start over. \"One!\", \"Two!\", this time we don't get too high because the pitcher tries for first again and the runner is back on time. We started couting again and we reach \"Eight!\". Our high score so far. I kid you not when I say that he threw to first 5 consecutive times. On the fifth pick off attempt he actually gets the runner and the inning is over. \n\nWe heckled that hitter so hard that caused our pitcher to keep having to do a pick off attempt and he eventually got the runner. It was amazing. \n\n\n**TL;DR: I noticed a tick on a player from the other team at a college game. Taunted him so hard that our pitcher couldn't focus because he was laughing. He kept throwing to first base to restart his motions.

Anyone who knows that I follow baseball already knows that the dominant pitchers are what fascinate me in the sport and Jose Fernandez was incredible as a pitcher.\n\nWhat drew me more towards liking him as a person was just how much passion he displayed for the game. He was constantly smiling on the field, and he would celebrate his teammate's big plays just as much as he would his own, even if he was just in the dugout. Sure, he may have come across as cocky at times, but to me, it seemed like he was just caught up in the moment and genuinely enjoying himself.\n\nHe became someone that I genuinely wanted to succeed not just because of how amazing his pitches looked but also because of the stories of his incredible filial ties, and the trying times surrounding his initial defection from Cuba. Those displays of human emotion coupled with unbridled display of enjoyment of the sport made me want to see him succeed.\n\nSadly, his career was nipped in the bud and we will not see him eventually become one of the all-time greats.

Jose's home record is unbelievable at 27-2. He had a 30% strikeout rate. It's just mind-boggling how good he is. More importantly, he loved the game so much.

My first year watch baseball and my home states team won the World Series?! Was meant to be. I took every opportunity I could to catch a game. During a few years things got bad, really bad we lost some all stars, suffered through a ton of injuries, and lousy seasons. I remember going to home game after home game where I had shitty tickets but we'd all take seats up close anywhere we could because literally no one was at sunlife stadium. \n\nThen news started to come around that we were getting our own stadium, and I couldn't wait. But with that came a shit ton of changes that in my view was a little ill received. The stadium plans at first seemed ridiculous (the home run statue??), the rebranding from the \"Florida Marlins\" to the \"Miami Marlins\" and the new color schemes seemed to kitschy, to flashy for a struggling team, especially one that was pretty much rebuilt from the ground up after our worst season, but needless to say they were my home team and I stuck with it. We even lost our first game at our new stadium, for a while it was hard to be a Marlins fan. By 2013 I still hadn't been able to catch a game at the stadium but some time had past and a friend of mine was like \"hey! Come check out this GIF!\" I hadn't seen it before but it was the one where Jose catches his pitch in the Colorado game, and I was like \"that's so awesome! That's my team!\" I missed the influx of a lot of the new players but the internet culture brought me back, I had to see this new player that everyone was talking about/making gifs about. It sounds silly but it gained a new aspect of fascination when I told people I was a Marlins fan \"Did you see that awesome GIF of your pitcher?\"\n\nI adopted a cat sometime around there and named him Marlin. He's an awesome cat, and he's named after and awesome team. \n\nWhen I met who is now my husband I was very adamant about sports in general and we planned a trip to Atlanta around going to see the Marlins play the Braves. I told him about a silly celebrity crush I had on their rookie pitcher and he surprised me with Fernandez jerseys. We both wore them at sat on the braves side at turner field. Unfortunately Fernandez was out getting tommy john surgery but we vowed that when we went back to my home town we'd catch a game so we could watch Fernandez play. \n\nThat was 2 years ago. We moved to TX but it was always in the back of our minds to catch a game at the stadium whenever we made a trip back to Florida. We kept up with stats and news, and were really excited with where the team was going. For someone who doesn't understand it's hard to explain why this is so heart wrenching. I and many others lost our favorite player, on our favorite team, and I just want to go home. I want to be with other fans, I want to mourn. I want to tell Mama, and Abulea that I am so sorry.  I have shed literal tears this weekend over this. I am just so sad. \n\nJose was a part of the new dream team for me, and him and the new guys that came in around that time made all the changes make sense. The rebranding, the logos, they embodied the colorful Miami culture. His exuberance was palpable, his story was so relatable to so many of the residents of Miami, and that's what made the team so \"reachable,\" and that similarity is what made being a Marlins Fan like being a part of a family. In spite of some of the politics of baseball, Jose was simply happy to be there. He was a hard worker, and a great teammate who took absolute joy in celebrating his teammates successes. It's going to be so hard, I am so devastated, but I love my team.

He then walked around the store and found the people with the fullest carts and handed them a gift card, wanting nothing more than to see the smile on their faces when a stranger helped them with grocery shopping. \n\nOne of the requests he had for his funeral was that memorial cards with his face, name, and DOB & DOD on one side and the quote, \"Too often we underestimate the power of kindness. It's in the smallest act of caring that we change the lives of others. A touch, a smile, encouraging words, a listening ear, a compliment; even paying for someone behind you in the drive-thru.\" Every guest received a set of these cards, and they were to be given to the recipient of a random act of kindness. Recipients were asked to share their experience on a Facebook page in his memory. I keep one of these cards in my wallet to keep him close to me every time I leave my house. \n\nJose seemed a lot like him, and it kills me to read more and more into this story. This is the first time I've cried since my cousin's funeral, and I'm sitting here bawling like a baby. \n\nHug your loved ones. Do something nice for someone every day. Live life with the joy, happiness, and energy that my cousin and Jose did. You never know when the last goodbye will ever be. \n\nRest in Peace JoFer.

I watched the video where they brought Fernandez's abuela to Miami from Cuba and just to see the reaction was so incredibly personal and human that you can't help but be moved. Jose talked about how she taught him how to catch when he was a kid and really pushed him to be the best that he could be, and it paid dividends. Before she was allowed entry into the US, she would climb on top of her roof with a radio so that she could listen to the Spanish-language broadcast of Marlins games whenever her grandson pitched. She was the proudest woman in the world. It breaks my heart to a thousand pieces to imagine what his family must be going through. I loved watching him pitch. I've never been to Miami but I became an honorary Marlins fan this season when it looked like they had a shot at the Wild Card and watched Fernandez with awe at how utterly dominant he was...he threw blistering heat and he had one of the most disgusting changeups an curveballs I've ever seen in my life. It's just unreal to me that I'll never see that again. I am so, so sorry.
