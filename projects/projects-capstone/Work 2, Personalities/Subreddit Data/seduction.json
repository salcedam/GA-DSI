I've bought DSLR cameras taken thousands of pictures and then moved on (eventually settling on something I truly I enjoy). The problem with the word passion, is that we tend to think of it as this magic pill that will bring us to life--its not. I had a vision that I wanted to write and it didn't all come to me at once. It took determination and I sough guidance online from author's to know what to look for. It took the discipline and hard work to start reading a lot. After sowing those seeds I began to feel confident and began to write fiction. It's a work in progress. \n\nThe greatest difference between myself three years ago and today when I go on a date is talking about what I'm passionate about.

And most fields of study, for the purposes of discussion, can be boiled down to their history, core knowledge, and famous associated people - not a set-in-stone categorization, but fairly applicable to most fields. And if you look back at my post, I'd be asking these things to the other person first, and only then interjecting with what I want to say. What's the use of asking about something and not connecting it with your own knowledge and experiences? Doing so is wasteful curiosity, if anything - and doesn't build any intellectual or emotional connection. So I'd love to see how you define curiosity, as it's clearly beyond me.\n\n> Your first paragraph is the most boring thing I've ever read on this site.\n\nFair enough; your opinion, but I'm sure an architect would disagree.

I actually emphasized separating the intellectual from the emotional aspects of conversation; I don't discuss those topics to \"elicit emotions\" - that's a pretty stupid assumption on your part. You seem to have a tendency to speak/write before thinking or trying to understand someone's perspective. Also, I'd be artificially \"directing someone to specific talking points\" if I rigidly stuck to that structure, regardless of what the other person says. I never implied it to be such a strict, rigid structure. The other person can speak what he or she wants and I can thread the conversation accordingly; but there's nothing wrong with asking whether he or she is familiar with a specific artist - if she is, then great that's a nice commonality (and potential plan for a future date).

Similarly with a person's passions, instead of broadly (and boringly) painting it as \"interesting\" or \"cool, discussing specifics in greater depth has if anything met with greater appreciation. People who go into these specific fields do so on the most part out of an intrinsic passion; why shouldn't I use my knowledge to bring out that passion?\n\nAlso, let's get something clear; my own true passion is in surgery, which is completely remote from.the above topics.

Cialdini's principal of commitment explains why we do this even though on some level we *know* that nothing good will come of it. There is a tendency in every person to stick with things that aren't going well that is burned into our brains. It's a habit, and a bad one that needs to be broken. After reading influence, I stopped falling into the pattern of hammering away at situations that have little to no chance of success and focused my effort and time on situations that were likely to pay off. This helped immensely. \n\nAnother example using the exact same principle is that I became much more understanding of women who were with guys who weren't good for them. These women are not idiots. They know that their boyfriend/husband is not treating them right. They just can't bring themselves to \"abandon\" something that they've worked so hard to \"build\", even if it has no actual value. And when you stop judging those women for being in that relationship, your chances of eventually getting with them skyrockets exponentially. \n\nSocial proof. Read this chapter. Put plainly and simply, *this is one of the most important concepts you could ever learn for having more success with women*. \n\nFinally, and this may seem ridiculously simple and easy, but it really bears repeating. People who are well-liked are more influential than people who aren't liked. I don't know exactly why....maybe because of my upbringing or lingering resentment from having a rough childhood, but I spent way too much of my life contradicting people and making them feel bad about themselves. It took this book to help me be aware that deep down inside, I wanted to make people happy, but some sort of weird habit had built up in me to dig at people's insecurities. Breaking that habit -- holding my tongue whenever I was about to say something mean, and replacing that with something nice -- was a huge breakthrough. You would be surprised how easy it is to still get your point across while using a completely different tone. For example, if a girl tells a story about something dumb or ditzy, don't say, \"wow, that was pretty stupid of you.\" Say, \"that's just adorable\". You are essentially saying the same thing but in a much nicer and more likable way. \n\nAnd maybe I'm in the minority for needing to make myself more likable, but man did it make a huge difference.

My undergrad years were spent at a university that had over 30k students, a big Greek Life scene (25% of the population), and a major football program. I would see all sorts of IOIs from some cute girls on campus but it never really led to anything, even when I approached. A lot of the better looking girls were in sororities and most things social revolved around Greek Life.\n\nWanted to get a position in student government? Being in Greek Life helped a lot!\n\nWanted to get a leadership position in a major philanthropy? Being Greek helped a lot!\n\nWanted to get a job as a bartender in the campus nightlife scene? Being Greek was practically mandatory.\n\nI would make some small talk and approaches but it really led nowhere. Even the numbers meant nothing because the girls I was after, they were busy with their practically mandatory social life things (sorority girls are that way). Not only that, even the girls not associated with Greek Life were all wanting to chase status. I did have some luck eventually but it came by hard, people were very busy with their classes and everyone had a lot of exams. I too had a lot to get done because I was in a demanding major.\n\nLooking back at it, it was not easy at all for me. \n\nI work now, once I am done, I am done and I have the weekends to relax. In college, weekends meant studying and doing homework. I work weekends as a bartender, the quality of girls I get has gone through the roof. Tinder and Hinge have helped me meet some of the better looking women out there. I have money now, this means I can go places and believe me, there are concentrations of attractive women that gather in certain places like upscale clubs and nice destinations (most are not taken).\n\nCollege was hell for most guys, we just don't want to admit it to others but it is the truth. Even the frat boys I knew maybe fucked 5 different girls a year at most."], [3, "Holy shit, as a senior about to graduate college, I needed to hear this so bad. My university is almost 50% Greek life, and everything you said about status and snobbery was true. I have 6'2 male model looking friends who struggle immensely with girls b/c they're GDIs, while there are chubby guys in top frats who pull hot girls b/c of their status. I personally was a loner my first two years of college and ended up joining a lower-tier fraternity. I'm above average looking and have decent game, so it isn't hopeless for me. But the high-school mentality of my university definitely makes things a lot harder than they should be. "], [2, "Some of my comments have received downvotes and I have received some flak for this thread so I am going to defend some of my points. As I said though, you're hearing this from a guy who was in a higher status fraternity in his college years so I was definitely getting some action.\n\n1. Yes, the game doesn't get \"easier\" after college in terms of you can just sit around and meet people that way. The game gets easier in the sense that your efforts to meet people become more successful. In college you could have gone out and met the better looking girls but guess what, because of **proximity** and the high school mentality that carries over, you would not have had much luck. After college, this mentality goes away.\n\n2. If you did not run into a lot of single and good looking girls after college, I have no idea where you went and your answer better not be \"moved back in with my parents in the suburbs\". I moved to a fun city a couple years after graduation, hot girls were everywhere and PUA actually worked. At the bars, girls went out to meet guys rather than going out because their sororities wanted them to.\n\n3. \"Proximity\" isn't an advantage, no matter what anyone tells you. \"Proximity\" also means she is around others your age, this means high school all over again. Slept with that cute girl? Watch how everyone talks about it and it becomes gossip. You don't want that as someone who wants to sleep around because once you get that reputation, girls start to avoid you for it in college because no girl wants to be known as a \"slut\".\n\n4. The truth is, college was only good for a small number of guys. For most guys, college was shit. The amount of hot and single 18-21 year olds does not mean a thing when most of them are being suffocated by their social circles and judged based on everything they do.\n\n"], [2, "The good thing is, the skills you use to seduce girls are the same skills that help you get friends and become popular."], [2, "Well one thing is certain though. Never in your life will there be so many women your age in close proximity. Sure your life isn't over if you don't succeed in college, but the sheer number of women you could interact with without having to go anywhere far will likely never again be available to you. College is the by far the best time to go out,  meet new people and talk to women. "], [2, "  True to some degree, but in reality having been through it all...if you can't find a girl to have fun with in college...maybe change something about yourself. Yes, there are girls who will cockblock, yes there are girls who will only sleep with frat boys but there are so many types of women at a given university you gotta be able to find someone. \n\n\n\n  Those girls who are quick to judge based on some BS two second judgement are no fun anyways. Guys in college are hardly experts at sex...how long do you think the average guy lasts anyways? Especially after a night of drinking, whisky dick is pretty common. I went to a college with a reputation of being a party school, got to talk to a lot of different people and I have never heard one say they had good sex after drinking. The majority of times the answer was about the same, awkward and short and usually no communication the day after. Lots of girls, just like guys just want to get laid. It's up to the individual to make sure they're memorable so hopefully you get to muffdive again. Only problem is if a girl brings a random back to her dorm on the first night she might get labeled as a slut vs the guy who brings a random girl on the first night who would been seen as a quick player. \n\n\n  I agree that there are opportunities after college, but I'm just saying you really should not have trouble finding someone at college. I chased a tall german girl for the longest time, only to find out she lovedddd bald guys. It was her thing, everybody has a thing. \n\n\n\n  Girls are everywhere, walk outside and you'll see them. Sure, some may be taken but they still are human beings who are capable of conversation. Those ones who always complain loudly and give weird looks are...well no good anyways so you really don't have much to loose by just striking up a conversation. You get a confidence boost, and get to work on calming those nerves so that eventually when you do meet the right girl, you won't be debating in your head on what to do...it should be second nature to just go and talk. \n\n\n\n  Also remember after college not all girls are down with the nightclub/party scene. You meet very different people depending on what you do. If you do not enjoy the nightclub scene...maybe don't go expecting to have fun and pick someone up. People can tell very easily if you're comfortable in your environment. \n\n\n\n  I am someone who does not enjoy one night stands, the act of sex alone while great is not all I'm after. You guys all know that feeling, after you bust and if it was good you're most likely satisfied enough for at least an hour. How you keep a girl around is what you do after. OP is absolutely right that after college its more about what you bring to the table. So go out, or stay in and figure out who you are. \n\n\n\nI recently quit a decent paying job in a kitchen where I had power for a kitchen that makes me feel fresh out of culinary school.

There is no competing with them, greek life means everything at these schools.  You are a bit of an outcast socially if you are not a part of greek life.

You gotta have your shit together, strong social skills, have an interesting life, be physically attractive, etc. You have to rely on tons of cold approaches that will usually lead nowhere, waste more time and money on dates, and, oh yeah, have to deal with the stresses of adult life, not just midterms and finals. \n\nWe have a name for this, it's called not having game.

Everything you have said has been absolutely true in my case. \n\nLately I have been feeling down because I am about to graduate and haven't really experienced the fabled college glory.  It is so incredibly frustrating to me.  I have had no problem initially attracting girls, but it seems like once they realize that I'm not high status, I lose them.

We aren't talking about 25 scoobs who throw a party every weekend.  These fraternity houses cost upwards of 10 million dollars and have literally millions of dollars flowing through them every year.  They are regularly throwing parties that cost tens of thousands of dollars and hiring B-list rappers to come play for them.  There is no competing with them, greek life means everything at these schools.  You are a bit of an outcast socially if you are not a part of greek life.

I am just saying you are not going to throw a rager at your buddy's apartment and compete with them on a social level.  \n\nAnd no, you can't just befriend them and show up to their parties.

No one is perfect at socializing, but there are certain skills you can develop over time to make yourself friendlier and more approachable. Socializing like anything is just a skill that is perfected over time. The most important thing is listening. People love to talk about themselves, so you're going to want to listen 70% of the time, 20% of the time ask questions and lead the conversation, and 10% offer suggestions/opinions. The key to conversations are ensuring that you are a fun person to be around and letting people express themselves so that they associate good feelings with your presence. \n\nHowever, at this time I'd say your concern should be primarily personal development academically and socially, with women secondary. If you're cool to be around, other people will gravitate to you. I can assure you that things get better. In high school I made a small, close-knit friend group of outgoing guys and we have only grown more over time. I didn't get a girlfriend until the age of 19 and at this time in life I don't want one. I enjoy seeing different girls casually, but I like to put myself first. If they want to be along for the ride, they're welcome to join, but women should be an accessory to your life, not the focus. You are the prize. The sooner you know that, they sooner they will too. And there are few things better than a good wing-man. I have two amazing roommates who set me up with girls and I do the same.

And I agree that simply asking for a phone number is not the best way; I do a phone number exchange.  And as long as you're hitting it off with a girl, it's good to ask for a number exchange under the premise that you guys should hang out or go do something.  Whether or not a formal time and place to meet has been proposed in that first meeting, is not important.

Thank you."], [4, "When a girl says \"You're so sweet\", she's being a little distant and condescending, which means you might have accidentally pushed her up onto a pedestal with a compliment, implying she is above you and away from you. \n\nWhen you say the phrase \"You are ______-\" it's treating the girl like a far away object, effectively pushing her away from you.  \n\nGuys with a low self-image will usually compliment the girl as an act of honoring her and showing respect and deference, as part of an effort to seek rapport with the girl by disaying kindness, respectfulness and politeness.  \n\nThe girl will love such a display and will love the guy like a little puppy, and she will heartedly welcome him into her life in the friendzone capacity that he has just framed for himself.  \n\nHe will read her positive enthusiasm as a success in her attraction to him, not realizing that sweet smile is the same condescending way she looks at her dog. \n\nShe is just happy to have another faithful companion, and instead of just wagging his tail to please her, this one will be able to listen to her and offer pleasant conversation, which will please her even more.\n\nSo you need to ask yourself: is your goal to make every girl smile and feel comfortable?  Or is your goal to establish a male to female, masculine to feminine, dominant to submissive relationship with them?  One will not result in the other because each of those scenarios will only come at the expense of the other.\n\nA submissive reaction is not a comfortable smile.  A positive submissive reaction is a nervous and excited smile where she feels the giddiness of butterflies in her stomach, and a warm flush of redness that begins in the exposed part of her chest and slowly spreads up into her cheeks, and down into her panties.    \n\nA negative submissive reaction would be an uncomfortable grimace, a negative comment, or an angry, offended look. You took a stand and offered her a route in life that she did not want to take. \n\nIn deciding not to take it, she experiences a brief window of pain, frustration, and anger that she thinks she would have experienced if she took it.   This super-excited or angry emotion is HOW she decides how she feels about your proposal.

And as long as you're hitting it off with a girl, it's good to ask for a number exchange under the premise that you guys should hang out or go do something.  Whether or not a formal time and place to meet has been proposed in that first meeting, is not important.  What's important is that the girl seems cool and worth your time.......  and mutual attraction is present.\n\n________________________________\n\nAlso, I'd discourage usage of the word, \"date.\"  There's unintentional baggage involved with that word.  \n\n>6. Regardless of how it goes, I always end on a high note. I always say it was nice meeting them. Mainly because I might run into them again and I don't want any problems.\n\nIt's fine to say it was nice meeting them, if you can do so *authentically.*  Wishing them a nice day can also work if they were actually not nice to meet.  It's more important to be real than to try to fake liking them.  \n\nIf you want to avoid problems, just don't be a dick.  Don't be blunt or too overtly touchy feely upon the first meeting.\n\n>7. I ask them about their passions. I try to direct the conversation toward what they love to talk about, not just the mundane and regular.\n\nThis is good, but realize that the mundane and regular can so very easily lead to their emotions (i.e., passions) and motivations...... the things that make them tick.  \n\n> 8. I do pickup with a purpose. I never do pickup for the sake of doing pickup. I do pickup while going to work, while going to the coffee shop, or while waiting for the train. I am always doing something with my life.\n\nThis is a pretty good attitude.  :)\n\n>10. I text girls immediately after I meet them. Literally immediately. I text them something along the lines of \"It's the beautiful Jane! How is the lab? -heretogetbetter\". If they don't respond the same day I keep their number but delete the thread. Gotta make space for new threads.\n\nI agree with this.", "id": "cyfzvtk"}], [{"comment": "That's an excellent tip man! Thank you.", "id": "cyffsu3"}], [{"comment": "When a girl says \"You're so sweet\", she's being a little distant and condescending, which means you might have accidentally pushed her up onto a pedestal with a compliment, implying she is above you and away from you. \n\nWhen you say the phrase \"You are ______-\" it's treating the girl like a far away object, effectively pushing her away from you.  \n\nGuys with a low self-image will usually compliment the girl as an act of honoring her and showing respect and deference, as part of an effort to seek rapport with the girl by disaying kindness, respectfulness and politeness.  \n\nThe girl will love such a display and will love the guy like a little puppy, and she will heartedly welcome him into her life in the friendzone capacity that he has just framed for himself.  \n\nHe will read her positive enthusiasm as a success in her attraction to him, not realizing that sweet smile is the same condescending way she looks at her dog. \n\nShe is just happy to have another faithful companion, and instead of just wagging his tail to please her, this one will be able to listen to her and offer pleasant conversation, which will please her even more.\n\nSo you need to ask yourself: is your goal to make every girl smile and feel comfortable?  Or is your goal to establish a male to female, masculine to feminine, dominant to submissive relationship with them?  One will not result in the other because each of those scenarios will only come at the expense of the other.\n\nA submissive reaction is not a comfortable smile.  A positive submissive reaction is a nervous and excited smile where she feels the giddiness of butterflies in her stomach, and a warm flush of redness that begins in the exposed part of her chest and slowly spreads up into her cheeks, and down into her panties.    \n\nA negative submissive reaction would be an uncomfortable grimace, a negative comment, or an angry, offended look. You took a stand and offered her a route in life that she did not want to take. \n\nIn deciding not to take it, she experiences a brief window of pain, frustration, and anger that she thinks she would have experienced if she took it.   This super-excited or angry emotion is HOW she decides how she feels about your proposal.  So, in order to get an answer, in order to get her to choose to take or not to take a route with you, you have to elicit a strong emotion out of her.

When I learned about PUA and everything I slowly introduced it to my 5 close friends. One of them actually learned a lot of things along with me and have improved his pickup skills a lot. He always thanks me for showing him everything because it improved his life in general. The other 4 maybe read one article or watched a video that I showed them, but they never really tried to apply any of the knowledge. All the time one of these 4 friends come ask me for advice about women, even though I showed them all my source of knowledge years ago, but they didn't have the will to actually read, study and practice the things I did.

When I was active there the forum was full of good field reports, good content posts and people would always support each other in a really good way. If you had to be harsh about some wrong attitude of someone in a field report, people would be harsh to help the guy evolve. Recently I decided to take a look at the forum again and the vibe is completely different. There's much more people and it lacks the quality content it had before (maybe because of the high number of members). Field reports are also really weak (things like \"I went out and said hi to a girl but she didn't get attracted to me, what did I do wrong?\"). It looks like people aren't even trying.

When I was active there the forum was full of good field reports, good content posts and people would always support each other in a really good way. If you had to be harsh about some wrong attitude of someone in a field report, people would be harsh to help the guy evolve. Recently I decided to take a look at the forum again and the vibe is completely different. There's much more people and it lacks the quality content it had before (maybe because of the high number of members). Field reports are also really weak (things like \"I went out and said hi to a girl but she didn't get attracted to me, what did I do wrong?\"). It looks like people aren't even trying. They think seduction is something you magically learn when you sleep and that they will eventually learn it if they keep reading the forum.", "id": "cz6ytlc"}], [{"comment": "Honestly, I've been successful enough with Tinder that I do not need to go out at all to meet girls.

I suppose I'm stereotyping but that's not really my intent. I'm speaking from experience here. I recently blew it with a really great girl who was incredibly attracted to me at the beginning. She was clearly having a really good time throughout the first date, so I ramped it up physically. Perhaps I should have done more push/pull, but in any case I invited her back to my place and she declined. She did agree to a second date over text, and we went ice skating a few days later. Went to a bar afterwards, we kissed a bit and at one point I put my arm around her and caressed her back a bit. She claimed she had to go home when it was only 9:45pm. A few days later I text her and she responds saying it was nice getting to know me but she's not sure she wants to \"take it forward\". Thinking back, it was clear that while both dates started out well, she was having the least fun at the times I was trying to escalate, and she also wasn't really giving much back in return. \n\nThis experience got me thinking about two other first dates I'd been on previously with girls who pretty much ghosted me afterwards. I realized in those cases too the girls had seemingly been having a good time at first but became less comfortable the more physical I got. I think there's quite a bit of merit to the idea that the girl should *not* believe she could have you at any moment. If she's not escalating herself, and you're still going at it, what kind of message does that convey? Shouldn't you be a challenge? Guys who are clearly dying for sex on the first date are simply acting needy, period.\n\nNow I'm not saying I disagree with you in general, and I do know my execution could have been much better in each of the cases where I failed.

If you don't have friends, you're shit out of luck. People increase their friendships through friendships. So you need to have friends to get friends. A closed circle. If you're out of it.

Libraries might have events on their calendars that would allow you to get up in front of people and talk about various topics. Hell, even open mic nights would allow you to exercise a few of your passions.

It's the congregate for the lowest common denominator. \n\n* 1.2 - C'mon. Come on. Please. Dude. \"Not for them\". Yeah. We've all heard and said that. And instagram for inspiration? Unless you were merely lazy to dress yourself in a way you like which is just... I dunno, makes no sense. Care how you present yourself to yourself? Yeahhhhh. Sure. And the reason you went on instagram for \"inspiration\" is because you probably didn't know what kind of fag ass hairstyle or clothes get pussy wet. I know what styles don't get it wet because I wear them.\n\n\nAnd social. Yeah I already made a comment but\n\n\n* 2 - In the age of social media you either have friends or you don't. If you don't have friends, you're shit out of luck. People increase their friendships through friendships. So you need to have friends to get friends. A closed circle. If you're out of it.

I cut a lot of people out of my life in my early 20's because I smoked too much weed and got cynical about their lifestyle choices. I eventually got over myself, and realised that I wasn't superior to them, I just had a different outlook on life. \n\nYou like to write. Ever done nanowrimo? I know November has just ended, and maybe you don't like the idea of writing 50k words in a month due to quality vs quantity, but it's a challenge. 50k too easy? Extend it until it's a challenge. I found it connected me to other writers in my area through social nights. I didn't go to any \"write ins\", but I went to the social night once a week to talk to other people doing a similar interest to me. Sure, I didn't get on with all of them. But I connected with a few new people who I wouldn't have met otherwise. \n\nOther things I'd suggest are trying a new interest, despite it being intimidating to put yourself out there at the start. Sign up to a martial arts club. Try out soccer or beach volleyball. Do a short course at night school (creative writing?) so you find yourself in situations where you meet new people. One of my closest friends I met because we worked together. After talking about it for over a year, I eventually joined a Bjj club with him and met a new circle of people. \n\nFinally, travel.

It might even hinder you from approaching.\n\nSo when you do exposure therapy, I think its best to start doing something on the low scale of things that give you anxiety/panic.  So instead of going to a high level exposure as in your example, you do need to interact and approach.  \n\nSo maybe instead of a crush, or hot ass chick for that matter (depending of the severity of your SA), you:\n\nwave at regular people, or say hi while you walk by.\n\nmaybe next time, you say hi and smile, or keep eye contact.  Again, regular people.\n\nNow, remember, if those things don't give you panic whatsoever, you find something social that is slightly panicky. Maybe stricking up a conversation with a old person, employee at a store, whatever the case.  And you do this several time...I'd say 10 different people.\n\nNext you level up, and maybe talk to a cute girl at  a store or wave, or say high (again, depends on your level of SA).\n\nAnd you keep doing that, practice.  Practice? ...Yes, I'm talkin practice.\n\nSome people have SA from answering and/or talking on the phone.  So instead of just calling the your crush or some hot chick in your class, you start of slow (lower level stuff).\n\nSo when you work on the small stuff, you level up (just like in a video game) and then you work on stuff that is typically more anxiety inducing, until you wake up to that hot chick.\n\nYou have to rewire your thoughts/programming.   Your mind is triggered to fear for some reason and you have to retrain it.   My issue had been years of bullying along with a parent that was mentally/physically and emotionally abusive.  Many times in public.  I was always in ready-mode to wait on some kind of attack from her even though it wasn't daily.

For me it looks like a weak, degenerate shadow of myself as a young boy.\n\nYour power comes from imagining yourself embrace that shadow, and speaking to people as if it's yourself and your shadow speaking together. You're more powerful together than when you're trying to separate yourself from it.\n\nEven though it's a different practice, I found myself embracing the \"elephants\" in the situation when doing this.\n\nAnyway visualising your shadow is pretty intense, I like yours for it's simplicity and ease.", "id": "d0r95gw"}, {"comment": "Interesting.

It might even hinder you from approaching.\n\nSo when you do exposure therapy, I think its best to start doing something on the low scale of things that give you anxiety/panic.  So instead of going to a high level exposure as in your example, you do need to interact and approach.  \n\nSo maybe instead of a crush, or hot ass chick for that matter (depending of the severity of your SA), you:\n\nwave at regular people, or say hi while you walk by.\n\nmaybe next time, you say hi and smile, or keep eye contact.  Again, regular people.\n\nNow, remember, if those things don't give you panic whatsoever, you find something social that is slightly panicky. Maybe stricking up a conversation with a old person, employee at a store, whatever the case.  And you do this several time...I'd say 10 different people.\n\nNext you level up, and maybe talk to a cute girl at  a store or wave, or say high (again, depends on your level of SA).\n\nAnd you keep doing that, practice.  Practice? ...Yes, I'm talkin practice.\n\nSome people have SA from answering and/or talking on the phone.  So instead of just calling the your crush or some hot chick in your class, you start of slow (lower level stuff).\n\nSo when you work on the small stuff, you level up (just like in a video game) and then you work on stuff that is typically more anxiety inducing, until you wake up to that hot chick.\n\nYou have to rewire your thoughts/programming.   Your mind is triggered to fear for some reason and you have to retrain it.   My issue had been years of bullying along with a parent that was mentally/physically and emotionally abusive.  Many times in public.  I was always in ready-mode to wait on some kind of attack from her even though it wasn't daily.  So my mind was programmed to be in a semi-alert/panic state often.  \n\nIIRC correctly, exposure therapy might be part of CBT for both anxiety/depression.

Only make time for people who make time for you**\n\nIt doesn't matter how long or short it takes for a woman to respond to you. It doesn't matter how long or short her texts are. It doesn't matter when she sees your message. *All that matters is whether she shows up when it counts.* \n\nPeople make time for things that are important to them. When the rubber hits the road, all that matters is whether she agrees to that date with you, whether she shows up to that date, and whether she continues to see you after. \n\nEverything else over text/messaging is superficial. She can say or do whatever the hell she wants prior, but the only thing that is truly going to give you a sense of where she stands is if she puts her money where her mouth is.\n\nSo what you need to do is learn when to stop wasting your own time, and get her to make her decision about you.\n\n**2. No one is standing in your way**\n\nNo one out there is actively against you and wants to see you fail in achieving your goals. No one is even paying attention when you fail to succeed. No one is keeping score of how many times you have failed.\n\nThe next girl you meet isn't going to know about any of your past rejections, or how that one time you had an awkward approach, or how you said that stupid thing when you thought it was funny.\n\nIf at any moment, you decide that you want to become a person that can be successful with women, nobody on this earth is going to go out of their way to make sure you fail.\n\n**3. The world denies you absolutely nothing**\n\nThe only limitations you face are the ones that you have created for yourself. The world doesn't tell you \"You can't achieve success with women.\" *You have told yourself that.*\n\nSince you are not entitled to anything, *you deserve everything that you work for.* \n\nThe next time you feel like you can't do something, ask yourself this very important question: \n\n\"I *can't*, or I *won't*?\"\n\n**4. The only person you should try to impress is yourself**\n\nForget everyone else. 10 years ago, how many people were in your life that remains relevant to you today? How many people in your life do you anticipate will still be relevant to you in 10 years? \n\nFor as long as you live, the only person that will always be relevant to your life is you. Do the thing that will make you believe that you're a kickass motherfucker.\n\nWould you be more pleased with yourself if you were the naysayer or the go-getter? Would you respect yourself more if you gave it a shot and failed, or if you ensured your own failure by doing nothing? \n\n**5. You have the power to create the life that you want**\n\nDon't believe me? Consider this: What kind of person *don't* you want to be? \n\nA cruel person. An unintelligent person. A boring person. \n\nWhat kind of things do you to prevent yourself from being that person? You do nice things and care about others. You read, study, and learn. You engage yourself in hobbies that interest you.\n\nYou had the power to do those things not because someone gave you that power, but because you can do that of your own volition. And in doing so, you have used your own ability to become the person that you'd much rather be: good, intelligent, and interesting.\n\nLet's take another example: I don't want to be a person that can't succeed with women.\n\nWhat kind of things can you do to prevent yourself from being that person? In order to succeed, you must try. Anybody can try. You don't need special permission or powers to try. You're not asking yourself to never fail. You're asking yourself to try. \n\nAnd in doing so, you have used your own ability to become the person that you'd much rather be: a person that is not afraid to try.", "id": "d9j4bxx"}, {"comment": "This is golden TRP material.", "id": "d9jqk1v"}, {"comment": "I like this as well.

Also reminded me that it's wrong to assume hot girls have a boyfriend. I'm 19, also a virgin, no shame. In late 2014 I had my first online date with a girl that was amazing, had a great conversation and kissed at the end of the date, but later I came off too strong and she didn't talk anymore. I learned a lot from that.\n\nHey bro, don't mean for my post to hijack your story but I want to share with you my little story because I felt a connection from you posts, I resonated. Congrats on changing yourself, if you ever feel doubt remember re-calibrating yourself is also good. \n\nAfter that I didn't get any more dates until around April this year; online girl from PoF that flaked and another one from tinder that wasn't physically what I expected. Later on in the summer, in July I went to Cuba to my hometown. People there a sexual animals...After five days or so I tell my friend that I want to go out to the club and the game begun. Started having fun there, became kind of eccentric because I wasn't fully there to pick up girls but to have fun and hang out with my bro (he has a gf). Anyways, he sets me up with one of his friends, we talk for some time and we start kissing and making out for quite  some time, this girl can do some crazy stuff with her tongue. That girl didn't meet later on like we agreed so I started approaching more and more girls at the club and at the park at downtown at night, long story short I kissed with another girls who was 15 years old before and later found out, it's not even a big deal there but she looked mature and everything, I was 18 at the time. Broke of with the girl a few days before returning but I became a lot more desensitized to rejection, to be honest alcohol (beer) helped me to loosen up a little. My cousin (who is sort of a cool guy), my friends, family all noticed how different I had become; in shape, tight clothes, funnier, more open, bold, direct. I didn't really told people that I was a tourist. I learned to put myself out there and make conversation out of anything.\n\nEDit: 15y/o girl cut me off, not me, so both of them sort of dumped me but whatever.\n\nSo, when I get back to the U.S after my 21 day trip I wanted to start a part time job at a supermarket. While I'm doing a computer training this cute girl comes in and started talking on the phone. She glances at me and then somewhere. I decided to ignore he because even though I wanted to hit on her I wasn't too interested. My cousin came after (works there) and told me that the girls told him that I'm cute. Before I leave I make sure to say hi and hug her, I didn't get her number. About two days later she texted me, my cus gave her my number. Long story short, I kinda liked here but wasn't \"feeling it\", took her out on three simple dates, kissed on the first. I figured, while this other guy also told me, that she was easy and wanted the D. I decided to tell her after two months that I wasn't feeling chemistry and we could star friends (honestly I just wanted to not talk to her anymore). Anyways, I worked for like three months, school had started, so I was focusing on myself and not concerned with gaming.   \n \nJust wanted to share because I saw myself in your story, it kinda hit me on a personal lever, you know?\nBy the way like someone said sharing to much by honesty my not be the best thing, but sometimes in the beginning it's good to do that so you can understand the whole picture, the as you progress you know how to go about the things you want to share.

I learned a lot from that.\n\nHey bro, don't mean for my post to hijack your story but I want to share with you my little story because I felt a connection from you posts, I resonated. Congrats on changing yourself, if you ever feel doubt remember re-calibrating yourself is also good. \n\nAfter that I didn't get any more dates until around April this year; online girl from PoF that flaked and another one from tinder that wasn't physically what I expected. Later on in the summer, in July I went to Cuba to my hometown. People there a sexual animals...After five days or so I tell my friend that I want to go out to the club and the game begun. Started having fun there, became kind of eccentric because I wasn't fully there to pick up girls but to have fun and hang out with my bro (he has a gf). Anyways, he sets me up with one of his friends, we talk for some time and we start kissing and making out for quite  some time, this girl can do some crazy stuff with her tongue. That girl didn't meet later on like we agreed so I started approaching more and more girls at the club and at the park at downtown at night, long story short I kissed with another girls who was 15 years old before and later found out, it's not even a big deal there but she looked mature and everything, I was 18 at the time. Broke of with the girl a few days before returning but I became a lot more desensitized to rejection, to be honest alcohol (beer) helped me to loosen up a little. My cousin (who is sort of a cool guy), my friends, family all noticed how different I had become; in shape, tight clothes, funnier, more open, bold, direct. I didn't really told people that I was a tourist. I learned to put myself out there and make conversation out of anything.\n\nEDit: 15y/o girl cut me off, not me, so both of them sort of dumped me but whatever.\n\nSo, when I get back to the U.S after my 21 day trip I wanted to start a part time job at a supermarket. While I'm doing a computer training this cute girl comes in and started talking on the phone. She glances at me and then somewhere. I decided to ignore he because even though I wanted to hit on her I wasn't too interested. My cousin came after (works there) and told me that the girls told him that I'm cute. Before I leave I make sure to say hi and hug her, I didn't get her number. About two days later she texted me, my cus gave her my number. Long story short, I kinda liked here but wasn't \"feeling it\", took her out on three simple dates, kissed on the first. I figured, while this other guy also told me, that she was easy and wanted the D. I decided to tell her after two months that I wasn't feeling chemistry and we could star friends (honestly I just wanted to not talk to her anymore). Anyways, I worked for like three months, school had started, so I was focusing on myself and not concerned with gaming.   \n \nJust wanted to share because I saw myself in your story, it kinda hit me on a personal lever, you know?\nBy the way like someone said sharing to much by honesty my not be the best thing, but sometimes in the beginning it's good to do that so you can understand the whole picture, the as you progress you know how to go about the things you want to share.

I'll try to keep it short and brief.\n\nI got there Saturday,December 19 and I hadn't slept in over 20 hours. That same night I went out with my friend and my cousin to the night club. It's a small town, everyone knows who people are, gossip is in the air 24/7. It was rainy that night but we hung out by the park, under a front porch before walking to the club later. While we are there talking, girl one from above, the one my friend set me up with in the summer (call her Letti), comes by with my other friend from primary school (kinder-5th). We say hello to them but I don't pay much attention to the girl I've been interested in. Then they go on their way. When the rain stops we hit the club, it was kind of empty for a Saturday but I liked the vibe. Letti is there as always hanging out with my old friend and a couple of other girls. I bring my cousin and my friend to dance front to front with them. We had some casual dance exchange but all this time I'm trying not to look interested in her. \n\nI can't remember if something similar happened on Sunday but I think I had some kino with her on purpose. Anyways, I get my friend on the game to go by her house and tell her we need to hang out (she wants to stay under the radar, remember gossip). No club on Monday   the 21st, nor Tuesday, however I did hang out at the park those days. I believe I saw her during those two days. Wednesday we have a special plan to hang out at the park with my friend and his gf and her with me. On that Wednesday (maybe my days are correct maybe not, it was probably Thursday) we hung out over 2 am, we were the only ones there. I was being myself and coming up with funny shit, just letting go. After that I went to walk her to her house (less than 1/4 mile away) and since everything was going well and she was interested I went for the kiss again while entering the dark street. We decide to go past her home to the bridge where it's dark so we can make out. Holy bitch, it was more intense than it was the previous time, grabbed her ass while furiously making out and grabbed some titties over clothes, it was passionate. Next day I plan with my friend to use his dad's clean hostel , which is next to my friend's sister. We go to the park and hang out for some time, then to my friend's sister little apartment which is literally right next to it. We drink a little bit of beer there, make out, listen to music, then I take her over to the hostel. Passionate making out, she tells me nothing more is going to happen, she's insecure because \"she doesn't want people to gossip\", in the scenario that she would be with me for the money because it's a common thing there. Anyways we are finally doing more, get her shirt off.....and it goes from there. *FINALLY lost my V-Card*. \n\nWell, it was all good, walked her to her house at 3 am. Next day we plan to go out, she didn't show up to the park, and I knew she would ditch me like she did in the summer. I go to the club anyways. After a while I noticed she wouldn't come (deja vu, kind of) so I started approaching, and to be honest I kind of felt let down (not trying to go the oneites way. My energy wasn't too high but I approached this group of cute girls, I decided to do it in a playful way by telling one of them that we would share the tiny seat (this is cute Blonde). I was more interested in that one but decided to go for her cousin whom is this beautiful well dressed girl. This young lady is shy and I tell her straight up, she laughed and smiled and was hard to get anything out of her. Gave her up and guess who showed up later? Letti showed up, she looked tipsy, had smoked too... I grabbed her and danced, after the second time I took her to dance she told me she didn't want to be seen with me in public like that (bitch please, the whole town knew already), she went off to dance with my cousin for a moment and quickly switched off to two other guys. I was not exactly feeling jealous at that point but rather disappointing and let down, I thought I would be able to keep Letti during my time over there. Before the music stopped playing I told myself that I would leave the club without looking back if Letti didn't talk to me soon. That's what happened and before it ended I just got out with my shoulders back and didn't look back for anyone. In a way I felt liberated while doing that. My friend tried calling me but I didn't look back...**my cousin didn't even try to reach me**. After I arrived to my house my friend and his sister's brother showed up to see what was up with me, I told them that I didn't want to be wasting my time chasing whores, if she was genuinely interested she wouldn't do that and our thing would be straight, **none of that game playing bullshit, no time to waste on her anymore.**\n\nNext day a good old friend of mine showed up in town since he had a 1 day pass from the army-service (my other friend had gone back to his service, with occasional    1 day pass here and there too) so I invited him to go uptown and if it was empty we would go to the next town over (bigger) to drink and have fun because a band was coming to play. That group plays old type of music native to Cuba and such but there would be a lot of people there with a nice atmosphere to have fun and talk to some girls. Anyways, uptown at the park was empty except for a little group waiting to go to the other town, she was there, I grabbed her and told her that I like to be clear with things and how I wanted to proceed, walked her, once again she pulled that shit about people in town knowing about us. After some talking, and her saying  no, I finally let go. So, I went back to my friend, got on a car and went to the other town. My friend and I were catching up on random stuff and talking about life, walking around (open plaza, amphitheater style, full of people), She showed up later but it was pointless to keep thinking about her or try to chase her so I go to a group of girls, they smile and act nice, they know I'm not from there...No success with women this time, although I only tried talking to one. Went off to get more beer and dance with another group to finish it off for the night. Before coming back to the US I'd heard she had found some other boyfriend already, yeah that quick bro.\n\nUgh...don't feel like writing  much more but will mention that I had a good time dancing with this other fine girl that actually has good morals, charisma, and she was cool with me. Oh she is also cousin with cute blonde and the other cousin, and good friends with my boys gf. However my time was limited and I didn't go there to blindly hookup, she wouldn't do that that easily, plus she is from a family with good status, same as her cousin. One acquaintance had told me that those girls could choose whoever they wanted... Anyways, cute Blonde from before would notice me often and say hi to me, very charismatic, she is pretty cool with me. I also forgot to mention that on the Monday,  after I arrived and before losing my V, I hit a nice nightclub in a bigger city on an open 11th floor, approached a girl in that area, that club is kind of exclusive in an economic way and not many people went that Monday so my cousin and I just danced it off with another group...that's another story. \n\n*Anyways man, whether you read this or not I'll consider it my compilation of thoughts that I needed to arrange, like a journal entry, to observe things on a 3rd person point of view. By the way I'm such a dumbass, I said I would keep it brief but got carried away hahahahahaha.*\n\n**Things that I learned, from what I wrote above and things that are excluded, in addition to other encounters.**\n\n* My style doesn't work everywhere\n\n* In order to fuck whores left and right I would need to be blowing money like it ain't nothing, which I don't want to \n\n* My small hometown has become very dirty in many different ways, mostly hookups and one night stands, it's gotten shitty\n\n* The feeling of sex is amazing and gives a great sense of intimacy\n\n* Chasing whores is a waste of time, I'm glad I don't get completely hooked on that one\n\n* My cousin is a snake, although we have a good relationship it mostly feels superficial and he's just looking out for himself, not being a little bitch, there are other details\n\n* Hitting on all possible girls for the sake of having sex is to shit on one self's reputation and integrity\n\n* Even though I paid for all the beers my friend has other materialistic interests and subliminally wants to use me (the first one from the summer and this story)\n\n* It's worth it to put your principles above anything\n\n* Like I always tell people: one comes first, fun, personal well being, exercise, etc. then girls\n\n* Alcohol is nice to loosen up but overdoing it makes you look like shit, learn to drink\n\n* Even when all girls go to the club not all of them are whores, they may like to dance and see what opportunities there are out there, that also being my style since I'm not a man whore (yet lol jk)\n\n* Feeling attached after sex might be a normal thing (it was my 1st time) but get over it\n\n* Don't shit where you eat, small town huge gossip, and I like to stay under the radar so no regrets for not calling to much attention to myself (Yuma)\n\n* It may be a hard thing to find another person that I can truly be romantic with, but I'll find that person one day through my endeavors \n\n* Keep approaching and tweaking your style\n\nDepending on what kind of trip I make to my hometown again, I will do more me and depend less on my \"friend\" to arrange things for me. I have gained status so I'll do things my way. The thing is that I just want to focus on myself and not give too many fucks about that place other than my family. Just want to move forward with my careers and personal life here... \n\nEDIT: Above all, know myself in order to make the right changes.", "id": "cyoxeqh"}], [{"comment": "why do you buy strangers coffee", "id": "cxxtwge"}, {"comment": "Read the book", "id": "cxy51d0"}, {"comment": "Where can I get it?", "id": "cxy7oa5"}, {"comment": "Everywhere its a very common book by dale carnage ", "id": "cxycw9f"}, {"comment": "Hey I bought you coffee\n\nThanks \n\nInteraction over ", "id": "cxycvt1"}, {"comment": "It's just a random act of kindness.

You don't need women in your life, but you are completely free to have this wish.

She should not be the main source of your happiness though. You find someone, not to complete you, because you already are. You do so because you want an addition in your life, even though you don't need it. Everybody thinks it's good to have someone by your side, but only because they are a bonus. It's a way to maximize our happiness, but only when we are content about ourselves. \n\nFind hobbies that you enjoy. Preferably something that will make you go outdoors and breath fresh air.

I saw this cute redhead half Russian girl from around school that I've passed by in my building multiple times, but we've never officially met. I was having a kick ass day before the party so I was already in a \"damn today has been great, fuck it\" kind of mood and introduced myself to her and we shook hands. I engaged in some small talk to get things flowing between us and then just kind of decided I wasn't going to try talking to her anymore. It was a random decision but I just felt like doing it. I got to some dancing when good music came on and in general just kept my kickass care free day going, eventually going for a beer. The people around me including myself were not 21 (at the time a few years back) and so everyone was afraid to go get one but I wanted a beer. \n\nSo I'm kicking it on the couch with my beer in hand, leaning back having a good time chatting up some people and close friends around me, and the cute redhead from before starts gravitating closer near me. Her body was pointing near me and she started trying to hang out with the people I was around, closer and closer to me where I was basically still just hanging out on a couch. Now here's the interesting part- she was invited to the party by the host who was TOTALLY into her. He kept coming into the chill zone I was at and kept trying to bring her outside where the music and the rest of the partygoers was. He was clearly a needy fellow and I clearly didn't give a fuck about him and just let him take her if he took her. She always ended up finding her way back in the chill zone and in the seat next to me anyway :). After some more talking and banter when the party was closing up she came up and asked me for my number after I was already having a great time with some friends. I was in a good mood and decided to fuck with her just a bit so when she handed me her phone I dialed 911 and hit call as I handed it back to her (so she had enough time to disconnect the call right away) as I laughed and teased her. She had a mini freak out moment but handed her phone back my way and I actually put in my number.\n\nShe invited me to a bonfire that a bunch of the people were going to after and it sounded like fun so I went. The needy guy was still around and trying to keep her away from me, but I was having fun and doing crazy shit (like convincing my friend and two other girls including the redhead to take their pants off by the fire with me). She ended up cutting connection with the other guy and we started hanging out. It was an awesome two months of great FWB sex. She was on birth control and clean as well so that was a plus.\n\nNever regretted dialing 911 that night.", "id": "cybe935"}, {"comment": "Just so you know, this is very stupid and childish and I hope nobody else does this.

It tricks a primal part of your brain into thinking you couldn\u2019t be in danger because you\u2019re eating.\n\n\nIf somebody is angry at you and you stay calm, they\u2019ll probably get angrier, but they\u2019ll be ashamed at themselves later.\n\n\nIf you ask someone a question and they only give you a partial answer, maintain eye-contact and stay silent. The person answering will usually assume that the original answer wasn\u2019t good enough, and they\u2019ll keep talking.\n\n\nEmotional expressions are one way to cause emotions. If you want to feel happy, smile as wide as you can.\n\n\nDon\u2019t say or write, \u201cI think\u201c or \u201dI believe\". It\u2019s implied anyway, and it sounds like you lack confidence.\n\n\nBefore interviews, imagine you\u2019re old friends with your interviewers. You\u2019re in charge of the way you perceive your situation, and your comfort will be infectious.\n\n\nIf you make yourself be really happy and excited to see other people, the next time they see you, they\u2019ll probably be a lot happier and more excited about it. (Dogs do this trick to us all the time!)\n\n\nPeople are more likely to agree to a smaller favour if they deny a larger one or two first.\n\n\nMany physical effects of stress are the same as those of exhilaration (e.g. heavy breathing, speeding heart, etc.) If you reframe your threatening situation as a challenging one, your stress will become exhilaration.\n\n\nMost people can\u2019t tell the difference between brilliance and confidence. If you seem like you know what you\u2019re doing, people tend to rally around you.\n\n\nIf you work in customer service, put a mirror behind you. Customers will be nicer because nobody wants to see themselves being a jerk.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in a group meeting and expect someone to take you to task, sit right next to them. They\u2019ll lose the pack mentality that makes them feel safe to attack you. At the very least, they\u2019ll mitigate their meanness.\n\n\nWhen you\u2019re on a first date, take your date somewhere exciting. They\u2019ll associate you with that thrilling feeling.\n\n\nTry to notice someone\u2019s eye colour when you meet them.

Nobody is paying as much attention to you as you are.  If you mess up, people will move on much faster than you will.  Don't let that stop you from just doing thing you want to do\"\n\nIt made me think it sounded very vain and arrogant - the idea that I assumed everyone was paying attention to me and focusing on me.  Being taller than average already had always made me feel like I stand out - people stare, people notice.  As a short guy, you could walk into the middle of that dance floor and just disappear.  As a 6'4\"+ guy, if I walk out there I feel like I've just started a comedy skit.  It's a tough balance.  Add in a period of time when people were generous with compliments on my looks and I was having no troubles finding companionship...it sets a standard in your mind.  You're always trying to live up to that and stay at that level.  But people get older. Things change.  And the person I was and want to be are still very different from who I am today.  \n\nAnd I'm often just over analytical about things. I'm hyper-aware.  I'm self conscious. I'm dissecting things, thinking about things. Going through this thought process in my head trying to sort out how I \"should\" be responding.  It's made me become much more cognizant of the people around me and the value of finding people I really connect with.  People I'm comfortable enough with to just not care (about criticism) and not over-think things.  I've found myself surrounded by people that I call \"friends\" but realizing that I'm not really close to any of them.  And that I feel like I fit in as a part of the \"group\" but that I don't think I'd get along great with many of them one-on-one.  Most of those \"real\" friends are people I've known for 15+ years - the type of relationships that get harder and harder to make as you get older.\n\nAnyhow, thanks for the article.

Tinder?\n\nIf your using an app like tinder, people usually do not read profiles. It's inefficient. \n\nYou have about 2 seconds to impress someone or you are swiped into oblivion forever. If you manage to capture their attention, they MIGHT read your profile. It's the unfortunate truth about these types of online dating. Either your hot, get a ton of matches, or your average and get next to none. A few Reddit experiments have shown that ugly people and average joes tend to get similar results on tinder, whereas hot guys get something closer to what an average looking girl would on tinder.\n\nIf you are serious about online dating, your better of using websites that allow you to \"approach\" a woman without them having matched with you. That way you can at least try to make an impression with something funny or interesting.\n\nI have the exact same results as you. In person, I can get numbers from girls who would normally be out of my league 7-8/10. On tinder, I have to drop my expectations to about a 4-5/10 if I want to get consistent matches."], [1, "Online dating isn't a fail. I get messages from girls on there maybe like 4-5 messages a week. Sometimes numbers if I can escalate properly. Some hot girls are online. There are also a ton of like 6's that are chubby and trying to compensate as well. Need to steer clear of those. Online dating is 50/50 kind of. There's like a certain way you have to approach it "], [1, "Online dating success is highly dependent on your level of physical attractiveness and texting game.\n\nI've personally had excellent luck with online dating. I get maybe a 30-40% response rate, and of those who respond, the majority agree to date me. This is with OKC; tinder has been significantly less successful because I have shit texting game.\n\nIt really depends on your goals and your strengths. I'm great at fucking up dates, so my online success doesn't help me much, but I wouldn't say day game is inherently superior to online dating or vice versa; just depends on what you're doing well with."], [1, "Not entirely. I've been using Tinder for about a month and I manage about 6-10 matches per day. I can turn most of them into numbers, and from there into dates. Putting in girls that flake, and girls that don't respond, I can easily get 2-3 dates off tinder per week. I've had good weeks where I'd have 4-5 dates in a week just from Tinder. Granted, I do live in a city with one of the top 20 universities in North America and a big college campus.\n\nSo online dating is definitely working out amazingly for me, but I do agree that real life is always better. Less flake rate, higher quality approaches, and best of all you'll KNOW right there if the girl is boring as shit or not, whereas on Tinder you're kind of hoping and praying that the girl isn't boring as fuck and you didn't waste your time driving 15 minutes for nothing."], [1, "Dude..You're playing a HUGE numbers game in bith areas.

If you do, it's after you liked about 120-240 girls.\n3. You probably don't realize this, but there are sooooooooooooo many ugly/fat girls on tinder, that you are probably getting 1000s of likes and never noticing because you never like them back. But would you ever want sex with them? Probably not. I even got super-liked by some fat chick, I felt so bad. \n\nAverage non-fatty, non-ugly girls are getting every guy they can dream of, off of tinder. For a guy, a hole is a hole and the really good looking guys, with six-packs, 6'+, are going on dates weekly off of tinder. They're not turning down and they barely have to say anything other than \"hey\".\n\nYou're an average skinny mediocre looking blond?

Probably not, but you may get a few dates eventually (so don't think it's impossible). You can get matches, but even the matches may not talk to you, because they matched with better-looking guys too. I mean, I even had a girlfriend from tinder, it's only too bad she was psycho, otherwise she'd have been great.\n- You should prefer night game or some other method.

Stop jacking off for a while until you grow the balls to make your first cold approaches. Go develop some one night stands and some short term flings until you get another girlfriend. Maintain frame way better, be much happier. Repeat past mistakes, slowly lose frame and get comfortable. She'll go traveling, but you won't be in denial. Call her out for her public cock-caurosel ride abroad with hacked facebook proof, YOLO. Break up. Full monk mode. See therapist to perfect your imperfections. Focus on weights, education, and your sport and not girls for the first time in your life. Reap the newfound attention and use it to boost confidence. Start online business, make legit money for your age. Make female friends. Have one of them hook you up in a date with the hottest girl at your campus who you used to only dream about ever having a shot with. Realize hot women are not all sluts, and can be genuine too. Feel like you hit the jackpot. Fuck up by trying to take things slow while simultaneously rushing relational shit, ignoring all your learning and practice this far. Lose her. Full YOLO; throw biggest party your school had ever seen in its history. Have random freshman call you the Van Wilder of your campus. Talk you way out of jail time and getting kicked out of your house simultaneously. Settle down, re-evaluate. Embrace the persona you created instead of wearing it on your sleeve. Go out drinking on your 22nd birthday. Meet the right girl for you. Perfect game and perfect frame, she leaves her boyfriend for you. She sleeps over the next month. You're perfect for each other. She leaves you anyways because she's moving to New York and you're both out of time, graduation is around the corner mere weeks away. Saw it coming. Surprisingly unphased and numb; realize you're now an empty shell of a man. Focus on self again to fill your insides with your own passions and successes for an entire summer; work online and hit the gym every day while getting paid to lifecoach men and share your success thus far with them. Now in hot guy territory, download tinder. Take it seriously, get some dates and a lay here and there. Travel the country, consider winning back the unicorn girl who things ended with on good terms by driving out to NY from the west coast. Shit goes terribly wrong. Almost die, get betrayed and robbed, lose everything you have. Have revelation that she's moved on an inch away from her doorbell. Don't bother. Refresh self. Tinder across the country, newfound success by not caring. Crash with all kinds. Move to a major city. Peacock your tinder profile. Land a career. Incorporate lifting. Make women laugh and give you their number. Frequent a classy bar until you're a regular. Bring a new hot girl there each week or so, taxi/uber back to your place after utilizing the inner game and physical escalation you picked up along the way. You're the prize now, and you have the experience and track record of countless women before you even moved here. Up your standards. Change your mindset and develop a more positive outlook on life. Improve your social circle. Question what happened to that scrawny kid from 6 years ago from time to time as you work on your novel in between coaching sessions, lift sessions, contract work, and hot lays. Always look forwards at how to improve and develop farther physical, social, and financial success. \n\nWho knows what's in store for me next. I'll tell you what though, there have been countless drops of sweat, tears, and blood shed along the way. Even I still have so much more to learn and so much more room to grow. Never stop learning. Being dumb will only cripple you, however acting dumb definitely should be a key tool in your arsenal. Work work work until you are the actual shit: the coolest guy in every room you step foot into. \n\nRemember; at its core, seduction is not your routine vs her defenses. It's you and your presentation vs every other one of her suitors and their presentation. This is why emphasizing yourself and your self-improvment above your significant others will do you a lot of good. Not to mention women love being a part of your story. Take a date. They want you to lead them on an adventure. Make their life more interesting and exciting. Marriages often fail because the man gets boring and the adventure becomes stale. \n\nSome of the best advice I ever got was \"Men are like islands, and women are like birds.

I'm talking about friends, not strangers.\n\nAs a more introvert person I'm somehow drawn to more extrovert people as friends. There is always place for one really extrovert person in my live at any moment, in my experience. Always very outspoken, assertive, outgoing, a little bit narcissist, likes attention, you know the deal... These relationships had their upsides and downsides. Besides all the fun and the energy, one of the downsides was them constantly testing boundaries. Always trying to establish some sort of power dynamic.\n\nI've lost extroverted friends over this in the past. I guess the friendships ended because they thought they had 'won' somehow, while I didn't gave a fuck about these moves. I was naive. Some people (most of them?) and even friends just walk over you if you let them.\n\nNow there is this really extrovert friend that I'm seeing for a couple of years. He also has the personality to test you and try out boundaries once in a while, getting a little too cocky about himself sometimes. I genuinely like hanging around with him, there are no dull moments, very energetic. So I don't see any reason ending the friendship. But being more aware of power dynamics lately I thought I had to try something different, because I didn't want to let this friendship die like some of them before either.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, there was this thing he said, I don't even know anymore what it was exactly, disrespecting me a little, or whining about something... anyway, I quickly moved my hand to his face and gave him a little bitch slap. Nothing hard, just a light tap to the cheek. He didn't see it coming, didn't expect it, and it immediately put him in a 'calm and submissive state'. I was not raising my voice or anything, I just told him calmly while smiling that he had to watch his words or something. A bit playful, but very effective. There was no pushing back or anything, he instantly turned into a less egoist state of mind. And the rest of the day he acted way more loyal and generous, for a change taking my preferences into account with the choice of music and volume, etc.\n\nNow I'm not advocating to slap your friends anytime they do something you don't like, but I realized it is a good 'tool' to use once in a while. Especially for me as a more introvert person dealing with the complete opposite on that spectrum. A light tap or quick touch somewhere shows them you can get to them. It helped balancing this friendship for me."]], [[{"comment": "Personally I feel akward and unnatural touching people. \"Here, let me me give you a random pat on the shoulder.\"", "id": "d7qnjeo"}, {"comment": "I thought the same thing too, but I made an effort to touch someone when it felt right.

I hear 2 things in your response. 1) you are not used to touching women (you said it\u2019s something you never did) and 2) I hear a limiting believe. (you say hands are for speaking, not for touching). I\u2019ll address both of them. Concerning nr 1: if it\u2019s the first time you did this, then it\u2019s absolutely normal that you feel that way. You just need to do it more often and you\u2019ll get used to it. Really. To proof this to yourself: think about something that felt unnatural in your life before and that now feels very natural. Just take a few minutes to do that. It\u2019ll help you a lot. Concerning nr 2: who said hands are for speaking, not for touching? If you choose to believe that, do you think it will help you? People need to touch each other. They really need it. Did you know that babies die if they are left untouched? Why do I ask all those rhetorical questions? Well because it\u2019s my way of helping you break your limiting believe. Sorry if it feels a bit harsh, but when you try to confront someone with his limiting believes it always feels kind of hard for that person. But I\u2019m doing it to help you (so forgive me). If your parents didn\u2019t decide to touch each other you would not exist. See what I mean? Also I can tell you from experience, been coaching introverted men to attract women naturally for more than 20 years now. I noticed that there are some differences between men that get it with women and men that don\u2019t. there are a few differences between them, and one of the most important differences is that men that are good with women, they touch women early on and often. I\u2019m not saying your issue will be gone after my answer now, but I do hope that this was enough to make you think, maybe to even have chocked you a bit. I encourage you to take this and at least think about what I said. Even better, here\u2019s an action tip: Next time you talk to a woman and you are making a point, just touch her under arm when you are making your point. Do this during the 10 next discussions with both men and women, so you get used to it.

Social touching is acceptable \"immediately\".\nIn fact, the faster you start, the more natural it will look to woman and the more natural it will feel to you too. \nFor example, when you go on a date, you could start the social touching immediately by giving her a kiss on the cheek, then when you enter the venue or cross a street, you could put your hand on her lower back. When you are sitting talking, then make a point by touching her under arm. Etc. just like I write in the article. The faster you start, the faster she gets comfortable with you touching her. plus, when you touch her immediately she\u2019ll see you as person who just touches people.

As our memories are strongly affected by emotions, by touching someone, you stir those good feelings and make that interaction better and memorable.\n\nAs mentioned, it should be done as naturally as you can.

I have never done that and have never seen any person near my age do that to someone they arent together with. \n\nKissing on the cheek is seen more in the seductive/sensual category (depends). Its close, its an inch or two to the lips, which by my experience is quite a strong line to cross. You're smelling each other, you're even actually tasting them, so to say.

", "id": "d7rj241"}, {"comment": "Yeah, basically.", "id": "d7rjap4"}, {"comment": "Ok, thanks for clarifying. \nHere are 3 ways to create more mystery (but they are not limited to this).\n1)\tFocus the conversation on her. First of all people like conversations to be about them, and second the more she talks about herself, the less you talk about you. And so the less she knows the more mysterious you are. If combined with her talking a lot, the mystery will be increased because she\u2019ll think (invest) more in you after your gone. She\u2019ll think:  \u201cI know so little about him, and he knows so much about me. Why did I reveal so much of myself to this mysterious stranger? Is there something special going on here? I normally never do this\u201d.  You see this \u201ckind\u201d of thinking will probably happen and her mind will basically do most of the hard work for you.\n2)\t If she asks you a question, be genuine and authentic in your answer, but don\u2019t be complete. Let\u2019s say for example you are a lawyer. And she asks you what you do for a living, you could say \u201cI help people to get what they are entitled to\u201d. See you\u2019re telling the truth but you\u2019re not telling everything at once. This will make her more curious and she\u2019ll start asking more questions.\n3)\tYou can also be vague. For example, let\u2019s say your texting with a woman, and you want to end the conversation first. You say that you have to stop texting because you have \u201csomeone\u201d over at your place visiting you. The fact you said \u201csomeone\u201d instead of a buddy will make her think really hard. She\u2019ll wonder if it was another girl.

I'm talking about friends, not strangers.\n\nAs a more introvert person I'm somehow drawn to more extrovert people as friends. There is always place for one really extrovert person in my live at any moment, in my experience. Always very outspoken, assertive, outgoing, a little bit narcissist, likes attention, you know the deal... These relationships had their upsides and downsides. Besides all the fun and the energy, one of the downsides was them constantly testing boundaries. Always trying to establish some sort of power dynamic.\n\nI've lost extroverted friends over this in the past. I guess the friendships ended because they thought they had 'won' somehow, while I didn't gave a fuck about these moves. I was naive. Some people (most of them?) and even friends just walk over you if you let them.\n\nNow there is this really extrovert friend that I'm seeing for a couple of years. He also has the personality to test you and try out boundaries once in a while, getting a little too cocky about himself sometimes. I genuinely like hanging around with him, there are no dull moments, very energetic. So I don't see any reason ending the friendship. But being more aware of power dynamics lately I thought I had to try something different, because I didn't want to let this friendship die like some of them before either.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, there was this thing he said, I don't even know anymore what it was exactly, disrespecting me a little, or whining about something... anyway, I quickly moved my hand to his face and gave him a little bitch slap. Nothing hard, just a light tap to the cheek. He didn't see it coming, didn't expect it, and it immediately put him in a 'calm and submissive state'. I was not raising my voice or anything, I just told him calmly while smiling that he had to watch his words or something. A bit playful, but very effective. There was no pushing back or anything, he instantly turned into a less egoist state of mind. And the rest of the day he acted way more loyal and generous, for a change taking my preferences into account with the choice of music and volume, etc.\n\nNow I'm not advocating to slap your friends anytime they do something you don't like, but I realized it is a good 'tool' to use once in a while. Especially for me as a more introvert person dealing with the complete opposite on that spectrum. A light tap or quick touch somewhere shows them you can get to them.

I live near the gayest neighborhood in my city, and I'm on the skinny side and take a lot of effort to dress well and be put together all the time. Needless to say, I have quite a few experiences being hit on by guys (gotta figure out how to get girls so interested....). Pushy drunk guys who make repeated sexual advances despite my explicit statements of disinterest? Creepy. But there have been a few instances where I was hit on by guys who seemed very nice and normal and friendly, didn't focus on sex at all, and had solid conversations with me even after I told them I was straight.  \n  \nSure, if your situation (or any of the shitty guys I've met) was a hot girl, you wouldn't have been creeped out. Because if you already want to fuck someone, it's much harder for them to creep you out. But not attractive to you (or even the wrong gender entirely) does not automatically = creepy/uncomfortable. Hell, in one case I ended up chatting with some gay guy in a bar for an hour while I waited for my friends to get back to their apartment (I was locked out). He was a nice guy, made the situation completely comfortable and flattered me during a long long dry spell. I told him I was straight but had no moral issue with any sort of gay stuff and if he could get me drunk enough to try anything that's fine by me. Got really really drunk, despite my best mental gymnastics couldn't figure out a way to feel any attraction or see the appeal, so nothing even remotely happened, didn't even get up from the bar to go attempt anything. But even then he wasn't frustrated or pushy and thought the whole thing was hilarious.  \n  \nTL;DR: Creepiness depends on way more than just being disinterested in the person hitting on you.

I've had experiences which were almost entirely physical in nature from the get-go, it's how we framed it, and the girls were game - sometimes women just want a sexual adventure with that nonjudgmental and charming half-stranger. Straight women like men, they like sex with men, and many of them don't always want or expect a relationship out of it - don't let this discourage you from directly approaching women.\n\nEDIT: I used to work catering at weddings.

I live near the gayest neighborhood in my city, and I'm on the skinny side and take a lot of effort to dress well and be put together all the time. Needless to say, I have quite a few experiences being hit on by guys (gotta figure out how to get girls so interested....). Pushy drunk guys who make repeated sexual advances despite my explicit statements of disinterest? Creepy. But there have been a few instances where I was hit on by guys who seemed very nice and normal and friendly, didn't focus on sex at all, and had solid conversations with me even after I told them I was straight.  \n  \nSure, if your situation (or any of the shitty guys I've met) was a hot girl, you wouldn't have been creeped out. Because if you already want to fuck someone, it's much harder for them to creep you out. But not attractive to you (or even the wrong gender entirely) does not automatically = creepy/uncomfortable. Hell, in one case I ended up chatting with some gay guy in a bar for an hour while I waited for my friends to get back to their apartment (I was locked out). He was a nice guy, made the situation completely comfortable and flattered me during a long long dry spell. I told him I was straight but had no moral issue with any sort of gay stuff and if he could get me drunk enough to try anything that's fine by me. Got really really drunk, despite my best mental gymnastics couldn't figure out a way to feel any attraction or see the appeal, so nothing even remotely happened, didn't even get up from the bar to go attempt anything. But even then he wasn't frustrated or pushy and thought the whole thing was hilarious.  \n  \nTL;DR: Creepiness depends on way more than just being disinterested in the person hitting on you.

Let's say someone just shared that they studied hard and got an A on a test and just so happy about it. You ask a quick question or two to get the full picture (you want more clues on what their perspective actually is) -- was it a particularly hard teacher/subject?

You now have a shared experience, a mutual understanding. That's so much more than asking more and more and more questions without contributing any substance of who you are at all. Alternatively, you could at least give off some sort of opinion about what they told you, something that says you aren't just asking questions but also listening to the answers. An example could be instead of asking if it was a hard class versus a hard teacher, just instantly assert that hard teachers (or hard classes) are the worst and something proud to beat [choose one or the other, make assumptions *make assumptions please* -- have opinions and make assumptions to be interesting]. If you were correct in reading the situation, that's again a shared \"i understand you\" situation that will result in a small spark of excitement and more sharing/relating.

Making someone upset does not increase your chances of having sex with them.  No one here debates that.

Most guys who struggle with women already respect them, its easy to respect someone, but the bigger challenge is to develop confidence and social skills.

Let me know your estimates.\n\nCheck out r/niceguys and r/creepypms\n\n>Because you have experience with relationships that involve both genders. Most struggling guys only have experience with relationships with other men and therefore its their only relationship experience.\n\nI'm not sure if it was you I was talking to when I explained autism + social anxiety = no fucking social skills for me. ADHD made that worse. Now I have AvPD and BPD which develop during adolescence. I have schizoaffective disorder, which fucks with how I perceive and relate to others. *I had no social skills. I had so few social skills I wasn't aware I had no social skills.* I especially didn't have any social skills when it came to boys. Fortunately years and years of work fixed that. I doubt every single man who's struggling talking to women has one or a plethora of disorders that just absolutely prevents him from picking up social skills. (Although many tend to have social anxiety.) It's just very very easy to believe that they reason you're not having success is because women are your opposites and spend all their time playing games, and men are very put-upon and must be pushy and Alpha to get pussy.\n\n>You are somehow interpretting \"are you an innocent girl?\" to mean \"I want to manipulate you and have 0 respect for you!\". Its just a comment to start an interesting convo and the woman can leave any time.\nFrom another comment-\n\n> Also here you go again, using the term manipulative when we already decided that all forms of socializing are manipulative. I only think this definition of manipulation is bad when you 1) waste someone's time, 2) paint false hopes/expectations, 3) lie about yourself, 4) hold someone to a hidden obligation or 5) hurt others. I don't see how \"[Her Name], please tell me you aren't nearly as innocent as you look. Please!\" does any of those.\n> I hoped you'd understand, since I've already acknowledged that all human interaction is manipulation, that the kind of manipulation I'm talking about in negative fashion is negative manipulation.\n> \"[Her Name], please tell me you aren't nearly as innocent as you look. Please!\" functions to catch her off guard and make her defensive- make her feel she has to engage in order to prove in one way or another that she is or isn't innocent. So, I guess 1, 2, 4, and 5 are all applicable here. It asserts an expectation- depending on the girl she'll read it either as an expectation to prove she's 'innocent,' or to prove that she's not. It holds her to the hidden obligation to do so. It's hurtful because it catches her off guard and makes her defensive- it sets up a situation in which he the asker already has the upper hand. It wastes her time because he could just come in with something that wasn't detrimentally manipulative.\n> It's a really small interaction, but it's pretty superficial in terms of dissecting how it operates and why it's bad.\n\n", "id": "d834x20"}, {"comment": "\"It's just very very easy to believe that they reason you're not having success is because women are your opposites and spend all their time playing games, and men are very put-upon and must be pushy and Alpha to get pussy.\"\n\nThat is true.  A struggling man who is lost can come to that conclusion with all the snake oil salesman out there.\n\nBut in this sub, we would recommend him to go out and try to meet people, especially women, so he can gain experience and relationships with women that will prove to him that women are just people too.  Not some evil villain or object.\n\nIf at the point he makes lots of female friends, but none romantic, this sub would encourage him to \"make a move\" which you might interpret as \"being pushy and alpha\" but another girl might view it as \"hes a man who goes for what he wants\".\n\nAgain, you can't please everyone and you are bound to create some awkwardness if you make a move and it gets rejected.

Thanks for including my post in this post. I would love to add a few things to this post to help develop inner game that have worked for me and other guys that I know and students of mine.\n\n1) Get a mentor. A male mentor or mentors who are successful in whatever it is that you want to master be it pickup, business, etc. When you have a mentor your goals become more real because you get to be around a person who is  already accomplishing what you want to achieve. You also get to see what it takes to become successful by observing their actions.\n\n2) Write down your goals EVERYDAY. Not just your pickup goals but goals from every part of your life i.e. fitness, business, money, etc. \n\n3) Record Your Approaches And Break Them Down. When you record yourself via audio or video you get to see yourself from an unbiased prospective. You can't lie to yourself about where you are and you get to see your progress as you continue to record yourself. Also get a coach if you don't know how to break down your video or audio.\n\n4) Take an improv comedy class. I recommend this so highly. Not only will this make your funny but it will make you a better listener, force you to be present and give you stage presence. Your confidence will go up 10 fold. I guarantee it! \n\n5) Read everyday. This is key. You must feed your mind with positive information on a daily basis. The books I recommend for inner game are The Way Of The Superior Man By David Deida and Hold Onto Your Nuts By Wayne Levine. For business success the books I recommend are 10X Rule By Grant Cardone  and Millionaire Fastlane By MJ DeMarco. For self help the book I highly recommend you read The 15 Invaluable Laws Of Growth By John Maxwell. You can also get the audio version of those books on audible. If you want to launch an online business the best program I have came across is Ramit Sethi's Zero to Launch Program. It cost 2K but you can go on Pirate's Bay and download it for free. I used this program to launch my business, it is legit. \n\n6) Establish stronger boundaries. Most of inner game issues come from the inability to say NO and hear NO. When a guy takes rejection personal all it means is that his boundaries are weak and also when a woman makes a request and you want to say NO but you say yes that means your boundaries are weak. The best books I have read to help solve this issue is called, 7 Easy Ways to Say No to Difficult People by Stephanie Sterner and Setting Boundaries With Difficult People By  David J. Lieberman. \n\n7) Exercise and Diet. When you work out and eat clean the benefits that it will have on your mood and outlook on life are huge! You will think clearer, have more energy and be more positive. I recommend working out 3 to 5 times a week and if you can afford it get a personal trainer. For diet I recommend doing a MOSTLY plant based diet while only eating meat 2 or 3 times a week. Watch the documentary Forks Over Knives, eye opening shit. \n\n8) Meditate. Meditation is legit. It teaches you to calm your mind and be present and in the moment. It will help you will infield and when a woman is giving you shit test. The meditation that I use and recommend is called Headspace.\n\nBonus Inner Game Developing Activities.\n1) Self Defense. When you learn how to defend yourself your confidence will increase knowing that you can beat most people's ass if you were ever attacked. You use this to protect yourself not to go around and bully people. If you go around bullying people you are bound to get shot or stabbed. With that being said I highly recommend you learn Muy Thai for 6 months and Brazilian brazilian jiu jitsu for 6 months. You will get down the basics which is all you need to learn unless you want to become a master in them. Just to learn to protect yourself that is all you need.\n\n2) Yoga. I know some of you guys are laughing but I had this girl I picked up introduce me to Yoga and I'm very grateful she did. Yoga is damn hard but it will make you mentally and physically stronger. The discipline and persistence you must develop to get good at yoga is like no other, in all honesty it takes as much if not more discipline and persistence to get good at Yoga as it does Game.

I needed it. "], [17, "> I have been doing stand up comedy for 6 years now and I have run into a lot of people that should quit because they just are not good enough and never will be. These people are depressed and miserable because they have this image in their head of what their life should be, and fail to recognize that happiness is a day to day thing and even if you do \u201cmake it\u201d you will find some other reason to be unhappy.\n\nI liked a lot of the post, but this part tends to invalidate some of what you said, at least.  Just consider that's my observation, and this time I don't need so many down-votes.  Because when you are trying to reach an audience of depressed guys who believe they're losers who can't get women.. introducing a \"determinist\" thought negates a bit of what you say.\n\nFor example, I could easily use that reasoning to continue my rationalizing of the \"ForeverAlone\" belief system.  I could say \"Realistically, I'm in my 30s, somewhat autistic, have no achievements, no career, no social network\" = \"I'll never be good enough for women no matter what, so what I'm left with is ForeverAlone.. the most realistic path for a guy like me.\"\n\nThat said, there are a lot of good things in your post.

Happiness shouldn't come from others, it should come from your attitude towards life. \n\nBut I guess /r/seduction is probably full of depressed guys, so the target audience is pretty self-explanatory.\n\nProps to your website btw.

Depression comes from a rapid reuptake of other neurotransmitters (such as serotonin, dopamine d1-d7, etc.), or from a faulty reuptake system which releases too much serotonin for instance which then leads to none being left for the brain to use, leading to a deficit in serotonin and other neurotransmitters which leads to depression.

This is why I mentioned autistic guys.\n\nEssentially, what I said is improving status to an \"acceptable degree\" is not realistic for some guys.  I felt that your posts weighed very heavily on the \"status\" angle, nothing wrong with that if your only intended audience is your average, social, modern man.. but a lot of guys--particularly guys reading about seduction online--don't have that same equipment.\n\nSo, let's not count these guys out, just because they can't climb the status ladder.

I just wanted to add some of my insights since I've struggled with these issues myself.\n\nThe fundamental reason so many guys struggle to be social is that they are too afraid of saying anything that they haven't run a mental risk-analysis on. \"Is this interesting/funny/insightful enough? What are the chances this will offend them? Are they currently receptive to me talking to them? What if they respond x or y? How do I deal with that?\"\n\nOf course, even if your mental checksum approves and you actually manage to blurt something out (usually faster than your lips can move), by that point you are so jacked up on adrenaline, your body language will reveal your unusually high level of investment in your comment about canned tuna, and you will come across as fake/awkward and ruin any chance of engaging the listener. Then you take this negative response to mean that your mental risk-analysis isn't good enough, become even more cautious, and spend more energy on thinking through more permutations the next time. It's fucking exhausting and it doesn't work.\n\nStop. That. Shit. Unless you're in an important interview or pleading to a judge, put an end to that habit IMMEDIATELY.\n\nThose fun/happy/confident social guys you watch enviously as they pick up all the women in the bar, weren't born with any gift that you don't have. They are like that because they give less of a fuck about saying the right thing than you do. These guys constantly say the stupidest, most offensive shit. And no matter what they say, women will almost always be receptive to them because their body language, confidence, eye contact, presence, and lack of a useless risk-analysis system is doing all the talking for them.\n\nStop thinking. You see a person, spend a split second making an observation about something they're doing/wearing/eating, and just say it. That's it. I swear to you, if you start doing this daily and make it a habit to live by, it will completely change your social life and turn you into a person you never thought you could be. You're going to say stupid shit, you're going to offend people, you're going to feel bad, it's going to be uncomfortable, but holy hell it's going to be worth it."], [20, "Amazing tips here.

I just wanted to add some of my insights since I've struggled with these issues myself.\n\nThe fundamental reason so many guys struggle to be social is that they are too afraid of saying anything that they haven't run a mental risk-analysis on. \"Is this interesting/funny/insightful enough? What are the chances this will offend them? Are they currently receptive to me talking to them? What if they respond x or y? How do I deal with that?\"\n\nOf course, even if your mental checksum approves and you actually manage to blurt something out (usually faster than your lips can move), by that point you are so jacked up on adrenaline, your body language will reveal your unusually high level of investment in your comment about canned tuna, and you will come across as fake/awkward and ruin any chance of engaging the listener. Then you take this negative response to mean that your mental risk-analysis isn't good enough, become even more cautious, and spend more energy on thinking through more permutations the next time. It's fucking exhausting and it doesn't work.\n\nStop. That. Shit. Unless you're in an important interview or pleading to a judge, put an end to that habit IMMEDIATELY.\n\nThose fun/happy/confident social guys you watch enviously as they pick up all the women in the bar, weren't born with any gift that you don't have. They are like that because they give less of a fuck about saying the right thing than you do. These guys constantly say the stupidest, most offensive shit. And no matter what they say, women will almost always be receptive to them because their body language, confidence, eye contact, presence, and lack of a useless risk-analysis system is doing all the talking for them.\n\nStop thinking. You see a person, spend a split second making an observation about something they're doing/wearing/eating, and just say it. That's it. I swear to you, if you start doing this daily and make it a habit to live by, it will completely change your social life and turn you into a person you never thought you could be.

It wasn't until a few days before Valentine's day 2012, that I randomly decided to check out Reddit. I didn't know what to do, so I decided to click 'Random'. A few clicks later, I stumbled upon /r/seduction.\n\nThe titles of the posts captured my attention. The first post I read on /r/seduction was probably an FR of somebody getting laid. I had entered college with high hopes. I ended up getting too caught up with school work, that I had no friends in my first semester. It made me really upset. Reading the FR of somebody getting laid, gave me hope. I went to the Top Posts of All Time in /r/seduction, and I feasted on all the crazy FRs(k-closes, #-closes, f-closes) of the time. I thought this stuff was amazing. Before that I thought successes were much more rare. Reading them prove to me that it was possible and that I could be successful too.\n\nThe one post that changed everything for me was by one of the former moderators, TofuTofu. He deleted all his FRs a while ago. Here is an insufficient outline of his FR. Its insufficient because unfortunately I can't remember all the details.\n> TofuTofu went to Santacon 2011 in NYC with a group of like 5-7 girls. He goes with girl A to her apt b/c she needs to pickup something. He plows her. They rejoin the group, sometime later girl A leaves. He somehow pulls away girl B to her apt and plows her, too. The same stuff happens and he ends up plowing girl C. He had a pretty good day. In his FR, he stated this as the 'kicker': that he didn't even once wash his dick.\n\nReading a post like that pretty much made him a legend in my eyes.\n\nSo, how did /r/seduction actually change my life? Not immediately, that's for sure. I still don't even workout, though I'm considered skinny and somewhat athletic. By reading FRs and seeing how all kinds of people can be successful, I began to believe that I could too. From the repeated phrases by sedditors, it was drilled into my head that:\n\n* It's a number's game. Success often involved a fair amount of luck. You could, however, better position yourself for opportunities.\n* \n\nNow, back to the idea that Game is a numbers game and involved luck. I decided to buy a ticket to a school dance, even though I would be going alone, without friends because I did not really have friends. The day before the dance, I was at an event (again, me positioning myself for opportunities) and I decided to sit near some people who I kind of knew (again, opportunities). Well, at the end of the event, one girl asked if I was going to the dance and invited me to go with her and her friends who I have never met. I agreed, we exchanged numbers, and the next day I met up with like ~10 people who knew each other already. It was quite a big step out of my comfort zone. On the way to the dance, I was being pretty quiet, and I noticed a girl being quiet, too, so I decided to talk to her. We ended up clicking and continued talking for the 4~5 hours.\n\nWe didn't even dance, and thank god because I was, and still kind of am (but not afraid now), a bad dancer back then. So, me, the girl, and her friends, walked back to her friends dorms, and then her and I decided we were hungry, so we split up to get some pizza. I had no cash since I was afraid I'd lose my wallet at the dance. She ended up paying, lol. A few moments later, and we're at her dorm in her bed, watching Netflix with my arm around her. (I invented Netflix and Chill, I **swear**.) I ended up not closing, out of choice, which I really regret. Anyways, I got a #-close and an h-close (hug-close), haha. I left her dorm at like 4am. For me, it just felt too uncomfortable to cuddle her to sleep (the warmth of it all).\n\nI ended up not going any further with her the next few times we met up, but again, that was because of my own choice (so horrible, I regret it to this day). I felt like a king and I did try to become the better person I wanted to be.\n\nI believe the biggest step in the whole process was for me to address my own shortcomings. I am a bad dancer, so the next year, I joined a swing dance club. I only went to a few beginners lessons, but the point is that I tried and I did become more comfortable with dancing in general. Slowly, through the past years, I have bettered myself, and I keep trying to better myself.\n\nBack 4-5 years ago, *The Game* was the most recommended book on this subreddit. About a year later, *Models* had become the new PUA bible to read. I never bothered reading them until Summer 2014. *The Game* teaches you Pick-Up industry history and how you need a wide variety of techniques and an open mindset to be successful. *Models* taught me about polarizing, the idea of accepting rejection and filtering out women. Oh, and *Models* also taught me about the whole matching color shoe/belt/watch thing and a few other useful fashion tips.\n\nThe points is, OP, that for the kind of people that are here, they need repeated drilling of basic techniques/mindsets in order to step-up to the challenge. It took me a few years for me to be finally pushed to read 'The Game' and 'Models'. Things take time. And while, I don't find this subreddit to be as appealing as it used to be, I know that it is definitely benefitting the new peeps, which is what it is all about.\n\nThanks /r/seduction."], [2, "I agree.

It wasn't until a few days before Valentine's day 2012, that I randomly decided to check out Reddit. I didn't know what to do, so I decided to click 'Random'. A few clicks later, I stumbled upon /r/seduction.\n\nThe titles of the posts captured my attention. The first post I read on /r/seduction was probably an FR of somebody getting laid. I had entered college with high hopes. I ended up getting too caught up with school work, that I had no friends in my first semester. It made me really upset. Reading the FR of somebody getting laid, gave me hope. I went to the Top Posts of All Time in /r/seduction, and I feasted on all the crazy FRs(k-closes, #-closes, f-closes) of the time. I thought this stuff was amazing. Before that I thought successes were much more rare. Reading them prove to me that it was possible and that I could be successful too.\n\nThe one post that changed everything for me was by one of the former moderators, TofuTofu. He deleted all his FRs a while ago. Here is an insufficient outline of his FR. Its insufficient because unfortunately I can't remember all the details.\n> TofuTofu went to Santacon 2011 in NYC with a group of like 5-7 girls. He goes with girl A to her apt b/c she needs to pickup something. He plows her. They rejoin the group, sometime later girl A leaves. He somehow pulls away girl B to her apt and plows her, too. The same stuff happens and he ends up plowing girl C. He had a pretty good day. In his FR, he stated this as the 'kicker': that he didn't even once wash his dick.\n\nReading a post like that pretty much made him a legend in my eyes.\n\nSo, how did /r/seduction actually change my life? Not immediately, that's for sure. I still don't even workout, though I'm considered skinny and somewhat athletic. By reading FRs and seeing how all kinds of people can be successful, I began to believe that I could too. From the repeated phrases by sedditors, it was drilled into my head that:\n\n* It's a number's game. Success often involved a fair amount of luck. You could, however, better position yourself for opportunities.\n* \n\nNow, back to the idea that Game is a numbers game and involved luck. I decided to buy a ticket to a school dance, even though I would be going alone, without friends because I did not really have friends. The day before the dance, I was at an event (again, me positioning myself for opportunities) and I decided to sit near some people who I kind of knew (again, opportunities). Well, at the end of the event, one girl asked if I was going to the dance and invited me to go with her and her friends who I have never met. I agreed, we exchanged numbers, and the next day I met up with like ~10 people who knew each other already. It was quite a big step out of my comfort zone. On the way to the dance, I was being pretty quiet, and I noticed a girl being quiet, too, so I decided to talk to her. We ended up clicking and continued talking for the 4~5 hours.\n\nWe didn't even dance, and thank god because I was, and still kind of am (but not afraid now), a bad dancer back then. So, me, the girl, and her friends, walked back to her friends dorms, and then her and I decided we were hungry, so we split up to get some pizza. I had no cash since I was afraid I'd lose my wallet at the dance. She ended up paying, lol. A few moments later, and we're at her dorm in her bed, watching Netflix with my arm around her. (I invented Netflix and Chill, I **swear**.) I ended up not closing, out of choice, which I really regret. Anyways, I got a #-close and an h-close (hug-close), haha. I left her dorm at like 4am. For me, it just felt too uncomfortable to cuddle her to sleep (the warmth of it all).\n\nI ended up not going any further with her the next few times we met up, but again, that was because of my own choice (so horrible, I regret it to this day). I felt like a king and I did try to become the better person I wanted to be.\n\nI believe the biggest step in the whole process was for me to address my own shortcomings. I am a bad dancer, so the next year, I joined a swing dance club. I only went to a few beginners lessons, but the point is that I tried and I did become more comfortable with dancing in general. Slowly, through the past years, I have bettered myself, and I keep trying to better myself.\n\nBack 4-5 years ago, *The Game* was the most recommended book on this subreddit. About a year later, *Models* had become the new PUA bible to read. I never bothered reading them until Summer 2014. *The Game* teaches you Pick-Up industry history and how you need a wide variety of techniques and an open mindset to be successful. *Models* taught me about polarizing, the idea of accepting rejection and filtering out women. Oh, and *Models* also taught me about the whole matching color shoe/belt/watch thing and a few other useful fashion tips.\n\nThe points is, OP, that for the kind of people that are here, they need repeated drilling of basic techniques/mindsets in order to step-up to the challenge. It took me a few years for me to be finally pushed to read 'The Game' and 'Models'. Things take time. And while, I don't find this subreddit to be as appealing as it used to be, I know that it is definitely benefitting the new peeps, which is what it is all about.\n\nThanks /r/seduction.", "id": "d2kr0tx"}, {"comment": "I agree.

Perhaps should just post as another thread but since I consider topic relevant, I'll just post here.\n\nFirst things first, I've been on a drought for quite some time. Over a year I think. Just make out sessions time from time but always failing to close in but that's not what I want to talk about, I'm getting there. Just mentioning this because it might influence my 'problem'.\n\nSo the actual problem is that I've had a girlfriend few years ago and it was my first relationship, but back then I was unaware about many things and was a hypocritic self proclaimed nice guy. Not hard to guess, that she eventually dumped me, because of many reasons..but anyway, the relationship lasted for about 2 years, so that I consider as a lot.\n\nI've changed a lot since then. Instead of looking for one and the only, for love, for the true person for my soul and all that other bullshit (I now can't believe that I used to believe in), I'm now more honest to myself and others and just looking to fuck, while the standards for girls are more realistic as well..\n\nSo with the depiction of change in attitude, I can now move on to the part where the problem arises. Although I've been over the past relationship and moved on and I'm actually really happy to be single...I sometimes catch myself thinking about my ex. \n\nIs this the obsession that you're mentioning of? At least to me, it seems so. She sometimes shows up in my dreams. Could this be influenced by the period of drought? I'm not looking for a relationship, more so to renew the old one, so why the fuck...?\n\nSure, I have this thought that I'd like to meet with her again, especially now that my perception about things is 180 from what it used to be.. But I have a suspicion that it's my brains that are desperate for some sorts of affection and try to withhold at least until I get laid with some other girl.\n\nIt's not that it's bugging me a lot but feels weird sometimes, to say the least. Your thoughts?"], [6, "I used to be obsessive as *fuck* about relationships of all kinds myself, and have some thoughts on this...\n\n* In a macro sense, what you're describing is transitivity: A = B, B = C, therefore A = C. In my own experience it's spot-on when talking about obsessions, and a lot of other emotions people can't quite put into detail. A girl becomes shorthand for intimacy. A breakup becomes shorthand for being alone. Behind the fear of any monster is a fear of what that monster can do to us. Anytime you find yourself asking why you feel a certain way on a surface level, you can probably repeat the question about two or three times with whatever answer you have.\n* Writing also gives you something to reference later as you process things, and lets you lay things out in detail. From my own experience, I literally spent a year and a half blogging various disaster stories (mostly prior ones) as I tried to piece together why I couldn't hold stable relationships, but as I went they not only served as pieces of a puzzle but also became before pictures of sorts. Tracking progress like that gives you a certain perspective, both in terms of how far you've come and where you need to go next.\n* For the ones still stuck in this: finding a decent distraction is important - preferably something else you can obsess over. (Crucially, note the pronoun. Some*thing*, not some*one* -- otherwise, the whole thing just repeats.) What *doesn't* work is just trying to force the girl in question out of your head, as thoughts actually have a way of becoming more prominent as you actively try to get rid of them. Psych people know this as [ironic process theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory), and the Internet knows it as [the game](http://losethegame.com/).  Instead of trying and failing to brute-force it, dive into something else: an instrument, or the gym, or even a game. (I know personal growth should be the aim here, but personally I have to admit /r/smashbros has been of great help to me in this regard.) You can use that same mindset to aim at growth (of whatever sort) rather than just suffering from it. Obsess over progress.\n* Forgetting about her isn't the point. Rebuilding bridges isn't the point. Ceasing to give a fuck is (To you, OP: congratulations on accomplishing this.) Even if you can literally forget that she exists, what happens if something reminds you of her? You're back at square one. What happens if, by some miracle, you get together again? You're still obsessed with her, and that makes a lot of relationships fall apart. Your ultimate goal is to be better, and further iterations of the same loop or a case of selective memory won't be what makes that happen.\n* To repeat some of what I said about transitivity: always ask why, and always ask how. Seriously fucking *contemplate* how you react to things and to people, and what leads you to react in a given way. In depth. Dig into things you're not comfortable acknowledging. Have honest conversations about them, with people that you trust and whose input and perspectives you value. (Presuming you have those. I've done the loner thing too, so no judgment if you don't.

Perhaps should just post as another thread but since I consider topic relevant, I'll just post here.\n\nFirst things first, I've been on a drought for quite some time. Over a year I think. Just make out sessions time from time but always failing to close in but that's not what I want to talk about, I'm getting there. Just mentioning this because it might influence my 'problem'.\n\nSo the actual problem is that I've had a girlfriend few years ago and it was my first relationship, but back then I was unaware about many things and was a hypocritic self proclaimed nice guy. Not hard to guess, that she eventually dumped me, because of many reasons..but anyway, the relationship lasted for about 2 years, so that I consider as a lot.\n\nI've changed a lot since then. Instead of looking for one and the only, for love, for the true person for my soul and all that other bullshit (I now can't believe that I used to believe in), I'm now more honest to myself and others and just looking to fuck, while the standards for girls are more realistic as well..\n\nSo with the depiction of change in attitude, I can now move on to the part where the problem arises. Although I've been over the past relationship and moved on and I'm actually really happy to be single...I sometimes catch myself thinking about my ex. \n\nIs this the obsession that you're mentioning of? At least to me, it seems so. She sometimes shows up in my dreams. Could this be influenced by the period of drought? I'm not looking for a relationship, more so to renew the old one, so why the fuck...?\n\nSure, I have this thought that I'd like to meet with her again, especially now that my perception about things is 180 from what it used to be.. But I have a suspicion that it's my brains that are desperate for some sorts of affection and try to withhold at least until I get laid with some other girl.\n\nIt's not that it's bugging me a lot but feels weird sometimes, to say the least.

I've found that, as men, avoiding that with friends and family makes us force ourselves into shitty relationships to get it. To avoid that scenario, it's time to open up to someone close more and/or fill your head with a new passion you are obsessed with.\n\nI wouldn't reconnect with a girl if she was in my dreams.

Heck, I'm probably panicky afraid of getting into a relationship right now. But not because I'm afraid of intimacy, I just value time and money a lot right now and relationship is like black hole to those.\n\nBut maybe I'm just being superficial right now.

In my own experience it's spot-on when talking about obsessions, and a lot of other emotions people can't quite put into detail. A girl becomes shorthand for intimacy. A breakup becomes shorthand for being alone. Behind the fear of any monster is a fear of what that monster can do to us. Anytime you find yourself asking why you feel a certain way on a surface level, you can probably repeat the question about two or three times with whatever answer you have.\n* Writing also gives you something to reference later as you process things, and lets you lay things out in detail. From my own experience, I literally spent a year and a half blogging various disaster stories (mostly prior ones) as I tried to piece together why I couldn't hold stable relationships, but as I went they not only served as pieces of a puzzle but also became before pictures of sorts. Tracking progress like that gives you a certain perspective, both in terms of how far you've come and where you need to go next.\n* For the ones still stuck in this: finding a decent distraction is important - preferably something else you can obsess over. (Crucially, note the pronoun. Some*thing*, not some*one* -- otherwise, the whole thing just repeats.) What *doesn't* work is just trying to force the girl in question out of your head, as thoughts actually have a way of becoming more prominent as you actively try to get rid of them. Psych people know this as [ironic process theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory), and the Internet knows it as [the game](http://losethegame.com/).  Instead of trying and failing to brute-force it, dive into something else: an instrument, or the gym, or even a game. (I know personal growth should be the aim here, but personally I have to admit /r/smashbros has been of great help to me in this regard.) You can use that same mindset to aim at growth (of whatever sort) rather than just suffering from it. Obsess over progress.\n* Forgetting about her isn't the point. Rebuilding bridges isn't the point. Ceasing to give a fuck is (To you, OP: congratulations on accomplishing this.) Even if you can literally forget that she exists, what happens if something reminds you of her? You're back at square one. What happens if, by some miracle, you get together again? You're still obsessed with her, and that makes a lot of relationships fall apart. Your ultimate goal is to be better, and further iterations of the same loop or a case of selective memory won't be what makes that happen.\n* To repeat some of what I said about transitivity: always ask why, and always ask how. Seriously fucking *contemplate* how you react to things and to people, and what leads you to react in a given way. In depth. Dig into things you're not comfortable acknowledging. Have honest conversations about them, with people that you trust and whose input and perspectives you value. (Presuming you have those. I've done the loner thing too, so no judgment if you don't.

But dancing in general has helped me sharpen my social skills to a razor point and I've earned a wealth of knowledge about how to act and touch women as a result. My confidence is higher and I attract women from other areas of my life so I highly recommend learning to dance.\n\nTo echo what someone said above: *DO NOT* swing dance or blues dance to meet women. Do it to improve your social skills, learn a fun new hobby, and make more friends. If you keep those thoughts in mind the women will be chasing *you* in other areas of your life. Dancing will make you more confident, build your social circle, and thus give you life experiences that women will find attractive and they will be drawn to you as a result.\n\nLearning a skill like dancing does wonders for your inner game. Trust me. "], [11, "Just 2 anecdotal points. I've been dancing for the majority of my life (currently on one of my school's best competitive hip hop teams) which sounds really lame but whatever.\n\nFirst anecdote: I took a ballroom course one quarter to meet a unit requirement. The class was fucking huge and maybe like 2% of the girls were hot. This is disproportionate to the campus as a whole. It was like a needle in a hay stack type deal so if you are expecting to be surrounded by hot single women immediately then think again. \n\nSecond anecdote: there is always at least 1, usually more than one, creepy dude who is there to specifically hit on/touch girls. You can spot these mother fuckers from a mile away and the vibe around them is just awful. Girls pick up on this shit immediately too. Barring the creepy dudes, there's always at least one or two awkward dudes who will awkwardly ask for numbers and shit and crash and burn spectacularly. If you dance with a girl or meet someone there and there's chemistry and it goes well then that is great. However, if you try and force it and it's obvious that you're there for girls and you don't give a fuck about dancing then you will crash and burn like the other dudes there. \n\nPersonal advice: ballroom is cool and all but I would suggest going to a studio or workshop and picking up hip hop classes. Why?  In general, the majority of girls at studio are actually hot or at least attractive. Additionally, there is a similarly strong ratio of girls to guys still. It's harder to get into a social circle (no forced interactions) but when you do it's more fulfilling in my opinion. This is my own bias but I think the quality of girls at studios is higher, not only in terms of attractiveness but personality as well. I just get along better with girls with a \"cool\" persona than the, for lack of a better word, quirky nature of the typical girl you'll find at beginner ballroom. Some of my best friendships/relationships have come from girls that I've met at the studio or in the more advanced dance community. Additionally, I think having hip hop experience, like knowing how to groove, is more suited to dancing at clubs and parties than ballroom and thus may be a higher value skill to pursue.\n\nIn any case, if you go to any dance class, even if you are there just to hit on girls, make sure that you telegraph an interest in dance so that you aren't pegged as the creepy dude.

I've been dancing for the majority of my life (currently on one of my school's best competitive hip hop teams) which sounds really lame but whatever.\n\nFirst anecdote: I took a ballroom course one quarter to meet a unit requirement. The class was fucking huge and maybe like 2% of the girls were hot. This is disproportionate to the campus as a whole. It was like a needle in a hay stack type deal so if you are expecting to be surrounded by hot single women immediately then think again. \n\nSecond anecdote: there is always at least 1, usually more than one, creepy dude who is there to specifically hit on/touch girls. You can spot these mother fuckers from a mile away and the vibe around them is just awful. Girls pick up on this shit immediately too. Barring the creepy dudes, there's always at least one or two awkward dudes who will awkwardly ask for numbers and shit and crash and burn spectacularly. If you dance with a girl or meet someone there and there's chemistry and it goes well then that is great. However, if you try and force it and it's obvious that you're there for girls and you don't give a fuck about dancing then you will crash and burn like the other dudes there. \n\nPersonal advice: ballroom is cool and all but I would suggest going to a studio or workshop and picking up hip hop classes. Why?  In general, the majority of girls at studio are actually hot or at least attractive. Additionally, there is a similarly strong ratio of girls to guys still. It's harder to get into a social circle (no forced interactions) but when you do it's more fulfilling in my opinion. This is my own bias but I think the quality of girls at studios is higher, not only in terms of attractiveness but personality as well. I just get along better with girls with a \"cool\" persona than the, for lack of a better word, quirky nature of the typical girl you'll find at beginner ballroom. Some of my best friendships/relationships have come from girls that I've met at the studio or in the more advanced dance community. Additionally, I think having hip hop experience, like knowing how to groove, is more suited to dancing at clubs and parties than ballroom and thus may be a higher value skill to pursue.\n\nIn any case, if you go to any dance class, even if you are there just to hit on girls, make sure that you telegraph an interest in dance so that you aren't pegged as the creepy dude.

Don't play a numbers game at least openly (talking to and trying to hit on as many girls as possible etc.).  Have general interactions with girls.  Keep your tone fun.  An easy opener is something like \"hey, just making sure, this is so and so's class right?\" then gauge your next moves off of response.  If girl is just like yeah and ignores you then don't press.  If girl is like \"Ya it is, I'm so excited/he's pretty dope/whatever\" then push like \"Oh, okay cool just making sure.  This is my first time so I wasn't really sure.\" delivered smiling with maybe a confident laugh but in any case deliver it with confidence.  Personally, I think there's an art to making it known that you are in a relatively uncomfortable situation for you but you are handling it like a champ and having fun with it as opposed to just being uncomfortable.  There is a certain confidence required to be confident in yourself in a situation where you are not actually confident, if that makes any sense.  Showing that vulnerability but making it something that is not a true vulnerability is a strength.  Girl might then follow with something like, \"Oh wow really? Yeah it should be tons of fun then!\" (Dancing is meant to be fun by itself) then you respond \"Ya I'm excited to do it. I'm guessing that you dance often? You must be pretty sick then\" and if she's like yeah you can follow with how long have you been dancing etc etc.  During class or right before you can follow up with something like \"Hey, is it cool if I dance by you?  I need someone to follow haha\" or \"Wow I don't know this choreo at all, I'm counting on you to follow so don't fuck up\" but delivered playfully.  You're asking a favor/giving value which is a good thing in this situation but you're also bringing her into this fake stressful situation of both of you trying your best to get through the dance when you both don't really know it (she'll respond with something along the lines of \"oh no I don't know it either\" because this is what all dancers do) which brings you into a situation together which automatically builds report/feelings of togetherness between you and her.  \n\nSo, in short, you put yourself out there a little bit making it known you're a newb.  Bring her into your world/make small talk if she's open to it.  Focus on building something of a relationship with one girl, not all of them.  Afterwards, be like \"Hey, it was great meeting you whatever\" if it went well you can try and pull a number with the pretext of dancing together in the future or wanting to know more about dance or the local scene etc.  However, this move is best saved until you've seen her in class a few times/have hung out after class (a lot of dancers kick it at the studio between classes chilling with other dancers).  Most dancers, if they like the class, will go to it weekly at the same studio if not more classes at that studio so it's pretty easy to run into the same people over and over.

Because, understanding attraction can helpful to being good at employing it (mind you, I am aware that theory and practice, especially in this field, are chasms across one another at times. But I've also noticed that once you're good at it, it all becomes so obvious).\n\nIn my own personal experiences:\n\nWhat *makes* *up* \"attraction\" is pretty universal. The good looks, a job, some mental stability... these are all things we would all judge the same on a bell curve. But the importance we give each of these bell curves - whether we care more about her hair color, amount of pubic hair, personality, or how good she can cook - that differs from person to person. So a \"10\" on looks can easily be mutually agreed upon.

Things got complicated where she felt unsure about her choice of rejecting me and expressed her desire to date me, but kept me as a friend. To make matters worse, a few days after I confessed, she entered into a LDR with some guy she met over Facebook. She told me multiple times that she didn't love the guy, in order to keep me around. Being the fool I was, I believed her and stayed being her friend. This went on for a while, but there were lots of arguments, anger, resentment, and guilt between my best friend and I. It hurt a lot and I decided not to let myself go through with it because it was bringing me down mentally and emotionally. I realized that I deserved better and ended our friendship.

My name is ItalianStallion. I went through a transformation process, like you did my good man. It's fucking great, but it's also fucking amazing when you start to learn the game my friends. My techniques, called the PrideStallion 90% of the time work. \n\nRule one: You must humiliate your-self in public, then can you only understand the perception of people. You must learn to see your self worth, how much you are worth. Rule number one is the most important, I want you to break your former self, shatter it, I want you to be shocked and see the world for what it is worth. Once you see that it doesnt matter what anyone thinks of you, you start to become a cloud over water, fearless, as the great alan watts said. You become one with your mind, you no longer hesitate because you have internally broken through to the other side, something most people would not understand. \n\nRule 2: You must have a sense of self worth/hygiene - this entails men, Polo Blue cologne, two spritz on each side of the neck, deodorant, clean teach, trimmed facial hair and nice hair cut or no hair at all. I would say something about clothes, but it doesnt matter, once you follow rule 1 and 2, it really doesn't matter what you look like, as long as your confident, clean looking and witty, you're getting a number.\n\nRule 3: Developed by the great Mystery him-self- Peacock Theory: Wear one article of anything to make you stand out. Listen lads, it can be a bracelet that your nan gave you, a yellow watch, an interesting necklace. You need to do what every other guy IS NOT DOING, you must be unique, a subtle unique. You want her to see right off the bat, with your swagger of confidence and peacock item, but you don't mention until she does, she will, trust me, when she becomes interested, she starts to visually explore you, she starts to size you up, it's evolution. \n\nRule 4: (beginners to intermediates getting into the game) My young apprentices, welcome to the dark side. I, your master, need apprentices. Like Darth Vader had a secret apprentice, you need a fellow lad with you to challenge and correct. Someone to get criticism from, a different eye of opinion. You may never have more than 2 apprenctices and never less than one. The rule of three is sacred. Together, your apprentices and yourself will take flight on a scared path of life, a bond must be formed, someone to trust as a wingman. This is almost more important than rule 1. \n\nPeace and Love \nItalian Stallion \np.s. I will be making more threads soon, I have to get my score up more to become more legit\n\"The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.\" - Alan Watts, my mentor "], [1, "Thanks for this post, it inspires me a lot. I had this thing to always wanted to look perfect. But I had acnea so of course, I couldn't be perfect. \n\nIt completely ruins my high school years, where I could have been happy and just enjoy life, I was frustrated, victim of my own life.\n\nNow, I'm suffering from the consequences of that. But now that I know all my nice guy behaviors, I'll change them. For the better.\n\nThanks for this post again. I read it a lot, you have no idea how your life is about to change mine. \n\nAnd hopefully one day, I'll be the one telling my success story."], [1, "hey man i really wanna know what you look like too see if you look above average or something. can you pm me a picture?"], [1, "It's fun. I noticed the same thing when changing my mindset towards a girl I never stopped thinking about. I'm going to class with her, and I always tried to sit next to her and talk to her as much as possible. Then I just stopped. I only hung out with her when I kinda had to. After that I noticed that she started sending more snapchats to me and just trying to reach out to me more in everyday situations, since I could focus on hanging out with everyone else and thus becoming more popular in my class and pushing boarders in terms on socializing. She actually seems to be developing a slight crush on me, which is almost fun to watch for me. I started talking to everyone else and I started wearing cologne and taking care of my skin (pimple problem - gone). Just amazing how far not really focusing on anyone liking you will actually make people (even the ones you were always trying to please) like you more. I feel different and I connect more with nearly everyone, I'd say, although my transformation hasn't been as obvious as yours have.

It's fucking great, but it's also fucking amazing when you start to learn the game my friends. My techniques, called the PrideStallion 90% of the time work. \n\nRule one: You must humiliate your-self in public, then can you only understand the perception of people. You must learn to see your self worth, how much you are worth. Rule number one is the most important, I want you to break your former self, shatter it, I want you to be shocked and see the world for what it is worth. Once you see that it doesnt matter what anyone thinks of you, you start to become a cloud over water, fearless, as the great alan watts said. You become one with your mind, you no longer hesitate because you have internally broken through to the other side, something most people would not understand. \n\nRule 2: You must have a sense of self worth/hygiene - this entails men, Polo Blue cologne, two spritz on each side of the neck, deodorant, clean teach, trimmed facial hair and nice hair cut or no hair at all. I would say something about clothes, but it doesnt matter, once you follow rule 1 and 2, it really doesn't matter what you look like, as long as your confident, clean looking and witty, you're getting a number.\n\nRule 3: Developed by the great Mystery him-self- Peacock Theory: Wear one article of anything to make you stand out. Listen lads, it can be a bracelet that your nan gave you, a yellow watch, an interesting necklace. You need to do what every other guy IS NOT DOING, you must be unique, a subtle unique. You want her to see right off the bat, with your swagger of confidence and peacock item, but you don't mention until she does, she will, trust me, when she becomes interested, she starts to visually explore you, she starts to size you up, it's evolution. \n\nRule 4: (beginners to intermediates getting into the game) My young apprentices, welcome to the dark side. I, your master, need apprentices. Like Darth Vader had a secret apprentice, you need a fellow lad with you to challenge and correct. Someone to get criticism from, a different eye of opinion. You may never have more than 2 apprenctices and never less than one. The rule of three is sacred. Together, your apprentices and yourself will take flight on a scared path of life, a bond must be formed, someone to trust as a wingman. This is almost more important than rule 1. \n\nPeace and Love \nItalian Stallion \np.s. I will be making more threads soon, I have to get my score up more to become more legit\n\"The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.\" - Alan Watts, my mentor ", "id": "d1vj16i"}], [{"comment": "Thanks for this post, it inspires me a lot.

But now that I know all my nice guy behaviors, I'll change them. For the better.\n\nThanks for this post again.

I noticed the same thing when changing my mindset towards a girl I never stopped thinking about. I'm going to class with her, and I always tried to sit next to her and talk to her as much as possible. Then I just stopped. I only hung out with her when I kinda had to. After that I noticed that she started sending more snapchats to me and just trying to reach out to me more in everyday situations, since I could focus on hanging out with everyone else and thus becoming more popular in my class and pushing boarders in terms on socializing. She actually seems to be developing a slight crush on me, which is almost fun to watch for me. I started talking to everyone else and I started wearing cologne and taking care of my skin (pimple problem - gone). Just amazing how far not really focusing on anyone liking you will actually make people (even the ones you were always trying to please) like you more. I feel different and I connect more with nearly everyone, I'd say, although my transformation hasn't been as obvious as yours have.

The difference is more that men and women are culturally conditioned to express and suppress different emotions, and men are generally encouraged to keep certain emotions hidden, more so than women. That is why, if someone sees a man crying, they are more likely to assume something serious - men are unfortunately pressured into hiding that particular emotion. They might still act on it, but it will not be as obvious to others.

He got rid off his royalty at a young age and instead started to turn to science. He became one of the best geographers of his time and, most importantly, furthered Darwin's theory of evolution. And this is the part where I find great affirmation in, he shows that the notion of us being cold calculating competitors isn't what we're all about.

The human brain is not logical (ahem) *which is why you cannot talk yourself into being confident.* Everyone knows, at the very least, that it feels better to be confident than insecure, so why can't we just say to ourselves \"brain, we would all be better off if you just stopped being insecure and got confident\"? Because it doesn't work that way. Our thoughts, feelings and ways of thinking are all a product of our environment. The only way we can change how \"confident\" we are is to fundamentally change the way that we interact with and fit into our world. \n\n>Without going into too much detail I have lots of first hand experience with just how powerful the brain is and how much it can bend reality.....\n\nAgain, you are arguing against yourself.

You seem to disagree vehemently with this idea. I, on the other hand, agree with OP and try to provide real life examples. Then it all gets confusing. \n\nNow, I do agree that you can't talk yourself into having confidence right off the bat, because the gap between what you're telling yourself and how you perceive the world is too great. However, I do believe that it is possible to talk yourself into changing your reality, or rather your perception of reality, over time.\n\nSince low confidence is the topic at hand here, let's take a look at how you develop bad confidence. Let me first warn you that these are my personal experiences and observations, but they seem to hold true in most cases ...\n\nBad confidence seem to grow out of a handful of negative experiences, and since the human psyche has a built-in tendency to generalize we risk making separate cases into all-encompassing truths. Then we recall the memories of \"that one time ...\" whenever we encounter similar situations, and basically train our brain to feel bad every time we as much as think about whatever caused this in the first place. In psychology this process is called an implicit memory, and it is a kind of learned reflex that in this case makes bad feelings pop up whenever you think about approaching that woman in the bar. Or any woman for that matter. Repeat this over many years, and you have basically talked your brain into overwriting reality with the version you believe is true. \n\nAnother, relatet issue is limiting beliefs, which in many cases is us reacting to something we assume will play out if we do a certain thing. Like the ever popular disaster scenario, where one assume that one will fail miseraby if one approach a girl, and that everyone within earshot will laugh their asses off for years to come. This is of course not true, and in reality you might get a snicker if things bomb really bad, but since you've spent years telling yourself that this is reality, your mind makes it so real you scare yourself out of even trying. So yeah, I do believe that the mind has trouble separating between what is real and what we tell it is real. It's just that it doesn't happen over night.", "id": "d0qw9vv"}, {"comment": "I get what you are saying. I just think that it is a bit overly analytical. \n\nWhat you call implicit memories, limiting beliefs, etc. I just call bad habits. Breaking bad habits is not easy, but it can be done. I think the less time we spend analyzing our bad habits and the more time we spend breaking them, the better results we will see. \n\nI myself was in a similar situation in my late teens/early twenties where I just wanted to analyze and make excuses and delay, delay, delay. It was pure laziness. It's easy to *think* things and so much harder to *do*. Our \"perception of reality\" as you put it was not shaped by our thoughts; it was shaped by our experience.

I would give standing ovations when she threw a gutter, and pretend I was distracted when she threw a strike.\n- Kino. I don't ever let onto this, but I was a starter on my High School varsity bowling team. I still \"suck\" (sub 175 average), but I'm generally okay. I can show my date how to improve and throw a better ball. Best move? Show her the motions, let her throw. She'll mess it up. Now, on the next throw, say \"I'm going to walk with you, you need to take a 5 step approach.\" Now stand behind her VERY close. Put a hand on her bowling hand, and ask her to follow your hand as you walk to the line. It's rapid kino escalation, and pretty acceptable in the Bowling alley because you usually see someone else doing it. Also - that thing about teasing? Well you're an ass if you tease 100%. Go slap her a high five, double high five, or better yet, one of those double high fives where you lock hands.\n- Bowling alleys serve alcohol. Keep your wits about you, but allow yourself to unwind. \n- Bowling alleys also serve food. I'm not in this situation anymore, but where I used to live, there was NOTHING to do but maybe bowl or get coffee after 8pm. Good dates involve a change in venue. You can just go \"hey, wanna go grab a bite?\" Boom - minor change in venue when you sit in the bar area. Also - today, most alleys have healthy food options, so she can have really whatever she wants. \n\nFun story about eating. My very first F-Close when studying seduction.

Depth is reserved for the dating, after you've gotten her attention and she deems you worthy of depth.\n\n>Yes, you might succeed in asking out some girls who are looking to be asked out, especially you demonstrate sufficient value for them through superficially-observable qualities like looks, confidence, etc.\n\nDon't resign to assuming that clever and light flirtation is reserved for attractive men talking to desperate women. You're approaching a stranger for a superficial reason, and they will respond on a superficial level. That kind of light hearted, casual introduction requires low-commitment for her to respond, so she responds. Then you up the ante little by little, taking baby steps in escalation as to avoid making her feel awkward or pressured until she's fully engaged with you and more receptive to you (being a total fucking stranger). You save the \"deep\" or \"interesting\" conversation for the tail end, just before you say goodbye and it was nice meeting her and ask her for her number just as she's starting to warm up to you and wants more.\n\nYou get her hooked by making it a low-pressure, low-commitment thing for her to respond to. Something like \"hello, how's it going\" doesn't warrant a rejection on her part (she bites). Escalate it by generating the conversation, asking her more low-commitment questions, and capitalizing on opportunities in conversation to take it one *little* step deeper (reeling her in). Then just as you've got her talking about something she's interested in sharing with you, you're almost there and just need to not fuck up the close. Confidently end the conversation because \"you've got to get going but want to hear more about [thing she talked about] and you should exchange numbers.\" Schedule a date, and once you start going out you can explore your depth with eachother.\n\nIt's a very touch-and-go process, and you have to know that there's a level of interfacing with a stranger you're interested in that needs to happen before you can take it one deeper. You have to be calm and confident and service that initial superficial contact to earn the right to get deep.", "id": "d7wh579"}, {"comment": "I wholly agree with your sentiment and general approach, as well as your criticism of the OP.

It's a matter of making sure that subconsciously your approach requires very little commitment for her to respond to, because that's how you hook her. \n**Example:** you open up with some clever ice breaker, well now she's either under pressure to be clever back or to entertain the conversation you've started, and that's if she's a remotely considerate person. She can't just skip out if she wants, she feels that pressure and that commitment she has to make to talking to you knowing full well off the bat what you're trying to do is what creates awkwardness. If she's not interested she'll shut you down immediately; you're done before you've had a chance. My point is, she wants to enter in to a discussion that she can either roll with if she likes it or leave from if she doesn't, don't make an opener that makes them have to shut you down immediately or force themselves to talk to you. Just chat to another human being and escalate when the opportunities present themselves.\n \n> B) It doesn\u2019t solve the problem of how to start a real conversation that doesn\u2019t get awkward and leads to a solid number that leads to a meeting. \n\nThat's all PUA and escalation strategy, *and confidecne,* there's no quick fix to that. I think OP's value with this post is in the \"why you should talk to strangers\" part; it takes practice to get used to escalating. If you get awkward in conversations with girls, then start conversations with people at registers or at the post office or waiters - just chat them up and try to get a conversation going so the art of chit chat feels more intuitive to you. Confidence in yourself, true confidence, not trying to put on an image of confidence or expel it or peacock, but actually knowing that *you'll be okay* if you she rejects you, that *you* are just enjoying the moment and *you* want to know more about what she's saying, that's going to be the read she gets off of you, that's really the only trick to not getting awkward. Getting the number and going on a date is PUA and that's separate from approach anxiety.\n\n> Asking her out is great for demonstrating confidence, but it doesn\u2019t take away the fear for the guy of not knowing how to lead into the \u201creal\u201d conversation without having any external cues to work from (e.g., you\u2019re both at the same event that you can talk about).\n\nAgain, it seems like you want the opener to resolve more than approach anxiety. \n\nFirst off, you should never just go up and ask a girl out. You should chat with them first, and sometimes circumstances make that situation constrained and you have to quickly get to the point of asking her out because you're both at a gas station or at bagel shop or are in a situation where one of you has shit to go do. In those cases I like to own the fact that I'm asking her out based on her looks because she already knows that and will get big douchebag vibes if I don't acknowledge that, like using the fact that I'm approaching her as a conversation cue because I need results fast (ex: \"Hey, I'm sorry but I just think you're really pretty and I'd kick myself in the head later if I didn't say something to you.\")\n\nSecondly, whatever conversation you are having is up to the two of you. Whatever conversation you are in *is* the \"real\" conversation. And again, that's about escalation strategy. Approach anxiety is resolved entirely by practice and confidence - not because you want her to think you're confident, but because you need to be confident enough internally to speak up and be brave and say something. Starting with small talk helps you adjust to talking to her and helps her adjust to talking to you. And when you don't know what to say to start that conversation, just casually say \"hey, how's your day going\" and be friendly and casual until she gives you some material to work with which you can use to escalate.", "id": "d7xgyvq"}, {"comment": "\"Something interesting happen to you today?\"", "id": "d7vzsog"}, {"comment": "That question offers nothing to the recipient.

So that explains in some capacity why bad advice that cannot yield any positive results is seen by so many on here as good advice. Truth be told, most of the guys getting results aren't going to be on Seddit looking for advice -- they're out getting laid. I'm definitely in the minority. But the mystery remains, why is this advice so attractive on its face to the sexless masses? \n\nThere is an old episode of Seinfeld that was foundational for me as I developed skills with women. Essentially, George sees himself as an absolute failure in life and concludes that he must be doing everything wrong. He decides to do the opposite of whatever his impulses tell him to do, and everything ends up going his way. It's not quite that simple of course, but there is so much truth in that concept. You do so much that you don't even really give two thoughts to. Those things -- those bad habits -- are what is getting in your way -- *not* confidence. \n\nConfidence is the result of success. Success is not the result of confidence. So if you find yourself up-voting useless posts that say, \"all you need is confidence and then you will get the women\", my guess is that your problem has nothing to do with confidence -- you just have a bunch of bad habits (laziness being one of them). Yes, it's easier to try and think your way to success. It's the lazy man's path. Reversing your bad habits is not easy at all -- it's extremely difficult. But wouldn't you rather see results instead of just filling your head with feel-good bullshit? Results are permanent. But your phony confidence will always get shattered any time you are forced to face reality. \n\nStop worrying about your confidence. Get off your ass. Change your life. It will take a lot of work, but eventually you will have success. Then and only then will you get confidence. \n\nJust my two cents. "], [1, "I listen to music all the time but I don't feel that it hampers my ability to emotionally regulate."], [1, "Very nice.

There are neurobiological conditions behind this, usually--the autism rate is rising, about 1 in 45 men are on the spectrum.

So that explains in some capacity why bad advice that cannot yield any positive results is seen by so many on here as good advice. Truth be told, most of the guys getting results aren't going to be on Seddit looking for advice -- they're out getting laid. I'm definitely in the minority. But the mystery remains, why is this advice so attractive on its face to the sexless masses? \n\nThere is an old episode of Seinfeld that was foundational for me as I developed skills with women. Essentially, George sees himself as an absolute failure in life and concludes that he must be doing everything wrong. He decides to do the opposite of whatever his impulses tell him to do, and everything ends up going his way. It's not quite that simple of course, but there is so much truth in that concept. You do so much that you don't even really give two thoughts to. Those things -- those bad habits -- are what is getting in your way -- *not* confidence. \n\nConfidence is the result of success. Success is not the result of confidence. So if you find yourself up-voting useless posts that say, \"all you need is confidence and then you will get the women\", my guess is that your problem has nothing to do with confidence -- you just have a bunch of bad habits (laziness being one of them). Yes, it's easier to try and think your way to success. It's the lazy man's path. Reversing your bad habits is not easy at all -- it's extremely difficult. But wouldn't you rather see results instead of just filling your head with feel-good bullshit? Results are permanent. But your phony confidence will always get shattered any time you are forced to face reality. \n\nStop worrying about your confidence. Get off your ass. Change your life. It will take a lot of work, but eventually you will have success. Then and only then will you get confidence. \n\nJust my two cents.

Disgusted with myself, I studied like crazy for the next two months and walked into the second attempt thinking, \"oh shit oh shit oh shit\" and questioned everything that I did and thought, and I scored 1440 on that one. So in that case, confidence was the *enemy*. Much of life is like this. \n\nConfidence begetting success is a myth -- a myth that is designed to maintain the existing social hierarchy. It's not just limited to sex, it extends to all aspects of the world. \n\nIn fact, any time someone tells you that \"you can't have success without _____\" where the blank is some ethereal concept that can be applied to just about anything, **you are being bamboozled**. It's bullshit meant to make you accept your place at the bottom of the ladder and keep shoveling shit for them. \n\nYou need to stop letting people tell you what you need to succeed and just get out there and succeed! Be skeptical of anyone who promotes feel-good bullshit that doesn't have any sort of scientific foundation and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. \n\nAny time someone says, \"A leads to B\", you should always ask yourself the question, \"well, does A lead to B, or does B lead to A?\" Be skeptical.

No one. Ever.\n\n\u2022 Remove yourself from a bad situation instead of waiting for the situation to change.\n\n\u2022 Don't tolerate the intolerable \u2014 ever.\n\n\u2022 Stop blaming. Victims never succeed.\n\n\u2022 Live with integrity. Decide what feels right to you, then do it.\n\n\u2022 Accept the consequences of your actions.\n\n\u2022 Be good to yourself.\n\n\u2022 Think \"abundance.\"\n\n\u2022 Face difficult situations and conflict head on.\n\n\u2022 Don't do anything in secret.\n\n\u2022 Do it now.\n\n\u2022 Be willing to let go of what you have so you can get what you want.\n\n\u2022 Have fun.

It's that when you do anything for someone else, you need to ask yourself if you're compromising your own life for someone elses sake, or if it clashes with your values. If the answer is yes to either, don't. This is part of your value, having integrity.\n\nAlthough there are always exceptions like when someone's life might be on the line, etc. Just think it through.\n\nAs for how not to be a people pleaser. Learn to say no. That's it. Once you do, you can hold your own opinion, you can say no to people who ask you of things, you'll gain respect instead of being the kiss ass.\n\nKeep in mind that once you start saying no, it might spark conflict and negative feelings. But those things are a necessity, just like how you can't have happiness with out sadness. Besides, you can't please everyone.\n\nFor social awkwardness gain as much field experience as possible. Talk to everyone, I mean everyone. You can even just say hi in passing. I've had random people say hi in passing for whatever reason, but it's always nice. You need to create a bigger comfort zone, one that encompasses good social skills. That'll take time and effort.\n\nLearn about social skills from any resource you can, or want, to smooth things along. One way or another, you'll have to experience a lot embarrassments and failures before it all clicks. It's worth it though, big time. There's a lot of opportunities that open up as you meet more people.\n\nThe most important thing of all this though, in my opinion, is to understand what you're doing.

You don't need it in bulk. The small selection is all that matters. When buying wine keep in mind that there are many different kinds of wines.

Having a bottle of red *and* then a lighter fruity and sweet wine can go a long way.  \n  \nBut for vodka, I have to be honest... It all kind of tastes the same. Stay away from Three Olives brand, it's trashy and gets sticky very fast if it is the flavored kind.  \n  \nMy personal list is:  \nJose Cuervo Gold tequila (my personal favorite).  \nA small bottle of fireball whiskey (I really hate this shit.). \nNew Amsterdam vodka. (Basic vodka, relatively cheap, hard to tell the difference between most other vodkas).  \nRex Goliath red wine (from the grocery store.). \nMadrid Sangria Moscato sweet & fruity.

Each situation is going to be different.\n\nBut the most important thing when flirting is your pace. It starts subtle and escalates based on continually judging the other person's reactions. If they're into it, it shouldn't be hard to figure out. If they're smiling or flirting back, you keep moving forward.\n\nDon't wait for a girl to give off signs for you to decipher. If you can get some eye contact and a smile, that at least means you can go make polite conversation without making them uncomfortable.", "id": "d7ovm64"}, {"comment": "Yea I'm pretty introverted and do suffer from social anxiety on some level at least. When I go out (with women, or even with friends, sometimes) I find that I have to treat it like a performance, or like stepping on stage; I need to psych myself up for the human interaction and wind up feeling drained afterwards. Not sure how to relax or what it would take for flirting to become actual \"fun\" for me, aside from just doing it over and over again until I get used to it like most advice seems to suggest. Still haven't reached that point yet.", "id": "d7pv726"}, {"comment": "Yeah you're introverted. So am I so don't let the lack of energy or feeling that you need the occasional break get to you. Totally normal. Introverted doesn't mean antisocial. \n\nIt's like if you don't put the energy into it to consciously \"perform\", you'll end up sitting there all night just listening or caught up in your own head. I'm perfectly content a lot of times just being in the background and doing that, but you won't make connections with others unfortunately.\n\nI'm not sure what really changed in me besides realizing the above and just gaining more confidence, being comfortable just being myself. I don't really consider it a performance if I'm just being my relaxed self. I just go out, do my thing, and the only forcing of interaction I do is just pushing myself to ask people I don't know questions about themselves, listening, and trying to find some sort of way to relate. I've had people think I'm the best conversationalist when I didn't even say much and just listened.\n\nIf you can listen and show genuine interest in others, it really gives you an edge over people who just want to talk or only take superficial interest in others. If you don't feel comfortable or don't like being super outgoing, don't. Nothing wrong with that. Showing an interest in others and that you enjoy their company is what attracts people. We all just want acceptance, validation, and a way to connect/relate. Focus on that.

I've gotten really good at faking it but I'm tired of feeling scrutinized by an ordeal that I wasn't allowed to see and I'm tired of scrutinizing others looking for hints. There's no comfort in being able to live your life when you're denied a basic grip on reality because somebody decided that it should all be kept from you. It's like being locked in a soundproofed room of one-way mirrors in the middle of Times Square because you have no idea what the scope of it all was but everybody seems to think they know your backstory now and it ripples into every aspect of life. I can't work. I can't be around people. I'm pissed at everyone and everything because I want to let go of this but I have no way to move on in this state and it's been a 5 year nightmare that won't stop because I've been denied the chance to process it and be done with it. If you could be me for a day you would see that this farce of an existence is cruel and unusual. I've lived through a string of harsh experiences that would destroy some people but I would do it all again for the rest of my life just for one day of partial clarity on what happened back in 2011.

I just need some idea of what, how, who and enough information so I can make some sort of sense of it and have peace and have my feet back on the ground. I don't care that I look nuts and somebody out there might think that this is funny...I don't care...this is a nightmare and I need it to stop. I wish somebody else could Vulcan mind-meld with me and experience this so I'd at least have one person who could understand. Even if it was meant to be torture, you'd think one person would throw me a bone and just tell me why so many people are so assuming of me now and know very specific things about me, or rather slightly off version of those things, echoed from person after person. Imagine taking the normal stress of life and multiplying that by every red flag experience where someone seems to be sure that they know all about personal details that you didn't share and it colors every relationship and my own perception and behavior and everything just feels fake and forever contrived and weighed down by this elephant in the room and an entire human life feels like some trivialized media blurb interest story or whatever that happened half a decade ago and despite a lifetime of extraordinary pain, not only do you get turned into a sideshow but it feels like you're the only one who's not in on the joke because they don't think you can handle knowing but they still feel compelled to brief the people in your life who weren't around for the first showing so they 'understand' you more when it really just makes it worse because not only are they underestimating your ability to handle the truth but piling on more humiliation with no direct visibility just makes every day a new reminder that you're broken and everyone thinks you're too weak to know the truth so it never gets better and you're never allowed to close the book.](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/11/11/5-secretive-nsa-code-names-that-sound-like-everyday-things/)", "id": "d7nwi41"}, {"comment": "It doesn't matter.

I stayed in most of my childhood due to strict parents, so hanging with friends and going out playing wasn't a option for me. Now that I am moving up to a junior in highschool, I have been given much more freedom than ever. HOWEVER IF I HAVEN'T discover seduction and self-improvement, I would of stay the introvert non-social guy forever. If you're stuck as a introvert growing up, then that is your comfort zone and so without any guidance you wont get out of that little shitty mentality. I got my first heart broken in 8th grade and that ruined my life... socially, mentally, you can name it. I had no motivation to do anything until one day i stumbled upon something along the lines of \"how to get better with girls\". One thing lead to another and I was in the self-improvement side for quite a while until I actually became more social and not depending on women for happiness. Rather stuff i did on a daily basis but at the same time being social and outgoing. The only real reason why i got into self development was because of girls, picking up girls and seduction. After a few months of self-improvement, i found out that not only is it helping me with women, but also helping me to become a better person, becoming the best version of myself. I became more social, less introverted and way more outgoing. I wasn't the guy that everyone knew in 8th grade, I was a entirely new person the start of 10th grade. I got comments from a lot of my friends on how i changed for the better. I was not longer the lonely guy sitting in the corner talking softly trying best to not be heard. \n\n\nSo overall learning seduction essentially leads to self-improvement, becoming the best version of yourself before learning to attract girls. Honestly if i didn't learn seduction, I wouldn't be learning self-improvement. And those 2 things has improved my \"teenage\" life significantly. YOU DON'T STAY YOUNG FOREVER, and you can stay dead for all eternity. So why not go out there no matter how old you are and try your best? It doesn't matter if its seduction or self-improvement.

I have had thoughts of quitting music and going into a more financially lucrative freelancing profession that will allow me leeway for my libidinous activities. Yet, I have come around to the conclusion that music can be and is undeniably financially lucrative in this day and I can exercise my own self-agency to customize a freelancing profession that will best suit my needs and wants and not merely replicate a blueprint model adhering to an economic, social or cultural framework (getting a 9-5, settling down, paying off a mortgage and university education).

Let me tell you how divorce ended for one of my friends:\n\nHe met his wife in college, they fell madly in love and got married, then had a couple kids. She was his beautiful dream woman and he would do anything for her, and he did. At first they were content and happy, but then she quit her job and started expecting a cushy life. After a while, this expectation turned into a demand. He worked 60-80 hour work weeks to provide a good life to her and her kids, while she sat at home, shopped online and gained a hundred pounds. He busted his fucking ass for 8 years for her. And how did she repay him? She decided to start fucking the neighbor.\n\nSo she started to conspire with her lawyer. How much could they get out of a divorce? She cleverly gathered evidence against him to show \"emotional hardship\" due to the fact that he was away from home working so much. Then she slams him with the divorce papers, and he's so blind-sided by it, he has no time to prepare any defense. Not to mention the fact that now he has to pay for HER lawyer, he's pulling even more work hours, and has barely enough money to hire his own. Imagine working until midnight, knowing those dollars you're earning are going to a lawyer who's job it is to take MORE of your money. It's just absolutely insane.\n\nSuffice it to say, he got fucked hard in court. She took most of his assets, and he now has to hand over half of his take-home salary to her every month for the next decade. She got the house, she has a new boyfriend living there, she doesn't have to work. The law has decided that a fair outcome to this is that he be a slave to his fat ex wife for the foreseeable future, while she sits at home being a fat lazy cunt who's only contribution to society is comes out of her ass in the form of vapor. And now, he's a shell of the man he used to be; depressed, hopeless, and looks like a 50-year old even though he's barely in his 30's."], [2, "Woah!

You have to fucking acknowledge that there is something seriously wrong with you that you have to change, stepping up.\n\n\n\nIf i took that advice, i would probably still be the shy, anti-social, introverted guy like i was in 8th grade. Things don't get better on their own, it gets better when you put the effort into become the best version of yourself. Find the cons and make them pros. Fix that shit and stop being the little bitch. Point being, if you didn't grow up receiving good feedback from girls, then you're fucked. And that's where seduction comes in. \n\n\nOP said that girls has chased after him for his looks, but he was too afraid to ask them out. How about growing up not having ANY girls come after you? At that point you would know you're fucking ugly and you have to improve your personality. Girls find OP attractive, that gives him a better chance with girls. And a little help with seduction, he can improve his chances drastically.", "id": "d4uegzj"}, {"comment": "Fair enough.  I appreciate the discussion and your well-written reply instead of \"FUCK YOU DUMBASS OP!!!\"  \n\nI agree with you, and think I might not have been clear enough about what I was saying.  My main point that I was trying to convey wasn't to just be passive and accept life as it is given to you, but more as a way so people who were maybe struggling and feeling like failures could look back on their life and not solely judge it based on romantic success, but realize that they have actually had lots of successes and created a solid foundation to build upon.  I do see a lot of guys in here who it sounds like are amazing people, but they're beating themselves up over their dating life and totally ignoring other accomplishments they've made.\n\nI think one reason people don't start new things is because it can be very intimidating to see how much work you have to do, so it's frightening to even take that first step.  I'm like that with music now, I've played a lot of bluegrass, but I want to do more jazz, but I've been procrastinating starting to learn because I feel behind and intimidated by how much I have to do, when I really need to realize I've set myself up with a good ear and some ideas to build off of, but again, easier said than done.  However, I think if guys who are freaking out about how far they have to go and how much work they have to do could take a deep breath, step back, and say \"hey, I've done a lot of work already\" and take note of what they already have going for them, and how they were the driving force behind making that happen, it will allow them to approach self-improvement without worrying so much about it, and thus handicapping themselves.\n\nI do agree that you do need to work on yourself and that was HUGE in my development.  All the foundation in the world won't matter if you stay inside all the time, don't meet people, and don't take an active role in your personal development.  What I meant by there's a lot you don't have control over was that certain things, like having to live with your parents during summers between semesters, or not having disposable income because you're paying for school, or any other obstacle facing a young-adult, can make dating much more difficult.  I absolutely did not mean that it makes it impossible and that it should be an excuse to say \"eh, things are beyond my control right now, I'm just going to not do anything and become amazing tomorrow.\"  If I had discovered self-improvement at a younger age, I can only imagine how much the quality of my life would have been improved.\n\nThank you again for your insights, I feel like it was a good thing to clear up as, again, I absolutely do not want to encourage people to take a passive role in their development as an individual.  I guess the best way I can think of it is that let's say you're on a ship in the ocean, certain things in life when you're younger may may the seas stormier, but you still have control over that wheel, no reason to let go and see where you end up without trying to steer.", "id": "d4ufwea"}, {"comment": "Thanks man, that got rid of any confusions i had along the way reading your post.

Hmm, that's a tough question, I'm still kind of coming out of the woods, so to speak, and realizing that I am a desirable partner is still kind of new, so I don't really know what the long-term holds for sure.  \n\nFor me, once I had made the major adjustments and things started clicking, I was kind of like: \"whoa.\"  I mean, success with women was new to me, so it was like I had found this new power and I was worried that I would wake up one day and it'd be gone, so I definitely slept with as many women as possible then.  Now, after I've realized that I did all the work and the changes I had made were internal, so they wouldn't just disappear, I've calmed down a bit.  Instead of focusing on sex, I try and focus on having fun getting to know a new person, and if it leads to sex, then great, but if not and I still had fun, it's a win.  Also, I've become more comfortable turning down sex.  Up until recently if a woman was giving indicators that she wanted to sleep with me, or I felt like she would in the near future, I'd ride it out even though I could tell I wasn't that into her, because sex.  Now, even if she's putting it out there, I've been able to think \"ok, I'm not really enjoying myself, so why have sex that will lead to the awkwardness of trying to avoid this person later?\"\n\nI think this will naturally lead to a more fulfilling long-term relationship.  Dating and sleeping with a lot of people has really made me more aware of what I want.  First off, now I'm not going to rush into a relationship just because someone will have sex with me.  I know I'm desirable and that's led me to realize I deserve to choose a good partner for myself.  Secondly, I've had amazing sex with women who I clashed with personality-wise, and I've had to end things with women whom I really loved as people that just didn't do it for me in bed.  I'm hoping my increase in self-awareness and what I need from a relationship will lead me to select a good partner with whom I can spend an extended amount of time with happily.  \n\nThat said, I know amazing men and women who have been together for some time and are somewhat discontent.  I think that's part of the human condition, it's either too hot or too cold, so to speak.  I imagine when you're out tom-catting around the idea of a long-term relationship seems good, but when you find that you'll miss being out on the town.  So in that regard, I think it goes back to finding out who you are and what you want.  For me, I think it's natural to reminiscence on the part of your life when you were having fun hook-ups, both for men and women, but I'm hoping I'll find a partner who doesn't make me forget about that (that's a lot to ask of anyone), but who makes fidelity an easy choice, even if I look back on sleeping around fondly.  \n\nAgain, I think you really need to get your legs under you and find some degree of stability before this question can be answered.  Up to at least 25, you go through so many changes in a brief time, and life can be pretty chaotic, so it's hard to answer.  It seems like life has stages.  I've noticed women tend to like to date up a few years (generally speaking), and I've come to an area where I've been seeing a lot of amazing women who are anywhere from 23-26, but they're all finishing up college and getting jobs out of state, or getting into a graduate program out of state, so I'm hoping when I hit my 30's I'll be around more women who are settling in to their careers and able to pursue a lasting relationship.\n\nLooking back (and forward), I think one's 20's should be really used for maximizing one's 30's.

But it great and shows that sometimes we're all on the same page, and it's not necessarily like men are just horn-dogs for wanting it sometimes.\n\nsex question, since you're so experienced: i'm very good at giving oral since that's all i was allowed to do for those 7 yrs.  i think i'm probably just average at PIV sex (although i have a great physique).  i'm starting to think that my 'performance' is always the same... i don't think i've really gotten any better, my moves are always the same, and my weaknesses for the most part are the same.  i'm wondering if you felt like you've improved (e.g., can last longer, do more ambitious positions, etc) as time has gone on, or do you think you've always been about the same across time, too?", "id": "d4u9pdl"}, {"comment": "Hmm, I would say you can't really improve physically too much, besides weightloss and increasing your cardio capacity, or unless there's an underlying problem like ED or PE, but your dick is your dick and that's about it.  What I have improved on is reading women, communication, and learning about how women get pleasure from sex.\n\nReading women is big because you can figure out when something's working and that will obviously be an advantage.  Like when you're going down on her and hit the right spot, noting how she responds, and finding that response on other women.  Now, in my experiences, the spots/techniques for one woman to another can vary greatly, but the response (thighs quivering, sharp inhale) are more universal.\n\nCommunication is great.  I don't date men, so I don't really know that well, but it seems like women have a lot more variety when it comes to how they cum, so just asking: \"do you orgasm more from clitoral or internal stimulation?\" (only more sexy like) can help you decide how to approach.\n\nAlso, just realizing that some women, while they like sex, have a harder time cumming than others was big.  I bought a Hitachi Magic Wand, it makes sex a lot less \"work\" because if she wants to cum, but is having a hard time, it almost always works when she's guiding it, and the amount of women who have said something like: \"wow, you're one of the only guys I've met who has a toy just for female pleasure\" is staggering.  \n\nAs far as lasting longer, I do feel I've improved, but that was more by masturbating and taking more time.  I also still have quick days and long days.  And as far as ambitious positions go, it's fun to try something new, but I tend to stick to varients of missionary, cowgirl, doggy, and side-by-side.  Those Kamasutra books I think give create some poor ideas about sex.  I've tried them with a girlfriend, and it's not hot.  Like: \"Ok, your leg here, mine here, WHOA, don't fall\" and then when you're in there's not really a lot you can do.

Had to put it out there though as I think when people hear I've slept with 90 women, I have to be honest and admit that it wasn't all me doing pickup, a good chunk (20?) was me being involved with people who were into group play, which is pretty interesting and unique to meet men and women who are that secure with themselves, each other, and their needs.\n\nHmm...definitely not most of them.  I would say maybe 20%?  And then, like you said, the competition can be tougher in a city LA, but you can streamline your profile better.  When I was in NY I had \"visiting for the weekend!  Show me around?\" which is pretty clear what's up (even in town when you're on Tinder you can do something like that.  The thing is, women who are just looking for a hookup don't want you to be a dick or make them feel like a slut, which, oddly, a lot of guys do, so as a dude, you really can't have \"just looking for something casual\" or \"just here to hookup\" cause it translates to: \"eeeeey babeh, want sum fuk?\"  Gotta say more along the lines of \"Not necessarily looking for anything too serious right now, but open to possibilities.\")  So when a girl picks me up with that profile, it's kind of mutual understood that I'm out of town, etc.\n\nThat said, I honestly think there's way too much emphasis on closing on a first date, like it's the ultimate goal.  It's great when it happens naturally, and when I viewed sex as the goal of pickup I would try to make it happen as much as possible (bounce, strategic locations, etc), but now, honestly, it's just too much work for someone I don't know.  Also, with the vast majority of women I've been with (save for those who are extremely in touch with their sexuality) having a date where there's really not a possibility of having sex, like coffee mid-day, builds comfort, which leads them to be more open to a sexual date like dessert and a movie at your place.  Also, it makes *me* more comfortable, because I always have an imaginary appointment that I can cancel or push back, like dinner with my mom, or plans with friends, that way I'm not worried about ditching out on her, conversation getting stale, or blowing a Saturday night with some lame chick when I could have been out with my friends.\n\nI really think the emphasis (and this is tough, especially when I was just getting in to this.  At that time I would have told myself: \"fuck you man!  Easy for you to say, but if I don't get my dick wet I am going to explode!\"  So take it with a grain of salt and focus on what your needs are now, this should be a natural progression) should be on having a good time over having sex.  I recently brought a woman home and it seemed like we were going to have sex, but then she started feeling kind of nauseous from the booze and puked up some, so we just went to bed.  We never really ended up seeing each other after that, I started pursuing women I was more into and I imagine she did the same with men, but I had a great night, enjoyed her company, had a good makeout session, so I chalk it up as a win.  At first I was kind of like: \"Lame!  Can't call it a win because we didn't have sex.\"  Like I had failed because all of this stuff is supposed to be about sex, but upon reconsideration, I realized, \"ok, I went out with a pretty girl, we had a great make out session, and fun conversation, that's a win.\"  If she's willing to make out with me in public, it feeds my need for validation because I'm obviously doing something to the point where she's ok with people around us seeing us together.  I mean, when I thought about that, I remembered when I would sleep with women I wouldn't be caught dead with out on the town, so really, I felt like it was just as good, if not better than sleeping with her.  \n\nAlso, always play the long game.  If I had been butt-hurt about not fucking and whined about it, A) there probably wouldn't have been any future opportunity B) she most likely would have told her friends, but now, when I come up in conversation, I'm the guy who was a total gentleman when she got sick, held her hair back, and didn't make her feel bad at all, so any woman who hears that will have some feelings of comfort and trust towards me.  Also, just to be clear, and I'm sure you know this, but I just have to say it, whining about sex or getting people to fuck you because they feel obligated to is super lame, not a cool way to treat people, but even more, not characteristics of a cool man.

Yet, I have come around to the conclusion that music can be and is undeniably financially lucrative in this day and I can exercise my own self-agency to customize a freelancing profession that will best suit my needs and wants and not merely replicate a blueprint model adhering to an economic, social or cultural framework (getting a 9-5, settling down, paying off a mortgage and university education). Perhaps music, or any artistic profession that is reputed with uncertainty and instability, is perfect for the seducer/cassanova lifestyle, which in itself is tarnished with uncertainty and instability - which what makes it so great to immerse oneself in.

I finished university and have finally started my full time career. Got a car and a motorcycle. getting an apartment in the next year or so. I've been with 7 girls so far, two of which were long term. \n\nDuring university I was severely overweight so I didn't put much priority on women. I felt as though I would be settling for girls I wasnt attracted to simply because I was fat. \n\nI'm currently still losing weight, but I've packed on a lot of muscle, and my height allows me to carry the fat better than most.\n\n I have no problem getting numbers in person, I'm a tall husky dude. Girls ask me if I'm a bouncer when I go out. I'm not unattractive, but I'm also not hot stuff at least not yet, still working on that dream body.\n\nI suck at messaging, when it comes to online dating it's even worse. I can't even get matches. When I do manage to get matches, my texting game fails me and it's back to the drawing board. When I do manage to get a date, It almost always goes well.\n\nThe general failings with online dating and texting has been getting me down lately.

You've learned what you don't like, being overweight and insecure, and I imagine with the weight loss you've had, you have seen your confidence increase.  \n\nI was awful at text/online dating, still struggle with text, but the texting guides on the sidebar here helped me greatly.  Good advice on how to do things like \"ping\" without coming off as overly needy.  Something like instead of \"hey, just thinking of you, how's your day?\" (which might be nice for the long-term, but can be too clingy at first) send a funny picture or something that doesn't really give her any indications that you need her to respond, but allows her to respond on her own time when her mood is right.  That will be a good indicator for you to gauge interest, if she responds she's into it, if not (don't take this as gospel, there could be other reasons) you haven't come off as needy, and it also creates a positive association with seeing your name pop up, like \"this guy's funny and I like it when he texts me\" not \"hmmm, is he one of those guys who falls in love too fast?\"\n\nAlso, having a motorcycle is great, because it shows you're into things.  I've had guys tell me \"no wonder you get laid, you have a motorcycle.\"  And while it certainly doesn't hurt, I always need to explain \"I didn't buy this as a tool to attract women, I bought it because I like riding and I want to learn how to work on my own bike.  Sure, it might be fun to go out for a ride, but women aren't attracted to that as much as they are to the fact that I have a passion and skill I am pursuing.\"  Take my buddy who's a rock-climber, I can't do that, but I still get laid, he might not have a motorcycle, but he still gets laid, it's not that rock-climbing or motorcycling is this magical aphrodisiac, it's that it makes us interesting as men.  And, while he ends up with \"earthier\" girls and I end up with more rocker-types, you could be a cheese-ball on the nicest Harley money could buy, and it wouldn't get you anywhere.  I mean, think about it, we can smell fakes.  You've seen it, that dude who's in his mid-40's and looks ridiculously out of place on his brand-new Harley, it's easy to tell he just walked into the dealership and tried to buy something interesting about himself, but it backfired.  That's what I tell people about what I'm looking for in women too, I want someone who's passionate about something that's not just working and drinking, hell, it could be that she loves going home and painting pictures of her cats, but just that she has something she does that enriches her as a person draws me towards her.\n\nKeep up the good work, having your own place is amazing.  Tinder dating when I was with my parents was hard.  Still worked sometimes, but definitely harder to be spontaneous.  I remember one time on a tinder date, we were finishing up at coffee and deciding what to do next.  She pulls me in, kisses me, and whispers in my ear \"we could go back to your place...\" and I say \"...my mom's home.\"  Didn't stop things dead, we kept seeing each other for sometime and remain close friends, but sure made things a helluva lot harder!\n\nThere's a lot of good resources on here about Tinder and OkCupid.  Search out the subreddits for both.  When I was Tindering a lot one thing that really helped me was I used Gimp (free photoshop-type program) to make a ridiculously profile picture.  I (intentionally crappily) put my head over some really ripped dude so it was clearly fake and in my profile had \"photoshop expert\" as part of my description, just something to a) make them pause when my picture popped up and b) make them laugh when they read my description.\n\nAlso, I can't tell you how important this is and good that you have started, keep up the weight loss.  Also, remember, this isn't a temporary diet or work-out routine, you're changing your life and eating better/treating your body better from here on out.  Doesn't mean you can't have cheat days, but thinking of things like they're a \"diet\" implies they're temporary, which cannot be so if you don't want to lose progress, you've bettered yourself permanently.", "id": "d4uf4p8"}, {"comment": "I always get the \"you have a motorcycle, chicks dig motorcycles\" thing as well.\n\nI always tell people who say that \"I've gotten more guys numbers then girls numbers from owning a bike\".

I am an incoming college freshman and I was really afraid about entering the real world in 4-6 years. Everyone says life after college sucks and I can never tell if they're being sarcastic or not. This gives me hope. ", "id": "d4u3lez"}, {"comment": "Oh man, it's so much better.  The guys I knew in college (I went to a private liberal arts college in the midwest, paid for it with scholarship, financial aid, and busting my ass over summers, lots of kids with money there though) who said that came from wealthy families.  I don't look down on them because nobody chooses who their parents are, and wouldn't we all want to have that financial support?  However, to them college was just going to classes and doing homework, they didn't really have any responsibilities beyond passing class.  Summers were trips to Martha's Vineyard, flying across the country to meet the friends they had made, and partying.  For me, college was still fun (mindset comes into play here, and it was hard for me sometimes, seeing how free and easy it was for some people, but I had good friends and found my niche, which, oddly enough, wasn't at college at all.  Made friends with some of the townspeople who were into playing music, so don't limit your options), but it was going to class, going to my student job, getting home and doing the homework I hadn't finished at work.  Then Summers were coming back home, washing dishes, lifeguarding, laying tile, and doing any odd-job I could find to put money away for the next year.\n\nLike I said, I decided to make it fun, but it was a struggle and nothing I would care to repeat.  After college while I was still married I started at trade school while turning wrenches at various auto shops (I was never a badass mechanic or anything, just did oil changes, tires, belts, hoses, etc), got divorced and moved back in with my parents while continuing trade school.  That was a drag too, super humbling to announce a marriage, have it not work out, and move back home, felt like everyone was watching me (slightly narcissistic I guess, they were probably worried about their own bills and families, but that's what those things feel like) and that I was a failure.  Finished trade school (1,500 dollars total, fuck yeah.  A lot of my college credits transferred over) and now work a union-job and am so, so happy.  \n\nI live within my means in a one-bedroom apartment and drive an older pickup, but I have enough money where I can afford to take a trip once in a while and pursue a hobby like fixing an old motorcycle.  Having a strong union and a job that involves going to work, doing your job, and coming home, not something like a lawyer where you're working on a case and there's not really a concrete way to judge when you're done working for the day, gives me enough stability to live comfortably, if not lavishly, but it gives me satisfaction, because I like what I do, and it gives me time to be me.\n\nAlso, some people might say: \"Aha!  So college is worthless because you ended up going to trade school and becoming a blue-collar laborer, you should have just done that from the start!\"  I disagree, for me.  Not to say that it's the right path for everyone, if you've always wanted to be a mechanic or a plumber, then go for it, no need for a four-year degree (and I do agree that college is being shoved down kids' throats without much consideration as to what they really want and creating a generation that is confused why they can't get a job with an art degree).  I learned a lot in college, both in and out of class.  I majored in music and still love to play music, I learned about living with people, managing work, school, and time, and I was able to get out with minimal debt (which is also important, I would advise one who isn't sure of what they want to do, like I was when I went to college, to maybe pick a school that's not their dream college, but is still cool, if it saves them some money), so even though I could be more advanced in my career now, I don't feel like I'd be as well-rounded as I am today.  \n\nIt was worth it to me, hopefully it will be to you, but it comes down to that knowing yourself well and what you want from life.  Also, this can be really, really hard and is easier said then done.  When I went to college at 18, I didn't know who I was (still don't, but have a better idea), much less what I wanted from life, a career, relationship, etc.  So this might be a good time to seek a little advice and have a little faith in an adult-figure who seems content with their life.  I was blessed with having financially-smart parents and a friend, who, in his 40's, walked away from a \"dream\" job, because it didn't fulfill him, so between the two I was able to have some very good insights about how to budget for the future while considering the difference between a \"good\" job, and a job that's good for you.\n\nEdit: Also, wrap it up.

Oh man, no matter what mindset you have or how many things you read, it still hurts, all you can do with mindset and information is try and minimize the pain and maximize your recovery time.  \n\nFirst off, don't drink.  When I got divorced I spent a week drunk and it was pathetic.  I was happy to learn my then wife felt like I did and we were splitting, but everyone else (parents especially, they were great to me and helped me a lot, but definitely were like \"are you sure this is right?\" and caused me to doubt myself).  Not only was I getting divorced, but instead of moving on like a badass, I was a pathetic drunk. \n\nInstead of drinking hit the gym, go hiking, go to a movie, go out, just keep activities where it'd be easy to be centered around booze limited.\n\nI know you asked for mindset, but physicality and mindset are intertwined, you can't feel good inside if you're poisoning yourself with (too much) booze, drugs, and bad food (everything in moderation, even moderation), just like all the working out in the world won't hide unconfident body language.  \n\nSo as far as mindset goes, I recently (within the past two years) had two really hard relationships that ended and I'll try to explain.  \n\n**Woman A:** Woman of my dreams, beautiful, fit, intelligent, finishing graduate school when we met and becoming a sex-therapist.  Incredible company when we weren't naked and everything I had ever wanted in bed.  We never pursued a long term thing because when we got together she was applying for teaching jobs at colleges across the country.  I knew it would end, but it still hurt when it did, especially now because she is the standard for every woman I meet.  I haven't placed her on a pedestal, she's fallible like everyone else, she was just the whole package, smart, good career she was passionate about, amazing friend, and amazing lover.  \n\nI never told her I had loved her because I was trying to insulate myself from the future I knew was coming, but she recently wrote me and told me how much she had cared about me.  It was bittersweet, to know we felt the same, but because of logistics it couldn't work, but it was also validating to know my feelings were reciprocated and someone that amazing could love me.  So with her I just try and keep in the mindset that I had an amazing experience with an incredible human being, something that is far too rare.  Also, I use it as a learning experience that really solidified what I am looking for in a long-term partner and that I am capable and deserving of being loved by someone who is right for me, so if someone tells me or makes me feel they're as good as I'll be able to get and I should compromise my needs (every relationships will have some degree of compromise, people who say \"never compromise\" are either full of it, or incredibly lucky to meet someone they never have to compromise for, but I would imagine it's more that their partners are unhappy.  You just need to find the right amount of compromise and make sure your partner is willing to compromise for you as well, in that the energy you input is returned in kind) I can stand firm even though the thought of being alone and unloved can make it seem appealing, especially if she's hot (what can I say, I am but a man).\n\n\n**Woman B**: Very sweet, very pretty doctor.  Her family owns a brewery in California as well, so that's a plus.  We had a blast going out together and I really enjoyed her friendship.  Just not at all what I was looking for in bed.  Missionary 90% of the time, no verbal cues, not adventurous at all.  I don't mean swinging from the bed posts and having group sex, I mean I made her cry when I asked if she'd like to use my Hitachi Magic Wand (I always cover it with a barrier, usually a latex condom, and clean it).  I mean, I didn't pressure her, I just said \"hey, would you like to try a vibrator?\" and she started crying.  I would have been fine with a \"no\" but she was upset because it made her think of me being with other people.  \n\nThat should have been a red-flag, but because I like her so much, I stuck it out for a little bit which only caused her to get more attached, so when it came down to her saying \"This is what I want from you, where are we at?\" I had to hurt someone I really cared about and it didn't feel good.  I was sad that I wouldn't be seeing her anymore and I felt bad about causing someone pain.  Again, you have to be selfish in this life and do right by you, but that doesn't mean you need to be heartless, it's ok to feel that pain, because not wanting to go through that again I now know to break things off when someone's not right for me, but investing in me.\n\n\nSo, those are two different, longer relationships I've had, I hope they were helpful.  In a nutshell I'd say this is my strategy for ending a relationship with someone I loved:\n\n-Don't be a worthless drunk, you will not drink it off, you will end up with a hangover and a clouded mind on top of all the other shit going on inside you.\n\n-Workout (or any sort of physical activity).  Yeah, it's a cliche at this point, but it helps.  And you don't even have to go to the gym and get shredded, just leaving your phone at home and going for a walk around the block can work wonders.  Get out of the house.\n\n-Learn that it's ok to be sad and that that sadness is trying to tell you something, you just have to listen to it and figure out what that is.  Once you find out what it means, you can continue as a stronger, wiser person.  Everyone's different, there's no right thing to learn from this, this is something you must figure out on your own, but that's what's so cool about it, you've been you your whole life, and you're still learning new things about who you are.\n\n-Meet someone else.  Be careful because you don't want to project the love you had from whoever you're missing onto this person and windup in another serious relationship just because you were hurting, but having a somewhat casual sexual partner to do things with in and out of the bedroom can go a long way in taking your mind off things and easing the pain.  I'm not saying write off the possibilities of another LTR, because that'd be equally stupid, to blow it with the perfect woman just because you're beat-up, just proceed slowly, with caution, and crystal clear communication, let them know what's going on with you.  That might stop you from getting laid if she's looking for a LTR, but it'll save you a lot of needless emotional drainage (and not mess with someone else, double win!).  Abundance mentality is important here because you can feel alone and scared that you'll never meet someone you feel that way about again, so when you start sleeping with someone else, it's easy to latch on, don't.\n\n-Know what you're worth and what you desire.  This can be hard because you might feel unlovable and your confidence might be shaken, but just think back to what you've had to overcome to get here and that, at one point, the person you ended things with thought enough of you to enter a LTR, meaning you satisfied them on many different levels, from your appearance, your personality, your lifestyle, and sexually, and that you have a lot to offer to someone who is deserving of it.  ", "id": "d4uc2l3"}, {"comment": "Hey man, thank you so much for taking your time to write this out for me. It truly means a lot. Especially the fact that a random stranger would take time out of his day to offer advice to someone he hasn't even met. \n\nTo be honest, your advice truly helps. It's been 3 months and it sucks a little. I still care about her, but I know that there isn't a point in pursuing her right now. I do hope that in the future, her and I can work things out again. But we never know what the future has in store. :)\n\nI'm glad I dislike the taste of drinks. Definitely has kept me away from them during this time. I've been working out more and harder then ever. It really does help me feel good.\n\nWhen you talked about \" sadness is trying to tell you something\", what did you learn? What did your sadness represent in your situation? It's interesting to know that the sadness I feel has a deeper reason.\n\nI didn't think anyone would be supportive of the idea of me meeting someone else so soon. I've always had the impression that meeting someone as soon as a relationship has ended simply serves as a \"rebound relationship\". I'm definitely looking for LTRs and not to get laid. How did you find the motivation to meet someone new? Currently in my life, I do have multiple girls/women I feel attracted to, but not that much to bring me to work on dating or getting to know them better. It's hard to explain. I feel it may be thoughts about my ex holding me back. How'd you overcome this?\n\nOnce again, thank you for taking your time to type this out. ", "id": "d4wwkia"}, {"comment": "No problem.  That's the great part about communities like these.  You can be completely open without worrying about how it might change the way those close to you think of you.  Also, if I can help anyone learn from my mistakes, I'll feel good about myself, so I'm glad I've reached someone, thank you for sharing that with me.\n\nAs far as the sadness goes, for me it was telling me that I want a partnership beyond casual sex and the type of person I wanted it with.  I hadn't been in a relationship for several years then and was beginning to wonder if I had ever really wanted one or if I did want one, like, if it was who I was that was the reason I didn't want a relationship or if it was the women I was with.  Being with her and being sad when she left made me realize that, yes, I did want a relationship, but that I wanted it with someone who was my ideal match, and that I had an ideal match I had found who loved me, so not only did someone meet my standards, but I met theirs.  This led me to realize that it's worth holding out for.  Confidence is a big thing, and I don't think I'm alone in saying that I've been tempted to compromise just so I'm not lonely.  I do have a regular group of women I date, one with whom I would consider entering a partnership with if she wasn't moving at the end of the year, but with her aside, I have chose not to enter a relationship with any of those women because they don't meet all my needs, and I'm going to wait until one does.\n\nIt's good that you know yourself, like I said, everyone's different, so if you're not looking for just to get laid, then be true to yourself.  Now, I would like to clarify, I do think it would be a good idea to have a casual connection with someone.  That doesn't mean that it's just about sex or that you're \"rebounding\", but having someone to go get dessert with, see a movie, etc. can work wonders.\n\nGetting over my thoughts was hard.  A lot of it comes down to time.  A lot of it comes down to just forcing yourself to date.  Like when I went through a bout of depression, I had to just force myself out of bed one day.  I realized nobody would come pull me out of bed and put me on my feet, I had to do it myself, even if it was hard.  I got out of bed for a little bit that day, then a little more the next, etc, even when I didn't want to.\n\nYou can also date without having sex.  For me and where I'm at now, the seduction community is too focused on sex and planning dates that revolve around sex.  There's nothing wrong with planning a date during the middle of the day, and I think this would be better for you because it would allow you to get out of the house, practice your conversation skills and meeting new people, but you wouldn't be worried about \"what if she wants to have sex and I don't?\"  Get some fro-yo, boba-tea, or something in a busy part of town with some shops.  You guys can talk over the fro-yo or tea, then there'll be enough places to go check out together that it should move naturally.  Antique/thrift stores are awesome for this.\n\nSo, take this into consideration, it's not law, so if it doesn't work for you, no sweat, but this is what I would advise you (also, was this very recent and a wife or something where your family and friend network are involved?  Because then, yeah, you might want to be dl for a month or two).  Get on Tinder, practice talking to complete strangers, and just make some fun dates for the middle of the day when you're both free.  No \"drinks on a Saturday night,\" just very low-key and laid-back.\n\nAlso, if I didn't answer any questions or didn't understand what you were asking, or if you have more, write me any time.

It still would have made living at home with my folks a drag (nothing can take the bitterness out of swallowing that frog), but it would have helped me realize that I wasn't worthless, I was just living and constantly improving, even if I couldn't tell at the time.\n\nAside from that, some people seem to be rubbed a little the long way by my \"Stay in school!

Here's a great article about having a minimal wardrobe that really changed my perspective on what it could mean to dress well.  I had kind of been discouraged cause I had heard a lot of \"every man should own a suit!\" and I couldn't afford one, but reading this and watching the videos shows how your wardrobe should reflect you and gives you ideas on how to do that with quality items without spending too much: http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/11/21/how-to-build-a-minimal-wardrobe-video/\nCombined with a good haircut and working out/watching your diet just a bit, you'll be unstoppable!

We decided we weren't feeling it, signed the papers no lawyers involved, and got a beer to celebrate)\n\nDude, take a moment every single day for the rest of your life to count your blessings and thank god that it went down this well. Let me tell you how divorce ended for one of my friends:\n\nHe met his wife in college, they fell madly in love and got married, then had a couple kids. She was his beautiful dream woman and he would do anything for her, and he did. At first they were content and happy, but then she quit her job and started expecting a cushy life. After a while, this expectation turned into a demand. He worked 60-80 hour work weeks to provide a good life to her and her kids, while she sat at home, shopped online and gained a hundred pounds. He busted his fucking ass for 8 years for her. And how did she repay him? She decided to start fucking the neighbor.\n\nSo she started to conspire with her lawyer. How much could they get out of a divorce? She cleverly gathered evidence against him to show \"emotional hardship\" due to the fact that he was away from home working so much. Then she slams him with the divorce papers, and he's so blind-sided by it, he has no time to prepare any defense. Not to mention the fact that now he has to pay for HER lawyer, he's pulling even more work hours, and has barely enough money to hire his own. Imagine working until midnight, knowing those dollars you're earning are going to a lawyer who's job it is to take MORE of your money. It's just absolutely insane.\n\nSuffice it to say, he got fucked hard in court. She took most of his assets, and he now has to hand over half of his take-home salary to her every month for the next decade. She got the house, she has a new boyfriend living there, she doesn't have to work. The law has decided that a fair outcome to this is that he be a slave to his fat ex wife for the foreseeable future, while she sits at home being a fat lazy cunt who's only contribution to society is comes out of her ass in the form of vapor. And now, he's a shell of the man he used to be; depressed, hopeless, and looks like a 50-year old even though he's barely in his 30's.", "id": "d4u7kxq"}, {"comment": "Oh I know man, it worked out so so good.

Don\u2019t invest in a woman who isn\u2019t invested in you.\n\nDisagree with a hard time limit like this, though. \n\nSure, don't start off with romantic stuff.  But a lot of thoughtful stuff falls under the category of \"romantic,\" and a lot of that stuff is fine sooner than three months.  And if she's invested sooner, you're fine with that, and everything feels good.... there's little reason to hold to some arbitrary timeline.  \n\nProvided one still observes their boundaries, of course.\n\n> 3.Continue to Approach Other Women.\n\nMan, this one is tricky.  It's good to know that you're desirable but on the other hand, it's problematic to be beholden to the validation of women in order to know you have abundance.  This is the very trap that many veterans, including Style, have fallen into. \n\nIt's a difficult line to walk.  Style had to seek therapy for years to fix himself after going with the \"always approaching\" mindset.

Maybe not so good.\n\nAnd it's a small world; as /u/asliceobread mentioned, if your approaching gets back to your GF, that would easily be seen a breach of trust.\n\n_______________________________\n\n**In any case, a more balanced approach of interacting with everyone positively and not simply focusing on approaching women, is probably better in the long run.**  There are ways to stay in touch with your own desirability without falling in a pit.  \n\nI'd add that things like social partner dancing are great for this concept of knowing your own desirability and options.

Others, like you, prefer to whine on here. Have you looked at the sidebar? Have you tried fixing your social skills? Have you ASKED a girl out? Have you learned to keep your negative perception of yourself under control? Why do you think confidence is the single most common word thrown around here?\n\n>and then how he discusses, as if it is a fact, that men need to be successful in \"all areas\" of life because that's the equivalent of a \"woman's looks.\" He does try to qualify it by saying \"few men can succeed in all those areas\" but really it just seems to be a dance around what appears to be a very RedPill way of looking at things: in other words, social status, good career, full independence, or forget about it.\n\nWomen like more things in men than men do in women. It's even a common joke about \"Men: Is she hot, bro? vs Women: How tall is he/how much does he earn/how fit is he/how smart is he/etc?\". This means that men can get away with having only one or two good areas, and just need to make a move (and for fuck's sake, don't go on about being a \"loser\"). Women are either hot, or they are screwed. In fact, Woujo makes that same point, although he ties it in with a bunch of feminist shit that I disagree with (another thing - STOP CARING WHAT A BUNCH OF GUYS ON REDDIT SAY. TALK TO WOMEN. EXERCISE YOUR SOCIAL MUSCLE, AND YOU WILL GET BETTER).\n\nThere is also nothing wrong with trying to improve yourself, FOR yourself, and not because you want to pick up girls. YOU CAN DRAW - LEVERAGE THAT SHIT. Do you know how many artists get laid regularly? Why do you limit yourself to working at checkout? Aim better, for fuck's sake. You can do it, I believe in you, if no-one else will.

If conversation gets awkward because you are not socially fluent, own the fact that you're autistic. Unless the woman is a total bitch, she won't make fun of you for it, and for several women, this won't even deter them. Also, see above. I won't accept your self-limiting bullshit. Get off reddit, get on Khan Academy, and brush up on your maths skills. Then download Maya for 3D modelling, and learn to make masterpieces. Develop your drawing hobby more. Get out and go to a dance class to learn to touch women. Take up a martial art. Go to improvisation or even public speaking classes. Talk to almost everyone you meet, go online on a music lover chat room, and make some online friends. Get on Steam, and make some gamer friends, they are sympathetic enough to social outcasts to help them become non-social outcasts, and just the right level of meme-spouting autism so you'll fit right in. LIVE, MAN!\n\nThen report to me by next month via PM on what you have done. Screw it, I shall be your taskmaster, and you shall be my workhorse. I'll make a champion and a Don Juan out of you yet. So you'll get girls, AND you won't die under a bridge.\n\n>In other words I'm continuing to struggle with contradictions, the \"status is a must, be a prize or forget it\" vs. \"any guy can get laid as long as he improves his social skills, learns to show confidence, and approach.\" Most depressingly, in most discussions here about the 30+ population of men, the \"be a prize\" angle is pushed more than the latter, more optimistic angle.\n\nWHY DO YOU CARE WHAT A BUNCH OF GUYS ON SEDDIT, WHO CAN'T EVEN AGREE WITH ONE ANOTHER HALF THE TIME, SAY? What do your eyes tell you? That an autistic, middle-aged weirdo can get laid, provided he owns the fact that he has a functional pair of balls, and some self-belief in his ability to do better, or that the world works like a coin-operated, drink dispenser machine?\n\nTake my advice: Go outside, build your social skills, and ask women out. Don't let your self-limiting bullshit overpower you, none of that \"loser\" talk. Shit, get on NoFap for at least 30 days minimum, this might actually help you a lot. And finally, work on yourself so you don't die like a dog. That last one is for you only, and I would argue, the most important thing of all.\n\n>In other words I need to figure out how to look at things.

Before we had culture, it was still generally males pursuing females. Why? Because males are fertile all the time, but females are only availably fertile until they get pregnant. If the males can mate every day, and the females only mate for a couple times and then take months to carry a baby and more months to raise it, then 1) there are going to be more males than females looking to mate at any given time, and 2) the females need to be more careful in deciding with whom to mate, because it's a greater investment for them. So we have a market where men pursue women, and women usually sit back and choose. \n\nImportantly, even though birth control methods now take away the \"greater investment\" for women, our brains are still wired to have the same urges: for men, an urge to pursue and impress (seduce) many women; for women, an urge to be pursued by many men and choose the best out of them all.\n\nWe can act against these urges - human psychology is incredibly variable.

She is 28 years old, and getting a bit past the \"bar scene\" and certainly doesn't get hit on a lot now, being removed from that social scene.\n\nUnfortunately for Dave, Emily has a boyfriend at home and isn't the type to mess around outside of a relationship, but has had her day flattered by him. But the positive interaction with the girl has improved his confidence in his game.\n\nSetting Two\n----------------\n\n7 o'clock on a Friday night, Dave sees a girl at his favorite trendy bar (you know the one that opened up last year with 20 different micro brews) alone waiting for the bartender to get her drink.\n\"Excuse me, I know this is kind of random but I think you're cute and wanted to meet you.\"\n\nRose, the girl he is talking to, looks him up and down and says, \"No offense, but You're really not my type\"\n\nRose is 29, she has been around the block a few times, and isn't very receptive to simple advances like this.

Natural is the best way.\nThe only reason I suggested clarifying is sometimes if you're just starting out / anxious you might feel you need reassurance / certainty before you act. I sometimes did, especially when a girl one time asked me whether she could bring a friend. I replied 'No lol, it's a date!'. Even if you do clarify, it should be playful anyway.\n\n\nWith you, I'm assuming the girl you like knows you like her. You probably have a gut feeling whether she likes you too. We often give girls less credit than they deserve on picking up signals. Build up the comfort in the interaction, flirt and make sure the conversation isn't always in the friend-zoney type. Kino. \n\n\nYou could also be subtle that it's a date. I often pay for coffee for the girl, so when I pay, I'll say to her 'I think the man should pay for the first date. Don't worry about it. You can get next time ;).' and pay. That way there is no doubt she knows what's up. You could try that. If she misunderstood then the onus is on her to say that. From then on assume a date unless she corrects you.\n\n\nMy embarrassing moments happened because we both weren't on the same page. Ensuring you're on the same page can still be subtle though; no girl likes being put on the spot.\n\n\nLastly try to pick a place whether you can sit next to a girl and not opposite.

It can be difficult. For me my depression was horrible, I could never even contemplate happiness no matter how hard I tried. Everything seemed so bleek and pointless, it's a feeling I can't ever REALLY describe other than darkness.\n\nBut if there was one thing that I learned about depression or bad times is they never last. YOU have complete control of your life, no matter how crazy it is. One of the best quotes I think I've ever heard was said by the only guy with one nut (Lance Armstrong) \n\n\"Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever.\"\n\n\nI like to think of my life this way. Depression if I let it would have lasted forever, I probably would be dead right now If I let it overtake me.

For those months of pain whether it be crying in my room on my birthday, or running and pushing myself at the gym, or even getting hurt by the people I loved...

The formula to lose weight is easy but the execution is difficult.\n\nFor me it was to STOP making excuses for everything and TAKE complete control of ANYTHING I CAN control and never try to worry about things I can't. So I assumed if I put in the work, suffered the disgusting meals :p, and was consistent that this would result in me losing weight. I ended up losing about 30-40 pounds that first month and it slowed down from there. I just ate really lean and worked out 5 times a week as well as run. Matter of fact, this exact principle is exactly how I approach woman.\n\nI approach with the mentality that I accept the person that I am. Therefore I can control my habits, the way i look, dress, talk, those are things I took control of. I am not going to go crazy for a girl that hates my guts, because that's something I can't control. If she doesn't want to accept me for my horrible humor :p, or my personality she has the right to and I hold no grudges. Just like she has a choice in the men she talks to, I have a choice in the PLENTY of woman out there willing to meet guys. \n\n\nI know the most generic thing to say is \"if i can do it you i can do it\" but to be perfectly honest I'm just an average guy. I truly believe EVERYONE has the potential, the only difference if work ethic. No one is a \"natural\" at anything, you can't be THAT good just because you're born that way. It requires HARD work and failure for us to reach that point where we all want to be. I truly believe the best things in life are EARNED and not given. Same thing with any kind of skill.\n\n\nHmm to answer your question about the book there was ONE book that completly just changed my mentality. It as ...Models: Attract Women Through Honesty by Mark Manson.

You can find good clothes for cheap at for example uniqlo. The reason for my buying new clothes besides me losing weight was because I felt that my idea of who I WAS needed to reflect internally as well as externally. For me dressing in nice fitted clothes felt amazing and it boosted my confidence. Fashion in all honesty is a reflection of who you are. Don't alter your \"style\" based on societies perception of \"sexy\". As long as your confident, dressed in fitted clothes, groom yourself right, doesn't matter if you're wearing a $600 shirt. The WRONG type of woman you meet are into that :p, well not wrong but not my type. I've noticed to me the more confident I was and happy with my clothes it heavily affected my mentality as well when communicating with other people.\n\n\nThe difference by the way is HUGE.

I thought if I lost the weight things would get better and maybe my ex at the time would've taken me back. But luckily and for the better things went the complete opposite.\n\n\nDuring my depression it was extremely hard to be happy. I was ALWAYS pessimistic about anything, happiness just wasn't possible.. and I LITERALLY MEAN IMPOSSIBLE. \n\n\nAfter working on myself I started to realize the improvement started to be about making friends... but eventually it was about getting rid of negativity and pessimism. Friends and family come and go, I've learned that the hard way....... really hard. They say your friends are a reflection of YOU, and at the time I was a shitty person.. i had shitty friends/family. I had to realize MY OWN self worth and due to that it reflects onto the people I am with. \n\n\nEven now I am improving every day, and that's due to me just wanting to challenge myself and take myself out of my comfort zone. Whether it be weight loss, eating, woman, or training I take the same mentality. I do EVERYTHING I can that I can control, and let every that I can't control take it's place. If it doesn't work out, I can't be mad because I did everything I could. \n\n\nSo to finally answer it at least for now... my improvement is based on me conquering my fears and challenging myself.

Friend? Party? Cold-approach?) \n\nFor instance, I can think of situations where I've been so in state that I had said nothing other than 'I fucking **LOVE** purple' - garbage right? But you can be completely certain, she knew I had a penis, from my body language & general subcommunications. \n\nSo I would recommend you keep that mantra in mind, and ask yourself:\n\n***'Does she know I have a penis?'***\n\nCheers\n", "id": "d4ys1cn"}, {"comment": "It's maybe a bit nitpicky but since this is one of my favorite areas: She's not supposed to see you as a sexual *partner* but as a sexual *person* in general.\n\nThe idea is that *you* can be the person to friendzone her early and quickly if need be while *still* being an attractive, confident man to her.\n\n______\n\nAs for putting that to practice it basically includes (like most things) doing everything you'd do if she was your best male buddy while she's around.

You phrased that incredibly well.\n\nThe context of a date implies sexual undertones already, and then we contort that little dance in our minds of how it should be pursued, and how it will be interpreted, etc, etc, etc. The best way to approach it is to take all the neuroses out of it. It should arise naturally. By removing the wonder in your own mind, you actually allow yourself to handle the date better.\n\nThe best 'kisses-on-a-first-meeting' I've had were when I cold approached a girl, as the whole interaction was impromptu.

I just stop talking and look her in the eyes, grab some part of her clothing and pull her towards me ever so slightly. Then I kiss her for 5-15 seconds. \n\nNearly always works, even if the date wasn't going to well. Of course, if the date wasn't good the kiss is pretty meaningless and you'll still go your separate ways. Though I once had a Tinder date with a beautiful dentistry student, but we had nothing in common. So after a few beers I said lets leave and then I kissed her and she asked me if I wanted to come home with her. So weird because that was 0 chemistry. I guess she just wanted to get laid.

I find that bit the trickiest... will she like an unusual cocktail bar? What about something extraordinarily different like bungee jumping on the second date?

I googled a few ideas but can't find anything that suits this particular date and girl I'm taking out.

No kissing. No touching. The conversation wasn't bland and inoffensive like eating cornflakes with water. This girl has probably been alpha widowed, is probably really smart but outwardly acts stupid, and is into a superficial lifestyle of posting stupid shit on social media, cute animals, top 40s pop music, and has severe communication problems in general. They tend to have careers in finance or business, love playing games, and are extremely loyal. You have to show them your normal upfront and then show them all the weird shit you're into over time. These girls are ok if you plate them but you can't tell them or make it too obvious.\n\n2. You were too aggressive sexually and it freaked her out. In my experience, women that react like this tend to be really meek and into their careers, usually in medicine or education. You can usually get a second date from these girls and you'll have to spend some time building comfort with her. This kind of girl goes more the types of short dates you're suggesting. These girls are big believers in the friendzone. High plate shelf life. If you play it safe with these girls she'll expect you to hook up with her \"spontaneously\" on the second date. This girl you should text at 7 and invite to get a drink at 8. These girls are possessive and won't let you plate them. However you can dump them and fuck other girls and then get back together with them easily.\n\n3. There are girls who you'll have such great chemistry with that you'll end up fucking on the first date. These girls are super cool, physically attractive but usually with one minor flaw like a funky nose or thin legs, but they also are super insecure. They're the types that cheat on their boyfriend because being alone is so tremendously difficult for them. They're also really into collecting beta orbiters so be aware of that. Expect endless shit tests. These girls are totally ok with being plated.\n\n4. You have great chemistry and you really want fuck them but they'll make you wait. These girls are REALLY into you. They'll throw comfort tests at you. They'll enjoy texting you and will usually try to reschedule if plans fall trough. Their low self esteem manifests through thinking that they're not hot enough to be with you. They won't pressure you for commitment but desperately want it. If they feel like you're just toying with then they'll dump you. Don't plate them.\n\nThis forms some rough polar axises where women will fall\n\nEdit: so a sub group of type 3 (girls who fuck on the frst date) is the case where you DON'T fuck them even though they wanted you to. For them, they see this more as that you're not enough of a bad boy and they'll start to question your alpha cred. Most will give you a second try to seduce them but you need to strike while the iron is hot; they're used to ducking on the first date so they'll easily just find another dude to replace you. Whether you have sex or not, send a straightforward, sexy text (How are the bruises?) (Thanks for helping me cheat on my wife last night heh) (You had me so worked up last night. I almost couldn't control myself). You have to do this because they get a big kick out of being objectified. These girls tend to think sex=love.

There's no chemistry. No kissing. No touching. The conversation wasn't bland and inoffensive like eating cornflakes with water. This girl has probably been alpha widowed, is probably really smart but outwardly acts stupid, and is into a superficial lifestyle of posting stupid shit on social media, cute animals, top 40s pop music, and has severe communication problems in general. They tend to have careers in finance or business, love playing games, and are extremely loyal. You have to show them your normal upfront and then show them all the weird shit you're into over time. These girls are ok if you plate them but you can't tell them or make it too obvious.\n\n2. You were too aggressive sexually and it freaked her out. In my experience, women that react like this tend to be really meek and into their careers, usually in medicine or education. You can usually get a second date from these girls and you'll have to spend some time building comfort with her. This kind of girl goes more the types of short dates you're suggesting. These girls are big believers in the friendzone. High plate shelf life. If you play it safe with these girls she'll expect you to hook up with her \"spontaneously\" on the second date. This girl you should text at 7 and invite to get a drink at 8. These girls are possessive and won't let you plate them. However you can dump them and fuck other girls and then get back together with them easily.\n\n3. There are girls who you'll have such great chemistry with that you'll end up fucking on the first date. These girls are super cool, physically attractive but usually with one minor flaw like a funky nose or thin legs, but they also are super insecure. They're the types that cheat on their boyfriend because being alone is so tremendously difficult for them. They're also really into collecting beta orbiters so be aware of that. Expect endless shit tests. These girls are totally ok with being plated.\n\n4. You have great chemistry and you really want fuck them but they'll make you wait. These girls are REALLY into you. They'll throw comfort tests at you. They'll enjoy texting you and will usually try to reschedule if plans fall trough. Their low self esteem manifests through thinking that they're not hot enough to be with you. They won't pressure you for commitment but desperately want it. If they feel like you're just toying with then they'll dump you. Don't plate them.\n\nThis forms some rough polar axises where women will fall\n\nEdit: so a sub group of type 3 (girls who fuck on the frst date) is the case where you DON'T fuck them even though they wanted you to. For them, they see this more as that you're not enough of a bad boy and they'll start to question your alpha cred. Most will give you a second try to seduce them but you need to strike while the iron is hot; they're used to ducking on the first date so they'll easily just find another dude to replace you. Whether you have sex or not, send a straightforward, sexy text (How are the bruises?) (Thanks for helping me cheat on my wife last night heh) (You had me so worked up last night. I almost couldn't control myself). You have to do this because they get a big kick out of being objectified. These girls tend to think sex=love.

This is a real problem because a successful woman literally cannot be with a loser. It\u2019s not just a matter of women being hypergamous \u2013 a woman who is a lawyer or accountant will not have anything in common with a guy who is a construction worker that watches pro wrestling and drinks beer with his buddies. No offense to guys with blue collar jobs \u2013 but those are just 2 different types of people.\n\nI see what you are saying, because in general, same attracts same, but saying that professional women won't have anything in common with a blue collar worker is a gross overgeneralization.  I know a construction worker who has dated a CEO.  I know an accountant who is married to a mechanic at an auto shop.  My friend who is a painter is currently dating a woman who owns and manages 5 businesses.  \n\nPeople are more than their professions and job titles.  They'll be Ms. Professional Boss at work, but when they are at home or with their friends they are totally different.

Physique, money, education level, etc.  But ultimately, they are emotional creatures and if you can connect with them on an emotional level, a lot of that goes out the window.\n\n>That guy that was the nerd in high school that started the tech company after he graduated - HE is now the alpha male and all the hot girls want him.

You still have to play all the games if you're going for younger women (low to mid 20's).  Yes what you said applies to women that are older, and if thats what you're aiming for great.  At first younger women aren't used to dating older men in general.  \"Gaming\" can be interpreted in different ways, but you still have to adhere to younger people's social conventions which is part of the game.  example:  I fucking hate texting.

Yet, most younger people these days, this is the only way to get to know one another and have conversations.. so I basically had to adjust.  \n\nAlso I highly disagree with the alpha disappears as well.

Currently taking year off to do research before med school, and my eventual goal is to work my ass off in med school to land my dream residency in orthopedic surgery.\n\nI have also been lifting seriously - 6-10 hours per week, doing both compound and isolation lifts with the early sets being low volume, high power for strength building and the later sets being high volume to reach failure.\n\nI read a lot, but I stay away from books that are purely made for entertainment - \"escapist\" literature as they are known. I read lots of classic fiction, primarily Russian lit as that's always been an interest of mine. I also read a variety of nonfiction, though primarily historical or psychological; ever since high school, I've been a huge history buff and my favorite conversations with women have been on different eras of world or American history.\n\nThis passion for history has made me very curious about the different world cultures; an offshoot of this curiosity has been a bit of an addiction with learning foreign languages. As a South Asian, I already speak 3 languages; but my goal is to add Spanish and French to the arsenal. Currently I spend several minutes a day (and it's very easy if you make use of any idle time during commutes or toilet breaks or while eating food) to refresh/strengthen my Hindi and Spanish and to learn French entirely independently and from scratch.\n\nMy desire to learn Spanish has also led me to explore Latin dance. I have been taking formal lessons in salsa and bachata and go out 2-3 nights a week to Latin bars and clubs to practice. I don't drink at all and have fairly sedentary friends/acquaintances, so this is an awesome way of meeting interesting women while also learning a nice skill. In addition to Latin dance, I also go to occasional lessons in Argentine tango, blues, swing, jazz, etc. \n\nMost of all, I constantly strive to emphasize the virtue of humility and self-criticism. For example, in a room of people, I always see myself as the most ignorant one in there but an ignoramus with a good deal of curiosity. \n\nSo yeah, I hope these things are at least somewhat in the right direction."], [1, "36 Checking in.. This is truth here. If I could go back in time and give myself advice, it would have been this.\n\nSome points I would like to add:\n\nIf you are currently in college, or highschool. Get a job, part time, doing whatever.. As he mentioned, college prepares you for shit. And quite frankly with the SJW and new wave feminist weirdness on campus, college is becoming more and more worthless.  Worthless in what you get out of it.. You still need that diploma, but don't expect to be making 50K plus straight out of college without any prior experience.  Getting a job early gives you several benefits and I believe its the single biggest thing that helped my game early on and even today:\n\nGetting a job in HS or College allows you:\n\n * Have your own spending money besides parents.\n * Early introduction to how the world ACTUALLY works.\n * RESPONSIBILITY! Jobs don't give you all the leeway that a teacher might.. There is no slacking off without consequences. (usually)\n * Jobs like retail FORCE you out of a shell and require you to learn approach skills on random people.\n * That extra money affords you more stuff, more stuff means nicer car, or better dates etc.\n * You'd be amazed at the women you can meet at the workplace.\n * At first the missing out on hanging out with friends might suck, but what you gain, and who you meet when working young will FAR out weigh that missed party on sat.\n * You will be far less likely to have to move back in with the parents after graduation, or between semesters, or when switching majors.\n\nHaving a job early prior to graduation makes you FAR FAR FAR FAR (I hire people all the time, can't understate this) more valuable than the dude with the 4.0 who used loans/grants all the way through and hadn't ever experienced a real job or responsibility.\n\nIt also means you have a head start and will most likely excel at what you do. And being damned good at what you do in the work place will pull more women than you can imagine.\n\nLook I'm not a very confident guy in straight up cold approach social situations.. But I'm a damned good IT guy and I always prided myself on keeping in shape (most IT guys don't), lifting (didn't start that till my 30s >:(  ).  So in the work place, the women in the room pick up on the fact that I really know my shit.  When you are good at what you do, that confidence is shown even if you don't realize it or didn't think you knew HOW to be confident. I've had encounters with women I never dream I would be able to pull simply because my confidence and ability at work drove them to approach me.\n\nAlso as OP pointed out, women are overtaking men in the successful office workplace.  Our parents generation of getting married in their teens early 20s just is out the window now. 30s are the norm. Often these women while in college will be tough to court and congrats if you swing them, but their focus is on their future career.  Once they have that career, they will be looking for the superstars around them.. And as OP pointed out, its not the popular jocks of the HS or college years.  Its the guy who is amazing at their job and fun to hang out with after work to \"decompress\" and self sufficient."], [1, "As a 22 years old guys who got some of the things you said through self-inspection and thought, I would like to thank you so very much.

They just can't get excited about the cool guy in high school who now has a shitty job and is struggling in life\n\nThis and everything that follows is plain and simple amazingly **wrong**. Women still are attracted to the alpha male. The hardwiring of our brains that evolution took thousands of generations to develop which involve being attracted to the strong, independant, dominant mate have not changed. If you think after 30 women are suddenly turned on by the numbers in your bank account or your degree you are positively deluding yourself. Women nowadays know they have a biological clock, they know their attraction starts to fade radically as they leave their 20s, and so even though they are sexually still attracted to the dominant alpha male, they need to find a financially and emotionally stable man to have kids with and support a family. A guy who leaves her hanging and is out banging other women and possibly fathering children who will compete with a woman and her kids for his support isnt what she wants. This is why she will be SEARCHING for a guy whose got his shit straight and may not rank up there in the attractive scale, but as far as sexual attraction? No looks and attitude will top devotion and worth 10 times out of 10. It's simply a priority shift. \"I *want* hot and sexy, but i *need* gentle and supporting.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is why divorce rates are so insanely high. AFTER a woman has children, then with the modern divorce laws which often involve alimony and child support REGARDLESS EVEN IF THE WOMAN CHEATS ON THE MAN OR DECIDES HERSELF TO LEAVE women have the option to dump the unexciting millionaire to go back to a dominant alpha and now have the support of two men. Im not sexist, it's actually how the law is setup, and what we're seeing in the statistics. This is also why dead bedroom marriages are so rampant, because either the guy has slacked and become a chump or was a chump to begin with and wasnt married for his attractive qualities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>  Most of the guys in their 30s that are partying and gaming are the dorks in high school that never got laid and are trying to make up for it now that they are adults and have money and are slightly less socially awkward.\n\nThis reeks of some kind of deep insecurity. Though likely true for a portion of men, im sure others do it because they are stuck in a relationship where the vows of marriage are not being upheld on \"fairness\" (see all of the deadbedrooms sub), that their woman changed and they are looking for a replacement (because we are human and sitting in a shitty marriage to uphold some nonexistant code of honor with society is illogical), or...taking from your post...theyre 30 and there are no rules they can do whatever yhe hell they want. The guy who realised \"hey im 30, ive always wanted to party and hookup\" can now, and again he has that right to live that life. Yeah it sucks if you know guys who left their family for that life, i'm sure some regretted it, but id also wager some *wanted* to be that person, and now theyre just doing what they want. Your interpretation of whether what theyre doing is right or wrong holds no weight in their life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know some people are going to jump on their righteous podium for thinking guys can live the life they want (with respect to women) but your righteous indignation does not change the happiness they feel for living the life they want.

This is a real problem because a successful woman literally cannot be with a loser. It\u2019s not just a matter of women being hypergamous \u2013 a woman who is a lawyer or accountant will not have anything in common with a guy who is a construction worker that watches pro wrestling and drinks beer with his buddies. No offense to guys with blue collar jobs \u2013 but those are just 2 different types of people.\n\nI see what you are saying, because in general, same attracts same, but saying that professional women won't have anything in common with a blue collar worker is a gross overgeneralization.  I know a construction worker who has dated a CEO.  I know an accountant who is married to a mechanic at an auto shop.  My friend who is a painter is currently dating a woman who owns and manages 5 businesses.  \n\nPeople are more than their professions and job titles.  They'll be Ms. Professional Boss at work, but when they are at home or with their friends they are totally different.  And all women have a data range in their head of what they think they're attracted to.  Physique, money, education level, etc.  But ultimately, they are emotional creatures and if you can connect with them on an emotional level, a lot of that goes out the window.\n\n>That guy that was the nerd in high school that started the tech company after he graduated - HE is now the alpha male and all the hot girls want him. And I don't mean that hot girls want him for his money or just because he is stable, they are actually attracted to him because HE is now the alpha male.\n\nNot necessarily.  I live in the Bay Area so I know lots of rich tech guys and tech millionaires and most of them don't have tons of hot girls clamoring for their attention. Just because you're successful doesn't mean it compensates for your lack of personality and charisma.  And that rings true for any external qualities a person may have.

I'd like to know though whether I'm spending my twenties well.\n\nI'm 23 and graduated with a decent gpa from a great school - ~3.8 in a STEM field; also got 97 %ile on my MCAT with tons of extracurricular work. Currently taking year off to do research before med school, and my eventual goal is to work my ass off in med school to land my dream residency in orthopedic surgery.\n\nI have also been lifting seriously - 6-10 hours per week, doing both compound and isolation lifts with the early sets being low volume, high power for strength building and the later sets being high volume to reach failure.\n\nI read a lot, but I stay away from books that are purely made for entertainment - \"escapist\" literature as they are known. I read lots of classic fiction, primarily Russian lit as that's always been an interest of mine. I also read a variety of nonfiction, though primarily historical or psychological; ever since high school, I've been a huge history buff and my favorite conversations with women have been on different eras of world or American history.\n\nThis passion for history has made me very curious about the different world cultures; an offshoot of this curiosity has been a bit of an addiction with learning foreign languages. As a South Asian, I already speak 3 languages; but my goal is to add Spanish and French to the arsenal. Currently I spend several minutes a day (and it's very easy if you make use of any idle time during commutes or toilet breaks or while eating food) to refresh/strengthen my Hindi and Spanish and to learn French entirely independently and from scratch.\n\nMy desire to learn Spanish has also led me to explore Latin dance. I have been taking formal lessons in salsa and bachata and go out 2-3 nights a week to Latin bars and clubs to practice. I don't drink at all and have fairly sedentary friends/acquaintances, so this is an awesome way of meeting interesting women while also learning a nice skill. In addition to Latin dance, I also go to occasional lessons in Argentine tango, blues, swing, jazz, etc. \n\nMost of all, I constantly strive to emphasize the virtue of humility and self-criticism. For example, in a room of people, I always see myself as the most ignorant one in there but an ignoramus with a good deal of curiosity. \n\nSo yeah, I hope these things are at least somewhat in the right direction.", "id": "d4kiy8i"}, {"comment": "Sounds like you're on a good path and much more self-aware than your peers.

This is truth here. If I could go back in time and give myself advice, it would have been this.\n\nSome points I would like to add:\n\nIf you are currently in college, or highschool. Get a job, part time, doing whatever.. As he mentioned, college prepares you for shit. And quite frankly with the SJW and new wave feminist weirdness on campus, college is becoming more and more worthless.  Worthless in what you get out of it.. You still need that diploma, but don't expect to be making 50K plus straight out of college without any prior experience.  Getting a job early gives you several benefits and I believe its the single biggest thing that helped my game early on and even today:\n\nGetting a job in HS or College allows you:\n\n * Have your own spending money besides parents.\n * Early introduction to how the world ACTUALLY works.\n * RESPONSIBILITY! Jobs don't give you all the leeway that a teacher might.. There is no slacking off without consequences. (usually)\n * Jobs like retail FORCE you out of a shell and require you to learn approach skills on random people.\n * That extra money affords you more stuff, more stuff means nicer car, or better dates etc.\n * You'd be amazed at the women you can meet at the workplace.\n * At first the missing out on hanging out with friends might suck, but what you gain, and who you meet when working young will FAR out weigh that missed party on sat.\n * You will be far less likely to have to move back in with the parents after graduation, or between semesters, or when switching majors.\n\nHaving a job early prior to graduation makes you FAR FAR FAR FAR (I hire people all the time, can't understate this) more valuable than the dude with the 4.0 who used loans/grants all the way through and hadn't ever experienced a real job or responsibility.\n\nIt also means you have a head start and will most likely excel at what you do. And being damned good at what you do in the work place will pull more women than you can imagine.\n\nLook I'm not a very confident guy in straight up cold approach social situations.. But I'm a damned good IT guy and I always prided myself on keeping in shape (most IT guys don't), lifting (didn't start that till my 30s >:(  ).  So in the work place, the women in the room pick up on the fact that I really know my shit.  When you are good at what you do, that confidence is shown even if you don't realize it or didn't think you knew HOW to be confident. I've had encounters with women I never dream I would be able to pull simply because my confidence and ability at work drove them to approach me.\n\nAlso as OP pointed out, women are overtaking men in the successful office workplace.  Our parents generation of getting married in their teens early 20s just is out the window now. 30s are the norm. Often these women while in college will be tough to court and congrats if you swing them, but their focus is on their future career.  Once they have that career, they will be looking for the superstars around them.. And as OP pointed out, its not the popular jocks of the HS or college years.  Its the guy who is amazing at their job and fun to hang out with after work to \"decompress\" and self sufficient.", "id": "d4kjdfg"}, {"comment": "Not any job will necessarily give you a head start. A part-time cafeteria, restaurant, library, clerk, etc. (i.e. the majority of jobs available to undergraduates and high school students) won't help you in the long run if you want to be a surgeon or engineer or lawyer. For these and many other prestigious jobs, you actually are better off spending that time getting closer to that 4.0 and doing research and volunteering on the side.\n\nHaving said that, you're right; when you truly know your stuff for your career, you not only get genuine respect from everyone but women noticing that are strongly magnetized to you.", "id": "d4lfo76"}], [{"comment": "As a 22 years old guys who got some of the things you said through self-inspection and thought, I would like to thank you so very much.

They just can't get excited about the cool guy in high school who now has a shitty job and is struggling in life\n\nThis and everything that follows is plain and simple amazingly **wrong**. Women still are attracted to the alpha male. The hardwiring of our brains that evolution took thousands of generations to develop which involve being attracted to the strong, independant, dominant mate have not changed. If you think after 30 women are suddenly turned on by the numbers in your bank account or your degree you are positively deluding yourself. Women nowadays know they have a biological clock, they know their attraction starts to fade radically as they leave their 20s, and so even though they are sexually still attracted to the dominant alpha male, they need to find a financially and emotionally stable man to have kids with and support a family. A guy who leaves her hanging and is out banging other women and possibly fathering children who will compete with a woman and her kids for his support isnt what she wants. This is why she will be SEARCHING for a guy whose got his shit straight and may not rank up there in the attractive scale, but as far as sexual attraction? No looks and attitude will top devotion and worth 10 times out of 10. It's simply a priority shift. \"I *want* hot and sexy, but i *need* gentle and supporting.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is why divorce rates are so insanely high. AFTER a woman has children, then with the modern divorce laws which often involve alimony and child support REGARDLESS EVEN IF THE WOMAN CHEATS ON THE MAN OR DECIDES HERSELF TO LEAVE women have the option to dump the unexciting millionaire to go back to a dominant alpha and now have the support of two men. Im not sexist, it's actually how the law is setup, and what we're seeing in the statistics. This is also why dead bedroom marriages are so rampant, because either the guy has slacked and become a chump or was a chump to begin with and wasnt married for his attractive qualities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>  Most of the guys in their 30s that are partying and gaming are the dorks in high school that never got laid and are trying to make up for it now that they are adults and have money and are slightly less socially awkward.\n\nThis reeks of some kind of deep insecurity. Though likely true for a portion of men, im sure others do it because they are stuck in a relationship where the vows of marriage are not being upheld on \"fairness\" (see all of the deadbedrooms sub), that their woman changed and they are looking for a replacement (because we are human and sitting in a shitty marriage to uphold some nonexistant code of honor with society is illogical), or...taking from your post...theyre 30 and there are no rules they can do whatever yhe hell they want. The guy who realised \"hey im 30, ive always wanted to party and hookup\" can now, and again he has that right to live that life. Yeah it sucks if you know guys who left their family for that life, i'm sure some regretted it, but id also wager some *wanted* to be that person, and now theyre just doing what they want. Your interpretation of whether what theyre doing is right or wrong holds no weight in their life.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI know some people are going to jump on their righteous podium for thinking guys can live the life they want (with respect to women) but your righteous indignation does not change the happiness they feel for living the life they want. Learn this rule as soon as possibly: **You are the judge of you**. No one else's opinion matters (within legal boundaries). Make your life what **you** want it to be.

I decided to practice on my own before trying to post again.\n\nIt went something like this- there is also a TL;DR version at the bottom-\n\nYou need to balance how much you value yourself with how much you value others. If you value others more than yourself, so you need to shift the \"value scale\" towards myself.\n\nGive up the game. If you can't be happy without a woman, you won't be happy with a woman. If you don't love yourself, no one else would love you. Picking up women will not make you feel better about yourself (in the long term) nor will you be good at it if you don't like yourself.\n\nIf you haven't been able to get any women to fuck you, go do some self improvement stuff for a few months. This guide is not for you. If you have improved yourself, seduced some women, and still feel like shit, read on!\n\nOkay, if you've gotten to this point, you aren't an overweight neckbearded geek. Women don't like these men, they prefer well dressed, socially adept, physically fit men. You're a much better version of yourself right now than you were before you started your self improvement / seduction journey. So why do you still not like yourself?\n\nNo matter how hard you work on improving yourself, you're never going to be perfect. You're always going to have flaws, have failures, and make mistakes. Everyone has flaws, has failures, and makes mistakes. You need to learn to accept yourself, flaws and all. \n\nDiscover yourself. List some personality traits that describe you. What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? If you're having trouble doing this, have a close friend help you. You need to be able to look at all of these traits and accept them, especially your weaknesses. Remember- you'll always have some weaknesses, so accept that you'll never be \"perfect\".\n\nTake some time to do stuff for yourself. If you're always doing stuff to impress other people, you've probably neglected to do stuff that you enjoy. Long walks on the beach, a couple hours of videogames, painting, playing guitar- whatever you enjoy, because YOU like it, not because SOMEONE ELSE likes it, do it!\n\nMake some great guy friends. There is something special about brotherhood; this is why men have great friendships with the men they met in their fraternities, sports teams, or military. These kinds of friends will stick with you through your highs and your lows, will accept you flaws and all, and will push you to be a better person. These friendships aren't a one way street; you have treat your friends the same way in friendships like these.\n\nTL;DR version- Give up the game, focus on valuing yourself more than others by learning to accept yourself flaws and all, doing activities/hobbies because you enjoy it, and making great guy friends.\n\nNow you're ready to go back into the game, because the game is not who you are, it is a piece of who you are. It doesn't matter if you succeed or fail, because your source of happiness isn't women, but yourself.\n\nI probably could add in my story of how this worked for me, but this is already pretty long.

Admittedly, I still feel this to some extent, but not as much. \n\nNow, I feel more comfortable with who I am and felt less of a need to try to put a false image of myself.

You seem to speak to those of us who use picking up girls as escapism deep emotional wounds, and are being exploited by the businesses in the process. While that may be true for some or even the majority of us, it not necessarily is so. And for two reasons.\n\n1) Picking up girls can be part of a healthy lifestyle. How about lifting weights? How about working hard and becoming a millionaire? How about traveling the world?  How about being insanely interested in some historical event and knowing everything about it? How about being a great online video gamer? These are all activities that are not directly beneficial for your physical or mental health (of course working out is but spending 10hrs a week lifting weights and zero cardio is not exactly the best physically). Still they may be a source of great happiness to people. Call it passion. Call it lifestyle.

I believe in God nor in the afterlife, and I think I will quickly and definitively be forgotten after my death, and I believe the earth will implode in about 4 million years and humanity will vanish from the Galaxy. This altogether makes me thing it's best to enjoy my time here, and enjoy both as many internal as external things out there. You give an example of a one night stand you had which was unfulfilling. Well guess what I had a one night stand just 3 days ago, and it was great. She spoke to me on tinder, I felt she was in for it, apparently I played it right as I got invited over to her place swiftly, and after watching a movie I banged the shit out of her. True emotionally it was nothing. True even the sex wasn't amazing as she didn't want to give me a blowjob and was being a bit to rough with me.

This will result in a higher rate of weathering of silicate minerals, which will cause a decrease in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In about 600 million years from now, the level of CO2 will fall below the level needed to sustain C3 carbon fixation photosynthesis used by trees. Some plants use the C4 carbon fixation method, allowing them to persist at CO\n2 concentrations as low as 10 parts per million. However, the long-term trend is for plant life to die off altogether.

When she starts complaining, don't play along. You've got all sorts of ways to do that...\n\n1. Listen to it, give a nonanswer like \"huh, weird\" and change the topic/let that topic fizzle out. You just have nothing to add on that thread so don't encourage it.\n2.

You aren't their hardcore life friend and it's not your duty to hear the negative things going on in their life or fix it. This goes for both men and women in your life.\n\nIf it weren't a pretty girl, you'd probably be weirded out by a person you thought of as a new friend opening up to you and complaining/detailing all sorts of personal shit in their lives and asking for your advice. When I am hanging out with someone, I do it because we can make each other feel happy and good in the moment. Hanging out is about mutual fun, not mutual therapy. No one should be there to absorb the negative shit from the other. And later, if I develop a strong enough connection with someone -- enough familiarity and friendship, we'll probably get to the point where we complain to each other about some milder things. And as that relationship grows, we'll open up and share deeper complaints. That's fine... but it has to come with time and not be inappropriately soon. \n\nGuys that are bad with women can summarize most of their bad tendencies in one simple way: They act in ways that are too high in magnitude for the given context. And that comes from social inexperience.

That's a line to draw, because those are just buzzkills that friends tell each other because they're looking to decompress.

And use your sensibilities, don't just slam down on all of this type of info, people share small annoyances naturally (work was so hard!). Just don't try to be a savior when this stuff hits the line of communication. Hear it, acknowledge it, maybe ask some questions, maybe share some similar stuff you've gone through, but ultimately, you can often be a little cocky like \"Don't worry, I'll protect you now\" while smiling + eye contact or just flat out judge her in a nonserious way like \"Stop being so serious!\" (again, the mood is fun, smiling etc.)\n\nThink about it in terms of complaints women often say about men... and the men... they have one simple request, \"Why didn't you JUST TELL ME?!\" A typical example might be a guy kissing a girl that doesn't want it but literally shows no sign. She maybe says something the next day about it, the guy feels awful, and he wonders, \"Why didn't you communicate???\"\n\nSimilarly, if you aren't feeling a line of communication that's developing, *you* can communicate that too. And it doesn't have to be hardcore, awkward, and serious. It can be lighthearted, but the onus is on *you* to communicate. Why didn't YOU communicate?? And, again, that can be communicated as a matter of fact by just changing the topic, shutting it down with a charismatic end point, or by directly talking about it.", "id": "d5upy7t"}, {"comment": "100s of sources and explanations on the supreme importance of listening.

Anytime I found myself thinking/stressing about something I shouldn't be thinking/stressing over I forced myself to change thoughts. I started thinking immediately about playing my guitar, playing a video game I liked, anything that I derived pleasure from. I made myself change my thought process immediately. I still do that to this day. It becomes second nature ad very easy after a while. When you find yourself obsessing over some girl, stop it. Think about something else, do something else, the more you love whatever it is the easier it is to do. MAKE YOURSELF DO IT FROM THIS POINT FORWARD IN YOUR LIFE.
