First off I'll ad my edit came off a little more condescending then I really intended it too. I just got a lot of the same question that felt like it was coming from people who didn't really understand the frustration of having to do repetitive things like this and therefore didn't understand the point of the pencil. But for exactly that reason it's also a fair question, so my bad. I take it back.\n\nOn to my answer. Firstly artists vary widely in their technique, tool requirements, and what just simply annoys the shit out of them. So this is my answer as someone who hates sharpening their mechanical pencil and feeling like im wasting lead. Ill add this pencil may eat through lead worse or about the same, but at least i dont have to see it happening. \n\nObviously you *can* do the same thing more or less that this pencil does yourself, but it theoretically presents a simpler way to do it. Like another commentor pointed out the way most artists who use mechanical pencils will \"sharpen the tip\" is by scratching onto another piece of paper. Not by rotating while you draw. There's two ways I can think of to even do that. 1) you would have to actually rotate your wrists to get this rolling effect while drawing a line. The motion it would take to continously sharpen your lead like that would mess up your line work at the very least, and be over all very awkward. 2) you could rotate the pencil inbetween every line you draw. Not only would it be rather hard to break that habit in and remember to do that, there's still another problem with that. If you are drawing a line then rotating it and drawing another line, then rotating until your tip is sharp again then in those moments you aren't using a sharpened tip to draw all those lines in the first place. Assuming it takes 4 repeated motions or so of line drawing then rotating to get a sharp tip then you get 1 sharp line for every 4. And if you need ALL your lines to be sharp then you may as well do that scratching thing on another peice of paper instead. The difference i would say in having a pencil that continue to rotate and sharpen on its own is it probably only takes about 1 line to get it sharp. So this cuts out the argument for rotating your pencil on your own as a comparison and leaves it comparable to to the action of scratching it another peice of paper. Except it replaces that manuel action therefore being the best option arguably.\n\n\nThat being said I'll admit it's not some crazy revelation. In fact to most people it probably seems like such a benign difference, like why the fuck bother to order a pencil just for that? Pretty much anybody could live without it. Fair enough, I find it annoying enough to think it's an awesome improvement, but honestly unless you draw faces roughly a little bigger than your fingernail like I do, you won't be missing out if you dont buy it. \n\nBut what does confuse me is people who are focusing on the price. 15$ is not expensive for an art pencil. Period. I paid 20 dollars for my art pencil mostly because I liked the grip and the weight. It doesn't have any special features at all. So to pay 15 dollars for a pencil that could potentially cut out a  slightly annoying part of the routine, to me is like *why not give it a try?*. Art is expensive. If you thought this pencil was awesome but only the price was stopping you I'd just have to scratch my head a little bit because art is a decidely expensive hobby. Again this varies by artists, and is more akin to picking your battles. If you explore an artist who says mostly draws with ball point pens you will still probably find he has some other expensive art supplies. Or an expensive drafting table, etc. But I can also understand how people may find the pencil to be of pointless use to them and so the price leaves them feeling like it's even more of a rip off.\n\nTl;Dr My edit came off dickish, my bad.

The same sort of cancer risk you get from eating grilled meat or anything that gets blackened/charred.  We roast our in an oven, no smoke involved.  Here's an excerpt I've found:\n\n\"The cancer risk, if it exists, may be due to the fact that mat\u00e9 contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), compounds that are known to be carcinogenic. One study found very high concentrations of these in yerba mat\u00e9 leaves and in both hot and cold infusions of them. (Tobacco smoke and grilled meat also contain PAHs.)\n\nOn the positive side, some research suggests that drinking mat\u00e9 preserves bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, although the investigators described these findings as preliminary. And a study from the University of Illinois suggested that bioactive compounds found in one cup of the tea can disrupt colon cancer cells, at least in the lab. The researchers reported that caffeine derivatives in the tea damaged cancer cell DNA causing the cells to self-destruct. However, no human studies have linked drinking yerba mat\u00e9 to a lower risk of colon cancer.\"\n\n\nIncidentally, yaupon has also been studied by the University of A&M as a preventative for colon cancer.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.drweil.com/health-wellness/body-mind-spirit/cancer/can-yerba-mate-tea-cause-cancer/\n\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/yerba-mate/faq-20058343", "id": "d728959"}], [{"comment": "What does it taste like?", "id": "d728ftk"}, {"comment": "The Light Roast...

We harvest our yaupon in the Lost Pines Forest of Bastrop, Texas were 5 years ago the 6th most damaging wildfire in U.S. history burnt down almost 5,000 acres of forest and hundreds of homes.  Now the yaupon is growing back faster than the pine trees and threatening to turn the whole area into a yaupon/post oak thicket.  Harvesting yaupon helps the pine forest grow back and also helps reduce future wildfire fuel.  In addition to that the property we're currently harvesting from is getting a wildlife tax exemption for removing yaupon to help restore habitat for the Houston Toad, the first amphibian ever added to the federal endangered species list.\n\nWe also didn't want to add to the world's waste stream so all of our packaging is recyclable/compostable/biodegradable.  \n\nAs you can see I'm pretty passionate about yaupon and the environment.

So, if your tub can't hold you and your gf/bf taking a shower together, it can't hold that extra water. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, the opening where a tub is cut--along with plumbing walls and floor systems in bathrooms--are required to have sufficient sister-ed beams, headers, footers, etc. due to the extra weight and pipes in the wall. Most apartments try their hardest to stack plumbing (bathrooms, kitchens, etc) rooms on top of each other for cost purposes. This also means those walls and floors are stronger. (This is why one reason they tell you to hide in the bathroom during storms.)\n\n\n\n\nSo, in short, there's no reason not to use it in the bathroom since the extra strain is more than adequately supported by a floor/wall system. \n\n\n\nSource: I'm in school for Architectural Engineering and work as an Operations Manager for a construction company.

Being in a cold environment and applying heat to the outside of one part of your body is very different.  \n\nMy source is years and years (probably more than you've been alive) of outdoor winter activities, first aid and rescue training for those activities, along with degrees in biology and biochemistry. I suppose applying heat to the core is better than the extremities which will always have a negative affect on raising body temperature as it will pull blood away from the core and to the surface of the extremities. However, most of your bodies heat generation comes from the core. If you are cold, you body is going to pull the blood into the core and minimize circulation to the extremities. If you apply heat anywhere to the outside of the body, you are pulling blood away from the core and fooling your body into thinking it is warm, counteracting the bodies natural heating mechanism and activating the cooling mechanism which opens pores, draws blood to the surface, and pumps blood to extremities. You will most definitely feel warm, but in reality your body temperature could be dropping which is extremely dangerous.  \n\nIf you heat internally or keep your core well insulated, as the core heats, it will spread that heat throughout the body with circulation. Ever hear the saying \"if your feet are cold, put on a hat?\" We know now that most body heat is lost through the chest and back, but that saying comes from the same principle of getting the core to warm the extremities.  \n\nThe article you linked to is about cooling and healing the body.

Drilled with holes for the mushroom plug, sealed with beeswax, and left to \"season\" for five yrs in order for the \"mushroom seed\" or sillium (not sure of the spelling) to spread through out the log. Once thats done, they were set up, leaning against horizontal poles, with lots of shaded cover (the forest).\n\nTo make the mushrooms grow each log had to be flipped over, end over end, hammered with a sledge hammer, (breaks up and shocks the sillium), water heavily for 24 hrs, cover with clear plastic sheets (creates a green house effect). The plastic would be taken off and exposed to the sun. Mushrooms would grow and be ready for sale in three days. There was a section for every day of the week.
