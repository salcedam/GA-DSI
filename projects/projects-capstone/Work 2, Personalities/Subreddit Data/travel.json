When all is said and done, the guy actually works all the time, but somehow doesn't consider most of it \"work\".

Give me a choice between an average 3 star hotel (found on hotwire) for $50/night, or a more social (well rated) hostel, and I'll chose the hostel every time. I love food, but some of the best food I've had in country is found in the streets/cheaper areas. I'd much rather spend several days soaking in the vibe of Rome than pay $30+ for a bus tour of the city.\n\nBut that's not to say mine is the only way. Travel is like everything else, it falls into the time-quality-cost triangle. You must choose one to sacrifice. Want to maximise your once in a lifetime brief trip to Europe - it's gonna cost you. Want to live for a long time for cheap - you're going to be in relative poverty. Want to have a great time and eat at the fanciest places - you won't be doing it for long!\n\nI try to choose a middle ground. I won't splurge on a hotel, but I choose a decent hotel. I won't eat tomato pasta for weeks, but I will find the good local places, and avoid the high end eateries. I will go into museums/entrance to places, but I'll be selective what I want to do. This may be the trip of the lifetime for some, but that doesn't mean you can be stupid with your money!\n\nAs for dirt cheap travel, it's entirely doable. Sorta. I stayed in Kerala for ~$10/night for everything bar the flights out there. In East Europe, $20-30/night is doable when a reasonable level of luxury. If you couch surf (not guaranteed, but quite feasible in big cities), costs melt away to very little. If you hitch hike (not ridiculous option in some countries), costs dramatically fall to. I spent 2 months in SE Asia last year, didn't compromise on my quality of life one bit, partied hard, achieved everything I wanted to do and it cost less than <$3k. $2k without flights. I kept very detailed records of my expenses (I'm a nerd), and I can see I was very wasteful. I probably could knock 25% off if I did it again without affecting my trip in any way, but I have no regrets!\n\nLast thing though - as great as cheaping it out is, you would have to be a fool to rely on it. Things do go wrong, emergencies come up, opportunities arise and if you don't have a sizeable slush fund (~$1k), you are an absolute fool. Even if you're comfortable returning home with absolutely no money, you can spend this emergency cash: the last few weeks with minimal risk. But I've met people with the tightest budgets who failed to include the cost of a cheap flight to Vietnam/Berlin/wherever (enduring wonderful 2 day bus rides instead), or worse, chose these in error and had to somehow make these savings in their already threadbare budgets. I've lost count of the people I met who looked on the brink of scurvy/dysentery from the ramen and local water diet, just because they couldn't budget. Don't do it, add $1k as your emergency funds and treat yourself from time to time. Being cheap is only fun when it is a choice, not forced upon you!"], [18, "This definitely needed to be said, so thanks for writing this out! \n\nI always get slightly annoyed when I see blog posts and articles claiming that you can travel for free.

And sometimes great things are expensive. But they can have huge value /money. After certain limits you start to cut your experiences, not just budget. Figure out what is most valuable for you and try to spend your money there. Cut something that you don't value. For example I really like road trips so I rent cars everywhere (which is not cheap). I don't really care about fancy restaurants or luxurious lodging so I save there.\n\nAmbitious ultrabudget travels can just turn into checklist mission: \"stood under Eiffel tower\", \"saw Statue of Liberty (from 1km)\".

Hitchhiking relies on the kindness of strangers, but not (read: to a negligible extent) on their money. Yes, people might need 5% more gas because of you, but really, are you willing to argue that this is a deciding factor? And contrary to others  I don't think kindness can \"wear thin\" if you always offer kindness in return as well. The willingness to be kind is built through positive encounters; the very same you make constantly when you're hitchhiking.  \n* **Sleep**: wild camping / couchsurfing and similar stuff. Couchsurfing is again a kindness-thing. I view it as similar to hitchhiking. In the end you're not *taking* anything *from* anybody. You're even giving something as well, even if it's just company & stories. If kindness wore out & was as onesided as some make it out to be, people would stop hosting others for free.

Many walking tours are free.\n\nI don't know which specific budgets we are alluding to and I am sure some of them are not very accurate. You will have to tone down the luxury and cut down on certain things. But it can still be great. And you can have a great travel experience on a limited budget. Those who have done so can often be found doing so again and again throughout their lives.

Personally, I like cheaping it out, to some extent at least. Give me a choice between an average 3 star hotel (found on hotwire) for $50/night, or a more social (well rated) hostel, and I'll chose the hostel every time. I love food, but some of the best food I've had in country is found in the streets/cheaper areas. I'd much rather spend several days soaking in the vibe of Rome than pay $30+ for a bus tour of the city.\n\nBut that's not to say mine is the only way. Travel is like everything else, it falls into the time-quality-cost triangle. You must choose one to sacrifice. Want to maximise your once in a lifetime brief trip to Europe - it's gonna cost you. Want to live for a long time for cheap - you're going to be in relative poverty. Want to have a great time and eat at the fanciest places - you won't be doing it for long!\n\nI try to choose a middle ground. I won't splurge on a hotel, but I choose a decent hotel. I won't eat tomato pasta for weeks, but I will find the good local places, and avoid the high end eateries. I will go into museums/entrance to places, but I'll be selective what I want to do. This may be the trip of the lifetime for some, but that doesn't mean you can be stupid with your money!\n\nAs for dirt cheap travel, it's entirely doable. Sorta. I stayed in Kerala for ~$10/night for everything bar the flights out there. In East Europe, $20-30/night is doable when a reasonable level of luxury. If you couch surf (not guaranteed, but quite feasible in big cities), costs melt away to very little. If you hitch hike (not ridiculous option in some countries), costs dramatically fall to. I spent 2 months in SE Asia last year, didn't compromise on my quality of life one bit, partied hard, achieved everything I wanted to do and it cost less than <$3k. $2k without flights. I kept very detailed records of my expenses (I'm a nerd), and I can see I was very wasteful. I probably could knock 25% off if I did it again without affecting my trip in any way, but I have no regrets!\n\nLast thing though - as great as cheaping it out is, you would have to be a fool to rely on it. Things do go wrong, emergencies come up, opportunities arise and if you don't have a sizeable slush fund (~$1k), you are an absolute fool. Even if you're comfortable returning home with absolutely no money, you can spend this emergency cash: the last few weeks with minimal risk. But I've met people with the tightest budgets who failed to include the cost of a cheap flight to Vietnam/Berlin/wherever (enduring wonderful 2 day bus rides instead), or worse, chose these in error and had to somehow make these savings in their already threadbare budgets. I've lost count of the people I met who looked on the brink of scurvy/dysentery from the ramen and local water diet, just because they couldn't budget.

Just a short rebuttal on your main points:\n\n(note I'm not saying you should or shouldn't do any of these things nor that you'd like them, but there are people who do)  \n\n*  **Transportation**: Hitchhiking/ cycling. Hitchhiking relies on the kindness of strangers, but not (read: to a negligible extent) on their money. Yes, people might need 5% more gas because of you, but really, are you willing to argue that this is a deciding factor? And contrary to others  I don't think kindness can \"wear thin\" if you always offer kindness in return as well. The willingness to be kind is built through positive encounters; the very same you make constantly when you're hitchhiking.  \n* **Sleep**: wild camping / couchsurfing and similar stuff. Couchsurfing is again a kindness-thing. I view it as similar to hitchhiking. In the end you're not *taking* anything *from* anybody. You're even giving something as well, even if it's just company & stories. If kindness wore out & was as onesided as some make it out to be, people would stop hosting others for free. Same goes for picking up hitchhikers.\n* \"**medical bills**\": not an issue in Europe, or anywhere else where you're properly insured. (no offence & I'm sorry for everybody who has to worry about this. You shouldn't have to!)\n* \"**extra fees you get for going overweight with your baggage**\": Some people don't fly at all. \n\nAnd don't forget that costs depend largely on the country/region. People might just choose to travel to cheap places.\n\nI have travelled on ridiculously low budgets and had the time of my life. Not saying it's for everybody, but it is possible.

There was a creek with really clear, drinkable water, a small oasis & a lake. We stayed for a few days & hiked up to a nearby waterfall where we could bathe in the water.\n\nSo basically authentic local food, good conversations teaching us about the culture and a nice hike with a swim in amazing nature, all for the cost of food. And our host didn't have to pay for us either. We shared all our food and everybody got some good company out of it.\n\nOther examples include camping next to a beautiful river with turtles in it for three days & cooking on fire (more of a nature holiday), and exploring Istanbul, which, admittedly, was a little more expensive.

And my first question would be where you have traveled to yourself.\n\nIt is no secret that a true shoestring budget (of which I am not advocating or defending, but solely purporting its existence) will have to omit certain things. You can't do the fancy tours. You can't eat out every meal. You can't stay at the Ritz Carlton. But you can eat local fare, which is often cheapest. In places as varying as Vietnam, Greece, and Ecuador these meals can be as little as $2 USD or less. Many hostels have a work/stay program. Many walking tours are free.\n\nI don't know which specific budgets we are alluding to and I am sure some of them are not very accurate. You will have to tone down the luxury and cut down on certain things. But it can still be great. And you can have a great travel experience on a limited budget. Those who have done so can often be found doing so again and again throughout their lives. It's not for everyone, but it's rewarding, and it's demonstrably possible. \n\nOtherwise, people wouldn't do it.  \n\nBest of luck with travel endeavors and feel free to PM me if you have any questions on specifics.

They belong to everyone for everyone's enjoyment. \n\n>The least you can do is respect places of spiritual significance to them.\n\nI will, up until they attempt to bar be from experiencing the natural site on the basis of emotion. \n\n\nYou want to come into my church, Synagogue, mosque on a day it is not in service? Have a blast, wear sandals and take pictures. I don't care, because respect is a 2 way street. You say we should \"respect\" their desire to have no one climb it. Fine then they should equally respect others desires that climbing it is literally the entire point and experience of Uluru. You find a middle ground, climbing only for part of the year, limited numbers that need approval, etc. that is mutual respect. \n\nI will happily avoid it during important events and ceremonies no questions asked, I will treat the site with respect and not damage or litter anything. But as I said respect goes both ways. Your understand that your cultural importance of this site is not universal and be willing to work with the rest of the world to reach a mutually agreeable compromise. \n\nWestminster Abbey happily allows visitors when the church isn't in use. They let people wander around wearing sandals, talking, using headphones, etc. Things that would be highly inappropriate when the Church was actually in use. In a religious context Uluru is no different than a church, both are religiously important and \"sacred.\" If the sites at Uluru are in use or in preparation I would have no qualms about staying away at all. But when it is not and it is just sitting there I will treat it differently just as I treat the church differently. \n\nThe fact you find a natural location to have \"spiritual significance\" is not a valid reason for barring others from experiencing the site fully. That applies to everyone, there are *many* things that I find offensive, but I keep my mouth shut because I understand that being offended is *my* reaction to *my* beliefs. I do not and should not expect others to bend to my religious or cultural opinions.

The same as with a church, when mass is going on I'll leave it alone. When nothing is happening I will wander around taking pictures. \n\nEating pork isn't an inherent part of experiencing a mosque. So not doing so doesn't alter your experience. Climbing Uluru **is** part of the experience for many. So a better comparison would be going to the Sistine Chapel but being told you can go inside...seeing the inside is part of the experience. \n\nEdit: yet again it seems we bust bow before some religious beliefs unquestionably but it is ok to dismiss others.

Should we listen to them as well? Of course not because it is their religious belief and thus their rules. But we are supposed to listen to this other religious \"just \"because they asked\"?\n\nTotally false analogy. If someone doesn't want you to gay marry or eat pork then they are trying to impose rules on your whole life, no matter where you are. We have been eating pork in the west for generations. If outsiders come in and start telling us to abide by *their* laws then they are entering *our* world and interfering. Same is true of christians telling atheists (or even christians of another church) who they can marry. With Uluru the opposite is true. They have been holding the site sacred for 1000's of years and suddenly we turn up in *their* world and make demands about what rules should or shouldn't apply to *their* sacred site. \n\nYou can as an outsider claim it belongs to everyone but, just as in Europe there have been rules about who owns what for generations which are generally respected the same is true for Australia. The only difference is that it wasn't written down in Australia and only now are their ownership rights being respected, something they have fought hard for for generations. You want to take a step back and start choosing certain features to be excluded from their traditional ownership rules just because this particular feature happens to be bigger and more impressive, more world record breaking, than the others? \n\nThey aren't even asking for you not to go near it! All they are calling for is respect! Which apparently is something you agree on. You agree, for example, that litter shouldn't be dropped on it. This is your western definition of how something should be respected, completely culturally conditioned by your culture. In their culture climbing it is disrespectful. In their culture not obeying the gender rules or photographing certain things is disrespectful. Respecting someone else's sacred site solely according to your western definition of what is or isn't respectful is *not* being respectful at all. What you see as logical is just what conforms to your culture rather than theirs..\n\nDo you show any respect to local traditions when you travel? Do you remove your shoes before entering temples in East Asia? There is no logical reason for that but most travelers don't have a problem with doing that and would regard you as a bit of an arse if you refused to. You may say its different because temples have been physically built by someone but aboriginal society didn't involve building permanent structures but value natural features instead so saying only physically built structures should be respected is putting them at a disadvantage so they end up without any of their sites respected.\n\nI'm not saying ban climbing, I'm just saying that I view it pretty much the same way as I view someone who talks loudly in a church during service or keeps their shoes on when entering east asian temples, refuses to cover up when required etc.", "id": "d8q3nx0"}, {"comment": "> Totally false analogy\n\nNo it is not because it emphasizes how religious rules are ignored every single day without a second thought. Their scale does not change that fact. \n\n> They have been holding the site sacred for 1000's of years and suddenly we turn up in their world and make demands about what rules should or shouldn't apply to their sacred site.\n\nThey are holding a natural location that has existed for millions of years by arbitrary rules of their religion/culture. It is not *their* site, it is a natural rock formation they find important. \n\nNo one is going in an telling them to live my our rules, no one is saying that the aboriginal people should climb it. No they are saying you live by your rules and I will live by mine. You keep mentioning \"respect\" and rightfully so, but you seem to forget that respect is a 2 way street. Simply listening to one side is not respect it is a demand. 1 side says no climbing, the others says yes. So you reach a compromise. Establish a climbing season, establish a limited number of climbers allowed. Mutual respect either way. \n\n>  just as in Europe there have been rules about who owns what for generations which are generally respected the same is true for Australia.\n\nExcept for natural wonders this is generally not true, they are held in public ownership for the enjoyment and use of everyone. \n\n> You want to take a step back and start choosing certain features to be excluded from their traditional ownership rules just because this particular feature happens to be bigger and more impressive, more world record breaking, than the others?\n\nYes, and that is why UNESCO Heritage Sites where developed. To recognize and protect certain unique location under *international* law for the collective interest for all humanity. This isn't simply my idea it is an idea that has been around for almost 50 years in order to protect locations for everyone instead of allowing a small group to control its fate. \n\n> They aren't even asking for you not to go near it! \n\nNo they are simply asking me not to experience the site. I do not go to the Sistine Chapel to mill around the outside. I go to see the interior. I do not go to Effile Tower simply to see it from the bottom but to also get to the top. I do not go to Uluru just to see it, I go to climb it. It is part of the experience. \n\n> You agree, for example, that litter shouldn't be dropped on it. This is your western definition of how something should be respected, completely culturally conditioned by your culture. \n\nNo it is not, it has literally nothing to do with my \"western\" culture. It has to the with the physical reality of conservation. Erosion literally weakens and damages a site. Littering literally harms the environment. Those are real physical events with real physical ramifications that negatively impact the real physical environment. \n\n> Do you remove your shoes before entering temples in East Asia? There is no logical reason for that \n\nYes there is, cleanliness. Your shoes are dirty, in fact some temples/churches actually offer shoe coverings if for some reason you can't take them off. \n\nBut beyond that this is a terrible comparison. Taking your shoes off does not alter you experience of the temple, you can still see everything and do everything. It does not alter you experience at all. Banning climbing *does* alter the experience, it does change it. It literally removes a huge part of the experience for many many people. \n\nI will be very upfront I am a climber. Rock climbing as well as mountaineering. If you where to take me to Mount Rainer and told me I couldn't climb it you have just eliminated about 75% of the experience for me. Uluru is no different climbing it is literally part of the experience, just as seeing the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel is part of its experience. \n\n> You may say its different because temples have been physically built by someone but aboriginal society didn't involve building permanent structures but value natural features instead so saying only physically built structures should be respected is putting them at a disadvantage so they end up without any of their sites respected.\n\nYes I agree they are at a bit of a disadvantage, and its is completely appropriate. They wish to impose rules on a natural site. It is a naturally occurring place and they are trying to limit others experience of it on purely religious grounds.  \n\n>  I'm just saying that I view it pretty much the same way as I view someone who talks loudly in a church during service or keeps their shoes on when entering east asian temples, refuses to cover up when required etc.\n\nExcept people are not climbing it during a religious ceremony, they are climbing it when nothing is happening. People aren't wandering around talking during a church service they are doing it on a Tuesday when the Church isn't in use.  You don't visit Notre Dame or Wesminster Abbey when it is in use, you visit when it is not in use. When you can walk around talking, taking pictures, listening to your iPod or whatever. \n\nThat is the distinction here. You CAN visit a church and talk and take pictures when it isn't in use. That is mutual respect between the Church and Visitors, a compromise that lets people visit at appropriate times while still protecting its religious uses. \n\nNo matter how you slice it a natural site is NOT a temple, it is not a church, it is a natural site. One that in this case has been given a sacred connotation, that does not change it from being a natural site, and one that has been designated a wonder for humanity as a whole.

I can see why you upset him. \n\nRiding an elephant doesn't have to involve abducting the elephant from its family or treat it horribly. \n\nI went elephant riding once. There was one or two riders per elephant, no saddle, the elephants ate from the trees that we walked by, a baby elephant followed along, and when we came back we took a bath with the elephants and fed them afterwards. The elephants seemed to have a good time the whole time we were there. Sure enough we could have done all that for them without sitting on them, and we all would have had a good time still, but they didn't mind us riding them and I can't possibly see how they got hurt by it. \n\nI've owned horses myself for many years. If you think about what a horse has to go through, riding an elephant doesn't sound so bad. Horses have pieces of metal in their mouths and inexperienced riders will pull on the reins and can hurt the mouth of the horse really badly. We put shoes on the horse by hammering nails straight into it's hooves. If that doesn't sound awful, I don't know what does! Of course if you talk to a person who knows a thing or two about horses, they'll explain to you how it doesn't damage or hurt the horse as long as it's done right. You have no problem understanding that, because you're used to seeing people ride horses and you trust the people who do it and tell you it's ok. \n\nWith elephants it's obviously a different story. It's more foreign to you, and it's easier to convince you that it's wrong to ride them. \n\nThe truth is that many elephants are mistreated, just like a lot of horses are mistreated.

Forget humans riding on these animals, think about the way they're caught. Elephants are not like horses. At all. They form very intense bonds with their herd and have been known to mourn for years at the loss of a baby or another elephant.

It's comparing apples to oranges. I've helped my family raise, handle, and break foals my entire life, and of course I've seen them sold.

At some point you'd like to see some sort of real value coming out of your hard work and when you show up for lecture (again) to find there are no students because they've gone to some pizza party you were not told about you realize how little they value your time, efforts and expertise. \n\nSure, some of this is cultural but some of it isn't....they weren't cancelling the Korean professors' classes without giving them notice first so that they didn't spend time preparing.\n\nEDIT: One more thing to add is the pay. It \"feels\" like a good salary because of the setup...you're a temporary resident not really there to build a life...but if you want to live there long term there comes a point that $25-30k/yr in a first world country isn't really such a sweet deal. It's a sweet deal compared to teaching elsewhere. It's a sweet deal if you want to bust your balls and save a ton of money fast. It's a sweet deal if you've just finished school and have never made real money before....but earnings wise it's pretty limited in the long term so if you want to ever earn $50k+ in your life the opportunities in the ESL world are few.

There are very few opportunities to improve as a teacher and academic quality control is hands-off, which is why employers in other countries see experience there as a bit suspect. Teachers there also have a crazy amount of contact hours and split shifts are common; even if you want to put time into planning lessons you have no time for it. To top it off there's the \"Korean work ethic\" where six day weeks are common and you get all of a week of annual leave per year. In China I got two weeks and in Vietnam it's a whole month, fully paid. It's not the worst place in the TEFL world, but it's far from the pinnacle. \n\nFrom my experience Vietnam is a much better place to start. More focus on professional development and academic standards, people are generally friendlier and more open, students actually make an effort to communicate in English and equal opportunities to save even on a lower salary.

I heard the hikes at the Perito Moreno are a bit tame.

It's the most beautiful and mythical looking place I've been to. I'm not sure how much my return flight from BA to El Calafate was since I had booked it as part of a multi-stop ticket. I'm looking at flights a couple months ahead and I'm getting \u00a3250 return, which seems like a lot. A cheaper option could be to fly from Santiago to Punta Arenas with Sky. I remember seeing return flights for \u00a3120. Then you could do Torres del Paine, El Calafate and El Chalten.\n\nMy itinerary was fly into El Calafate, try and take out all the money I needed, which was a serious problem, because I kept reaching a withdrawal limit on every ATM in town, leaving me with just enough money to buy my bus to El Chalten and food. So make sure to bring all the money you need. I met so many people struggling with the ATMs in El Calafate, and there were even more issues in El Chalten (3 ATMs, one completely broken, one sometimes broken and the other ran out of money. I think if you withdrew a certain, random amount then it would work).\n\nSo I got a minivan from El Calafate to El Chalten the day I landed. I spent 9 days there, doing nearly all of the hikes you could do, including Viedma Glacier ice trekking. One of the best hikes which isn't as popular, but which definitely should be, is Pliegue Tumbado. The viewpoint is unreal.\n\nThen I got the bus back to El Calafate, relaxed for that day, then got the bus to the Perito Moreno glacier the next day. Left for BA the day after.

There is a 2 days hike to another lake, I forget the name, but it's on the same trail as the Pliegue Tumbado hike, you just take a left at a point in the trail. You can go ice trekking on Viedma Glacier, the largest glacier in Argentina (yes, bigger than Perito Moreno, even if it doesn't look like it when you see it).

It took until 1872 for somebody to actually say \"hey, lets protect a giant swathe of land from free development because nature is **important**\". That person? Theodore Fucking Roosevelt, one of the most badass Presidents the US will ever have. And not only was it the first, but it is still the **best** (imo). Last time I went to Yellowstone I could not count the number of distinct languages I heard. In the cabin area I stayed at, not one single group from the ten cabins was from the same country. As an American, nothing makes me more proud than the number of people who come from all over the world to spend so much time at our parks and see the often unique landscapes of the United States.\n\nAnd then some fucking shitheads feel the need to tread on the delicate ecosystems that we have collectively pledged to protect, making us have to put up additional barriers that mar our own enjoyment of our national treasures so that they won't be destroyed. There used to be two petrified redwoods in Yellowstone, each of which was over 50 million years old. Redwoods as a species haven't even existed outside of California (1,000 miles away from Yellowstone) for over 5 million years. And you know what people did? They took fucking chips off of the trees until there was only one left and we had to put a huge ugly gate around the last one to protect it.\n\nIn 100% seriousness and with no hyperbole, I believe these motherfuckers should be permanently barred from entering the United States as a result of their actions. They should have a criminal record, with all the difficulties that imposes. They should be fined generously, at the very least commensurate with the costs of repairing the damage / implementing preventative measures to bar others from repeating their actions. I wish there were some way we could make sure they could never get to enjoy or benefit from anything produced or dreamed up in the United States ever again, but that's not realistic.

While you can be extradited for any crime, even misdemeanors, the state where the crime was committed has to request extradition from the state where you are currently located. This is relatively easy, but the state requesting the extradition will bear the costs of the extradition so it's unlikely they will do so for a misdemeanor. They probably will not even do it for a felony if the specific charge is not a high priority. Basically, you are not going to be extradited for something that won't result in prison time because otherwise the result would essentially be for a state to pay to import a criminal. Imagine the public reaction if South Carolina paid thousands of dollars to transport a jaywalker from Oregon, who then pays a $50 fine for the jaywalking, and now commits some other, more serious crime in South Carolina. Most states are happy enough to let their criminals stay elsewhere.\n\nAlso, since you likely only came into contact with law enforcement because of a crime where you are located, the original state may not pay to extradite you if you are facing serious charges in the state where you are currently located, because you're probably going to jail there. The threat of extradition will be used as leverage in a plea bargain if you know you will be extradited even if you beat the charges you are facing.

Theodore Fucking Roosevelt, one of the most badass Presidents the US will ever have. And not only was it the first, but it is still the **best** (imo). Last time I went to Yellowstone I could not count the number of distinct languages I heard. In the cabin area I stayed at, not one single group from the ten cabins was from the same country.

Don't ever stop traveling. I do admit that you may slow down a bit in the beginning (you will see why once they baby is born). But it's all good.

We took our baby out as much as we can for local visits to parks, zoos museum , family, friends and family parties starting at about 3 months   (We live southern Cali  so lots to do). At 3 months my first born had her first cross country flight from Southern California to NYC - we were going back home to live)\n\nAt about 6 months we were doing the above most frequently in NYC area. She was going to art museums, restaurants. At 11 months we flew to Florida with her to visit family in Miami and Orlando.  She went to key west and Disney as well. \n\nAt 1 years old we drove to Maine  for a week with her where she had her first taste of a lobster. (Where else is the best place to start). \n\nShe turned 2 in Canada (nova scotia) 4 in Mexico (enter her little brother who turned 1 a few days before we all got to Mexico)   By 6 and my son 2 they had visited some of the Caribbean islands and most states within a 12 hour car ride of NJ and we were always in NYC with our two kids\n\nAt age 9 my daughter visited her first European countries for 3 weeks  (England and Poland.) They both have seen more of the carribean by then as well as more southern states in America. \n\nAt age 10 my daughter for the first time traveled to Peru and Panama\n\nAgain more carribean countries were visited by both kids and more of western America (Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas , New Mexico etc)\n\nAt my daughters age of 12 and my sons age of 8 (this would be HIS first time to Europe ) we went to Europe again for 4 weeks. England , Germany, France and Polabd \n\nThat same year my daughter also visited Peru again\n\nAgain a few more carribean islands were visited by all\n\nAt my daughter age of 13 and my son 9 we spent a month in Peru (her third time , my sons first ). I actually disenrolled them from school for 4 weeks (I was about to school them in our travels). We spent 2 weeks deep in the mountains of Peru close to machu pichu and the indigenous natives. And the other two weeks in the deserts as well as the capital city of Lima\n\nEarlier this year my daughter at the age of 14  and my some 10 we visited some very southern carribean islands for 10 days\n\nIn July we leave for Hawaii for 3 weeks. \n\nNext year we are planning to visit your country of ITALY (first time for all of us, and his is per my sons request, we let the kids pick the European countries to visit) , Poland and possibly Switzerland and/or Germany.  All for 4 weeks. We want to dedicate at least 2 weeks to Italy. \n\nMy son and daughter are begging me to visit Asia (China , as they have many friends from China) and Japan. Daddy has been to Korea and Middle East already. Idk if we have time for other Asian countries\n\nSo why do I write all this?  Well \n\n1. Congrats on the new baby!\n\n2. Life WILL change\n\n3. You CAN still travel\n\n4. Traveling will look different with a newborn and especially a toddler (u will understand). So expect the way your used to traveling to change\n\n5. The infant-toddler-child will slowly adapt to traveling and vice versa \n\n6. As you slowly introduce traveling to them l, you and child will slowly learn how to travel together\n\n7. As they get older , you will find them to be amazing travel partners\n\n8. So many memories and stories to share with them and with others \n\n9. As my kids get older we incorporate fun stuff but also learning about culture, food, local life, places of interest, art, history, etc\n\n10. Traveling is just as important as school \n\n11. We also made it a rule (even before we had kids and obviously when we travels writh them) we try to eat the majority of the food like the locals eat and def no American food\n\n\nI wanted to share my traveling history with you because traveling is amazing and even more rewarding with kids\n\nI love seeing and experiencing new things with my kids more and more as they get older. It is rewarding beyond imagination\n\nI wish you the best luck with ur bambino!

And the other two weeks in the deserts as well as the capital city of Lima\n\nEarlier this year my daughter at the age of 14  and my some 10 we visited some very southern carribean islands for 10 days\n\nIn July we leave for Hawaii for 3 weeks. \n\nNext year we are planning to visit your country of ITALY (first time for all of us, and his is per my sons request, we let the kids pick the European countries to visit) , Poland and possibly Switzerland and/or Germany.  All for 4 weeks. We want to dedicate at least 2 weeks to Italy. \n\nMy son and daughter are begging me to visit Asia (China , as they have many friends from China) and Japan. Daddy has been to Korea and Middle East already. Idk if we have time for other Asian countries\n\nSo why do I write all this?  Well \n\n1. Congrats on the new baby!\n\n2. Life WILL change\n\n3. You CAN still travel\n\n4. Traveling will look different with a newborn and especially a toddler (u will understand). So expect the way your used to traveling to change\n\n5. The infant-toddler-child will slowly adapt to traveling and vice versa \n\n6. As you slowly introduce traveling to them l, you and child will slowly learn how to travel together\n\n7. As they get older , you will find them to be amazing travel partners\n\n8. So many memories and stories to share with them and with others \n\n9. As my kids get older we incorporate fun stuff but also learning about culture, food, local life, places of interest, art, history, etc\n\n10. Traveling is just as important as school \n\n11. We also made it a rule (even before we had kids and obviously when we travels writh them) we try to eat the majority of the food like the locals eat and def no American food\n\n\nI wanted to share my traveling history with you because traveling is amazing and even more rewarding with kids\n\nI love seeing and experiencing new things with my kids more and more as they get older. It is rewarding beyond imagination\n\nI wish you the best luck with ur bambino!  May lil bambino be a true citizen of the world. \n\nSTO LAT! \n\n\n\n", "id": "d477rf6"}, {"comment": "Holy crap.

( some trips as long as 20 hours by car away) from when they were toddlers). In the beginning we had to have a lot more extra stops so they can stretch their little legs and hit the McDonald playground. Now they r pros.

I am the farthest from a DL fanboy (I haven't flown them in 20 years, and have constantly ripped on their repeated SkyPe$os devaluations), but this rhetoric is just ridiculous.\n\nFares aren't locked in until you actually buy them, and demand fluctuates constantly.\n\nThis post shows a profound lack of understanding of how fares are structured. That, in itself, is no crime at all, and if the rhetoric was more interrogatory (\"why did this happen?\") and less accusatory, then I'd be a lot more pleasant about the whole thing.\n\nEvery flight has different fare \"buckets\", which have a finite number of seats. You'd see this represented on a GDS like this:\n\nF7 A7 P3 J7 C6 I4 Y7 B7 H7 M7 W7 V7 G5 N5 O3 S2 Q0\n\nThis is a descending (more or less, and I'm using AA fare buckets [more or less]) fare structure from highest (F is an unrestricted first class fare) and Q is the lowest (most restrictive) coach fare. In this example, the number 7 represents *at least* 7 seats remaining in that fare bucket. Some airlines will show 4, some will show 7, and some will show 9. If it shows 7, it could be 7 or 107. Only the airline will know for sure.\n\nThey don't exist independently from one another. If one fare bucket sells out, the lowest price automatically becomes the next fare bucket. That usually comes with a price increase. So it doesn't matter how many seats are left on the plane, on my example, when Q sells out, S becomes the cheapest. You'll notice there are still plenty of the full fare (completely transferable, refundable, changeable) Y fares left, and there will be until the very end. Those will be the last fares to go, because they're the most expensive (often well over $1000 one way domestically) coach fares around (often many times more expensive than discounted (read: restricted) first or business class.\n\nAlmost assuredly what happened is either A) someone bought the last remaining seats in a particular fare bucket between the initial search and the final payment (a reprice could be triggered during any new page load, but often won't happen until the final pricing page), or B) the system hadn't yet updated the pricing to reflect current fare availability. Both are frustrating, but the farthest thing from unethical or extortion. The fact that the fare went up exactly $100 lends a lot of credibility to a fare bucket being zeroed out and being autopriced into the next fare bucket. \n\nIt's also worth noting that there are advance purchase requirements, too, even within the same fare bucket. There are Q fares that have 21-day advance purchase requirements, 14-day, 7-day, 3-day, and 0-day. Even with plenty of availability in a given fare bucket, you get inside 21 days, chances are the prices are going to shift up by $X. Some fare buckets may not have a 21-day advance purchase at all, so you might not see that particular fare bucket price change until 14 days.\n\nLastly, there is only a very rough relationship between the number of seats available for booking and the seat map. There are so, so many reasons why someone would not be able to reserve a seat they've booked (codeshare partner, group travel, only paid seats left are just some possible reasons, and I'm not saying all are applicable here). A seat map is not a great tool to use to gauge demand or seat availability. Full stop.\n\nI'm really not trying to be a dick here, but don't cry wolf until you actually understand what's happening behind the scenes.

If you wait a day, or a few hours on a popular flight, your price might go up because you end up with a ticket in a higher class of service.\n\nWhat this means is that you can get these \"The price of your flight has gone up\" messages, and your fare is higher. Delta should be notifying the customer the new fare before the customer agrees to the cost (and I'm pretty sure they do).\n\nAdditionally, E-ticket airlines will allow you to completely cancel ANY ticket for a full refund in 24 hours of booking. If you book at 8AM on Tuesday, you have until Midnight on Wednesday to cancel that ticket for a full refund. If you have to do this, call them up and have them void the ticket for a full refund. You may not get booking fees from Orbitz or Expedia back, but the flight should be refunded.

I am the farthest from a DL fanboy (I haven't flown them in 20 years, and have constantly ripped on their repeated SkyPe$os devaluations), but this rhetoric is just ridiculous.\n\nFares aren't locked in until you actually buy them, and demand fluctuates constantly.\n\nThis post shows a profound lack of understanding of how fares are structured. That, in itself, is no crime at all, and if the rhetoric was more interrogatory (\"why did this happen?\") and less accusatory, then I'd be a lot more pleasant about the whole thing.\n\nEvery flight has different fare \"buckets\", which have a finite number of seats. You'd see this represented on a GDS like this:\n\nF7 A7 P3 J7 C6 I4 Y7 B7 H7 M7 W7 V7 G5 N5 O3 S2 Q0\n\nThis is a descending (more or less, and I'm using AA fare buckets [more or less]) fare structure from highest (F is an unrestricted first class fare) and Q is the lowest (most restrictive) coach fare. In this example, the number 7 represents *at least* 7 seats remaining in that fare bucket. Some airlines will show 4, some will show 7, and some will show 9. If it shows 7, it could be 7 or 107. Only the airline will know for sure.\n\nThey don't exist independently from one another. If one fare bucket sells out, the lowest price automatically becomes the next fare bucket. That usually comes with a price increase. So it doesn't matter how many seats are left on the plane, on my example, when Q sells out, S becomes the cheapest. You'll notice there are still plenty of the full fare (completely transferable, refundable, changeable) Y fares left, and there will be until the very end. Those will be the last fares to go, because they're the most expensive (often well over $1000 one way domestically) coach fares around (often many times more expensive than discounted (read: restricted) first or business class.\n\nAlmost assuredly what happened is either A) someone bought the last remaining seats in a particular fare bucket between the initial search and the final payment (a reprice could be triggered during any new page load, but often won't happen until the final pricing page), or B) the system hadn't yet updated the pricing to reflect current fare availability. Both are frustrating, but the farthest thing from unethical or extortion. The fact that the fare went up exactly $100 lends a lot of credibility to a fare bucket being zeroed out and being autopriced into the next fare bucket. \n\nIt's also worth noting that there are advance purchase requirements, too, even within the same fare bucket. There are Q fares that have 21-day advance purchase requirements, 14-day, 7-day, 3-day, and 0-day. Even with plenty of availability in a given fare bucket, you get inside 21 days, chances are the prices are going to shift up by $X. Some fare buckets may not have a 21-day advance purchase at all, so you might not see that particular fare bucket price change until 14 days.\n\nLastly, there is only a very rough relationship between the number of seats available for booking and the seat map. There are so, so many reasons why someone would not be able to reserve a seat they've booked (codeshare partner, group travel, only paid seats left are just some possible reasons, and I'm not saying all are applicable here). A seat map is not a great tool to use to gauge demand or seat availability. Full stop.\n\nI'm really not trying to be a dick here, but don't cry wolf until you actually understand what's happening behind the scenes. For people like myself who book lots and lots of flights each year, this is a \"normal,\" albeit somewhat infrequent, and frustrating occurrence.

I worked as a travel agent for about 4 years.\n\nYou have 3 classes of service, First, Business, and Economy. For the purpose of this explanation I will just expand on Economy.\n\nYou have different classes of service WITHIN economy. The difference in prices determines the rules associated with your ticket. When you book on Expedia or Orbitz, or any of the numerous travel agencies, they are showing you the least expensive class of service available. They are denoted by a letter on your ticket.\n\nY class of service is usually fully refundable, you go through the letters (in no particular order) until you get to the least expensive, and most restrictive, ticket.\n\nOrbitz says \"We have 3 tickets left at this price\" because there are only 3 remaining seats in that class of service. If you book it right away before those seats are gone, then you pay that price. If you wait a day, or a few hours on a popular flight, your price might go up because you end up with a ticket in a higher class of service.\n\nWhat this means is that you can get these \"The price of your flight has gone up\" messages, and your fare is higher. Delta should be notifying the customer the new fare before the customer agrees to the cost (and I'm pretty sure they do).\n\nAdditionally, E-ticket airlines will allow you to completely cancel ANY ticket for a full refund in 24 hours of booking. If you book at 8AM on Tuesday, you have until Midnight on Wednesday to cancel that ticket for a full refund. If you have to do this, call them up and have them void the ticket for a full refund.

I could have drawn it out in Paint but then I wouldn't get the neat total distance, and I'd probably still have people complaining that the route didn't happen to go over their favourite spot.**\n\n**The next couple of years are probably going to see companies take advantage of all this, so we may see package deals of round-the-EU trips that make this a bit easier/cheaper, or we may be fleeced for every devalued penny we have.**\n\n**As it's looking today there are already protests for us to hold a second referendum, but once the markets stabilize I'm guessing our negotiating position within the EU will be so crap that it will be better for us to leave anyway.

I could have drawn it out in Paint but then I wouldn't get the neat total distance, and I'd probably still have people complaining that the route didn't happen to go over their favourite spot.**\n\n**The next couple of years are probably going to see companies take advantage of all this, so we may see package deals of round-the-EU trips that make this a bit easier/cheaper, or we may be fleeced for every devalued penny we have.**\n\n**As it's looking today there are already protests for us to hold a second referendum, but once the markets stabilize I'm guessing our negotiating position within the EU will be so crap that it will be better for us to leave anyway. C'est la vie.**\n\nPublic transport in UK & Ireland, then ~~hire~~ buy (duh) a LH-drive car in France, or take public transport - check prices of Eurorail, etc. Trip length probably 4-6 months.\n\n(I realise the route goes through Serbia, but I ran out of way points).\n\nEdit: okay, to give a general overview:\n\n2017\n\nApril - Ireland-Netherlands  \nMay - Germany-Latvia  \nJune - Lithuania-Czech Republic  \nJuly - Slovakia-Romania  \nAugust - Bulgaria-Italy  \nSeptember - France-Portugal  \n\nBudget: as well as ~\u00a32,000 for a car and insurance, from \u00a350pd (total \u00a39,000) to \u00a360pd (total \u00a310,800), over 6 months.

If you do end up doing this trip, I can't recommend the [Parkopedia app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parkopedia-parking/id409340361?mt=8) enough. \n\nAnd re: tolls, Italy had pretty exorbitant tolls, and at least one country required a special vehicle sticker (which was another expense) to drive on highways.

I object to the images in The Sun because I do think they are pornographic and I don't think that it's the correct medium for porn.  It is marketed as a family newspaper.  I doubt very much whether that same newspaper finds it acceptable to publish non-sexual nudity, which I think is an important part of helping kids and adults develop a comfortable awareness of the human body.

I think almost everyone I know owns one. Some of us own many. Myself and many people I know are licensed to have a concealed carry weapon. I don't know any of us who actually carry everyday. I personally got my permit to never have a firearm in an illegal manner. By that I mean I do a lot of target shooting in open spaces where it is legal.

I'm a tourist who goes on multi-month trips, not ashamed to say I'm not 'trying to find myself', just experiencing different cultures to my own (and good food, lots of it). Hostels or hotels, a week or a year, it's still a holiday in my opinion, and no one way of doing it is better than another.", "id": "d987cb4"}, {"comment": "Anyway, this is digressing. The point is, its not a bad thing to want to be better than those self-centred tourists, which there are a LOT of around the world.\n\nI disdain anyone (like the subjects of this post) who claims to be something purely for the image, but the idea behind being a 'traveller' is a good one.", "id": "d98pe8j"}, {"comment": "The entire thing here is to poke fun at the traveller vs. tourist mentality. I like learning *something* about the place I go to and do strive to be conscious of the impact on that place - but this isn't uncommon, and I'm absolutely a tourist. There are dumb, selfie snapping tourists all right, and you should *not* take behaviour lessons from them - but let's not pretend people who pretentiously claim \"I'm not a tourist, I'm a traveller\" - as if they were somehow mutually exclusive - can't be dumb and constantly snap selfies (which is pretty harmless for the most part, as much as I'm not a fan of them). I find the entire tourist-traveller thing pointless - nobody can reliably define \"traveller\" and actually explain why they're not tourists, but a tourist travels around. The dictionary definition of a tourist is \"a person who travels to a place for pleasure\" - this includes everyone not travelling for business.

I understand that a lot has been done to dissuade tourists and rescue the elephants, but are there programs to educate and transition the Cambodian workers out of the industry? I assume that giving elephant rides are the main source of their livelihood and they won't want to give it up any time soon, no?", "id": "d90bvcc"}, {"comment": "Great question! This is also a huge aspect of what the EVP works on.\n\nFortunately, elephant riding has been on a rapid decline in Cambodia recently. But for a lot of rural people, tourism had become a large source of income. This is where EVP steps in. \n\nThe first step is assessing why an owner was working his elephant and meeting his needs. We provide the owners with healthcare and their children with education to take away two major reasons why an owner would send his elephant to work.\n\nThen if the owner is interested in retiring the elephant, he is compensated. Either the elephant will be bought outright for around $20,000 or it will be put on a long-term contract. Every month, the owner will make an income from having his elephant in retirement at the EVP. All this money is fund raised through visitors and donations. \n\nSo the short end of it is that the EVP provides a lot of incentives to retire the elephant. In a lot of cases, the elephant was like a part of the family, so it's also about helping them to see what's best for it. Many families are heavily involved in the care of their elephant, even after it is retired at EVP. We want to work with people, not against people.\n\nSorry, I have a very roundabout way of answering.

It differs by culture, but in Cambodia, elephants traditionally would be seen as a part of the family! They would attend marriages, take part in ceremonies, and were genuinely loved and respected.\n\nIn India, Thailand, and Laos as well, baby elephants were paired with young boys who would become their mahout when they reached a certain age. Elephants have very similar lifespans to humans so these two would literally spend their lives together, growing up, working with each other, eating, sleeping with each other, and often dying around the same time.\n\nUnfortunately, now it is very rare to see that traditional relationship.

Not only is it extremely difficult to locate them, there are a lot of great organizations invested in protecting them. WWF and WCS work with rangers to stop poaching. \n\nIn addition, Cambodia has a very unique elephant situation. There are only around 75 left in captivity and no babies! This is caused by a few factors like the local people believing it is bad luck to breed elephants, the government making it illegal to catch wild elephants (which is how traditionally they obtained them), and the severe diminishing of the population by the Vietnam and civil wars.\n\nThis means that if someone were to show up with a baby elephant and try to sell it to the EVP, you would automatically know that he poached this baby illegally and would be facing serious repercussions. So we don't see that as a problem thankfully.\n\nIn Thailand though, this happens all the time!

It was unreal to be a part of something so all-encompassing. Sorry, I'm rambling.\n\nThat being said, if you are passionate about caring for elephants the best way to get involved is to volunteer! Not only at elephant sanctuaries but wildlife and conservation organizations in general.

The only time they were specifically guided to us was to feed them, and of course they had to eat anyway. At times, my group was told to stand back while we wait for the elephants to do their thing, or to decide to walk to us or to just walk away. The guide I had explained every behavior and interaction between the elephants; for instance, some elephants are loners, best friends, treated as the resident \"babies\" by the other rescued elephants, etc. It was very cute and sometimes sad to see the emotional/mental effects of having been abused for a lifetime before being saved and \"retiring\" at the park. In fact, the famous Lek Chailert has saved and cared for many of the elephants there. Just a look at their Facebook page can give you an impression of how much the workers and volunteers care for the elephants. After my visit, I was so glad that I didn't get a chance to ride an elephant when I lived in Thailand. The guide actually pointed out the elephant park right next to theirs separated by the river, and we saw the people at that park allowing visitors to ride the elephants' necks.\n\nThe park also fosters many other stray animals like dogs and cats.

Naturally, when an elephant first develops this pink skin, it will go from the trunk up. So the lack of pink skin on her trunk, and the concentration of it on her forehead where the hook is normally stuck, leads us to believe it is mostly scarring.\n\nAll of the elephants at the EVP have some inkling of this natural pink skin, and when compared side by side with Maelot, it's very obvious that hers was not natural.

And you **really** don't want to commute to Denver either, traffic is a nightmare. Forget about finding land for less than a half mil. Taxes aren't terrible but worse than a lot of other western states, comparable to Iowa.\n\nWyoming is mostly a high desert and plains state with some big mountains mixed in. As a whole, it's a very rural state. Your best bet for decent jobs are in Cheyenne or Casper but even then you're still talking less than 65,000 people per city. Some people that work in Cheyenne commute from Laramie which is a college town a half hour from the big mountains and 20 minutes from some smaller mountains.

Salt Lake is crammed between a whole bunch of mountains and there's an almost infinite amount of hiking you can do 15 minutes outside the city. Cost of living is less than Colorado or Wyoming and housing is still affordable at least for now. I'd definitely look at SLC as a place to go.

Cheaper cost of living, some decent sized cities to look at too.

It's not like the east and midwest where there's little thousand person towns every five miles, it just doesn't work like that here.

Montana is really two different climates with the western part of the state being more mountainous and home to more vegetation and the eastern part being prairie/arid desert like ND or SD. \n\nThe real problem I found with Montana as a young person is that the winters are long and boring and there just isn't much to do.

For the vast majority of the year the city is pretty nice.  Quiet enough that there are huge parts of the wall and streets that are completely empty and kinda spooky in places and super romantic in others.  I haven't been there for all months so I haven't seen the crazy times apparently.  August was probably the busiest I saw and it still wasn't that bad.  April, May, June, and July were fine in my book.  Maybe everyone goes during Christmas and that's when it's crazy?  Christmas would be a double whammy since you'd get foreign and domestic tourists.  All Colombians take their vacation at the same time so it's a bit crazy.  I've seen that in other parts of the country.\n\nAll I know is that I've enjoyed the city.  The first time i went I stayed in a hostel and was penny pinching.  That's great if all you want to do is party but even then I found it to be a bit too low standards for my taste.  It must have been 100-110 degrees in August and the hostels would turn off the AC at 8 am which is terrible when you've been out partying all night and want to sleep.  The rest of the times i went I stayed in hotels that cost as much as two dorm beds and were 10x greater or I rented an apartment.  Switching from the $1.50 street food and $3 cheap restaurants to $8-10 per meal really made the city shine.  It has great food.\n\nOutside the hostels are guys hustling drugs under the cover of cigarettes and candy.  You won't see that in the city walls.  It's basically a scam they run with the cops to get money off tourists.  There are about three beggars that cover the old city and won't bother you.  One's an old lady who just sits there all day.  Vendors aren't much of a problem either and if you can haggle even a little bit you'll be able to buy those woven bags way cheaper than elsewhere.  We even bought cheap dresses that held up.  If you eat outside in the squares you will probably find the most aggravation since musicians and vendors will ask you non stop while you're eating.  \n\nYour biggest concern with Cartagena should be the weather.  At it's peak the weather is the worst I have ever experienced.  A billion degrees and miserably humid.  I thought I was going to die if I even attempted to do anything between the hours of 9am and 5pm that didn't involve AC. Try to time your trip for the cooler months.

Trip planning was interesting but luckily for us my wife used to be a travel agent.\n\nWe spent 1 month in Thailand to start bouncing around to 7 different places during that time.

In Bali we split it between Seminyak, Gillie Islands and Ubud. After 2 weeks in Bali we decided we needed more time to travel and further experience life. So we booked another 2 weeks in Ubud and started discussing where we wanted to go after that.\n\nThis part was fun. We sat back and determined okay what type of vibe do we want. The answer was smallish beach town and european. \n\nPSA we are both first generation Canadians where our families including our parents were born in Italy.\n\nWith that being said we decided let's do Different beach towns in Southern Italy for a few months and learn the language since our parents never taught us this. From there we narrowed it down to Sardinia, Calabria and the Amalfi Coast.\n\nSo as it stands day 60-90ish we spent time in Sardinia specially Villasimius and travelled every few days to a different part of the amazing island. It's a special place with literally 280 crystal clear beaches surrounding the island and the island only takes 4 hours to drive from south to north. \n\nAfter that we came to Tropea Calabria and booked an Airbnb for 5 weeks. From here every couple days or so we explore Calabria, Sicily, Puglia and other parts of the south. Tropea is unbelievably with a great happening CENTER and fantastic main beach. \n\nMid August we are going to the Amalfi Coast Positano specially where a few family members will meet us for 2 weeks. \n\nAfter that we are going to tour for 3 weeks or somebody heading back home.

We decided before starting a family let's go on some awesome trips to Asia and Europe. So we quit our jobs and did it. \n\nIt's really that line in the sand of saying and doing. We find enormous value in the experiences gained while exploring the world and believe these experiences will help us grow personally so much so that when it's time to buckle down for a bit and get the professional side of our life rolling we are even better equipped to bring value to the market. \n\nI started an online business in January 3-4 months before we left for the trip as the start of my new career. Online Entrepreneur. This has not come to flourishen yet as travel has taken away the ability to make serious strides in the business. But when we get home it's grind time for 4 months or so to get that to a better place to continue to enable us both financially and from a freedom perspective to travel 2-3 months minimum per year. \n\nOverall this trip is going to cost us around $35k because we didn't skimp. \n\nAnother thing to point out is that travelling for extended periods of time come with serious ups and downs both from a stress perspective and being away from home.

You can either take a bus or a ferry to most of the other locations on the coast, but here are my personal recommendations:\n\n1) Capri. Go to the island of Capri! Very famous, and damn beautiful. Try and get a semi-private tour. It was well worth the 20 euro, and you take a private bus to the centers of Anacapri and Capri, and you don't have to worry about the super-packed city public buses. Try to go up the chairlift to the top of Anacapri, it's one of the best viewpoints of coastal scenery I've ever witnessed. Bonus points that you can see Vesuvius in the distance on the mainland. Capri is also where [the famous Faraglioni rocks](http://www.studiesabroad.com/isa_images/jpg/328901b9bbe414323fa4c1bfe366f8bf67484da6/capri03.jpg) are\n\n2) Ravello. If you're down for a nice walk, take a bus up to the town of Ravello, it's pretty high up. From there, pick a destination and walk down the steps. It is a BEAUTIFUL walk. Personally, my group (none of whom are particularly athletic or fit, so don't fret too much) walked down to Minori where we were staying. It's a scenic 1-2hr walk down the many, many steps. You might feel it in your legs the next day, but cooling down at the beach definitely helped!\n\n3) Positano. For a more touristy shopping experience, go to Positano. While it is touristy, it is absolutely beautiful, and I'd highly recommend going for at least a few hours.\n\nThe beauty of the Amalfi coast is that you're within an hour of a lot of different towns along the coast, so there isn't too much planning you need to do. Stay at one of the towns for at least a few days (we did 5 in Minori), and we basically winged it the whole time. \"Where should we go today?\" and we bought ferry tickets and went for the day, always returning to Minori at the end of the day. \n\nIf you have any specific questions, feel free to ask or PM me.\n\nPS: If you are going to the Amalfi coast, I would highly recommend NOT DRIVING or renting a car yourself, if you're unfamiliar with the roads. It is a very narrow and winding coastal road that I wouldn't dare drive myself on - leave it to the professional bus drivers, in my opinion!", "id": "d5vsh28"}], [{"comment": "This looks exactly like the beach that Anthony Bourdain goes to when the guy fakes catching the octopi for dinner.

We've already planned to go to a shooting range, check out the Zoo and some museums etc. \n\nThere's also a  fairly big football game on when we go, couldn't get tickets but wouldn't mind a few ideas for somewhere to watch it.\n\nCheers!", "id": "d5su3c1"}, {"comment": "The zoo and everything is pretty great although it can take a while to get there through public transport. I would give it a half day for sure to see everything, and that's if you rush. The zoo is quite large. \n\n* Be sure to visit Prague castle which is the largest ancient castle. Be sure to see St. Vitus Cathedral and the golden lane. \n* After that i would walking down the old castle stairs to St. Nicholas Church. It's quite a beautiful church that is only 100czk to enter. \n* The Lennon wall is next. It's an old anti-communist graffitti wall, really neat to see and only 10-15 minutes away. \n* From that you are almost directly at the most impressive part of Prague. Charles bridge. There will be a lot of tourists on it almost all day. Go in the morning or the late late evening to see it without anyone on it. \n* Next i would follow the crowd towards the astronomical clock and staromestka. There are a lot of tourist traps here, make sure you know that you are getting a good deal before spending any money, because odds are you're not.\n* Next you can travel north to V\u00e1clavsk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed (Wenceslas Square). It is the new town square in Prague and center to a lot of businesses.\n\nThose are the main spots that i would hit if you have a day or two. If you have more time here are some other suggestions:\n* Petrin Tower - an observation tower that gives an unparalleled view of Prague and especially Prague castle. Pretty cheap ~150czk. My favorite thing i saw in prague.\n* Vy\u0161ehrad - an old castle that has almost no tourists in it. I believe it is free except for a map which is around 50czk.\n* Kutna Hora - a city which has the 'bone church' i would look up pictures about it. A very good day trip since it is only an hour away by train. If you leave in the morning you should be able to be home by 5pm.\n\nSo that's all the activities, now some tips for the city itself\n* Pick pockets are supposed to be prevalent in the city. Although i think it is safer than Rome. I had my wallet in my front pocket and had no trouble during my entire time there.\n* Also Prague in terms of violent crime is pretty safe. I never felt unsafe even walking through neighborhood late at night. (i am 1.93m and 125kg, so ymmv)\n\n* BEER or pivo is the main drink in Prague. Most beers like staropramen, or pilsner, or budvar will be around 25-50czk. If it is higher than that then you are most likely getting ripped off, although it is very common in the tourist areas, so don't sweat it. You can just drink cheaper if you move bars.\n* Food will be around 150-250 for a meal in most non-tourist areas. I really like Budvarka for Czech food.\n\nAlso use public transport for everything. It is really good even if it' late at night. I used google mas to help me get home after drinking all night. There is also another app called Pubtran although it's not as user friendly.,\n\nLet me know if you need anymore help. I'm sure i rambled in here, but it should give you a good starting point.\n\nI'm also not sure about most museums as I didn't do really any. And as far as football goes I'm sure that most bars will show the game, but I wasn't there during the main football season.

The one on the right is where you line up to go in the front door: from memory it\u2019s full of metal detectors etc. If you walk towards the one on the left of your picture you\u2019ll see kind of a driveway. I got a very \u2018not allowed in here\u2019 vibe but I was able to walk through, and just beyond is a little ticketing office. The scavi tours (excavation tours) were run a few times a day. They take you into the underground necropolis beneath the basilica. The guide was really knowledgeable and it\u2019s more like an archaeological tour rather than a religious one. Absolutely no photos are allowed.

If you want some personal suggestions for Brussels, the pr\u00e9-Sal\u00e9 or Viva M'Boma in the Rue de Flandre are quite Belgian, the first just go for the Moules Frites, the second you can get your guts. ;) In Schaerbeek, quite close to Josaphat (where I recommend you stroll around a bit if you like late 19th century bourgeois architecture, it's a very beautiful neighbourhood ([walks here](http://www.schaerbeek.be/nl/taxonomy/term/52/all), just click, the walk is tri-lingual) you can check out Zinneke (69 types of Moules/frites) and Potverdoemmeke. Some people might tell you they're \"tourist Brussels food\" but  that's bullshit.\n\nAnother favourite of mine, but you'd have to go a bit out of town, is Au Vieux Spijtigen Duivel. Stoemp & Gueuze, can't go wrong. \n\nAnother option is the Marollen, which are very old school Brussels and if you look around you can definitely still get some traditional food there, plus it's a very walk-able area with quite a bit to see.\n\nThe good thing about Brussels is that it's a city that has *tons* of restaurants and that the price/quality is quite good compared to other cities.

Historically, the road network in the Republic of Ireland was less well developed and maintained. However, with the advent of the Celtic Tiger and significant European Union funding, most national roads in the Republic continue to be upgraded. In the 1990s the Republic went from having only a few short sections of motorway to constructing motorways, dual-carriageways and other improvements on most major routes as part of a National Development Plan. Road construction in Northern Ireland has proceeded at a slower pace in recent years, although a number of important bypasses and upgrades to dual carriageway have recently been completed or are about to begin.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roads_in_Ireland\n\nJust looking at one of the most obviously measurable metrics, there are 113 km of motorways in the North but 1,017 km of motorways in the Republic.

Our range of light in our eyes is far superior to that of cameras.

I you lined up a Nikon, Canon, Sony, etc cameras and had each take a photo, none would look identical to the other. They'd be close-ish, but not identical.

I can't recall if it was free or not, but even if it's not it's worth a visit.  \n* Walking around the wall was cool - you buy tickets to get up there near Pile gate, if I remember correctly.  Go in late afternoon/early evening.  It's maybe 1 mile around, but if you take your time and time it right then you'll get to view most of it in nice sunlight and then catch the sunset as you are nearing the end of it.\n* **#18** was interesting and worth a visit.  \n* **#16** has a market in the early morning.  The apartment I stayed in was right on this square so I could look out the window and watch them setup the market each morning.  They set it up and tear it down daily.  They have fresh vegetables, trinkets/souvenirs, etc.  It's worth a visit.  The square itself is cool too.  Once the market closes up the restaurants on the square will setup tables so that you can eat outdoors.  There is also an ATM in this square as well as a little convenience store should you need to buy deodorant, candy bars, water, shampoo, etc. (there are groceries in it as well).\n* eat at Lady Pi Pi - best meal I had in Croatia\n* Take the cable ride to the top of the mountain and check out the view\n* Tour the museum at the top of the mountain\n* Eat at the pizza place at the base of the cable car ride\n* Explorer Lokrum island\n* **#33** Check out Fort Lovrijenac - I actually missed out on this as I didn't think you could go inside of it, but found out later that you can get in.  It seems interesting so I'm adding it to the list.  I don't think there's much to it, but worth a look anyway.\n\n\nThings to do outside of Dubrovnik:\n\n* There is, or at least was, a taxi driver working in Dubrovnik that was born in Montenegro.  I found his email address on another site and figured it was worth looking int.  So after communicating via email a little bit before my trip I decided to give it a shot and see how it'd go.  He can take you on a day trip to Montenegro and show you around.  He's open itinerary wise so you just meet with him and talk to him about what you want to see and then he'll take you over there and show you around and tell you all about it.  Dude is basically a historian and will give you all these details about each place you visit.  Totally worth it!  We stopped in Budva, Kotor, Perast, and stopped in the hills above Sveti Stefan so that we could take pics since you can't get on the island itself.  Then we finished off the trip by having dinner [here](http://www.catovicamlini.net/).  He took us by that restaurant because it is just on a beautiful piece of land as you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSfKyShDH4g).  He said we didn't need to eat there if we didn't want to, he just wanted to show it to us because it's gorgeous.  We decided to eat there anyway at which point he said he would eat by himself, but I bought his meal and had him sit with us as a tip/thank you for the great trip.  It was by far the best meal I had on my entire trip.  It's not cheap, I think it ran around $100 a person, but completely worth it in my view.  The day trip itself was 250 Euro's, not including food.  He'd take us to each town and talk to us about it on the way, providing history info etc, then once we got there he'd just chill in his car while we went and explored.  I can dig up his email address if you'd like.  \n\n* Plitvice Lakes, Croatia... if you visit Split and walk around Diocletians Palace you'll find a bunch of random places offering bus tours to Plitvice Lakes.  I can't recall which one I went on, but I thought it was great and had a lot of fun on it.  It was a guided tour which I typically don't like, but this one was actually good.  \nNote:  You can't go in the water in Plitvice Lakes, but Krka National Park is very similar and you *can* swim in it!  It's also about an hour closer to Split than Plitvice is (2+ hours vs 1+ hour according to googlemaps).  So if you want to swim in the water than find a bus tour to Krka, if you don't care about swimming then go to Plitvice.\n\n* Hvar, Croatia... in the Old Town itself I don't think there's a lot to do, but I could be wrong on that.  It seemed like it was mostly clubs and bars so if nightlife is your thing then you'll like it.  I was more interested in museums and history.  There's a cool fort at the top of the old town - not much to it, but offers amazing views.  \n* You can rent boats and go check out the nearby islands.  \n\n**One final note** If you work in an office building and work several stories up... start taking the stairs into work every day.  You will thank me later!  If you start now then you'll be in good stair climbing shape by the time you go visit over there in late July.  There are stairs everywhere!  \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.  I can send you the links to the places I stayed as well if you want.

I'm was born in a smaller city in the Netherlands, so I also know what city life is like (though it's probably still something completely different from NY). \n\nMy family has a large, old building with a lot of land in that French town. The neighbours are an old woman and her son, who is a garbage truck driver. When he's not at work, he's busy on the lands, because forest grows quick and wood is needed to stay warm the winter. They seem happy enough, although they work hard or have worked hard in the past. \n\nWhen I'm there with my family (as a matter of fact, I've just arrived there a few hours ago), we tend to the house and land as well, because an old building needs a lot of maintenance. We also rent holiday apartments n the building and tents on the field, so they need to be cleaned and prepared as well. An example of such maintenance is an oaken floor which became moist underneath, that has come up and needs to be fixed now because the doors won't open anymore. \n\nWhen we lived here permanently, I went to school town. Or house is on a more secluded road halfway on a mountain, so I was brought there by one of my parents by car every morning. We came home for lunch and we (me and my sisters) often went playing on the fields or in the forest. All the parents of classmates were either workers in nearby factories, ran holiday complexes (don't imagine something too big, it's mainly small hotels or 'g\u00eetes'), were part of the town council and some were farmers (mainly cattle). And then there's of course the people who work for the town, like the baker, shopkeepers, restaurant owners, teachers, garbage men, church people, etc... \n\nThere you go, a little insight in life outside the city.

So, what is a \"customer,\" given a moving vehicle where weight is a consideration.... I'm glad you asked! At the time (2009) a customer was considered 250-270 lbs as the average weight. Now, most people don't weigh this as you may have noticed (except for you Mississippi, you be you!). That is because it is the average weight plus luggage (taking the average of a checked bag, carry on, shopping, everything). All budget airlines did is give you the choice of NOT taking luggage and giving you a better rate because you're actually not 250lbs anymore, or pay the original fee (which is the ticket plus baggage) for the original price.  \nIs it always worth it? No, many other airlines might give you a better overall deal if you choose to use both checked free bags and have a ton of carry on weight. But it is up to you to find out. Is that the best way? Probably not, people aren't that savvy with math, but that is what is going on.  \nNow, about leg room. Boeing is simply giving in to the market. About a decade ago, the 320 and the 737 were competing (iirc, that was a lifetime ago) and the biggest difference was that the 320s from airbus had about an inch more. Seriously, it made a huge difference, people were all talking about how much more comfortable they were, how every plane should be like this and so on. But, what happened? In cases where a 737 was competing with a 320, the reviews were worse but people still booked the cheapest possible flight regardless. It is a numbers thing. My buddy decided to make his a more comfortable ride with 2 inches more per seat. There were other factors I forget, but I do recall his final cost per passenger mile (fully loaded) was 1.21 cents. Mine was .98, over a 20% difference.  \nBottom line, if you don't like it, don't fly on those planes. Plenty of wider planes with more room and favorable baggage deals exist and you need to vote with your wallet.

Unlike many American national parks, where areas have the lightest development possible and lodging is put as far from the road as they can get, in Lauterbrunnen you are lodging right on this highway, and the town largely feels like a tourist trap, with shitty restaurant after shitty restaurant lining the road and a complete lack of naturey feel anywhere.

I have to add though, that you don't just waste your money here, the transportation always works and is (in my opinion) worth its high price and also if you buy your food in a grocery store you can be sure that your food is of the highest quality (regarding health) and costs accordingly. Having the (sometimes second) highest quality of life in the world does come with a high cost, that's why you should compare our prices to the ones in Norway, which are similar. \n\nAlso, check out airbnb.com for accomodation and sbb.ch to see your connections from point a to point b and how much it costs (you can buy your tickets online).

When you look down into it, it's incredible, and if you head up to Murren it's a great view. But turn around and it's nothing. The valley is actually quite short, and IMO can't hold a candle to Yosemite, which is all-enveloping and completely overwhelming. But the more impactful truth is that Lauterbrunnen has a highway running right through the middle of it, and it is noisy and full of trucks and cars driving way too fast, and to me that highway completely removed any sense of wonder one may have found in the area. Unlike many American national parks, where areas have the lightest development possible and lodging is put as far from the road as they can get, in Lauterbrunnen you are lodging right on this highway, and the town largely feels like a tourist trap, with shitty restaurant after shitty restaurant lining the road and a complete lack of naturey feel anywhere.

I'm a displaced Angelino (lived there 12yrs and trying to move back since I left 1 yr ago)\n\nit has \"towns\" that are suburbs of LA city, like the suburbs of Manhattan. it's a massive city that requires time to get around - so a lot of people live, shop in their towns. but it's a lot of fun.. and has some really beautiful unique areas. some of those areas: \n\nChatsworth. it's underrated as horse country and a suburb but it has a Wild West feel to it complete with a couple of saloons on Devonshire St. also great rock climbing, mountains to explore, and it's my home. \n\nMalibu - beautiful, fun place to go to the beach at Point Dume/Zuma Beach. even better if you take Topanga all the way to the ocean. Topanga is a canyon that runs east/west from the top of the San Fernando valley to the ocean and after crossing Ventura becomes a fun ride through the mountains and then downhill to the beach through a hippy sort of area.\n\nWest Hollywood has some great clubs and bars and restaurants and is very *LA* \n\nSherman Oaks has some cool morning coffee houses where hipsters are sobering up.\n\nLos Feliz (east of Hollywood) is vintage LA and a great place for some Indy stores and trendy small restaurants with overpriced salads, but the atmosphere is what you're paying for.\n\nVenice is a fun and happy freak show every day of the week. Lots of shops, food, free activities like skateboard parks, rollerblading, bicycle riding. tattoo shops, people working out, the man in the speedo, etc.\n\nBrunch is totally LA. Go into any diner and order some Eggs Ranchero or better yet, find a small Mexican restaurant for brunch and have their chorizo and eggs plate. you won't need to eat again until dinner!\n\nThe mountains are beautiful, the desert is close by (and an acquired taste but beautiful), and it's a Wild West town still. \n\nHave patience with the traffic, turn on the radio and listen to the latest gossip and newest music, have some snacks in the car, and understand there is no reason the 405 is at a standstill for 2hrs straight.. it's just how it is, you should have taken the 101. \n\n(Its my favorite place Ive ever lived in and I've lived all over Europe, the east coast, and one Midwest city besides LA and my fav playground on earth is Los Angeles)\n\nedit: werds\nedit2: my coordinates home - \nhttp://m.imgur.com/tyM108g", "id": "d5m81n8"}, {"comment": "I am sorry but no matter how much people try and put lipstick on a pig its still ugly, I have been to LA so many times, I have only ever seen the mountains when I drive out of the city on my way to Vegas.

And honestly the flights aren't so bad, you can get up and walk around if you're stiff but I took a sleeping aid and knocked myself out most of it. I will definitely book a window seat next time so I can lean though and bring a large bottle of water for between their rounds. One of my favourite places was Koh Phi Phi, such beautiful water and boat tours; cool night life and no cars. I enjoyed Bangkok but holy shit is hot there and the garbage piles up in places so stinky as well.  I mostly stuck around the south end but want to visit the North my next visit, everyone talks about how amazing the food is in Chiang Mai and Pai with lots of cool stuff to see.\n\nIf you decided you'd like to partake in animal stuff do keep in mind that they abuse the elephants, tigers and monkeys quite a bit. A good alternative is volunteering an animal sanctuary where you can feed, bath and hang out with the animals. \n\nBarter everything that includes traveling like when you book a packet with a bus/ferry/mini bus situation. They charged around 6-800 baht depending on where you'd go but you could bring them down to 200 less or more, just go to different agencies selling them and keep trying. Also the taxi's run their meters fast so it is a scam slightly but it's less so than if you take a flat rate most of the time, ask for the meter before you get in the taxi. Tuk tuk's are fun, take at least one and enjoy it; you think you're gonna die but you won't haha.\n\nThe best thing to do is try to get as many small bills as you can because Thai people don't always like giving change or if they see a lot they barter less low. Also watch your change back at restaurants, bars, hotels, 7/11, markets etc you seriously wouldn't believe how many times we got scammed or nearly by wrong change on purpose. Bangkok had the cheapest souvenirs of any place if you're looking to take some home. \n\nAlso if you go to Koh Phi Phi one of the boat tours will take you around to different beaches and take the boat that carries more people as it's a lot cheaper than private. However when you get to Maya Beach they will only tell you then that it's 400 Baht more to actually step foot on the beach or you can snorkel in the bay for free instead.

Science!\n\nFirst let's talk about rotating shit. In order for something to travel in a circle, it must have an acceleration perpendicular to its velocity. Take look at the moon around the earth as a great example.

If the car was going 15 m/s we know it needs to be pulled in with an acceleration of\n\n    a=v^(2)/r=15^(2)/30=7.5 m/s^(2)\n\nNow here is where the wall comes in. You'll notice they are sloped. This is so that the walls can provide vertical and horizontal forces. Take a look at [this image](http://www.physics247.com/physics-homework-help/images/FBD3b.jpg) showing the forces. The picture is as if the car (the dot) is coming towards you.\n\nNow I'll spare you the math, but as you drive faster,  the wall (Fn in the picture) has to push you harder to keep you in a circle. But since the wall is at an angle, it pushes you up and inward. Meaning it also opposes gravity keeping you on the wall.\n\nThe more vertical a wall is, the more horizontally it pushes you. So you have to go faster to make the wall push harder to get the vertical component of the wall to equal gravity. That's also why the wall could never be perfectly vertical.

Science!\n\nFirst let's talk about rotating shit. In order for something to travel in a circle, it must have an acceleration perpendicular to its velocity. Take look at the moon around the earth as a great example. The equation for this is\n\n    a=v^(2)/r\n\nWhere a is the acceleration, v is the velocity, and r is the radius of the circle its traveling on. Let's say this pit has a 30 m radius. If the car was going 15 m/s we know it needs to be pulled in with an acceleration of\n\n    a=v^(2)/r=15^(2)/30=7.5 m/s^(2)\n\nNow here is where the wall comes in. You'll notice they are sloped. This is so that the walls can provide vertical and horizontal forces. Take a look at [this image](http://www.physics247.com/physics-homework-help/images/FBD3b.jpg) showing the forces. The picture is as if the car (the dot) is coming towards you.\n\nNow I'll spare you the math, but as you drive faster,  the wall (Fn in the picture) has to push you harder to keep you in a circle. But since the wall is at an angle, it pushes you up and inward. Meaning it also opposes gravity keeping you on the wall.\n\nThe more vertical a wall is, the more horizontally it pushes you. So you have to go faster to make the wall push harder to get the vertical component of the wall to equal gravity. That's also why the wall could never be perfectly vertical. It would have 0% of the force vertical so it couldn't oppose gravity.", "id": "cybyu3r"}, {"comment": "So, Mr. smarty Pants, what speed were they going at the top of the well?", "id": "cyc0gbe"}, {"comment": "Let's use the image I posted above. Just remember that friction is pointing the opposite direction since its opposing the car flying out of the ring.\n\nThe sum of the forces vertically must equal 0\n\n    Fg+Fn*sin(pi-theta)+Ff*sin(theta)=0\n\nWhere Fg is gravity, Fn is the normal force, Ff is friction, and theta is the slope. We also know friction is a function of normal force\n\n    Ff=u*Fn\n\nWhere u is he coefficient of friction. We can plug this into our sum of vertical forces and solve for Fn in terms of Fg and theta.\n\n    Fn=-Fg/(sin(pi-theta)+u*sin(theta))\n\nWe also know the sum of the forces in the horizontal direction will equal our centrifugal force.\n\n    Fn*cos(pi-theta)+Ff*cos(theta)=Fc\n\nWhere Fc is our centrifugal force. We can substitute the second equal for friction and the third equation for the normal force and find Fc to equal\n\n    Fc = (-Fg*(cos(pi-theta)+u*cos(theta)) / (sin(pi-theta)+u*sin(theta))\n\nNow since our centripetal force is equal to mass times centripetal acceleration\n\n    Fc=m*a\n\nAnd gravity is mass times our gravitational constant\n\n    Fg=m*g\n\nWe can divide both sides by mass and get \n\n    a = (-g*(cos(pi-theta)+u*cos(theta)) / (sin(pi-theta)+u*sin(theta))\n\nSince we know the equation for centripetal motion is\n\n    a=v^(2)/r\n\nWe can solve for the velocity and plug in our known value for a\n\n    v=((-r*g*(cos(pi-theta)+u*cos(theta)))/(sin(pi-theta)+u*sin(theta)))^(0.5)\n\nPlug in the known values of the radius, r, the gravitational constant g=9.81, the slope of the wall theta, and the coefficient of friction u.\n\nHopefully this is understandable, I teach better with a chalkboard than a keyboard.\n\nEdit: I made a quick and dirty google-docs sheet to do the math [here](http://imgur.com/sOUS3ag).", "id": "cyc1b61"}, {"comment": "as an engineering student we are always told to sanity check our answers and 14.5 mph just seems way too slow. what were your assumptions?", "id": "cyckjsf"}, {"comment": "Theyre in the same image just without units, 30 m radius and 45\u00b0 slope (in radians in the excel).", "id": "cyckxt6"}, {"comment": "Hm.

It was hugely hyped up to me as one of the best perserved medieval cities in Europe, but when I arrived there I saw were dingy art nouveau buildings and some nice gothic structures sprinkled around. It wasn't until I went into the castle district that I appreciated the city a little bit, but even then the conflict of my mental image left me really disappointed. I had never seen a picture of a Prague so it could've been easily avoided.\n\n\nAfter I departed I continued through central and Eastern European cities until now, I'm presently in Croatia. A month of travelling has left me wanting to return to Prague to see it again, as leaving and seeing more cities caused me to appreciate it so much more.\n\n Prior to visiting Prague I had been to many other awesome places, Rothenburg ADT in Germany, Gamla Stan in Stockholm Sweden, Heidelberg Germany, to name a few.\n\nI think if you visit Prague without going to the other great medival cities, especially in France, and it isn't hyped to the moon for you, you will find it to be entertaining. It has a lot going for it, within one city.\n\nIt doesn't suck, but in my opinion it isn't stupendous.", "id": "d8n22x4"}, {"comment": "I've heard Budapest is possibly worth a trip over Prague.", "id": "d8n7xhz"}, {"comment": "I would agree with that for the most part. They're actually very similar. Both are divided by a river, a quieter administrative side and an urban neighbourhood side, and an old fortress to go up and explore that overlooks the river.\n\nBudapest's interiors on the fancy pants scale are incredible, far more moving and opulent than Prague. Even the Municipal House in Prague, one of its (I didn't go everywhere so I can't say it's the best) most appealing art nouveau buildings, is made to look somewhat plain by a single cafe in Budapest, the New York Cafe. Granted they're very different styles, I don't mean to compare them stylistically, purely on a fancy scale.\n\nThe food is also better and cheaper, it's less of a tourist mecca, and there's more to do. Prague is really short on great parks, while Budapest has two massive enjoyable parks. However Pest can be very smoggy in rush hour, and people legitimately seem agitated walking around. People were camped out in the city park to protest, their banners read 'Ligetvedok.' On top of that overall impression, the day before I left someone threw a bomb at two police officers, and on the train out they searched for any adult males traveling alone fitting the description.\n\nI was also approached aggressively and called a moron late at night for not having a lighter to give this drunk guy a light, his four friends were also yelling at me menacingly and I felt the need to run. Shortly after that a prostitute approched me and asked if I was looking for sex. Must have been just that microneighborhood as nothing of that sort happened again.\n\nPrague has more cultural events happening in it, things you juat stumble into as you're walking around, which really made me love my time there in retrospect.", "id": "d8n9znp"}, {"comment": "> Budapest's interiors on the fancy pants scale are incredible\n\nOh the fancy pants scale.

What kills me is that I didn't have a camera for either one.\n\nMy jumps were from around 10,000 ft, and both times I saw the circular patterns form just above clouds that I was going to fall through.\n\nNOTE: For safety reasons, skydiving should be a strictly visual activity, where you can clearly see the entire path you'll be taking from the plane to the ground. If something (like a large cloud) is blocking your view, there's the possibility you might run into passing birds, aircraft, etc. That would be bad.^TM In my defense, these were small clouds with nothing around them, so it was safe.\n\nBack to the story: As I approached the glory I saw a small black dot appear in the middle. This reminded me of airplane shadows I had seen inside glories before, [like this.](http://i.imgur.com/DouXduq.jpg)\n\nThe small dot got larger and I was able to make out my head, arms and legs. When I reached the cloud I met up with my own shadow, fell through the center of the glory and punched a hole in the cloud. It's a strange feeling to suddenly go from cool, dry air on your face to thick moisture. After a  second or two I  came out of the cloud and saw the ground again.

Iceland in the winter has a different feel to it. The landscapes look almost martian. There's an eerie yet beautiful atmosphere. Now i'll go into specifics. \n\n\nWe stayed in Reykjavik for only a night or two. We rented a jeep and drove to Vik and stayed in Vik for around 3 days. Vik was beautiful in the winter. Snow by the ocean is surreal. We also got lucky and saw the northern lights in Vik. From Vik we took a day trip to Vatnajokull (i think thats how its spelled) glacier and Jokursarlon Glacier. We did the glacier ice caves tour. We stayed at the icelandairhotel in Vik which had a very cozy feel to it. \n\n\nAfter Vik, we got an airbnb in the golden circle area for about 4 days. We would drive to this restaraunt called Mika every evening and the place was empty except for two other tourists. We befriended the owner and would stay after closing time to drink and share stories. You would never get this kind of intimacy in the summer with tourist season. \n\n\nThe last night or so we went out in Reykjavik. Honestly, i am a sucker for wintery landscapes and frequent r/cozyplaces almost everyday so i may be biased haha but i do not regret one bit going in the winter. In fact, it has made me want to experience other places like Norway, denmark, etc in the winter just for that feeling I got while in Iceland. Its a nostalgia you cant explain. \n\n\nHere is the link to Mika, \nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608882-d3183230-Reviews-Restaurant_Mika-Reykholt_South_Region.html\n\n\nHope this helps .

You hit on the two points I was really looking for: Low tourism and still enjoying the landscapes. \n\nI generally prefer greener landscapes but going in the winter would greatly increase my chances of seeing the Northern Lights which I also really want to do. Ugh, this just divides my choices even more. I am starting to lean towards Faroe Islands for a week on my spring break but it would be cheaper to go to Iceland for my winter break. Really hard choice tbh.. \n\nI guess the only other question I have is would I be able to drive all over the island? Are many roads closed off due to snow during the winter? \n\nIf I do go, I will find Mika and tell them you sent me. \n\n", "id": "d88rgxn"}, {"comment": "Ahh yes the roads. So we went the first week of december. Everday was sunny and although there was a lot of snow, the roads were pretty clear. The thing is, on the last night when we stayed in Reykjavik, we took a superjeep tour to Thorsmork valley. It took us 5 hours to get back as the roads were closed because of bad weather but boy did it make for one hell of an adventure that day. The downside is Iceland only has one major roadway and very small side roads so if there is bad weather, say goodbye to your chances to exploring. I guess we got lucky cause we stayed in a set location for several days before moving on. Also remember, the northern lights are elusive. We stayed for a full week and saw them once at night for 1 hour. Hope this helps in your choice. If I was you, and knowing you prefer greener landscapes, I would do Faroe.

Once in Europe getting around is much cheaper. You can get a plane to basically every European city for no more than 30 \u20ac. If you want to go cheaper, you can hitchhike and basically travel for free. From Europe you can make your way over land into the direction of Africa or Asia. Last summer I traveled from Germany to Istanbul by hitchhiking and then took the plane to India and for visa and travelling I paid 500\u20ac. \n\nHostel will come about 10 \u20ac per night in most European cities and 20 \u20ac in a few bigger ones (London, Paris, Amsterdam, to name a few) but then again, you can go cheaper by couchsurfing or if you are adventerous camping. Many hostels will also allow you to work there for acommoundation and food. Check out Worldpackers or Woofing for that. \n\nNow for food you probably can survive on 5 \u20ac, if you cook in a hostel, and 10 \u20ac if you eat out. 20 \u20ac if you go to restaurants every day. Entertainment and alcohol (clubs, museums, tours) probably will net you around another 15 \u20ac a day in average, depending on what you are up too. \n\nSo, yeah, if you are able to save up $5000 such a trip should be doable comfortably. Or if you want to go cheap you can do it on $3000. For $8000 you can travel luxerious.\n\nNow I am a software engineer so I can work while traveling, but when I was a student I participated in clinical drug trials which is the best way to make good money when you are healthy. In the USA you can earn like $7000 for a month. Alternatively you could go working as a farmhand in Australia for three months and save up $7000 easily as well. You can do the same in France though you probably won't be able to save up more than 3000 \u20ac  in the same time. If you are a native English speaker there are also many opportunities to teach English online and earn your money \"on the fly\".

I figured after partying with the same people in the same town a few times, not much new would happen and it really wasn't that interesting.

My co workers were always asking me how I afforded my trips and I'd ask them how much they spent over the weekend and that was their answer.\n\nI also traveled cheaply. I'd stay in hostels of course or even better camp where I could. One trip across Europe was done almost entirely by bicycle and guerrilla camping. On another trip we bought cheap motorcycles (about $2500) and rode up to Alaska and back. We did our research and found very reliable bikes and again camped the whole way (always hiding somewhere in the woods so we wouldn't have to pay fees.) Then we could have sold the bike for not much less than we payed for them, but I still have mine for a future South American ride.\n\nAnd finally like some people have mentioned work abroad. I taught in Vietnam for five years had a great time living there and had pretty cheap access to a good chunk of Asia. From my home base in Hanoi I explored the hell out of Vietnam during their holidays and by using my vacation days. Then, when my contract was up I'd take an even longer time off to explore other countries. My longest gap between contracts was about 6 months and I traveled to about 8 or 9 countries during that time. \n\nAnyway, I hear people say they can't find a way to travel, but the reality is they are either scared or aren't creative enough.

The Salkantay (spelling?) trek is supposed to be a lot harder and I think the difficulty is determined by how much ground you have to trek each day. The jungle trek could be difficult if you did it quickly but with a group, everybody gets to relax often and after lunch we even took a nap one day. (By the way at lunch on one of the days you stop at a small restaurant in the middle of the jungle and next to it is a farm that people volunteer with. The farm grows coffee and pineapples and has the best coffee I have tasted in 31 countries of travel and it is fresh and they roast the beans in inca clay pots and the coffee is strong and totally natural and bey unique. I recommend it but it takes 15-20 minutes.

Do any day hike, and the longer and further you go, the less and less people you'll see.
