We use the concept of significant digits to make infinite spaces behave more like finite spaces, because humans (and machines) tend to understand finite things much more clearly than infinite things.\n\nThis makes sense regarding how Rick would filter universes based on their significance. He is paring down the multiverse to just the alternate realities where things are significant to him.

They're not even the Rick and Bird Person from the dimension we care about. After all it's not like we care about the iteration of the Smith family who got left behind on Kronenberg earth in Dimension C-137. If you asked C-137 Rick if he cares about imprisoned Rick, I bet he'd say, \"What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer?\" or, \"I don't give a FUUUUUCK!\" And frankly, neither would I.\n\nSo why go through this trouble and why put this in next season? For Bird Person. Now that he died in *this* dimension, and *this* dimension's Rick knows about Tammy's betrayal, that gives Rick one last shot to escape and save the life of a Bird Person from *another* dimension. He now has to find a dimension where Tammy hasn't yet killed Bird Person and imprisoned Rick already, perhaps due to a delayed wedding. This leads him to the dimension where *our* Rick (Rick C-137) and *our* Morty presently live. Then together they blow Tammy to shit, thus saving the life of the last Bird Person remaining whom shared similar experiences with the Bird Person we saw die (such as fighting in the rebellion with Rick).\n\nWhat do you guys think?", "id": "d2ljto7"}], [{"comment": "Did not think I could make it the full 11 minutes.

He got the wrong Jerry and works out he was from C137. So he finds rick and Morty in C137, they get C137 KMichael  (to help illustrate the difference of the timelines) to bust Rick out of prison. At the end they trade Ricks and all is wrapped up. My only loose end is where do the family go in this alternate universe. I'm thinking during the breakout they could turn KMichael in assuming he's higher up in their most wanted and they might let the family, Rick included, go.

The same general history up until this point (otherwise they won't fit in) imagine how hard it would be for Rick and Morty to blend in on the dimension that the Cowboy versions of them are from?\n1. Both Rick and Morty have to have recently died and not yet been discovered by anyone of significance. If they were off world this is easier and their window is much larger.

We also know that Rick has photos and memories of a baby morty, even though he supposedly hadn't been in Beth's life since she was a kid. \n \nHere's my theory: the Rick from chroninburg dimension is dead or perminantly gone, possibly due to the fight against the galactic government. Rick C-137 never left Beth and was in her life the whole time, but something happened to C-137 and Rick was forced to leave his daughter behind to a new dimension where his daughter thinks he left her. He simultaneously lost his daughter and has to deal with the same daughter who thinks he abandoned her. Is it any wonder he drinks and says \"I am in great pain, please help me\" in another language? He can't even show his emotions, because he wouldn't want to be hurt or get rejected by his daughter if she found out. This is also why Rick remembers baby morty, and why he has more emotional attachment than the average Rick to Morty. \n\nThis could also explain why Rick haaaaaates Jerry. Rick probibly influenced Beth into marrying someone better in C-137, but now she's married to Jerry in this universe. Morty (and possibly Summer) are inevitable, so he watches Beth suffer through this marriage. Sounds like it's time for another shot from the flask to me.

For whatever reason, he is no longer there. You can gather from Beth's stories that he just vanished, leaving her with her \"horrible\" but mostly brushed off mother. My guess is that Rick told his wife to tell Beth he just left. In C-137, he never needed her to give and excuse but in D-2 he never made it back. Once whatever happened in C-137 happened, Rick C-137 had to look for a new universe and went into D-2. We can infer that whatever happened in C-137 was incredibly bad. Possibly a nuclear war or something where Rick C-137 could not save Beth, Morty, or anyone else. This would be why Rick really cares about D-2 Morty enough that in \u2018Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind\u2019 he shows emotion that is apparently unusual for a Rick toward Morty. Morty is a reminder of his home dimension, his \u2018real life\u2019.\n\n\n\nSo, now he is in the D-2 dimension. This Beth has abandonment issues, and has gone through life without him. All her choices weren\u2019t influenced by her father Rick, so she married Jerry and became a horse surgeon. She has a lot of issues because Rick wasn\u2019t there, a lot of issues that Rick can now only regret. He lived the happier path, and now he has to live the path he doesn\u2019t deserve.\n\n\n\nRick is really an amazing father and grandfather, but he has been labeled a deadbeat and selfish for what his alternate self has done. Even then, D-2 rick probably died a noble death so that isn\u2019t even fair. It\u2019s all really depressing and explains a lot of Rick\u2019s behavior. Think of how Morty felt when they went from D-2 to D-3. D-2 and D-3 are almost completely identical, as if none of the events even happened and Morty has an emotional crisis. Now imagine Rick from C-137 going to D-2 where a lot had changed. It makes sense that he would be an emotional wreck.\n\n", "id": "dadg976"}, {"comment": "It's all very complicated.

Morty then gets reassigned to that one fucked up Rick that likes Jerry. Cue a couple episodes with wacky Rick and Morty going on crazy adventures with the Rick taking him to fantastical and incredible places that the OG Rick wouldn't take him because it didn't further his own goals. OG Rick then comes back to get Morty via incredibly violent ways (like the wars he and Bird-person went through because Bird-person isn't there anymore to hold him back) and wants to run away with Morty so he can bring down the Galactic Federation once and for all.  Morty realizes that the OG Rick is pretty much a horrible person and chooses wacky rick over him. Wacky Rick decides to get the council involved to take down the know very dangerous criminal. With Morty's help he convinces the council to create an army to track down OG Rick. But by the time the council and the galactic federations armies catch up to him he's already taken over multiple worlds and has a massive army as well. Cue a huge fight scene with confusion on all sides, even friendly fire. Eventually it becomes clear that OG Rick is losing this battle. Cue scene like [this](https://youtu.be/cWfK5JyD2bA?t=44) and OG Rick breaks down when he's clearly been outmatched. The collective federation and council decide that they can't take any more chances and need to execute OG Rick right there. They ask if he has any last words and he uses them to apologize to Morty for being so selfish and short sighted. Morty forgives him. OG Rick is killed. Next episode the family is trying to cope with living with a new Rick when something absolutely horrible happens to the council and the federation. A giant flying Cthulu monster kills and takes out most of the council. Wacky Rick decides they need more help and breaks into a secret chamber on the Council Planet known only by council members. The room contains the means to just straight up bring anyone back to life. Wacky Rick and Morty then bring OG Rick back. They then enact this crazy scheme involving Cthulu babies. End of the day OG Rick is victorious and saves the council. He says that there a bunch of pussies and he saved the day single-handedly so they need him to stick around.

It would be odd if Rick and Morty were friends with MPB, but he was just never around for the other episodes given that these clips exist. It would not be impossible, but it would be odd, to a point that I think the writers would avoid that, which increases the likelihood that they are a different pair of Rick and Morty.\n\nYou suggest that we do not take the intro seriously in any way. I think that best practice would be to see it as indicative (but not definitive), a balance between throwing the baby out with the bathwater and relying on this single piece of evidence as being definitive.\n\n", "id": "daauyix"}, {"comment": "but again, my point is that there's just as much chance this is just a joke they slipped in because it is the parasite episode.\n\nthe problem is that this opening scene would pidgeon hole them with a lot of problems if they decide to bring back that rick and morty.", "id": "daav1h9"}, {"comment": "This is the best part of R&M, three paragraphs talking about evidence and using percentages all around a character named Mr. Poopybutthole.\n\n\nMr. Poopy.

OG Rick then comes back to get Morty via incredibly violent ways (like the wars he and Bird-person went through because Bird-person isn't there anymore to hold him back) and wants to run away with Morty so he can bring down the Galactic Federation once and for all.  Morty realizes that the OG Rick is pretty much a horrible person and chooses wacky rick over him. Wacky Rick decides to get the council involved to take down the know very dangerous criminal. With Morty's help he convinces the council to create an army to track down OG Rick. But by the time the council and the galactic federations armies catch up to him he's already taken over multiple worlds and has a massive army as well. Cue a huge fight scene with confusion on all sides, even friendly fire. Eventually it becomes clear that OG Rick is losing this battle. Cue scene like [this](https://youtu.be/cWfK5JyD2bA?t=44) and OG Rick breaks down when he's clearly been outmatched. The collective federation and council decide that they can't take any more chances and need to execute OG Rick right there. They ask if he has any last words and he uses them to apologize to Morty for being so selfish and short sighted. Morty forgives him. OG Rick is killed.

A giant flying Cthulu monster kills and takes out most of the council. Wacky Rick decides they need more help and breaks into a secret chamber on the Council Planet known only by council members. The room contains the means to just straight up bring anyone back to life. Wacky Rick and Morty then bring OG Rick back. They then enact this crazy scheme involving Cthulu babies. End of the day OG Rick is victorious and saves the council. He says that there a bunch of pussies and he saved the day single-handedly so they need him to stick around. The council doesn't really go for it though and they think he's still a horrible person deep down. He then reveals what he saw when he was dead. There was an after-life. And he went straight to hell where Satan finally got his revenge on OG Rick. He definitely doesn't want to go back there so he agrees to be tracked by the council and is forced into being a member.

What he probably figured out on a whim is known as the **[euphemism treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism#Evolution)**.  \n\nAllow me to elaborate:\n\n* When \"imbecile\" was deemed offensive, the medical term \"retarded\" was introduced, specifically defined for objective observation with no underlying sentiments, just as Rick stated earlier.\n\n* Since he said \u00bb_That_'s retarded\u00ab, he was using the medical definition on a thing rather than a person, so clearly using it figuratively.  \n \n* This figurative use started already when the word was introduced:  \nEven as a medical term, it still describes a negative trait. So some people would use it when others did ill-advised things, to accuse them of their mental laziness for not making use of their full intellect, acting \"as if they were mentally challenged\" _even though_ they aren't. (And thus actively opt for not doing something out of complacency as it wouldn't be a challenge _for them_. That interpretation of reasoning admittedly is using some goodwill, however.) \n\n* This figurative use got so common that this word that was once meant to be an objective description became more-well known in public for its figurative use as an insult, resulting in the term getting a negative connotation.  \n\n* So even though this figurative use originally didn't make sense as the accusation it originally described when directed at those who are actually mentally challenged (since you can hardly accuse the mentally challenged of being lazy for acting mentally challenged), the cultural shift added derogatory undertones that suggest contemptuousness towards mentally challenged people.\n\n* As a result, the public opinion has shifted, deprecating the use of \"retarded\" and deeming \"mentally challenged\" as politically correct. \n\n* The problem here is that the same process has happened before with \"imbecile\" getting replaced for \"retarded\": [Imbecile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imbecile) happened to be a medical term as well. This is aslo known as the _euphemism treadmill_.\n\n* In conclusion, replacing the word is just temporarily fighting the symptoms. (And though it is still fighting for something, it's basically using [newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak) as a weapon.)\n\n* But the actual root of the problem is the attitude towards \"\"imbecile\"\"/ \"retarded\" / metally challenged/ 'differently abled' / ['atlantoaxially instable'](http://imgur.com/gallery/QI79z) people, and in which context they are referred to.\n\n* **TL;DR**: If you want to make a real change in society, you have to change the mindset, not the vocabulary.\n\nRick probably thought the whole process through, and whether Morty realized it or not, provocatively let him know that he does care to participate in a new temporary cycle of the euphemism treadmill.\n\nWhich at least seems likely to me, considering that he isn't even concerned about things with _far_ greater impact:  \nWhy on hell would someone care about adapting to the latest, _interim shift_ of _a single word_ for the sake of political correctness that is so profoundly desensitized and detached from life to the point where he doesn't even care about [creating and destroying _whole universes_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4832268/)?", "id": "d89ec57"}, {"comment": "I think he was actually using it in the literal context of the word, and is specifically stating that he **IS NOT** referring to what you are referring to.\n\n\nIn Latin, retard means to slow down or decrease progress.

Like, just wash your clip instead and stop scarring children.\n\n> Idea Rick and Morty where they go to a planet that practices circumcision before matingas part of courtship. Morty almost gets some buy is rejected when it turns out he isn't circumcised. Starts asking if Rick will do it for him.\n\nide Story about Jerry being supportive because he was circumcised but Beth wouldn't let him do it because there's no medical reason. Accuses Jerry of just wanting Morty to do it because Jerry had it done and doesn't want to admit anything is wrong with his. Rick butts in to agree with Jerry, Jerry accuses Beth of just wanting what HER dad wants and that she's a hypocrite. They fight on the background the rest of the show digging up more and more obscure facts with Beth diving into deep nedical, theological, and eventually Cthulhu stylr hidden records. Jerry spends most of his time at a library then accidentally joins a cult where everyone is nice and pleasant and they just five him the info Beth fought for, and then have tie and mass suicide because fuck referencing them again.\n\n> Anyways, they already did Pluto is a Planet so we aren't arguing social mores here. No, what happens is Morty goes and gets a prosthetdick to use instead since his parents won't let him get circumcised, and Rick would have originally signed after giving a speech \"are you sure about this,  M-Morty? I mean, it's your junk to decide with. But there's a, there's a lot of nerve ending's and such down there. A lot of sensation in that litter flap, Morty, and there's a, there's a whooooole huge universe out there to get into, to really feel and connect with it, Morty. You sure you wanna just throw that away, Morty? For some alien girl who was fine with all the freaky alien sex from her point of view, but she's drawing the line at a little foreskin? I mean I'm not one to discriminate, just saying that's kind of a weird place to draw the line. What's next, she eats your testicle afterwards and holds them in a sack to make more little Mortys whenever she wants? You gotta . . . Urrrp . . .you gotta start doing your research, Morty. We got lucky with that Gazorpazorp thing.i mean I'll do it if I have to, Morty, but I don't enjoy shooting your little alien dangers to the existence of all life as we know it. Still got the gun, just don't make me use it because you couldn't be bothered to attend this planets equivalent of a 5 minute sex ed video.\" Then he finds out he would have to wait in line at the hospital AND the Alien DMV and then again for their alien 5 minute sex ed video and says \"fuck it fake duck works.\".\n\nAnyways it turns out the foreskin is used to give sentience to the baby and sheds/regrows every month like menstruation in women (insert short clip of gender swapped reference to shitty IRL comedian joking about her period. Like don't even change anything, just use Allie Cho or someone who thinks all men are terrified of it like all men are stuck in the 80's.)\n\nSo Morty bangs the alien chick with his fake dock that has no foreskin, and when she asks ti have it \"for the baby\" he reveals what he and Rick have done with the prosthetdick they chase him down to get it but neither he nor Rick knows why because they skipped the sex ed and assume it's some sort of religious thing and act all self righteous about it. Maybe toss in a brief note about how sex without circumcision and even maturabation are illegal (since it results in either mindless retard babies or wastes a foreskin which is considered to have its own dormant intelligence. Or maybe a shared consciousness with the attached adult and maturabation prevents it from remedying with the dad and instead separating and dying off since it is supposed to attach to the baby.) Anyways all that just so you can make a bunch of jokes about how much they loooove foreskin.\n\nAnyways as they fly off the FIL of Mortys alien baby mama is comforted by her father who takes her to set up at a care centre for children born without foreskin and foreskin saved from chronic masturbators and she will hopefully find a compatible one before too soon.\n\nOh, even better if the baby is actually just a clone made from the females body and that sharing the foreskin creates a new consciousness that develops its gender based on its self perception and the aliens are all clones with perfect bodies. And they get pregnant through emotional intimacy, so the entire time Morty is being a nice guy Rick is just having tons of soulless sex with beautiful clone people despite having his foreskin attached as well. Or maybe it got \"shot off\" at some point and that's why he know how to make a prosthetic.

The robbers used that fact that the building would be low staffed due to the holidays as one of their tactics to take it over. \n\n3. Lots of classic Christmas music is used in the sound track, what would replace that? The Christmas theme was used all throughout the movie to give you the Christmas feel.\n\n4.  Finally, in one of the last scenes when John tapes the gun to his back to save Holly is the holiday packing tape that was being used to wrap presents. Sure it could've just been normal packing tape to tape boxes but with the running theme of Christmas it pulls everything together.\n\nAnd if you're using the logic that \"change the xmas theme and the movie is unchanged\" then you can fucking do that to almost any christmas movie ever.

Its all taken seriously when it should be. And that's why i like it so much.

Which itself was probably supposed to kill him.\n\nThe show explores so many things at a level that others, like Southpark, just gloss over or mock. I can't watch Southpark at all because it turns everything, even the most serious of issue that probably should not be joked about, and just makes it into a gag. I mean, for example the treatment of \"retarded\". RnM uses humor, but ultimately treats the issue of mental disability with some respect. Sure, there are jokes about how Morty is really dumb, or the scene with the haunted microscope, but ultimately at no point does the show imply that Morty is lesser for it, or that \"lol retards\". Southpark I feel just makes fun of the issue and makes it seem like mental disability is something that is a joke, and that those that think its offensive to joke about it are themselves a joke. Which really is a recurring theme within Southpark, how something being offensive is somehow inherently funny. Sure, some situations that are serious can be made funny (like the whole purge thing, or how Jerry's unemployment is used as a setup for a joke many a time), but the issue itself shouldn't be made a joke. Rape isn't funny. Neither are disabilities, or depression, or violence, or racism, etc, etc. You can use it for setup, as part of the environment and to lead into another joke, but it itself should not be the joke. RnM may make a joke at Jerry's expense regarding his life, but it doesn't make his life itself the joke. Its funny how Rick went and started shouting outside Beta's spaceship after the credits, but the breakup scene and attempted suicide were not. \n\nI hope that rant made sense at all. It's annoying seeing a lot of serious issues made fun of, so it is really refreshing when a comedic cartoon can make jokes regarding an issue, while still treating it with the severity and seriousness it deserves or requires. Even more so when the cartoon can still be fairly crude and whatnot.", "id": "daq0j9u"}, {"comment": "For fucking sure", "id": "daprbwo"}, {"comment": "As ludicrous as the marriage counseling episode is, it runs so deep and hit me hard being somewhat fresh out of a 4-yr relationship.", "id": "dapv2l1"}], [{"comment": "See you space scientist...", "id": "dap7s6n"}, {"comment": "That was my first thought too.

When you ask like that I have to help! ok, ummm it's a big topic. I was actually going to do a bunch more research because there are a lot of people that seem to actually want to know now that this happened. For now I'll say that it has to do with the fact that the UK is a trade nation. People seem to think that because it had a trade deficit that it isn't an exporter, but it exports a lot and would likely export more if they weren't in the EU (there are many reasons). I've been watching the debate for this evolve since 2008. Watched Ukip grow and watched the EU keep steamrolling ahead. Do you know that there was a slew of planned referendums to ratify the Lisbon treaty/EU constitution and after member countries started to vote No, they just stopped the whole process and went ahead anyway?\n \nLet's leave the political issues with the EU government aside til later. \n \nConsider, for now, the truth about the financial implication... or at least just the truth of the market reactions, just to show you what wasn't being said/isn't being said. \n \nIf you go to finance.google and look up the FTSE 250, you will see, initially this ugly ugly drop. Holy crap right? the sky is falling. Now click the 1 month window link on the graph. They're literally where they were Jun 16th. Is that indicative of just short term wooziness before the vote as well? click Year To Date. Then click freaking 10 year. Now do the same for the GBP (the pound) for 5year, and the Euro for 5year. (The brightest is the FTSE 100 actually; I chose the FTSE 250 to get the worse picture with 250 ticks versus the top 100; it's still better than the other EU stocks). Does that put it in perspective? They're way up. The other day was just a blip. Artificial I would suspect with all the big wigs that wanted the UK to remain. The 5year is the truth.\n \nThe Euro has been on steady decline and has lost twice the value as the pound. There were a lot of rich people that wanted the UK in the EU and they invested, divested right on the vote. They got the headlines they wanted, but the history tells the truth. \n \nNow look at the Italian market (FTSE MIB (Milano Italia Borsa)) down 12 freaking % vs FTSE 250s 7%. NOW look at the YTD range. They're down from 21.4K a year ago to 15.7K. That's like 25%. 10 year? They've been dropping since April 2015 after a climb from 2012. I haven't found terribly much yet but Italian textiles have been blocking British trade interests through the EU. \n \nLet's check Spain; the IBEX 35. Same deal. 12% drop and has been up and down since the 2008 crash with a return to the crash low in 2012, just like Italy. The UK had no such drop and has been steadily rising since 2008. They've also been blocking the UK/making protectionist laws, and I'm researching that and Italy this weekend.\n \nLet's check France (CAC 40). Low in 2012, 8% down over last trading days. Not as bad but also more volatile if you look at the 10year. France is also showing rumblings of wanting to leave the EU. They're constantly striking and rioting though, blocking/protesting Uber, etc, so they want more social welfare. The UK wants to protect their NHS but they definitely want more free trade and wanted out so that they could make their own laws instead of being trumped by the European Commission (a whole nother topic; very anti-democratic. The EU system of government is very technocratic, hence the anti-elitism (which the college educated pro-EU crowd like to trumpet as anti-intellectualism, but it's not)).\n \nFinally, Germay. There appear to be several, and the German exchanges (apparently there are like 7 or so) is about what the UK exchanges are. Germany is the other economic powerhouse of the EU and is why they are so influential in EU dealings. A lot of people talk about the UK getting special treatment, and that it's arbitrary because the UK cries about stuff to get it's way. That is not the case. The UK and the German economies are what allow the EU to be what it is. When the EU interests were stifling the UK as a productive  foundation to the EU, so much so that it started to prevent the UK from succeeding, then add in the mix the mass immigration and an ideological logic-block \"I don't want to appear racist\" mentality, preventing sensible controls and skepticism, areas in host countries that are \"un-policable\" because of anti-integration communities chasing out cops and media... the balance tipped; this was right around when Merkel made her feel-good short-sighted announcement of \"everyone come in\" flag-waving at the train stations, then had to reverse her stance not a week or so later After she had started the giant wheel turning of migrants mid-migration in Greece and Turkey. \n \nNow Turkey has not met their requirements for joining, but has been pushing hard to join. The difference now with the migrant crisis is that they are twisting the EU's arm because they're holding all the migrants, basically saying pay us or we won't do your dirty work keeping them here. Same with Greece. The UK is saying it shouldn't be an issue in the first place. They have neighbors in the middle east that should be taking the brunt of this and getting their crap together, but nobody is doing what they need to do to resolve this, and we're not going to have the EU tie one hand behind our backs, then bring in these migrants under unrealistic quotas without the laws we'd need to make it happen. \n \nIn regards to the percentages needed to overwhelm a system/economy, have you seen the graphs on how social services are strained because of the babyboomer/age demographic shifting from younger worker ranges to pensioner ranges? Immigration should help that strain IF a country has controls to ensure the people coming in are qualified/have jobs/skills/and the influx is controlled, the immigrants integrate and disperse, etc. But in the EU system, it's just a larger than controllable influx with no ryme or reason because they're all refugees and economic migrants taking advantage of the refugee status. They form insulated, unintegrated communities that just get EU benefits. \n \nThe brexiters want to institute sensible controls like any other sovereign country; the EU beaurocrats on the other hand have ideological agendas, and any discussion about the immigration issues has been painted as the brexiters being racist and anti-immigration. If anything they want more of the right kind of immigration: people that want to work in the areas where the UK needs work and growth. The Australian point system would accomplish that. Remainers keep trumpeting about how that would possibly result in More immigration, but that proves that they're so blind-spotted with misunderstanding. \n \nThere are a lot of cries that brexiters are uneducated and ill informed, but in fact it's the illusion of being informed the other side that makes them think that. The older voters that voted to leave were the same that saw the UK before, voted to form/join the EU in 1973/75 and that have watched the legal fights in the EU parliament and seen how it's actually anti-democratic with the Council, Commission, etc. They now vote to leave and the college towns/major cities with this illusion of EU utopian vision of \"forward thinking\" have no idea how the EU works, what it's been doing, and where it's going. They just think it's the future of unity and that's the big plan so going against it must make you a backwards moron.", "id": "d4nz60j"}, {"comment": "> The UK is literally Rick in this situation\n\n\nDrunk, unpredictable, and insane?

After securing those with a little of two component epoxi glue I covered the ground with styrofoam and carved out the shapes I was able to with a box opener (clogged the vaccum cleaner with the styrofoam thingies after tho lol) and covered the whole thing with a layer of the light purple clay and added the eyeball plants and spiky thingies. Used the wire that was now poking out as supporting leg structure + backbone. \nI \"threaded\" the shoes and the pants (which sounds way easier than it actually is haha) and then built up from the bottom, letting the clay dry between sessions, so it wouldn't collapse under the next section's weight.\nEach part of the characters were sculpted independently and then \"threaded\" onto the wire structure.\nThe clay I used it's called Cold Porcelain and it's mainly made from white school glue and cornstarch.

Constantly using up all your potions and revives until you run out, in which case refer to driving around for another hour. They don't level your Pokemon up.

Seems illogical to me. In my opinion, Rick has figured out *why* to care, which allows him to do so \"because he wants to, when he wants to\". His apparent selfishness in some cases also reflects this (alleged) personal philosophy. Part of human nature (and, in my opinion, the meaning of life) is to survive, and I think that is why Rick \"cares\" sometimes and not others. Because, if you notice, he performs most selfless acts when his own survival (or, in the case of the last episode, his future survival) is on the line. Rick's justification for why he protects Morty from harm is a major example of this: Morty's survival is key to Rick's own survival, as without Morty he would be found and killed by his many enemies.\n\nI also believe that Rick knows the outcome of the dimension he's from. If he can travel to any dimension, can he not analyze what is going on simultaneously in *every* dimension? If that's true, then Rick can know what's going to happen in this reality by ruling out what happens in every other reality. Perhaps that's how he knew what to do so quickly after they fucked up their own reality and had to hijack one that they were killed in. Given the infinite number of universes/realities theory that this show seems to embrace, with every reality representing a possible outcome of a situation, theoretically (as long as he has a portal gun) Rick can exit any situation by simply hijacking another reality that he dies in.\n\nSo maybe that's why he \"cares\" sometimes and not others. He knows that he's going to get out of that prison, and that Morty isn't going to be killed. As far as anything else, why would he care? He can just fire his portal gun and move to another, more comfortable, reality.", "id": "d58in4q"}, {"comment": "Logic is a human construct anyway, so it's a bit of a turtles-all-the-way-down topic. I think Rick struggles with whether there's any point to surviving. Instinct kicks in, and it happens, but he's also very much aware that that's what is happening. At least that's what I project onto him, because that's how I feel. How would any of us really know what a cartoon character thinks?

Instead everyone succumbs to peer pressure, needing approval, paranoia over their thoughts, struggling with depression from feeling isolated, and continuously repeating the paradox cycle of wanting friends while also wanting to be left alone. I'm not talking about giving up all our personal information, joining together in a caravan, and drinking arsenic laced kool-aid. I'm saying, how can we make our shared online experience easier for each other to connect? Beyond dating, hookups, and selling things. We already have forums, but could we improve outside of forums to the greater internet where everyone deserves to be treated with decency and find others who can lift their spirits? When can we start our own age of internet enlightenment where we become a global community instead of a national or cultural one?
