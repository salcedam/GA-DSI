Especially on a subject like tattoos. You have the nerve to say that your pallet is more refined while talking down to others, comparing art you like to something by Michelangelo while comparing art others like to spray painted graffiti.\n\nAnd this is on the subject of women that you personally consider to be attractive ruining their bodies by getting tattoos. You can't seem to wrap you head around that fact that:\n\n* These women are individuals with freedom over their bodily autonomy and can choose to do what makes them happy without making your personal preferences a priority.\n\n* It's creepy to say that it should be \"criminal\" for a woman to get anything more than an ankle tattoo because they look a certain way, you are placing certain limitations on what is acceptable for women to do based on your personal perception of their physical attractiveness. Um, you shouldn't do that.\n\n* It is possible for other people to disagree with you and to find something that you apparently see as a mistake to actually be attractive. Their taste is not less refined or unique than yours, it is just different. You are not some important person who knows or understands better than others, your opinion is not more valid.\n\n* This thread and this post had nothing to do with tattoos until you made your comment. Some people like them, some people don't, but I'm sure for most people tattoos by themselves wouldn't be a dealbreaker. You *start* a discussion on tattoos--presumably because you see a girl that is really attractive and don't want her \"god given gift of skin\" to be \"ruined\"--and then act absolutely incredulous that some people would have a personal preference that is different to yours. This isn't rational or healthy, it's you having your head too far up your ass.\n\nIf you really are old enough to be that redditor's father then that's pretty sad, because it's clear from your behavior that you still need to grow up.", "id": "d9klb94"}, {"comment": "Doubt it.

Or working as servers or bartenders or at Lululemon or in clothing stores?\n\nWas every single guy that fucked a hot chick (or decently attractive chick) in college a millionaire businessman?\n\nAll you have to do is:\n\n- have some self-confidence; \n- be somewhat funny (and it actually doesn't take much to make a girl laugh, it's more in being confident with your delivery); \n- be somewhat interesting in that you read or play an instrument or are intelligent or write or just do **some type of hobby other than playing video games, or redditing or jerking off all day** (not that you can't play games at all);\n- know the basics of how to not dress like a clueless child; \n- maybe go to the gym once in a while (though girls care less about appearance than men, and if you are fat, but interesting and funny you can still get a date with a cute girl); \n- and learn to not be afraid to go up to attractive girls knowing that you might get rejected, and continue to approach other girls in a non-creepy way and talk to them and ask them out, until you realize that you aren't going to die from rejection. And that even if 9 girls turn you down when you ask for a number, there still might be a 10th girl that would say yes.\n\nYeah, this sounds like hard work and that it would be scary to step out of your comfort zone to do these things and face rejection like this. But that's because it **is hard work.** Of course it is.\n\nBut only things that are hard to do or scary are truly valuable and fulfilling when you accomplish them.\n\nAnd for a lot of guys, that would include getting a number or a date or getting pussy from a hot blonde girl with big tits. That would be a major accomplishment to achieve.\n\nAnd so it is worth the work. It's way better than constantly sitting at home, jerking off to pictures of girls on Instagram that are out there actually livin'. \n\nThese are *real* people, remember? Even if they are hot and have big boobs and lots of followers on Instagram, they are still just other people. \n\nAnd seriously, are there not lots of other hot blonde (or brunette, or asian, or redhead, or black) chicks on your campus? I know there are on mine. \n\nAre they some sort of magical, unapproachable creature? Do they only go home with 47 year old millionaire sugar daddies when they go to the campus bar? Of course not.\n\nBut the more you sit at home and stare at a simulacrum of their image while jerking off, the more you'll start to think of hot chicks (or even averagely attractive chicks) as some sort of mystical unicorn-type creatures that only exist in pornified fantasy world.\n\nI love porn, and I love jerking off. But sex with a real girl - with a real hot chick, is a billion times better. So is sex with an average looking girl. Hell, even with an ugly girl. It is a real life experience that feels fucking great.\n\nBut of course, Redditors want to think that the only people who get laid - or even who get to fuck 8 out of 10s or 9 out of 10s - are all either:\n\na) guys who are ripped, or have model- or movie star type good looks, or\n\nb) are rich\n\nThat way they **don't** have to acknowledge the reality that if you actually are merely *an interesting, somewhat funny person with a bit of confidence, maybe some musical or artistic talent, are not a complete idiot, and know how to bathe and dress, you could quite easily go get an attractive girl's number at a bar.* And that becoming that type of person actually might require some personal change and hard work.\n\n**EDIT:** And when I say \"Redditors\" think this way, I don't mean every single person who uses Reddit. I use it to describe a certain segment of the Reddit population who use this website so much that they actually self-identify as \"Redditors.\" In the same way that someone might identify as a Republican, or a Feminist.\n\nAnd I used that term because I presume that it is these types of \"power-users\" who tend to think this way about women (i.e. that you have to be rich or super hot to get them). Which is I think a pretty fair presumption given the popularity of tropes like:\n\n    a) be attractive    \n    b) don't be unattractive\n\non here.

My wife and I spent years trying to get her into a relationship - being a \"wing couple\" if you will. Her problem is every time we go out, all she's interested in is guys who are a 9 or a 10. Sure they'll chat her up, on a rare occasion they're drunk enough to give her a number, and on a slighter occasion she gets a first date. But when she hooks up with that rare hot guy, she almost never gets a 2nd or 3rd date because she looks like a tall troll doll. So now she's 45 and has a lot of cats, but no relationship for years. She keeps trying, but still doesn't even realize that a hot guy is out of her league. Now she's 45 and not just hitting on guys who are a 9 or a 10, but guys TEN YEARS YOUNGER who are a 9 or a 10.\n\n>Good thing she likes cats.\n\n>Now my best buddy for years was the same. He was at best a 5, maybe a 6, and he'd always go after the smoking hot 9 or 10. Another friend of ours helped me try to start and get him to start to be a bit more realistic, as he'd go years without one single girlfriend, he was lonely, and desparately wanted a woman to share his life with. Without every saying \"dude, lower your expectations\" we convinced him to talk to more and more girls who were more realistically in his range. He's now married with a great woman, and he still managed to marry up. She's a strong 7 with a bubbly personality, smart, and just plain a great lady.\n\n>Ironically the guy with all the upvotes, who is telling guys \"ya - you can get a 10!\" has a post history that's almost all porn. Point being, somebody's living in a fantasy world.\n\n---\n\nMy response:\n\n>Ironically the guy with all the upvotes, who is telling guys \"ya - you can get a 10!\" has a post history that's almost all porn. Point being, somebody's living in a fantasy world. \n\nFirst off, I guess you clearly haven't conceived of the fact that this might very well be my porn alt account, which I use specifically for visiting and commenting on porn subs. And that my main sub, just maybe, might have a shit tonne of karma talking about a lot of subjects other than porn.\n\nRE: getting 10s\n\n>Ironically the guy with all the upvotes, who is telling guys \"ya - you can get a 10!\" has a post history that's almost all porn. Point being, somebody's living in a fantasy world. \n\nIf you think that the main theme of what I'm telling guys here is that they can all get 10s, then once again, your reading comprehension is subpar.\n\nThe point is that guys who are 6s and 7s can get **reasonably attractive women**, and sometimes, on occasion, can get 8s and 9s. I never said you'll get 10s.\n\nAnd in any case, the core of the post is about the need for confidence, self-awareness and self-improvement, rather than sitting at home all day jerking off or browsing reddit or playing video games.\n\n>My wife and I know a woman who is at best a 4. My wife and I spent years trying to get her into a relationship - being a \"wing couple\" if you will. Her problem is every time we go out, all she's interested in is guys who are a 9 or a 10. \n\nOf course, the whole \"5s trying to get 10s\" thing is an issue. Of course you should not shoot too far out of your league, if you're a complete noob at approaching girls and currently do nothing but game and dress like a clown.\n\nGuys who are just starting out, or aren't super attractive, should absolutely go for girls that are more like 4s and 5s and 6s and 7s.\n\nBut my point is that with **personal improvement and hard work and interesting qualities and confidence a guy who is a 6 in the face in terms of looks can still land an 8 or a 9.** Though of course, it will be harder to do than land a 6 or 7, and will take *a lot of work*.\n\nYour example of a 45 year old cat lady who is a 4 is completely irrelevant. For one, let's go back ten years. Here she is 35 and a 4 in looks. Meanwhile she is completely disinterested in guys who are in her league, and is stupidly focusing just on way hotter guys.\n\nNot only is her looking at just hotter guys completely idiotic because guys care way more about appearance than girls do (yeah, they do), but she's also a **4 that is already 35.** Her age alone makes her massively less attractive to pretty much every guy out there. And this is backed up by research showing that men are still most attracted to women aged 18-26, even while they themselves age.\n\nThe fact that she is 45 and hitting on 35 year old male 10s is just insane. This woman is fucked, sadly. And not in the fun way.\n\nI'm glad your guy friend who was a 5 or 6 met a 7 and is happy.\n\nBut still, you're missing the point. \n\nIn **women's eyes**, a guy who starts out as a 5 in the looks department can **become a 7 or 8 or 9 overall by virtue of things like:**\n\n- confidence\n- sense of humour\n- sense of style (clothing awareness)\n- intelligence\n- discipline\n- drive\n- talent (artistic, musical, literary)\n- social capital (lots of friends/popularity/knowing cool people)\n- kindness (yes, it is a virture)\n- having a backbone (not taking shit - doesn't mean being an asshole)\n- courage\n- knowledge\n- good career\n- skill in a certain interesting area\n\nA man who is currently an obese, smelly gamer who is afraid of talking to girls **can actually turn himself into an 8 - in girl's eyes - by cultivating these attractive qualities**\n\nYeah, maybe at first he won't be able to land a girl that is an 8 or 9. Maybe he will settle with a 7. \n\nBut by being disciplined and hard working he can develop and improve his social value and ranking according to what girl's think of him - which does absolutely give him the chance of landing an 8 or 9. Maybe even a 10. Maybe just for sex, maybe for a relationship.\n\nWas every rich or talented guy who is not that great looking, yet has a 9 or ten for a girlfriend, *born* rich and talented? Or did they *grow to become rich and talented* through hard work, and maybe through things like confidence and sense of humour, etc.?\n\nIs Jerry Seinfeld a 10 in looks? He's barely a 6 or 7. Was he born rich? No. But he was hard working and creative and interesting and funny and now he is a billionaire who can fuck whatever model he wants.

And go out and start an innocent conversation with one new random girl everyday.\n\nIt doesn't matter if she's hot or not. Just strike up a mini short conversation with some random girl in your vicinity, even just for 20 seconds. If you're at a coffee shop and it's not super busy, maybe start up a conversation with the barista, instead of shyly mumbling your order, avoiding eye contact, and shuffling away like a bridge troll.\n\nOr do the same with a girl working the desk at the library. Obviously don't just stop a girl on the street. That's sketchy. But it's okay to smile, make eye contact, and make small talk if you're somewhere in public and the girl looks open to being approached. Maybe say something to the girl next to you before class starts. Whatever.\n\nDon't even do this with any expectation of getting a number or a date. Just make having a light, brief conversation with a girl you don't know your goal.\n\nDo this enough, and you'll notice your anxiety will decrease each time you talk to a new woman. And eventually, you'll realize girls are just people too, and you'll be able to strike up a conversation with anyone.\n\nNo matter what stupid teen movies or romantic comedies try to tell you, **women are not generally attracted to feeble, timid men who mumble, are shy, and are afraid of talking to them.**\n\nIt's just pathetic. Really. Why would a woman be impressed by or attracted to a man who is scared to talk to her, and instead is just pining for her from afar, or doing favours for her in the hopes that she'll eventually see that he's \"not like those other guys\" ? (Meanwhile he is, because he also just wants to get laid, but unlike them, is too scared to tell her how he feels, whether he has romantic feelings, or just wants to have sex with her).\n\nSo if you are currently afraid of approaching girls you don't know or girls you like, or think are hot, well stop that. Right now. Cause it's not attractive. And start making the change. No matter how much it will initially hurt to get rejected.

I put that in my original post. Here is what I wrote:\n\n---\n\nAll you have to do is:\n\n- have some self-confidence; \n- be somewhat funny (and it actually doesn't take much to make a girl laugh, it's more in being confident with your delivery); \n- be somewhat interesting in that you read or play an instrument or are intelligent or write or just do **some type of hobby other than playing video games, or redditing or jerking off all day** (not that you can't play games at all);\n- know the basics of how to not dress like a clueless child; \n- **maybe go to the gym once in a while (though girls care less about appearance than men, and if you are fat, but interesting and funny you can still get a date with a cute girl);**\n- and learn to not be afraid to go up to attractive girls knowing that you might get rejected, and continue to approach other girls in a non-creepy way and talk to them and ask them out, until you realize that you aren't going to die from rejection. And that even if 9 girls turn you down when you ask for a number, there still might be a 10th girl that would say yes.\n\n--- \n\nWhen I mentioned going to the gym \"once in a while\" I'm not trying to downplay that this means semi-regularly. I.E. that you should at least try to get to an average level of fitness, i.e. not overweight, or at least not obese.\n\nThis dude in the pic is extremely obese, and if he were a \"normal person\" (this guy is a semi famous extra in movies), he would probably be afraid of girls, dress horribly, have bad hygiene, and his interests would be limited to Magic the Gathering, WoW, and his katana collection.\n\nNo, he would not be able to get a hot girl or average girl in this hypothetical current obese nerdish state.\n\nBut if he hit the gym and lost 100 lbs and got to a reasonable bmi; maybe started playing the guitar or went to painting classes where he could meet people; worked hard to get out of his shell and talk to girls; join clubs to meet people and develop more interests; started messaging girls on POF or OkCupid within his league to build confidence; learned how to dress;  and maybe got rid of the swords and sold his toys and cut back a bit on the WoW raiding so he could have time and money to go to bars and pickup girls...\n\n***maybe he could turn INTO a guy that could get that hot big tittied girl in the picture.***", "id": "d7huttl"}, {"comment": "Then I agree with you, i'm sick of people pretending physical appearance doesn't matter when it comes to relationships, people tend to take notice of the exterior AND the interior but nobody likes to accept that.", "id": "d7hvma6"}, {"comment": "Ok good.

Physical fitness and appearance is one part, and it does matter to girls. And yes they do drool over ripped guys. But in real life women seem to be happy with average-bodied (not necessarilly out of shape dad-bods, but not 8 pack ripped either, just average) guys, but **who have a whole tonne of other attractive qualities as well.** And those other qualities - if a guy develops them - can turn a dude who is a 6 in looks into an 8 overall, who can pick up girls that are 8s.\n\nStill, if a guy is morbidly obese and doesn't have a very handsome face, he is like a 2 in looks at best. He would have to work his ass off and lose 100 of more pounds just to get to level 6 in looks. But while he's doing that, he could be developing other qualities that make him more awesome and attractive.\n\nMeanwhile guys care about how the girl looks as the number 1 priority, and everything else second. It's why dudes will constantly be willing to struggle to look past jealous, controlling, narcissistic psycho bitch behavior from a girl if she's a 9 if it means he gets to fuck her on occasion.\n\nBut it's really just like a gender attractiveness scale, where qualities like looks or intelligence are weighted differently and have different levels of value depending on gender.", "id": "d7hw4xy"}, {"comment": "> learn to not be afraid to go up to attractive girls knowing that you might get rejected, and continue to approach other girls in a non-creepy way \n\nThis essentially is the best piece of advise.

Was at work.\n\nEdit from the Wiki\n\n> \"Mulva\"\nUnable to remember the name of the woman he is dating (played by Susan Walters), Jerry tries to solve the mystery, as he is too late to simply ask her. Given the clue that her name rhymes with a part of the female anatomy, Jerry and George come up with possible candidates: Aretha (for urethra), Celeste and Hest (for breast), and Bovary (for ovary), and finally George suggests Mulva. The payoff to the joke comes at the end of the episode when she presses him to say her name. Jerry guesses Mulva (for vulva), causing her to storm out of Jerry's apartment. As she is leaving, Jerry incorrectly guesses another name, Gipple (for nipple) and Loleola (for areola). Then, in a flash of insight, Jerry runs to the window and yells \"Dolores!\" (rhyming with a common pronunciation of clitoris). The character returns in season 8's \"The Foundation\". In this later episode, George and Jerry refer to Dolores as Mulva among themselves.", "id": "d9zcm5m"}, {"comment": "I remember the episode, I just don't see how you could have thought that it was a Seinfeld reference.

It brought about my first real inquiries into the biological form of the human being. Two arms, two legs, and, up to this point, two nipples.
