From what I see in the pic, your hairline seems to be receiding which is exactly a sign of high DHT as well as your high body hair growth.

Keto worked really well for me because the appetite/craving/blood sugar control is really powerful\u2014I always felt super stressed about tracking when I did ordinary low-calorie, because when you're this short your calorie budget is tiny and the margin for error is very small. I was always obsessing about what I was going to eat next and never felt very satisfied.\n\nKeto really helped me sort out mental hunger vs real hunger and helped me understand satiety cues and how much was really enough. Coupled with more strength training, it kind of shifted my thinking about food to more of a need-based fueling approach. Does that make sense? Learning what actually satisfied me helped me untangle my emotional attachment to it, which helped me not feel like I had to keep such white-knuckle control on it.\n\nIt WAS hard for me at first to get used to smaller-volume meals of calorie-dense foods; I was used to years of trying to get as much volume for as few calories as possible and thought \"full\" and \"not hungry\" we're the same thing. That was hard to unlearn and I had a couple of false starts until I gave myself a week to eat literally whatever I wanted but keeping carbs very, very low. That helped me break habits left over from low-fat low-calorie and taught me more about what an actual self-regulated portion looked like, giving me confidence that I could do this without going insane or giving up bc I wanted to just eat t-bones all day like it seemed everyone else on keto was doing--turns out i actually couldnt eat that much without feeling sick if i was really paying attention and being honest about why I was eating.\n\nThe last piece for me was adding intermittent fasting to drop the last couple of pounds and maintain. I thought it would be too big of a lifestyle change for me and avoided it for a long time, but I've only seen positives--mostly time/money/mental energy savings and the mental satisfaction of pretty much being able to eat however much of whatever I want if I only eat once a day. It's much easier for me to stay at maintenance TDEE levels without tracking if I eat once a day vs three or four times, and I find it a very sustainable and surprisingly flexible way to maintain without too much stress. At this point I mostly take an 80/20 approach with everything and find it easy-ish to naturally shift something else in reaction if I eat a lot one day, decide to have a serving of pasta, or whatever.\n\nI still weigh myself about once a week; I have a five pound window I try to stay inside. If I drop below I eat a little more (race season is gearing up and I have to consciously add calories as I up my running mileage). If I creep above I cut out drinking for a couple of days. \n\nSorry for the wall of text.

I've always been a hobbyist distance runner (up to marathon distances, half marathon is my fave, though). I usually train for and run one big race in the spring and one in the fall.

I eat back running calories at about 70 extra per mile, I don't consider it a way to add to my calorie deficit for the day...so I usually use those calories strictly as pre- or post-run fuel and not part of my \"regular\" diet, otherwise it's way too easy to slip back into \"oh I worked out today I should TREAT MYSELF\". \n\nTo be honest, my running really suffered for a solid two months when I first stared eating keto, I was used to popping energy gels and sports drinks right and left. It took really clean, disciplined eating and suffering through a lot of crappy workouts before I felt like fat adaptation was complete and was benefiting me.

But I definitely noticed an energy \"gap\" after I stopped eating carbs in my diet/as fuel during exercise but before I was fully, efficiently fat-adapted. There's a lot more science out there on this stuff than I ever dug into, so my advice is based on my experience only...I would say keep your eating really clean so you're not dipping in and out all the time, run only much as you want to (you'll probably be pretty tired the first couple weeks) but enough not to lose fitness, don't beat yourself up if it sucks the first little bit, and it will feel great again in a couple of months.", "id": "cz35zow"}, {"comment": "Thanks!

Just wow.  That's amazing.  You weigh about HALF of what you did just 8 months ago.  \n\nWe need some cool term of respect for ketoers like you who successfully shed massive amounts of weight and transform themselves into healthier people thereby.  Maybe \"Titans\" or something.  I'm being serious here.  To turn yourself around that dramatically and head in a healthy direction is truly worthy of respect.  I'll venture it deserves more respect than run-of-the-mill weight loss. You're doing something extraordinary that most people believe isn't even possible.  That makes you different from most people: you *know* from experience how you can change yourself, and how to persevere. \n\nYou?  You're a *titan*.  Different from the rest of us.   Better, I suspect, for the experience.   You may feel depression, sure.  But MY GOD MAN look at what you have managed in 8 short months!  You should hold your head up high.  You are better than you were, and getting better by the day.  It doesn't matter where we are, it matters where we are headed.  You, by virtue of your own choices, are heading in exactly the right direction.  You are making yourself an example for others, an example of how to do that most difficult thing: *change*. \n\n/salute"], [97, "finally someone heavier than me at a starting weight :-P\n\nI say that in jest fyi.

I can't even imagine how you must feel physically to have lost so much.\n\nI read a post recently about someone who had lost 10 lbs and while not thinking it was much, a friend of his helped him visualize that he had lost the equivalent of a sack of potatoes. You have lost over 30 sacks of potatoes in weight! Just picture that! Truly amazing! You should really feel proud of your accomplishment so far. Just keep going. You're the man!!\n\nEdit: And FYI..

Reading through the comments, and seeing your sense of humor (sardonic = good), I'm even more excited for your future. Please update this thread and let us know how you are doing today.\n\nYour accomplishment, ESPECIALLY when dealing with depression, is nothing short of extraordinary. \n\nIf I can give you one piece of advice about depression, which runs in my family, and which I have dealt with, off and on, my whole life, it's this: depression isn't caused by situations. It's caused by how we respond to a situation. The one constant that has helped me when I've been there is to daily take the time to list the things that I'm grateful for. Corny, right? But it works. \n\nThe year that I got laid off for the second time in two years, and had been very ill for three months, I moped around the house until I made myself do this. Every morning, I got up 15 minutes early, and went and sat where I could look out the window. Then started telling myself all the good things in my life. The sun had come up. I had cats on my lap. There was food in my frig, and, even though it was cold outside, I was comfortable. I had people who cared about me. On and on. Big, little: if it impacted my life for the better, I listed it. \n\nAnd it helped. I still do it, because it's not like, once we get through depression, that we won't go back, ever, is it? Please take the time to be grateful to YOURSELF for caring enough to take such a positive step toward being healthy and happy."], [1, "You have no reason to be depressed in my eyes.

You weigh about HALF of what you did just 8 months ago.  \n\nWe need some cool term of respect for ketoers like you who successfully shed massive amounts of weight and transform themselves into healthier people thereby.  Maybe \"Titans\" or something.  I'm being serious here.  To turn yourself around that dramatically and head in a healthy direction is truly worthy of respect.  I'll venture it deserves more respect than run-of-the-mill weight loss. You're doing something extraordinary that most people believe isn't even possible.  That makes you different from most people: you *know* from experience how you can change yourself, and how to persevere. \n\nYou?  You're a *titan*.  Different from the rest of us.   Better, I suspect, for the experience.   You may feel depression, sure.  But MY GOD MAN look at what you have managed in 8 short months!  You should hold your head up high.  You are better than you were, and getting better by the day.  It doesn't matter where we are, it matters where we are headed.  You, by virtue of your own choices, are heading in exactly the right direction.

It's caused by how we respond to a situation. The one constant that has helped me when I've been there is to daily take the time to list the things that I'm grateful for. Corny, right? But it works. \n\nThe year that I got laid off for the second time in two years, and had been very ill for three months, I moped around the house until I made myself do this. Every morning, I got up 15 minutes early, and went and sat where I could look out the window. Then started telling myself all the good things in my life. The sun had come up. I had cats on my lap. There was food in my frig, and, even though it was cold outside, I was comfortable. I had people who cared about me. On and on. Big, little: if it impacted my life for the better, I listed it. \n\nAnd it helped. I still do it, because it's not like, once we get through depression, that we won't go back, ever, is it?

After traveling for work pretty much all of October and getting hit pretty hard by what I can assume was the winter blues (SAD) I started to have issues keeping my calories down.  I finally cracked over Christmas and had a carb binge, before that binge I still managed my carb intake.  It doesn\u2019t show it in the chart but I actually got up to 268 after that binge.  Once January came around I finally started feeling like my old self and began to turn things back around.  This little binge really showed me that I really was/am addicted to food and it is really easy to fall back into that hole.\n\n\nHere is my [FIRST POST]( https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/3hugwo/pics_200_days_of_keto_141_pounds/) if anyone wants to see my lipid panel results.

Once January came around I finally started feeling like my old self and began to turn things back around.  This little binge really showed me that I really was/am addicted to food and it is really easy to fall back into that hole.\n\n\nHere is my [FIRST POST]( https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/3hugwo/pics_200_days_of_keto_141_pounds/) if anyone wants to see my lipid panel results.

This stuff is everywhere. But it doesn't stop there. Our schools and workplaces are filled with vending machines and sponsored content (misinformation), and healthful options for eating are limited or nonexistent in many places. The prevailing knowledge of nutrition is severely impeded by a systematic misinformation campaign in the profit interests of the various food industries.\n\nNow, some of us realize this for what it is -- entrapment and poisoning. That's great, and in recent years the number has surely been growing. More and more people are skeptical of GMO technology (a different discussion, perhaps), for example. People are beginning to see through the propagandistic lies about sugar (a dangerous and extremely addictive substance) and dietary fat. But it remains that even a person with a working knowledge of these issues is perhaps at a loss to affect much change without alternatives available.\n\nSelf control plays a part in all of this, of course, but the dominant culture (if you want to use that word) is a haze of half truths and incredibly dangerous misconceptions. If one is fortunate enough to have emerged from this, then I commend them, and ask that they simply share their reasoning and methods with the world (\"I figured it out so so should you\" doesn't cut it).

Better than the oven, but still really dry (obviously). \n\nI recently learned about the double frying method.

This is how I do it every time now.. they are so juicy and delicious, they really taste like restaurant bought. \n\nFor sauce, we go traditional 99% of the time.. for 20 wings we do about a half cup of Red Hot with about a tablespoon of butter.  Melt the butter, stir in the hot sauce, put wings and sauce in a bowl with a lid, shake it up, place on plate with copious amounts of blue cheese and tada! Delicious wings.\n\nFor a much higher calorie, but incredibly delicious batch, we have done garlic parmesan wings - 1/4C butter melted, 1t garlic powder, 1/2t onion salt, 1/4 black pepper, 1/2C grated parmesan - whisk it together, dump in covered bowl with cooked wings, shake it up, yum!

Nice lady, her card has her name: Susan xxxxxxx, RD, LD, CDE, diabetes education program coordinator, / Bariatric Nutrition Counseling.   It took me a week to get in to see her, and during that week I Had started doing keto.   \n\nSo on the day of the appointment she gave me a glucometer, and showed me how to use it.   I showed her my food logs, which she said were great but she suggested that I could eat more carbs, and that I should be adding 3 portions of fruit a day.   Suggested that I eat oatmeal for breakfast daily, and also that I should add a serving of whole grain bread daily.  I told her that I was trying to reduce my carb intake to lower my blood sugar  (which when she tested me with the glucometer it was 92 well within normal range )\nShe replied by saying that reducing my carb intake was a good idea, but I could still eat a few more carbs if I wanted to.  She then went on to the subject of bariatric surgery.  \n\nI left there somewhat annoyed, she'd given me a handful of leaflets about what diabetes is, and how it worked, and a stack of leaflets about bariatric surgery.  She also had signed me up for a \"weight loss education class\", that met once a month.  I was very let down, I expected her to drop some serious knowledge & diet science on me, but I have seen more thorough posts here in this sub.  So I resolved to KCKO and reserve judgement until I wen't to the weight loss class.   I had lost 10 lbs in the week between initial diagnosis and visiting her I might add.\n\nWeight Loss education class day:   I arrive about 15 minutes early, greet Susan XXXXXXX, and another lady.   They weigh you and by this time I have lost 20 lbs in total.   So I pull out a pen and some paper, and settle in to wait for the other students to arrive.   Eventually they show up, and the \"diabetes educator's\" star the class.  They fire up an overhead projector, and hand out a couple pamphlets, and they give some really lame diet advice for about 2 minutes.   Next they start talking about bariatric surgery, and what you can expect.  Total class time lasts about 10 minutes and see you all next month.    Again i'm leaving and i'm totally let down, I did not expect another infomercial about the lap band, and I've heard better diet advice in weight watcher's meetings.  In fact weight watchers meetings were generally better put together, and they had much nicer materials.  \n\nI completely forget about going the next month, and after that cancel my \"appointment\" to go to that class anymore.   I also discovered that Insurance would not pay for those classes and it cost $200 PER FUCKING CLASS!  I had to pay for the second one because I didn't cancel it.\n\nThe state of healthcare in this country is pretty screwed up.  \nWe have an epidemic of diabetes and obesity and this helpful?\n\nI am so glad I found this sub, I'm glad OP's Wife found this sub.   \nThe medical community at large needs to adopt this stuff.", "id": "d1o2pfy"}, {"comment": "That's terrifying!

It's a weight gain and health worst case scenario, it's about as addictive as anything can be, and it's absolutely everywhere.\n\nI didn't know any of this when I first tried to stop drinking it. All I knew was drinking it, despite craving it, made me feel really bad. Plus I was broke at the time and that was a really obvious place to cut spending.

Eventually weeks turned into months.\n\nI'm not sure when it happened exactly but I started to be able to actually taste food. It was actually quite bizarre at first. Tomatoes tasted like candy. I wasn't just mechanically chewing and swallowing meat, I could feel the juicy fat hitting my taste buds giving me an unfamiliar satisfying feeling. Real food tasted good, not just the modern superstimuli we call food.\n\nWeight loss followed and I just felt better all around. Some time later I found keto.

I talk about my diet change to anyone who will listen and even some who won't.\n\nFinding an excuse to drink a soda is mindbogglingly easy. We're hard coded to stuff ourselves with sugar.

While it is likely this is more an electrolyte issue, here are some examples below which can cause hypoglycemic symptoms even in fat adapted people. \n\nSome people have a certain genotype of the FTO gene in which elevated levels of dietary saturated fat increases their fasting insulin, making them even more susceptible to drops and spikes in blood sugar. The solution to this is to greatly increase PUFA and MUFA intake, while lowering saturated fat intake. Still keto, just different fat sources. \n\nTo throw another wrench, the above can be combined with a specific genotype on PPAR gamma that increases overall insulin sensitivity in muscle tissue and the liver.

My interpretation is that keto helps me by controlling very bad harmful microbes, but that it happened to liberate some other microbes that like coconut oil, blueberries and avocado.

When mine dropped from 6 pounds a week to 3 I felt like I had let myself down, but you gotta rationalize it. You are still losing and that is always a good thing! And remember, it fluctuates. Daily weight changes 2-4 pounds depending on water retention or other bodily factors.\n\nIf you're desperate to kick it up a bit more, I can give you a tip that works amazingly well (which i learned from a pro bodybuilder & Mr. Australia finalist a few years ago). Instead of the usual 3 meals per day, do 6 instead. Cut down your big 3 into a smaller 3 with 2-3 snack periods between/after meals (a handful of almonds, some low carb jello, maybe a hard-boiled egg). A metabolism that is constantly being fed burns more, and by stoking that fire every 2.5 to 3 hours you can keep optimal burning. Also assess your caloric intake. For us larger few the calculator will recommend 2200+ (2600 for me) but I have always felt well stocked with food at 1700-1800 max. Try that amount, but up it if you're feeling more hungry. A higher deficit will always mean a higher loss, but don't go overboard, and make sure you always hit your protein level.

Tell us please, OP!", "id": "d2m2ar9"}, {"comment": "If I can cobble together pics I'll update this post, but I did keto for several years ultimately taking my BF% to about 13% from over 40%. I'm a short guy, but I lost nearly 100 lbs.  I lived my life basically doing \"in-a-pinch\" things. \n\nMy go-to anytime snack was a protein shake, made with \"carbmaster\" milk. Again, if I feel un-lazy and update this post, I'll go get the macros. But the milk is lactose free, unsweetened, and protein enriched, something like 11g of protein. \n\nOther than that, I ate: So much cheese. I would buy blocks and snack on them either cutting them in to cubes, slices, or big chunks. Alongside cheese, I would snack on any kind of snacking meats (pepperoni, salami, beef), sunflower seeds, almonds, thousands of pickles, and most of all bacon. I got a microwave bacon tray, and any time I needed something quick to hold me over, I'd nuke two slices of bacon for all that fat/protein. \n\nAs far as actual \"meals\"  my favorite quick-time snack was:\n\nlay out sliced turkey like a tortilla wrap. Fill it with:bacon, cheese, mayo, horseradish, lettuce, and cream cheese. Roll it up and eat it. Takes all of 3 minutes (including the bacon) and was always good. \n\nI grilled lots of burgers. And fast-food was always a burger without ketchup and I'd remove the bun.  Think two McDoubles, no ketchup, removed the buns, stack it all together, think about something else while you try to pallet it, and move on. \n\nQuick breakfast? Sausage and egg muffins, remove muffins, eat rest. \n\nQuick \"real\" meal? I kept frozen fish fillets in the freezer. You can buy a huge bag of salmon/cod/tillapia from any supermarket. They cook from frozen. You can have a nice fish meal in about 15 minutes, just pan fry in olive oil, add some butter/cream for a sauce if you want, season that thing up and eat it. Quite good really. \n\nOh and tuna. Lots of mf tuna. Tuna with egg and mayo. Pretty damn good. \n\nSpeaking of which eggs. I eat eggs like they are going out of style. Got an egg nuker, too. Makes poached eggs in a minute. Slap some cheese on while it's still hot and it melts all around it, eat it up. Simple.  Nuke a bacon, stack that on, and its great. Fry up some sausage and toss it all together, and bam! kick it up a notch. \n\nI ate a shit-ton of salads, too. I would fill a bowl up about 3/4 with just plain lettuce (no high-carb salad stuff, like tomatoes, croutons, carrots, etc.) Then I'd add either turkey, chicken, cheese, bacon, \"crisped cheese,\" sunflower seeds, peperoni, things like that. Then I'd use a very delicious caser dressing since it's increadbily low in carbs and high in fat. \n\nMy key to success was measuring anything I knew was \"heavy carb\" out with either a spoon, cup, or scale (like the salad dressing).  Same with almonds. I bought a bunch of little containers from the dollar store, and on sunday would make up about 14 single serving containers of almonds I could just grab as I wanted, but knew never to eat more than two containers a day. \n\nGet creative. I ate a lot of nukeable veggies like broccoli and green beans. Again, watching the sugar, trying to use mostly fresh/frozen if I could (I think canned has more sugar preservatives maybe driving up the carb count slightly, but I have nothing to go off of). \n\nLoad up on ground beef.  If I was cooking spaghetti for my family, I'd set aside some of the meats for the sauce and make my own \"spaghetti\" using green beans instead of noodles. Never as good, but it kept me losing weight. \n\n", "id": "d2m45yl"}, {"comment": "You are just amazing for sharing all of that. Thank you so very much!", "id": "d2mjaip"}, {"comment": "No problem!

Dinners usually include meat, sometimes fatty, sometimes boneless skinless chicken (perhaps if I had six slices of bacon with cream cheese for breakfast?). With all of this, I still stay under 1300 calories (or 1300+exercise calories, if I'm hungry). That's what I love about keto - most of my hunger is gone! I can indulge in bacon and butter in moderation and not go overboard! It's all about balance. Want butter and bacon for a meal? Have a less fatty meal later!

Because the liver is producing glucose, oxaloacetate is depleted. When OA is depleted AcetylCoA builds up during fatty acid oxidation, it builds up because it can't enter the TCA (no oxaloacetate). The liver deals with this by exporting AcetylCoA in the form of acetoacetate.\n\nThere is usually no huge discussion of this because it is undergraduate biochemistry.\n\n> A major determinant of the pathway taken by acetyl-CoA in liver mitochondria is the availability of oxaloacetate to initiate entry of acetyl-CoA into the citric acid cycle. Under some circumstances (such as ~~starvation~~ during a ketogenic diet) oxaloacetate is drawn out of the citric acid cycle for use in synthesizing glucose. When the oxaloacetate concentration is very low, little acetyl-CoA enters the cycle, and ketone body formation is favored. The production and export of ketone bodies from the liver to extrahepatic tissues allows continued oxidation of fatty acids in the liver when acetyl-CoA is not being oxidized via the citric acid cycle. Overproduction of ketone bodies can occur in conditions of severe starvation and in uncontrolled diabetes.\n\nhttp://www.bioinfo.org.cn/book/biochemistry/chapt16/bio4.htm\n\nThis is confirmed by Peter Dobromylskyj:\n\n> Clearly any amino acid which metabolises to oxaloacetate within the liver is simply going to remove that void in the citric acid cycle (oxaloacetate deficiency) which results in acetyl-CoA being diverted to ketogenesis. Aspartate is one such. Those metabolising to pyruvate are also going to do essentially the same thing. There is no need for increased gluconeogenesis in this scenario. \n\nhttp://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.ch/2015/02/ketosis-and-protein.html", "id": "cz3p15b"}, {"comment": "You also need a large amount of protein for this to become an issue, which most would find difficult to achieve.

Some people have this idea that \"the less carbs the better!\" and sometimes seek a near 0 carb approach, but this is honestly more stressful because they are relying on gluconeogenesis, rather than having it available as a failsafe,because MOST of your protein intake should be for muscle sparring maintenance\n\nTo better answer your question: energy can come from fat molecules in the form of ketones, which are a certain type of energy storing molecule, but bar none ketones are NOT glucose molecules. Certain metabolic pathways require energy, which ketones provide. However, certain metabolic pathways do require the glucose molecule, specifically, and not simply just energy. This is where proteins come in, because proteins can be broken down literally into glucose molecules, which is different than simply becoming an \"energy\" molecule like ketones.

The problem is not willpower or rationality. It's about carbs flooding your bloodstream with insulin that tells fat cells to bulk up. That's what make you hungry and lethargic.\n\nCalories out cannot be controlled independently from what you eat. Calories out depends on what you eat. If you eat carbs, calories out is lower than if you don't. Anyway, if it really is about caloric deficit--why not just do Weightwatchers?

Like it or not, for many people it's not just about insulin and leptin - many people don't just eat when they're hungry (or even fake \"hungry\"); there's a complex web of environmental, behavioral, emotional, whatever influencers that lead to the decision to put something into your mouth or not. If you're prone to eating for any other reason than true hunger, hearing \"eat whatever you want as long as it's not carbs\" doesn't exactly set you up to fix those other issues - and you'll never get to a point where you can even pay attention to satiety.\n\nI actually agree that calorie counting as a management system has some inherent flaws. But. Even Taubes agrees that the core problem is an over abundance of fuel for the body (regardless of how it was delivered/efficiency of metabolization) and a failure in the systems that signal enough. I believe that restricting carbs fixes those systems - it did for me, better than ordinary low-calorie ever did - but it takes time, and for many people like me the physiological response is not the only piece at play.

I had estimated my body fat percentage when I started, by the time I lost 20 pounds I bought a 5 or 10 dollar caliper on Amazon. It isn't perfect but it gave me a pretty good idea of the transformation. I can't recommend this enough to people, track body fat percentage and scale but the bf is so much more informative.\n\nAnyway, I found I had lost more like 23-25 pounds of fat with some measurement tolerances. That means I actually put on several pounds of lean mass relative to my start weight. Where as most diets total weight loss includes the catabolic loss of lean mass as well so just looking at total weight loss kind of penalizes you for gaining lean mass. Now if you also consider I probably lost 3-7 pounds of water weight in that first week it means I put more like 5-10 pounds of actual lean mass on. This makes a huge difference in your body shape because you most likely lost say 30 pounds but you've been building lean mass on top so it looks like more because it is!\n\nGreat job"], [2, "Whats your daily diet like?

I can't recommend this enough to people, track body fat percentage and scale but the bf is so much more informative.\n\nAnyway, I found I had lost more like 23-25 pounds of fat with some measurement tolerances. That means I actually put on several pounds of lean mass relative to my start weight. Where as most diets total weight loss includes the catabolic loss of lean mass as well so just looking at total weight loss kind of penalizes you for gaining lean mass. Now if you also consider I probably lost 3-7 pounds of water weight in that first week it means I put more like 5-10 pounds of actual lean mass on. This makes a huge difference in your body shape because you most likely lost say 30 pounds but you've been building lean mass on top so it looks like more because it is!\n\nGreat job", "id": "d6xolz1"}], [{"comment": "Whats your daily diet like?

This happened because I was finding it so difficult to control my eating when all week I'd watch him eat pizzas, McDonalds, Wendy's, KFC, etc...and I'd be so tempted to have a fry, have a chip, just a bite of pizza.

When him and I met I was 220 lbs, had lost 15 lbs before meeting him.  When I noticed my body was a big turn off for him I asked him about it.  He said me being fat wasn't attractive to him.  A lot of people criticize him for saying that but it really motivated me to lose weight, which I did, nearly 90 lbs.  At that time we weren't living together and only saw each other on weekends.  He would make fun of me for eating at the same Greek restaurant every Saturday, but I didn't care, it was \"eating out\" and healthy (salad with BBQ chicken and tzatziki sauce). \n\nThen he moved in and my weight ended up going into a plateau, then I slowly gained 15 lbs.  Not because my body stopped losing weight but because I found myself cheating every weekend.  This happened because I was finding it so difficult to control my eating when all week I'd watch him eat pizzas, McDonalds, Wendy's, KFC, etc...and I'd be so tempted to have a fry, have a chip, just a bite of pizza.  Then I couldn't stand it anymore and I'd end up cheating Friday to Sunday.  \n\nHe recently moved out and I'm finding myself so much more motivated to continue on Keto and not cheat.

To my understanding (those more knowledgeable than I please interject) is that when you have glucose in your blood and no insulin to help your body absorb it, you are not able to break that down into energy. Your liver then recognizes the fact that you have sugar in your blood, signaling no energy, and releases stored ketones to be used as energy. A normal endocrine system acknowledges the ketones and says \"yo, insulin time!\" And gives you the hormone to help break down the glucose into energy. Here lies he diabetic problem: our bodies do not produce insulin. So, as the liver realizes there is still no energy being broken down (still reads glucose in your Blood), it continues to spill ketones into your blood stream, at an accelerating rate. It's like a closed loop system, your liver keeps identifying more sugar and no insulIN so it keeps spitting out ketones. Ketones in large amounts change the pH of your blood, and that is why causes significant short term damage, sending you into DKA. \n\nAll bodies, diabetic or not, are able to handle ketones. As a diabetic, we've been told ketones are bad as they've only been associated with DKA in our lives. And they are, in large amount. However, ketones as a by product of fat used for energy is not dangerous - our bodies are just as capable of handling these ketones on a safe manner. \n\n\nOf course: I am NOT a doctor.

Unfortunately if you have 0 insulin then everything is up shit creek no matter what it tries. The liver being not an advanced diagnostic intelligence, it keeps on trying anyway, and ketone bodies will build up in your blood stream while you eventually slip into a coma from lack of energy to the brain.\n\n\"Nutritional\" Ketosis is what's happening when everything is under control. Your body is now using the alternate ketosis metabolism successfully, but you're still producing a low amount of insulin that is always necessary for us to function (note, diabetics with completely destroyed pancreas function will still have to inject this basal level of insulin). This small amount of insulin will always be enough to stop the process careening out of control as what happened in the previous paragraph.\n\nHowever your friend will have only been informed of the former, (rightly) really worrying form.\n\nBecause ketosis requires a lower and less varying level of insulin to maintain than glucose metabolism, I'd argue it's actually easier and safer to maintain.", "id": "d0cxkfa"}, {"comment": "Great explanation, thank you!

", "id": "d7lvj3g"}, {"comment": "The sugar industry paid scientists in the 1960s to play down the link between sugar and heart disease and promote saturated fat as the culprit instead, newly released historical documents show.\n\nThe internal sugar industry documents, recently discovered by a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, and published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, suggest that five decades of research into the role of nutrition and heart disease, including many of today\u2019s dietary recommendations, may have been largely shaped by the sugar industry.\n\n\u201cThey were able to derail the discussion about sugar for decades,\u201d said Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at U.C.S.F. and an author of the JAMA Internal Medicine paper.\n\nThe documents show that a trade group called the Sugar Research Foundation, known today as the Sugar Association, paid three Harvard scientists the equivalent of about $50,000 in today\u2019s dollars to publish a 1967 review of research on sugar, fat and heart disease. The studies used in the review were handpicked by the sugar group, and the article, which was published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, minimized the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspersions on the role of saturated fat.\n\nEven though the influence-peddling revealed in the documents dates back nearly 50 years, more recent reports show that the food industry has continued to influence nutrition science.\n\nLast year, an article in The New York Times revealed that Coca-Cola, the world\u2019s largest producer of sugary beverages, had provided millions of dollars in funding to researchers who sought to play down the link between sugary drinks and obesity. In June, The Associated Press reported that candy makers were funding studies that claimed that children who eat candy tend to weigh less than those who do not.\n\nThe Harvard scientists and the sugar executives with whom they collaborated are no longer alive. One of the scientists who was paid by the sugar industry was D. Mark Hegsted, who went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where in 1977 he helped draft the forerunner to the federal government\u2019s dietary guidelines. Another was Dr. Fredrick J. Stare, the chairman of Harvard\u2019s nutrition department.\nContinue reading the main story\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story\n\nIn a statement responding to the JAMA journal report, the Sugar Association said that the 1967 review was published at a time when medical journals did not typically require researchers to disclose funding sources. The New England Journal of Medicine did not begin to require financial disclosures until 1984.\n\nThe industry \u201cshould have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities,\u201d the Sugar Association statement said. Even so, it defended industry-funded research as playing an important and informative role in scientific debate. It said that several decades of research had concluded that sugar \u201cdoes not have a unique role in heart disease.\u201d\n\nThe revelations are important because the debate about the relative harms of sugar and saturated fat continues today, Dr. Glantz said. For many decades, health officials encouraged Americans to reduce their fat intake, which led many people to consume low-fat, high-sugar foods that some experts now blame for fueling the obesity crisis.\n\n\u201cIt was a very smart thing the sugar industry did, because review papers, especially if you get them published in a very prominent journal, tend to shape the overall scientific discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Hegsted used his research to influence the government\u2019s dietary recommendations, which emphasized saturated fat as a driver of heart disease while largely characterizing sugar as empty calories linked to tooth decay. Today, the saturated fat warnings remain a cornerstone of the government\u2019s dietary guidelines, though in recent years the American Heart Association, the World Health Organization and other health authorities have also begun to warn that too much added sugar may increase cardiovascular disease risk.\n\nMarion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, wrote an editorial accompanying the new paper in which she said the documents provided \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d that the sugar industry had initiated research \u201cexpressly to exonerate sugar as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s appalling,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just never see examples that are this blatant.\u201d\n\nDr. Walter Willett, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said that academic conflict-of-interest rules had changed significantly since the 1960s, but that the industry papers were a reminder of \u201cwhy research should be supported by public funding rather than depending on industry funding.\u201d\n\nDr. Willett said the researchers had limited data to assess the relative risks of sugar and fat. \u201cGiven the data that we have today, we have shown the refined carbohydrates and especially sugar-sweetened beverages are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but that the type of dietary fat is also very important,\u201d he said.\n\nThe JAMA Internal Medicine paper relied on thousands of pages of correspondence and other documents that Cristin E. Kearns, a postdoctoral fellow at U.C.S.F., discovered in archives at Harvard, the University of Illinois and other libraries.\n\nThe documents show that in 1964, John Hickson, a top sugar industry executive, discussed a plan with others in the industry to shift public opinion \u201cthrough our research and information and legislative programs.\u201d\n\nAt the time, studies had begun pointing to a relationship between high-sugar diets and the country\u2019s high rates of heart disease. At the same time, other scientists, including the prominent Minnesota physiologist Ancel Keys, were investigating a competing theory that it was saturated fat and dietary cholesterol that posed the biggest risk for heart disease.\n\nMr. Hickson proposed countering the alarming findings on sugar with industry-funded research. \u201cThen we can publish the data and refute our detractors,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn 1965, Mr. Hickson enlisted the Harvard researchers to write a review that would debunk the anti-sugar studies. He paid them a total of $6,500, the equivalent of $49,000 today. Mr. Hickson selected the papers for them to review and made it clear he wanted the result to favor sugar.\n\nHarvard\u2019s Dr. Hegsted reassured the sugar executives. \u201cWe are well aware of your particular interest,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand will cover this as well as we can.\u201d\n\nAs they worked on their review, the Harvard researchers shared and discussed early drafts with Mr. Hickson, who responded that he was pleased with what they were writing. The Harvard scientists had dismissed the data on sugar as weak and given far more credence to the data implicating saturated fat.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you this is quite what we had in mind, and we look forward to its appearance in print,\u201d Mr. Hickson wrote.\n\nAfter the review was published, the debate about sugar and heart disease died down, while low-fat diets gained the endorsement of many health authorities, Dr. Glantz said.\n\n\u201cBy today\u2019s standards, they behaved very badly,\u201d he said.", "id": "d7lx9q7"}, {"comment": "Thanks for copying that article.

The other day I had a bath in the bathtub that I hadn't used for probably like 10yrs? because I couldn't fit into it anymore and I damn near cried when I realized I can now comfortably fit in it once again with extra room.  Healthwise my blood pressure is normal (after 10+yrs of high blood pressure), no more sleep apnea, I breathe easier, I am so much more active and can be on my feet all day, and so on and so forth.  I could rave on forever about how my life has changed....I am just so glad I gave myself one last chance and fought to get to this point, I had given up hope, so to see myself 138 pounds lighter (at my high school weight) is like a dream.

The things you can do with them are amazing. \n\nChop both of them up together, add a bell pepper, some onion and grape tomatoes. Toss it all in the slow cooker with some salt for 4 hours on high and bam - Ratatouille. \n\nOr grab an eggplant, slice it in half, and scoop the inside out (leave enough so it still remains eggplant shaped though!). Blend that with...well whatever you want. I prefer a tomato, garlic, onion and mushrooms. Meanwhile rub the eggplant halves with olive oil, add some salt and pepper and bake them a bit. Add the filling back to the halves after an hour, keep baking. Boom - Sleeping Imam. \n\nOr take some chinese eggplants. Peel them, cut the top off, slice them in half. Heat some  olive oil and then fry them a bit till they're golden. Set aside. Slice up an onion and mince some garlic. Fry that till the onions are golden, add some Mint, Turmeric and salt to that. Put the eggplants back in. Add half a cup of water and cook on medium for 10-15. Here's the tricky part - [Add some Kashk](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kashk&newwindow=1&rlz=1C1ASUM_enRU483RU483&espv=2&biw=1902&bih=932&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi57aqw-YjPAhXEwiYKHbf7BL0Q_AUIBygC) which is an Iranian/Middle Eastern/Kavkaz/Turkish whey cheese. It tastes pretty good by itself. Ok use greek yogurt if you can't find it, but if you can find that Armenian deli meat I bet you have this stuff as well. Mash the eggplant-onion-kashk with a potato masher. Add some crushed walnuts End result? Kashk-o bademjan.  Eat it with celery, like a dip. Or just...you know eat it. \n\nOr if you take an eggplant and roast it on the grill, mash it up with some tahini you've got babaganoush. Also good on celery. Or all by itself. \n\nZucchini can be used to make bread, and more amazingly, brownies. \n\nWhat else can I recommend. Oh yeah.  \n\nTake raw cauliflower, and blend it to a sorta chunky texture. Stir fry it. Cauliflower rice. I add jalapeno slices to mine, or a small can of chipotles in adobo. \n\nTake a head of cauliflower and get the good bits off the stalk. Dump it in a stock pot of boiling water and cook it for as long as you want, as long as that's longer than 6 minutes. Well done really. Strain it, then dry it really well with paper towels. Toss that in your blender with some cream cheese, garlic and onion powder and salt. Blend till it's paste like. Much finer than the riced cauliflower texture. You now have a mashed potato substitute. \n\nThe fine goat cheese chevre is a wonderful thing. Trader Joe's sell bags of little 1 ounce medallions if you take your morning avocado and mash it up with that cheese it's really good. \n\nSpeaking of Trader Joe, grab some of their cold brew coffee concentrate and mix it up with almond milk. It's a good combo. TJs also has some nice soy meat things if you're ever looking for lighter alternatives. Oh and their frozen Palak Paneer is also good. Palak Paneer is just good in general though. \n\nIf you're looking for stuff to drink and you don't mind tart flavors, cold brew hibiscus   tea with a cinnamon stick tossed in is really nice. Hibiscus is said to be a diuretic as well and my personal non medical experience seems to show it's true so you might not want to drink it in large quantities in the woods. \n\nOh yeah if you're looking for something else to do with fish, grab some cheap stuff like tilapia or cod. Turn it to paste in your blender, add an egg, some riced cauliflower, green onions and dijon mustard (the kind with seeds!) and then make patties out of it. Fishburgers! \n\nAnyways, good luck with cooking. It's always fun to slip people zucchini brownies for the first time as well =).

The things you can do with them are amazing. \n\nChop both of them up together, add a bell pepper, some onion and grape tomatoes. Toss it all in the slow cooker with some salt for 4 hours on high and bam - Ratatouille. \n\nOr grab an eggplant, slice it in half, and scoop the inside out (leave enough so it still remains eggplant shaped though!). Blend that with...well whatever you want. I prefer a tomato, garlic, onion and mushrooms. Meanwhile rub the eggplant halves with olive oil, add some salt and pepper and bake them a bit. Add the filling back to the halves after an hour, keep baking. Boom - Sleeping Imam. \n\nOr take some chinese eggplants. Peel them, cut the top off, slice them in half. Heat some  olive oil and then fry them a bit till they're golden. Set aside. Slice up an onion and mince some garlic. Fry that till the onions are golden, add some Mint, Turmeric and salt to that. Put the eggplants back in. Add half a cup of water and cook on medium for 10-15. Here's the tricky part - [Add some Kashk](https://www.google.com/search?q=Kashk&newwindow=1&rlz=1C1ASUM_enRU483RU483&espv=2&biw=1902&bih=932&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi57aqw-YjPAhXEwiYKHbf7BL0Q_AUIBygC) which is an Iranian/Middle Eastern/Kavkaz/Turkish whey cheese. It tastes pretty good by itself. Ok use greek yogurt if you can't find it, but if you can find that Armenian deli meat I bet you have this stuff as well. Mash the eggplant-onion-kashk with a potato masher. Add some crushed walnuts End result? Kashk-o bademjan.  Eat it with celery, like a dip. Or just...you know eat it. \n\nOr if you take an eggplant and roast it on the grill, mash it up with some tahini you've got babaganoush. Also good on celery. Or all by itself. \n\nZucchini can be used to make bread, and more amazingly, brownies. \n\nWhat else can I recommend. Oh yeah.  \n\nTake raw cauliflower, and blend it to a sorta chunky texture. Stir fry it. Cauliflower rice. I add jalapeno slices to mine, or a small can of chipotles in adobo. \n\nTake a head of cauliflower and get the good bits off the stalk. Dump it in a stock pot of boiling water and cook it for as long as you want, as long as that's longer than 6 minutes. Well done really. Strain it, then dry it really well with paper towels. Toss that in your blender with some cream cheese, garlic and onion powder and salt. Blend till it's paste like. Much finer than the riced cauliflower texture. You now have a mashed potato substitute. \n\nThe fine goat cheese chevre is a wonderful thing. Trader Joe's sell bags of little 1 ounce medallions if you take your morning avocado and mash it up with that cheese it's really good. \n\nSpeaking of Trader Joe, grab some of their cold brew coffee concentrate and mix it up with almond milk. It's a good combo. TJs also has some nice soy meat things if you're ever looking for lighter alternatives. Oh and their frozen Palak Paneer is also good. Palak Paneer is just good in general though. \n\nIf you're looking for stuff to drink and you don't mind tart flavors, cold brew hibiscus   tea with a cinnamon stick tossed in is really nice. Hibiscus is said to be a diuretic as well and my personal non medical experience seems to show it's true so you might not want to drink it in large quantities in the woods. \n\nOh yeah if you're looking for something else to do with fish, grab some cheap stuff like tilapia or cod. Turn it to paste in your blender, add an egg, some riced cauliflower, green onions and dijon mustard (the kind with seeds!) and then make patties out of it. Fishburgers! \n\nAnyways, good luck with cooking. It's always fun to slip people zucchini brownies for the first time as well =). ", "id": "d7j6htk"}, {"comment": "All very good ideas here, thanks!

Once the moisture in the mucous membrane is gone, the psyllium has nothing to create the gel it needs to become and it starts to become an impacted mass which has to be moved by bulking fiber, which will mean more psyllium. This is also theorized as why pain killers and certain other medications cause constipation, the liver cannibalizes fluid from the mucous membranes to filter the massive reaction it has to the medication, which dries up the system.  \n  \nAgain, I would classify the science behind this as \"soft\", but the reasoning is sound given our understanding of physiology.\n  \n/u/heyt00ts11 was asking for an ELI5, this might suffice.

My rec for cravings is to make a list of your favorite meals and find alternatives/keto recipes for them that you can nail and tweak if needed. I think I've got one for everything at this point. Good luck, you've got this!!", "id": "d6fkrc1"}, {"comment": "Yeah, girl!! Just remember that your body is kinda throwing a tantrum over the withdrawals for carbs and sugar. Once you fully adjust, it's going to be an amazing and beautiful. The best advice I can give you is to get ahead of the curve on those electrolytes!

And that's exactly *why* I chose keto in the first place.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQuick story: The last time I lost a lot of weight, it was through meticulous calorie counting and very regimented exercise. It worked, but it was also one of the most miserable experiences of my life. Then I had a baby and I got big again. Baby + full time job = no free time, so I knew I needed a weight loss solution that did not inherently require a) food logging, and b) exercise. I assumed this was a total fantasy, until I stumbled across /r/keto. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut there's one REALLY big catch, which you'll see mentioned around here a lot: **lazy keto is not for everyone**, and just because it works for you now does not mean it will work for you later. Because as you get closer to your goal weight, a difference of a few extra hundred calories will have a huge impact on your progress. Also, many people simply can't naturally eat at a deficit. I sort of can, fat is awfully filling (especially in the early stages), and I'm so freakishly busy from day to day that any mindless snacking is kept at an extreme minimum. I skip meals a lot, just because it's easy to do, because I'm not hungry and I have enough energy to keep going through my day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI say, lazy keto is worth a try, especially if you happen to be first starting out. It helps you focus on some of the key essential things, like learning how to shop and read nutrition labels differently, identifying foods and new recipes you like, and figuring out the right balance of water and electrolytes. Once you get those things in order, you can begin to organize and really start logging your meals.

A few notes on alcohol because that's where my interests lie. \n\n  * Cognac is brandy. Brandy is the distilled spirit of any fruit. This includes cognac, armagnac, pisco, applejack, calvados, and many, many other permutations. **Almost all cognac contains added sugars.** There is an unspoken process that most cognac producers do called adding [boise](http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2012/1/22/france-day-6-to-boise-or-not-to-boise.html). Boise is added sugar and oak dust, and it's intended to sweeten the spirit to make it more palatable to the general public. While it's not a *ton* of sugar, it's present, and to represent that cognac, and most brandies, are sugar-free is incorrect. Armagnac almost never has boise added (it's like the rustic, no-frills bourbon cousin to cognac). \n\n  * \"Whisk(e)y\" is the distilled spirit made from grains, and it includes scotch, grain, bourbon, rye, and blends. While it's less likely that sweetener was added (bourbon and single malt, by definition [with some exceptions], can only contain ethanol from grain and water), some popular swill like Fireball is loaded with additives, sweeteners among them. So you can't represent \"whiskey\" as being sugar free. \n\n  * As many have pointed out, *[most casual-class rums have added sugar to make it more palatable to the general public](http://rumproject.com/rumforum//viewtopic.php?t=1683).* This is usually not the case with small-production or single-barrel products, but if you're getting a handle at your local supermarket, assume there's sugar in it.

Brandy is the distilled spirit of any fruit. This includes cognac, armagnac, pisco, applejack, calvados, and many, many other permutations. **Almost all cognac contains added sugars.** There is an unspoken process that most cognac producers do called adding [boise](http://spiritsjournal.klwines.com/klwinescom-spirits-blog/2012/1/22/france-day-6-to-boise-or-not-to-boise.html). Boise is added sugar and oak dust, and it's intended to sweeten the spirit to make it more palatable to the general public. While it's not a *ton* of sugar, it's present, and to represent that cognac, and most brandies, are sugar-free is incorrect. Armagnac almost never has boise added (it's like the rustic, no-frills bourbon cousin to cognac). \n\n  * \"Whisk(e)y\" is the distilled spirit made from grains, and it includes scotch, grain, bourbon, rye, and blends. While it's less likely that sweetener was added (bourbon and single malt, by definition [with some exceptions], can only contain ethanol from grain and water), some popular swill like Fireball is loaded with additives, sweeteners among them. So you can't represent \"whiskey\" as being sugar free. \n\n  * As many have pointed out, *[most casual-class rums have added sugar to make it more palatable to the general public](http://rumproject.com/rumforum//viewtopic.php?t=1683).* This is usually not the case with small-production or single-barrel products, but if you're getting a handle at your local supermarket, assume there's sugar in it.

I would recommend calculating your macros and your Resting Metabolic Rate. Reduce calorie intake by 500\u20141000 calories per day. Also, I would recommend for anyone to think of it as a lifestyle change and a diet. \n\n2) It is harder to build muscle while being on keto diet. If you go to the gym just to lose weight (cardio), then it will fasten your end goal.\n\n3) You can make keto very cheap. Depending on your budget, it can be $2-$3 per meal.

In the beginning it's actually not as hard as you think if you're in ketosis. Often in the beginning I had to **force myself to eat**. Yes, you read that right. Fats and proteins allow you to stay fuller longer, therefore you don't eat as much to begin with. Then, the same fats/proteins stick with you *so much longer* than carbs. Carbs spike your energy, then when you crash, you are hungry again and need to stuff more carbs in to keep that level of sugar up in your system (this is where the Diabeetus comes in BTW). Fats/proteins keep your energy levels the same so you are *not hungry*. Does that make sense?\n\nYou also have to have a plan in place in case you do get really hungry (like a pre-weighed bag of nuts or a HB egg), this way you don't reach for the garbage that only fills you up temporarily. \n\nIf I can do this, so can you. I never thought it would work for me in the beginning and I've lost 40lbs already (have that much more to go too). It wasn't always easy, but I stay busy and ask myself if whatever junk I want to eat is worth it because then I have to start over with Keto. It's usually not worth it, and disappointing on top of that.  Good luck to you.

Does anyone have any information on if and how low carb diets can induce pregnancies? ", "id": "da9ah9n"}, {"comment": "Pregnancies are caused by the fertilization of an egg, so unprotected sex near ovulation time is needed, not just a diet. \ud83d\ude09\n\nBut really though, here's the science of why it worked for me: I have PCOS. (Poly-cystic ovarian syndrome) This means that my reproductive hormones are out of balance. When my body would go to ovulate in the past, the follicle that matures the egg wouldn't fully form, so the half mature egg would sit there and turn into a cyst that then started producing testosterone. Testosterone in women signals the petuitary gland in your brain to tell the reproductive cycle to stop. (Can also make us moody and grow hair on our faces.) No ovulation, no pregnancy. \n\nI also have insulin resistance. Essentially it's type 2 diabetes, but my body still kept my blood sugar in a normal range in its own. It was just producing twice as much insulin as it should have been in order to do so. Increased insulin exacerbates the symptoms of PCOS and causes weight gain, especially around your middle and the organs. Insulin goes up, estrogen and progesterone go down, and women who have PCOS stop ovulating because the cyclical hormone changes aren't happening. \n\nKeto + metformin which I was put on, dropped my body's insulin levels drastically. (In just 3 weeks, I went from fasting insulin of 19 down to 11, with normal being 10 or below. I'm below 10 now I think.) With those insulin levels lowered, I began to lose weight quickly and my estrogen and progesterone levels returned to normal, healthy ranges (according to my blood work). That reversed the issues with PCOS and I started ovulating again. \n\nOnce I knew I was ovulating again, we were able to track when I'd release an egg with leutenizing hormone tests (ovulation prediction kits) and basal body temperature tracking and have sex in the right window in order to have the best chance of getting pregnant. Obviously not everyone gets this scientific, but after 4 years of TTC and doing tons of research, textbook and journal reading, and conversations with my doctors, I know a lot about how my body works.\n\nIn women without PCOS, keto can also help by reducing insulin levels which usually increases progesterone and estrogen.

He pretty much recommended every Weight Watchers-type dieting strategy that was compatible with a low-carb diet.\n\n- He was lawyered up, and he included some important safety disclaimers that are missing from a lot of other guides I see. (Example: That pregnant woman should probably not be on a keto diet.)\n\n- Even though Atkins was writing before scientists knew much about gut microbes, he took gut microbes seriously and encouraged people to eat yogurt, drink apple cider vinegar, etc. I think his advocacy of using probiotics shows he had a good instinct for knowing what would be important.\n\n- Using an Atkins book can be very frugal.

He pretty much recommended every Weight Watchers-type dieting strategy that was compatible with a low-carb diet.\n\n- He was lawyered up, and he included some important safety disclaimers that are missing from a lot of other guides I see. (Example: That pregnant woman should probably not be on a keto diet.)\n\n- Even though Atkins was writing before scientists knew much about gut microbes, he took gut microbes seriously and encouraged people to eat yogurt, drink apple cider vinegar, etc. I think his advocacy of using probiotics shows he had a good instinct for knowing what would be important.\n\n- Using an Atkins book can be very frugal.

From what I read about the diet, ketosis has only to do with the glycogen stored in the liver, not glycogen stored in muscles.

And the brain can get by with less glucose than usual, the balance being covered by two of the three ketones generated (also by the liver).\n\nIndeed, it the latter stages, the muscles reserve the ketones generated for the brain and use fatty acids directly which they can do.\n\nBTW, while muscles can use fatty acids and ketones, many (most?) cancerous tumors cannot (faulty mitochondria) and depend exclusively on glucose (blood sugar).

Maybe if you're performing intense workouts on a regular basis, rather than endurance, the body still replenishes glycogen in the muscles?

The LC group exhibited a similar pattern; muscle glycogen was decreased by 66% immediately post-exercise and 34% at 2 hours post-exercise. There were no significant differences in pre-exercise or post-exercise glycogen concentrations between groups. There was a high degree of variability in muscle glycogen concentrations pre- exercise in both groups. In contrast, the depletion and resynthesis patterns showed a more uniform response, especially the amount of glycogen synthesized during the 2 hour recovery period in LC athletes, which was one-third less variable than HC athletes.\n\nThis is all consistent with the fact that keto-adapted bodies do produce glycogen to replenish the muscles. They conclude:\n\n> Rates of muscle glycogen synthesis in humans are highest when large amounts of carbohydrate are consumed immediately post-exercise, yet the LC athletes had similar rates of glycogen repletion compared to the HC athletes, despite receiving a negligible amount of carbohydrate after exercise (4 vs 43 g) and more fat (31 vs 14 g). When no carbohydrate or energy is provided after prolonged exercise, a small amount of muscle glycogen synthesis occurs presumably due to hepatic gluconeogenesis providing a source of glucose for glycogen. Horses supplemented with fat after exercise showed impaired glycogen synthesis, but 3 weeks of a high- fat diet resulted in similar glycogen repletion as horses fed a high-carbohydrate diet.", "id": "d5zgndc"}], [{"comment": "Starting keto tomorrow.

Also, the traditionally called \u201cartery clogging saturated fats\u201d turn out to have no link to heart disease and are not proven to clog arteries.

It is now understood that atherosclerosis (the hardening of arteries) occurs due to the presence of high sugar which inflames the lining of the arteries!

People who create content are literally the people that drive the site. If the account is NOT just a \"business\" account, but participates like a normal person in the subs, then the downvotes and upvotes should naturally sort the content out, even if it's something to their own site.  Mods should not delete things just because \"Oh it's his own site, BALETED\" without seeing if it is a normal redditor first and foremost.\n\n* Deleting someones post *only for that reason* encourages people to create alt-accounts and an overall lack of genuineness.  This is a massive problem with reddit. Think about it. Why was it okay if another redditor, unrelated to me, posted this guide? But it's \"frowned upon\" if the person who created it themselves do it if they are an actual redditor and following reddiquette rules? It shouldn't be. Cause then someone could just say, well, fuck that and create an alt-account just to try to promote things under wraps.  Why would we shun the content creators?\n\n* Understand that I'm passionate about this topic because I've been a redditor for over 5 years, a moderator of many subs *AND* have my own website, so I see the issues from all angles.

And Happy Birthday!", "id": "d6cawum"}, {"comment": "> front\n\nSorry for the epic essay length! But I hope this helps :) I think it's absolutely key that people with as much weight as we have to lose do it slowly. Not just for the sake of loose skin, but for the amount of time it takes to build a healthy relationship with food and our bodies. At first, you think this is just about losing weight to get a bit healthier or look better, but at least for me - this journey has been way, way more than that. I didn't even realize how close to death I was and how little I was actually living at my previous size until I started feeling how good I feel now and loving myself the way I do now. I think if I had crash-keto'ed I wouldn't necessarily have come to these realizations. I know it's clich\u00e9, but whatever \"diet\" (I hate this word) you choose is a lifestyle, and the time goes by much faster than you think :) \n\nLoose skin has been less of a problem than I was expecting at the outset. This is probably due to the speed of weight loss and weight training, but also I'm sure a little bit of genetics and my age, so take my experience with a grain of salt! You're also young, which is awesome - we have springy skin on our side!\n\nI have found that I have virtually no problems really with my limbs - while I do have a bit of loose skin in my upper arms and upper thighs, it's nothing out of the ordinary and will probably go back to normal as I slowly reach a maintenance weight. While my torso is nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be (I can PM you pics if you're interested!), chances are good I will get surgery on my tummy/breasts once I've reached where I'm comfortable. (TMI WARNING!!) - I've gone from a 44DDD to a 36C. Chances are good I will get even smaller losing another 50lbs, and as a young woman, I'd like to have a nice full chest rather than a smaller, not so full chest. They don't look bad or saggy (AKA - I'm not hesitant/shy to take my top off at the gym), but I'd say they aren't as full in the upper portion as other people my age. My stomach is hard to explain in writing, but if you've ever seen a recently-pregnant stomach, it's kind of like that. At the moment I wear higher-waisted pants so that I don't have rolls where the waistband would cut into looser skin, but I will probably have this flattened in a year or so once I've maintained for awhile.  While I applaud everyone who embraces their loose tummy skin as a symbol of their journey, and perhaps after a few years of maintenance this would maybe go back to \"normal\", to me it's a symbol of how far I let myself get in the first place, and I think having it flattened will be a bit cathartic - but ultimately we'll see once I get to where I want to be! \n\nAs for macros: My starting stats were 1,800 cals, and a strict <20 net grams of carbs, and I tracked my intake almost obsessively on MFP. TBH, I wasn't worried at all about muscle in the very beginning, and I was pretty much sedentary until October when I started weightlifting. Like a lot of other people starting keto, I lost a ton of weight in the first month, and then this leveled out to ~2lbs a week.   \n\nWhenever I went more than a few weeks without losing any weight, I dropped 100 calories from my total. Once you're keto adapted this is actually really easy - no hunger makes total calories irrelevant. That said, pretty much exactly 1 year in (February of this year - weighing ~260lbs) I stopped tracking because I found myself unhealthfully overeating in the evening just to hit my calorie goal for the day.  I wasn't hungry, I was only eating for the sake of hitting my macro goals.  This seemed counterproductive and like I was replacing one eating disorder with another.  \n\nSo until about 3 weeks ago when I started seeing some performance deficits from training, I would eat 2, relatively large meals a day - one around noon to break my fast, and then dinner.  I'd say my total net carbs were actually in the 50s as I stopped restricting most vegetables, and I'm not so strict about asking what is in sauces and things when I'm eating out anymore.  Since I didn't weigh or measure anything, I'm not totally sure how many calories I was eating, but I'd say it was in the 1,500 - 1,650 range.  During this period, I was weight training 4-5x a week, and running or swimming 2-3x a week, and maintaining a loss of 1-2lbs a week.\n\nThe last few weeks are a bit different because I've been doing ~2.5 hours of pretty vigorous exercise every day. Even though I haven't been hungrier, I found I was sleeping way, way more than usual. While I love sleep, this meant that other priorities in my life were suffering, so I decided I needed to get this energy from elsewhere.  I added what is equivalent to a few hundred calories by eating either an avocado or a few eggs in the morning and an evening snack. This has worked to increase my stamina during the day, but I've still been losing 2-3lbs per week the last few weeks.\n\nHope that helps! I look forward to tracking your journey!

Additionally, your arms should be next to your hips and not in a 15 degree forward position. Maybe it's just this picture, but as someone who has a lot of back problems I immediately noticed.\n\nTry to activate your core muscles in your stomach by \"sucking in\" the belly a bit, chest out, chin up and pull your head back a bit.

", "id": "d5vc2xh"}, {"comment": "I haven't read a book, just read the hell out of this forum.  Here is the email I send out to friends and family when they ask me about my diet.  \n\nOne of the big things to remember on the diet is that you can eat a lot of things however if you want to lose weight you have to eat at a calorie deficit.  I can eat bacon, steak, butter or cream cheese but once I hit my calories or my macro-nutrient goals ( grams of protein, fat and carbs I can eat a day) for the day I got to stop myself.  I try to eat about 25g of net carbs, 120g of protein, and 90g of fat per day. I need to get better at hitting my protein goals.  If I don't hit my fat goal that is fine.  \n\nFat is good for you!  Carbs are bad for you, sodium is good, anything low-fat is bad (low fat means carbs).  \n\nStep 1 - Start logging your food into myfitnesspal and track it.  Do this for at least your first 2 months of the diet to get an idea of what you can eat and the amounts.  You can also start weighing your foods with a food scale so you really know how much you are eating.  Weighing your food for a month will really help you get a handle on your portion control.\n\nStep 2 - Do the keto calculator (link below) to figure out your macro nutrient goals (protein, carbs, fat grams).  We eat about 1500 calories a day or less. The first week or two sucks but after that you are good to go.  Also never go over 30g of net carbs a day, really try to stay under 25g.  Hit your protein goal, and you don't have to hit the fat goal, it's just a guide number not to go over.  However I go over fat and don't hit my protein goals all the time but I bet I would lose more weight if I did it right.  http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/\n\nStep 3 - Lose weight fast and quick without having to exercise.  Take pictures monthly front, back, side, and in underwear front back side.  Weigh and measure yourself weekly.  One week the scale might not show anything, but your measurements are decreasing.  Neck, arms, legs, waist, hips, chest. \n\nTip: Net carbs is a calculation you do in your head.  You look at the nutritional info Total Carbs, then you subtract out the Dietary Fiber and the Sugar Alcohols (not the sugar grams).  Sugar Alcohols are ok but some might give you some tummy issues.  My go tos are erythitol for baking, and liquid stevia for other stuff.  Some sugar alcohols are bad like malitol, each sugar alcohol has a glycemic index with how much it raises your blood sugar.  For malitol you would probably count half of the grams into your net carbs calculation.  \n\nTip: going out to eat? google the name of the restaurant +keto   \n\nHere are some good links so you can read up on it.  \n\nKeto Reddit Forum   https://www.reddit.com/r/keto\n\nKeto in a Nutshell - http://goo.gl/NrGK8\n\nKeto FAQ - http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq\n\nKeto Community Knowledgebase - https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/44557r/community_knowledge_base_what_you_wish_you_knew/\n\nKeto Food Pyramid - http://i.imgur.com/pBZKfPR.jpg\n\nGood keto site:  http://ruled.me\n\nKeto for ladies: http://reddit.com/r/xxketo\n\nWhat can I eat?: https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/o6vei/here_it_is_the_unofficial_tell_me_what_to_eat/\n\n\nTake some time to read up on it.  \n\nIt means cutting out all breads, sugars, pasta, rice, fruits  (some berries & avacado are okay though)\n\nYou convert your body from living off of carbs to living off of fat.  I'm consistently losing 1 to 3 lbs a week on it.  \n\nHere's what I eat typically:\nBreakfast - Eggs bacon, cheese omelette with bacon OR hard boiled eggs and avacado.  now I just skip breakfast and eat bigger lunches and dinners.\n\nLunch - sliced turkey, 2 slices of cheese, mustard, sriacha mayo, wrapped in lettuce or cabbage leaves, avacado, and  bacon!\n\nDinner - whatever kids are eating, but I use zuchinni noodles instead of pasta, or lettuce instead of bread, or put sauces over broccoli or cauliflower.  I also measure out my serving and sometimes weigh my food so I can log it into myfitnesspal.  Typically you have some meat and some veggies\n\nSnacks I eat - 1 oz beef jerky (only 1g carbs in it), string cheese, sunflower seeds, blue diamond almonds, pickles", "id": "d5vce38"}, {"comment": "Whoa!

Hell even try and take it step by step.  Cut out sugary stuff, then cut out bread and whatnot.  If that doesn't work, because you haven't developed (not don't have, you just don't know how to use it yet) that self control, then fine jump all in.  But absolutely don't worry about making mistakes and find what works for you rather than just blindly following someone else's experience.  You can use it as a guide, but everyone's experience and needs are going to be different.\n\nAgain, for me, its always been about coming back to the knowledge you gained doing this.  If you know something you eat is bad for you, its not about avoiding it at all cost, its fine to have it every once in a while, but in moderation.  If that doesn't work for you, then cut it out entirely.  But I think the important part of this diet is that eventually you have a good enough base of information to not have to track every single thing you eat, or everything you do.  Eventually you want some freedom, and to make it into a workable lifestyle.  If you go on vacation, or are out with friends, then its not the worst thing in the world if you cheat, because you know that once the day, or vacation is over, you're back to your normal pattern.  I'm kind of rambling here, but that's always been something that is important to me, is not to try to replicate someone elses experience.  I'm of the opinion that for something to work for me, I have to make it easily fit into my current lifestyle and not change everything for the diet.  I know that this isn't how OP is, or how a lot of other people here are, but I just like to give a varying experience to show this diet doesn't have to only work one way."], [46, "I would add, for the complete newbies, **just because it's a vegetable, doesn't mean it's keto-friendly**.

I'm saying strict keto that is a whole-foods based diet can be hard to follow, because of the drastic reduction in food choices and the high prevalence of fat. In order to follow a \"well formulated ketogenic diet\" you need to somewhat limit the protein (this is not a high-protein diet) and jack up the fat, and the only carbs can come from things like vegetables and leafy greens and avocado. The whole point is to maximize the nutrient density in the small amount of carbs that are allowed. That's a strict keto diet, and that can be hard to follow for many people, which is why keto is still contraindicated for people who can't follow it. \n\nThe problem with adding in keto baked goods and processed foods and such is that you're negating some of the benefits of the diet. In order to limit your carbs low enough, that means you have to remove valuable nutrients from the diet and replace it with junk. Now for some people, this can make keto \"easier to follow\", but at the expense of potential nutrient deficiencies and other issues. The other alternative is following a \"keto light\" approach where you either have increased protein or increased carb, and when you increase the carbs and protein you will spend less time in ketosis and not get a lot of the physical benefits of the diet. \n\nLike I said, that stuff is well tolerated, because a keto baked good may not kick you out of ketosis, but you don't want to be eating that stuff daily and try to limit as much as possible. Keto is a diet about maximizing fat oxidation, ketone production and maximizing nutrient density of your food.", "id": "d87e4ah"}, {"comment": "I gave fathead pizza as an example, since OP specifically mentioned avoiding pizza alternatives.

Just because one person may have a problem with self-control due to eating keto substitutes does not make it a mistake for everyone to do it.

I have adblockers on Chrome and Mozilla, but nothing on Explorer, so can't pinpoint the cause.  \nAs someone already mentioned, I thought this will give me recipes based on what's in my fridge, but if I check all the things I get 0 results.  \nMy biggest problem with keto is to find recipes that aren't tailored to USA citizens. In my country we don't have fancy no carb things, special flours and stevia, splenda (I checked all the things in stores, we have Canderel but they have maltodextrin and the other not-so-good stuff and like 3% stevia). Erythritol tastes weird, but at least I know stores that carry it.   \nAnytime I find a keto recipe it's either too much effort or needs things like xantham gum, lowcarb tortilla, lowcarb bread - things stores don't carry here at all. \n\nAlmonds, pork rinds, almond flour, beef, even chicken breast cost horrible ammounts of money compared to their \"food value\" (I mean it costs a lot to only feed me one meal). So I'm stuck with eggs, bacon (also pricy but I use less), some cheaper meat, zucchini, shrooms most of the time and I'm sick of them after a couple months. I love canned tuna, but it's really small and really expensive. Avocado is a luxury.   \n \nOn keto I have to cook all the time and I'm sick of that too. If I wanna take a break from cooking or have a quick bite (like sandwhich used to be), I have plenty of options to buy cheap, filling carby food, but almost nothing that counts as keto or it's really expensive and defeats the purpose. \n \nCrock pot. It would cost 30% of my monthly salary. Can't really afford it, maybe in the future.  \n\nAnd yeah I'm whining, because I liked being on keto, but I get tired of it after a while because of the above reasons."]], [[{"comment": "Hi there,  nice job.

Thank you for your efforts!  \nIt didn't work for me on Chrome and Explorer, only Mozilla. I have adblockers on Chrome and Mozilla, but nothing on Explorer, so can't pinpoint the cause.  \nAs someone already mentioned, I thought this will give me recipes based on what's in my fridge, but if I check all the things I get 0 results.  \nMy biggest problem with keto is to find recipes that aren't tailored to USA citizens. In my country we don't have fancy no carb things, special flours and stevia, splenda (I checked all the things in stores, we have Canderel but they have maltodextrin and the other not-so-good stuff and like 3% stevia). Erythritol tastes weird, but at least I know stores that carry it.   \nAnytime I find a keto recipe it's either too much effort or needs things like xantham gum, lowcarb tortilla, lowcarb bread - things stores don't carry here at all. \n\nAlmonds, pork rinds, almond flour, beef, even chicken breast cost horrible ammounts of money compared to their \"food value\" (I mean it costs a lot to only feed me one meal). So I'm stuck with eggs, bacon (also pricy but I use less), some cheaper meat, zucchini, shrooms most of the time and I'm sick of them after a couple months. I love canned tuna, but it's really small and really expensive. Avocado is a luxury.   \n \nOn keto I have to cook all the time and I'm sick of that too. If I wanna take a break from cooking or have a quick bite (like sandwhich used to be), I have plenty of options to buy cheap, filling carby food, but almost nothing that counts as keto or it's really expensive and defeats the purpose. \n \nCrock pot. It would cost 30% of my monthly salary.

Of course there will be obstacles, but we have to persevere!", "id": "d6d89xx"}, {"comment": "If it weren't clear, I'm not from the US, so I don't know how you figure I could get a crock pot for $50? Converted to my currency, it would be an okay price (~15% of monthly pay though) and I would've already went out and bought it - if that were the case, but unfortunately it's not.  \nGoogle translate says \"spare ribs\" is the meat that has lot of fat and comes from pigs. That one's cheap, I basically only ate that meat with different greens. It gets boring after months. Chicken breast is awesome, but costs twice as much per kilo. Beef is the same. I'm sorry if me living in a shitty little country with shitty salaries makes me unworthy of ketoing, but I just got bored of the same meals after half a year.  \nNow I just remembered, I used to make \"sandwhich\" with two slices of harder cheese. That's closer to easy than chicken breast, because it's cheaper and doesn't require much preparation.  \nYou don't have to talk down to me to get your point across.

I'm still searching, maybe I get lucky.

Also ended up cooking them a bit longer because of the size (~40 minutes oven, probably 7-8 browning in the pan).\n\nI mean, flavor wise it's hard to lose with bacon, ham and cheddar. Chicken breast stayed moist and was pretty flavorful (guessing salt from the bacon brines it a bit while it cooks). Needed more cheese, maybe. I think it could be interesting to experiment with other veggies, maybe some garlic or other spices, etc. \n\nForm factor is pretty cool, too. One of them held together really well upon slicing, the other one kinda fell apart. Making them smaller and rolling them tighter is probably key. Surprisingly, 1) the cheese really didn't melt out the sides, and 2) the inner bacon cooked up a bit. Not crisp, but not raw.

My hypertension is long gone and now have normal BP, no sleep apnea, i breathe easier, clear skin and lots of other health benefits too.  One thing I could not do at my highest was kneel down as it was too much pressure on my knees, now i'm able to do effortlessly and can get up much easier and I do not take it for granted.  It has been a long long road taking things one day at a time, when I started I too wondered what it would be like one day to loose 100+ pounds and wondered what it felt like for others too.  And I am grateful to be here now with still a long way to go but hanging in there.  My one piece of advice is just trust the process, and never give up no matter what!  The additional benefits are that I am now beginning to get some confidence and self esteem for the first time in my life (I've been obese since childhood) so i've struggled with that my entire life.  And finding the longer I'm on this journey (it's the first thing in life i've ever really and truely given my 100%), the more i'm feeling better about myself....i still have a long way to go in that dept but i'm way better than when i started.

I started with total carbs at 20g for a long time just to help keep things in check and with time I found for *me* that I can go upto about 35g total carbs and still be in ketosis (ends up being less than 20g net carbs as i love avocadoes and have one a day) but it's different for everyone, some need less and some can have abit more.  It took me very many months with the learning curve but now i'm in a good place where i seem to know what works for *me* and i'm really happy about that.  My advice is yes count the carbs and just hang in there, with keto when the scale stalls you will still feel clothes get looser (if your still sticking to it) and that helped keep me going through those times.  When I was on calorie restriction (plus carbs) at the very beginning of my journey the stall was a real stall, in *my* case cutting out carbs literally saved my life (bringing me back to good health) and for that reason will stick to keto for life.

It was boring AF, but it was consistent and it got me over the initial hump. We also didn't start making keto versions of baked goods until after we'd stopped craving bread.

It helps that I tend to get migraines, bloating, inflammation, and diarrhea before the mood swing kicks in, so there are always *physical* signs I'm about to melt down.\n\nKeto has been amazing for me. Definitely helps with my state of mind, I don't feel like trash all the time anymore. This seems to be primarily caused by lowering systemic inflammation. The more my head hurts, the weirder I get. My right frontal lobe throbs. There's definitely a strong link between nutrition and neurological health. Hence, why keto is prescribed for those with neurological disorders (epilepsy).\n\nAnyway, all to say.. maybe tracking your mood swings and checking for patterns related to normal bio-environmental stimuli (hormonal cycle, lunar cycle, even the solar cycle, the 5-day-work-week cycle, they all affect a person's state of mind and can be managed). \n\nHope you and your bf meet your goals.. sounds like you're both very supportive.. keep up the good fight, mang. :P :D\n\nedit: just found this study showing keto be *more effective* than medication for treating type 2 bipolar disorder:\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23030231", "id": "czaksng"}, {"comment": "Oh my glob you're awesome!

I have PCOS and I was at my highest weight, just over 300lbs.  I didn't ever see that on the scale myself, but it did register at a doctor's office around that time.  \nI started Keto 8/15/14, after years of failed IVF treatments and nearly 10 years of infertility.  \n\nKeto immediately changed how I looked and felt.  It was and still is unlike anything I've ever tried.  And I feel like I've tried it all.  After 6 months of lazy keto I became pregnant naturally, but suffered an early miscarriage.  It took a hit on my weight loss but after a few weeks of mourning I got back on it.  \n\nWeight loss was rocky after that point but I tried to be as dedicated as possible, because regardless of the scale I just feel so much better on Keto.\nAbout 7 months later I became pregnant again.  But this time it was a cornual ectopic, which proved dangerous and scary.  It was devastating but my husband and I got back into Keto fully after the holidays.  \n\nSo I basically lost 40lbs in a year and maintained it for another year.  I lurked and debated starting Keto for a year before actually diving in and doing it.  If you're in the same position and wondering if you should do it, I am begging you to give it a try.

I have PCOS and I was at my highest weight, just over 300lbs.  I didn't ever see that on the scale myself, but it did register at a doctor's office around that time.  \nI started Keto 8/15/14, after years of failed IVF treatments and nearly 10 years of infertility.  \n\nKeto immediately changed how I looked and felt.  It was and still is unlike anything I've ever tried.  And I feel like I've tried it all.  After 6 months of lazy keto I became pregnant naturally, but suffered an early miscarriage.  It took a hit on my weight loss but after a few weeks of mourning I got back on it.  \n\nWeight loss was rocky after that point but I tried to be as dedicated as possible, because regardless of the scale I just feel so much better on Keto.\nAbout 7 months later I became pregnant again.  But this time it was a cornual ectopic, which proved dangerous and scary.  It was devastating but my husband and I got back into Keto fully after the holidays.  \n\nSo I basically lost 40lbs in a year and maintained it for another year.  I lurked and debated starting Keto for a year before actually diving in and doing it.  If you're in the same position and wondering if you should do it, I am begging you to give it a try.  After seeing how well it has treated me 6 family members have started it and are all in the best health of their lives.  I am so grateful to this sub for all of the anecdotes, advice and information.  \n\nEdit:  I don't post only Keto things, but if you're on Instagram my username is lovecarisa.", "id": "d1uv7fb"}, {"comment": "I found Keto to be perfect for my PCOS and I'm glad you did too.

I ask because, after telling my mother about Keto, she said something along the lines of \"LCHF is exactly what the endo who diagnosed you with PCOS reccomended, but you refused to try it.\" and that was 14 years ago. Sadly, I was 14 and crazy and picky and only wanted to eat potatoes and bread, so I didn't take the advice until much later (clearly, as I had completely forgotten it). However, I was diagnosed by a reproductive endocrinologist because I was so young and my amenorrhea was so bad, and I'm assuming that's probably out of the norm. I have to assume she had more experience with PCOS than a non-women's-health specialist would, but even so, it just baffles me as the solution has clearly been around for at least half my life but it took me years of struggling and  blaming myself, as well as a metric ton of research to figure it out.

She hasn't gone to the doctor for her pregnancy issues (she knows she should) and she assumes it's most likely her weight. \n\nShe has tried keto before and it worked great but she fell off of it after a few months each time. Her husband has made many attempts to eat healthy/ exercise with her but she goes into her bad habits when she is alone. With all her failed attempts over the past 2 years she has lost hope and in result has become lazy/depressed and buries herself in video games (WoW) which is causing her husband to lose hope. \n\nIt kills me inside to see her this way because I love her so much but, it is something she to realize and do herself. When that day comes I'll be there to cheer her on and help in any way I can.

There's no logical way to explain human behavior it seems.\n\n My take is that it's the most familiar way of coping that we tend to fall back into, fo self soothing-dopamine fix, etc... then feeling worthless and shame contributes. Ends up in a viscious cycle..feel bad, eat more junk, realize (on some level) how stupid that is, feel worse due to feeling stupid engaging in self sabotage, feel incapable ,feel as if one doesn't deserve to feel or get any better than that, punishing oneself by reinforcing that one is unable to do the right thing,etc.  Various scenarios which defy logic, but who's saying humans act on logic , right?", "id": "d1vtzby"}, {"comment": "This is very well put.

People who turn to food for emotional support tend to use it for a range of emotion.  So you can eat badly in a celebratory way but also find strange comfort in it when things are bad.  \nIn my case there were times when I had found out my pregnancy was not viable, and I had to wait 4-6 weeks for it to resolve itself.  When the only thing that will help a problem is time, often the only thing that can comfort you in those long hours is food.  At least, if you are an emotional eater.  But knowing that the food you're eating (or even just the quantity of it) is detrimental, it still happens anyway.  And it happens in a sort of odd punishment/comfort cycle where I know that the food has caused the problems, but if I'm hurting, what else is there?\n\nThe answer is that there is so much more.  There is life, the world, and the people you love.  But pain and depression can be such solitary issues, and rather than burden others with it I would eat.  \n\nBut in addition to that, sometimes I found myself eating things I didn't even want just to comfort others.  Upon knowing that I had a failed IVF cycle or a miscarriage, people don't know how to treat you.  So they feed you.  Including my husband, who sees my struggle from the inside.  Loved ones don't know what to say or do, so \"let's go out for ice cream!\" or \"I baked you some cookies!\" or \"Come over and visit, I've ordered a pizza!\".  And in a way I knew that if I refused that food I was refusing the only comfort that they knew how to provide.  I know that's true, because I can't tell you how many times I'd try to refuse things and I'd see the pain rising on their faces.  As if it were a desperate act to prove they loved and supported me.\n\nIt can sound so easy when you say it. \"Just do the right thing\". \"Just don't eat badly\".  \"Just stop eating when you've had enough\".  \"Just eat only organic seeds and water forever, you disgusting jerk\".   But it truly is an addictive behavior that needs to be addressed properly.\n\nAre my food issues gone because I've found a diet that works for me?  Not even a little bit.  But I am learning about myself and what my bad habits used to be, even the ones I didn't even know I was doing.  I have a long road ahead of me and I'll likely need professional assistance at some point.

This is why you need to have a high intake because you will develop hyponatremia (low sodium) due to the kidneys peeing out a large amount of it d/t metabolic differences. I doubt this would have any effect on your blood pressure - other than lowering it over time. The reason peoples BP goes up with sodium is because on a high carb diet, the body already retains lots of water. Adding more salt increases water retention, and adds volume to your blood, which increases your blood pressure. High carb diets actually promote water retention. Just another way western conventional wisdom applies to those who are eating a western conventional diet ", "id": "d91rbzl"}, {"comment": "Too much salt can cause blood to become hypertonic -meaning there is more solute than solvent in a solution (more salt than water in the blood). This causes a rise in blood pressure as the body sources water from other places to attempt to reach homeostasis again (blood should be isotonic), thus increasing blood volume.  At its worst, it can cause crenation of red blood cells from the osmotic pressure changes with water leaving the red blood cells to attempt to reach isotonicity.

Obviously there are numerous other factors that can have an affect here, but diffusion/osmosis and tonicities are pretty easy to demonstrate with blood.

Cells may burst as water diffuses in.\n\nIsotonic: Nirvana.\n\n***\n\nI don't doubt for a second that salt can do this, but my concerns with the anti-salt suggestions are as follows:\n\n- Unless you have an incredibly high sodium intake, most problems will be small. BMI is much more closely correlated with blood pressure http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/03/ajh.hpu164\n\n- Unless you make high salt a regular part of your diet, and unless you already are at a high risk for a cardiac event, isn't it that the effect of salt on blood pressure pretty short lived?

So osmotic flow out of RBC and diffusion into it, but the concentration gradient being different enough to cause the RBC to crenate. I failed to address osmolarity and dehydration, in relation to blood plasma - mostly cuz the ADD kicked in and I got off track. However I do agree with you on your other points. I was just noting that it does have an effect - and people often forget that say, electrolytes = salts as well. That said, I totally agree under normal circumstances, yeah, the body will very quickly come back to its baseline - however I also do not doubt that there are some preexisting conditions that would lend themselves to being more cautious, particularly over time. I, on the other hand, feel like I could eat an entire meal of salt, and my pressure wouldn't change a lick. Bodies are crazy :) ", "id": "d91f3ws"}, {"comment": "But isn't your physiological explanation ignoring the effect that the Keto diet has on water and salt? The low carb intake leads to much lower insulin levels which should cause increased diuresis and salt excretion through the kidneys, right? That is my understanding anyway.

", "id": "d91bijr"}, {"comment": "I still remain skeptical as to the impact. Water retention due to salt intake is acute. If I eat a series of salty meals today, based on existing studies, I can expect to gain 1-3KG of body weight, depending on my current size (fat, muscle). I can spend a day or two avoiding salt, and the water retention will be gone. \n\nThe risk of salt in this instance is for people with serious issues (plaque built up in arteries). By increasing the blood pressure and inflammation due to salt, you are running a serious risk of a cardiac event. \n\nSo if you are at high risk - yeah, avoid salt. \n\n***\n\nWith that said, BMI, even though it's not a really great number for many in terms of measuring health, does positively affect blood pressure more than salt intake:\n\nhttp://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/03/ajh.hpu164\n\n***\n\nAlso - carbohydrates (which we're all avoiding anyway) require about 3g of water to process and store as glycogen. This is concerning as an excess of 300g carbs (~1200 calories) equals one kilogram of water weight. Again, this effect is \"acute\" as you can deplete your glycogen stores through diet in a matter of weeks, but if water retention is a factor in terms of blood pressure, avoiding carbohydrates has a similar effect as avoiding salt. \n\n***\n\nOverall, this is my best guess as a course of action:\n\n- If you are at a high risk of a cardiac event or have cardiovascular disease, cut the salt, cut the carbs. Work on the BMI through long term diet and gentle exercise.\n- If you are at a lower risk, worry about BMI above all. It will have the greatest effect on lowering your blood pressure. \n- Ideally - avoid salt and carbs, control your calories, and seek nutrition through fat and proteins.

But I can kind of tell based on a filmy urine, slight metal taste in my saliva, and after a work out my sweat has a vague metal scent to it as well.  \n\nI'm also very strict about 20g or fewer of carbs a day, which pretty much guarantees ketosis.  \n\n>Whats the rule about alcohol?

You may notice you get drunk a lot faster.  I would just stay away from full calorie beer and tequila.

I feel like you should know this but i wouldnt be surprised if they didnt teach med students properly in nutrition.\n\nInsulin is released (generally) due to an increase in blood sugar levels and signals the cells to take in glucose from the blood.

Insulin release DOES occur only when theres increase in blood glucose; nothing else is a significant stimulus for insulin release in the body. \n\nInsulin however DOES have a considerable effect on fat metabolism, mainly by inhibiting fat breakdown in fat cells, and increases conversion of fatty acids to triglycerides in fat cells. \n[Heres a wikipedia article on physiological effects of insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin#Physiological_effects)\n\n>Increased lipid synthesis \u2013 insulin forces fat cells to take in blood glucose, which is converted into triglycerides; lack of insulin causes the reverse.[54]\n\n>Increased esterification of fatty acids \u2013 forces adipose tissue to make neutral fats (i.e., triglycerides) from fatty acids; lack of insulin causes the reverse.\n\n>Decreased lipolysis \u2013 forces reduction in conversion of fat cell lipid stores into blood fatty acids and glycerol; lack of insulin causes the reverse.\n\nThis essentially means that, if insulin is released then it would decrease the process of fat breakdown which reduces ketogenesis in the liver.

Your body processes carbs very well for high intensity training, fats not so much. I ay water polo and would have a tough time keeping up with my usual performance from time to time on keto.

Been training/eating better since January with no strict diet just a caloric deficit and am down from 225 to 195 with another 15-20 to go. \n\nTo each their own I guess when it comes to losing weight, in the end you have to do what's right for you and I didn't see keto as a sustainable option for my lifestyle so I decided to change my habits which turned out to be pretty difficult at first but once you're in the mindset then it's smooth sailing. Hope this helps anyone out there who's contemplating making a change. My advice is just do it, start now, take baby steps, and don't be too hard on yourself.

I see now that it's more of a lifestyle choice because there are so many foods that contain carbs or sugars and it's easy to fall back into old habits and not watching what you eat.\n\nI was on keto for a while, probably a little over a year, and had really good results. Unfortunately I lapsed and blew up like a blimp and now I want to pick it up again. It's difficult, especially the second go-around, because you sort of know the trail before you walk it.\n\nI'd definitely recommend reading up and seeing if this is something you want to do. There's a lot of information available online and there are plenty of individual success stories to keep you motivated. \n\nOn a positive note, you'll see results within the first couple weeks on the scale and far more after a month or two. Your body changes pretty fast when it starts prioritizing your fat stores for fuel. The first week is the toughest when you're first getting into ketosis, but after that it gets a lot easier. Eventually you can manage your hunger a lot better, know what food is and isn't keto friendly, and have a go-to snack on the ready that can hold you over between meals.\n\nI wish you the very best!

Once you read that (read the FAQ more than once), you'll know pretty much everything you need to know to get started. Under \"Useful Links\" lower in the sidebar, you'll need to use the \"Keto Calculator for Macros.\" Be sure to set it to \"sedentary.\" It will tell you how much protein you must consume (so you don't lose muscle mass), as well as how much fat you're allowed to consume (you don't have to eat all that fat but the more fat you eat, the more satisfied and full you'll feel). Carbs will be under 20, although some people here go up to 25. I believe you should stick to 20 and once you're losing and in ketosis, you can see if having more carbs revs up your appetite. \n\nWe eat less carbs to lessen our appetite (and to feel much better...less foggy, less out of control, less depressed, etc.) but calories are still very important if your goal is to lose weight. \n\nFoods can have zero carbs but sometimes restaurants will add carbs. For instance, chicken has zero carbs, but if it's dipped in batter before fried, then it will have carbs. \n\nI eat eggs, cheese, chicken, chicken broth, beef, fish, occasional bacon, and pork for my proteins. I don't eat nuts because I can't control myself with them and they do have carbs. \n\nFor veggies, I stick to spinach, cauliflower, broccoli and mushrooms.

For me, a carb is like crack - it doesn't make me feel full for very long, and it gives me serious cravings for more carbs.

I had varying levels of success-- mostly related to increased activity. \n\nDifferent with keto. Caveat though: I started the diet upon entering a 'Biggest Loser' contest at work. But I had also been lurking on this sub for some time, reading the info. \n\nWell, the diet worked. I finished second place in both the back-to-back contests we had.

I'm enjoying the benefits of much improved sleep plus the anti inflammatory effect this diet gives me. \n\nCICO is part of this. I keep under my calories.

What works a treat for me is the Atkin's five pound rule: if you gain back more than 5 pounds, you go straight back on the diet. It's kept my weight off for 15 years now; I used to be over 200 pounds and have no intention of ever going back there.  The five pound regain allowance allows for the water weight to return, but little more. I finished keto on April 30th, then regained three pounds, and am still sitting there three months later. \n\n\nIf you do go off on a vacation and regain weight, make sure you try to lose it again as soon as you are back. My goal is to lose it in the same number of days it took to gain it. Did that - just - last month. Gained 3.5 pounds in six days, then lost it again by the sixth day home exactly! The trick is to do it **immediately** after you return; don't leave it for a while, or it will be harder to do. Keto is **such** a useful tool for this! We are so lucky to have it. In the bad old days of low fat dieting I couldn't lose even a pound. \n\n\nI also belong to a small maintenance group. There are six of us, and we report back to each other on the last day of every month. Being accountable to others really works for me, especially with the friendly rivalry! \n \nWhen I reintroduce carbs, I find for me they vary a lot. Eating fruit, I don't gain weight, (and don't lose it either). Eating the occasional potato, and my weight stays the same. But bread? Guaranteed my weight will go up without fail.
