No pun intended.\n\nThe Wiki:\n\n > Tubifex tubifex, also called the sludge worm, or sewage worm, is a species of tubificid segmented worm that inhabits the sediments of lakes and rivers on several continents. Tubifex probably includes several species, but distinguishing between them is difficult because the reproductive organs, commonly used in species identification, are resorbed after mating, and because the external characteristics of the worm vary with changes in salinity. These worms ingest sediments, selectively digest bacteria, and absorb molecules through their body walls.\n\n > The worms can survive with little oxygen by waving hemoglobin-rich tail ends to exploit all available oxygen, and can exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen through their thin skins, in a manner similar to frogs. They can also survive in areas heavily polluted with organic matter that almost no other species can endure. By forming a protective cyst and lowering its metabolic rate, T. tubifex can survive drought and food shortage. Encystment may also function in the dispersal of the worm. They usually inhabit the bottom sediments of lakes, rivers, and occasionally sewer lines and outlets.[1]\n\n > In 2009, a large blobby mass made of colonies of Tubifex was found to be living in the sewers of Raleigh, North Carolina. Revealed by a snake camera inspection of sewer piping under the Cameron Village shopping center, videos of the creature went viral on YouTube in 2009 under the name \"Carolina poop monster\".[2]\n\n[Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcKpx2DxGwY) (NSFW?)", "id": "d6tetpu"}, {"comment": "Sorry!

Almost as if there is some sort of vacuum actuated diaphragm in there to control the sucking in, and blowing out of something inside each chamber. Each chambers nozzle also gets progressively smaller.\n\nThose chambers are connected to what look like the refrigerant driers, and those are connected to the actuators, which is connected to the 6 way pressure block (marked 120, 80, 40, etc.) Those leads go to the 6 actuator fingers, which are connected/actuated by a cam that is connected to the long silver arm on the top. That arm appears to connect to a mechanism that goes down through the center of the device to the \"bottom\" of the unit, where the two gears are. The two gears are connected to a pair of scissoring arms, that look to have a volute spring mounted in the center of them.\n\nSo as the spring expands and contracts as the temperature changes, the silver indicator arm moves across a scale of some sort to show what stage of the process is taking place. As that arm moves, the cam also rotates, which in turn opens or closes the valves on the actuators, which in turn sucks in or blows out, whatever is inside those accumulator chambers with the fan spray nozzles. And as mentioned previously, perhaps the change in nozzle size is directly related to the pressure needed to continue the cooling process for that stage???\n\nThe 6 way tap numbers, I am going to guess, are representing Kelvin, almost like an adjustment pot for trimming each of the 6 stages this contraption goes though. It also appears there is additional adjustment on each of the six actuator arm as well, as the valves are staggered vertically in a rather gentle arc.\n\nNow, unfortunately, I know little of the actual process for super cooling a fluid beyond the basics of high school science, but I think  this is a unit for doing an automated multi-stage gas liquifaction to get down to around -500\u00b0F, if we believe the numbers on the adjustment block are indeed Kelvin."], [12, "[removed]"], [11, "The inside of an old dental column.

This might be good for choosing from six constant-thrust settings, then letting RPM have feedback-control of prop pitch.

That would certainly give \"built-in vernier\" effect, for fine maneuvering at low speed.   So, not 64 settings, just \"six-gear,\" but where each higher gear gives double.\n\nThat also might explain the \"120.\"   At top speed or top RPMs, that particular system can't actually hit 160.

But if it was actually binary, then *really big problem* when the top bit goes high, yet it doesn't add 160 to the sum.\n\nI note that lots of shipboard tends to be traditionally hydraulic or pneumatic, since it has to keep working under military/navy warfare flooded-compartment conditions.

I've actually been involved in the construction of a large turbine, and seen it running afterwards too, so I'm familiar with the equipment.  If it was hydroelectric, it would have to be some strange obsolete system.\n\nAs for ship-board, I get a somewhat warmer feeling, but it's still really strange.  I just can't get over the feeling that you would be way better off to control pitch and RPM in some other way.  For example, if the sum total of the control input boils down to pulling or turning a control shaft, you can do that from a stationary platform instead of trying to build it all into a rotating one.

Because I see a lot of a/c style components on there. Like the stack of dryer canisters, and a couple of reversing valves, plus the manual mixing valves. I would not at all be surprised if this dropped into a vacuum chamber for super cooling gasses to liquid states. Seems the most likely to me.\n\nEdit: So looking at it further, it seems like there are three accumulator chambers with nozzles on the top of them, and vacuum lines running to blocks on the side of each one. Almost as if there is some sort of vacuum actuated diaphragm in there to control the sucking in, and blowing out of something inside each chamber. Each chambers nozzle also gets progressively smaller.\n\nThose chambers are connected to what look like the refrigerant driers, and those are connected to the actuators, which is connected to the 6 way pressure block (marked 120, 80, 40, etc.) Those leads go to the 6 actuator fingers, which are connected/actuated by a cam that is connected to the long silver arm on the top. That arm appears to connect to a mechanism that goes down through the center of the device to the \"bottom\" of the unit, where the two gears are. The two gears are connected to a pair of scissoring arms, that look to have a volute spring mounted in the center of them.\n\nSo as the spring expands and contracts as the temperature changes, the silver indicator arm moves across a scale of some sort to show what stage of the process is taking place. As that arm moves, the cam also rotates, which in turn opens or closes the valves on the actuators, which in turn sucks in or blows out, whatever is inside those accumulator chambers with the fan spray nozzles. And as mentioned previously, perhaps the change in nozzle size is directly related to the pressure needed to continue the cooling process for that stage???\n\nThe 6 way tap numbers, I am going to guess, are representing Kelvin, almost like an adjustment pot for trimming each of the 6 stages this contraption goes though. It also appears there is additional adjustment on each of the six actuator arm as well, as the valves are staggered vertically in a rather gentle arc.\n\nNow, unfortunately, I know little of the actual process for super cooling a fluid beyond the basics of high school science, but I think  this is a unit for doing an automated multi-stage gas liquifaction to get down to around -500\u00b0F, if we believe the numbers on the adjustment block are indeed Kelvin.", "id": "d1iu281"}], [{"comment": "Definitely not an espresso machine. I see no heat source, no wiring. Those brass cylinders would typically be the sort of thing that contains a piston. There are no properly spaced inlets/outlets that I can see for a traditional piston but that still may be the case. Some may also simply be being used to contain pressure, or a filter cartridge.\n\nThat base was machined custom out of a huge piece of aluminum bar stock, as were a number of the other parts. It would be an obscenely expensive item to make. I've only ever seen equipment like that in a laboratory setting. I would bet it's a piece of equipment made for a custom purpose in a lab and it may be worth asking about over at /r/chemistry. Seeing that there is no motor or visible electrical wiring I would bet is it's a pneumatically run vacuum pump or possibly a gas drying system.\n\nEdit, other thoughts: The smaller black painted cylinders look vaguely like the compressors found in air conditioners. If there's electrical wiring leading to them that doesn't show itself in the photos that may well be what they are.

What they found was that the crater was created by the violent impact of a celestial body. The layers of the crater consisted of modern permafrost on top, older damaged layers underneath, and finally, deep below, fragments of the celestial body were discovered. Preliminary analysis showed that it was a huge piece of ice that shattered on impact, which seem to support the theory that a comet caused the cataclysm.[39] In contrast, in 2013, analysis of fragments from the Tunguska site by a joint US-European team was consistent with an iron meteorite\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event", "id": "d8ouyji"}, {"comment": "Doubt it.

In order to maintain an equal and consistent inventory of logs cut down, when clear cutting (cutting down all trees in a large area) loggers will cut down equal portions of a stand to ensure all their log shipments are roughly the same amount. If you dont, your sawmills will be receiving different sizes of trees all year round and cause problems with  equal distribution. This way would allow workers to work in equal sizes.\n\n2: Transportation: Generally, you can't be roaming far out into the forest to gather wood, meaning there has to be a point close to a road to bring the wood, this pattern maximizes area of cutting while minimizing distance traveled to bring logs to a loading truck.\n\n3: Environmental factors: Cutting down trees in large areas can produce effects that damage the quality of other trees, destroy ecosystems, and stop re-seeding of more trees. This pattern might allow areas to maintain uniform reseeding by cutting each triangle shape, alternating between the spaces to allow future clear cutting in the same area.\n\nThis is all speculation though and honestly, it's not really done many places in a pattern like this. Also the lack of area where trees should be shown as cut down is non-existent, logging areas look like [This](http://imgur.com/a/hUjCr)", "id": "d8p944l"}], [{"comment": "I'm more impressed by those straight roads(?), even right through rivers - so I guess these are  usable only in  winter.

Do not use a remote ignition system, and I'd even advise against getting your buddy at the local bomb range to let you blow it up there - unless he or she also has some more recent unexploded gunpowder/fireworks/etc. Fireworks do not have a terribly long shelf life. \n\nThe professional stuff, like what you have there, is good for about a year and a half - maybe three years if you have better storage conditions. The chemicals become less stable over time, and the shells begin to do unexpected things. They'll break sooner - or sometimes later - or they'll burn at the wrong temperature so components that ought to burn up in midair will instead hit you in the face. \n\nThe least consistent show I've ever done used product that was only 22 months old (according to the stickers, anyway); we had a lot of hang fires (shells that lit, but went up later than usual), early and late breaks (exploding at the wrong altitude), five times the usual percentage of duds, and, importantly, one string of finales that went off 27 minutes after we lit them. \n\nIt's certainly possible that whatever company made this shell used much, much more stable formulae and materials than the cheap shells we import from China - but there's no way I'd be willing to bet a limb or a piece of property on it. \n\nRemember also that this shell does not have the lift charge that puts the shell into the air, assuming you fired it from an appropriately sized and secured HDPE mortar.

So if something breaks, you can get into trouble and they can instantly (without recourse) be impounded and crushed.\n\nBefore anyone thinks of doing this full speed, call the EPA and DOT to explain your idea, and find out what the problems will be, not if there will be problems.\n\nAll it takes is 1 guy at the import docks to have a bad day and flag your vehicle or parts for basically whatever they want.

I don't know what that temperature *is*, but they usually aim for above what they're going to be used for. Food from the microwave can get up to about 200\u00b0 F (according to the random websites I just looked that up on), so if this is any decent quality at all, the max should be at least 250-300\u00b0 F, to be on the safe side. That should make it good for anything from the microwave or stove, but usually ovens are set somewhere around 300-450\u00b0 F. \n\nIf they really only intended these to be used for microwaved food, and skimped on making them withstand higher temps, then no, you probably shouldn't use them to take things out of the oven. But it's more common to see things that can withstand up to 500\u00b0 F, so they're probably fine.

To make a proof, they would have inked the type and printed it in a proofing press on thinner paper. A proof would not have indentations, and would have been inked for easy reading in the proofreading department, or as a reference for the press operators.\n\nThis looks like a flong, or stereotype. It is an intermediate step in creating a rotary letterpress printing plate. The page would have been set as a plate of raised lead type (reverse-reading). This flong would be made using pressure and probably some heat to create a mirror image (right-reading). Where the type is raised, you now have an indentation.\n\nThe flong is flexible, and would have been wrapped around the outside of a cylinder and filled with melted lead. You would then peel off the flong, and end up with a curved cylinder of reverse-reading type. This cylinder would be mounted to the letterpress printing press where it is inked and pressed onto paper where the image is mirrored one final time for a right-reading newspaper.\n\nI think it is highly likely that the prepress department made some extra souvenir stereotypes that day because of the significance of the news, but I would think that there aren't very many in existence. There is also a possibility that this was the stereotype that was used to make the plates that day! You would have to find an employee from the prepress department to know for sure.\n\nIncidentally, the stereotype can be used over and over to create many plates, all identical. This is where our current use of the word stereotype comes from.\n\nEdit: it has been noted that I have used flong and stereotype interchangeably. Thanks for the correction, these are I needed two different things. The single flong is used to create multiple stereotypes, in this case, rotary printing plates.\n\nThis correction makes the origin of our current meaning of stereotype even more clear. So today at the water cooler, you can say: \"Well not all ________________ (police, democrats, republicans, whatever) were cast with the same flong. They aren't all stereotypes, you know!\"  Then you can talk about flongs instead of politics:)"], [46, "also, here is the front page from that day:\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/26/science/space/26armstrong-moon-landing-doc.html"], [43, "Those are the type of things that are likely worth more than their monetary value.

It is an intermediate step in creating a rotary letterpress printing plate. The page would have been set as a plate of raised lead type (reverse-reading). This flong would be made using pressure and probably some heat to create a mirror image (right-reading). Where the type is raised, you now have an indentation.\n\nThe flong is flexible, and would have been wrapped around the outside of a cylinder and filled with melted lead.

This cylinder would be mounted to the letterpress printing press where it is inked and pressed onto paper where the image is mirrored one final time for a right-reading newspaper.\n\nI think it is highly likely that the prepress department made some extra souvenir stereotypes that day because of the significance of the news, but I would think that there aren't very many in existence. There is also a possibility that this was the stereotype that was used to make the plates that day! You would have to find an employee from the prepress department to know for sure.\n\nIncidentally, the stereotype can be used over and over to create many plates, all identical. This is where our current use of the word stereotype comes from.\n\nEdit: it has been noted that I have used flong and stereotype interchangeably. Thanks for the correction, these are I needed two different things. The single flong is used to create multiple stereotypes, in this case, rotary printing plates.\n\nThis correction makes the origin of our current meaning of stereotype even more clear.

The OP saying it used to be clear means its seal was compromised at some point and a small amount of moisture entered. Light also causes it to break down. The result is that it ultimately breaks down into basic elements of ammonia, formic acid, oxalic acid, azulmic acid (although azulmic acid isn't a pure compound, it's a by-product of the breakdown, like a chemical debris) and some other nifty compounds. One neat thing is that heating it to a bit under 200 degrees partially reforms the hydrocyanic acid. It also tends to get splodey though.  \n  \nWell here's the problem with all those compounds I named. Despite decomposing, it is not inert. Oxalic acid will fuck up your mucous membranes big time. Eyes, sinuses, throat, mouth, lungs. It will also wreck your kidneys if you ingest any. Ammonia also causes harm to the mucous membranes.

The OP saying it used to be clear means its seal was compromised at some point and a small amount of moisture entered. Light also causes it to break down. The result is that it ultimately breaks down into basic elements of ammonia, formic acid, oxalic acid, azulmic acid (although azulmic acid isn't a pure compound, it's a by-product of the breakdown, like a chemical debris) and some other nifty compounds. One neat thing is that heating it to a bit under 200 degrees partially reforms the hydrocyanic acid. It also tends to get splodey though.  \n  \nWell here's the problem with all those compounds I named. Despite decomposing, it is not inert. Oxalic acid will fuck up your mucous membranes big time. Eyes, sinuses, throat, mouth, lungs. It will also wreck your kidneys if you ingest any. Ammonia also causes harm to the mucous membranes. About the only thing in there that won't hurt you as much is the formic acid due to its low toxicity, however it causes a histamine reaction and skin irritation on topical contact.  \n  \nTL;DR: Yes, it can still hurt you a lot.

(DU dust is also pyrophoric, of course, so there is potential for some incendiary/explosion risk)\n\nIn general with an orbital drop (not suborbital like a nuclear weapon, which have far less KE/GPE), you're better served by adding extra dense, inert mass rather than comparatively light explosives, since the potential energy increase from adding (dense) mass a few hundred kilometres up at LEO is ~30MJ/kg, and by contrast TNT only gives you ~5MJ/kg.

That has potential energy mg*d*(h), or 245 joules. It's falling from rest, and so has no additional kinetic energy to bring to the party. 245 joules is not a lot of energy - it will heat a litre of water by a quarter of a degree celsius, or light a dim lightbulb or bright energy-efficient bulb (25W) for ten seconds (or charge an iPhone 6 by half a per cent, if it was 100% efficient to charge. In reality it'd charge it by about 0.1%)\n\nNow, a small firecracker (the little ones you get in a string) might have ten grams of flash powder in it, which has (on a very rough back of the envelope calculation at 2.2kcal/g) about 90kJ of energy, or 500 times as much energy (you can see from this that gravity is a *very* weak force, as the fuss about[ LIGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO) demonstrates). \n\nHowever, it's also important to remember that space is both quite high up (500km, for the sake of argument) and a realm of very high speeds: orbit at 500km is ~7600m/s (about 7.5x as fast as a bullet from a M16) - which is, assuming a five ton rod, 144GJ (about 1.6 million firecrackers' worth). That energy is in addition to the gravitational potential energy that comes from being 500km high (25MJ), although at this point that's not even a rounding error in comparison to the energy of being at orbital speed. Now, not all of that will make it to the ground, and sadly this is where even back-of-the-envelope guesses run out: hypervelocity aerodynamics is the sort of thing that nation-states don't like their scientists putting too much information in journals about, since it has crucial implications for things like ballistic missile delivery. We can guess that if our penetrator is doing 7600m/s in orbit when it starts, and doing 3000m/s when it hits (thanks /u/xBarneyStinsonx) it's gonna lose ~60% of its' energy to atomospheric heating and the Mach shockwave, so only 40% is going to be delivered as direct effects. Obviously, the Mach shockwave of an object doing ten times the speed of sound is also quite an energetic, and deadly, phenomenon, but that's *really* hard to work out the energetics. Suffice to say it's very bad for anyone in range, although I don't know what the range involved would be. \n\nNow, it's important to note here that energy has strange properties - specifically, that extreme concentrations of energy tend to be spontaneously converted: the extreme kinetic energy of a rod from god would, upon impact, mostly turn into heat energy as a result of the sheer pressure involved. Some of that will then turn into light as a result of the extreme heating of gases and the penetrator as well, although probably not in any weaponsiable wavelength. But the spontaneous heating and associated shockwave as solid matter vaporises, will do lots of damage, even in addition to the ability of five tons at 3km/s to physically batter through just about any obstacle. I mean, most things have trouble with a five ton truck at highway speed, and when we're trying to protect things like nuclear reactors from airliner impacts, we turn to multiple metres of reinforced concrete - and that's against ~350 tons at 600mph. Energy increases with the square of speed, so one-seventh the mass going at ten times the speed, has about 14 times the energy - so you'd be looking at bunkers with walls >20m thick. The US government actually has this, in that NORAD is buried underneath an actual mountain made of granite. \n\nThe lesson to take away from this is that in general, we're bad at thinking of the orders of magnitude involved in different forms of energy. The power to boil a kettle is the same as to run all the (incandescent) lights in eight houses, or lift a car up a metre, or run a sound system for a big bar or small club. Particularly, our experience of kinetic energy is waaaay out of scale with everything else - we can output very high peak power (~2KW) if we work very hard in short bursts, and we routinely drive around in things that burn a hand grenade of energy every hour or so. So, the helpful thing is to put it in context of multiples of something we do understand - which for nuclear weapons designers is tons of TNT, since you usually wind up seeing a few hundred grams of TNT-equivalent blown up at some point when doing high-energy chemistry or physics for militaries - and for the rest of us can be things like \"airliners stopping\" or \"kettles boiled\" or \"sacks of coal dropped\".

I get permission of course. There's some ranches in the country I have access to, but I'm mostly find old tractor parts and odd metal stuff out there... parks are great for getting modern coins, it takes some work sometimes to find parks that are older and determine whether or not they've had lots of top soil put into them vs having dirt that's been left alone for decades.  Usually places will fall into one of two categories- one that might have old stuff and not be detected before but not a lot of people go there so you aren't going to find as much stuff, or places where lots of people go but you're going to get a lot of trash and a lot of modern coins, and you're hoping to find stuff like rings.  \n\nI spent about $600 us on my detector because it is a multipurpose detector that can handle coins and relics but also it has a gold prospecting mode for nuggets etc and works in wet environments. If you're mainly going for coins and relics you can get a really decent machine for about $200-$250 that will find gold jewelry still. If you need one that can go underwater you're looking at a lot more. \n\nI'll be honest the first week or two I was getting a lot of buyers remorse because I was having a hard time figuring out my machine and determining what's a good target and what's a bad.  I thought maybe I should have gotten an entry level one and then upgraded later.  Part of my problem was where I was detecting, I was mostly in my back yard and other family's houses. I kept getting nails and other trash. One way I got out of my funk was I hit a few playgrounds with wood chips under zip lines and swings etc. I got a lot more coins out there and the wood chips are easy to dig in and not make a mess out of someone's grass while I figured out how to pin point targets and learned what's a coin and what a screw or bottlecap or piece of foil sounds like. It also helps watching YouTube videos of the detector model you get and how they use the settings on it. \n\nMost detectors I've looked at you can have an \"all metal\" mode where you can find gold and steel and everything else at the same time.  There is bit of finessing with settings if you want to maximize depth and discrimination, especially with some lawns that the fertilizer has minerals like iron used on it, or it will sound like there's iron everywhere in the ground and it will be harder to pick out targets.

And if you don't know how to clean it, you should never clean it.\n\nBut, if you *do* know what you're doing, there are plenty of times when it is *perfectly* appropriate to clean metal.\n\nAntique silver spoons are one of these cases.\n\nCollectors value patina when it is something that builds up slowly over time, and cannot be easily imitated/accelerated via chemistry.  There is also value placed on \"beautiful\" patina. Brass, Bronze, and ferrous metals (iron/steel) all have this property.\n\nThis is not the case with silver. Silver goes through the standard rainbow of colors based on the thickness of the oxide layer within a year in open air until landing at dull-grey, after this, in most atmospheres, it just turns to a near-black as it bonds with random sulfur molecules floating about. All of the details of the silver get lost.  If you want to restore that appearance, you can do so quickly with a whole host of chemicals, leaving you with something that would look exactly the same as a naturally built patina.\n\nFurthermore, the market for spoon collectors are the type who treasure them. It is customary to polish collectible spoons at least yearly.

That area provided many luxury goods, including rugs, silk, furniture, and silver - not to mention hashish and tobacco. So it's not at all unthinkable that fine silver would find its way to the hands of a wealthy Virginian. Lacking a better method, wealthy people would often supply their elegant homes by sending lists to agents, with instructions to try to find the items (usually abroad) or something similar. Naturally the results depended on the agent, the buyer, the clarity of instructions, and the shipping conditions. Thomas Jefferson was a great one for that. He would request fireplace mantles, for example, and 6 months later, something would arrive...often he complained about the erratic nature of deliveries and that the contents were nothing like what he'd wanted. \n\nAnyway, my guess is that it wasn't dropped in the stream, but was dropped on land and was slowly carried there during storms. Judging by the lack of erosion marks on the spoon and the shape it's retained, I don't think it's been in the river long. I've found glass bottles from the 1950s in slow-moving creeks that have been completely altered in shape from the current, and silver is a much softer material. So, silver could easily have been packed for a picnic and lost, buried for safekeeping during times of conflict (lord knows how much silver is buried in the south or down wells!), nicked by a thief or a servant, carried by a family member if times were hard and the set needed to be sold, etc etc. \n\nThis is a really cool find!

This is governed by the formula `F = m a`, again. However, as this is gravity, the acceleration (on earth) is taken to be `9.81` and given the special letter `g`, so that becomes `F = m g = 9.81 m`\n\nSo we can plug that on in there, and the formula for calculating the force required to decelerate an object moving at velocity `Vi` with mas of `m` over a period of time `t` is: `F = m ( Vi / Td ) + ( g m )`\n\nSo, lets say a person with mass of 80kg falls for 1 second, and is decelerated in 1 second...  \nTheir largest velocity will be governed by the formula `Vi = g Ta = 9.81 m/s` where `Ta` is time of acceleration.\nLets compile this all together, and perhaps tidy it up a bit.\n\n    F = m ( ( g Ta ) / Td ) + (g m)\n    F = ( m g Ta ) / Td + ( g m )\n    * or *\n    F = g m ( 1 + ( Ta / Td ) )\n\nAnd we plug that our numbers in, and get:  \n\n    F = g m ( 1 + ( Ta / Td ) )\n    F = 9.81 * 80 ( 1 + ( 1 / 1 ) )\n    F = 1569.3 N (or 1.6 kN)\n\nSo, what if the deceleration was over 0.5s?  \nlets plug that in\n\n    F = g m ( 1 + ( Ta / Td ) )\n    F = 9.81 * 80 ( 1 + ( 1 / 0.5 ) )\n    F = 2354.4 N (or 2.4 kN)\n\nWhich is a pretty linear relationship. \n\nwhat if its a heavy guy, and perhaps he has some tools. So lets go with 120kg, over 0.5s deceleration after falling 1s.\n\n    F = g m ( 1 + ( Ta / Td ) )\n    F = 9.81 * 120 ( 1 + ( 1 / 0.5 ) ) \n    F = 3531 N (or 3.5 kN)\n\nwhich is over half of the SWL of that point.  \n\n\nedit:  \nIn a real world application, where there isnt a shock absorbing fall arrest, the fall could be somewhere around 2m, and deceleration as low as 0.2m.  \nA 1 second fall from stationary due to gravity, would travel ~5m. a 0.5s fall due to gravity would travel roughly ~2m\n\n\n-----\n\n\njust to add some context.", "id": "d17y6ge"}, {"comment": "Look at the big brain on Brett.\n", "id": "d18ah1m"}, {"comment": "I require more details to fully understand this.

The first worker entered the cistern and as he reached a plank platform six feet below the opening, he was instantly overcome and fell unconscious into the water below. The man on the surface immediately ran to the nearby plant for help. Several workmen responded and two of them entered the cistern to render aid. They met the fate of the first worker.

I have been in combined sewers and drains where gradually, you lose your ability to focus and think. Excessive gases like carbon monoxide interfere with your ability to get oxygen into your body. This gradually impairs you, sneaking up on the unwary. A rest seems like a great idea. Then getting up seems very hard. You have to get up anyway.\n\nOur bodies are not made to sense these gases. We can smell gases with smells*, and we can sense high CO2. But we cannot directly sense low O2 or presence of several dangerous gases. Hydrogen Sulfide, a common decay product of sewage, smells like sulfur. Higher exposure deadens your sense of smell. Higher still kills you. Carbon monoxide impedes oxygen uptake and stays in your blood, keeping blood oxygen low.\n\nIf a confined space (storm drain, access tunnel) has no air blowing through it, you should suspect buildup of dangerous gases. You cannot directly sense most of them, and they can kill everyone who goes with you.\n\nThe body responds to low oxygen with raised heartbeat, rapid pulse, fatigue, confusion, and headache. Extremely low oxygen can drop you in several seconds, or high toxic gases can. Most worrying to humans are toxic effects and oxygen shortage.\n\nFamily hog farms have a tragedy waiting. The hog waste goes into waste lagoons to break down into different waste. These lagoons are repaired periodically... And carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide are both heavier than air. Dad goes in to patch the pond liner and falls over. Not dead yet, but unconscious. Ryan jumps in to save dad, hauls him a few steps towards the ladder, and falls. Now mom, etc...

The Sun Disc was unearthed during the excavations started in 1935 by direct order of Atat\u00fcrk. In fact the symbol belongs to the Hattis from the pre-Hittite period. The Sun Disc is made of bronze, and was commonly used about 4250 years ago in religious ceremonies. The circle which forms the perimeter of the disc represents either the earth or the sun. At the bottom, there are two horn-like protrusions but what they represent is not clear. The protrusions at the top represent fertility, and the procreation of nature. The birds symbolize fertility and the freedom in nature. The sun disc is known to have been made about 300 years prior to the Hittite settlement in Anatolia. Hatti kings were buried in funeral ceremonies typically with 4-5 such symbols of similar design.\"", "id": "d7kvgnu"}, {"comment": "Really?

But it's so heavily built that it has to be there as more than just a fence.  The frame is so strong, that it looks like if a flood pushed debris against one side, it would be rigid enough to transfer the force to the far side, and that cage would become a brace for the tower, to stop it from tipping.  That's just one interpretation, that's not great, but maybe better than nothing?  I'm just trying to make good guesses here, emphasis on guessing.\n\nNormally, you see tall structures braced by having either a wide pad, or by being buried deeply into the ground.  A metal street light pole is bolted on a little square concrete pad, but that is the tip of a 6' tall concrete post/block.  Maybe they couldn't plant this vent tower deep enough, because they didn't want to try to put concrete forms down into the top of a deep shaft, where there would be a fall hazard.  Maybe they also didn't want to pour a big pad to stabilize it, because they thought it could get washed out underneath.  So what they did is built a very strong large bracing frame around the very heavy weight of the concrete, so it can't tip over because it's all of: too big + too heavy + too strong.

Not only does OP's mystery look nothing like any type of enhancement attachment I've come across in that career, it also looks nothing like the clips you linked yourself. \n\nThose clips alone look like [this](http://imgur.com/TzGu2d2) and when exposed within someone's hair look like [this](http://imgur.com/Kguvpqe). \n\nThe above posted is the industry standard, though variations on that design exist. The largest available are 1.25 inch. I have a 1 inch extension clip and a bottle cap in my hand right now. The clip is overall much smaller than the bottle cap. Though my fingers may be more gracefully long than The Donald's, my head is about 3/4 the size of his. A 1-inch clip is barely noticeable behind my ear when set into 1/2 inch buzzed hair...\n\n...because (and this is the most important part) from the cheapest plastic extensions to the most expensive enhancement, attachments always match the hair colour. Clips, hairpins, combs, velcro, even snaps embedded into the scalp all will match the colour of either the enhancement or the overall tone of the natural hair. The Donald is greying around his nape, but because the supposed toupee and the overall majority of his natural hair is blond, a matte blond attachment would be used. No stylist with enough reputation to touch that man would use a chrome clip/pin. If I were faced with that conundrum, I'd run right back to whatever jank-ass beauty supply store sold me a bright chrome thing that should be hidden and get some taupe nail polish. Boom, problem solved, America's great again. \n\nReally the only hair enhancement-related thing I can think up (and I'll toot my horn here... Going from cosmetology to engineering, I can think up a LOT of hair stuff.) is if he were holding his piece on with magnets attracted to embedded plates. I've seen people who have one half of a snap surgically implanted into their scalp so the other half can secure the enhancement. They're hardcore dudes that like to drive convertibles but don't like anyone knowing they've aged like the rest of the humans. Magnets, though... Firstly, there's a million reasons I couldn't recommend that to a client either as a cosmetologist or as the body modification specialist that would have to embed the plates. Secondly, that's a REALLY oversized magnet.\n\nSeriously, I've sat at this post for almost an hour now and have actually had to re-type the whole thing and there is just absolutely nothing hair-related I can think that might be. I'm not sure if all these upvotes are coming from hivemindedness (*because, guys, did you even look at the GIS results?*) or if something's been going on in wigs that I somehow missed.

But I just watched a video of him on facebook with the sound off and captions on and the way he moves his mouth reminds me of someone who is hearing impaired and having trouble hearing himself.

I don't think anyone could argue doses of opiates would be favourable to some benign treatment like accupuncture if it is showing positive results.  Lots of pain is out body tricking itself; for example, you wouldn't prescribe oxycontin for phantom limb pain, you could but that would be insane!\n\nI don't get the short-sighted opinion that if it isn't hard science, there somehow must be no benefit.

I don't mean to suggest that it is not at all related to the brain. It certainly is an effect on the nervous system, and therefore clearly related to a \"neural pathway\" in a broad sense. But, especially after skimming the paper, I think the results relating to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and thus some particular pathway from receptors near the skin to the brain itself, are just window dressing. Everything really cool about the study relates to things happening way in the periphery of the nervous system, at the level of skin and receptors there. The behavioral results demonstrate that pain was lessened. Showing that ACC responds in some way consistent with less pain is not any additional useful information, really, as ACC has been implicated in a huge range of cognitive processes. The Discussion of the paper doesn't even mention ACC, so it doesn't look like they really wanted to play up that aspect of it anyway. To me, it just doesn't look like any novel \"neural pathway\" was discovered, but rather that acupuncture has an unexpected effect on an already well-established pathway. \n\nIn any case, like I said, that's really getting nit-picky about it, and doesn't take anything away from this convincing and unexpected result (at least for me as a skeptic). And if I'm totally off base, I would be interested to hear it, if you hear from any authors of the paper again! :)\n\nEdit: Looking back at it, they very likely meant the molecular pathway by which adenosine has an anti-pain effect, when they said they discovered a new neural pathway. I'm not familiar with the literature to know whether adenosine was known to act in such a way previously, but if not, then this is definitely a novel pathway discovered.

Each Grand Lodge has their own rules about the process to go through to open a lodge and get down to business, but most in the states follow a similar pattern. I'll speak for my lodge but can't definitely say for any other.\n\nI'll show up around 5:45, we'll shoot the breeze, catch up with each other, etc. Then at 6, we eat dinner. My lodge is out in the country so it's not at all formal like many in bigger city areas. For example, at the last stated (scheduled, monthly) meeting we had fried chicken, potato salad, and iced tea. Some more formal lodges expect all members to wear dark suits and officers of the lodge (positions held for a predetermined period of time, with specific roles in the functions of the lodge) are expected to wear tuxedos. Most guys at my lodge wear jeans and a polo. Different strokes. \n\nAt about 6:45 we'll start heading into the lodge room. Everybody grabs an apron (part of our symbolism regarding ancient stone masons), signs the guestbook, and finds a seat in the lodge. At 7, the Worshipful Master (head of the lodge, in my jurisdiction it's a one-year, elected term) will open the lodge with the assistance of the Wardens (Jr./Sr., also elected) and the Tiler (guy who sits at the door with a ceremonial sword to keep out eavesdroppers).\n\nThen we talk shop: running the lodge. It's like keeping a business running except we don't worry about making a profit. We talk philosophy and how it relates to Freemasonry and our lives. \n\nThen, an hour or two later, we close the lodge. There's a specific procedure that goes on to close a lodge, just like opening it. After that, we chit chat and meander on back out to the dining hall for refreshments. Somebody bought an unfathomably large container of Maple Pecan ice cream at least 2 years ago, so that's always available. There's usually coffee, tea, and cookies set out. More small talk, etc. Then I go home and immediately take a shower because my lodge smells like it's literally made of moth balls. \n\nI joined because I love the fellowship and brotherhood I've found that I've never found elsewhere.

Calvi, who died in 1982, was involved in a major financial scandal involving the vatican bank and money laundering for the Mafia and the Propaganda Due group in Rome. While the P2 organization was organized as a lodge, it was 'clandestine' and had no connection to any constituted lodge organization. Freemasons in a regularly constituted lodge are in fact prohibited from attending or participating in a clandestine lodge. The P2 organization was in reality an fascist political group who merely used the trappings of Freemasonry. And the Italian mafia seems like a much more likely culprit for Calvi's killers, as it is kind of their thing.\n\nMoreover, while many conspiracy-minded authors have attempted to suggest that Calvi's murder (he was found hanging under a bridge in London) had some sort of secret masonic overtones, there was nothing to connect it with any masonic symbolism that I am aware of.\n\nMasonry's 'secrets' are certain forms of recognition that they use to recognize each other (passwords and secret handshakes, etc) and certain parts of the initiation ritual, which they keep secret only because it makes the initiation better experience for new candidates if it is not something they are expecting.", "id": "d999ska"}, {"comment": "[Oh, absolutely.

It is\nconstructed of red brick, with a raised concrete and granite foundation, parapet front gable\nroof, and granite trim. The Maine Street fa(fade is three bays wide, fronted by two-story granite\npilasters and columns supporting a wide entablature and a stone pediment. There is dentil\nmolding on both the horizontal and raking cornices of the pediment; the tympanum has a\ncentral round window with Gothic-arched tracery and decorative swags to either side. The\ncolumn capitals are decorated with sheaves of corncob and acanthus leaves. A modern\ncentral entrance door with a Federal-style fanlight is topped by the original wooden broken\nscroll pediment and surround. It is flanked by two ten-over-fifteen arched windows. The\nwindows originally had Federal-style fanlights which were removed sometime before 19805\n,\nand are now solid wood fans. The right window was originally a door. The second story\ncontains three evenly spaced eight-over-twelve double-hung windows.\nOn the Cumberland Street fa(fade, fenestration is similar to the main fa(fade. Six arched\nwindows on the first floor are topped by double hung windows on the second floor. A frieze\nboard and cornice are below the parapet. In the rear of the building, twin chimneys are\ncontained within a stepped parapet gable. A brick one-story addition on the rear of the building\nis used as teller space, and is connected to modern drive-through windows.\nAdditions on the north side of the building were constructed in multiple phases. A onebay,\ntwo-story addition with an entrance door and a fan echoing the main fa(fade was\nconstructed in 1967. A set back, one-story, four-bay addition was added in 1989. The\nnorthern bay is shorter than the other three bays. It originally housed an entrance, but now\ncontains an ATM machine. Wooden fanlight details over the 20-pane fixed windows and the\nexterior ATM machine echo the detailing on the original building. Because of their dates of\nconstruction the 1967 and 1989 additions are not considered to be contributing to the\nsignificance of the building.

The nice thing about keys is that they only depend on the way the data is represented (the *encyption scheme*), which means that it can be prepared in advance (there are also schemes which allows you to securly exchange keys before). This allows you to send information presented in a way that the recipient could easily retrieve it but anyone who intercepts it along the way can't.\n\nTechnically, the way this is done is via an array of techniques collectively known as *trapdoor functions*.

This very definition is information theoretic, and it follows that most measures of how good an encryption (and arguments regarding what encryption schemes are impossible) rely on information theoretic techniques.\n\nThe information theory point of view is actually the most significant one in terms of analyzing and quantifying the differences between encryption and arbitrary encoding.", "id": "d0t9syg"}, {"comment": "Any good lossless encoder will also produce an output that is 'statistically random' by the test channel argument.\n\nPlease read Cover...", "id": "d0tiuxe"}, {"comment": "There is a *huge* difference between being 'statistically random' and being 'indistinguishable from noise'.\n\nThe property we are looking for here is that there exists no algorithm that, given any two possible inputs and a cipher of one of them (chosen at random), could decide which of the possible inputs generated the cipher such that the probability to be right is more than half (this is what we call *information-theoretic security*). A very relevant private case is that with an appropriate key it is impossible to retrieve the data (this is what we call *perfect security).\n\nThis is far from being true for \"any good lossless encoder\".\n\nIn fact, we can't even prove that a much weaker kind of encoder exists. The kind where the adversary might be able to crack the code with unlimited computing power, but not with nothing short of exponential time. But that the information would be retrieved in polynomial time (and why can't we? Right, because a necessary condition for this to even be possible is that P != NP).\n\nYou could try and argue that this debate creeps outside the realm of information theory and into encryption and computation theory. But in practice, information theory is pretty much the only tool we have to prove that encryption schemes with given properties are impossible.

Most other Americans consider it 'wrong' but it's surprisingly common in coastal areas north of New York, especially in older island communities. Basically, it's what Standard American English would probably be more like if it wasn't for certain people deliberately meddling with American English after the Revolution. Some communities thought that was stupid, and never went along with it until the last half century. We consider it proper and superior, and others are free to disagree.\n\nDialecticalism is a character of any widely spoken language, no matter what it is; English is not special in this regard. If you go to France or Spain, you encounter exactly the same thing. Most French do not speak Parisian (the formal French taught in nearly all Western schools, including Canada), and most Spanish do not speak Castillian.\n\nLikewise, most Americans do not speak Standard American English, though it's the recommended form. If SAE was strictly enforced by reddit's engines, almost all of us would be in trouble.\n\nSAE includes 'preferred' usages and spellings, and there are many contexts where it's important to be mindful of them, and some where you should indeed follow them, such as in any formal writing, business writing, U.S. journalism, most schools, and so on. But it's not 'wrong' to follow any of the other conventions, as long as you're consistent about it and communicate clearly. Most reputable sources based in the U.S. will follow SAE conventions. When Wikipedia or Google refer to 'American' spellings, they're referring to SAE standards, which are recommended.\n\nThat said, others are free to judge any of us for our choices. I don't disclaim those who might judge me for my frequent Atlantic spelling; that is their right, and I defend that right even if I may disagree. What I reject is the erroneous notion that it's 'wrong'. It's never wrong in your own life (outside of school, work, etc.) to follow the dialect that's most comfortable for you.\n\nThere is in fact a beauty and diversity in dialects, a richness of culture and history that tells a lot about a person and where they're from. The notion that 400 million people covering a third of a continent could ever be expected to all follow the same standards of language while living full and rich lives is ludicrous, and even oppressive.

They're made for vehicles so they were explicitly designed not to be wasted if a person stepped on it. Still, a normal person shouldn't fuck with it. Even I know what I'm doing and the most I'd fuck with it is to blow it in place with another charge. In Afghanistan there was still some danger with personnel stepping on anti-tank mines because there are some big dudes in the military who might weigh 230 lbs. Add a full body armor vest which is about 40 lbs, a basic combat load of ammo which can weigh about 25 lbs depending on what weapon system you're using and then a rucksack of some sort can put you well in excess of 100 lbs of gear on top of your body weight which could set it off.
