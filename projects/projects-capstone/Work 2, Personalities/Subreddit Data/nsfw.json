Secretly she tracked age, weight, height, skin color, hair color and style, and details about customers too. The results were pretty interesting.\nThe biggest tip earning factor was having a visible handicap that did not slow down the server. People dug deep and tipped more when they saw my friend Julie deliver round after round while wearing a therapeutic boot (after foot surgery) and a cast on he wrist. She had a great story too: she was in a car that was hit by a drunk driver.

Number three was having a big perfect smile, and four was a tie between visible nipples through clothes and visible cleavage. Five was a tie between short skirt/tight sweater.\nI don't remember the rest of the results, but we found it totally fascinating when our friend showed us the results.\nThe biggest surprise of this whole experiment was that we were able to keep the whole thing secret from the boss and the owner.

I can attest with first-hand experience that nips get tips.\nWhen I was a waitress/hostess for a bar and grill years ago we did experiments on what would get higher or lower tips.

She made detailed spreadsheets and designed experiments to see what factors were most effected \"gratuities compensation levels.\"\nOverall visible nips got more tips then not showing headlights. Short skirts got higher tips than longer skirts Larger breasts and hourglass figures did well too. Secretly she tracked age, weight, height, skin color, hair color and style, and details about customers too. The results were pretty interesting.\nThe biggest tip earning factor was having a visible handicap that did not slow down the server. People dug deep and tipped more when they saw my friend Julie deliver round after round while wearing a therapeutic boot (after foot surgery) and a cast on he wrist. She had a great story too: she was in a car that was hit by a drunk driver. The truth was she fell down when one her flip-flops broke while she was running after an ice cream truck.\nNumber two was being visibly pregnant (7-8+ months), number three was getting a larger complex order 100% correct for a large mixed group. Number three was having a big perfect smile, and four was a tie between visible nipples through clothes and visible cleavage. Five was a tie between short skirt/tight sweater.\nI don't remember the rest of the results, but we found it totally fascinating when our friend showed us the results.\nThe biggest surprise of this whole experiment was that we were able to keep the whole thing secret from the boss and the owner. We were scared that they'd use the data about our tips to screw around with our wages.

All humans should be tested and married at the age of 15. The current way people rate each other is often subjective a 5/10 for me maybe a 7/10 for somebody else. This needs to be fixed and we need a definitive rating and a definitive way to rate people. This way all suffering would be prevented. Evil and Degenerate people by nature should be killed. This way a fair and morally superior world would be created. Hitler had 60% of it right. His own views of people wrong. His Ideas deep down were right. Jews should be married off to jews.

It becomes easier to say things that might be (hopefully) out of character. Not only do you not know this person but you won't ever have to see them, they won't ever see you and you'll never have to see just how much your words effect them.   You won't have to feel bad that you made someone a punchline and that it was incredibly painful for that person.   All for the sake of a joke.  There's just no accountability.\n  \n  \nCommenters can become quickly swept up in the jokes and pile-ons and end up so far removed from the subject or person the post is about that a lot of times it doesn't even connect with them that this is a real person who very well might be struggling with those negative comments and everyone saying cruel things about them.  It might be something that person is already self-conscious about and struggling with.  To the commenters, it's just an image they can make a quick joke about, something to make others laugh and join in and escalate.  When in reality they are putting down, passing judgement and hurting a person they don't know anything about.   \n  \nIn the real world, most people build up a sense of social morality, ethics, filter (whatever you want to call it), over a lifetime of interactions with trial and error.   And I think it's fair to say that *most* people tend to behave online as though they would in person (to a certain degree) almost subconsciously.      \n  \nThen there are those commenters who have become so isolated in their day-to-day life, that sites like reddit or other social media platforms, end up filling that void left from lack of social interaction. They end up substituting face-to-face connections with anonymous, online ones.  And it happens in such a way that their thought process ends up becoming skewed, very self-serving and egocentric.  To such a point where the prevalent attitude becomes, 'if it doesn't interest me, it's worthless and pointless.'  I *still* see people on Reddit everyday who cannot grasp that Reddit is not their own personal content aggregator.  They feel if something doesn't interest them specifically, they can't fathom why it would be posted (*'Why is this here?  This isn't funny to me.  This post sucks.  This girl is ugly, why is she here?  This guy needs to just kill himself.  Who is upvoting this crap.  How did you make this list but forget my all time favorite?  Why do people even like this?'*).    They seem to completely fail to realize that their are millions of other commenters out there, with individual views and  opinions who might feel differently.  \n    \n\nThey practically live in a bubble of self-affirmation and a bit out of touch with reality, or at the very least, how their actions and comments might be viewed or impact others.   Reddit becomes a place where they feel at ease contributing and being a member of the community.  Quickly picking up the scathing lingo, acerbic sarcasm and negative attitude that permeates practically every single subreddit.   They get comfortable referencing, quoting and joking.  One upping each other with shock, gore and gross-out humor, realizing there is often a correlation between how nasty and cruel a comment is and how popular it gets.   Sharing stories with common themes:  Navigating through a society full of dolts, jocks and celeb culture bimbos.  STEM majors stuck in cubicle coffins built on incompetence, corruption and corporate greed.   A soul-crushing 9 to 5 spent ducking confrontations with militant femnazis, dullard co-workers who cannot turn on a monitor, religious zealots and Janice, there's always a fucking Janice.  The OP is always the victim or martyr in these exaggerated anecdotes.  The only one who can see the *real* truth of our doomed society.  A fading beacon of light and hope in a world being overcrowded with idiocy (or just a kid who saw Fight Club for the first time and was instantly 'awakened' to the frivolousness of modern society).  They become wrapped up and deluded into thinking their comments and tales are unique and valuable.  That they *need* to be shared because their insights are important, reaffirming the echo chamber in the comments so they can all bemoan these things together.  \n  \n\nIt never even occurs to them that these things don't always need to be said.  Never even crosses the collective hivemind that these crass, joking comments could do *real* harm to someone.  Never once stopping to actually consider that there is a person there.  To them that person might as well not exist.  But they do exist and there is a *real person* whose pictures are now (more often than not unwillingly) the focus of the hivemind's malcontent, getting upvoted and encouraged.  The idea that this person might be reading those very comments feeling completely torn down while everyone laughs and piles on with worse and worse comments.   Often just taking the very first lewd thought that pops into their head and sending it off without so much as an afterthought.   Much in the same way a child will just say whatever they happen to be thinking at the time, without any ability to filter or take social cues.    \n  \nI don't think that makes anyone a bad person.  Just a bit out of touch and disconnected from the reality of the situation, it happens.  But, it is still a very real situation to someone. To them, it isn't just a funny throw-away comment, it's painful and dark.    \n  \nI say all this because sometimes, even just remembering that and having a little perspective on what you're actually saying is enough for most of us to go, 'you know, I don't think I should say that'.  \n\n  \nFor the record, I'm certainly, 100% guilty of this exact behavior in the past as well.  Getting carried away with jokes because of upvotes and encouragement.  So I'm not trying to put anyone down or act like I'm better than anyone, I most definetly am not.  I try my best but I think typing all this out was just as much a reminder to me as well.    \n  \nI'm also not suggesting that we should sugar-coat everything and coddle everyone from reality just to potentially not hurt their feelings (I actually think our society as a whole is *too* sensitive but that's a *whole* different post).  It's just that, at times, in particular when an individual is singled-out as the subject, a little discretion would be beneficial.  We all have our flaws and struggles and self-esteem issues or whatever, what helps me and what I do is to try and keep in mind how it would feel if someone said the same thing about a photo of me and what it would be like if that shoe was on the other foot.  \n", "id": "d3vvamz"}, {"comment": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HbYScltf1c", "id": "d3vyndy"}, {"comment": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PewXdn-UZJE", "id": "d3wgt24"}, {"comment": "That last line made me sad, and you could hear the sudden silence in the audience that they felt sad too.

The battery's charge on the software goes from 2 hours until dead to 24 minutes then 1 minute.  Then back up.  It'll randomly shut off, or turn off then back on by itself.

Most of them have dedicated headphones and microphone combo. Or if you like your G930, try to warranty it. Logitech is pretty good about it.\n\n/r/headphones can answer a lot of your questions if you search through their stuff. \n\nFirst question is, how much is your budget ultimately. I set my budget to be $200, so the Antlion Modmic costed me 50 USD and Sennheiser 598SE 150 USD. \n\nBrands - Check out AKG, Beyerdynamics, Sennheiser, Phillips, and Audio Technica. Those were the ones I was looking at. Their quality-to-price ratio can be checked through reviews but it's best if you can try them out in person. Personally, I also look at their customer service in case I need to work with them if anything goes wrong. \n\nI had run through two Logitech G930 personally, but this was back in 2012 or so. I bought the first one, and warrantied the second one (Logitech has great customer service.) The 7.1 surround sound and wirelessness was great for BF3. My G930 also both gave out, one wouldn't retain charge anymore and keeps losing the connection. The other took too long to turn on, I had to press the power button thousands of times to reconnect. The wirelessness is nice as a convenience but it got frustrating over time.\n\nSo far my Sennheiser 598SE headphone experience has been a lot better. The wide open back soundstage is like the 7.1 Virtual Surround sound, I can't say if one is better than the other but I personally prefer the soundstage over the 7.1 virtual surround sound. Music sounds better but it's down to preference.\n\nOne thing that I did test extensively was the quality of the microphones, I had a bunch of headset and two headphones tested, Antlion modmic and V-Moda Boompro. My friends liked the V-Moda Boompro the most but it is omni-directional so it picks up sound from every direction. Both mics made me sound closer to my real voice compared to most of the headset mics. Straight up though, if you can afford it and have the environment for it, buy a desk mic like a Blue Yeti.

Have no idea what my favorite youtubers use, though.  D:\n\n>Or if you like your G930, try to warranty it. Logitech is pretty good about it.\n\nEhhh... I've already had to warranty like 4 different Logitech Mice before finding one that doesn't malfunction within a year of owning it.  I feel like if I try to warranty the headset it might be a bit much.  :x\n\n>one wouldn't retain charge anymore and keeps losing the connection.\n\nThat is sort of what happens to mine.  The software I have installed with it can't really tell the battery charge anymore, and sometimes (but not all the time) when I plug it in, it'll start turning itself off...then back on....then back off until I unplug it.  At which point it'll either work fine, or turn off and stay off.  That's just one of the several problems I have with it now.  :x  But man, I used to love listening to music and dancing stupidly around my room thanks to the wireless ability.  Or going into the kitchen while still listening to stuff, etc.\n\n>if you can afford it\n\nThat's my biggest problem right now.  Don't currently have a job, so I can only really afford $50-100 for both a microphone and headphones without feeling like I'm throwing money away. (even if the quality is worth it.)

I mean, if it's just a numerical quantity of dicks that wears a pussy out, it wouldn't matter if it was lots of different dicks once or twice, or one dick many times. \n\nDoes this mean a pussy is like a punch card, you only get so many fucks it's done? Does that mean after its used up you get one free anal with proof of pussyfucking? \n\nBy this logic, you should rarely if ever fuck your lady, less you use up her pussy too soon. \n\nYup, I bet you're probably right on track with that.

It happens to everyone though not just people that get fucked by big dicks.  But get fucked by big dicks long enough and I gurentee that you start accelerating the process. \n\nAnd child birth also tears up a vagina.  The sentiment that the human vagina is this magical elastic organ that can regain it's shape no matter what you cram in or out of it is a myth.  ", "id": "d0ehono"}, {"comment": "/r/badwomensanatomy \n\nThe vaginal canal is not connective tissue that droops with age. It along with the uterus is in part a series of muscles, glands, and of course reproductive organs. Yeah you can tear it, like you can tear a muscle, but it doesn't get \"loose\", any more than your mouth does despite all the food you cram into it. \n \n\nAccording to your logic shit will just start falling out your asshole because of all the massive dumps you take throughout your life. Conversely you don't hear of too many gay guys wearing adult diapers after getting fucked in the ass either. If that were the case gay dudes would buy stock in Depends. \n\nHere's a crazy thought. Perhaps women, like men come in different shapes and sizes in their genitals, just as men do.  Some are naturally small, some are larger.  Some women can take all 10 inch dicks, some find a 4 inch dick is perfect. Also it has nothing to do with the hight or size of that woman, just like a tall man can have a short dick and a short dude could have a big dick. Age doesn't change it either, and having a baby doesn't make you loose. Changes can happen sure but after kids a vaginal canal doesn't suddenly become cavernous. \n\nI should know, I have one.

What they want to tell you is that you\u2019re an asshole. There\u2019s no simpler or kinder way of putting it, but that\u2019s what you are. And that\u2019s not meant as an insult. This is constructive criticism. \n\nHere\u2019s what I mean when I say you\u2019re being an asshole. Basically it all stems from the fact that you only think about yourself. You\u2019re so focused on the importance of your own wants that you walk all over those around you like a marauding zombie oblivious to the path of destruction you leave behind you everywhere you go. You may or may not realize it, but you\u2019re prone to treating others with a lack of respect. This means you must not understand how important people are, because if you understood how important they are you wouldn\u2019t treat them the way you do.\n\nWhen you start to do something that you know is going to hurt or inconvenience them stop and ask yourself what your justification is. Whatever your justification is, I can guarantee it\u2019s wrong. Nobody deserves to be yelled at, belittled, intimidated, screwed over, beaten or killed. I mean, look at you. You\u2019re an asshole. You lower the quality of life for most of the people around you. Should you be yelled at, beaten or killed? No. As many vendettas as people could rightfully claim against you, nobody wants that. We want you to grow. We\u2019d rather you learn from your mistakes than us punish you for them. The only reason we would punish you anyway is to teach you a lesson.
