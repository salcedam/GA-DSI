Most of the case is completely full with the PSU, GPU, non modular PSU wires (so many Molex o.O), and the water tubing.\n\nHowever, the temps are pretty good due to the blower style card, and the water cooling. GPU isn't going above 80 while staying not TOO loud (it is a little loud under load), and the CPU stays under 60 without being audible at all. They're the only two things producing noise - the HDD is very quiet compared. I believe the CPU is overclocked to 4.4Ghz (not tried higher yet), and the GPU boosts easily to 1250Mhz so I might try to go higher on that too.\n\nThat said, I would make some changes if I were doing this with a larger budget. I would buy a new PSU rather than reusing my old one. A SilverStone SFX Modular PSU is almost essential in this case since you can remove the cables you don't need, and physically it is much much smaller than a standard PSU.\n\nI would also get a water cooler with some more flexible tubing. The H80i GT has the stiffest tubing I've ever come across, and I think there is a lot of unavoidable strain on the fittings due to this. The original H80i has much better tubing for this.

Think of it this way: if you plug in your phone to a usb port on your computer, it will charge slower than if you plug it into a usb wall adapter and plugged it straight into the wall. That is because there is more power coming from a wall outlet.\n\nIf you use an amplifier with headphones, then the headphones can draw more power from the computer(or whatever is providing the audio), and thus it will result in a better sound coming from your headphones. This depends on how good your headphones are to start with. Most headphones under $200 aren't gonna benefit *much* from using an amplifier. A nicer pair of headphones can often use more power to deliver stronger bass, crisper treble, and overall just a more accurate sound. But the computer normally just puts out a relatively small amount of power. So in order to \"unleash\" its full potential, you buy an amplifier, and plug in your headphones to that, and it supplies the extra power the computer lacks!\n\nHope that made sense.

I noticed they also had a 2 year class of product developing and after seeing what these guys n gals did I really felt I wanted to work with something like that. But I was out of points for any more money for studying so that was out of the question. But I found a company within 30 minutes by car that made real nice chairs, so I designed myself a pretty damn self confident CV where I described my background and passion for all things designed - and also my love for problem solving and working as happily with my hands as digitally.\n\nThey responded with a \"come see us over a cup of coffee\" so a week later I was here on an unpaid month to show what I could do. In that month I devoured tutorials and manuals of Solidworks to learn the program, watched tutorials like a madman of upholstery, welding and woodworking techniques. And then I created two new variations of an existing model here to show my worth. \n\nI passed and got myself a six month trial contract during which time I developed two separate prototypes in four variations that was presented at the furniture fair in Cologne for presumptive buyers. Crazy trial projects oh man, but they seem to like what I did so now I'm hired full time with big plans for the future.\n\nIt all boils down to being a pretty handy person that isn't afraid of failure, can learn new programs quickly and be able to handle massive loads of new (often contradicting) information and be a people person to handle all the myriads of subcontractors.

My monitor is 36\" in length, my speakers are 8\" wide...so in order for me to have perfect spacing when all the parts are on the desk, i needed something that is 68\" in length...the table top is Ringhult, the rest are random pieces i found at the As-Is section, the legs are actually from shelving units, the backboard is for a closet or something...i dont know, just found it.", "id": "d5bywfp"}, {"comment": "That's amazing! I think you've inspired me to just go for it and try something like this myself. I've been looking to create a custom desk for ages. Never thought about getting random pieces.

Thanks for the response, and keep up the beautiful work!", "id": "d5c1889"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d5bqszw"}, {"comment": "Your bookshelf collapsed because you did a bad job of putting it together.  My iKea dresser can barely hold my clothes, they're manufactured with ease of assembly in mind so it's not as sturdy as someone who could drill into the wood and screw in the pieces...i eventually have to do that and i could use my dresser again. My desk is fastened together by woodglue and 4\" screws and believe me, a horse can stand on it and it wouldn't collapse.  I live in a townhouse and i have to construct/cut the pieces outside and bring it up 3 flights of zigzagging stairs to my loft where the PC is, a solid piece of 4'x8' solid wood probably weighs about 100 lbs, making it very difficult for me to bring it in and out if my cuts are a little off...no i dot not a hand drill, i own a power dril, a table saw, a circular saw, a router, a belt sander...you said you weren't taking a \"jab\" at my desk, but you started by saying i use \"iKea disposable bullshit\" lol...I built this desk because i needed a specific dimension, and i barely spent anything on materials so why not.  Little did i know how sturdy it was once i fastened everything in place...if you'd like a pic of me standing on it, jumping on it, pounding my gf on it...i could do that, but believe me, it's rock solid and would barely move an inch. BTW good job on the wood dimensions, the legs indeed are 3/4\" thick, i put two together as the outer leg to match with the dual top.  I took a look at your desk, i must say splendid job, very shiny and looks like quality work.  I don't have the patience for that, plus to get this high gloss finish i don't think i can match what the iKea \"Ringhult\" have.  If you see it in person, this finish is like automotive finish, smooth as glass, i wax my other table, the game of thrones build, and it was shiny and smooth to the touch.

Ive procrastinated getting the ol 98\"er because I haven't seen a method of support I like yet. Can you elaborate on your? ", "id": "da2b330"}, {"comment": "Sure.  \n\nWhen your tabletop is this long and heavy, one of the most important things you need to be cognizant of is that the critical midpoints of whatever support structure you come up with need to be reinforced. [Here](http://www.simplifiedbuilding.com/projects/photos/desks/) are some examples of how others chose to build using those pipes I mentioned in my earlier post; take note that in some of the larger or more complicated structures there are multiple crossbars being utilized to ensure that key areas don't buckle. Galvanized steel is exceptionally strong, but gravity and time are against you, and precautions need to be taken to prevent bowing, or in worst cases, collapse.  \n\nIn addition to having your tabletop sitting on at least 4 legs, supplement that with a vertical crossbar that runs directly up under the table down the middle lengthwise...this will make it very difficult for the table to bow, and by recessing the bar back 12.5\" (98\" IKEA tabletops are 25\" in width; 25/2 = 12.5), your legs will not be obstructed.  \n\nAlso keep in mind that with something this heavy, the legs may want to splay out over time, so use midpoint crossbars to connect the legs together on the short sides to prevent this from happening. Sticking some flanges (feet) with a decent diameter (mine are 4\" and are perfect) on the bottoms of the legs will also increase stabilization.  \n\nDraw all this out beforehand. Make several drafts. Keep a running parts list in a spreadsheet (complete with prices), and use your tape measure A LOT. Make sure that you have a good spot in your house/apartment for such a large piece of furniture, and make sure that whatever 98\"x25\" spot you've picked out is LEVEL. Take some time to consider what desk height is best for you; good ergonomics and sitting posture go a really long way towards making whatever activities you do at your desk enjoyable.  \n\nWith some planning and patience you can have a desk that checks all the boxes functionally speaking, while remaining aesthetically pleasing. Don't forget to sand your IKEA countertop block when you first get it, and consider a protective coating to prevent damage from spills and scratches.

The free app you can download is very intuitive and easy to use, you can section out the lights depending on the room etc. And set up all sorts of themes room for room. You can also hook it up to either amazons Alexa for android users I think or Serie for Apple and control your lights with your voice.

The sound, layout and workflow of synths will inspire you differently and make you write music differently.  It is really hard to write good music so we'll do almost anything to come up with something new or interesting.\n\n**Moog Sub 37** (top) - Has a very retro analog dirty tone.  Great for basses and the looping envelopes are fun. Monosynth so only plays one not at a time\n\n**Dave Smith Pro 2** (mid) - Hybrid synth meaning it's analog except for digital oscillators. Much more complex and can create very different sounds.  Fun for sound design.  My favorite.\n\n**Dave Smith Prophet 08** (bottom) - Polysynth that can play 8 notes at a time.  Can layer two totally different sounds to create lush thick chords.  Sounds a bit weak/thin but that's not bad all the time.

I've looked at the JBL LSR305, your Chanes, and also the Klipsch RP-150M.\nOn the headphone side of that Schiit stack I'm fairly positive I want to get a pair of t50rp's.

The Sys preamp is largely pointless if you're looking at the Mini-X though (it's an integrated platform so no need for a preamp stage).\n\nIf you're placing the speakers on a desk close to a wall (less than 1ft away) and they are rear ported, definitely consider either plugging the port or using EQ to reduce some of the boundary gain on the lower frequencies/bass.\n\nThe 305's aren't bad (they do very well off-axis so placement/toe-in isn't as crucial) but they aren't that compact either compared to the philharmonic option. If you go with the JBL's, remember that you don't need an amp since they are active monitors.\n\n I would avoid the Klipsch gear unless you can demo it nearby. Traditionally they've all been overly bright/treble emphasized to my ears and I wasn't fond of their other models (I haven't heard the 150M though...).\n\nOne other option I'll throw into the mix is the new Elac Debut series (like the B5). Seems to be garnering a bit of attention and the pricing is pretty attractive. I'm thinking about grabbing a B6 just to try out...\n\n.\n\nAs for headphones, the T50RP is certainly modder friendly, but honestly if you don't have the know how and proper measurement tools, I really don't think it's worth while... As for Grado's, I honestly just dislike how they present music (overly bright treble coupled with poor bass response) so if you're tastes are similar to mine, I would definitely avoid these.

It's very easy to get sucked down the audio rabbit hole, especially when you see others with really nice gear.\n\n* Don't buy stuff just because it looks good/interesting (something I see a lot of people doing unfortunately). Sound quality > looks any day. \n\n* Do your research on speaker placement and room acoustics. There are plenty of articles out there and honestly, having the right setup makes a huge difference.\n\n* Finally, if you can, try and demo the stuff you're interested in.

Source: 4 years selling home theater setups. \n\nBy popular request here it is. The tv that is pictured here is the LG OLED which is known for its stunning blacks and about nothing else, but also is priced twice as much. The tv that out performs the one pictured that I was referring to is called the Sony x930D available in a 55 or 65 inch size. If you want the 75 inch version it's called the x940D. When it comes to gaming there is a lot of motion and on many displays we perceive it as motion blur or stuttering. Gaming monitors heave things like gsync to fix it, but on tvs it's a bit different. It isn't as optimized for gaming like gsync, but motion processing differs from tv to tv. The OLED pictured doesn't have a refresh rate rating because they can't test it due to the type of technology it uses, but from comparisons it is about the equivalent to lower than 240 processed, not native. The Sony that I have described can be set to 960hz at its best which helps immensely with all viewing on motion. Another reason is the OLED black levels are so deep that it causes \"crushed blacks\" which means that you lose a lot of detail in dark scenes. So if you are playing darker games like dark souls for instance you will not see a lot of the detail you are paying to see. There are other reasons such as color mapping and image retention etc. If you want to see side by side pictures check this link out.\n\nhttps://www.hightail.com/download/ZWJVa0ZTeFVvQUlkVU1UQw\n\nEdit: got downvoted for not sharing the tv because I thought not many others would want to hear it."]], [[{"comment": "OP.....

The \"condescension and superiority\" bit probably comes from the fact that they constantly moan about how they can't be bothered to save the money they would need to get the stuff that I have/they want, yet they usually waste more than enough money than they would need on stupid stuff(mind you, while making more money than me), like random clothes they find online, or games they think would be cool but don't bother to research even a bit before buying, etc. And yes, my money is indeed 'play money' for the most part at the moment, but it gets used for something that goes a lot longer than most of the stuff many people waste their money on instead of saving it back for a bit to get what they really want. Things that last. I see it like this, better to save and spend/invest the money in something like a nice PC that I can use for a long while(and sell for a good bit of money if need be), than to whine about how I can't be bothered to do it, waste most of it on frivolous, overprices stuff, like eating out, more clothes than I need, multiple pairs of shoes, etc, and then end up getting something less than what I want much farther down the line because I can't afford anything more because I couldn't wait.

You have a great setup, but there's more potential for a better tv. You can dm me if you are interested in finding out what and why. I can show you no problem. Source: 4 years selling home theater setups. \n\nBy popular request here it is. The tv that is pictured here is the LG OLED which is known for its stunning blacks and about nothing else, but also is priced twice as much. The tv that out performs the one pictured that I was referring to is called the Sony x930D available in a 55 or 65 inch size. If you want the 75 inch version it's called the x940D. When it comes to gaming there is a lot of motion and on many displays we perceive it as motion blur or stuttering. Gaming monitors heave things like gsync to fix it, but on tvs it's a bit different. It isn't as optimized for gaming like gsync, but motion processing differs from tv to tv. The OLED pictured doesn't have a refresh rate rating because they can't test it due to the type of technology it uses, but from comparisons it is about the equivalent to lower than 240 processed, not native. The Sony that I have described can be set to 960hz at its best which helps immensely with all viewing on motion. Another reason is the OLED black levels are so deep that it causes \"crushed blacks\" which means that you lose a lot of detail in dark scenes. So if you are playing darker games like dark souls for instance you will not see a lot of the detail you are paying to see. There are other reasons such as color mapping and image retention etc. If you want to see side by side pictures check this link out.\n\nhttps://www.hightail.com/download/ZWJVa0ZTeFVvQUlkVU1UQw\n\nEdit: got downvoted for not sharing the tv because I thought not many others would want to hear it.", "id": "d28o6ki"}, {"comment": "why not share with the rest of us????????", "id": "d28oim0"}, {"comment": "it is a secret\n", "id": "d28wh8b"}, {"comment": "Sorry about that, check my original post for the edit of what tv and why.", "id": "d2at9k3"}, {"comment": "What TV are you talking about?", "id": "d28qndb"}]]], "471ye7": ["Perfect fit in the living room.", "2016-02-22 20:41:09", 2037, "http://imgur.com/YWfXdex", [[202, "Looks cool, but not sure if you like a subwoofer rattling your PC.

Not that floorstanders are bad, but they're not inherently the be-all, end-all.\n\nI mean, if you're talking about $200,000 speaker setups, those *tend* to be floorstanders, but at that point, you're paying for pure ostentatiousness, and huge speakers are more ostentatious.

I've been lurking around this thread for a while now and after recently completing a new PC build, I decided it was time to put some effort into my battlestation as well. I call this... Japanese Steampunk. Maybe not so much steampunk, but I do really like the copper and wood elements.\n\n[EDIT] Yes, I know this isn't steampunk. I'm sorry, I wish I could change the title but I can't. I had steampunk elements in mind when designing the room, hence the title, so I apologize for misleading anyone. Let's just all focus on the Japanese elements, then! :D\n\nFor the computer, I did my best to go with as much white as I could. Many of the parts (especially the peripherals) were chosen with the color and a budget in mind. My original intention was to use one monitor for my PC and the other for console gaming, but the boyfriend ended up hooking his PC up to the second monitor so that we can play Overwatch side-by-side, ha.\n\nThe desk and shelving were custom-made by me with parts from IKEA, a little spraypaint, and a few power tools. \n\nI haven't added up what everything cost me, but I'm going to ballpark around $2500. Not cheap, but pretty good considering that this setup will last me for years. \n\nComputer\n-------------------\nCase\n\t- [NZXT S340 Glossy White Steel ATX Mid Tower Case](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146189)\n\nMotherboard\n\t- [ASUS TUF SABERTOOTH Z170 S](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813132715)\n\nCPU\n\t- [Intel Core i5-6600K 6M Skylake Quad-Core 3.5 GHz](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117561)\n\nRAM\n\t- [Crucial Ballistix Sport LT 32GB (4 x 8GB)](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA4P04BT9550)\n\nCooling\n\t- [Corsair Air Series AF140 140mm, white](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835181048), [ENERMAX ETS-T40F-W 120mm Twister Aluminum 120mm, white](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835214065)\n\nGraphics card\n\t- [ASUS GTX 900 GeForce GTX 970](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121926)\n\nHarddrive\n\t- [Crucial BX200 2.5\" 480GB SATA III Internal Solid State Drive](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820156067)\n\nPower\n\t- [EVGA 220-GS-0850-V1 80 PLUS GOLD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817438034)\n\nWireless\n\t- [TP-LINK Archer T9E AC1900 Dual Band Wireless PCI Express Adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TQEX7AQ/)\n\nPeripherals\n-------------------\nMonitors\n\t- [Vizta V32Lmh1 White 31.5\" 8ms HDMI Widescreen LCD Monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824721009)\n\nKeyboard\n\t- [SADES K10 LED Backlit Wired USB Mechanical Keyboard](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DLNO030/)\n\nMouse\n\t- [GW SADES S7 Flash Wing PC Gaming Mouse](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A6DST4O/)\n\nSpeakers\n\t- [Logitech Multimedia Speakers Z200](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZ9XKDG/)\n\nHeadphones\n\t- [Sony MDRZX110 ZX Series Stereo Headphones](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NJ2M43M/)\n\nHeadphone stand\n\t- [Just Mobile HS-100GD HeadStand, gold](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K5Z8YIA/)\n\nPhone stand\n\t- [elago M2 Stand, gold](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HUY63NM/)\n\nLighting\n\t- [Jansjo Copper work lamp](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20169658/#/70310202), [Fairy LED Copper Wire String Lights](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B015OAKTDI/), [LED lighting strip](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BY7GMEK/)\n\nDesk & Shelves\n-------------------\n[Karlby counter top, walnut](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10301149/)\n\n[Godvin legs, white](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50200271/)\n\n[Capita legs, stainless steel](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60263574/)\n\n[Signum cable management](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30200253/)\n\n[Henriksdal chair, brown-black, Nolhaga gray-beige cover](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S89100143/#/S09100156)\n\n[Ekby Stodis shelf brackets](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30167461/#/80142067)\n\n[Rustoleum Hammered Copper spraypaint](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Oleum-210849-Hammered-Finish-12-Ounce/dp/B000C0175U/)\n"], [20, "A few pieces of copper does not make a steampunk theme.

I've been lurking around this thread for a while now and after recently completing a new PC build, I decided it was time to put some effort into my battlestation as well. I call this... Japanese Steampunk. Maybe not so much steampunk, but I do really like the copper and wood elements.\n\n[EDIT] Yes, I know this isn't steampunk. I'm sorry, I wish I could change the title but I can't. I had steampunk elements in mind when designing the room, hence the title, so I apologize for misleading anyone. Let's just all focus on the Japanese elements, then! :D\n\nFor the computer, I did my best to go with as much white as I could. Many of the parts (especially the peripherals) were chosen with the color and a budget in mind. My original intention was to use one monitor for my PC and the other for console gaming, but the boyfriend ended up hooking his PC up to the second monitor so that we can play Overwatch side-by-side, ha.\n\nThe desk and shelving were custom-made by me with parts from IKEA, a little spraypaint, and a few power tools. \n\nI haven't added up what everything cost me, but I'm going to ballpark around $2500. Not cheap, but pretty good considering that this setup will last me for years. \n\nComputer\n-------------------\nCase\n\t- [NZXT S340 Glossy White Steel ATX Mid Tower Case](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811146189)\n\nMotherboard\n\t- [ASUS TUF SABERTOOTH Z170 S](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813132715)\n\nCPU\n\t- [Intel Core i5-6600K 6M Skylake Quad-Core 3.5 GHz](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117561)\n\nRAM\n\t- [Crucial Ballistix Sport LT 32GB (4 x 8GB)](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA4P04BT9550)\n\nCooling\n\t- [Corsair Air Series AF140 140mm, white](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835181048), [ENERMAX ETS-T40F-W 120mm Twister Aluminum 120mm, white](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835214065)\n\nGraphics card\n\t- [ASUS GTX 900 GeForce GTX 970](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814121926)\n\nHarddrive\n\t- [Crucial BX200 2.5\" 480GB SATA III Internal Solid State Drive](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820156067)\n\nPower\n\t- [EVGA 220-GS-0850-V1 80 PLUS GOLD](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817438034)\n\nWireless\n\t- [TP-LINK Archer T9E AC1900 Dual Band Wireless PCI Express Adapter](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TQEX7AQ/)\n\nPeripherals\n-------------------\nMonitors\n\t- [Vizta V32Lmh1 White 31.5\" 8ms HDMI Widescreen LCD Monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824721009)\n\nKeyboard\n\t- [SADES K10 LED Backlit Wired USB Mechanical Keyboard](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DLNO030/)\n\nMouse\n\t- [GW SADES S7 Flash Wing PC Gaming Mouse](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A6DST4O/)\n\nSpeakers\n\t- [Logitech Multimedia Speakers Z200](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZ9XKDG/)\n\nHeadphones\n\t- [Sony MDRZX110 ZX Series Stereo Headphones](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NJ2M43M/)\n\nHeadphone stand\n\t- [Just Mobile HS-100GD HeadStand, gold](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K5Z8YIA/)\n\nPhone stand\n\t- [elago M2 Stand, gold](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HUY63NM/)\n\nLighting\n\t- [Jansjo Copper work lamp](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20169658/#/70310202), [Fairy LED Copper Wire String Lights](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B015OAKTDI/), [LED lighting strip](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BY7GMEK/)\n\nDesk & Shelves\n-------------------\n[Karlby counter top, walnut](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/10301149/)\n\n[Godvin legs, white](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/50200271/)\n\n[Capita legs, stainless steel](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60263574/)\n\n[Signum cable management](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30200253/)\n\n[Henriksdal chair, brown-black, Nolhaga gray-beige cover](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S89100143/#/S09100156)\n\n[Ekby Stodis shelf brackets](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/30167461/#/80142067)\n\n[Rustoleum Hammered Copper spraypaint](https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Oleum-210849-Hammered-Finish-12-Ounce/dp/B000C0175U/)\n", "id": "d5qbhu9"}, {"comment": "Thank you!

For getting ideas down, pen and paper is still my thing.\n\nMy work flow for art starts with ideation on paper, research and look for inspiration on mobile (iPhone, iPad), sketch out the rough layout on paper, then my PC or my Companion 2 for final work. That's why I still have an old scanner under my desk.\n\nI were a Mac user for the last 10 years, and just switched to PC after the Companion 2.

Wish I could just vesa mount them, but none of the monitors have the holes.\n\nAny suggestions on this?\n\nEdit: I guess I could just put 8 legs on the monitor stand, that would make support much easier.\n", "id": "d9yyx6v"}, {"comment": "/u/FSMCA\n/u/gearfuze\n\nI actually have the same corner desk and I built a monitor stand for it as well. \n\n[complete setup](http://imgur.com/C3Cn8MI.jpg)\n\n[the stand painted](http://imgur.com/HmTBrOx.jpg)\n\n[I bought this jigsaw for the project and already had a power drill.

I never seem to get things like that just right unless I use a jig, i.e. uneven table legs, bird house that has gaps.\n\nI like all the space at the back, not being limited by the 10-11\" depth of the shelves I am thinking of.

To draw the curve I took a string and clamped it to one corner and went from edge to edge.  It might not be the same shape, but it's pretty close and I like it.\n\nThe stand isn't anything pretty.  I just counter sunk the screws in from the top for the legs.  I didn't take a router to the edges or anything and hardly sanded it, but it's extremely functional.  There's much more room for storage above and below the desk.  \n\nI also thought about rounding the rear of the stand but decided to go with the square back for more room.\n\nAnd lastly, yes I thought about removing some of the legs underneath.  For the most part I don't shift from the main corner so it's not that big of a deal.  I only have the short tables on either side of the corner piece.

Lumbar support for my body was so-so.\n\nSteelcase Gesture\n----\n\nWas actually nicer than the Leap, especially in terms of active lumbar support. Comes with a headrest option, and is definitely what I would consider more executive style over task. Would exclusively get this in the leather options because the fabric options for this chair suck absolute ass. This is my runner up chair though.\n\nHaworth Zody\n----\n\nThe leather version of this one that I tried was actually the most comfortable of all of the chairs I tried. However, there were some real problems here. One, I didn't want leather because I do work in my chair up to 8 hours a day, and I don't want to sweat like no one's business. And two, the build quality wasn't all that fantastic, despite the outward appearance looking like it was sturdy. Also, after research, Haworth's warranty and service is literally non-existent.\n\nHaworth Fern\n----\nActually unreleased chair that I was allowed to try before release at their showroom. It sucked ass. Do not buy that piece of shit unless you are someone who is design over function in the purest form. Looks like. No support to your back.\n\nHerman Miller Aeron\n----\n\nThis chair forces you to have good posture, and for my back, did offer a lot of support. However, the biggest problem is the seat rim is a hard plastic. And I very frequently sit indian-leg style in my chair, sometimes half-naked (TMI, but this is my home office, so yolo). That is incredibly uncomfortable. The build quality of these though are like a truck. Incredibly sturdy chairs with a retardedly large amount of adjustments.\n\nHerman Miller Embody\n----\n\nThis chair also forces you to have good posture. It also has a mesh fabric, instead of a fart-absorbing cushion like most other chairs. The back SEEMS like it is too narrow, but even for me who has a swimmer's body swimming competitively for a long time, it actually fits me perfectly no matter how I lean in it. The lumbar support isn't for everyone though, and benefits someone whose arch is a bit closer to their butt than others who don't have that. What sold me on it is that it fit my back perfectly, and since I'm constantly moving side to side to pick up papers on my side of my L-desk, it moves with your back while still supporting. Also, the amount of knobs on it is really small, and all of it is intuitive and not confusing. That, and Herman Miller's warranty and support is really damn good (getting a service done for my 1961 Herman Miller Eames lounge chair at the moment, and they are a pleasure to work with). Forgot to mention that you basically have to go with the Balance fabric upgrade on this chair, as the default mesh/fabric is considerably thinner, enough to where you can feel the mechanisms in the chair back. The Balance fabric alleviates this.\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I hope this helps you and others.", "id": "d3mj3j0"}, {"comment": "wow man, thank you so much for all the effort you put into that post.

Oh, and randomly enabling the secure connection feature in settings without my knowledge, reducing my unit to an absolute crawl in transfer speeds until I found out the reason it was happening.\n\nYou could go with a build-your-own-NAS system, but if you want something in a small footprint (size and energy), a good consumer NAS is a better investment than building your own.
