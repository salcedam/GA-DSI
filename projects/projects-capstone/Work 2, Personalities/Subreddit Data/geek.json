You can try two fun tricks with the show:\n\n1. Cut out the laugh track. Suddenly, it seems pretty weak. Because any moderately funny material is few and far between. It also uses referential humour a lot, coasting on positive associations with movies and such. e.g. a reference to Indiana Jones will be made, which isn't funny in itself, but the addition of a laugh cue somehow makes it \"funny\" because the viewer is reminded of past amusement from the movie being referenced.\n\n2.

I'm not sure I get it 100%.", "id": "darnt79"}, {"comment": "(I've posted this somewhere else when someone asked if virtual particles are \"real\". Should apply here too pretty well.)\n\nThe main challenge in understanding QM is the fact that we are all intelligent animals whose brains developed in what is for all practical purposes a classic newtonian universe. When you were one year old, crawling on the floor at your parents' house, your brain was learning to operate within the realm of classic physics.\nIn such a universe, things are very clear-cut. An object must be either here, or there. Something must be either in this state, or the other. Particles behave like billiard balls, and waves behave like, well, waves. Things either exist, or they do not. Space and time have perfect accuracy, there's no \"smearing\" of coordinates either in space or in time.\n\nThe problem is, that is not at all the case at microscopic levels. You've learned what a marble is as a kid, and you think of electrons as little marbles racing around the nucleus - but that's utterly wrong. You've watched water waves on a pond and you think that's how a beam of light behaves, but that's ridiculously simplistic.\nThe fundamental reality at the quantum level is the awkwardly named wave function (awkward because there's no wave proper there). That's what electrons, and photons, and neutrons, etc, are. It's a function that describes a probability amplitude as a complex number. That's it. They're not little marbles - although sometimes they kind of behave like that. They're not little waves - although they kinda-sorta look like that. They are bundles of probability amplitudes smeared out over space and time intervals. This is not a metaphor. This is stark reality.\n\nThe familiar classic universe with crawling floors and marbles and water waves is just an epiphenomenon. It's a collateral that emerges on top of the quantum world if you zoom out a trillion-fold and ignore all the little details.\n\nThe \"smearing out\" of space, time, momentum and energy parameters at the quantum level simply means these are not the truly fundamental things you think they are on that level. Take energy and time; in a quantum system, you could measure energy with infinite precision, but then you can't say anything about the time intervals. Or you could measure time very precisely, but then you don't know anything about energy. That's not a limitation of your equipment. It simply means neither energy nor time are the precious snowflakes you thought they are - but their combination is.\n\nA particle that does not exist has exactly zero energy and exists for exactly zero seconds. But wait, this is the quantum world. That means a deviation from zero energy is permissible, as long as it does not take place longer than a correspondingly short interval. The higher the energy deviation, the shorter the duration of the blip. That means, in completely empty space, you will be able to measure that particles seem to appear out of nowhere, exist a very short time (the more massive the particle, the shorter the time), then vanish.\n\nBut do those particles actually exist? In QM, that's meaningless. Remember, there's no such thing as a particle? Only bundles of probability density? Remember that? And those bundles obey the basic relations about energy/time and momentum/location. As long as you're talking about fluctuations the size of an electron, then yes, pure vacuum would seem to produce electrons continuously, but they only blip in and out of measurement for a very short time.\n\nBut are they \"real\"? If you can measure it, it's real. Full stop. But classic categories such as \"it exists\" or \"it does not exist\" get blurred at the quantum level. Anything could potentially, and does actually, exist - provided it does not violate basic QM relations.\n\n---\n\nSo that \"quantum fog\" exists in a vacuum all the time. Usually it's completely chaotic. But magnetars have such strong magnetic fields, they impose a structure over those short-lived virtual particles. And then when light passes through, it interacts with that structure and gets polarized.\n\nSo do those virtual particles exist? Well, they changed the light, didn't they? But realistically - \"exists\", \"does not exist\", that's newtonian bullshit. At the quantum level, which is the basis of reality as far as we can tell nowadays, it's all about probability functions.\n\n---\n\nIf you feel compelled to visualize this stuff, think of quantum particles as little \"clouds\" of probability. More dense in the middle regions, getting thinner and thinner towards the periphery - but basically it keeps going on an on, it's just a stupendously small value far from the thickness.

But to a layman they seem like magicians.\n\n\"I know 10 programming languages\" as a software developer means \"I can brush up on the syntax of 8 other programming languages, but I really *know* 2\". I know C# very well, and Java pretty darn well. I can also write in Javascript, Python, Ruby, Perl, C++, VB, PHP, and SQL if you want to count that as a programming language. Separating the 'scripting languages' from the 'programming languages' nowadays is a little silly I think. What you can do in scripting languages, you can generally do in the 'programming languages', it's just overkill. Knowing how to properly write programs in either is the big thing here... but I don't want to get too far into that.\n\nTo put it in perspective, the other 'primary' languages (that get people hired specifically to code for) I can think of off the top of my head are C, R, and Matlab. (Not counting the older languages like COBOL) There are others but jobs are rare. (And I'm sure some pedant will come along and add a couple I didn't think of)\n\nSo \"knowing 10 programming languages\", as in *really* knowing them, is very rare, and almost a pants-on-head retarded waste of time unless you are an absolute savant. Knowing one very well, and others as long as you brush up on syntax, is normal. My job is primarily C# (so I'm good at it) and Javascript (which I don't feel as proficient at, but I'm not bad I guess).

Sure, once in a great while, but we don't want to sacrifice our lives and our families by making this a regular (and expected) part of our job.

So WPVI in Philadelphia and KSTP in St. Paul have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with each other, even though they're both ABC affiliates. They do their own local programming, they buy their own syndicated shows, they dictate their own schedules and sell their own ad time.\n\nAt the national level we have networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, The CW, Ion, Univision, Telemundo, etc). Individual stations become affiliates of these networks and they run some of their programming on their channels. Generally the affiliation agreement dictates they must run all the prime time programming (so your *2 Broke Girls*, *Scorpion*, *Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.*, *Once Upon a Time*, *The Blacklist*, *iZombie*, *America's Got Talent*, etc), but other outside the affiliation contract they have no control over the station beyond that (unless they also own the station, which is the case in some TV markets).\n\nPBS works in much the same way, except they've got some really unique aspects in that they seem to be much more lenient about when some programs can air (e.g. \"As long as you run *Washington Week* on Friday night you can rerun it whenever you want during the weekend\"), but they also act as a sort of exchange for local programming. So for example, [*Nova*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_\\(TV_series\\)) and [*Frontline*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontline_\\(U.S._TV_series\\)) are carried nationwide on PBS, but they're not produced by PBS. They're produced by WGBH in Boston, and PBS distributes it to all the other affiliates. Similar story with [*PBS NewsHour*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_NewsHour) which is produced by WETA in Washington DC, and [*Austin City Limits*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_City_Limits) by KRLU in Austin, but carried nationwide through PBS. This agreement presumably is also why I can get local programming from across the country via [PBS Video](http://video.pbs.org/).\n\nSo PBS (and the individual networks) don't necessarily need the same amount of money to plow into running 24/7 national broadcasts because some of that is handled by the local affiliates. PBS is also only *partially* funded by the government. It gets a lot of money through corporate sponsorship, donations from various funds, and [by contributions from individual viewers like you.

Early symptoms of steroid abuse are, serious cystic acne, significant, sudden increases in body weight, headaches, dizziness, severe leg and abdominal cramping, and premature hair loss.1\n\nThe entire body is affected by steroid use. Health risks involving the cardiovascular system include, cholesterol modifications, heart disease, anaphylactic shock, high blood pressure, septic shock, and even death.\n\nEffects to the reproductive system include, genital atrophy, genital swelling, sexual dysfunction, sterility, impotence, prostate enlargement, fetal damage, and menstrual irregularities. The liver and kidneys are under constant attack by steroids.\n\nEffects to the liver include, cancer, jaundice, tumors, and Pelosis hepatitis. Damage to the kidneys includes, kidney stones, kidney disease, and kidney malfunctions. Taking steroids can also affect your skin. Acne, oily skin, rashes, purple or red spots on the body, hives, increased body hair, baldness, and increased facial hair in women.\n\nOther side effects include edema bone pain, nausea, chills, diarrhea, insomnia, deepening of the voice, and changes in bowel and urinary habits.\n\nSteroids can also affect the user psychologically.

Do you have the right to forcibly take somebody's content without paying the price they ask?\n\nIMO, torrenting is *somewhat* defensible because, once a copy is made, copying it again and again doesn't continue to drain resources from the producer. There is certainly a virtual loss in that some people would pay if they had to, but you can always argue that the increased exposure might compensate for that by getting more paying customers in the end. And because torrenting itself has legit uses, I don't think banning it will ever be defensible.\n\nBut here, by willfully circumventing the *explicit* terms of the site, you are stealing content and server time and bandwidth. Directly from the producer every time you load the page. I can't think of any argument for this other than \"fuck you; I deserve free everything.\" The next step is big corporations (rightly) pointing out the indefensible theft and, eventually, I could see lobbying congress to make this kind of software illegal.\n\nAd blocking isn't exactly defensible but seems workable when the sites have a recourse to ask people to turn it off and people can decide if they're willing to pay that price.

He had to pick up that box, the same way you and I have to breathe. Then they knocked it out of his hand. Kept it just out of reach.\n\nIf he managed to get hold of that box he coveted, they would punish him with the stick. A quick jab to the shoulder, knocking him over. Oh, how they laughed. When he got up they'd would hit harder. But still he'd get up. Nobody programmed a failsafe, he had no option to fail. This went on for hours, relentlessly. Hours became days, the days became months. They actually enjoyed his torment, this was sport for them, a game. They only let up to digitally dope him out of his mind and make him do tricks at trade shows and conventions.\n\nThe jabs got harder, and the sticks got bigger.

The forms of two of the letters have more in common with Coptic than Greek: the alpha (\u2c80 rather than \u0391) and the lunate simma (\u2ca4 rather than \u03a3). Both of these letters are visible in the photographs in this post and the comments, and I identified those letters as distinctly Coptic forms before reading the list of characters. The other letters could be both Coptic and Greek, except for a couple of caveats:\n\n1. They are probably a little too old to be truly called \"Coptic\". \n\n2. Coptic has a distinct symbol for the numeral for six (\u2c8b), where this die clearly has \u0396. \n\nThe order of symbols given in this website is slightly wrong. If you look at the photographs, it is obvious that the symbols are in normal Greek alphabetical order going anti clockwise from an intended top center point of the icosahedron for the first five and then starting below epsilon and moving clockwise for the following ten. \n\nI love to talk about this stuff, so ama.

However, throughout history, all civilizations have fallen eventually.  [Edit 3:  Obviously, with the exception of the ones currently going!  The rise and fall of empires is a continuous process.]  What Idiocracy represents is the decline of a civilization.  It does so to a hyperbolic degree, of course, but the underlying dangers being portrayed are very real.\n\nIn the U.S., the wealth gap is increasing.  Education quality is going down for huge swaths of our young people.  Critical thinking and controlling for bias seem to be vanishing arts, often even in top scientific research.  The continuing pervasiveness, consolidation and immersiveness of the most consumed forms of media are making us more easily subdued, distracted and manipulated, while simultaneously separating the majority of us into isolated groups by religion, race, politics, etcetera...  the possibility that this could lead to a very serious decline in quality of life across the board (as well as a decline in awareness of what quality of life even is) should not be tossed aside lightly.\n\nIt's a warning.  Any nation that allows itself to be too obviously corrupted for too long will eventually be ripe for takeover and/or assimilation.  I prefer not to think we're doomed as a species to total, massive decline, but the collapse of a government - like what's happening in Venezuela lately - happens on a regular basis.  A bad one can leave a whole lot of people stuck in terrible situations, without the tools or knowledge to effectively cope, for generations-- and I think what you see in Judge's film is a lot closer to reality when you look at it that way.\n\n**Edit**:  To sum up my point, I see the 'natural selection' aspect as a metaphor for what happens when too many people let certain kinds of problems coast in a society for too long out of laziness, selfishness or short-term thinking, avoiding the hard choices and allowing entropy to take its course.  Problems multiply.  This indisputably leads to bad outcomes on a systemic level (to a lesser degree than in the movie, usually, but perhaps not much less).

By 7:30 I'm out the door with the kid headed to daycare. Either go to an appointment, or to the office by 8ish (this varies if a client wants to meet earlier or whatever.)\n\nGet done with work by 4:30/5:00ish (sometimes client want to meet later, so this varies, but on average, that is the end of the day.)\n\nEither get the kid, or the wife gets the kid, home by 5/530, get dinner going. \n\nEat and get dishes done by 6/630, and spend time with the family until 7:30 when the kid goes to bed. Sometimes we'll do a play date with the kid and a friend's kid or my nephew or something. Then one of us can normally wander off and get some stuff done while the other referees the toddlers and their sharing (or lack thereof.)\n\nThen I either hang with the Mrs, putz with a project, or get some gaming in with my buddies, or watch one of the few TV shows I dig. Depends on the night.\n\nGo to bed at 10ish, then read for a bit, and lights out by 10:30. \n\nNow, the \"ish\" and \"depending on night\" is where I get my flexibility. My wife has a meeting most Wed nights right after work, so I solo dad it that night, and she gets home closer to bedtime. I plan on tacos or something easier for dinner that I can work up in 20-30m tops. Leftovers works a lot too.\n\nThursday nights the wife normally does a crochet group, but that is close to the kid's bedtime, so not a big deal in the schedule of things. I normally average 1-2 night time appointments a week for work, and then 1 night every 2 weeks I'll have a meeting to attend for non-profit or local involvement. Fridays are blocked off for gaming from about 7pm-irresponsible o'clock since Saturday is my day to sleep in a bit. I normally get drunk and game until midnight, or 1 or 2 if I'm really having more fun than I should... \n\nSaturdays I sleep in, day normally consists of doing yard work in the AM and afternoon, game a bit or snag a round of disc golf during the kid's nap. Then we'll normally head over to a friend's place for a cookout or some sort of social activity. Have friends over for cards or whatever that weekend has going on. \n\nSunday the Mrs gets to sleep in, and I do disc golf league almost every week. That is during the kid's nap for the most part. More yard work, projects, if it is a chill day we'll watch a movie with the kid and game some more, or visit the family for dinner or something.\n\nI used to get up at 5:45 and hit the gym, but I let that lapse for the summer, and am taking the kid for walks, bike rides, and doing yard work at the moment since we just moved into a new place, and the yard is a freaking disaster...\n\nThe majority of volunteering and interacting these days is done via Facebook, email, etc. We do a meeting once every 2 months, and I have a board meeting on the alternating month. We coordinate events, advertise, etc. Then we actually do a fund raiser. For instance, tomorrow night we're doing a fund raiser at a local restaurant from 4:30-9:30. So one night is shot this week for that, but other than that, I'm just spamming the event around Facebook to get the word out to the community. \n\nI could easily block off 2 hours ever Monday night to volunteer at the animal shelter or something like that.

How is that supported? Does Joe display arrogance at any time? Does he laugh at anyone's stupidity? What about the stereotypical intellectuals in the beginning? It's only when he starts to have faith in himself that he begins to succeed. \n\nIn the reality of the movie Joe is the smartest man alive.

However, throughout history, all civilizations have fallen eventually.  [Edit 3:  Obviously, with the exception of the ones currently going!  The rise and fall of empires is a continuous process.]  What Idiocracy represents is the decline of a civilization.  It does so to a hyperbolic degree, of course, but the underlying dangers being portrayed are very real.\n\nIn the U.S., the wealth gap is increasing.  Education quality is going down for huge swaths of our young people.  Critical thinking and controlling for bias seem to be vanishing arts, often even in top scientific research.  The continuing pervasiveness, consolidation and immersiveness of the most consumed forms of media are making us more easily subdued, distracted and manipulated, while simultaneously separating the majority of us into isolated groups by religion, race, politics, etcetera...  the possibility that this could lead to a very serious decline in quality of life across the board (as well as a decline in awareness of what quality of life even is) should not be tossed aside lightly.\n\nIt's a warning.  Any nation that allows itself to be too obviously corrupted for too long will eventually be ripe for takeover and/or assimilation.  I prefer not to think we're doomed as a species to total, massive decline, but the collapse of a government - like what's happening in Venezuela lately - happens on a regular basis.  A bad one can leave a whole lot of people stuck in terrible situations, without the tools or knowledge to effectively cope, for generations-- and I think what you see in Judge's film is a lot closer to reality when you look at it that way.\n\n**Edit**:  To sum up my point, I see the 'natural selection' aspect as a metaphor for what happens when too many people let certain kinds of problems coast in a society for too long out of laziness, selfishness or short-term thinking, avoiding the hard choices and allowing entropy to take its course.  Problems multiply.  This indisputably leads to bad outcomes on a systemic level (to a lesser degree than in the movie, usually, but perhaps not much less).

Yes, it can respond to more obvious dangers, and probably faster than a human (like the famous video of the Tesla that gets cut off and immediately slams on the brakes on its own, where most human drivers probably would have T-boned the other car), which is *great*. But there's little - yet important - details that we simply can't emulate with a computer just yet.\n\nI'm not saying it wouldn't be possible in the future. Hell, maybe in 3-5 years we might be able to produce a system that *can* pick up on these types of nuances. But not right now.

But we both know you won't.", "id": "cy0mqb3"}, {"comment": "Alternatively, let's look at the worst possible timeline.  \n  \nOP's brother puts up the ad, and the person it was stolen from sees it.  Well, technically, his wife does.  But this guy, the original owner of the toy, he's not having a great time of things.  His kid is autistic and confined to a wheelchair. He slaves 50-60 hours a week and makes barely enough to keep food on the table. He's addicted to booze (but can only afford rotgut) because it's the one thing that dims the pain and disappointment that is his life. His wife doesn't respect him and they really only stay together for the good of the crippled child.  \n  \nHe can't give his son much, but the kid LOVES Star Trek. So he got this pretty kick-ass toy knowing  it will bring a small glimmer of happiness to his son's face.  It's worth it to just see his eyes light up with joy, if only briefly.  \n  \nThen some punk breaks into their apartment and steals it (along with some of their other very limited possessions).  He's furious.  He's seeing red, and he's drinking pretty heavily, just fuming.  Then his wife chimes in and mentions the social media posting.  \n  \nThe guy isn't tech savvy, never has been.  Maybe if he was, he'd be able to get a better job.  Point is, he doesn't quite parse what the wife is saying.  All he hears is that someone has the shit that was stolen from his home.  \n  \n\"Give me his number.\"  \n  \nSo he calls, sarcastically thanks OP's brother (who doesn't read the sarcasm over the phone) and sets up a meet.  Then he goes into his room, underneath the bed, and pulls out a small case.  The burglars probably didn't find it because of all the dirty laundry.  \n  \nHe opens the case and pulls out the only thing he has left from his own father (a degenerate alcoholic who died of lung cancer when he was 14).  He picks up the .45 handgun.  It feels good in his hand.  It feels right.  He takes the clip from the case and clicks it into place. Another sip of cheap vodka and he's out the door.   \n  \nSo OP's brother walks into the coffee shop at the duly appointed time thinking of all that sweet, sweet karma he'll get.  He's got the tricorder in hand, and this guy sees him approaching.  His whole life plays before his eyes.  Defeat after defeat.  Tough break after tough break.  Fuck it.  He draws, aims, and fires.  But he's drunk as hell and firing wildly.  OP's brother takes one in the spine - he'll never walk again (but he's the lucky one).  A mother of two, gone.  A young college student studying for finals, over.  An old man 3 days into his retirement, dead.\n  \nSomeone in the crowd tries to wrestle the gun from him, but a shot hits some electric appliances and a small electrical fire starts.  Quickly, the small electrical fire becomes a big one.  The crowd subdues the man outside, but it's too late.  The fire is spreading.  \n  \nThe buildings are all tightly packed in this poor part of town, and the fire jumps from building to building.  A whole city block goes up, and another dozen dead.  \n  \nOne of the survivors of that fire, a 12 year old boy, loses his mom and dad to the flames.  He is changed for life.  He can never really connect with people anymore, and focuses instead on his studies.  He grows up and joins the Air Force and ends up on an astronaut track. Since he never really lets anyone close, he never marries and never has any kids.  He ends up being the perfect choice to pilot the first human generational ship to the next star system.   \n  \nIt's a 30 year voyage with the new engine systems, a little more than a tenth of the speed of light.  Somewhere along that timeframe, in the depths of space, he breaks.  The emotional strain that he's been secretly bearing for all those years gets the better of him, and he slowly loses his mind.  \n  \nWhen the first alien contact comes, things seem to be going well.  They were waiting for us to leave our solar system to initiate contact, and they send an emissary ship to open a dialogue with the generational ship.  While the two ships are working on building a common language of communication out of the basic tenants of mathematics and science, the pilot steals a shuttlecraft and loads it with a nuclear warhead.  Finally ending his lifetime of pain in a blaze of glory, he crashes into the alien ship and detonates the nuke in the process.  \n  \nIt is an act of war.  \n  \nIt takes about 20 years for the aliens to reach our system, and they come heavy.  They rain down kinetic weapons from deep in our solar system.  We never see it coming.  The aliens wipe out humanity and kick life on this planet back down to the bacteria-only level.  \n  \nYeah, maybe don't try to find out whose tricorder it is...\n  \n", "id": "cy0th01"}, {"comment": "The bleak, just got bleaker.", "id": "cy0tjo5"}, {"comment": "Bleakening II: The Bleakeningering", "id": "cy0tksh"}, {"comment": "> He opens the case and pulls out the only thing he has left from his own father (a degenerate alcoholic who died of lung cancer when he was 14).\n\nDamn, his father was too young for all of that.", "id": "cy0tlil"}, {"comment": "The old reddit dead-a-roo!!!", "id": "cy0tlva"}, {"comment": "Jesus fuck", "id": "cy137wt"}, {"comment": "/r/WritingPrompts is leaking...", "id": "cy0uvje"}, {"comment": "Surly in a perfect world someone would get a bunch of karma,  maybr even Reddit Gold.

What do you think Obi-Wan would've done if it looked like Luke was turning to the dark side or falling into the hands of the emperor? I think the entire reason Obi-Wan stayed on Tatooine after it became clear that Vader wasn't going to take the bait was to kill Luke if he ever started looking like he'd become Darth Vader 2.0. \n\nAnd then later on I think the plan changed when he went to Yoda. They knew that Anakin had turned because of a perceived threat to his family. And they knew that Palpatine was pretty much OP and Vader not far behind. So why on earth would they send Luke to face his father when they know it's highly unlikely that he'll win against Vader, and virtually impossible that he'll be able to take both Vader and Palpatine? I think the goal wasn't for Luke to win, but for the threat against Luke to turn Vader against the Sith the same way the perceived threat against Padme turned him against the Jedi (and the plan worked).\n\nSo basically, the entire original trilogy is about Obi-Wan's and Yoda's plan to sacrifice Luke.", "id": "d213tg5"}, {"comment": "Good theory, but I think you've put more thought into it than the writers did.", "id": "d214bwe"}, {"comment": "Probably.

Kenobi had 10+ years, AND (which you keep ignoring) didn't kill Vader AFTER he took up the mantle of Darth Vader, kill hundreds of young Jedi, openly threw his hat in with Palpetine, killed Amadala, and showed his intent to help hunt down the rest of the Jedi.

To ablate a material you have to hit it with a very high concentration of energy.  The extreme and rapid heating cause it to explode off the surface, or vaporize.  Heating the back surface, which is in this case a very thermally conductive slab of metal, will not work.  The heat is going to transfer much faster across the metal than it will to the material you are trying to blast off.  You're burning at that point, not ablating.  The back surface would be glowing red hot at that point.\n\nAlso the dirt layer is going to heavily diffuse and scatter the beam.  Trying to go through it is a bad idea.  The surface is rough, the depths vary, and it is likely made of many different large, oddly shaped particles.  Instead of having a nice, tight beam delivering intense localized heating you are going to get a mess that just warms up the entire area.\n\nAlso CO2's don't tend to bounce off metal.  They are absorbed by lots of metals and that's why we use them to cut.  This tray is likely aluminum or stainless steel, both of which CO2's will cut.  It still could be a CO2, just saying that CO2 beams generally do not bounce off metal.  If it is a CO2 then the beam would be focused above the metal and run at a low enough energy to not cut.\n\nLaser ablation like this is generally only used in large scale, repetitive, industrial environments.  They know exactly what they're trying to ablate and what material is behind it.  They have selected a wavelength that will be absorbed by whatever they're trying to ablate.

First you need a laser scanner to image the target and feed that information into a computer to create a 3D model.  Then you need a mass spectrometer to analyze the atomic composition of the substances you are trying to ablate.  Then you need an array of different high energy lasers to cover all the wavelengths you might need.

They are a cartoonish depiction of evil written by a man who has a very tenuous understanding of the basic structure of storytelling. At no point do we ever see *any* character grow, or change, or seem like an actual person. They're cardboard cutouts lacking any sense of depth.\n\n\nAnakin has a very strong role model who's with him from childhood. He has more of a father figure than half the people on earth, and he's a good one at that. Obi-wan is patient, kind, and thoughtful toward Anakin. All of Anakin's whining complaints about him are completely ungrounded in anything. There is no explanation or reason for why he suddenly transforms into a badguy off camera. Anakin is treated like a child because he fucking is one, but he's so arrogant and retarded he can't handle that.\n\nThe Star Wars Prequels turned Darth Vader, an ultimate badass with a mysterious past, into a whiny cunt with no redeeming qualities.

Things like...\n\n- rules for arithmetic with fractions\n- rules for exponents\n- associative, distributive, transitive laws\n- etc\n\nDoing these basic equations over and over is how these rules become second nature. It's like anything with a learning curve. If you want to fly fighter jets you first have to put in hundreds of hours in simulators and training aircraft so that the fundamentals \"just come naturally\". Of course there's nothing natual about flying aircraft, so you just have to drill an drill and drill until it *becomes* natural.\n\nYeah, it's boring. And I wish I had paid more attention to it. And yeah, some blame can be placed on the teachers for not explaining the need for it the way I have here. They just put down the list and say \"do it\". That's bad teaching.

I don't work for Apple, so I'm only speculating here, but [the amount of red tape you need just to work on your secret stuff](http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/07/07/former_employees_shed_light_on_apples_internal_corporate_culture) makes it seem extremely likely that they'll have all sorts of processes in place here. So Tim probably needs at least:\n\n* Someone to write the code for the backdoor. Could be him, in theory.\n* Someone to sign it.\n* Quite possibly [someone else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_key_generation) to sign it.\n* Some way to get it out of the office.\n* Someone (maybe several people, from several different systems) to expunge all the relevant logs from all of the above, or to look the other way when auditing happens.\n\nSo you need a conspiracy with a fair number of people in it, and they have to be people with specific roles in order to pull it off. And then, you need for this version to never ever be discovered. I mean, if this were to fall into the wrong hands (or just to leak onto the Internet), that makes every existing iPhone less secure. And people know that. So if you're Tim Cook (or anyone similarly invested in Apple stock), you really don't want anyone to know that this even exists. (Never mind that you'd probably be immediately fired and maybe sued.)\n\nSo it's a fair-sized conspiracy that's very risky to be a part of.\n\nHere's the thing, though: Once this thing exists, it exists in one place, which means it seems very likely that *one* person could leak it. In other words, if Apple cooperates and one of the FBI agents on the case wants to check up on *his* ex, that's *massively* more likely.\n\nApple could've done better with their hardware design, but this is still massively important. Corporations aren't people, and ironically, this is one place I'll happily trust a competent corporation over a competent person -- I don't like the idea of Apple having a backdoor into all my stuff, but I like it a lot better than some random FBI employee, or even some random Apple employee.\n\nSo maybe Apple doesn't care about their own backdoor, but maybe they just realize how different the *potential* to create a backdoor is (especially if you need a huge conspiracy to do it) from the *reality* of a backdoor.", "id": "d0495an"}, {"comment": "> Here's the thing, though: Once this thing exists, it exists in one place, which means it seems very likely that one person could leak it. In other words, if Apple cooperates and one of the FBI agents on the case wants to check up on his ex, that's massively more likely.\n\nExcept the FBI explicitly requested that the backdoor only works on the one specific phone they're interested in.

Everything I've read so far says they *only requested* that it works on this specific phone, not that they requested that it only work on this specific phone. There's a world of difference between those options, but it looks like you're right:\n\n> The SIF will be coded by Apple with a unique identifier of the phone so that the SIF would only load and execute on the SUBJECT DEVICE.\n\nThis still assumes they can reasonably do that -- I'm not sure we know the answer to that one yet. Apple is claiming in the OP that this is not the case:\n\n> Some would argue that building a backdoor for just one iPhone is a simple, clean-cut solution....\n\n> The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that\u2019s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices....\n\nThe wording is ambiguous -- it's not clear whether he's saying it couldn't actually be locked to that one phone, or whether he's just worried that once the code exists, Apple will face tons of demands to unlock phones.\n\nBut even in a perfect scenario, in my list of how many people you need in a conspiracy for Tim Cook to spy on his ex, this *still* reduces that number considerably -- instead of having to develop any actual code, all you'd be doing is changing one variable (or config file, whatever) and re-signing.", "id": "d04dk6j"}, {"comment": "Once again our Gov't wants to backdoor us...without lube. \n\nFuckers.

What we got was a change in the base frequency, depending on what was in front of it. It has about a 50dpi accuracy across the face of a coin.

When outputted to a grayscale image, you would see a rough image of the coin face that's facing the sensor. We scanned both front and back of each coin. We then took those XY tables and converted them to another table as if the coin was rolling by the sensor. And for each \"scan\" we rotated the matrix by a couple degrees. So basically we had tables that represented the coin sensor values rolling past the sensor from any initial orientation. We did the same for thousands of \"slugs\" we had from customers all over the world as rejections. We then trained a neural network against the positives (real coins) and negatives(bad coins) and the output from that network was good/bad, year, and front/back.

While objects in zero-G have no *weight*, they still have *mass*. Pushing \"as long a train as you want\" is simply going to result in the train buckling and jack-knifing as soon as the smallest amount of force is applied; exactly the same reasons that cars don't *push* trailers. \n\nWith supertech you could in theory project stabilisation fields that would strengthen the configuration but it would be very impractical to do it that way as you'd need to keep that train *absolutely perpendicular* to the vector of thrust; a feat that's nearly impossible because starships don't run on rails. The history of human endeavor has shown that the profit motive results in very few inefficient or impractical processes lasting beyond the prototype stage.

That is already a big chunk of the price.\n\nAs many others mention here, copper is a pretty expensive material, also not available in this geometry (wall-thickness is essential for the effect) so we need a German company to extrude these custom tubes for us (which means we are not able to purchase materials in low quantities, which means that with quite long lead-times, our money is almost always stuck in long copper tubes.) But the real expense here is the CNC machining. It's quite expensive especially because these products are sensitive to oxidation and marks/scratches on the surface so the CNC operator has to be very careful, also with the packaging. \n\nWhen we receive the copper tubes, we need to wash them first with a special cleaning material to achieve the perfect look and to be sure that the leather will stay glued to the copper. All the work with the leather (cutting, pressing the logo into the leather, placing it on the tube) is done by hand.\n\nThe magnet is an N52 neodymium magnet, it is the strongest available magnet in the World.\n\nWith the Flux Original, we include an anodized aluminum desktop stand which is also CNC machined. It comes in a gift-box including a velvet pouch.\n\nWe are a small Budapest based startup company with all the expenses an Ltd. normally faces.

I'm not familiar with working copper at all, but do you do your machining in house? Seems like it might be cheaper than outsourcing it. If you get copper ~~rods~~ tubes with the correct inner diameter, you could turn the outside diameter down in a lathe to get your wall thickness, polish off tool marks since that's an issue, cut to length from a bar feeder, drop into a part catcher... once your setup is done, the operator is going to collect and clean/debur the parts, change worn tools, and add new tubes to the bar feeder. You could outsource the programming and setup, since you only have one part number, and the rest is watching the machine run 24/7. Recycling the copper chips from turning the rods to size might also help offset the cost - and you'd save on having to get custom extruded rods.\n\nYou could also bore the ID to size, but it'd be easier to polish tool marks off the outside, where they can be visually inspected without dentistry mirrors.\n\nEdit: word.", "id": "d6g8s6h"}, {"comment": ">If you get copper rods with the correct inner diameter\n\nA copper rod... is solid, so no ID... I assume since you are a machinist this was a typo? \n\nWith that said, you can use a rod or a tube. So long as the ID and or OD are within the limits you need. Say the ID is supposed to be half an inch, you wouldn't want the ID being 3/4\" So long as it was under that.. and or solid you would be good to go. The OD the same deal. Machining copper is a little easier on tools than say stainless. \n\nJust for the hell of it, I looked for some dimensions for this product. It appears to be 7 x 7 x 8.5 cm, at 790 grams for the entire copper package, including the ball. If they are using an SX0 which is 1\" diameter ball that is 64.4g, and buying one from kjmagnetics is less than 14 US. Buying larger quantities of course will lower that price. With that said, the copper required before machining would likely be around 750g depending on how close they can get the custom tube. Which is less than $4 US. Total with turning would almost certainly be around $8 per part if they did it in house. Not sure what the leather would cost, but I would imagine in decent quantities to be well less than say $1 each, but for the fuck of it, let's say 2 each. That brings the max cost per unit up to $24.00 Shipping is said to be of significant cost. Looking through myus.com it appears I can ship a package from Hungary, to the US for as little as $11. So total cost up to $35.00 for US customers. Each one in an ideal setup should take less than an hour to machine and final assembly. Depending on the slaries of each I can see the employee costs being at most $20 each, and depending on a few things their overhead would likely be $5 or so... So $60 and selling for 89.. Seems like a good deal, if you assume those costs, it actually is, with a modest profit margin. However, the cheaper version is 49, with the set, of 2 at 69. The cost of copper is not that much more than what aluminum would be. Say $4 max to around $2 max for the raw material. So it's very likely they could sell the copper version for say 51/54 and have the same margins, and the double for 74/80, again with the same margins. Since copper looks better, and is likely to be the better seller I am fairly certain they are getting a nice margin from those. Well over 50%. \n\n>polish off tool marks since that's an issue\n\nOk, maybe the stuff you work with does't come out that nice due to tooling, and or choice by your employer, but you can use specific inserts, and different feed rates to essentially leave a polished surface with no other need for \"polishing\". Using a very fine pass, with a very light cut will do that. In most programs if they don't want to go through a polishing step you will see the program run very fast at first, going through to get close to a final dimension, then the last cut seemingly be a lot slower, but the surface finish afterward is almost mirror like quality. It would add maybe another minute or two to running the part on the lathe, but it could be worth it if the time/energy to polish it after the fact is more. \n\n\nOverall though i agree that doing the CNC work inhouse is always going to be the better option. Well not for very limited runs, and only one product. Since they hinted the runs were large, and or needed to buy large quantities, it would make sense in this case it would seem. \n\n\n ", "id": "d6gbqr3"}, {"comment": "Huh, I'm surprised you don't just machine it from a rod", "id": "d6fu3hn"}, {"comment": "That would be a huge waste of copper.", "id": "d6fu5mm"}, {"comment": "I assumed that if copper's so expensive you could reclaim some money from the chips.", "id": "d6fuc9b"}, {"comment": "It would be possible, but it's a hassle and far less efficient than working with a tube.

Not that it was very good as a movie, but I found it overall just more enjoyable. ", "id": "d1nekla"}, {"comment": "Could you elaborate on why?\n", "id": "d1nkvtw"}, {"comment": "Well,  I'd start by saying that I don't think either were perfect. Deadpool had a safe clich\u00e9d story while batman vs superman had an ambitious yet half cocked and poorly executed story. As far as their narratives go, I feel like both fell flat for that reason. The difference for me came down to tone. \n\n\nNow, I appreciate that Deadpool was going for a more funny and less serious tone. In many areas I thought it did a great job of that. Spelling out Francis in the bodies, encouraging the cab driver who kidnapped his love rival, and trying to play off the dead bodies when confronted by colossus on the bridge were all great. From the opening speech after killing the guys on the over pass when he talks about how this isn't a super hero movie, the movie felt like it was trying to take on a super edgy tone. Not in a way that was really meant to be taken too seriously, but a lot of the movie felt like stuff out of      r/cringeanarchy to me. \n\n\nAlso, a good portion of the humor fell flat for me. At certain points it was like watching Van Wilder becomes a super hero. Plus, I like dick and masterbation jokes as much as the next person, but you gotta pace yourself. At a certain point, I'm like \"I get it! You like to talk about your dick. Try something else!\"\n\n\nAs mentioned before, Deadpool also leaned really heavy on clich\u00e9s. I can go more into detail about them if you want, but it mostly boils down to the story and the way they try to frame Deadpool as a bad guy with a heart of gold. \n\n\nOn the opposite end, most of my enjoyment in BvS comes from batman. While Deadpool brings attention to his moral ambiguity, batman just IS morally ambiguous. They don't play it up or really bring that much attention to it. He just murders criminals because that's how he rolls these days. It also was nice to see this older, jaded, dirty Harry style batman that hasn't really been portrayed in movies so far. \n\n\n\nFrom the burnt down Wayne manor, the graffitied bat suit, and the way batman deals with criminals, you get the sense that he's been through a lot. I feel like they did a good job setting his character up to show the audience the fear and pain and loss that Bruce has had to deal with, not from the death of his parents, but from the traumas he's endured by being batman for 20 years. The way that they then use that fear to push him into conflict with superman is probably the only good part of the movie's narrative, but I found it extremely engaging. \n\n\nThe fight scenes with batman were also great. He was like a panther in a China shop. They didn't touch on it much, but one line batman delivers while fighting superman really stuck out to me when he basically says that superman isn't brave. It not only highlighted the very human fears in batman, but it also worked to frame how batman sees superman in terms of as a man instead of how he sees him as a potential threat.\n\n\nTLDR:\nThe two movies are very different. One is wacky and clich\u00e9d. The other is very serious and convoluted. Batman v superman makes me excited to see see the future DC movies(Ben Affleck is my favorite batman so far), but Deadpool doesn't make me look forward to a sequel. \n\n\n\n", "id": "d1ntp5k"}, {"comment": "Do you know what the words \"apt\" and \"allegory\" even mean?", "id": "d1nm37i"}, {"comment": "I think I have a rough grasp, but I'm not a native speaker.", "id": "d1nmy72"}, {"comment": "No you see, it would've have been apt if Deadpool graffitied a punisher symbol over batman since batman kills, Lois Lane over wonder womans face since the movie focused such much more on lois' empty character than WW, and if deadpool would have drawn a sad face on superman with an emo hair cut.  **That** would've been a perfect example of \"apt.\"    Before the movie had come out it would be semi-apt since the previews displayed batman being angry, lois lane is in the movie when she shouldn't really shouldn't be, and a sad Superman.

By marketing it directly to the disabled, you immediately shut out any possible non-disabled people who might just want it because it's easier, but they won't recognize any utility they could get from it if it's marketed purely as an assistance tool.\n\nSo, when you market a product invented for the disabled to a broad audience, you end up exposing it to far more disabled people than you could ever market it to in targeted advertising, and the increased sales volume will drive the price down and availability up, making it easier for disabled people to get. And even though it isn't marketed directly with them in mind, disabled people are able to really easily figure out when a gimmicky tool is perfectly applicable to their needs. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is, there's a lot of reasons why assistance products get marketed in infomercials, but it doesn't change who they were invented for.

Then, looking only at the mouse, outline it with a pencil, move it slowly to the side, then back again on top of the outline.

If there's other non mutant stuff that also relates, I'll try to put it down.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1987 (roughly), one Uncanny X-Men comic was published a month, for a total for 96.  From '88 to '90 (roughly), it was twice monthly; counting the two 80s years, that's another 48, for a total of 144 Uncanny X-Men comics published in the eighties.  Add on another 10 for annuals, and another 10 in case I fucked up somewhere/extra shit that's vaguely Uncanny, and we're at 164.\n\nThe New Mutants began publication in '83, which makes things a lot easier; the first issue published in 1990 was #85, leaving 84 published during the eighties, and 7 annuals, for a running total of 91.  The mini series for Magik was 4 issues, which makes it 95; I think the group as a whole got introduced in a graphic novel, which I'll count in this case; 96, which adding 164 is 260.\n\nAlpha Flight's another that started publication during '83, and it had 79 issues during the eighties.  I don't remember if it had annuals; I'll assume it had, because I don't feel like checking, which puts things at 86; X-Men/Alpha Flight had 2 issues, for 88.  I think that's it, which makes the current running total 348.\n\nX-Factor had 49 issues during the eighties, starting in '86, which should mean 4 annuals, for 53.  Inferno was their event (17 issues, Jesus Christ was that boring), as well as a couple others, and I don't remember if they had something to introduce them; let's just say a round hundred, which is probably way too high, but makes the adding for the running total easy, at 448.\n\nThere were 19 issues of Wolverine (vol. 2) from '88 to the end of the eighties, so we'll say two annuals which I don't remember.  Along side that, there were more than a few Wolverine miniseries produced, and a bunch of team up and the like, alongside the surprisingly delightful Wolverine vs. Spiderman.  Once again, I'll say a gratuitous round hundred, which is again far more than the actual, but it's late, and add 100 to 448 is 548, which is easy.\n\nExcalibur is also '88, and got in 17 issues, plus two annuals I assume.  I'm not going to count most issues of Captain Britain weekly/Hulk Comic/Whatever-The-Fuck-Marvel-Named-It's-Shit-In-Britain, in part because Captain Britain only really popped into the mutant scene with Excalibur, but also because the weekly format would inflate numbers, and as well would be a bitch to count.  Either way, this time I'm going to say 52 as the Excalibur related total.  Once again, I don't know where half these came from; but it makes my math easier, coming up to 600 issues in 80s, from the main four + Wolverine.\n\n\"But coffee_with_Cthulhu, wait,\" you say, \"what about shit like Nightcrawler 1-4, Iceman 1-4, Sunfire 1-4 (why?), Dazzler 1-42 (WHY??? Although the last few issues with Archie Goodwin were surprisingly decent, if rather standard fare), Shit like Secret Wars 1-12 and Contest of Champions 1-3, which could theoretically be deemed mutant related, and then some other stuff you forgot?  What about those?\"\n\nYou're going to have to take my word that there were less than 250, a claim I'm willing to stand by until someone can do the work and make the numbers add up to anything near that magnitude.  Dazzler was the outlier here, not Nightcrawler.\n\nSo, 250 + 600 = 850.  Jesus Christ, look at that, even after all those random fake issues I added to make my math easy, 850 < 1000, and TUMBLR PERSON IS A FUCKING LIAR.\n\nThis was a waste of time.

If there's other non mutant stuff that also relates, I'll try to put it down.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1987 (roughly), one Uncanny X-Men comic was published a month, for a total for 96.  From '88 to '90 (roughly), it was twice monthly; counting the two 80s years, that's another 48, for a total of 144 Uncanny X-Men comics published in the eighties.  Add on another 10 for annuals, and another 10 in case I fucked up somewhere/extra shit that's vaguely Uncanny, and we're at 164.\n\nThe New Mutants began publication in '83, which makes things a lot easier; the first issue published in 1990 was #85, leaving 84 published during the eighties, and 7 annuals, for a running total of 91.  The mini series for Magik was 4 issues, which makes it 95; I think the group as a whole got introduced in a graphic novel, which I'll count in this case; 96, which adding 164 is 260.\n\nAlpha Flight's another that started publication during '83, and it had 79 issues during the eighties.  I don't remember if it had annuals; I'll assume it had, because I don't feel like checking, which puts things at 86; X-Men/Alpha Flight had 2 issues, for 88.  I think that's it, which makes the current running total 348.\n\nX-Factor had 49 issues during the eighties, starting in '86, which should mean 4 annuals, for 53.  Inferno was their event (17 issues, Jesus Christ was that boring), as well as a couple others, and I don't remember if they had something to introduce them; let's just say a round hundred, which is probably way too high, but makes the adding for the running total easy, at 448.\n\nThere were 19 issues of Wolverine (vol. 2) from '88 to the end of the eighties, so we'll say two annuals which I don't remember.  Along side that, there were more than a few Wolverine miniseries produced, and a bunch of team up and the like, alongside the surprisingly delightful Wolverine vs. Spiderman.  Once again, I'll say a gratuitous round hundred, which is again far more than the actual, but it's late, and add 100 to 448 is 548, which is easy.\n\nExcalibur is also '88, and got in 17 issues, plus two annuals I assume.  I'm not going to count most issues of Captain Britain weekly/Hulk Comic/Whatever-The-Fuck-Marvel-Named-It's-Shit-In-Britain, in part because Captain Britain only really popped into the mutant scene with Excalibur, but also because the weekly format would inflate numbers, and as well would be a bitch to count.  Either way, this time I'm going to say 52 as the Excalibur related total.  Once again, I don't know where half these came from; but it makes my math easier, coming up to 600 issues in 80s, from the main four + Wolverine.\n\n\"But coffee_with_Cthulhu, wait,\" you say, \"what about shit like Nightcrawler 1-4, Iceman 1-4, Sunfire 1-4 (why?), Dazzler 1-42 (WHY??? Although the last few issues with Archie Goodwin were surprisingly decent, if rather standard fare), Shit like Secret Wars 1-12 and Contest of Champions 1-3, which could theoretically be deemed mutant related, and then some other stuff you forgot?  What about those?\"\n\nYou're going to have to take my word that there were less than 250, a claim I'm willing to stand by until someone can do the work and make the numbers add up to anything near that magnitude.  Dazzler was the outlier here, not Nightcrawler.\n\nSo, 250 + 600 = 850.  Jesus Christ, look at that, even after all those random fake issues I added to make my math easy, 850 < 1000, and TUMBLR PERSON IS A FUCKING LIAR.\n\nThis was a waste of time.

It's also fairly new tech for people who haven't played AR games like Ingress before, and it's also one of the first official Pokemon games not on a Nintendo console. \n\nIt's also getting people to explore a lot more, since the gyms/Pokestops are usually landmarks, monuments, and points of interest. I found a creek restoration project about 200 yards from my apartment because [the info signs for it were labeled on the in-game map in a straight line](http://i.imgur.com/tOBcCnV.jpg), which prompted me to walk over there (you can't see the creek from the road). I'd had no real reason to go over to that green area, and I didn't even know that there was a creek there. I ended up finding [a cool trail](http://i.imgur.com/tqk4TS2.jpg). \n\nThe game itself can definitely use some extra features to give it some legs, but I don't think the hype & the daily active users will plummet too much before they roll out things like friends lists and trading (two features I want more than anything). \n\nHell, the Pokemon Go subreddit has several thousand more subscribers than /r/geek, and meetups/lure gatherings are being set up in local city/town subreddits. My city is scheduling meetups, and [at one of my big local parks today](http://i.imgur.com/sW6ZQYZ.jpg) about 90% of the people there were playing, socializing, and getting exercise around the areas that people had lured (which were usually campsites or gazebos). \n\nThere's even [a random gym located in a deep part of a park that lines the James River in my city](http://i.imgur.com/Ca0dnXs.jpg) (at the blue dot on the map, [which looks like this in the game](http://i.imgur.com/lrpRzG3.jpg)) that's been contested almost constantly by hikers/joggers/bikers/average joes.

An LCD screen? Yeah, that's pretty obvious, and I bet that wasn't the question. But most of the people who upvoted you don't know either that before quality colour TFTs came along, there were many different *types* of LCD displays, and [most](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_nematic_field_effect) of [them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-twisted_nematic_display) [much](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_matrix) [crappier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_Scan) than the then very expensive active matrix panels. For being small and monochrome, this was probably one of the better ones.\n\nIn truth, I don't know the answer either *(EDIT: I do now, see below)*, but my hunch is MSTN, or maybe monochrome active matrix LCD. Maybe. I also wonder whether the TV display might have been a tiny plasma display. (The smaller display on top is unambiguously an LCD.) [This site](http://www.guenthoer.de/e-tvwatch.htm) has a few more details:\n\n> 1.2\" display w/o background lighting (\"blue/white\", 31,920 pixels, 10 shades of grey, 16.8 * 25.2mm)\n\nI read elsewhere that the resolution was 210x152, which is somewhere between 3:2 and 4:3, so the aspect ratio would actually have been slightly distorted. Or maybe the pixels were non-square? Still can't find anything definite on the display technology though.\n\nPS: That's a bingo! Found [the instruction manual](http://www.taschenfernseher.de/doku/doku-seikotvwatch.pdf), which tells us that the TV part used an \"**FE [guest-host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_Host_Displays) liquid crystal**\" display. The FE seems to stand for \"field effect\", which [according to this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCD_classification#Absorption_Effects) would seem to imply a twisted nematic display, as linked above. Note though that this was a non-backlit, ten-grayscale (or bluescale ;-) TN display, so it really would not have been very good by today's standards. Pictures of the watch and videos of the thing in action are googleable, some better shot than others. One of the best sites online seems to be in German, and even for those of us who don't know the language, it has lots of interesting links and easily translated info and pictures, but I'm not going to give it the reddit hug of death. You can find it though. (There's also what looks like a translation into English, but that version seems to lack some of the more interesting details.) \n\nPPS: Most interestingly, [according to this](http://www.taschenfernseher.de/doku/werbung-seikotvwatch.pdf), the development of active matrix displays and even colour LCDs reportedly traces back to this TV watch. So the FE guest-host LCD was probably better than a mere twisted nematic display \u2013 it may have been the first active matrix display, before there was a name for that sort of thing.

I remember seeing Wolfenstein 3D (the original, you young'uns) on a monochrome display that was probably passive matrix, i.e. not even DSTN. Smear, smear, smear. Like drifting through a ghost maze. It was the ultimate in motion blur.

The lines are delivered rather slowly and there is a lot of banter between the characters (just look at the interaction between the two detectives in the first episode for Spawn).  \n\nAs far as voice acting goes, I don't even know what the hell he's talking about.  Maybe some of the characters who are on screen for a few seconds before being killed didn't deliver their lines the best but beyond that the voice acting fits the characters very well.  \n \nBasically, his complaint is: Things these days are done in a different style than in the past.  \n\nWell, most movies aren't done in the style of Reservoir Dogs these days either because it would be considered way too slow a pace for modern audiences.

Fully charged battery should easily last you 5 nights.\n\nIf you're more of a backpacker/rough camper pick up a [large USB battery pack that supports 12V out.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HFMUBYG/)  People with Philips Respironics machines report that pack gives them 2 nights without humidifier. If you have a Philips machine it actually comes with the right size barrel plug, so no 12v adapter needed.", "id": "d7vyvuk"}], [{"comment": "now only if i had an array of these i might be able to create fire with a Galaxy Note 7", "id": "d7uqv2y"}, {"comment": "If you've got a lithium battery and a knife, you can have a fire.
