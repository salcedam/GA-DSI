And I guarantee they won't allow any mods.", "id": "d90oe1l"}, {"comment": "Where are Microsoft and Sony's handhelds? And before you say Vita, nobody cares about that shit. Nobody but Nintendo has really had any success with handhelds. Well, aside from smartphones, of course. When it comes to portable gaming, gaming laptops aside (and those don't even rate), popularity wise it's the 3DS/DS and the iPhone, with Android gaming trailing behind that, and they've all lapped the Vita at least once.\n\nYou're right about the mods though. Everyone's hoping and I don't want to ruin their day, but yeah, this will be 110% unmoddable. You might have hope if you could export your save. Remember, the Xbox 360 version had mods, but you had to work it into the save game. So somebody would take a save from the PC version, and put mods right into the save (and they were limited to in-game assets and no scripts), and then you put the save on a memory stick. I never did it with Skyrim, but I did do it with Fallout 3. Yeah. I played a modded Fallout 3 on 360. It started you at level 30, gave you all the perks, started you at Rivet City (the aircraft carrier), and increased the enemy spawns by about 10x, with legendary weapons to find (basically just had higher stats, no added effects). Tons of stuff on YouTube about this if anyone wants to look, just search \"Skyrim/Fallout 3 360 modded save.\" So what I'm saying with the 110%, I don't believe you'll be able to inject a modded save into the Switch version. You'd need some kind of adapter. Either the saves will be on the game cart like Nintendo usually does, or internal storage... possibly a separate memory card like PS Vita does, but I doubt it.\n\nGoing back to the 5 year claim... Nintendo is 5 years behind in the sense the iPhone is 5 years behind... as in, it really isn't, it just has a different set of goals. And that's a bad example as the 2015 iPhone 6s's A9 chip smokes the Snapdragon 820s used this year in Android smartphones. Not sure about 821 yet, or next year's 830, but I bet they don't catch up to the iPhone 7's A10 Fusion chip. But then you see the iPhone 7 running at a hair over 720p and say \"Hey! Android's had full HD for like five years (more like 3 or 4) and 2K/4K for like a year or two! They're so behind!\" Only they're not. I mean, you can't even get a normal sized Android flagship phone, because those high rez screens demand a massive battery. And even if you slap a 720p screen on, Android drinks battery like a frat boy drinks cheap beer.

Their lust for the extermination of Dragons doesn't mean a thing. They do what they are told, or they don't get to be Blades anymore.\n\nEsbern and Delphine are **not** Blades, they are traitors. They didn't seek out the Dragonborn so they could uphold their oaths. They sat on their asses hiding from the Thalmor until you proved you were the Dragonborn. And then what did they do? They stole an artifact you needed to save the world all so they could perform a little \"test\" to see if you were truly the Dragonborn. Last time I checked, it was the Greybeards that decided who is or isn't Dragonborn, not the Blades.\n\nBut no, that wasn't good enough for them. They had to insinuate themselves into the middle of your quest to save the fucking world, all so they could \"test\" you their way. And that test proved what, exactly? That you were able to dive a dungeon that Delphine survived, all to retrieve an artifact that by all rights would already have been in your possession had these ass-clowns not involved themselves in the first place? Some fucking test...\n\nThey don't care about being loyal to you. They don't care about protecting you. All they care about is returning to the lives of relative luxury and power they enjoyed as members of the Blades, and seeking revenge against the Thalmor. Delphine all but makes this clear to you when she's bitching about her life. In fact, the only main quest in the entire game that has you directly interfering with the Thalmor is the one given to you by Delphine because \"she thinks they are responsible for the Dragons\". Their importance to the story is so minor that there's only 2 quests in the game involving the Thalmor, and one of those is a side quest, yet Delphine immediately wants you to fuck with them.\n\nAnd as soon as Alduin is dead and it seems like the Blades are on a direct track to return, what's the very first thing they do? They prove their true natures by demanding that you, the person they've sworn to protect and obey, kill an ally that's directly responsible for their return to power as well as the world's continued existence.\n\nThink about that for a moment. They witnessed it first hand. They know Paarthurnax is a good guy. They know he helped you in a major way. They **know** that the entirety of Reality would be gone had Paarthurnax not aided you. They still want you to kill him. So... what makes you think you're not the next name on their list?\n\nEsbern and Delphine are selfish, opportunistic traitors. The \"Kill Paarthurnax\" quest needs a hidden third option where-by an NPC at the Thalmor Embassy gains a new dialog option that, when chosen, allows you to rat out Esbern and Delphine's location so they can be rounded up and executed.

They were disbanded when Reman III was assassinated and only reemerged as the Blades 854 years later. Serving then as the intelligence service directly under Emperor Tiber Septim. Their dragonslaying role now just revered legends.\n\nThey serve the Septim empire dutifully for 475 years, and are again thrown into disarray when Uriel Septim VII is assassinated (they're not very good at this bodyguarding business). When Titus Mede is crowned emperor 17 years later they sort of go with it but their main business is observing this new Thalmor threat that's rising in Summerset Isles. After some 180 years of infiltration and espionage, they are all but wiped out when the Thalmor present Titus Mede II all the heads of Blades agents undercover in Dominion territory sparking the Great War.\n\nWhen we meet Esbern and Delphine their entire order is sundered, the dragonslaying business is some 1300 years in the past, fabled myths at that point. They haven't had a Akatosh sanctioned Dragonborn to guard for over 200 years. I think Delphine is trying to uphold a forgotten role to the letter: Wiping out all dragons.

I'm a composer myself, and there are always talks about simplicity vs. complexity, and I don't think that the complexity of a music has anything to do with the quality whatsoever. I have heard beautiful and awful music that is complex, and the same applies to simple. I'm going to ramble for a bit.\n\nAn approachable example of music that is orchestrationally complex is anything written by Toru Takemitsu. The pitches are generally based off of some variant of a pentatonic scale in his mid through later work, (he actually superimposes them in a really cool way that I won't bother talking about), but the complexity is in his orchestration. His music can sound very simple, but the score is staggering in how precise everything is. Not everyone will like it, but this is gorgeous and complex music that I love to death.\n\n[To the Edge of Dream for guitar and orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RN1jCLfJ9A)\n\nThere are all of these extremely, extremely tiny nuances that can go unnoticed that make the work beautiful. 1:15, for example. Listen to the orchestra part. You can barely hear it, but there are this tiny, soft flutters and plucks in the background to compliment the guitar. They are barely noticeable, but the rhythms and dynamics are terrifyingly precise.\n\nThen we have something like the movement from Arcadiana by Thomas Ades called [O Albion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP5__SSf3dk). It doesn't get much more simple than this. String quartet, four part writing, extremely bare counterpoint, extremely simple rhythms, extremely simple motivic material. Up a step->down a leap->up a step->down a leap etc. And that is the stuff of the movement. It is very simple and very beautiful.\n\nThat said, the simplicity of much video game music (definitely in terms of aesthetics and not execution) has been really good for a lot of composers. I have a composer friend named Dai Fujikura who writes some amazingly complex material ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuDXCQ5lPRM) is his flute concerto) that may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is some of the most beautiful music to me. It reminds me a lot of Takemitsu. You know what else it reminds me of? Dragon Quest. Take something like [this](https://youtu.be/McYBobLtZCs?t=24m6s) and then go back and compare it to the flute concerto. The ghost of that material is there, they are both very good musics, the only difference being that the Dragon Quest music is much more transparent. I've had many conversations with Dai about our musical upbringings. The music from Final Fantasy is what got me wanting to be a composer. For him, seeing a concert of orchestrated Dragon Quest music when he was a kid in the '80s is one of the things that did it for him. These simple pieces of music in video games give us our initial spark, and we take a lot from them. Even if we go on to write weird shit that we love, we can trace a lot of the aesthetic back to video game music. That simplicity is good. Side note: he is friends with Koji Kondo. Another side note: Nintendo wanted to collaborate with him at one point, but it never panned out. I'm pushing for him to get something going there, so you might hear it in a game in the future.\n\nIn summary, the simple is good because it lets us latch on to things easily as composers. If a piece that we are writing is heavily melodic, video games have been very good about memorable melodies. If not, there are other qualities that make it memorable (the counterpoint of proximity created in Banjo Kazooie when you switch areas and the orchestration changes is something I am applying to an actual acoustic piece that will be premiering in 2020ish). Also, Jeremy Soule seems to think very highly of himself and very not highly of the musical capabilities of others.

It is supposed to promote a visceral response in the viewer/player, not cause them to sit back and close their eyes and appreciate the genius of the music.  \n\nMost of the most famous film scores out there are so not because of their complexity but because of  their association with the *feeling* we got from hearing it while watching the movie.  John Williams, for example.  That fanfare opening of the Star Wars theme; I hear that brass and suddenly I'm a little kid again seeing it for the first time; in reality a lot of his themes and stuff are lifted from greater composers, for example he seems to have especially taken inspiration from Bach; but his own genius is putting the scores together in a package that doesn't just complement the film, but makes it better by driving home the excitement, tension, jubilation, and everything, on a multi-sensory level.   That fanfare at the start signals you right there that something epic is going to happen; then after the introduction it quiets down, shifts becomes lighter and more  pensive, gearing us down for the beginning of the story.  \n\nBut if we listen to the music by itself, without the pretty lights and everything, we can pick apart very quickly its simplicity, and even an amateur musician would have little trouble replicating it by ear.

He's in his total right to be offended that he wasn't brought onto this Bethesda-Sponsored event, but going so far as to say that it won't be an authentic experience is a bit much.\n\n**EDIT:** [Here's an article](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwjf_f7i-rnPAhUJyoMKHemWBrQQFggcMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tentonhammer.com%2Fnews%2Fclass-action-lawsuit-for-directsong&usg=AFQjCNGiWcZrX0vkQWSMIMDBz36S4pMKUA&sig2=pX8yFjmENOv8A2iZ5_fm3Q&bvm=bv.134495766,d.amc&cad=rja) giving a quick, condensed mode of what I was talking about and the full quote and link regarding his comparison of the Holocaust with online piracy. Again, I supply this only because his post feels extremely off-putting. I understand not being invited to be part of your previous work, but it's not in good taste to go out and condescendingly call it \"what concert?\" seeing as there are going to be people who will be working really hard on the live performance.\n\n**EDIT 2, Electric Editaloo:** Did some quick google searches of posts I saw over the years in [this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/2s2njf/class_action_lawsuit_against_directsong/) and on the [GW2 subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1uhfka/jeremy_soule_has_made_a_wonderful_soundtrack_for/) about his company, Directsong. (There's another on the GW2 Subreddit, but it's the same as the one in the Skyrim Subreddit.)\n\n**EDIT 3, Edit Harder: The Last Edit:** Looks like my links tripped the spambot and got my comment deleted, but the mods were awesome enough to restore it.

But it depends on the contract they signed with the artist. You can have contracts where you may write/ perform the music for a product, and the music itself belongs to the product owner. Or a contract where they only pay you for writing and performing, but not the rights to the actual music itself.\n\nDunno what Bethesda's agreement is, but if this guy is as jerky as what you made him out to be, then I don't have any doubt that he could well have kept the rights to the music.\n\nIn this case, transcribing from ear is a bit of a gray area in terms of it's legality.

It feels like that's something they'd have for redundancy.\n\nI have some experience of composing game music and I have had indirect contact with Jeremy through my work on the Skywind project. \n\nFirstly, there is no sheet music for Skyrim, except for the male vocals in the main theme. The score is completely synthetic except for those elements. It would be possible to construct sheet music from the midi files but Jeremy will never, ever hand those over. It is equally possible to transcribe the score, which is what has happened with this concert. I've done plenty of professional transcription and Skyrim would be easy to pull down. Obviously, the magic of that score is due to the synth ambiences and huge reverbs which are impossible to reproduce in a live setting. So any live performance won't sound like original score but that's not really why we go to live concerts. \n\nSecondly, Jeremy is a real oddball. Definitely a genius but one of those difficult creative geniuses. He's a perfectionist, he's protective and he has very strong values which he lives by and won't compromise. I have huge respect for his musical output but I'm not convinced by his professional dealings. This is purely my personal opinion and I don't represent anyone or any organisation when I say this. \n\nFinally, from a copyright point of view, it seems clear that Jeremy sold all rights to the soundtrack to Bethesda in what's called a buyout deal. These types of contract command a premium price for the composer. So Bethesda are completely within their rights to pay a transcriptionist/orchestrator to create parts for a live performance. Depending on the deal, Jeremy may get performance royalties collected by the PRS here in the UK. \n\n\nSo overall, while I have some sympathy with Jeremy wanting to be consulted and involved with this recreation of over of his most famous works, its my view that there's nothing he can do and this is a consequence of submitting to a buyout deal. I think it was sensible of Bethesda to negotiate such a deal because if Jeremy doesn't return for the next Elder Scrolls (and I wouldn't be surprised of he doesn't) they can reuse his themes, especially the main theme. \n\n\nFor comparison, a similar situation is the Star Wars theme. Disney can allow McDonald's to use it to advertise chicken nuggets and John Williams can't do anything about that.

I could probably name a few flaws in the skyrim soundtrack without much trouble.\n\nExample: Skyrim, by and large, is a cold, desolate place, this should be represented, musically, compared to the soundtrack, by a greater emphasis on quiet, and lone instruments or sections.  Sounds carried by the wind, not wide orchestral blasts.\n\nSo, yeah, I agree with you, TES music is not memorable, and really shows that the music was put in after, not designed alongside it.", "id": "d89nl8m"}, {"comment": "I really think both the main theme, but also far horizons are great pieces, but apart from that I agree", "id": "d89poi0"}, {"comment": "So is the only TES game you've played Skyrim?

The Song of the Dragonborn is potentially the most powerful TES song ever, and you have a few other gems scattered in there too like [Unbroken Road,](http://youtu.be/EK3q3Jb3TCQ) [Secunda,](http://youtu.be/qC9Ri2hZsos) [Death or Sovngarde,](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNqLyMVaEXA) or [One They Fear.](http://youtu.be/XTUFdPJeukY)\n\nAnd finally you have [The Jerall Mountains,](http://youtu.be/MckCkMPJVpw) and the fact that he chose that as its title exemplifies everything I've been saying. The Jerall Mountains are the range that form a sideways T dividing the provinces of Morrowind, Cyrodiil, and Skyrim. And this is the only song that's appeared across all three games. Jeremy Soule's musical style is the glue that unifies these three drastically different locales. It's what made veteran TES fans fire up Skyrim for the first time and instantly feel like they were home again.\n\nIn terms of Western game composers, I'd say Jeremy Soule easily takes a well-deserved spot in the top 3 alongside Jesper Kyd and Jack Wall for their showings in Assassin's Creed and Mass Effect.", "id": "d8a56of"}, {"comment": "There are other good songs in terms of TES, some of those were listened to before i posted.\n\nLike I said, he's not bad at all, but he's nowhere near the level of [Kyd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6EOW2A6z6I) or [Manswell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txQYTlZFz-M).  Soule makes good music, but he doesn't make good music to fit the game, merely to be laid over it.  \n\nKyd and Manswell also have a much better appreciation of negative space within music.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Deus Ex, and enjoy Michael McCann's music.  I'd still say he's a bit worse than Soule, but at least McCann's music pushes the theme, and the feeling of the game.

Maybe even help them with things, if you wanted. If they had to use the FO4 settlement thing, it could allow you to design your kingdom, or your castle in the very least. It just wouldn't be constantly attacked or anything. (this is, of course, assuming your race even has castles, etc.) \n\nEither way. You do all of these things for a couple of hours...and then you get assassinated. \n\nYou then begin playing as your kid, and the next little while (another hour or so?) is you learning the ropes. Will you use a sword? A bow? 2h? Dual wield? Magic? What kind of Magic? etc. You can learn how to become more charismatic. Maybe learn pickpocketing or lockpicking from the shady folk in the dark alleyway behind the church. Either way, you choose a small set of skills to level up a bit, and then the next part of the game comes. \n\nYou grow up, and eventually your surviving parent passes on, from old age or other natural causes. Nothing nefarious. Thus begins your own coronation. \n\nBut life as a ruler is *boring*. You should be *out there*, you argue, helping the people outside of your kingdom's walls. You should be out exploring, learning new things! You feel that you cannot be an effective ruler if you don't put yourself out there. \n\nAnd so begins your journey. Of course, eventually, you do wind up getting mixed up in crazy shit, but that doesn't happen for a while. Like, halfway through the game or something.

Even the way the camera works makes it look refined and cinematic. In exchange it forces you to play the game the way CDPR wanted you to play it. Even with mods, you don't get to go as crazy as you can in Skyrim.\n\nStorytelling wise, I'd say Witcher 3 trumps ANY of the TES/FO stories easily, not because of the depth but because of the method of delivery. Bethesda games make you feel like the story you're currently playing can be changed on a whim (which is why you try to kill Jarls and shit to see if you can change the storyline). Witcher 3 takes a more linear route wherein there are a few paths you can choose but at the end of the day you KNOW the outcome is something CDPR wanted.

Maybe even help them with things, if you wanted. If they had to use the FO4 settlement thing, it could allow you to design your kingdom, or your castle in the very least. It just wouldn't be constantly attacked or anything. (this is, of course, assuming your race even has castles, etc.) \n\nEither way. You do all of these things for a couple of hours...and then you get assassinated. \n\nYou then begin playing as your kid, and the next little while (another hour or so?) is you learning the ropes. Will you use a sword? A bow? 2h? Dual wield? Magic? What kind of Magic? etc. You can learn how to become more charismatic. Maybe learn pickpocketing or lockpicking from the shady folk in the dark alleyway behind the church. Either way, you choose a small set of skills to level up a bit, and then the next part of the game comes. \n\nYou grow up, and eventually your surviving parent passes on, from old age or other natural causes. Nothing nefarious. Thus begins your own coronation. \n\nBut life as a ruler is *boring*. You should be *out there*, you argue, helping the people outside of your kingdom's walls. You should be out exploring, learning new things! You feel that you cannot be an effective ruler if you don't put yourself out there. \n\nAnd so begins your journey.

How long it takes a player to figure out a puzzle or if they avoided a trap or possibly if the player had to give up.  Of course a nice thing would be to add variables like questing to promote multiple dungeons.  This would be like a scenario mode for the DM where they're given so many tools and the ways to beat them and the more varied or creative they can be with those tools or creatures adds to the experience of the players going into the dungeon.\n\nAnother thing would just be a random load out where dungeons are configured a certain way and you have to come up with the most dangerous or difficult or puzzly way for heroes to get past the traps.  Kinda like an Orcs Must Die or other tower defense games.\n\nAgain, having multiple dungeons connected, like a legend of zelda progression with the tools garnered in each, could be fun.  DMs could go so far as to create their own towns and NPCs too.\n\nThe \"experience point\" aspect just keeps things a little more under control and balanced so you're not seeing too many abuses or impossible dungeon designs.  Sure that lava trap probably makes it difficult, but you're only allowed one per game.  In a way it's a more complex \"Angry Pigs\" game - where you build the contraption to get the eggs, etc.\n\nBut those kinds of things bring up other challenges within the DM's dungeon.  Special secondary quests or ways to avoid enemies through stealth or using the terrain or triggering events (like springing that lava trap on the boss or baddies) would give the hero extra points.\n\nI keep thinking something along the lines of Little Big Planet, meets RPG like Witcher or Skyrim, meets Dungeon Keeper.", "id": "d860pfb"}, {"comment": "The Game i meant is called Guild of Dungeoneering!\n\nEDIT: Why is someone downvoting me giving information to people?

I put the examples up with the hopes people would make up their own minds about that if they did choose to get one. Hope that makes sense.\n\nI think if i go on to make renditions of Morrowind or Cyrodiil i may do it differently, learn from the mistakes.\n\nAs for vector sadly im no good at vector art :( Part of what makes the zoomed in images look \"less than ideal\" is that they are taken at the source projects resolution which is something absurd like 7800x5800.

(EDIT: Or adult mods in general)\n\nI agree there is a lot of (for me personally, ro everyone his own) disgusting stuff in there. However this has the best marriage mods and stuff like LoversComfort that is just amazing.\n\nWalking in on a Questgiver and surprising him and his wife mid act and having to turn down the repeated advances of a male guard (me playing a male character) also can be quite funny and gives some more life to Skyrim.\n\nThe Romantic Adventures mod lets you experience funny weird and partly strange short \"romances\" that are akin to those kitchy books with the half naked men on the cover (just that you are that male guy).\n\nThere is a mod that makes you actually pay attention to your wife/husband because if you don't they will with time look for their satisfaction elsewhere. I once had my in game wife pounce on my character as soon as i entered my house because i was away for so long. Vice versa you making a wife cheat on her husband can cause the husband to charge at and fight you fisticuffs.\n\nSkyrim is so full of violence (wich is totally perfectly fine) wich everyone is okay with and is working to make this even bloodier and more dramatic and what not. So what is wrong with adding some love to the lot.\n\nThat is why i feel those Loverslab mods make the world a little bit more alive and NPCs become more then some lifeless, coldhearted, political correct puppets with just work and murder on their minds.\n\nDon't await much of the animations though. They look like someone is banging plastic puppets together. :-P\n\nEDIT: TL,DR: Are you an adult who enjoys sex?

I waited until the right moment and used console command TFC 1 to freeze frame and toggle free camera\n\n3. I moved my camera around to suit my framing, little understanding of composing tricks like rule of third and golden ratio helped a bit. Use Console FOV to set Field of View (the key here is to eliminate corner distortion). Once I was happy-ish with it, I took a mental note roughly where the camera position was. In my case, I want to show the greybeard HQ in the background.\n\n4. I moved my camera toward the dragon, Clicked on the dragon, Console command TAI to freeze him in place (useful command as it will freeze whatever you need even if you are out of TFC command).\n\n5. I used console command Setscale to scale the dragon or yourself to suit your desire. In this case, I think I slightly enlarged the dragon and scaled my PC down to make the dragon more intimidating.\n\n6. Used TFC 1 command again to get out of free cam.\n\n7. Posed my minion. \n\n8. I entered TFC 1 to freeze frame, Use TAI on myself, TFC 1 again to exit freeze frame, and use TFC 0 this time to access free cam without freezing time I went back to where my camera was located (just roughly for the moment).\n\n9. I killed the dragon using console command KILL while selecting the dragon. Don't worry, the dragon will still hold pose and not turn into skeleton. This is CRUCIAL for reason below\n\n10. Atmosphere and lighting. The best tools to use outdoor are force weather change and setfog console command. You can use whatever is more convenient for you, I personally use the weather command a bit more because I've made bat files for different weathers.\n\n11. I forced riftenfoggy weather, waited for an hour with Wait function (while free cam is still active) -now if I didn't kill the dragon, I couldn't use the wait command- The sky should be all foggy. Good.\n\n12. I forced clearsky via console BUT didn't use wait command this time, wait in real time by exiting console command, You'll see that the fog will gradually move away from the centre, giving clear lighting for the middle object, but still foggy and atmospheric in the background. \n\n13. in this step, we want to pay attention to the fog movement, when I was happy with the clear/fog balance, I entered console command, typed in TFC 0 to exit freecam and immediately used TFC 1 to Froze the scene.\n\n14. I went to my camera position, used Console command TM to hide HUD, adjust the camera, and used whatever the enb assigned screenshot button is. SNAP\n\n15. I used TFC 1 to get out of freecam.

My heroin addiction lasted about 10 years. I lost everything and ended up homeless, sleeping in the woods with another addict. I was arrested several times for possession. I technically died more than once due to overdoses and woke up in the hospital or ambulance after being Narcan'd probably 5-6 different times over the years. (Narcan is NOT a fun experience. It's super painful as it throws your body into immediate withdrawals.) I lost several good jobs at tech companies (I'm a computer tech) and fucked up my college education more than once. I helped save the lives of two of my addict friends that overdosed in front of me. Thankfully, I had Narcan on me and revived them and then brought them to the hospital or called 911. One of them went on to overdose about a year later but didn't have anyone to save him that time :(. I totaled 4 cars because I was either high or sleep deprived (for some reason, I could rarely sleep on any opiates, unless I did enough to lose consciousness aka fall out.) I went to several rehabs and saw every doctor and therapist around. My opiate tolerance was super high and by the end of my addiction, I had blown through about $20K (I had gotten an insurance settlement) in less than 2 months, almost all of it on heroin. I supported my addiction by driving other addicts around, working when I could get a job, selling some of my electronics, and I had a decent savings account my parents had started for me when I was born (that was empty before my addiction ended.) I was told by countless doctors that my addiction was so bad I HAD to be on Methadone. I tried it for a short while and I'll just say my experience with the local Methadone clinics was a joke. I don't know if clinics everywhere operate like the ones in my area but I was shocked at what I saw everyday there. Basically, the vast majority of patients there were on Super high doses for many years and/or still using drugs. Some continued to use heroin but I also saw many people switch to alcohol, benzos, or IVng coke or crack. People were actively selling and using drugs right outside the clinics. Despite continued failed drug tests, no one ever got kicked out, unless they did something extreme like fighting inside the clinic or getting caught smoking crack or shooting up in the bathroom. I left after not too long and eventually went through an awful detox at home that almost killed me. After that, I spent about 6 months in a residential/inpatient program and then moved into a sober house. After, I got on a low dose of Subs but not just because I was an addict. I'm also prescribed it for two \"off label\" health reasons as well. I've been clean for a few years now and I never want to go back. \n\nI have definitely switched my addiction to video games and a little bit of exercise.

I was also addicted to heroin, but it was actually kratom that got my opiate addiction started years ago.  I was into a lot of drugs when I was in college and I came across Kratom.  It helped my focus, anxiety, and sleep, so pretty quickly I began taking it every day.  My grades were way up and I was doing great at work as well, everything was great.  Unfortunately tolerance went up and up and I started having stomach problems from all they nasty dry kratom powder I was ingesting.  I went to NYU, so naturally being in nyc I could get any drugs I could every want.  I started doing blues next (this is back when they were $10 each before the crackdown a few years back, so I could afford it).  Obviously at this point you can see where this is going, but eventually I couldn't get/afford blues anymore, so I tried H and then kept snorting it every day for 2 years... Luckly I never tried shooting up, but 2 years of snorting heroin every single day is still a legit addiction. Finally I said enough is enough and went and got on suboxone, 12mg a day. I've been on subs for 18months now and I am currently tapered all the way down to .5mg a day, planning on making the jump off sometime soon.  I only posted this because there's a ton of people who think kratom is some magical cure for opiate addiction (and it can be a great tool), but it can also be a weak opiate that can start you down the path of addiction just like codeine of vicodin.  Be careful with kratom, if you've got an addictive personality you most certainly can get hooked bad on the shit and have full blown opiate withdrawal symptoms when you try and stop.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, how low did you taper down to before making the jump off of subs?  How bad was it/how long did the physical symptoms and PAWS last?  Thanks man! Keep it up!", "id": "da7ofo0"}, {"comment": "I totally agree about the kratom, but I would prefer that over subs now a days if I had to do it again. \n\nI actually was on 16mg a day and found out that when I turned 26 I couldn't be on my parents insurance anymore so I was cut off as I couldn't afford it. Desperate, I turned to kratom because there was no way I was going back down the path I just came and I was frantic because I knew cutting off at 16mg would be literal hell.  So unfortunately I do not have an answer, but from what I read, it shouldn't be that bad. .5 is nothing and I think it would be mostly mental. How long is your taper? How long are you staying at .5?

Skyrim helped me fail a couple classes.", "id": "da7r2rs"}], [{"comment": "Skyrim and a few other games have definitely helped me stay clean too.\n\nI was addicted to pain pills and then moved to snorting and then shooting dope. My heroin addiction lasted about 10 years. I lost everything and ended up homeless, sleeping in the woods with another addict. I was arrested several times for possession. I technically died more than once due to overdoses and woke up in the hospital or ambulance after being Narcan'd probably 5-6 different times over the years. (Narcan is NOT a fun experience. It's super painful as it throws your body into immediate withdrawals.) I lost several good jobs at tech companies (I'm a computer tech) and fucked up my college education more than once. I helped save the lives of two of my addict friends that overdosed in front of me. Thankfully, I had Narcan on me and revived them and then brought them to the hospital or called 911. One of them went on to overdose about a year later but didn't have anyone to save him that time :(. I totaled 4 cars because I was either high or sleep deprived (for some reason, I could rarely sleep on any opiates, unless I did enough to lose consciousness aka fall out.) I went to several rehabs and saw every doctor and therapist around. My opiate tolerance was super high and by the end of my addiction, I had blown through about $20K (I had gotten an insurance settlement) in less than 2 months, almost all of it on heroin. I supported my addiction by driving other addicts around, working when I could get a job, selling some of my electronics, and I had a decent savings account my parents had started for me when I was born (that was empty before my addiction ended.) I was told by countless doctors that my addiction was so bad I HAD to be on Methadone. I tried it for a short while and I'll just say my experience with the local Methadone clinics was a joke. I don't know if clinics everywhere operate like the ones in my area but I was shocked at what I saw everyday there. Basically, the vast majority of patients there were on Super high doses for many years and/or still using drugs. Some continued to use heroin but I also saw many people switch to alcohol, benzos, or IVng coke or crack. People were actively selling and using drugs right outside the clinics. Despite continued failed drug tests, no one ever got kicked out, unless they did something extreme like fighting inside the clinic or getting caught smoking crack or shooting up in the bathroom. I left after not too long and eventually went through an awful detox at home that almost killed me. After that, I spent about 6 months in a residential/inpatient program and then moved into a sober house. After, I got on a low dose of Subs but not just because I was an addict. I'm also prescribed it for two \"off label\" health reasons as well. I've been clean for a few years now and I never want to go back. \n\nI have definitely switched my addiction to video games and a little bit of exercise. I'm glad to see others who did the same.", "id": "da832nh"}], [{"comment": "Nice, simple, and clean. Looks great!

Do you want modders to make good mods, with large amounts of content and great quality? Pay them. If modders could make a decent income off making mods, then you could expect more frequent bug fixes, tweaks, and updates. If a mod is popular enough, you can expect more from the creator because he can rely on getting money for it. II get that there are a lot of huge mods out there that are great, and are free. But imagine what we'd get if we paid those modders to make even better mods. This could've also been something that could've paved the way for mod support in other games. If devs think they can make keep making money off the games they make by adding mod support, more devs would do that. A few years down the line you'd see more triple A games with mod support. Paid mods was a good idea, steam just didn't present it in the best way, and users were too greedy. It's not like free mods would stop existing. I really hope steam tries this again, but in a more palatable way. I think this is what the modding community needs to evolve.\n\n\nSorry for the rant.

I've come to a few solutions for that, one is a mod that makes zombies serve you with drinks and food as well as other tasks if you equip their corpses with serving gear, the other is simpler, to use teleportation spells to zap myself to a friendly town, use her immense riches from looting dungeons to purchase supplies to keep her alive, then zap herself back.\n\nOr she could become a vampire, which iNeed has a setting for so only sleep will be necessary to survive.

Works well with Live another life. On top of what Live another life gives you, this lets you decide what basic equipment do you want for your early levelling, so while Live another life assumes you're, say, a hunter camping near Helgen, maybe you're actually a necromancer who killed that hunter.\n\n+Death Souls\nI'm a sucker for immortality in Skyrim, but this means I need to balance killing dragons (which I really need a decent difficulty mod for) against learning shouts, because when I hit 0 shouts, boom. I've got another mod somewhere that lets me swap souls for perk points, so it becomes a real thing that I want to kill all the dragons.\n\n+MainMenu\n\nAdds an easy organisation to your saves. If you play between 2 or more alternate characters, this helps A LOT.\n\n+skyBirds - Airborne Perching Birds\n\nRemember what I said about birds? CHEEP CHEEP MOTHER FUCKER\n\n+Alternate Start - Live Another Life\n\nI cannot recommend LAL enough.\n\n+The Paarthurnax Dilemma\n\nThis changes a weird moment towards the end of the main quest to a moment of badassness where the Dragonborn doesn't take any crap.\n\n+Sacrosanct - Vampires of Skyrim\n\nMakes vampires closer to Vampire the Masquerade style vampirism. Honestly not certain if I'm keeping this one.\n\n+NetImmerse Override\n\nProbably was a prerequisite for something.\n\n+XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended\n\nProbably for a sex mod.\n\n+Realistic Ragdolls and Force\n\nPretty much this one stops you from sliding infinitely when ragdolling down mountains, I think.\n\n+BodySlide and Outfit Studio\n\nLets me fiddle with the CBBE body. Not really messed with this much but I should.\n\n+Rumors like in Oblivion\n\nThis bloody mod is the best bloody thing. You know rumours in inns? Now every npc has that as an option. SO MANY RADIANT QUESTS and it feels natural.\n\n+Fores New Idles in Skyrim - FNIS\n\nThis was deffo for a sex mod.\n\n+VS Medieval Sorceress Dress_ Morticia Addams Inspired\n\nYou have no bloody idea how difficult it was to find a dress suitable for a necromancer that was semi Maleficenty. This is the best thing, it's just a shame you can't wear shoes with it.\n\n+Crown Helmets\n\nWant horns, Maleficent style? Want to have a helmet but also show your face? These crowns (and invisi-helmets) are great.\n\n+Aemer&#39;s Refuge\n\nMod I'm trying out, uncertain on it as my game lags like mad. Massive sprawling home that connects each hold and a lot of key locations.\n\n+Dustbound - Fully Voiced Male Follower Companion\n\nI forgot I installed this guy.\n\n+Jenya - Dark Brotherhood Necromancer\n\nOh hey I forgot you existed Jenya I should recruit you one day.\n\n+Grimoire - Spell package\n\nMore magic.\n\n+Oblivion Artifact Pack V5.5\n\ni have yet to find any of these artifacts.\n\n+Wet and Cold\n\nI really should activate this mod. It's in my load order, I think it's what causes the frozen effect on my character, but I really don't want to mess with survival mods until the main quest is over.\n\n+WIC Cloaks NMM\n\n+Cloaks of Skyrim 1-2 Dawnguard\n\n+Cloaks of Skyrim 1-2\n\ncapes.\n\n\n+Ultimate Assortment - Core Files\n\nRandom armour and gear from other bits of fiction. Includes an unenchanted One Ring that's GREAT with an enchantment that makes you invisible sometimes.\n\n+Lind\n\nRobes. I don't typically use these myself but the spellthief gloves are nice and I sometimes make my cult wear this stuff.\n\n+Frostfall 3.2.1\n\nDo you want to freeze to death like a snowman? It doesn't have to be a snowman...\n\n+Bloodmoon Rising - Moonlight Tales Werewolf and Werebear Expansion Pack\n\nIn case I ever go mad and decide to become a werewolf.\n\n+Skip Mage Guild Tour\n\nI have this? huh.\n\n+Skyrim Underground\n\nThis adds tunnels. I think it conflicts with Live another life because the dungeon you start in in Live another life is very transparent before you talk to the statue, but pick any option other than 'i want to break out of here' and never return to that abandoned prison and you should be fine.\n\n+Trade Routes\n\nBehind the scenes stuff. Mostly just makes prices vary from hold to hold and is subtly influenced by your actions.\n\n+Ultimate NPC Face Unlocker\n\nI swear this doesn't work in my game, but should add a load of NPC faces to the presets in character creator.\n\n+INI settings\n+SKSE\n+Crash fixes\n\nstuff\n\n+Possessive Corpses no more lazy zombies and shy nirnroots\n\nTHE MOD FOR NECROMANCERS. Means raising a zombie and the duration ends does not leave you with sad ash piles, just raise the zombie again and again and again!", "id": "davh2az"}, {"comment": "\n\n+Expanded NPC Dialogue\n\nI think this one adds unique silent dialogue to various follower npcs. Very nice, I honestly like the development on Lydia that this mod makes her a former guard who volunteered to be your housecarl, and Sven is looking to escape the podunk town of Riverwood... It's all nice. A nice touch is if you're near a major city you can ask that person 'what do you think of Solitude' or 'what do you think of Markarth' and usually they have a short story about the time they were there.\n\n+WarmongerArmory Leveled List\n\nI honestly forget what this one was.\n\n+Masters of Death - Rise of the Brotherhood\n\nArmour. Looks ok. Wanted to try it with the tribunal masks mod but keep forgetting it exists.\n\n+HDT Bounce and Jiggles UNP\n\num.\n\n+HDT Equipment - Craftable Weapon Sling\n+HDT Physics Extensions\n+Jaxonz Real Names\n\nmod adds names to most generic npcs. Really worth having.\n\n+ASIS\n\nThis really ought to do something to make npcs use health potions and spells more, but I can't see a difference and have yet to work out any special installation stuff.\n\n+Noblesse Oblige\n\nMakes Jarls look a step above gutter trash. Mostly just for Elsif, this mod, but it does stuff for the dude Jarls. Makes em look FANCY!\n\n+Bandolier - Bags and Pouches\n\nUseful mod. Adds a load of accessory items for your followers to properly look like your packmule.\n\n+Dwemer Storage Cube - A Portable Home\n\nAdds a kind of tricked out home... which I honestly forget I have in my inventory.\n\n+Beasts of Tamriel\n\nAdds beasts.\n\n+Goblins in Skyrim\n\nGoblins. They were in Oblivion, I wanted them in Skyrim, found them. I use the Falmer-inspired model since it's closest to the Oblivion Goblins.\n\n+Alchemist's journal\n\nCool mod, even works with mod-added ingredients, keeps track of what has what effect and lists them.\n\n+KenMOD - Lockpick Pro - Cheat\n\nI really cannot be arsed with lockpicking. I'm sorry, but it's the dullest part of the game for me.\n\n+Passive Weapon Enchantment Recharging - Weapons recharge over time\n\nPretty much means you never have to recharge your weapons unless you're fighting huge armies. But also charging your weapons in combat gives you enchanting experience.\n\n+Imperial Fine Clothes\n\nMy citizens need nicer clothes than the common rabble!\n\n+Imperious - Races of Skyrim\n\nMakes racial powers better.\n\n+Sacrificial Maidens - UNP Shift and Bloomers\n\nGotta save them damsels. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THESE LADIES IN MY GAME, buggered if I know where they are.\n\n+Immersive Speechcraft\n\nMore dialogue options, these ones are more generic but also let you threaten people, beg for money, and give gifts to people. I like to offload my junk onto the citizens, which coincidentally tends to leave cities well armed in case vampires come. ;)\n\n+A Matter of Time - A HUD clock widget\n\nI lose track of time IRL. The in-game time is useful but honestly I find the IRL time being in-game lets me control my game sessions a bit.\n\n+People are Strangers\n\nNever see anyone's name til you talk to them.\n\n+I&#39;m a Customer Dammit\n\nLets you order food by looking at it. If, say, the barkeep has buggered off somewhere, you can use this to purchase food without them. Useful with iNeed.\n\n+Cooking Ingredients\n\n+Dovahcook - Cooking Recipes Expansion\n\nBloody insane recipes. I love them.\n\n+Paper World Map\n\nI need to swap this out for that 2d one I think chesko advertised on twitter. This one tends to bug out on me every few sessions.\n\n+Automatic Variants\n\nShould mean in animals it will look for alternate textures in mods I use.\n\n+Genesis - Dynamically Increased Enemy Spawns and Enhanced Loot\n\nWhat this actually does is add hitsponge enemies who die hard who fit in the dungeon here and there, and adds some rare loot. Kind of breaks the flow of some dungeons, sneaky areas suddenly have super-aware zombies about, but eh, I love this for the unpredictability of it.\n\n+The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal\n\nNot yet started this one.\n\n+Undeath\n\nNot yet started this one.\n\n+Map Markers Complete\n\nThis helps me find my way around.\n\n+Alchemists Hidden Valley\n\nI love this for the all-in-one crafting station cauldron near the front door. Everything else is faff, that cauldron is BEAUTFIUL.\n\n+Technicolor Alchemy Overhaul\n\nAdds variants of some ingredients in alt colours that have the same effect. This means you can make a nightshade + yellow nightshade + white nightshade potion for 3x the effect. It's interesting to dabble with this. Doesn't seem to go into the shop lists though, so it's purely what you pick up while you travel.\n\n+Flyable Broomstick\n\nThe best flight mod I've seen period. Basically is a flying horse carefully disguised as a broomstick\n\n+Landlord\n\nIf I ever had the money to buy a business, I'd play about with this one a lot more.\n\n+Craftable Dawnguard Vampire Jewelry\n\nAdds jewelry to the smithy menu from dawnguard.\n\n+Tribunal Robes and Masks\n\nSome really cool if bulky robes, and SPOOKY AS FUCK masks. Really useful if you're making a dark cult.\n\n+Expanded Jewelry Crafting\n\nMore jewelry. They say soul trap enchantment diamonds are a girl's best friend.\n\n+Tentapalooza for Campfire\n\nCampfire is great.\n\n+iNeed - Food, Water and Sleep\n\nSo, the necromancer queen raised her arms, and with an imperious moment of rage... She realised her stomach was grumbling and her armies of dread were laughing at her because she skipped breakfast.\n\n+Freshly Ground\n\nLets you grind up stuff that seems reasonable to grind up.\n\n+Craftable Hearthfire Planters - Campfire addon\n\nI'm not certain but this should let me be able to build a farm, right?\n\n+Campfire Extensions - Bedrolls and Traps\n\nAdds some basics. The bear traps are interesting.\n\n+Lost Grimoire of Skyrim\n\nMore spells.\n\n+Birds of Skyrim\n\nYOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH BIRDS IN MY GAME? GUESS AGAIN!\n\n+SkyUI\n+Animated Prostitution - Skyrim\n\nOk. So I wanted a sex mod, went on Lovers Lab, and it was kind of complicated. I really just wanted something simple that takes under a minute to do, leaves the character with a useful buff. Animated Prostitution on the Nexus is your bare bones basic sex mod. There's ones I want to install, like Defeat, where you can subjugate your enemies or be subjugated to certain indignities, but eh.\n\n+Wearable Lanterns\n\nI usually strap a lantern on Faendal.\n\n+More Dramatic Alduin Retexture\n\nDRAMA ALDUIN ZOOMIN.\n\n\n+ShowRaceMenu Precache Killer\n\nRacemenu crashes a lot for me.\n\n+RaceMenu\n\nYou used to crash a lot for me.\n\n+Garm the Husky Companion\n\nI have never found you in my game but one day you will be mine.\n\n+Loks Eyes Standalone with and without glow\n\nSPOOPY EYES\n\n+Grace Darklings Attire Packs\n\nSo it turns out that I as a 25 year old male really like playing dressup.\n\n+Lind&#39;s Standalone Robes Pack 01\n\nMore robe variants.\n\n+LC_Immersive Looting\n\nAdds treasures. I mainly use these for quick gold right now, but they could be nice for decoration.\n\n+Guard Dialogue Overhaul\n\nMakes guards more respectful.\n\n+Dragon Soul Relinquishment\nLets you turn a dragon soul into a perk point. What this means is I can hold off levelling and just kill dragons to get all the perks in the trees I've reached thus far.\n\n+T3nd0s The Staff Machine\n\nThis should let me make my own staves but I haven't experimented with it much\n\n+Simply Knock SKSE Files\n\nOh no the door is locked.\n\n... Ya ever heard of just knocking on the door?\n\n+Wizard Hats\n\nI can't exactly be a wizard unless I have wizard hats.\n\n+Perfect Legionnaire - Imperial Armor Reforged 6-0\n\nAVE IMPERIUM!\n\n+Extended Stormcloak Armor Variety\n\nNot a big Stormcloak fan, but they need sleeves, dammit.\n\n+Aurora - Standing Stones of Skyrim\n\nChanges the standing stone effects. Kind of rad. Enai makes the best 'power' mods\n\n+Thunderchild - Epic Shouts and Immersion\n\nThis mod. There is something really freaking cool about getting Kynareth's blessing and free new shouts for doing stuff that god likes.\n\n+Wintermyst - Enchantments of Skyrim\n\nMore enchantments. These are mostly all pretty cool. Struggling to get the blink enchantment to work right though, I should be able to teleport but only worked the once.\n\n+Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim\n\nMore spells. Hah. Most importantly though adds 'erase spell' scrolls, meaning I can clean out my spell list of old spells or ones that have been replaced with better ones.\n\n\n+Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim\n\nTHIS BLOODY MOD IS THE BEST. Go Alteration tree, get the perk that gives you limited spell slots per day. Makes things more D&D forever.\n\n+Brawl Bugs Patch - Plugins - Modder Resource\n\nMeans you don't get bounties in fair duels.\n\n+Skyrim - Enhanced Camera\n\nUm... sex mods. First person. Interesiting.\n\n+Simply Knock\n\nKnock knock.\n\n+SOS\n\nDudes gotta have dongs.\n\n+Campfire - Complete Camping System\n\nCampfire is great.\n\n+Extensible Follower Framework\n\nLets you teach your followers spells, and also lets you command them to relax or do stuff EN MASSE!\n\n+Bijin NPCs\n\nI suspect this mod is why Irileth has stupid hair now. Oh well.\n\n+Main Font Replacement\n\nMakes the font less goofy.\n\n+moreHUD\n\nMakes my HUD show useful info, like with alchemy ingredients letting me know their effects if known on sight without going into my inventory.\n\n+Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch\n\nVITAL.\n\n+Acquisitive Soul Gems Multithreaded\n\nNever try to stick a weak rabbit soul in a black soul gem ever again.\n\n*Unmanaged: test\n\nI tried to make a book mod once!

I take that the one guard was on shift for guard duty, and his cousin for a position where he'd likely be fighting dragons.\n\nThe second quote makes even less sense for you saying that they're not good soldiers. If a guard is complaining that there hasn't been a good bandit raid lately, doesn't that mean that either the bandits that have tried to raid were no match for them and/or that that guard is craving combat, which an unskilled soldier would probably rather fear?\n\nAn unskilled soldier would probably be handed a mace and shield, not a random weapon. Mace and shield is a relatively low skill and low risk fighting style, while handing an unskilled soldier a sword is probably just going to get them killed. Swords are not easy to use. Relatively speaking, maces are; and a shield makes that even safer.\n\nIt'd cost less to give soldiers weapons that they're already skilled with rather than train them with *every* kind of weapon", "id": "cz22ynf"}, {"comment": "I live for the in-depth analysis of Skyrim.", "id": "cz3fw8s"}, {"comment": "I keep getting \"Light armor means light on your feet\".", "id": "cz1oouw"}, {"comment": "SMAHT", "id": "cz1ywsn"}, {"comment": "Actually heard this the first time, not long ago, and was utterly confused.", "id": "cz1hphu"}, {"comment": "Or when they say that light armor is smart because light on your feet.

The Skywind team hopes this will also be a 64 bit engine like fallout 4. This will give use more power, better performance, and fix a majority of ram related issues. \n\n(edit)\n Here is a post I made to the Skywind subreddit about the Skyrim SE and where I explain how it effects Skywind.\n\n>Hey guys, Micah ghost here, Landscaper on Skywind. Let me give you a run down on what has been announced and rumors and stuff. Tonight Bethesda not only announced a remastering of skyrim for consoles but also for PC. The remaster will include higher res textures (even higher than the PC HD texture pack) all DLC, better lighting & Shading, and Mod support. Bethesda also announced that all PC users who have all the DLC for skyrim will get a free upgrade. That is very exciting because most people either have them all or have most. At the moment of writing this we do not know if the engine was upgraded to a 64 bit engine like Fallout 4(fallout 4 uses a upgraded version of the skyrim engine),But looking at the high details in the trailer it is most likely a 64-bit engine. This has made some people worry if old mods will work. Yes mods will be able to work without any porting(Pete Hinds confirms it here https://twitter.com/DCDeacon/status/742204161823899648), The only thing that will need porting/updating is SKSE(skryim script extender). SKSE is a special tool that gives creators more freedom with the engine so a upgraded engine would require a new SKSE update. I do not believe it will take long at all,because the same team has already done a script extender for fallout 4(FOSE) which uses a 64 bit engine most likely almost identical to the new engine Skyrim Special edition most likely uses. A 64 bit engine is great new for us. It gives up more power and better stability to make Skywind even better. over the next week we will receive more information about Skyrim SE and we will use this information to decide how we proceed with the project. Nothing is set in stone at the moment this is all very fresh to us. Now on to a Console port. Most of us would love to bring Skywind to console, and they could probably run it fine. The only problem is that consoles mods can not require SKSE since SKSE directly changes the game engine. There is a possibility Bethesda may add SKSE support in the future, but without it there is not way to port Skywind to console. I believe we may in the future try to contact Bethesda and see if we can work this out but it is a very small chance. Overall the prospect of a new engine is very exciting for our team and we cant wait to see what the future holds for Skywind.\n\n"], [441, "What a big sigh of relief.

Playing on expert, I never had enough mana to make it through encounters - and I sank literally all my levels into magic (also had arch-mage robes and most equipment was pretty good +magic or -mana cost stuff), so my mana pool wasn't the problem. \n\nSo you kinda end up having to fight with the most mana-efficient spells, which don't do enough damage, so you end up taking the impact perk to help with that, which ends up making the whole game totally trivial and incredibly boring. Just dual-casted firebolts spaced far enough apart that your enemies stagger and then just start to move again before you hit them again... That way you don't burn through your mana bar too quickly. But even if you do that, tougher enemies will still take more than your whole mana bar to defeat. \n\nSo you need conjuration, that way you have something to deal damage and distract enemies while you're out of mana. But conjuration is expensive, so you run out faster, so a ton of time is spent just hanging out waiting to regen mana while you watch monsters fight each other.\n\nAlternatively, you can just carry a ton of mana potions at all times, in which case mana is entirely removed as a game mechanic because you always have enough. That makes the game boring, because you never have to worry about what you're casting. Or, what I found effective was an absorb magic dagger that I could use while my summons tanked enemies.\n\nOverall, it seems like it'd be the most varied and interesting way to play, but you're so constrained by mana costs that everything becomes very formulaic and you end up using shitty spells even at higher levels. That means that you have a low damage output, which means that you'll have to compensate by cheesing enemies (via impact, which is incredibly OP). Meanwhile, you'll be doing less damage than any other playstyle, and also you'll have sunk all your level-ups into magicka so you have way less health and stamina than other playstyles. \n\nSorryfor the rant, I was really disappointed by my recent mage run because mages are always some of my faves.

It keeps them slow allowing you to just run away from them and continue hitting them with your magic while they can't even get close enough to hit you.\n\nFire will do extra damage to health on top of its original damage.

Shadows that blend and blur correctly the further the source object away is (only game I've seen do that with a setting for it is deus ex mankind divided, it surprised me) would be needed too as shadows get harder the closer they are to the source.\n\nLet's see... you'd need someone with phenomenal post processing control too. And even before that someone with amazing skills in making post processing. That'd make a huge difference (advanced AO, realistic blurs (look at those rocks on the right of the dragonborn, they're a tiny bit blurry aren't they?)).\n\nWe're so close yet so far for graphics like this.

Damage resistance from physical attacks caps at 80% damage reduction. You get 0.12% damage reduction per armor rating, so therefore the cap is 667. You get a hidden +25 armor bonus for each piece of armor you wear, so the effective armor cap for light and heavy is 567. Subtract another 25 if you use a shield.\n\nThe reason it caps is just because Bethesda decided that linear damage resistance was a good idea, and down the line realized how broken the returns got at higher percentages. Basically, in case you don't like math, for every 1 point of armor you get, every subsequent point will have increased value, and this rate increases exponentially. So lets say 500 armor = 100% damage reduction. From 0 to 250 armor, you get 50% reduction with a linear scaling like Skyrim. From 250-375, you get another 50% reduction. From 375 to 437, you get another 50% reduction. From 437 to 468 you get another 50% reduction. There's an obvious trend here. So Bethesda decided to just put a hard cap at 80%, because their game would somehow be even more broken if they didn't. \n\nYou can get mods to change this, all they'll do is touch base armor values or armor damage reduction scaling, which means it'll just be harder to hit the cap.\n\nAlso, in case you're curious, the magic resistance cap is 85%. It's much easier to figure when you're at this cap, since the game displays all magic resistances as straight percentages. Magic resistance stacks multiplicatively with specific type resists, as in 50% magic + 50% lightning = 75% lightning resistance, I think.

If you're holding a bow you dont need to notch an arrow, youll be able to apply it before drawing an arrow back (so that you dont have to worry about opening a menu with an arrow ready). If you're dual-wielding it will only apply poison to the weapon in your right hand IIRC.\n\nAlso IIRC you can also apply poisons to summoned weapons (Bound Sword/Bound Bow, etc).\n\nThis is where Alchemy can be super helpful because you can eventually create super potent poisons that can even one-hit dragons.\n\nEdit: also if you are applying poison to a bow the game will prompt you asking if you want to apply a poison to the bow itself, not the arrows.

I'm saving this for later and hoping it's on Xbox.\n\nEdit: Mod List\n\nMods. Here's my list to make this playthrough a more unique and interesting experience. I haven't played the game in a couple of years and I wanted the game to be more realistic. I'm also roleplaying as a hunter who saw a dragon and needed to tell someone. *Note: These are combat/gameplay mods for Xbox One.*\n\n[Alternate Start](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2918744) - I started off as a camper outside Helgen and the rest is history in the making.\n\n[Frostfall](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2952001) -  So good. You know what it does.\n\n[Campfire](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2941311) - Having a backpack is so cool with all the stuff hanging off of it.\n\n[Hunter's Reward](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2988819) - Small mod that gives better prices for antlers, tusks and some other things. Not really that noticeable.\n\n[Balanced Weights](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3005320) - Makes armor, ingots, etc. heavier.\n\n[Pack Light](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2966758) - Makes carry weight about half of vanilla.\n\n[Longer Days: Realistic Time Scale & Fast Travel.](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2970226) - Exactly what it says.\n\n[iNeed - Food Water & Sleep](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2970856) - A fun mod that gives me an excuse to cook and eat food.\n\n[Populated Places](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2994823) - Tonycubed2 has made quite a few of these mods and even though they can be quite unrealistic (how many bandits does it *really* take to hold a fort?) it makes the game more challenging. I've only linked one of his mods. I think he has three.\n\n[Marco's Integrated Leveled Lists](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2906172) - Adds enemies and creatures from Dawnguard and Dragonborn to the wilds of Skyrim. I keep seeing Werewolves in the Rift and it's terrifying how fast they move.\n\n[Combat Reborn](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3083030) - Adds cool new enemies.\n\n[Better Combat AI](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3059889) - It helps.\n\n[Vigor - Combat and Injuries](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3005320) - Makes combat more challenging. Limbs can break, which cause negative effects.\n\n[True Storms](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3023858) - Adds crazy weather. Works with...\n\n[Supreme and Volumetric Fog](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3023858) - More Fog. Duh.\n\n[Wet & Cold](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2965338) - Visual weather effects on characters. Blizzard Blind sucks but adds to immersion. In the early game I was at Bleakfalls Barrow in the middle of a blizzard. I couldn't move or see and my health and stamina weren't regenerating. Fighting a couple of bandits got a whole lot harder in that instance.\n\n[Everything by EnaiSiaion](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/2988366) - Wildcat and Ordinator are his most well-known mods. The guy does great work and all of his mods are fantastic and are meant to be played together. I'm pretty sure it's thanks to Wildcat, but I play on legendary and nearly everything will die in 1-5 hits, which in my opinion, is more realistic and exciting than having everyone be a tank or super OP. \n\nThese plus a big chunk of other mods have made this playthrough as exciting as playing for the first time. Occasionally the game will crash but I've been overall pretty lucky with compatibility. I don't know much about modding other than the fact that load order determines which files get overwritten but so far everything seems to work great! Then again, some might be disabled and I'm not noticing.\n\nIf you have any other mod recommendations let me know!", "id": "daj64k4"}, {"comment": "> Balanced Weights - Makes armor, ingots, etc. heavier.\n\n> Pack Light - Makes carry weight about half of vanilla. \n\n...Jesus christ, why?

I feel so smart for timing my attacks, learning to side step, judging the distance of my enemies' swings. On the other hand, I just get BRUTALIZED if I miss with that set up.

Recently started playing with these on Legendary. It is such a fun experience. Everyone is so fragile. Heavy armor might survive 2-3 hits. Light armor, one shot.

You swing from the bottoms of your feet to the tip of your blade. Yes, there is *some* variance in where you land your swing, but not as much as leeway as in Skyrim.

When you swing a weapon, this mod makes it so that you only swing where you originally intended. \n\nThis also functions for npcs, so those slow ass overhead two handed power attacks don't home in on you like a guided missile with a nuclear warhead.

In games where the AI has equal mechanics, like in Super Smash Brothers, better AI approximates higher player skill and is the best way to impose difficulty levels. In a fighting game, adding mechanical advantages to the AI-controlled fighter such as added health or damage, feels cheap.\n\nA really pure example of the above is the difficulty setting in a Chess game. Obviously, you can't muck around and give the AI two queens at the start, so your only option is to make the AI smarter. \n\nIn some games with parallel player and AI abilities, the ideal difficulty option might include mechanical advantages. An example of this would be in Civ or Starcraft. Even if we had a perfect AI, it's possible that a cheating AI could give the player more interesting/challenging scenarios compared to a simulated against-a-human experience. I can't give specific example of where this might be the case without diving deep into the mechanics of a specific game, which is outside of the scope of this comment. \n\nThe third scenario is a game where there is no parallel between player and AI. Examples in this category are Zelda or Dark Souls*. In many scenarios in these types of games, the AI is already optimized for the scenario, and it might be past diminishing returns to invest more time into the decision-making of a skeleton in an empty room. In these types of games, increasing the health/damage of mobs does increase the difficulty of the game by decreasing the tolerance for mistakes. A better solution might be to decrease the number of health pickups, which some games do on hard mode. \n\nAnother option in this third category is to make scenario changes. This can include changes to the world, adding/moving/swapping enemies, and introducing new gameplay mechanics (such as tracking exhaustion on high difficulties only). This option is the most costly, since it involves heavy adjustments compared to scaling a couple of stats, but we are discussing a perfect world.\n\nDiscussing Skyrim specifically, I think they handle difficulty scaling exceptionally poorly. In my experience with the game, the higher health of the enemies adds tedium to combat rather than reducing the tolerance for error in any satisfying way. The best solution would be scenario changes as I mentioned above, but that's not realistic. ", "id": "dajg7bb"}, {"comment": "There's one mod out for PC which simply changes the multiplier values of Legendary difficulty. On vanilla Legendary it's something like you take 3x damage and give out 0.25x damage, but this mod just changes it to 3x both ways. So you still take huge damage from enemies, but they aren't sponges so it's still somewhat reasonable.\n\nThat being said, I dunno if the mod exists for consoles.

I proceeded to go to Solitude, summon all of them on a wall so no one could reach them easily and just shot a random guard...\n\n5 minutes later there were HUNDREDS of deadra minions that I was constantly buffing up with all sorts of bound weapons and alteration buffs.
