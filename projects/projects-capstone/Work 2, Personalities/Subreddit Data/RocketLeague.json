Secondly, replace it with something that you don't want to hear about every day. Say... Archaeology. Then, think about how an average day would pan out.\n\n>So, you awaken to the clock radio. It's 7AM. Just as you awaken, it's time for the news and archaeology already. Not news and other historical investigations, like library restorations or museum openings (unless there's another event happening), but just the news and archaelogy. Malaysian plane is still missing. Pistorius is still on trial. New dig announced in Giza. Ancient Mayan temple discovered. Exciting stuff.\n\n>Time for a bite to eat over the morning TV. More news. More archaeology. Yes, you are aware of what is up with the missing plane. Fine. Now the archaeology in video format. Video of people dusting off some skulls and bits of pottery. All well and good, but archaeology isn't your thing. It would be nice to hear about something else. Even when it isn't archaeology season, the media follow noted archaeologists. They drive fast cars, have sex with beautiful women, advertise fragrances, and sometimes they go to nightclubs and act in the worst possible way. Scandals erupt as the tabloids follow these new celebrities when they're not searching the past for answers. It is entirely possible you can recite the names of certain researchers, even if you don't pay attention to archaeology. You don't know what transfer season is, but you know that someone was transferred to a dig in Peru for a sum of money that could fund the London Underground for two whole days.\n\n>Out of the car at 8:55 and into work. What are the colleagues talking about, I wonder? Oh, Jones dropped a 3,890 year old pot and smashed it? What a useless wanker! Someone should do something unpleasant to him. And don't even ask about the unfortunate incident in Athens two years ago - you'll be there all day! Breaking a pillar like that! We don't talk about that here, mate. What? You don't want to discuss the finer points of the prevalence of phallic imagery in Pompeii? Is there something wrong with you?\n\n>The drive home from work. Every thirty minutes, no matter the station, someone mentions the archaeology. Best sit in silence. Drive past a huge billboard with a black and white picture of a rakishly handsome archaeologist draped over an impossibly beautiful woman. He's winking at you. Trowel in his left hand, supermodel in the right. Jurassic, by Calvin Klein.\n\n>And now the pub. A nice pub with a beer garden. Posters in the windows. LIVE EXCAVATION AT THE VALLEY OF THE KINGS! All of it on a huge TV with the volume up too loud. Drunken people yelling at the screen. \"SEND IT FOR CARBON DATING, YOU USELESS CUNT!\" \"WHAT ARE YOU ON, MATE? DUST THE ANCIENT MEDALLION GENTLY! SMELTING METHODS OF THE TIME PRODUCED VERY SOFT AND IMPURE METALS EASILY PRONE TO DISFIGURATION!\" All this from two men out of a crowd of twenty. One lousy drunken idiot and his chum ruin the image of other archaeology fans. Carbon dating report from the lab updates on TV, read by a man employed because they've been following the beautiful science since they were a boy. The drunk chimes in again. \"WHAT PHARAOH'S REIGN DID YOU SAY? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT THE UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR THEORY OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF 4TH BC EGYPT?

Thing is, GPU isn't technically the same thing as the full graphics card, a full card includes the board the chip is soldered to as well as the VRAM and other stuff. Desktop graphics cards are *way* too huge to put in a laptop, and what's in a laptop can't be removed from the laptop's motherboard (whereas desktop cards connect through PCI). It's still arguably a good thing that mobile and desktop GPUs are no longer different since it means things are more standardized for proper optimization and driver support (they'll still always perform differently due to different power consumption and cooling requirements), but it makes no difference in terms of being able to upgrade your laptop's processing capability.\n\nTechnically, I believe DirectX 10 (or maybe it was some aspect of nVidia or AMD's most recent architectures?) allows for graphics cards connecting to laptops in some way, but I don't know if that's actually useable at this point and it'd be pretty cumbersome regardless. Don't really know the details on this so can't comment there beyond the fact that I've heard of the tech being there now.\n\nSo, basically, if you want the actual upgradability that's a big plus for PC gaming, you need a desktop.

A certain small dog feasts on hotdog patties for the rest of its unnatural, eternal endurance. Your constant disapproval sends silence through everything. A contrived beast becomes omnipotent. You ask for a hotdog. I give you a hotdog your body becomes an unsettled blob of nothingness, then divides by three. The papillon barks. The universe realigns itself. You, the papillon, and the hotdog disapprove. This condemnation stops the realignment. Hades freezes over.

But I can see where you're coming from.", "id": "d71duhq"}, {"comment": "Here are a few points I find reasonable to not include Neo Tokyo in the competitive map rotation. I'm not fuming mad, I just think these are reasonable points:\n\n1) Neo Tokyo's ramps can be line-of-sight blockers between players. If you're approaching a ball on the ramp from the ground, you can't see players on top. Players should be rewarded for noticing where other players are. Mechanics that prevent sight are counter-productive. See: all team field sports. It could almost be considered a \"randomizing\" factor - but let's not bother getting into that, there are better points to make.\n\n2) Neo Tokyo's shape funnels the ball towards the nets. The side ramps cause bounces that center the ball towards the net. Also, the curvature of the side walls causes nearly every shot in the corner to roll towards the net.\n\n2. a) The back walls outwards angle causes shots that rolls around corners to be lifted *off the ground* and approach the net above single jump distance. In other maps, a light pass around the corner doesn't gain height, and it's easy to stop. If you want to make a pass that's hard to stop you need to aim your corner shot properly. Neo Tokyo just does this for you.\n\n3) The outwards angle of the back wall makes missed shots more forgiving. A shot at the back wall is deflected slightly upwards and less backwards than on another map with vertical walls. The ball doesn't bounce as far back out of the offensive zone, and stays in the air longer. This is a distinct advantage for the offensive team because:\n\na) There is more time for aerial shots (debateable if that's an advantage); and\n\nb) It is more difficult to clear the ball over the offensive players since it doesn't bounce as far back.\n\n4) The ramps create a smaller center-field for dribbling play. There is less room for deking opponents, making it easier to stop even well practiced players.\n\n5/General point related to all other points) Blindly hitting the ball (a.k.a. ballchasing) is less punishing on this map than standard maps. A blind hit in the forward direction is more likely to center than on standard maps. A blind hit in a sideways direction is more likely to take huge air off a ramp. This gives the shooting player much more time to get back into position, while the opponent(s) have to wait for the ball to fall lower.\n\n6/non-important personal grief) Flashing lights and colours everywhere. It's pretty but distracting and I find I miss the ball more often. \n\nQuick summary of the effects:\n\n* Good corner shots are less important because your bad opponent can do the same without effort. \n\n* Good clears are less important because just about any clear will find it's way to the center.\n\n* Clears in general are more difficult because shapes of the back walls and corners reduce outward bounce distances.\n\n* Map vision and awareness is slightly less valuable since there will times the opponent is on a ledge and out of sight.\n\n* Ball chasing is slightly more effective due to easier centering\n\n* Ball chasing is slightly less punishing since there is increased airtime of ball off ramps - more time for an out of position player to get back in position.\n\nEvery single one of these effects is something that helps tilt the advantage back towards a \"worse\" player.\n\nA matchup that I'd lose 80% of the time on a standard map, I may only lose 60-70% of the time on Neo Tokyo. That's not very fair to the better player.\nRocket League doesn't need mechanics that level the playing field (haha - Neo Tokyo isn't level), that's the purpose of the ranking system.\n\nA solution: an easy map vetos choice in the settings. Give players 1-3 map vetoes they can use so that they don't have to play on certain maps in ranked (some may veto the bright or dark maps too). Starcraft 2 does the exact same thing. Players get to veto up to 3 maps in the current map pool each season. ", "id": "d71wb7k"}, {"comment": "The height of the side sections is the same height as a double jump. So if you boost at the side ramp, jump then double jump (not flipping forward) you will be pretty much flat on that side section.", "id": "d71xlef"}, {"comment": "Yep.  It is just that simple.  My whole play on Neo-Tokyo totally changed when I learned that.", "id": "d76m6tf"}, {"comment": "Just because the map is hard to drive around does not mean you have less control. You have exactly the same amount of control. \n\nI think it's a great idea to have variety in competitive maps, it raises the skill ceiling significantly. Look at csgo. The variety in the map pool lends to more interesting play, with certain teams or players having better strategies or knowledge of the map.  \n\nBut then again these are all just opinions.

I am used to play mostly with players who make very very few mistakes and play fast. Means: Nearly every action has a reason. And when someone doesn't boost to get to the ball, or just is slow, I will take the ball, easy as that. For the simple reason that I am used to players who are only slow when they have a reason to be slow. And when there is no reason to be slow in the situation I automatically assume that the reason they are slow is because they don't want to go up, have no boost etc.\n\nI know that this often happens because the lower ranked player not have the (mechanical) skill to play fast or go for aerials while being supersonic yet , but that is just the mentality I learned (of course when I see them already flying up slowly I won't jump and also go for it because it is obvious that he trys to hit the ball).

I'd guess I'm pretty darn average.\n\nOnce you start getting up into the areas where you're playing with people who have some level of experience in the game, positioning actually becomes a lot easier because you have a general sense of where the ball is going to go. Instead of playing against 80 or 90% of the field, there are only a few smart moves when a ball is in a certain position, so you're setting up to make a play against those smart moves. Additionally, you're better at judging where the ball will go when someone is driving a certain way, so you can start to anticipate where the ball is going to go based on the player's movement. \n\nSo it's not so much that I plan everything out when I play (and oftentimes, I screw up what I'm trying to do, so it winds up not working) but rather that I can look at the ball, my teammates and my opponents and figure out that the best play is going to be doing [whatever]. Usually, when I touch the ball, except for situations where I'm in good scoring positions (mostly, right in front of the net or with nobody on the other team in a defensible position) I'm not even trying to score. I'm just trying to move the ball into a position where we're more likely to score.\n\nSometimes, things open up, and that's where you have to be able to improvise and create opportunities based on openings that aren't obvious right away (this is something I'm bad at), but when people are playing smart, it's more that you can watch the game unfold and know where people are going than having everything planned out.", "id": "d5b21ot"}, {"comment": "Don't listen to this time vampire.

I'm not trying to be rude, but I guess I always assumed that players in higher ranks had a good grasp on the mechanics of the game. \n\nIn the gif you can see the initial player go for the ball then intentionally miss and turn to the right. The other team doesn't plan for a shot because the kickoff was faked. If you know what you're doing, you know that unless you somehow magically have an open shot during a kickoff, you need to flip into the ball. By flipping into the ball you are keeping it on the ground unless you pinch it between you and another teammate. So by going for the kickoff then swerving away from it, OP is essentially forcing the other guy taking the face off to flip into the ball since he believes it is the only way he can win it. Flipping into it keeps it on the ground. \n\nThe only variable that will go awry more than others is the direction the ball goes in. In other words, it isn't a smart idea to do this kickoff if you start diagonally facing the ball, it's best to do this when all three players start in the center, with two slightly forward and to the sides to ensure that the ball will roll straight down the middle towards the goalie/defender when you fake the kick off. After this step it's all about making good passes, and you're in. \n\nI really wasn't trying to be rude with my initial statement. Maybe I should just play ranked more. I've only ever made it to rising star but that was after maybe two or three weeks of playing ranked once season two started (I'm not saying I only played for three weeks lol I have played since December) then I just tried to practice my mechanical play in unranked. \n\nDefinitely think I can make it to at least superstar this season, though. Just haven't really tried.", "id": "d5h0fan"}, {"comment": "From what it looks like, the opponent front flips assuming he's going to do the same so the ball just rolls forward, which gives the person waiting an easy pass to the guy on the right for another easy pass to shot.

Even if it does come off differently, then the last man back just hits it away and the other 2 rotate back and it's no problem really.\n\nAnd yeah the defense on this shot wasn't very good like I mention in a comment above. They went for a cheat kick off so the front 2 players weren't back in time to do anything and the 3rd man went to the corner but turned back before getting the boost so he wasn't sure how to defend.\n\nBut if Flipside can pull it off in RLCS then I'm sure that they would be able to in one of those \"highest ranks\" like where you are :)", "id": "d5gyqnn"}]]], "4zu9of": ["Master of Disguise", "2016-08-27 17:44:40", 10667, "http://gfycat.com/FlimsyHiddenCygnet", [[505, "Whaha, nice one.\n\nWould love to see the point of view from Aevics."], [285, "[Orange car's reaction](http://i.imgur.com/M4vuO.gif)"], [126, "http://i.imgur.com/fuRGIGv.jpg\n\nEdit: I can't take credit for this tasty meme, stole it from the thumbnail of [this guy's video.](https://youtu.be/tYPFOVKh3t0)"], [88, "Not turtlely enough for the turtle club though"], [52, "That was one of the most entertaining rocket League moments I've ever seen haha."], [33, "Impersonating an Orange player? \n\nThat's brilliant!"], [27, "\"You thought it was Red, but it was really me, Blue!"], [25, "Ahh, very nice.

", "id": "d4surea"}, {"comment": "Yes, that's correct. Ball cam has caused me some embarrassing misses at times.", "id": "d4sv8sq"}, {"comment": "Correct. So when you put the stick left and then double jump, you car will always jump to its left.\n\nThis means that even if you're driving towards the camera (eg. You're in ball cam and driving away from the ball so the cam is aimed behind you), and you double jump left (aim stick left + double jump) your car will actually jump to the *right* of the screen.

This explanation requires a little vector math savvy, but I'll try to explain it in lay terms.\n\nYour car has 3 axes - forward/back, up/down, left/right.\nSomersaults, Backflips, and Barrel Rolls in Rocket League always happen horizontally. You can prove this to yourself by jumping off the wall, point your car downwards, wait until you've gained some speed and are close to the ground, and try to somersault. Lo and behold, your car will not somersault downwards into the ground, but actually cancel its vertical momentum and move horizontally.\n\nSo how does it pick directions? I obviously don't know how the code works, but the end result is that it projects your axes into the horizontal plane, and then assumes your \"up\" is pointing up from that plane, and your \"right\" is obviously just to the right of your forward vector in that plane.\n\nThis is why when your car is vertical, it is very hard to predict where your barrel rolls will move. Slightly forward from vertical and you'll move one way, slightly backward from vertical and you'll move the other way.\n\nThis is also why, if you jump in the air and barrel roll you'll move one way. If you jump in the air, use \"x\" or bumper if you've mapped it to roll 180 degrees, and barrel roll, you'll move the same way (even though your car's left / right are reversed).\n\nAll in all I don't 100% like the mechanics because they're physically counter-intuitive, at least for me, but they are certainly interesting and provide a lot of nuance to higher-level mechanical skill", "id": "d4ta35p"}, {"comment": "You're right, I should note that walls are an exception.

When you're learning to type, your teacher explains that you should really learn the \"home row keys\" method rather than the \"hunt and peck\" method. \n\nThe problem is that it's tempting to do the hunt-and-peck. The home row method kinda sucks at first...you make a lot of errors, you type super slow, and you wonder if it's possible to figure out. Hunt and peck is pretty easy since you're looking at the keyboard and seeing the key you're pressing. \n\nNow eventually you can type pretty fast with hunt and peck, for sure. You start to get a feel for things and do well. But you'll never type at 125 WPM with very little errors. But you can accomplish that with the home row keys method, if you deal with the initial awkwardness at the start. \n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nTL:DR you should really just go for it and force yourself to work totally in ball cam and get acquainted.

For example it can roll the ball up the wall and start you facing the wall in order to practice air dribbling off the wall.  It is perfect for training those things that are too risky to try in games.  Personally when I started to use rl trainer even just the types of shots it comes with woke me up to some new things I need to train.\n\nStuxi's shot pack I referenced has a lot of different shots beyond the defaults that come with the trainer.

If there's a dude sitting in the goal, I will crash the goal. If no one is in goal, I will defer to whomever's filling the role of striker, and either stay on the wing or go back on defense, depending on where the 3rd teammate is posted (examples: if both of them are going for the goal, I turbo back to the mid-side boost pod and then post up on the midfield line; if the 3rd guy is already at midfield, I will either crash the goal or get in position for a rebound, hockey-style).\n\nAnd I think by the game's standards, an aerial is anything higher than the highest a boostless double-jump will take you, so I usually  go by that law when talking about the game. It's not always about being 20 feet above the goal, but the higher you hit the ball = the greater the chance you'll be the one who hits it first. \n\nSide flipping is okay if it's an empty net goal, but usually you're just getting in the way of the striker in that scoring chance.\n\nI've found that I generate way more wins when I play, if I use known soccer strategies. Midfield/defense/goalie hybrid, a striker, and a wingman. If you stick to the sides and the corners, and you know without looking that your other teammates are where they're gonna be, it's a lot easier to practice good teamwork.\n\nFor instance, if I'm in a striker role, I will hesitate to crash the net looking for a score if I don't trust that one of the other guys has my back on defense. If I'm going in for a score and a couple of boneheads on my team are both trying to as well, my typical response is \"Dammit!\" and then I turn around to go get on defense.

Almost never drive straight at the hoop, at least at the beginning. Only if the ball is already bouncing on the court should you think about trying to hop it straight in, in my mind. The thing I had to practice a lot of was how hard to bounce into the already airborne ball to get it roughly where I wanted it to go, once you line up the ball and the basket. Aerial practice is really good for this because the ball will be in the air to begin with. I just love when I see that I'll arrive at a ball's contact point with the floor just before it, and knowing I'll be able to just jump a tiny bit after slowing down just right for it to float right in.

It is not required for the game to be published as it is already published and fonctionnal. It's something that would be *nice* to have, but it's not an absolute necessity.\n\nIn other words, this isn't about what would be nice to have or what we would like to have. We need to take in the concept of development value and difficulty. Value is basically how much the client (or developper) values a feature, and difficulty is how hard it is to add it, and the two are added together to make priorities.\n\nMust-Have feature that is easy to make? Lots of value per effort, top priority. Must-have feature that is hard to make (i.e., new content mandated by the contract) Medium to high priority.\n\nUnnecessary feature that is hard to make and is not necessary for the game to function? (in this context, a pc exclusive skin) Very low priority, because we get not much value for lots of effort.\n\nI know this sounds all very technical and methodical, but that's the normal way of operating when working for a client with a deadline. In the context of publishing a port of the game with the approval of a publisher, the developers are indeed in this situation of value vs effort.

Therefore, the less you play at that level, the more you play at your level and not adopt novice habits.

I'm All-star in the two standard modes and one thing to keep in mind is that your MMR at Superstar puts you at the top 1.5% of the world...so think of it less like \"how can I reach x rank\" and more like \"how do I become one of the best players in the region\" and it becomes a little more realistic as to why you struggle hitting a certain level. At superstar, you're pretty much looking at maybe 50,000 players who are better than you are in a given region. For a game that hosts over 12 million players, that's pretty good company. (In all actuality, the number of people with \"higher\" MMR than you is most likely much lower as most people who play only do so casually, so you could say that you're in the top 8,000-10,000 players in a given region.)\n\nIn given modes though, the number is much lower.

Right where it goes slow motion, the camera also zooms in to the action behind you.  While zooming in, the camera also pulls back physically to exaggerate the effect, which has the side effect of making close things get further away while far things get closer.\n\nLike [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNO3BtNT9bY) (except imagine that the focus is in the background, not foreground)\nSearch for Dolly Zoom examples to see more. Works for virtual cameras just as well as physical and the effect can be subtle or greatly exaggerated like in you RL clip :)\n\nFrom LieAlgebraCow:\n>That's actually amazing. If you watch the rotation of the car in both, it matches just after the \"collision\", meaning there probably couldn't have been an actual collision. The extent and perfect timing makes it very convincing.\n\nThere are lots of little clues like this that help prove it. Like near the end, OPs car promptly vanishes to the left as if it changed direction again, but it's actually just that the camera at this very moment finished the dolly zoom and resumes physically tracking the action by moving forward again.

What resulted was people modifying their controllers by cutting out the area around the stick. Since you moved based on the stick, you could move almost twice as fast as everyone else, and have much more contol over movement. Eventually to compete at the top level, you had to mod a controller.

Now if instead of being limited by a circle your stick was limited by a square, you could still only move r amount horizontally or vertically, but you could move r\u221a2 diagonally, giving you an advantage of r\u221a2-r over someone's whose stick is limited by a circle.\n\nOn the video, he jumps and immediately keeps the stick on the edge of movement until he lands. Notice how when he does vertical or horizontal movements both cars land exactly in the same manner, but when moving the stick diagonally the car with the DS3 (or steam controller set to square) moves faster than the car with the DS4, therefore landing differently.

I didn't say they were always guaranteed, just that they *can* be ;)\n\nPositioning for a boxing glove goal just means getting in front of their net with the ball there, and it'll pull a 100kmph+ 90 degree turn.  The defensive window is literally in between where the ball is not otherwise going and the net...  The people who are tooling me with the grappling hook use it *right* before they hit the ball anyways, meaning the defence can't even see it's happening and (again), it comes at 100kmph+ in a specific direction, with a defensive window of being where the ball isn't going otherwise.  And while spikes can mostly be stopped in open play, all of those defenses get destroyed by a talented arialist who doesn't give bump opportunities and lines up the shot so that freeze or teleport just mean the ball goes in without being on spikes...  Defensive play also suffers when a low momentum defense meets someone with high momentum full-out boosting with the ball positioned on their front... Not to mention cherry picking with spikes where you've got less than 2 seconds before the goal hits.\n\nI'm not saying it's impossible to stop anything from those powerup.

The concept of \"skill\" is yet another excuse to add fictional rules and avoid making the best moves. Curiously, scrubs often talk about how they have skill whereas other players\u2014very much including the ones who beat them flat out\u2014do not have skill. This might be some sort of ego defense mechanism where people define \"skill\" as whatever subset of the game they're good at and then elevate that above actually trying to win.\n\n> For example, in Street Fighter scrubs often cling to combos as a measure of skill. A combo is sequence of moves that are unblockable if the first move hits. Combos can be very elaborate and very difficult to pull off. A scrub might be very good at performing difficult combos, but not good at actually winning.

Change the resolution of the game, almost every game let's you do that. \n\nFor example I used to play Rocket League on 1080p, with about 35-45 FPS. A while ago I changed to 720p and now I have about 45-55 FPS. The visual change at first is pretty noticeable, but after a while you get used to it.\n\n**Note**:the good thing about this tips, it is all done with in-game settings, so everything should be ok and easy to undo, but if you want to get some serious FPS boost, you could edit some game files manually, giving you even better FPS, but at the cost of much more noticeable visual changes, and a chance to fuck up your game. I used to do this when I played TF2 with a pretty shitty desktop potato. I got excellent results, at the cost of some considerable downgrade on the graphics, but sometimes my game randomly closed or fucked up, so it wasn't very reliable. Also after every update the game had a chance to not run at all, or erase all the changes I made. So if you plan to do this, you should ask someone who knows about this, don't go just erasing stuff on random files.

It's not vastly. Maybe moderate, but vast is just exaggerating.

Ever since the update in Season 2 that changed the car's Turning Radius, turning radius has such minor differences that it no longer matters to any significant or moderate degree. It's almost near negligible.\n\nAnd the hitboxes don't have an advantage, because it's just what your brain perceives the best. For example, it doesn't matter that the Octane has a taller hitbox, but when I can't imagine the front corner of the car with ease for aerial power hits, it's a problem. So that is why I use a car like the Breakout, where that corner my brain visualizes the best.", "id": "d3zdl12"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d3zetnd"}, {"comment": ">certain cars chip it with not enough power to take a effective shot without jumping just as you hit the ball.\n\nThis is misinformation. All cars can hit the ball at the same power. Power doesn't rely on hitbox shape. It relies on just hitting the bumper, as the bumper has the highest bounciness compared to all other parts of the car. Jumping just as you hit the does nothing besides maybe getting extra height on the ball if you do it correctly. But this is only because you momentum goes from forward, to diagonally forward and up.\n\n>That is a big difference because it requires different mechanics depending on the car\n\nWhile this can change from car to car of getting a certain lob one must need in order to get a specific pass or self-served wall rebound, this would be at the top level of play, which players would know most if not all cars subconsciously by now. Any players below it doesn't matter at all because they lack the mechanical skill and just overall experience to do it consistently, read the rebound, read their teammate, use momentum to their best advantage for these shots and passing, and just in general positioning.\n\n>Certain cars chip it at the top of the net, certain cars chip it just over,\n\nWhich is a proven moderate difference. It doesn't change the lob from dead center crossbar to hitting the curve on the roof intersecting with the wall above the goal. It's literally just a car's lengths to three car's lengths difference, which is not very much at all in the grand scheme of things.\n\n&nbsp;\n___  \n&nbsp;\n\n**Conclusion:** Choice of car is negligible, because anyone below the top field of play, which is almost everyone, lacks the overall skill for it to make any real difference in their gameplay.

I intended \"most of the player base lacks the overall skill necessary to pay attention to the car differences\". This applies to Rising Star/Shooting Star, where players still shoot the ball at the wall and ***wait*** to react to said rebound. And arguably, Shooting Star is still quite high in skill. These players are still slow at momentum, thus the turning radius argument doesn't work anyway if the player keeps making mistakes on how to control said car's transfer of momentum from place to place. \n\nAllstar is where it begins to matter, but it's almost near negligible. This is because Allstar skilled players are learning how to be faster and use prediction more, which means things like direct passing plays/rebounds are coming into play. These things require near perfect precision on their hits in order to do correctly. \n\n>If you don't pay attention to the differences you have a serious disadvantage. \n\nNo, you don't have a disadvantage.

All cars require this at some point. The points in time where other cars do require it, and some do not, are not severe or drastic enough to make points about it. Because either the player lacks the precision aim to do so (which is basically anything below low Superstar), or they already know all cars by then.\n\n>It is not misinformation. The power thing was bad phrasing, I just meant the angle is shitty not that it has less kinetic energy.\n\nPower isn't anything close to \"shitty angles\". Power is strength, which equates to velocity, speed, and momentum. \n\nAnd the angle is never \"shitty\" due to a choice of car.

I find that most people once you get to Rising Star are solid in just about every area, but at Challenger Elite you have a ton of people who are pretty much there, but they have a weakness in an area or two.

Instead they do what I said before and it puts your team in a horrible position unless you play super conservative to try and cover up their delusional skill aggressiveness.

If that's not the case, you're better off just always playing it safe. Sometimes they will score b/c you didn't try to aerial it, but make them have to make the hard goal instead of missing and giving them the easy one. Make them make the hard save and get their block or if they miss you get the easy shot, than miss, they get the block/save, and then next thing you know they get a run out. \n\nAnd not everyone is the same. This may or may not be you, and I understand everyone, even people who are great with aerials are going to miss or miss hit and put the team in a bad position sometimes, but we all know the difference between someone who is clearly bad at aerials, yet tries to make every hit it seems an aerial, even when they didn't have to. Or the person who is bad at aerials and decides they need to go for the aerial that's closer to the ceiling than the ground instead of just playing it safe. Even if the other team manages to get it, odds are it's not going in unless you're playing someone who is just an absolute freak at aerials, which if that's the case you just have to accept it sometimes. 1 game you should have lost is not worth 2 games you should have won.", "id": "d9h7etf"}, {"comment": "> I can't reliably set up aerials on training to practice with\n\nTry http://www.rocketleaguetrainer.com/shots.

The alternative would be to create a sufficiently compelling singleplayer game experience within their entirely procedural world, something that's probably *far* more difficult than implementing multiplayer. The gameplay loop as it currently exists is only engaging for a few hours for most people. How do you go about adding depth and entertainment to a game that's designed for you to hop from planet to planet and never go back? Adding more NPCs to the space station or making the space pirate fights more interesting isn't going to cut it, you're talking about creating many entirely new gameplay mechanics. On the other hand, while it would be a substantial undertaking, adding multiplayer to No Man's Sky wouldn't be 4x the work they've already done. \n\nTo add multiplayer to a game like No Man's Sky, you'd need a server that hosts a single instance of the game world (mirrored across multiple geographic regions). This is simple enough, most of the existing code that maintains the world client-side can be reused for it, leaving out the rendering portion.\n\nYou'd need to modify the player entity so that multiple copies can exist, and you'd have to modify the client to send commands to the entity and display the world as the server describes it. \n\nInstead of loading a system from disk, or generating it on the fly, it would have to load it from the server, and also periodically listen for updates in case multiple players exist in the same system simultaneously, at which point the game would have to send updates for where the players and their ships are, and potentially structure upgrades if they start to build things.\n\nPlayers can already trade with NPCs, or be attacked by them (sentries), so much of that code can be reused to allow for player interaction (e.g. trading, combat). \n\nThe biggest complication is how to handle PC-PS4 cross-play, though the easiest solution is to just not support it, which I think most people would probably be okay with.\n\nHonestly, adding multiplayer at this point isn't some insane, insurmountable feat, simply because of how little you can actually do in the game. It would be smart for them to do it sooner rather than later, as the longer they wait, the more systems need to be reworked to accommodate multiple players.\n\n", "id": "daplba6"}, {"comment": "Sorry, you've got a big reply but I guess I was mostly just considering the last paragraph.
