I was just noticing that after a certain amount of time some gestures become \"standard\" across mobile apps and become adopted widely. \n\nPulling down to refresh comes to mind (which has widely replaced having a refresh button). \n\nSwiping to get rid of an image on social media seems might be the next. \n\nEven Google has adopted a more iOS standard in their more recent app releases. \n\nMaybe they can add a toggle in settings to let the user choose, but eventually, that's how software eventually becomes bloated. \n\nI understand how abrupt change is annoying. Especially this one which is around viewing images on Reddit. I mean, that's the biggest thing we do on the app. \n\nUltimately it's up to the devs to weigh choose, simplicity and the voice of the customers. I appreciate this forum where we can discuss.
