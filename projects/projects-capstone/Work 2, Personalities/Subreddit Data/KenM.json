If someone wants to date someone older or younger then them and they're both of legal age, they don't need my permission. People look for differences in personality and maturity that might not be immediately given at a certain age. If dating a 50 year old floats your boat, why do you need the permission of other people if you can legally be married to them.\n\nI can get having a problem with someone taking advantage of someone else, because that is creepy, but just because two people dating of a different age is weird doesn't mean it shouldn't happen at all.

They said nothing about age.\n\nSure I have misgivings about stuff other people do, but to be honest while it might be weird, I don't think marrying someone outside your age range is completely unacceptable. My personal rule would probably be within 10 years, personally, but that's because that's the age range my grandparents had when they got married. I suppose if you're well into your 50s, and are too old to be picky, you might be more lenient about who you date.\n\ntl;dr Yes, age brings problems, like people taking advantage of other people, but dating an adult older or younger then you isn't necessarily creepy, just something you might not be interested in.", "id": "cyj6mbx"}, {"comment": ">What happens when it's a 50 year old woman hitting on a 20 year old guy?\n\nActually, yes, to both your examples.

This entire subreddit consist of \"melts\". Almost every \"grilled cheese\" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called \"grilledcheese\" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled \"melts\" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac & cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples \"grilled cheeses\" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.\n\n>You god damn heretics.

Do you think pastors or priests are actually qualified in any way to talk about birth control? Depending on the denomination, a lot of them are virgins, or at the very least are not allowed to even have sex.\n\nAnd fundamentalist Christian denominations are completely opposed to any form of birth control or abortion at all, including the morning after pill, and instead promote abstinence-based policies that have been *scientifically proven* to be ineffective and to result in higher rates of teen pregnancy than approproate sexual education and widespread dispersal of prophylactics to those who need them.\n\nWhy would *anyone* talk to religious authorities with such shortcomings and clear biases about medical issues relating to sex and birth control? That would be like asking an antivaxxer for information about the polio vaccine.\n\nAnd are you suggesting that it's somehow only \"far-left\" \"SJWs\" types who would feel this way about birth control and pastors or priests?

I.E. the majority of Christians.\n\nAnd Catholics are expressly forbidden from using *any* form of birth control other than *natural* methods like pulling out and or monitoring a woman's fertility.\n\nBut beyond that, there is growing interest within other denominations, like Southern Baptists, to oppose not just abortifacients, but regular forms of birth control, like the pill:\n\n>Al Mohler, president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., responded that on that point, Lupfer \u201cunderstates his own case.\u201d\n\n>\u201cA good many evangelicals hope to do far more than sow seeds of doubt about the morality of birth control,\u201d Mohler replied. \u201cOur concern is to raise an alarm about the entire edifice of modern sexual morality and to acknowledge that millions of evangelicals have unwittingly aided and abetted that moral revolution by an unreflective and unfaithful embrace of the contraceptive revolution.\u201d\n\n>In 2008, Thomas White, then a professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and now president of Cedarville University, made headlines in a seminary chapel sermon denouncing birth-control pills as \u201cwrong,\u201d \u201cnot correct according to Scripture\u201d and\u2014in cases where the pill functions to prevent a fertilized ovum from implanting in the uterus\u2014\u201cmurder of a life.\u201d\n\n>Mohler asserts the contraceptive culture has weakened the institution of marriage. \u201cThe pill was the chemical agent for making the sexual revolution possible,\u201d he observed in 2010. \u201cThe pill made sex outside of marriage far easier to conceal, lowering the social cost of extramarital and premarital sex.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.baptiststandard.com/news/faith-culture/16187-southern-baptist-attitudes-changing-on-birth-control\n\nAnd in any case, the topic of this whole Ken M thread is the Morning After pill, which does kill a fertilized egg... and that *is* something not acceptable to these Christians groups.\n\nI'll admit I overstepped in saying that Christians are opposed to all forms of birth control. But considering that there are more Catholics than any other Christians on the planet, and *they* aren't allowed to have any birth control, and other denominations like Southern baptists don't allow certain forms of birth control (post conception ones), and now there is a movement to go against standard ones too...\n\nI fail to see why anyone in their right mind would listen to anything a priest or pastor would have to say about a sexual health issue.\n", "id": "d83t8fc"}, {"comment": "Because it's true ?

I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.\n\n> I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\n> Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.\n\n> We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \"November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\"\n\n> Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\n> Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\"\n\n> And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\n> Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \"Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\"\n\n> I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\"\n\n> For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, \"Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\"\n\n> It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.\n\n> For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.", "id": "d4zoks8"}, {"comment": "Fuck you, I cant see this without reading the whole thing.

I'm an absolute nerd in almost any sense, but I'm also interested in fitness, have good hygiene, and have reasonably decent social skills. Maybe n=1, but I highly doubt I'm the only nerd out there that doesn't belong on /r/justneckbeardthings.\n\n>If you think geeks are so sexy or cool, bang one. Go to any university and find a computer or physics lab at 2AM and take your pick.

The Spartan was originally a Beta Company candidate whose performance so impressed his superiors that he (along with a small number of his peers) was reassigned immediately after training before the inevitable bloodbath of Operation: TORPEDO. As one of the few remaining contemporary Spartan-IIIs, B312 was repurposed as a counter-terrorist operator, performing black operations. After several years of being fielded against Insurrectionists, B312 was transferred from his ONI handlers to Spartan NOBLE Team, where took the deceased Thom-A293's place as \"Noble Six\". B312's transfer to NOBLE came immediately at the start of the Fall of Reach, placing the Spartan in a new territory of teamwork against the Covenant.\nThough initially viewed with resentment by some of his teammates, Six's skills eventually proved themselves as the fight for Reach began failing and NOBLE Team took losses. On August 30, Six delivered a fragment of the AI Cortana to the UNSC Pillar of Autumn in hopes that the data she carried could defeat the Covenant. With the aid of his team, Noble Six delivered the AI intact, but chose to remain behind to secure the Autumn's escape from the Covenant. Though the Spartan was killed hours later his sacrifice allowed humanity to discover the Halo Array, ultimately bringing about the dissolution of the Covenant and the end of the war."], [-21, "this is a repost\n\nEdit: I am experiencing KenM culture shock"]], [[{"comment": "Beautiful.

The Spartan was originally a Beta Company candidate whose performance so impressed his superiors that he (along with a small number of his peers) was reassigned immediately after training before the inevitable bloodbath of Operation: TORPEDO. As one of the few remaining contemporary Spartan-IIIs, B312 was repurposed as a counter-terrorist operator, performing black operations. After several years of being fielded against Insurrectionists, B312 was transferred from his ONI handlers to Spartan NOBLE Team, where took the deceased Thom-A293's place as \"Noble Six\". B312's transfer to NOBLE came immediately at the start of the Fall of Reach, placing the Spartan in a new territory of teamwork against the Covenant.\nThough initially viewed with resentment by some of his teammates, Six's skills eventually proved themselves as the fight for Reach began failing and NOBLE Team took losses. On August 30, Six delivered a fragment of the AI Cortana to the UNSC Pillar of Autumn in hopes that the data she carried could defeat the Covenant. With the aid of his team, Noble Six delivered the AI intact, but chose to remain behind to secure the Autumn's escape from the Covenant. Though the Spartan was killed hours later his sacrifice allowed humanity to discover the Halo Array, ultimately bringing about the dissolution of the Covenant and the end of the war.", "id": "d1c1iud"}], [{"comment": "this is a repost\n\nEdit: I am experiencing KenM culture shock", "id": "d1bmzir"}, {"comment": "As is tradition", "id": "d1bnpw2"}, {"comment": "We are ALL reposts on this blessed day!", "id": "d1bnrqx"}, {"comment": "Speak for yourself.", "id": "d1bnrzl"}, {"comment": "Speak for yourself.", "id": "d1bns90"}, {"comment": "that is a common and enduring myth", "id": "d1boj7j"}, {"comment": "Please keep your complaints about Ken M reposts to reposts of complaints about Ken M reposts on Ken M reposts.", "id": "d1bpqqn"}, {"comment": "this is a repost", "id": "d1bpztv"}, {"comment": "I've seen your comment before, you're reposting it from other people who have called things reposts", "id": "d1bs0zk"}, {"comment": "I was just telling my students that people who call out reposts can be likened to that perennial pest, the male wasp.

While fiercely independent just after two years, the toddler's instincts do not adapt as easily in more warmer habitats. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Fun Factoid:**\n\nIn fact, the origin of the phrase \"temper tantrum\", primal behavior instinctive to the toddler, really is just a \"temperature tantrum\", or an outburst stemming from stress caused by the differences in temperature.

I was the king of the fucking world when I was 18... What I know now came from 10 years of life experience and I shared it with you for nothing...

It either gets better or it gets worse and sometimes the only thing you can change is your own perception of a situation.  If you don't like something, change it.

If there was no tip waiters wouldn't care\n\nThe first one is true but honestly wouldn't you rather the prices be higher and not have to worry about giving donations to people? I know I do. And for the second one that honestly baffles me. The only reason you're being friendly to me is because you expect a handout? That's ridiculous. And this lack of caring doesn't happen in Europe because they actually care about their job (mostly).\n\nI've worked in a restaurant in America and hated it. I'd much rather get a solid wage then wonder how much money I'm going to be taking home at the end of the night. And the waiters/tresses, at least where I worked, were so unbelievably fake it annoyed me to no end. Everyone would complain and bad mouth customers in the back \"Table 3 only gave me X\" or some bullshit like that. That's all they talked about and I couldn't stand it. And then what happens in the winter when people go out to eat less? Waiters come and go practically every year because they come in for the summer looking for a quick buck (and consequently don't care because they know they'll usually get at least 20% if they don't try) and then quit in the winter.\n\nBut then how do I make a statement against this? I can either not tip, which doesn't really get the message across to management. They still get their cut and I just hurt the waiters. Or I can just not go out to eat but that's equally ridiculous since I should be able to do what I want. There's a couple of restaurants that advertise as a no tipping restaurant and I really dig those and support them, but sometimes I want to go to a different one you know? People say you shouldn't go out to eat if I can't afford to tip but fuck you I paid the advertised price that should be enough. \n\nOccasionally a waiter will go above and beyond their service to me and really make my dining experience better, and that's when I want to tip, to show I really appreciate it. Not because they brought me my food with a half assed smile and expect a 20% cut.\n\nAnd people get really passionate about tipping. I've gone out to eat with others and gotten into arguments with people over my lack of desire to tip. I know I'm being passionate right now about tipping but in real life I don't go on a tirade about it.\n\nBut I should really limit my posts to reposts of Ken M", "id": "d75qzna"}, {"comment": "> If there was no tip waiters wouldn't care\n\nI'll never understand this argument, because I don't get tipped at my job but I still perform.

But as all important truths of science must gradually become commonplace and everyday matters, even this small amount of pleasure ceases, just as we have long ceased to take pleasure in learning the admirable multiplication table. Now if Science goes on giving less pleasure in herself, and always takes more pleasure in throwing suspicion on the consolations of metaphysics, religion and art, that greatest of all sources of pleasure, to which mankind owes almost its whole humanity, becomes impoverished. Therefore a higher culture must give man a double brain, two brain -chambers, so to speak, one to feel science and the other to feel non-science, which can lie side by side, without confusion, divisible, exclusive ; this is a necessity of health. In one part lies the source of strength, in the other lies the regulator ; it must be heated with illusions, onesidednesses, passions ; and the malicious and dangerous consequences of over-heating must be averted by the help of conscious Science. If this necessity of the higher culture is not satisfied, the further course of human development can almost certainly be foretold : the interest in what is true ceases as it guarantees less pleasure ; illusion, error, and imagination reconquer step by step the ancient territory, because they are united to pleasure ; the ruin of science : the relapse into barbarism is the next result ; mankind must begin to weave its web afresh after having, like Penelope, destroyed it during the night.

But as all important truths of science must gradually become commonplace and everyday matters, even this small amount of pleasure ceases, just as we have long ceased to take pleasure in learning the admirable multiplication table. Now if Science goes on giving less pleasure in herself, and always takes more pleasure in throwing suspicion on the consolations of metaphysics, religion and art, that greatest of all sources of pleasure, to which mankind owes almost its whole humanity, becomes impoverished. Therefore a higher culture must give man a double brain, two brain -chambers, so to speak, one to feel science and the other to feel non-science, which can lie side by side, without confusion, divisible, exclusive ; this is a necessity of health. In one part lies the source of strength, in the other lies the regulator ; it must be heated with illusions, onesidednesses, passions ; and the malicious and dangerous consequences of over-heating must be averted by the help of conscious Science. If this necessity of the higher culture is not satisfied, the further course of human development can almost certainly be foretold : the interest in what is true ceases as it guarantees less pleasure ; illusion, error, and imagination reconquer step by step the ancient territory, because they are united to pleasure ; the ruin of science : the relapse into barbarism is the next result ; mankind must begin to weave its web afresh after having, like Penelope, destroyed it during the night.

The Fitra is a concept of living a natural/proper Muslim life.\n\n----\n\nAs a result of these passages, many Jewish families would consider it impossible to live their faith in a country that prohibits circumcision of minors.\n\nFor Muslims it would be possible, but not well supported. Demanding legal age (such as 16 or 18) would not go over easy with many, as they see it as important to fulfill the fitra at an earlier age, so circumcision is typically done before puberty (until age 12 or 13).
