Whether it takes 100 or 1000 interactions at some point you've done it all before and just quit stressing it as much. \n\n2) Sometimes confidence can come from **knowing** you aren't the best conversationalist. \"Fuck it\" can be applied in multiple ways. \"Fuck it, I'm not scared!\" or \"Fuck it, I'm a little awkward and I DGAF.\"\n\n3) You know those times you feel more confident for no reason? Maybe the sun is brighter than usual or you just kicked someones ass in Halo. Have a conversation when you are feeling good. Seems obvious but easy to get in a funk and other people pick up on it.\n\n4) Initiate some conversations with no expectations, end goals, etc. Instead of writing someone and hoping to hook up / date / whatever just talk to them for the sake of conversation. What are their interests? How was their day? Where was that picture taken? If you go to bed without her number or her interest don't consider that \"losing\". You talked to someone, hopefully enjoyed the interaction and that is good enough. If it leads to more then great, if not fuck it.\n\n5) Unless you are completely socially inept try being honest. No front, no games, no holding frame, etc. If you are looking for a hookup only and someone asks, tell them exactly that. Honesty is underrated and if you are being honest it's a lot easier to be confident. Goes back to \"fuck it\". \"Now I'm second guessing if I should have sent that message.\" or \"I swiped because you're hot as hell but now I'm nervous.\" or \"I swiped because you are hot as hell and I want to see you in person.\" Any of these would be fine.
