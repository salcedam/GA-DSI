And because of that, it's not always clear-cut which sex you belong to, there is such a (relatively rare) thing as intersex people that don't neatly fit either category.\n\nThen beyond that is the psychological aspect, gender. Basically, whether you feel like a man, woman, or neither. Trans actually isn't even a gender. Trans just means you don't identify with the gender you were assigned at birth (as opposed to being cis, which means you do). Most commonly, this will be people who think of themselves as women but were raised as men, or vice versa. But there are also lots of people that don't identify either as men or women.

Looper notes the androgynous Maize Deity and masculine Moon goddess of Maya mythology, and iconography and inscriptions where rulers embody or impersonate these deities. He suggests that the third gender could also include two-spirit individuals with special roles such as healers or diviners.[150]\n\n>Anthropologist and archaeologist Miranda Stockett notes that several writers have felt the need to move beyond a two-gender framework when discussing prehispanic cultures across mesoamerica,[151] and concludes that the Olmec, Aztec and Maya peoples understood \"more than two kinds of bodies and more than two kinds of gender.\" Anthropologist Rosemary Joyce agrees, writing that \"gender was a fluid potential, not a fixed category, before the Spaniards came to Mesoamerica. Childhood training and ritual shaped, but did not set, adult gender, which could encompass third genders and alternative sexualities as well as \"male\" and \"female.\" At the height of the Classic period, Maya rulers presented themselves as embodying the entire range of gender possibilities, from male through female, by wearing blended costumes and playing male and female roles in state ceremonies.\" Joyce notes that many figures of mesoamerican art are depicted with male genitalia and female breasts, while she suggests that other figures in which chests and waists are exposed but no sexual characteristics (primary or secondary) are marked may represent a third sex, ambiguous gender or androgyny.[152]\n\nTwo-spirit is a very common idea for Natives. \n\n>Historically, the Indigenous people of Illinois have decided the gender of their members based on their childhood behavior.

I'm a big fan of [OK Pal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAFlBd7SNcE&nohtml5=False) and [Claudia Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2cbSTX6zmI&index=8&list=PL7CZ4TImzrFk6vci4vWnMfHmYPV0rgSDR&nohtml5=False), and (although it's not quite the same vibe) [~~Outro~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKIrPuLm48M) (accidentally posted a fan cut extended version... [this is the album version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DJ3-BVMjOs)) from the same album is one of my favorites. [New Map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPaK9Ih2jOQ&nohtml5=False) is my favorite song off that album though -- it makes me want to fly into the sun in the greatest way possible. The whole album is really beautiful in my opinion... Just the right mix of bright beats and a bit of indulgence into some of their more emotional and melodramatic tracks. The vibe feels to me like a musical retelling of the beauty and emotion of teenage years from a really rosy perspective on even the bad parts (that's just me though).\n\n[Saturdays = Youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkerJgpIEb0&nohtml5=False) is one of their quieter albums -- less energy and a little more immersion into the downtempo introspection. [Graveyard Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkerJgpIEb0&feature=youtu.be&t=15m16s) was one of their bigger singles and is the more uptempo of the album; the peppiest song about dejected disillusionment and death that you'll ever hear. \n\nIf you like M83 and want to check out some of their older stuff, [Dead Cities, Red Seas and Lost Ghosts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBp4qGtooPk&list=PL7CZ4TImzrFnvE_-V5rE56G4dWksV0xZv&nohtml5=False) are more towards the glitchy side but also some of their most fun stuff, I think -- satisfaction gleaned from that album is directly proportional to the volume you play it at in my opinion. Also from that album, [Unrecorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOFzsbD-PTA&list=PL7CZ4TImzrFnvE_-V5rE56G4dWksV0xZv&index=2&nohtml5=False) has a sort of Moby meets M83 vibe to it, which I really like.\n\nThey're touring right now so if you like their stuff a lot, check out if they're gonna be near you :) I'm gonna be seeing them in a couple weeks myself :D\n\nEDIT: Forgot about one of their most beautiful songs in my opinion: [Beauties Can Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axUYH0wYR6s)\n", "id": "d1zf8vc"}, {"comment": "I started reading this thinking it was a Patrick Bateman copy pasta.

Even then, the kamagata usuba has been created to provide a sharp tip for piercing. Both the deba and yanagiba have pointy tip for dealing with fish efficiently.

Sex is biological. Gender is psychological. You don't chose either one, but you do chose what to do when the universe says \"fuck you in particular\".\n\nYou don't get to choose your sex. You're born male / female / intersex. And you don't get to choose your gender, in that your brain is born and develops your gender without giving you a choice in the matter. You can be born with male parts (male sex) but with a female wired brain (female gender). It happens, the human brain is incredibly complex and it's duct tape and refactored code all the way down. \n\nThe medical condition when sex (biological) and gender (brain wiring) don't play nice with each other is called gender dysphoria. Imagine if you woke up in a girl's body tomorrow. That's what it's like. It's jarring and like a bad sci-fi film or a Quantom Leap episode that doesn't end. It's a real thing that results in ridiculous amounts of suicide. The only choice they made during this process was the suicide. So that's where you're right.\n\nSo what you DO get to choose is how you handle being born with this mixup. Some repress their brain's wiring in favor of conforming to their body's sex and others modify their body's sex or appearance in order to reflect their brain. Some feel they can't live like this in a world where people constantly shit on them so they off themselves.

And the redpill sticky currently at the top of the sub... The delusions of these people are just staggering.\n\nFrom that thread\n>I wondered why the things around me are like they are and I found TheRedPill, which redpilled me on women. Then I slowly moved towards Nazism and here I am.\n\nand \n\n>Always a leftist-environmentalist. Still an an environmentalist (a lot of environmentalists are pretty close to 14/88 for obvious reasons, but due to SJW/Jewish infiltration we have to hide our power level extremely well) . I reconsidered my view on Nazism when I read an article in New Scientist (a normie publication), which was called something like 'what if Hitler won', about Hitler's environmental policies. Realizing that the Nazis were environmentalists was huge for me. Even though I still believed in muh civic nationalism and The Shoah, from a purely rational perspective, the crime of killing 6 million Jews seemed irrelevant compared to the virtues of establishing a world order which respects man's place in nature and the importance of preserving the biosphere for future generations. I believed this because a Nazi future was better than no future (which is where we're headed, unless our population is drastically reduced in numbers, and leads a simpler, less materialistic life afterwards).\nI slept on these ideas for years, more busy with education and career than things that really mattered.\nI came across an article (I'm sorry, I can't find it) that the Nazis wanted to preserve the remaining ancient forests in Europe, and breed ancient European animals like Aurochs from their modern descendants so that ascendant SS officers could go into the forest and hunt animals with spears as part of a spiritual journey. The mere idea that a political entity would do anything that awesome was enough to reconsider the Nazis, which lead me to the Greatest Story Never Told, which I watched a year ago.\nOne of my biggest beefs with the contemporary alt-right is the lack of environmentalism. I want to see a future where our primeval forests are safe from the axe and chainsaw. I want there to be ferocious, primeval beasts roaming within those forests, so that those who want to ascend spiritually can test themselves against nature itself, or die.\n\nand multiple other shameless references to Nazism. \"uncle hitler\".

I can link to 2 hour movie as long as I link to the end only but that would be grossly breaking the spirit of the sub. \n\nThat's not what inspired this sub, and not the original meaning with the haikus. [See the comment that inspired the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/qylyk/did_i_win/c41lmqr), which you are well aware of. The whole point of haikus/poetry is that the videos are fully self-contained, not jerked out from a longer segment. \n\nI get that sometimes it's a shame not to link something just because it's 31 seconds long, but you have people linking [just middle of the song](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubehaiku/comments/56ttzj/poetry_trump_amp_clinton_presidential_duet) without you removing it.

So basically the only thing that changes is that the original uploader gets no credit.\n\nI don't see how our current policy is against the spirit of the sub. It's a 30 second clip either way you look at it. Who cares if there was 2 minutes that came before it? Who cares if there was 10 minutes that came before it? Those 30 seconds are the only part that counts. \n\nLots of the legit <30 second poetry/haiku videos on this sub are actually just cut versions of longer videos anyways.

Haiku/poetry, as you can see in the comment that started the sub, are videos featuring a *self-contained* scene, it fit within either 15 or 30 seconds, it wasn't half of a longer segment. Even the pocket sand example is self-containing. \n\nYeah, the Clinton vs Trump is still short and funny, but not in the haiku way. It's just a short funny video segment.  \n\n> How are these any better than linking 30 seconds into a minute long video? The end result is exactly the same.\n\nAt least people will put some effort into creating self-containing videos rather than linking to random funny segments. Which, in itself, will filter out some low-quality. \n\nThis probably comes off as nitpicking, but the sub been lately going from poetic videos into forced meme humor and american funniest videos.

I think these days what you linked wouldn't be described as it anymore (kinda similar to what happened to \"future bass\") but it's cool to see where it came from.

It was written as a cry against \"feels\", but works to talk about fandom in general.\n\n>The second, possibly more fervent reason I'm so often revolted by \"feels\" is because of the way it's held of like a symbol of merit. \"OH GOD MY FEELS!\" frequently comes with this undertone of ownership. \"I was really affected by this emotionally which makes me fundamentally closer to this work of fiction than you, who wasn't.\" I really see this become apparent in certain hardcore fandoms, Doctor Who being a good example (Sherlock is another possible candidate.)\n\n>This attitude makes sense, and it happens with all types of art everywhere. People are emotionally attached to their favorite works of fiction or theater or music because those things affected them and have become important. But in the past couple years it seems like a close attachment to media has become a goal within itself. We've always defined ourselves by our tastes in culture, pop or otherwise, but more and more I see people care less about how they actually feel about art, and more about letting people know they felt something and that worries me as a writer.\n\n>Maybe it's a social media thing? With the rise of first myspace, now tumblr and pintrest, the fiction you ingest has taken on the characteristics of a brand identity. Your jeans are Calvin Klein, your purse Louis Vuitton, but your tumblr is Benedict Cumberbatch. Except anyone can own Benedict Cumberbatch. You didn't have to drop $300 on him like you did your shoes/wallet, so how do you really make him yours? You talk about your feels. That culture of enthusiasm-as-currency is everywhere (I fall prey to it too) and it FRUSTRATES me to no end. Mostly because I believe it! I believe in the enthusiasm! Maybe it's exaggerated or inflated for the public square but there's still something there, at the core. People really care about Sherlock, or Doctor Who, or Potter, or House of Cards, or George Saunders, or Wicked, or Who's Afraid, they do! And we are better equipped than ever to actually talk about WHY we care. We could have a really fantastic, meaningful exchange about what makes these things we love so lovable, but instead we're filling up the internet with empty and platitudinous enthusiasm.\n\n\nLooking back, I still believe this, but it bothers me way less.", "id": "d2d4awq"}, {"comment": "Thanks for sharing.

Someone gotta cut and upload the raw video too, so it's \"user created\". Or user-created stuff like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubehaiku/comments/3cei48/haiku_smells_like_teen_shovel/), which kinda fall under \"poetry\", but aren't in same league as the [bork videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubehaiku/comments/51f9do/poetry_meme_jurassic_bork/?ref=search_posts), which lost that random, whimsical vibe that made this subreddit great. Without such videos as my first link, sub would quickly become a variation of America's Funniest Home Videos.\n\nReddit has a good piece on that in their official FAQ under \"[Why does reddit need moderation? Can't you just let the voters decide?](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_why_does_reddit_need_moderation.3F_can.27t_you_just_let_the_voters_decide.3F)\":\n\n> The reason there are separate subreddits is to allow niche communities to form, instead of having one monolithic overall community. These communities distinguish themselves with a unique focus, look and policies: what's on- and off-topic there, whether people are expected to behave civilly or can feel free to be brutal, etc.\n\n> One issue that arises is that casual, new, or transient visitors to a particular community don't always know the rules that tie it together.\n\n> As an example, imagine a /r/swimming and a /r/scuba. People can read about one topic or the other (or subscribe to both). But since scuba divers like to swim, a casual user might start submitting swimming links on /r/scuba. And these stories will probably get upvoted, especially by people who see the links on the reddit front page and don't look closely at where they're posted. If left alone, /r/scuba will just become another /r/swimming and there won't be a place to go to find an uncluttered listing of scuba news.\n\n> The fix is for the /r/scuba moderators to remove the offtopic links, and ideally to teach the submitters about the more appropriate /r/swimming subreddit.\n\nThe whole \"let upvotes decide\" doesn't work once a niche sub passes 100k subs, give or take a few, as it gets flooded with mainstream users who don't give a shit and will upvote anything as long as it's even remotely related to the subreddits theme. It's kinda sad when mods throw in the towel and let a niche community be flooded with low-effort memes. If they no longer have time/interest to upkeep the original vision, they should just recruit new people who do.\n\nOnly exceptions I've seen are more \"general\" subs like /r/BlackPeopleTwitter, which are already pretty low-effort but have a clear theme newcomers easily understand, and /r/CrappyDesign, where mods just flat out said that they moderate after quality, not upvotes, and remove low-effort \"omg look at kerning guys\" posts. You know, actually following their roles as moderators according to Reddit FAQ.\n\nAlthough, I don't contribute myself to the sub so I'm not exactly the shining example, but then again, you don't need to be a cook to realize the chicken you're eating is under-cooked. What we have in /r/youtubehaiku attracting lots of users with an overlap of interests in poetic videos, memes and funny videos. So submissions that contain all of that get upvoted despite not really being part of this subreddit's original vision and mods just seemingly gave up on trying to enforce any kind of quality because hey, quantity > quality, right. \n\n", "id": "da17an1"}, {"comment": "Hmm, when I say user-created content, even something like the Smells Like Teen Shovel video is kind of crossing the line. I would say it is more of a meme than true poetry. I admit that there are quite a lot of cases like this, where it isn't exactly clear what would constitute user-created content.. and sure, they *kinda* are poetry, as you say. I think for it to work, and in a way truly differentiate itself from this sub, you would have to just straight up not allow content that had been edited to derive from, add to, or alter another media source.

Shitty fucking memes are everywhere, and different internet cultures kinda meshed together over last few years due to social media exposure. It's a bit annoying seeing people just regurgitate memes to their eventual deaths, without putting any true effort in creating it a joke, or giving it a refreshing or fantastic context. When you think about it, the same comes with all aspects of comedy. I'm sure at one point \"Go back to the kitchen\" was legitimately something shocking and funny, but now even the biggest misogynists will roll their eyes when someone unironically says it. Lots of memes are basically observational humour. To a lot of people like myself, they're goddamn boring. It's 5% joke, 95% context and delivery. Look at /r/BlackPeopleTwitter content. Is \"lol black people be like\" actually funny after being done the hundredth time? No, not really. The joke is dead and completely expected, which is why twitter humour is probably the worst fucking thing of all time. But imagine Ari Shaffir going on a rant with the joke, Norm MacDonald doing some amazing deadpan, or Chris Morris coming up with some absolutely absurd sketch. It might be funny then.\n\nI'v noticed a difference in *chan board epin maymays. Content was more understandable without context, applicable to daily situations, and could be modified for just about anything. That allowed the growth of garbage rage comics. Then content became kinda \"weirder\". To exemplify, Pepe and Wojak falls under the same category, but it's harder to modify images, and expressing yourself as a frog is definitely more unusual and requires some understanding of epin maymays. Newer content has become more absurd and difficult to modify. Take a look at dumb /int/ memes: They're more text-based so it's less identifiable as some epin maymay by your 52 year old aunt, absurd to a point of offence, and can't be readily applicable to daily situations.

So people thought she was kidnapped, she was forced to do videos etc. This started the hash tag \" # savemarinajoyce\" people wanting to get in contact with her parents find out where she lived send police over. None of it worked so conspiracy people went nuts, saying in some videos she mummers \"help me\" (proven it was doctored) and during some live steams saying stuff like \"make a heart with your hands if you are in trouble\" and that is one of her common just mannerisms so she did it and people were like \"oh shit\". \n\nThen she tweeted out she wanted to party and rave with her subscribers so told a place and people lost their minds. People think if you go there you are going to get murdered, you are going to be sacrificed to a cult. Some even saying that this was an ISIS trap that they are going to bomb or shoot up the club they are raving. A few internet news stations even warned people this might be an ISIS  set up and told people not to go. \n\nEventually it was found out to just be a party and she apologized saying she used to like doing stuff like that when she had a small following (about 100k subscribers) and now it is kinda of inappropriate (she gained close to 1 million when the hash tag save marina joyce was trending).\n\nEventually she comes out saying she isn't being forced or anything she is \"fine\" and gives very random excuses for things. [here is a really good video By Phil DeFranco talking about this whole ordeal and actually having an interview with her]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYj8YsfhYBA)\n\nIf you don't want to watch the video very very basically it shows Marina joyce acting very odd with a 1 on 1 interview with Phill thanking the internet several times even though she is talking with him. And doing random heart things and such and is rather off putting. she gives a lot of (in my personal opinion) weak reasons why x y or z. her videos changed because she got so many \"beautiful people on her channel\" and she needs to know how to mange it. Doesn't make much sense because she only got the boom after people started getting worried about her. The interview is really good to try and get the full scope but bottom line it just seems she was a very weird girl and people got worried for little things. \n\nAfter this people think she is doing it for the fame to get like 1.5 million subscribers at this point so they think this is a joke.\n\nPeople thought the story ended here but unfortunately we were wrong. \n\na little while later she posts [this on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/iRaindropsx/photos/a.577219768960027.149134.509822679033070/1402141096467886/?type=3)\n\nIf you don't want to read it i will summarize this the best i can. Marina joyce apparently discovered how to talk after death in the \"after life\" so to speak she found \"secrets\" if you will in the afterlife. She wants to create a temple in south america Peru where she can stay as \"god of the shrine\" god of love. She wants to promote spiritual healing and strong energy connections there and pretty much wants to make it a spiritual retreat. Specifically called a \"Kundalini Yoga Meditation retreat\" which some of these retreats focus on using mind alternating drugs in therapy. so there is the link with marina joyce and her being out of touch with the world with all these claims. She later goes on if she acchieves godhood she will save the world of poverty,save the animals, and just save the world from any problem with a click of her fingers as a god of \"divine love and spiritual guidance\" \n\nshe ended it with she needs people to help build it, make money to help build it and after it is done you will some how earn money from it. \n\n\n\nSo yeah it seems very clear the shift in her videos has been due to usage of psychedelic drugs to alter her mind and she needs help but it appears no one in her circle is helping her. So it is a very sad tale and people tried reaching out but you cannot control people honestly. \n\nSorry for the big ass post but you wanted the full scoop.\n\n**TL:DR**- bitch is hot but bonkers ", "id": "d74bqq6"}, {"comment": "Maybe it's drugs, but that sounds more like a mental illness.

In August, political scientist Alan Abramowitz predicted that there would be a 66% chance of a Republican victory.   \n> \n  \nThere are a ton of factors that contributed to why and how this whole thing went down the way it did, and it is all worth examining in great detail, but we cannot change the results.

All I'm claiming is that it would have been a fight.  \n\nBut, again, we're viewing all of this through the lens of the Clinton-Trump election fallout.

The final layer of humor comes from the discomfort in a white guy finding a book of songs that may be considered racist by some, and just attempting to play along with it. \n\nI hope this helps!

Yes, that was a very loaded question and he was pressured pretty hard for an answer. But he still gave a pretty definitive answer: women should be punished, in some way, for getting abortions. And of course, he went back on that and said that it's the doctors who should be punished, not the women. I'm sure you'll argue that that was just an answer that he had to come up with on the spot, and so he wasn't prepared for it. You seem to be somewhat pro-Trump, so I'll ask you: why is that any better? Why is the fact that he choked that hard under the stress of a single journalist better? Why would you want the guy who made that call under that comparatively minuscule amount of pressure to be the most powerful man on Earth?\n\n>I remember that he's met thousands upon thousands of people and can't be expected to remember everyone he's met.

Around the 1:15 mark, he says that he does, in fact, know he David Duke is. Within the context, it's implied that he was aware at the time he made the statement as well. He then goes on to blame it all on a faulty earpiece. I will concede that this particular point isn't quite as damning as the others, as I highly doubt that Trump is a white supremacist. Perhaps he was just confused and not prepared (which, again, is why he'd be a bad president).\n\nIf you think Trump is any better than any of the career politicians on the stage, you're deluding yourself. He's a liar, just like the rest of him. You just like the things he says, so you give him a pass. But at the end of the day, the fact that his fuckups make nice soundbites does not change the fact that he fucked up, and it does not change the fact that he has consistently revised his platform as a result of negative reactions to the ridiculous things he says. ", "id": "d2fbavl"}, {"comment": ">you have to take out their families.\n\n\n\nYou can interpret that any way you want but he never said \"kill innocent civilians\". Again, this argument never holds sway for me personally because harboring combatants, allowing them to attack from your house, allowing them to make bombs in your house, makes you a combatant too. I wouldn't have a problem killing those people, but again he never le said that. And I'm not seeing in the article you linked where he \"went back on those comments\" anyway. Hell, the *title* says he defended them.\n\n\n\n\n>why is that any better?\n\n\n\nI don't care for Trumps stance on abortion and a lot of people feel it's just a hardline GOP idea that he adopted to get through the primary, but even I can see that going through literally *thousands* of hours of interviews you're going to get little soundbites like this. Just like Sanders talking about how white people can't be poor. That's why they have the opportunity to *clarify* their comments and I'll take someone who knows when he misspoke over someone who sticks with being wrong. \n\n\n\n\n\n>I'll concede this piece isn't as damping\n\n\n\n\nAnd yet it keeps getting brought up. I've seen the clip, again, and I see a man knowing when he's not qualified to answer until he does more research. That's an extremely politically savvy thing to do. It definitely doesn't scream \"going back on his word\" to me, but interpret that how you like.\n\n\n\n\n\n>He's a liar, just like the rest of them\n\n\n\n\nSo how does that make him a less legitimate candidate, assuming that were true? Your original statement said he's less qualified because he goes back on his statements but then you say all the politicians on stage do. I never once said he was any more trustworthy than anybody else. You just think he's unqualified because you *don't* like the things he says.\n\n\n\n>He significantly revised his platform\n\n\n\nThis is the most wrong thing you've said. How is knowing or not knowing who David Duke is a platform? How did he change on being hard on ISIS? How was any of this even considered a \"platform\". He consistently uses phrases like \"we'll have to look at [scenario/person/law] and see\". He's spent his entire business career putting together extremely effective teams and the expectation is that he'd do the same as president and come up with cohesive plans to fit what he says.

In-browser flash games and mobile are skewed pretty heavily towards the female demographic for example. You won't find many good statistics on the subject though. You'll find that the questions leading to a statistic that says women make up most of the consumer base for games can be kind of tricky. In a [Pew Research report](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/the-demographics-of-device-ownership/) it was shown that 42% of adult American women own a game console compared to 37% for men. Since it wasn't a study specifically targeting game console ownership (it's about electronic devices in general) or use of a game console it's not something anyone should throw around as a useful statistic. Ownership can mean having a console in their household and not using it, for example buying a console for a child. When I was a kid I knew a lot of kids whose mother bought them NES/SNESes but didn't use them. The reason I go into detail about this study is because publications like Polygon and PCGamer reported on it saying that gamers are a majority female now when that really doesn't seem to be the case.  \n\nThere's an interesting statistic on the Wii U from 2014 where Nintendo showed the age and gender of owners who access the eshop. 70% of all Wii Us regularly accessed the eshop, and the gender breakdown was 93% male 7% female. \n\nI'm gonna try and dig up some statistics on mobile and browser games. I'll edit them in if you want. One study and a user demographic infodump isn't really a convincing enough argument on their own. ", "id": "d7d66o5"}, {"comment": "cool.

I enjoyed the episodes, but it kinda cockteased us with the story.

There's nothing wrong with sex - it's fun, we're (mostly) all into it.  But I can't blame women for being irked when their representation in a large part of anime is as eye candy with very little substance otherwise.  That's not puritanism, it's just not wanting to be degraded.\n\n\nFan service in general (not just on sex, but overall) is something that should be dabbled in tastefully instead of being the crutch that holds up an entire series.  Utilize it too much and the show itself feels empty.  It's part of why I had to stop watching Fairy Tail, it just felt so damn hollow after a while.", "id": "da7qmfl"}, {"comment": "There is absolutely nothing wrong with porn.\n\nIf fan service is the \"crux of the entire series,\" what you're looking at is soft-core porn.

Even the shit that tries to make fun of the tropes is overexaggerated. I barely got through Gurren Lagan and I barely paid attention to it.

Fanservice is arguably more of a problem in anime than it is in Western media since it's one of the biggest enablers of people idolizing, if not fetishizing their favorite characters (and oftentimes their voice actresses). Then studios start pumping out more and more fanservice because it sells, and quality starts to plummet because everyone's throwing panty shots and boob gropes into everything - all to pander to a subset of their audience.\n\nLike /u/Sapharodon mentioned in a comment above, fanservice oftentimes leads to neglect of both the story and its characters.

The closest thing to an explanation I could find is that there was a [Ghost Town DJ's and INOJ split](https://www.discogs.com/Ghost-Town-DJs-Inoj-My-Boo-Time-After-Time/release/2286838) that had My Boo and then an INOJ track.  I guess the youtube poster was confused as to which song was by which artist. \n\nAnd then I was confused by their title \"INOJ - I Want To Be Your Lady Baby\".  I assumed that they would title it \"Artist - Song\" but they did \"Artist - Hook Lyric\".  I see now in the video description they say the song is \"INOJ (My Boo)\".

So, anyone specializing in this type of craftsmanship would, proudly, be known as a chuckman. Eventually, with more modern tools and techniques, it became the job of an apprentice which is why they started using boy (chuckboy). It's not really known how Chuck became Fuck, but it's believed to have been used jovially until it just stuck.\n\nGiven the use of today's tools, techniques, and training, carpenters no longer specialize in such niche subjects and we have no use for terms such as chuckman, which is why it is no longer heard.", "id": "cymo4qk"}, {"comment": "10/10", "id": "cymodmb"}, {"comment": "I feel like I'm being obviously trolled but I can't say I know enough about door hinges to call you out.", "id": "cymzfvt"}, {"comment": "Wow thanks.

First of all, his name was actually JuanDiego Montoya, he played for DIAF (Die in a Fire) and FOH (Flowers of Happiness). He just showed up on the scene at a South California LAN that I worked at one day. I remember the first time this kid walked into the place. I say walked but I swear it kind of looked like he was floating on air. He was wearing this weirdass grey gui and sandals. His eyes looked like they were burning red but you could tell it was from no sleep and too much CRT. He didn't really 'talk' so much as he communicated through a series of facial expressions. Anyway, this kid walks over to the counter, buys an all-day pass, 4 bowls of kimchi, 4 cans of arizona ice tea, and looks directly at me and says (and I say 'says' but I swear he didn't actually use words) \"Valar Morghulis\". Well this was weird as fuck because only a week earlier, the local sponsor for the big $5,000 LAN we were hosting had pulled me aside and told me that a fucked up kid might show up and ask to register a 1-man team for the tournament. He told me that the kid would say the phrase \"Valar Morghulis\" and that I should register his 1-man team, despite our rules.\nThe first game JD (as those of us who knew him call him) played was on de_inferno. He literally sat in spawn the entire T half and allowed the CTs to 14-0. On the 15th round, he bought for the first time: a desert eagle, a grenade, no armor. He then threw the grenade directly in front of himself and naded down to half hp, then typed \"Hello. My name is JuanDiego Montoya. You killed my brother. Prepare to die.\" Next thing I know, this kid bunnyhops up T-ramp, up the ladder, quick deags two mid awpers, bunnyhops down to Mexico and gets two Banana pusher with one taps, and now with 2 rounds left, he shoots one off in the sky and starts yelling at the top of his lungs \"VALHALLLLLAAAAA\" and just runs straight up mid towards the last dude who is now trying to rotate through boiler. Now this last dude was actually one of the only known players to ever master the complete recoil pattern of the para. His name was Johnny R and one time we actually calculated that he could compensate for about 97% of the para recoil... and he had a para! Well JD pushed out of mid exactly as Johnny R pushed out of boiler, Johnny R quickswitches to para and starts letting out the sickest para spray I have ever seen, like 100% accuracy to JD's dome. And then, the incident. Few counter strike players know this, but back in 1.6, you could actually anti-recoil an opponent. Basically, if you could do a pixel perfect opposite movement of the recoil pattern your opponent was inputting, the game essentially \"blocked\" that specific bullet from registering. So as Johnny R is emptying the entire para clip at JD and hitting 100% recoil compensation accuracy, JD is hitting 100% anti-recoil. It was some crazy shit to watch. Then you hear Johnny R's \"click click click\" and JD quickswitches from knife (you need to have knife out to anti-recoil) to the desert eagle, and with the last bullet, he one taps Johnny R.\nEntire LAN is quiet for 7 full seconds. Count out to 7 right now... that's a long ass time. Then, before any of us have a chance to say anything, we realize that the round hasn't ended for some reason... behind JD, something spawned in Mexico. I can't tell you exactly what because all I could see was a bright white light on my screen... but I looked over to the JD's screen and his was the only one that actually showed this demon looking creature with a sceptre. JD needs to reload, demon is rushing at him, instead of bunny hopping away or going down with his knife, he starts to type out \"JAB JAB FORWARD JAB FIERCE\" in all caps into the console. Everyone's screens go black, flicker 5 times, and then light up again. JD was gone. The map was set to de_dust for some reason but in T spawn, beside a dead terrorist body, there was a chest. I looted it real quick and held onto it for years. Then, one day, I randomly thought about trying a CS GO operation key on the chest.
