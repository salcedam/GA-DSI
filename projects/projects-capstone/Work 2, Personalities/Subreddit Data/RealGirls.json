This may be obvious, but show her gratitude and treat her well and make her feel beautiful, and if you do those things most women (especially those who have agreed to marry you) will be open to expanding horizons, as long as you are patient and go at her pace, only pushing her gently. \n\nI hope that helps you and good luck!

Doesn't mean you don't look at other people. Just means you're not obvious/rude about it.\n\nIt's nice if you have a partner who is more secure than average and comfortable chatting about other hot people.

Or unless they're infected, which they really really shouldn't be. There's way too much blood flow there to foster a normal infection. Maybe if you just straight up don't shower...\n\nYes, they can get hung on things like lacy tops, underwire, luffas, and dresses with ribbing, and yes, that hurts, but there's no reason that normal daily or sexual activity should cause the piercing to tear or bleed after it's healed. \n\nAlso, anything-goes-fun-zones are a lot more fun when they're supercharged with increased sensitivity.\n\nThey also don't negatively affect breastfeeding.

There are guys who want one partner and more who want many.  It doesn't mean that someone can't be monogamous, but it does mean that there are tons of guys with a wandering eye, and that's how it goes.\n\nEven you probably experienced the dopamine high that comes from a new partner.  I mean, there ain't much comparable, to be honest.  In addition, a new sexual partner does a lot of good stuff, like boosting testosterone levels.  This was a huge evolutionary benefit in the past when we didn't have the massive populations and diseases running through society that we do today.  Basically, human evolution can't keep up with societal evolution.\n\nThat being said, you can't be a new partner for someone, so what can you do, other than just being his best friend.  Both people have a tendency to become lazy about keeping up their optimal appearance when they have been together a while, and sex becomes a chore (In my experience, women experience the 'chore' thing more than men).  As long as you (and him!!!) want to look good for each other, AND they both actually show sexual interest in each other, then you're fine.  Without that, you're, well, fucked.\n\nMake sure that you talk about sexual interests and fantasies.  This can be compromising.  He might want to do stuff that you don't want to do.  I'm not telling you to do bukkake with his buddies, but I'm also saying that if you find common sexual interest, there is only one way to find out.\n\nBasically, maintain the way you were when you got together (kids not withstanding, see Louis CK about sucking on tits that have seen a few kids -- nothing better), and as long as you actually show sexual interest to your partner (don't confuse a hug or a kiss as sexual interest, you gotta make clear you're not looking for a cuddle -- cuddling's fine and all, but grab a dick sometimes) then you'll probably be fine.\n\nBut people are fickle, and the grass often looks greener.

Compromise, communication, and trust. This is all you need. If you're happy, then are attracted to the thing that made you happy. Sex is a way of showing affection. You ever notice in movies how friends who have something great happen to them, immediately give someone a hug? Well affection is a natural response to happiness. \n\nYou don't need a 2 headed, nuclear powered, dido swing with Bluetooth adapter to keep your man interested.

Personally I think that having too high expectations about what a relationship is supposed to be, is just as dangerous as falling into routines. Or worse. Probably a lot worse. Some people give up when the thrill of being in love fades. It was great for a while, and they thought that the feelings would linger, but they didn't. Also, every day wasn't a wonderful exiting day out of a fairy tale. (I'm exaggerating a bit, but you get the point.)  \n\nSo expect highs and lows. Communicate with each other about this. Say that you expect highs and lows, and talk about how you think you will deal with it.        \nAlso, learning to be content with the routinely parts of your relationship is important. Parts of life *is* boring, but as long as you break the routine once in a while, I think you'll be good. But breaking the routines all the time can't possibly work, because doing that will itself become the routine, and less exciting. Sort of like all the guys loving whenever women demonstrate their rights to be topless. It's awesome at first, but if women being topless became normal all the excitement about it would vanish. \n\nAnyways, if I would give a relationship advice with one word, it would be *communication.* Second word would be *openness*. Third: *compromise.* \n\n", "id": "cy2b7wu"}, {"comment": "Don't listen to these idiots and their sex-centric advice.

In fact, one of you will be better at one thing than the other and while it might not cause friction, slowing down or trying to keep up might degrade the experience. Instead, show genuine interest in his hobbies and introduce him to yours. Let him go and indulge in his hobbies that you don't actively follow.

She had these super baggy red sleeping shorts. She had a double room (so two twin beds) and she was the only one it thought.

And I would get so turned on, conversation would become difficult because I couldn't pay attention to words. Sometimes she would fall asleep, and I would stare at her vagina for an hour, and then go back to my room and masturbate.\n\nKind of creep in retrospect, but it happened probably 50 times, and I used to think about it often when I masturbated, but I hadn't thought of it in years. Thanks for bringing back an amazing memory.  Not having sex with her was such a huge regret from college. She had a boyfriend at a different university, and we were just friends. She had back issues from her giant breasts and asked me for massages all the time. They were more then \"just friends massages\" though. They went further and further each time. She would take off her shirt and just be wearing those baggy red shorts. I would spend an hour on her back, and do the sides of her torso and the sides of her breasts that were available, and I went under her shorts and would massage her buttocks and her inner thighs up a quarter inch from her vagina. A few times I even did rub her vulva under her short for a few minutes before she asked me to move on to her legs, or she would turn over still topless and I would do her full front body including breasts.\nNever did have sex with her though... so close so many times.", "id": "cyis676"}, {"comment": "You know she was intentional showing you her clam? right?", "id": "cyisme0"}, {"comment": "I agree, girls are pretty aware of when their naughty bits are showing.
