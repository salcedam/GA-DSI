My main (and frankly the only) inspiration for the creased and pulpy aesthetics of all the posters I've done so far is actually hand-painted Shaw Brothers Kungfu posters from the 70s!

Don't get me wrong, I love the way this poster looks overall and you've definitely captured that style.  I mess around with this painted technique a lot thanks to you.

No one's arguing that.\n\nAs someone who is a scientist who studies vultures, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls Condors Vultures. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"vulture family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Accipitridae, which includes things from kites to hawks to buzzards.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a Condor a Vulture is because random people \"call the scary ones vulture?\" Let's get harriers and large eagles in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A condor is a condor and a member of the vulture family. But that's not what you said. You said Condors are vultures, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call kites, harriers, and other raptors vultures, too. Which you said you don't.\n\nIt's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?\n\n[sauce] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2byyca/reddit_helps_me_focus_on_the_important_things/cjb37ee)\ncopypasta from unidan", "id": "d66rien"}, {"comment": "You dumb bastard.

I was going to have some pictures for you along with this list, but apparently paint.net forgets your history if you save a different picture. I really need to record my screen as I do this in the future :/ I have a screenshot of what it looked like before I blended and recolored it though, so I can give you a nice before/after. http://i.imgur.com/R0nq5ma.png\n\nStep 1: With careful use of the eraser, I cut out the dog's head and pasted it into a new layer. (I use a hardness of about 90% when I'm cutting out things)\n\nStep 2: I found the fruit bat image on google and copy/pasted it into a new layer underneath the dog's head. After that, I positioned and resized the dog's head over top of the bat's head.\n\nStep 3: Using a much bigger and much softer eraser (something like 300px wide with a hardness of around 40%) I went around the dog's neck and barely touched it with the eraser. I needed to do something like 5-6 passes to get it as blended as it is in the pic.\n\nStep 4: To recolor, I first used the colorpicker and sampled an orange spot on the bat's neck. Next, I adjusted the color's opacity to make the orange fairly transparent. I switched to the recolor tool and set the hardness to about 60% and the tolerance to around 40%. \n\nStep 5: I then used the recolor tool,but accidentally hit the wrong layer. I didn't mean to do it, but it made the bat's neck a more uniform orange, so I kept it.\n\nStep 6: I then switched to the correct layer with the dog's head and used the recolor tool on the white of the dog's chin to change it to that orangy color. I also used the recolor on the brown of the dog's neck.  I had to play with the tolerance for a while before it looked good, but I honestly can't remember what I set it to.\n\nStep 7: Finally, I played with the hue, saturation, brightness and contrast of the dog's head to really get it to match. Paint.net actually remembers my settings (shocker), so I can tell you I set the hue to 5, saturation to 105, brightness to 10, and contrast to -10.\n\nSorry I don't have screenshots, but I hope that helps!", "id": "d8odak7"}, {"comment": "Upvote for effort and good idea that is well executed!
