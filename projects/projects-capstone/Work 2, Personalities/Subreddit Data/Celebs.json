I think it was Hitchens that expounded upon how men just have a better acceptance that life is empirically unfair because it's easier to have offspring as a woman, male competition, yadda, yadda - he said it better of course. But...\n\nThrow in a poor acceptance of unfairness in the world, and the narcissism epidemic we seem to be going through in general, and you have the makings of a Tumblerista, etc. Ie; They feel *entitled* to have the rules not apply to them. \n\nThe only thing I find missing is the last sentence and comparison. Because a woman of equal success may not seek the same precise reward of a physically attractive mate, as opposed to a mentally attractive mate, to a woman. Instead of a \"super hot dude\" she just want's a sensitive guy that appreciates her, listens, and is okay with a take charge woman. This is kind of some Margaret Atwood shit but the idea being that now that women are gaining power the kind of men they attract and seek will not be exactly what a man in the same position she'd want. \n\nSo it all works out. *Provided* you bust your ass and quit blaming and whining on Tumblr. Does that make sense?\n\nI mean yeah, that rich women wouldn't mind an attractive man just as a rich man wouldn't mind a brainy talented wife. But neither are 1st priority. \n\nAnyways. Where a wealthy man may want a beautiful wife first and foremost. A wealthy woman may prioritize other things before looks. A poor but wildly talented musician/artist for instance?  He's a \"good listener\" and doesn't mind she wears the pants because his esteem has to do with his art and not income.

When you're attractive, especially at her level, your existence has significant challenges.

It has its perks, of course, but you know and resent that all this preferential treatment is due almost entirely to your looks, which you are slowly losing one day at a time and which you have to work to maintain, which by itself is taxing.

You can say she's not your cup of tea, that's fine. We all have our preferences. However, to deny her talent is simply being willfully obtuse. Chris Rock doesn't direct a special for someone he doesn't think is really funny.\n\nShe's won Emmys, has had greatly successful albums, an HBO special, her own sketch show that constantly goes viral, and has become an icon in pop culture. I prefer her 2013-album style in standup but it's fine she's going a little mainstream, she is getting to Seinfeld-level popularity (not that they are similar at all, their styles are very different IMO), so she might as well adapt to her crowd as one would one's constituents if one was a politician.\n\nBottom line she's objectively good as fuck. If you still don't like her, that's totally okay. We all have our own preferences. But to deny her talents is bullshit.\n\nAs an addendum, she also knows how to spot talent.

This is why you typically find wines that appear to be a couple years old on the shelves at your favourite retailer. The year on the bottle represents the vintage year, when the grapes were picked, not the year the wine was released.

I **never** listen to the radio. Most of my music is streamed to me from my Prime channels or from my own collection. There aren't many occasions when I would intentionally go someplace where I knew they played Katy Perry, Whitney Houston (I **hate** Whitney Houston), Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, or anything like that. Everything but Houston is all autotuned 2000s junk, if you ask me. \n\nAnd I've never, ever given a shit about what Billboard Magazine considered good enough to be a #1 single. Not in the 1970s. Not in the 1980s. Definitely not in the 1990s. Absolutely not in the 2000s. \n\nSo basically, you're telling me that if I were the kind of person who owned a Black Eyed Peas album, I'd be all over this Rita Ora's music. \n\nSo again, I say I never heard of her, and the first I've heard her name was when she decided to take off her shirt for a magazine and get posted on Reddit a bajillion times this week.

It can be a good burger, but it will never be something that ends up in the hall of fame of food, because you asked it to be quick and with easy to recognize flavours. Then of course, you can still make a burger so incredibly great that it's both a fast food and also appreciated by the experts, in that case you deserve it! (so you are right: you could have great art even with catchy lyrics and predictable music, see the Beatles for example)\n\nSaid that, I think there are some (implicit) rules to understand what is art and what is not. It has to be something that lot of people appreciate for their emotional power, and that has an innovative aspect in it. Millions of kids would be moved by jingle bells, but they will grow up and find it repetitive. Same things for fast food, we still consume it but our taste evolved. And so music that is designed to be consumed rapidly (except incredibly rare cases like the Beatles) will often be ignored by \"snobs\" that listen a lot of music, not as a background while they work, but as a main channel of communication with their soul.\nIn other words, if you can still work while you listen to it probably it's not moving you enough, and the best respect you can give to an artist is to listen to them, not reducing them as a mere background, like it was before Beethoven arrived.", "id": "czhdg3j"}, {"comment": "I'm having a hard time understanding how a singer that shows up to a studio, sings lyrics someone else wrote that she read for the first time that day, and then has a computer manipulate her voice, can be considered an \"artist\".\n\nSounds more like a day laborer.

She isn't exactly 'the face' of Coca-cola, is she? She basically took a job a page 3 model might get.

That's basically all that makes this an interesting photograph and for me that means it's not an interesting photograph. It's just a photograph of someone famous doing something a bit out of the ordinary. There's no contrast, no real composition and there's nothing that makes it unique. Every shoot he does with a celeb looks like this, except most of them are in colour (I chose this one as the comparison photo is also in black an white). He probably took 500-1000 images that day (I really hope he didn't take more, as it would just be a waste of data storage) just of her, so there's no element of the decisive moment, there's no sense that there was any skill to creating this image.

She appears to be lying down with a clenched fist over her arm, is she annoyed? Angry? Upset? Tempestuous? Sultry? There's also the shadow being cast against her, is that from a window? Where could she be? Essentially the photograph brings up a lot of questions that can't really be answered, but leave a lot to the audience to figure out and speculate on. There are no answers right or wrong and that's what makes for a good or even great photograph, that it asks questions that can't be answered.

Breast reductions can be performed on young people as long as the doctors determine that their breasts won't grow back.  \n\n2. There's almost no risk to having a breast reduction.  There's a bigger risk from the anesthesia or infection from improper cleaning (which can be avoided by several followup visits with your surgeon which they schedule with you ahead of time usually) than from the surgery itself.  \n\n3.  Breast reductions aren't approved for \"vanity\", they're approved because there's significant health drawbacks i.e. there is trouble breathing, excessive weight is causing a curvature of the spine, etc.  While plastic surgeons often do perform breast reductions, that's because they're pretty good at hiding the scars which is pretty often a concern.  \n\n4. If you have a \"mental disorder\" (i'm assuming you're referring to body dysphoric disorder or some type of eating disorder but honestly, take your pick) it immediately excludes you from consideration.  You have to show a history of steady, healthy weight loss (or simply maintaining a healthy weight) until you would be at a healthy weight if not for your breasts, and if they still haven't shrunk *then* you get the reduction.  \n\n5. \"Grow to adapt and support the weight\" you know how that happens?  The weight curves your spine permanently.  You can't just strap a fucking bowling ball to a baby's head and be like \"OH THEIR SKULL WILL GROW TO ADAPT AND SUPPORT THE WEIGHT\" that's not how this works.  \n\nIt's not shady, it's fucking standard medical practice for decades.
