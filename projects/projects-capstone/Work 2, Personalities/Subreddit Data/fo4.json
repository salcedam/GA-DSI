I saved the end of the main story for last, and when I finished it and realized I had all but 2 faction-related trophies and had finished every side quest in the game w/ one character, it was pretty disappointing, especially considering that in previous Bethesda games there weren't only more quests, but more ways to complete those quests - usually a good/evil option and sometimes also a neutral path. With Skyrim I'd never come close to experiencing all of the game's content w/ a single character, and many fans of the series consider Skyrim to be a step down from previous games in terms of variety of content (I'm not one of them).  When you add the much lower number of full-fledged quests to the lack of alternate paths to complete quests, there's a SIGNIFICANT reduction in the total amount of content. This is where the many gushing reviews start to become scary to long-time fans of the Fallout (and Elder Scrolls) series; when you're willing to accept less, you will receive less in the future.\n\nEven with more time spent playing Fallout 4 since launch compared to Skyrim by this point, much of that time has been spent with building settlements - a system of player-created content (and it might have a lot to do w/ the engine being more stable). That's why I found it so odd that in numerous interviews the devs mentioned that if they were gonna cut anything from FO4, it would have been settlement building; if settlement building was cut, playtime would be DRASTICALLY reduced and the overall dearth of developer-curated content would be much more noticeable, to the point you'd have to wonder what they were doing w/ all that time. There's no doubt the game would have benefitted from an even longer development cycle, even just a few months, & even just to clean up & flesh out the content that already exists.  \n\nI hope the DLC is more of an expansion to what is there than a series of small sandboxes. I've never been a big fan of the FO3/NV DLC that takes you to a new area disconnected from the main gameworld and story, and if Fallout 4 needs anything, it's fleshed out endgame & faction content (a bit like Broken Steel), and maybe even a new faction that allows for more specifically evil/chaotic/lawless content, rather than just morally ambiguous."], [100, "Finally.

I fucking massacred all gunners and nobody is there to take it back even though it's literally a month ago), University Point, Fairline Hill Estates, West Everett Estates, and go on. I think having 30-ish settlements is overkill too, wasting good locations for generic \"Kill ghouls on other side of the Commonwealth because they harass us\" quests. How nice the Castle is, I would've preferred much more if Preston became President and you his right hand, and he rebuilds the Castle to something neat. There's a general lack of well-made settlements from Bethesda in this game. Skyrim was strong in this as the world felt breathing and alive when you went from A to B, but somehow the Commonwealth feels even more like a barren wasteland than the Capital Wasteland, imho due to 30 pretty capable locations for NPC settlements which now are just generic settlements.\n\nI'm already spending most of my materials (and caps) on managing 3 locations, I want to be a visitor or honored guest in the 27 other locations.\n\nContrast:\n\nFallout 3 plenty of settlements you can visit which have their own right of existence.

I don't consider other one-family settlements or a small farm as a proper place to hang around at. It's all just so meh.

Some people say the game lacks detail, to which I say they've never taken a shot at a ghoul, only to realize those ghouls were attacking Gunners who are in a firefight with Super Mutants who are, for some reason, being attacked by three Yao Guai in downtown Boston (My current biggest WTF moment. Yao Guai not far from Goodneighbor. The hell is that?). \n\nThe game is fun. It's enjoyable. There is as much to do as you can make for yourself to do, which is why Bethesda games are so amazing. If you need a set of quests to string you along, you aren't playing the right kind of game. Fallout 4 is the most linear Bethesda game I've played to date, and it's still very much an open world. There is a ton of stuff you'd never find if you don't just wander around. The quests feel longer, to me, than they did in Skyrim. Go to Falkreath, meet a guy who needs help, dive into dungeon for a mystical treasure, return it. Meh. Fallout does have quests like that, sure, but those are mostly for us who want to go as slowly as possible. \n\nI don't mind setting up 37 MILA's, or hunting haptic crap for Scribe Haylen until I'm level 50. Hell, I don't even mind rescuing kidnapped settlers for the 17th time. Because playing the game is more fun than completing quests. I don't mind those things because I live for the chance to get into an insane firefight with three factions and a bear. \n\n\nBethesda tried some new stuff this time around. They aren't done yet. We haven't even begun to explore mods on console. I don't know when that's coming, but I'm pretty stoked for it. It's a bigger deal than people are acting like it will be. It won't be perfect at first, sure. But it's a massive step in bringing consoles to a competitive level with PC's on a scale that isn't based on performance. If they can make it work for Fallout, more and more developers will get in on it. Every time I mention console mods, I get downvoted to fuck. Why, I don't know. But it's potentially a literal game-changer, and I don't see many people talking about it. Settlement building also needs work, yes, but I think most of us enjoy the hell out of it anyway. I know I do. In a game like Fallout, being able to alter parts of the world is a pretty big deal to me, and from here it can only get better. \n\nI feel like a lot of people are holding Bethesda to a benchmark. \"They did X well in this game, next time it should be better.\" Ever done a good job at work, and your boss is all proud and happy with you, until it needs done again and he expects even more and acts disappointed? Makes you feel a little bit shit, yeah? That's how a lot of people are acting towards Bethesda right now. Skyrim was good, Fallout 4 automatically has to be a bajillion times better. It can't just be a good game in it's own right, no, it has to be better. Because gamers are fickle as shit sometimes.\n\n**TL;DR - Fallout 4 is fun, Skyrim was fun. You don't like giving an inch and being taken for a mile, stop doing it to Bethesda. If the game wasn't good, it would make sense, however the biggest argument seems to be that it isn't as good as previous titles.

Far fewer quests, with some admittedly unique ones that are drowned by the immense number of throwaway, radiant quests. Gun customization while cool, isn't enough to make me consider turning the game on again. I feel like Bethesda expected everyone to bumble around with the settlement building to extend playtime. They rely far too heavily on radiant quests and the veil is quickly lifted when you've saved the same settlement from ghouls or raiders 20+ times.\n\n\n Radiant quests were a cop out in Skyrim, and when used in full force in F4, I can only feel like I'm just padding out time. At this point I'm waiting for the Creation Kit to be released so we can get some really nice mods out there, because after completing the main story and derping with settlement stuff for another 5 to 10 hours or so, I made a new character that I have no intention of really doing much with because it will be a carbon copy of my last playthrough."], [18, "Ya, as much as I love Fallout 4, it's not as fun as Skyrim.\n\nI've put 200+ hours into Skyrim, but I still feel like there's hundreds of hours of shit I haven't done yet.\n\nNot to mention all the different styles of characters.

If not you'll need to dispatch the deathclaw and recover the Brahmin (or any remains).\n\n* Reinforce: A squad of initiates has been ambushed and pinned down while on a mission to secure X. Get down to the battle line and help them fight off the attackers. Once you have the upper hand, help them advance to the objective and secure X.\n\n* Overwatch: There's been some suspicious activity at the intersection of X and X.

Clear the supply line and use supplies from the depot to reinforce the defenses. \n\n* Power Station: The controls for the Eastern quadrant of the city's power grid are located in a heavily fortified building that sits in the center of a combat zone. Every time we get pushed out we lose power. We are sending you with a team to take back control of the power station and install bypass systems so if we lose control, we will still get power until they discover our bypasses.

Look at the Minutemen -- they have a colorful history, they're trying to rebuild, and there's a lot of buttery drama related to their recent shitstorm in Quincy.

Sure, relative to their last fallout game made in 2006 with invisible walls goddamn everywhere the game feels expansive. But judging it as Bethesda's next big title, since that's how they hyped it up to be, it's a pretty big step back from Skyrim in terms of expansion. I can realistically see where they spent the time, adding ingredient values to almost every item in the game as well as making a building and design system in real game time is a huge difference to the Hearthfire DLC, but it just doesn't extend the longevity of the game for the average player as much, relative to the systems new to Skyrim.\n\nYes, almost every quest in almost every RPG ends up being extremely formulaic, but I cared about going into dungeon #247 to retrieve artifact #302 when the reasons for doing so were adequate.

Maybe you become a vampire from one of the 3 clans...now the world is out to kill you because the undead is the among the most insulting types of creature in Dunmer culture because of how they honor their dead ancestors.\n\nFurthermore, let's say you decided to join the Mages Guild.  In Skyrim you can be a level 1 warrior and become archmage.  But back in Morrowind, you can't rank up until your skills match the requirements for that rank. So it's probably going to be some time before you become anyone of notoriety.  Also, don't forget to pay your guild dues. Now that I bring up ranking, you can't become the \"top dog\" in a lot of the factions anyway.  You get promoted to Operative of the Blades in the Main Quest, but the guy who promotes you tells you that he THINKS that makes you the ranking member in Vvardenfell but there's no way for him to be sure.  Ashlanders you can only become a Clanfriend, why would they make you anything else when you're an outlander and don't belong to the tribe?\n\nI replay Morrowind all the time and I could tell you that the love a lot of people have for this game isn't just rooted in empty nostalgia, though that is there.

I can do this fancy settlement with all the luxuries that any other city in the game has, and nothing really comes from it. The unnamed settlers that go there don't use the facilities like I do. They don't really go and get drinks, sit down, chat, have dinner, go relax in their homes or rooms, work like they work in places like Diamond City. It feels empty.\n\nThey really need to let you designate areas of the settlement as certain things. Places to eat, places to relax and have fun, work spaces, food production, people need to work on maitenance (even if it is just cosmetic and nothing gets fixed truly), it needs to feel alive. Having people stand around and do nothing doesn't make it feel alive. They need to dynamically be set a routine that they stick to until something changes in the settlement to change that routine. New restaurant? Maybe they start going there. New barber? Now they can occasionally go change their hair. New toilet block? They go there occasionally and USE the facilities. It needs to feel alive.\n\nIf I knew how to code shit in the GECK (when it comes out) or do modelling and such, I would go nuts working on improving this kind of stuff. The most impressive mods for me are always things that expand immersion and the living world of a game, not new guns, not fancy weird clothes, not turning shit into Macho Man... things that make me believe I am in this world.\n\nAt the moment, this game fails massively.

I saved the end of the main story for last, and when I finished it and realized I had all but 2 faction-related trophies and had finished every side quest in the game w/ one character, it was pretty disappointing, especially considering that in previous Bethesda games there weren't only more quests, but more ways to complete those quests - usually a good/evil option and sometimes also a neutral path. With Skyrim I'd never come close to experiencing all of the game's content w/ a single character, and many fans of the series consider Skyrim to be a step down from previous games in terms of variety of content (I'm not one of them).  When you add the much lower number of full-fledged quests to the lack of alternate paths to complete quests, there's a SIGNIFICANT reduction in the total amount of content. This is where the many gushing reviews start to become scary to long-time fans of the Fallout (and Elder Scrolls) series; when you're willing to accept less, you will receive less in the future.\n\nEven with more time spent playing Fallout 4 since launch compared to Skyrim by this point, much of that time has been spent with building settlements - a system of player-created content (and it might have a lot to do w/ the engine being more stable). That's why I found it so odd that in numerous interviews the devs mentioned that if they were gonna cut anything from FO4, it would have been settlement building; if settlement building was cut, playtime would be DRASTICALLY reduced and the overall dearth of developer-curated content would be much more noticeable, to the point you'd have to wonder what they were doing w/ all that time. There's no doubt the game would have benefitted from an even longer development cycle, even just a few months, & even just to clean up & flesh out the content that already exists.  \n\nI hope the DLC is more of an expansion to what is there than a series of small sandboxes. I've never been a big fan of the FO3/NV DLC that takes you to a new area disconnected from the main gameworld and story, and if Fallout 4 needs anything, it's fleshed out endgame & faction content (a bit like Broken Steel), and maybe even a new faction that allows for more specifically evil/chaotic/lawless content, rather than just morally ambiguous.", "id": "cxyghe0"}, {"comment": "I only realised it just now, but it's right.

I know there weren't a huge number of quests, but there were almost always at least 2 ways to complete them, with sometimes vastly different results.

I remember the \"evil\" or alternative path to complete side quests was not always all that well fleshed out - it was an option, but sometimes it was bugged or incomplete, didn't have an equal reward, etc. - but instead of improving that, they mostly did away with it.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, it's not the number of quests that's important (though I'd like to see more - and in the current gameworld, not a DLC add-on) but the quality, length, and multiple possible outcomes. It seems in FO4 that quests are fairly short, linear, & virtually all of the decision making comes down to your choice of faction; once you choose a faction, unless you do the quests in a certain order to exploit the system, you don't get to choose how the story resolves, your only available choice is to completely decimate at least 2 of the other factions (which is weird b/c the story requires you to be mostly heroic, then forces you to become a mass murderer).", "id": "cxykbxa"}, {"comment": "In relation to this it kind of forces the dialogue choices to be completely meaningless.

Yao Guai not far from Goodneighbor. The hell is that?). \n\nThe game is fun. It's enjoyable. There is as much to do as you can make for yourself to do, which is why Bethesda games are so amazing. If you need a set of quests to string you along, you aren't playing the right kind of game. Fallout 4 is the most linear Bethesda game I've played to date, and it's still very much an open world. There is a ton of stuff you'd never find if you don't just wander around. The quests feel longer, to me, than they did in Skyrim. Go to Falkreath, meet a guy who needs help, dive into dungeon for a mystical treasure, return it. Meh. Fallout does have quests like that, sure, but those are mostly for us who want to go as slowly as possible. \n\nI don't mind setting up 37 MILA's, or hunting haptic crap for Scribe Haylen until I'm level 50. Hell, I don't even mind rescuing kidnapped settlers for the 17th time. Because playing the game is more fun than completing quests. I don't mind those things because I live for the chance to get into an insane firefight with three factions and a bear. \n\n\nBethesda tried some new stuff this time around. They aren't done yet. We haven't even begun to explore mods on console. I don't know when that's coming, but I'm pretty stoked for it. It's a bigger deal than people are acting like it will be. It won't be perfect at first, sure. But it's a massive step in bringing consoles to a competitive level with PC's on a scale that isn't based on performance. If they can make it work for Fallout, more and more developers will get in on it. Every time I mention console mods, I get downvoted to fuck. Why, I don't know. But it's potentially a literal game-changer, and I don't see many people talking about it. Settlement building also needs work, yes, but I think most of us enjoy the hell out of it anyway. I know I do. In a game like Fallout, being able to alter parts of the world is a pretty big deal to me, and from here it can only get better. \n\nI feel like a lot of people are holding Bethesda to a benchmark. \"They did X well in this game, next time it should be better.\" Ever done a good job at work, and your boss is all proud and happy with you, until it needs done again and he expects even more and acts disappointed? Makes you feel a little bit shit, yeah? That's how a lot of people are acting towards Bethesda right now. Skyrim was good, Fallout 4 automatically has to be a bajillion times better. It can't just be a good game in it's own right, no, it has to be better. Because gamers are fickle as shit sometimes.\n\n**TL;DR - Fallout 4 is fun, Skyrim was fun. You don't like giving an inch and being taken for a mile, stop doing it to Bethesda.

The Raiders will be back soon, so stick around and make sure the supply line isn't attacked before they can get up and running.\n\n* Classic escort: so-and-so has information valuable to the Brotherhood and the Institute. Help the Railroad sneak the VIP across town to a safehouse near X. Expect both factions to be patrolling the area. If you can instigate a fight between them somehow, sneaking past should be easier. OR, so-and-so is an agent of the [faction] and has been captured while trying to disrupt our activities. He is being held in a basement at [location] by two of our guys. The area is heavily patrolled, so get in there quietly and get our team, and the captured soldier, out safely.\n\n* Search and rescue: So-and-So's Brahmin got out of its pen and wandered toward a cave we believe houses a Deathclaw. If you get there in time you can lure the Brahmin back to the farm for an XP/Caps bonus. If not you'll need to dispatch the deathclaw and recover the Brahmin (or any remains).\n\n* Reinforce: A squad of initiates has been ambushed and pinned down while on a mission to secure X. Get down to the battle line and help them fight off the attackers. Once you have the upper hand, help them advance to the objective and secure X.\n\n* Overwatch: There's been some suspicious activity at the intersection of X and X. We believe a pack of super mutants has been setting traps across the road. There's a tower a block and a half away that provides a view of the entire area. Find out what is going on, and eliminate any threats. You can take them down yourself, or report back and we will send a team. \n\n* Phoenix: We've run critically low on components essential to the Vertibird navigation systems because the supply line to the storage depot has been compromised. Clear the supply line and use supplies from the depot to reinforce the defenses. \n\n* Power Station: The controls for the Eastern quadrant of the city's power grid are located in a heavily fortified building that sits in the center of a combat zone. Every time we get pushed out we lose power. We are sending you with a team to take back control of the power station and install bypass systems so if we lose control, we will still get power until they discover our bypasses. As long as we have power, you will be rewarded. \n\n* Sabotage - The [faction] are allies, and good ones at that, but they have something we need, and if they find out we took it all hell will break loose. Sneak in and take it, or disguise yourself as a rival faction and fight your way in.

Look at the Minutemen -- they have a colorful history, they're trying to rebuild, and there's a lot of buttery drama related to their recent shitstorm in Quincy.

Todd Howard said it was hard to tell because there was more vertical space, but with all the cliffs and mountains in Skyrim, as well as a cave or dungeon every couple steps, there's no way that the empty rooftops of Boston, only accessible through scaffolding or jetpacks, count as livable space. \n\nOf course fans are going to compare the next game by the same company even if it wasn't the same franchise.

But judging it as Bethesda's next big title, since that's how they hyped it up to be, it's a pretty big step back from Skyrim in terms of expansion. I can realistically see where they spent the time, adding ingredient values to almost every item in the game as well as making a building and design system in real game time is a huge difference to the Hearthfire DLC, but it just doesn't extend the longevity of the game for the average player as much, relative to the systems new to Skyrim.\n\nYes, almost every quest in almost every RPG ends up being extremely formulaic, but I cared about going into dungeon #247 to retrieve artifact #302 when the reasons for doing so were adequate.

The fact that we're forced to have either some white guy or white lady be our voice when not all of us are white or want our characters sound life that makes this game lesser than those other games. Nate and Nora should have been side characters.\n\nI'm tired of the excuse \"wewanted to tell a story\". Tell your story in a linear video game. People want to make their own story in these games. In Skyrim, I've made characters that are either regular non special hunters, demon slayers, traveling bards that don't fight, healers spreading th word of Mara, and petty thieves.

Every person has a parent, not every one has or wants a child.\n\nThe thing that really really hurts this game though is the voiced main character. Why? because mods can't effectively make questlines. They'll have to make the character silent, or stitch together lines of dialog. There will be no way to maintain any quality PC dialog  with mods. We can use the silent PC mod, sure, but if you've paid any amount of attention to this game, you'll notice that the dialog doesn't always show up when characters speak including your own character. Mods can cut out the extremely mediocre main story with some effort. They can make alternate starts and cut out any mentions of a son or a spouse. they can add new dialog unless the voice actors for the male and female PC just feel like doing volunteer voice work for quest mods that people want to make.\n\nLike I said, the game good, great even.

They can reuse the old objects and tools.\n\nFor the second reason we'll use the vehicle example.

If you do it that way, you just have to set \"enable_flight\" to \"true\" in the *vehicle* class, and the car and truck objects get the new property automatically. \n\nOf course, in the real world, these design patterns are poorly adhered to, so you get situations where you have to shoehorn a train body onto an NPC class. \n", "id": "d7w3mqr"}, {"comment": "There's also the fact that it was only needed for one scene (which IIRC we don't even really interact with), so they just shoehorned it as an NPC to avoid having to create a \"vehicle\" class at all, \n\nNow that we actually have vehicles like the vertibird or the boat, they likely wouldn't do that in similar situations in the future.\n\nNow if only we got more directly controllable vehicles, like in Witcher 3.

The green box is  a trigger than [has this script attached to it](https://i.imgur.com/3n8C2a9.png).

It then waits until the player actually looks at the ghouls before playing the 'incoming train' sound and starts counting down. Once the timer expires the train then plays the forward animation and impacts the ghouls.\n\nThe train itself [has this script attached](https://i.imgur.com/vj9DPiu.png), and all that does is kill/dismember the ghouls when it touches them then force them to go flying.\n\nNow regarding the train hat, it's only used on the player under two specific circumstances, both regarding the player riding the metro. [Here is the script that is attached to one of the metro car switch. This one in particular handles the player riding to Adam's Air Force Base](http://pastebin.com/mfPQHFE7).

A common example I give is Lucy West in FO3, when you first meet her she's looking for her brother who she left in Arefu. You have no reason to care, most of the time you're just starting out so you just do it for the extra caps, but upon doing so you open up a bigger quest line with the Family at which point you have a choice on how to deal with the Family.\n\nNV, on the other hand, just has NPCs sitting around waiting for you to give you quests, like whatshisface in the White Glove Society casino looking for his son. He's already sitting there apparently asking anyone who comes by about his missing son. There's no sense of discovery, you immediately know something's up with the White Glove Society and you're given zero reason to care about this dude's son.\n\nThe only thing that makes this pedestrian quest interesting is the variable ways you can approach it but that in of itself doesn't make a great quest.\n\nThis formula is repeated again and again throughout NV. And don't even get me started on the main quest... again you're given very little reason to care over who takes over the strip or Hoover dam. At least Fallout 4, each faction is written in a way that gives them a raison d'etre: the Railroad wants to free synths who they see as sentient beings worthy of human rights, the BoS believes that technology must be controlled and that abominations like synths and ghouls (even non-hostile ones) must be destroyed and the Institute wants to save humanity from itself even if that means redefining what it means to be human.

I can fuck around easily in Skyrim or Fallout, and the world is built around that, then I can take it seriously in a different save file. You can end a conversation and just kill most quest givers if you felt like it, and there are a ton of dynamic sandbox features that create some pretty wacky scenarios. That's the heart of Bethesda gaming, it just sucks to see them focus on turning into a genre genre filtered GTA when their licensed universes that fans have loved for decades have a ton of potential to make something like the witcher or bioware's games, with the freedom of choice, if they just put a bit more effort into the detail of everything.", "id": "dahswzt"}, {"comment": "> I've heard people say Bethesda excels at world building, but I can't find out what they mean by that.\n\nYes, Bethesda's worldbuilding, at least in Elder Scrolls, is top notch.\n\n> If it's the lore, it's terribly inconsistent between games\n\nI'm not quite sure what you mean by that, because in TES the lore is meant to be somewhat inconsistent, as it's all basically being told by unreliable narrators. A good example would be the transformation of Trinimac into Malacath. The belief is that Boethiah ate Trinimac and excreted the dung, which became Malacath. But if you talk to Boethiah they say it's not quite as literal. But they're also the daedric prince of deceit, so who knows what the real story is.\n\nAnd it works, because in real life history isn't written from a neutral point of view. Take a look at Columbus, or the Pilgrims, or colonial America. It's the \"history is written by the victors\" saying.\n\n> if it's the NPCs and towns, it suffers the \"world revolves around you\" bit, \n\nNot sure what you mean about this either, are you talking about how everyone comes to you for help and such? I mean, in every TES game you are \"the chosen one that comes from humble roots\" which yes is an overused trope, but I feel they do it better than others, and in an RPG it's important to make your character feel \"special\".\n\n> and if it's the world space itself, it just doesn't feel real like the witcher did (no really, check out \"walk the walk\" series on it, they put an insane amount of detail into even the roads and a bunch of other things that will never get noticed)\n\nI haven't played through the witcher series yet (definitely next on my list though) so I can't comment on that... but yes, there are times where the world space doesn't feel real.", "id": "dai03w5"}, {"comment": "> Lore\n\nWith TES, it's meant to be like that, like you said. There's a few differences in the games we can just say is apart of the games, and they had to retcon a few things so you can play every race.

You'll walk into a village, hear the chatter from people to gather story, and unless you approach them for something, they'll ignore you. Morrowind made you earn your rep, although not even being able to use the vendors was kind of annoying.\n\n> World Space\n\nDude, I freaking love the witcher's world design. As someone who has done a lot of hiking in their life, it felt like I was walking around in the woods a lot.

Even when bouncing between serious and lighthearted sections, there is still a consistent \"feel\"(I am incompetent and can't think of a better word for it). A good game might make you feel differently from start to beginning, but it should still feel like every bit belongs in the game. \n\nAnother bit is all of those little stories that they don't spoon feed you. To me this is where Bethesda excels. For example, you can find a partially destroyed building across the street from a taller building which you can jump from. If you jump into the shorter building, there are dead bodies hanging on the ledge and littering the street below, almost as if they had tried to make the jump themselves.

I think most people connect opera with lady singing in that certain style, not actually the play itself. This is only natural since all they hear and remember from opera is that voice/style, so then that's opera to them.\n\nAs for metal, yes it is still rock, but you could argue opera is also classical music.

They do have lights which are powered by a conduit in close proximity, but as far as I know those are all powered by conduits just above the door frame in the hallway, and no wires actually run into those rooms.\n\nThere's wires running all through the castle halls, but that all starts with one switch in the courtyard with one wire that runs through a permanent wall into the Castle halls, but that wire isn't truly even clipped through the wall, that wall is a wood wall with multiple gaps between boards and the wire runs right through a hole. It may be \"clipped\" in the sense that the game may not actually let you place a wire quite like that yourself, but it is passing through a hole that you can see clear through and isn't passing through an actual solid wall.\n\nSimilarly, there is power running from in the Castle to outside the castle walls, through the Castle walls, but that goes through a port hole in the brick and again not through anything actually solid. Far as I know those two points are the only two places where power is going through any otherwise solid walls and it is done with wires and all through actual gaps in walls.\n\nI will definitely try the light trick out though. I feel like I have placed conduits in there in such a way that I would have gotten them powered if this did work. I didn't know of this specifically before but I did try putting a conduit on the inside door frame, exactly in the same spot as the powered conduit on the other side of the wall on the same door frame, thinking possibly it might connect them through the wall if they were placed directly opposite each other like that. That didn't work, but there were a number of those lights which don't need direct wiring in the area so I would think that if that worked that it would have happened then even though I was trying something completely different.

Despite having about 150 hours in the game I really haven't spent much time on more advanced settlement building so I have a lot of tricks to still figure out. I built the bare minimum to keep settlements from being short food/water/defence/etc but held off doing anything too major until I found a settlement I really wanted to build up. \n\nSince you seem to know what you're doing, I have one other question. If you build something at one settlement, is there any way to transfer it to another settlement? There doesn't seem to be any option to take settlement items into your inventory (which makes sense, I wouldn't expect to) but they also don't seem to be available to place when you are in the workshop in another settlement. \n\nI could, and probably will, just scrap whatever I have stored that I won't use at the settlement it's in, but I just was not totally sure if that is an option and I've somehow missed it. I have a fair amount of electric connectors that became redundant when changing layout and I'm very short on ceramic because it wasn't until well over 100 hours in that I realized ceramic was used for power devices and I just had never bothered to collect much of it for the first 100+ hours, so if there were a way to use those conduits I have sitting in the workshop at another settlement that would be ideal while I build up my collection of coffee mugs.\n\nI'd guess that there isn't a way to do this but I've found out about so many little tricks or things I wasn't aware of previously in the past couple weeks that it's hard to not assume I'm just missing something.", "id": "czxq2m8"}, {"comment": "Anything that you build at a settlement, and \"store,\" will only be available at that settlement, afaik, regardless of supply lines.\n\nWhen you scrap something, you get such an abysmal fraction of the materials back, and generally never any of the actually rare materials, that it's almost never worth it.  So when it comes to deciding to scrap/store something in a settlement, my rule of thumb is generally \"If there is *any* chance that I might use it again, just store it.\"", "id": "czxqqmi"}, {"comment": "Yeah, that's exactly why I have stored that stuff because I know I won't get anything worthwhile scrapping it. \n\nOh well, at this point I've played so long while building so little that I have a ridiculous amount of even most of the rarer components that I might use. It is really just ceramic where I'm short because I just ignored it for so long. \n\nAs I started seeing components like fibre optics and circuitry, which I had seen very little of earlier in the game and which just sound more valuable, I would tag those and pick them up even though I had no current use for them. Ceramic was just one of those things that seemed to be so common right from the start that I didn't bother with it, figuring I'd end up with enough over time and not knowing that it was used so much in electrical. \n\nAs it turns out it seems there's just not all that much junk that has ceramic as one of many components and since I ignored everything that was ceramic only, I just never really ended up piling that up like I did most other common components.", "id": "czxr59j"}, {"comment": "Same here man.

Today you'd reload by (roughly):\n\n* Remove spent primer from brass\n* Insert new primer\n* Insert *precise* amount of powder\n* Seat bullet to a specific depth\n* Crimp brass around bullet\n\nProblems that can occur and are deadly in combat situations:\n\n* Too little powder = squib load. Bullet fires, but gets stuck in barrel from lack of powder burn. Next round fired will explode barrel, gun, and possibly user. \n* Too much powder = too much boom. Causes excess stress on internal mechanisms. Possible catastrophic failure\n* Poor primer or powder = no bang. Petroleum oils, water, or even age can ruin primers and powder to be as useful as dirt. No bang in a gunfight means you're up a creek without a paddle. \n\nPowder and primer is the main issue with the realism. After 200 years it's impossible for their to be any raw materials left. Even if you found some you'd have to be careful with transport as a crack in the contained can ruin your whole supply.

You use so much force that you pick them up and then just drop them. It's really cool and must be terrifying for the raider. They'll be shooting at you with Pipe Pistols, Hunting Rifles and Double barrels but it doesn't even faze you as you walk up to them, bullets bouncing off your armor and just impale them with a Tire Iron. That's why I want to see it in first person, to see the terror on their faces.If you run at them without PA you do a spinning jump slash which is sweet. There's also one where you just hack at their head and torso multiple times. You can also block at the right time and stagger kick them or choke slam them which is so so satisfying.\n\nHave you tried bashing a Raider at the right time in first person? You cave their heads in with the gun butt. It's kind of like that. I really like the finishers but the best ones are in Third Person and Third Person can be atrocious for aiming; sometimes because of the angles you can't see yourself do the full finisher. I wish the camera would just zoom out when you initiate a finisher so you could see it.\n\nI also wish there were more animations in general and more unique animations depending on your weapon mods because there are some cool weapon mods.

He was previously a healthy, normal weight basset hound, named Buddy. The sickness took hold of him fairly quickly and in the end he couldn't keep anything down and he knew he was dying, you could tell in how he acted.\n\nDogs will commonly try to find somewhere to hide and die alone, but not Buddy. He loved his family (My wife, kids and myself) so he tried to constantly be around us in the end. See, we rescued him, we never knew for sure but we suspect he was abused in how he acted when scolded or if anyone was yelling around him.\n\nThe time came that we had to do something. He had lost over 30 pounds in under a week and a half. The problem was, we were flat broke. We couldn't afford treatment for him, and honestly it most likely wouldn't have done anything but prolonged his suffering regardless.\n\nSo I had to borrow money from my best friend to have my dog put down and out of his misery. Said friend just ended up giving me the money, and took me to the vet with him. We had him put down, and I stood there as it happened and held his paw. He was shaking and looked very scared, but it took hold quickly and he was gone within less than a full minute.\n\nAgain, I had no money. I couldn't even afford to have the vet office cremate him. so I had to have him wrapped in a goddamn garbage bag...and we took him out into a clearing of woods (I too live in a city, but fuck it.) to bury him. It started raining almost as soon as we actually set foot in the woods so I was there with two friends digging a grave for my dog whom I rescued from abuse...who was wrapped in a trash bag. It started pouring quickly, making the digging hard as we kept losing footing and almost sliding into the hole.

He was previously a healthy, normal weight basset hound, named Buddy. The sickness took hold of him fairly quickly and in the end he couldn't keep anything down and he knew he was dying, you could tell in how he acted.\n\nDogs will commonly try to find somewhere to hide and die alone, but not Buddy. He loved his family (My wife, kids and myself) so he tried to constantly be around us in the end. See, we rescued him, we never knew for sure but we suspect he was abused in how he acted when scolded or if anyone was yelling around him.\n\nThe time came that we had to do something. He had lost over 30 pounds in under a week and a half. The problem was, we were flat broke. We couldn't afford treatment for him, and honestly it most likely wouldn't have done anything but prolonged his suffering regardless.\n\nSo I had to borrow money from my best friend to have my dog put down and out of his misery. Said friend just ended up giving me the money, and took me to the vet with him. We had him put down, and I stood there as it happened and held his paw. He was shaking and looked very scared, but it took hold quickly and he was gone within less than a full minute.\n\nAgain, I had no money. I couldn't even afford to have the vet office cremate him. so I had to have him wrapped in a goddamn garbage bag...and we took him out into a clearing of woods (I too live in a city, but fuck it.) to bury him. It started raining almost as soon as we actually set foot in the woods so I was there with two friends digging a grave for my dog whom I rescued from abuse...who was wrapped in a trash bag. It started pouring quickly, making the digging hard as we kept losing footing and almost sliding into the hole. We finally finished, said a few words and moved on.\n\n\nHonestly, one of the shittiest days of my 32 years of life. RIP Buddy.

FO4 has more interesting dungeon layouts and, more often than not, has a story attached to it. Not to say that Skyrim didn't have cool dungeons and stories attached to them, it just felt more well done than Skyrim.\n\nAlthough I'd argue that it has less to do with the universe each game is placed, and more so that Bethesda is learning what works well from each new release.

It's in our nature to be violent so no one is going to be all hunky dory with you?\n\n\nActually, fixing up the place would help increase your chance of survival because, hey, better security/fortification. Hence why throughout history, people have built increasingly advanced fortresses. Also, it's not really in our nature to be violent. At least, not in the sense of going around mass-murdering people to survive. My first thought after civilization falls apart wouldn't be \"Hey I should go kill some people for their stuff!\", it'd be more like \"Shit I better find some people that could help me stay alive. Plus they might share some stuff too\". People can't just automatically will themselves to murder other human beings, it's more likely they'd begin banding together to remain safe. If people naturally slaughter each other for survival, how would civilization have even formed in the first place?\n\n\nThe whole state-of-nature thing is based off Hobbesian philosophy which has no scientific basis to it other than what he observed in the English Civil War. Look at events like the Siege of Sarajevo. People's homes were bombed to oblivion, resources were dwindling, and everyone was forced into a state of survival/nature. What did they do? They helped each other out and shared resources. It's in our nature to help each other out because that quite literally increases our chances of survival. Plus, it helps restart society, which gives us security and even better chances of survival. \n\n\nI love fiction like *Fallout*, *Mad Max*, *Metro*, etc. But realistically, none of that stuff would ever happen. If civilization ever did shut down, it would just start popping back up again, probably in smaller, separate bodies with no unification, but no one would revert back to a savage-tribal state. Look at what happened when the Western Roman Empire fell- all of their previous entities that they were made up of formed their own kingdoms and empires. No one became savage psychopaths.

Where everyone knows everything about everyone. This is still aplicable now, and it sure as hell is aplicable in Fallout's universe.\n\n\nWhy am I explaining this? Isolation. Just imagine how small families or towns have their own lingo.

Italy, much smaller than the US, and despite having a standardized language, and all their dialects being based on vulgar latin, are so unlike each other. \n\n\n\nI know that the Sicilians also ignore some letters or change them, for example \"and it rains\", \"E piove\", becomes \"e chiove\". \"Black hand\", \"mano nera\", becomes \"Manu niura\". I know this from the internet from the small country of Honduras. Without the internet, cars, phones, etc., how would a newborn angeleno, who was raised on the radioactive dust of a farm, and who no doubt must have been brought into that zone's dialect, understand what the hell \"Wicked\" means? How would a Chicagoan know what the idiom \"butter my butt and call me a biscuit\" means? And this with an education system that ensures people at least learn some standardized english.\n\n\nAnother example would be towns within London. Yup, a single city. I can't do it, but I've read here in reddit that some natives to London know wether you come from a certain neighborhood just by how you speak. Neighborhoods, not cities, not regions or states, neighborhoods.\n\n\nWith so little communication (couple of radio stations at most, no TV, a handful of schools), the US would have many different dialects.\n\n\nI imagine that the remaining robots help keep some words through generations, but not every town and village has a robot.", "id": "d1jhem9"}, {"comment": "Chicagoan here.

Similarly, language also undergoes mutations, though the changes propagate much faster than in the evolution example.\n\nTake the Japanese language as an example.

The bad thing is, you're poisoning yourself and trying not to die before your cancer does.\n\nIn radiation therapy, they use gamma rays that are individually not strong enough to burn away cells (on a large enough scale that is, it's still not healthy). Multiple beams are crossed through the cancer cells, and only where the beams cross is the intensity enough to burn away cells. This therapy is more commonly used when the cancer hasn't spread and the affected tissue is in a hard to operate place like in the brain.\n\nYou will not lose hair from radiation therapy.

Chemotherapy is what we call a \"systemic therapy,\" it works by killing cells of all types in hopes of killing the cancer cells. Most people with cancer who are bald and look so sickly, usually do so because of chemo. \n\nNow radiation therapy CAN still cause hair loss, but it's localized to the area being treated. If you're being treated for a brain tumor and receiving radiation therapy, it's likely that you will experience some hair loss after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment. Each cell type in the body has its own threshold at which it dies from radiation.\n\nAlso as a side note, gamma radiation is only one method of radiation therapy and is typically reserved for small brain lesions. The majority of radiation therapy is performed using high-powered x-ray photons. These x-rays are generated using a linear accelerator (no live sources) and are collimated through the use of multi-leaf collimators. Essentially, these are what shape the beam of x-rays to fit the size and shape of the tumor volume.

Rapidly dividing cells include cancerous cells but also include bone marrow and blood precursors, skin, hair, nails, and the epithelial linings of tube organ systems like your GI tract, urinary system, respiratory tract, etc. The reason your hair falls out, though, is because of a phenomenon called telogen effluvium, and it's a response to a major stressor. Chemo is a major stressor, but so are things like burns and sepsis, which can also make hair fall out.

Have the option to take her home to a settlement (similar to adoption in Skyrim's Hearthstone DLC), or leave her there for her father to return.

That makes 3 decidedly gifted, 5 genius, and 10 super-human.\n\n**edit--**\n\nAlright you cheeky bastards, let's look at this from another angle. The Vault Tec Rep gives you the form, so you can declare what your special stats are. Implying that, no, they have not been at one all your life. 7 stats. 28 available Special points, one of which are assigned to each stat by default. That makes it impossible to set every stat at five, the previous precedent for \"average.\" At best, you can set every stat at ~~three~~ four. Or, \"[two] tick[s] above a monkey,\" as /u/stormpilgrim puts it. So, maybe ~~three~~ four is actually the new precedent for \"Average...\"\n\nExcept, let's look at what a character can do with just 4 in every stat:\n\n**Strength**\n\n* Become a champion unarmed fighter\n* Become an expert melee weapon fighter\n* Craft expert modifications for armor\n* Craft expert modifications for melee and unarmed weapons\n\n**Perception**\n\n* Become a master pickpocket\n* Become a master rifleman\n* Casually perceive health and damage resistance of anything you look at\n* Become a master lockpick\n\n**Endurance**\n\n* Shake off up to fifty points of damage (for reference, most pipe pistols and 10 mm's will cap at 40 ish on normal difficulty, even with every rank of gun slinger)\n* Ignore radiation from food and drink\n* Get more health, and passively regenerate\n* Resist addiction to all chems and alcohol\n\n**Charisma**\n\n* Barter the hell out of merchants, and invest in their enterprises\n* Beguile ANY woman (or man), ANY time\n* Get passive combat and carry weight buffs when alone (kinda weird)\n* Train an attack dog\n\n**Intelligence**\n\n* See... the closest... Okay, this one's dumb\n* Be a *Medic.* At *Two.* And people still think five is average?\n* Craft expert modifications for ANY gun\n* Hack computer terminals\n\n**Agility**\n\n* Be an expert gun slinger (at *one!?*)\n* Keep heavy, fully automatic rifles on target\n* Become a master of stealth (at three. Why am I still typing)\n* Sneak up on sleeping victims, and assassinate them. Also become a master of silent weaponry\n\nAaaand, just for shits and giggles, **Luck**\n\n* Casually find more caps than you know what to do with, and witness weird explosions of caps upon killing enemies\n* Nonchalantly find more ammo than you'll ever need, and *occasionally find spare clips in your pocket that you didn't put there*\n* Horrifically dismember your victims, regardless of your killing power or weapon type\n* Occasionally (or frequently) encounter the same stranger who saves your life *every time*\n\nSo, no, the average isn't even four. It's clearly just **one**. Like... I thought the new precedent for average was clearly implied. Regular people can't do all of this shit because regular people are strictly average. Maybe you graduate high school, join the army, and bump your intelligence enough during training to become a medic. Maybe, just maybe, at one point above average, you can start to charm women (or men) more so than your own gender. Does that sound like something a character would be able to do at 2 charisma, with the average being 5?\n\n... Christ. Why did I even reply.\n\nYour opinions are valid. I just want the new precedent to be well understood.\n\n**2nd Edit-- /u/Scotch-bonnet corrected me that 4 is the highest balanced SPECIAL spread**\n\n**3rd Edit-- So this is what gold feels like.

There have been the occasional lines in FO4 that have made me laugh, but it just doesn't feel...right? Like, so much of the dialogue is mostly very dry and somewhat pointless, just a \"yes\" or a \"Pfft, whatever\" sort of option. \n\nAnd I'm not knocking the voice actor's performances but...I don't know why it's been voice acted. My character looks like a murderboss death machine but sounds like he wants to burst into a James Blunt song at any moment, and then weep. It's just so off-kilter it's really startling.\n\nSo I'd guess I'd have to ask a question; what did Bethesda try and do with the dialogue? Because I've given it a very fair chance and it's really disappointing, at least to me. And I say this as a long-time fan of the series. Surely you'd want to...serve your fanbase first? The people who never once cared about a voiced protagonist? Like, I have never come across anyone who wanted one, nor have I ever thought it would be a good idea. \n\nSo did anyone doing the recording ask \"Is this a step forward or...sideways?\" Because while it opens an interesting new *potential* for immersion, that potential would have been far better served in truly letting the player create their character and not having us borrow one from Bethesda. My guy doesn't feel unique at all, nor does he feel very fun. \n\nWhy not skip the voice acting if immersion was the aim and put that effort somewhere where it's actually needed; for example, a hardcore mode, repair systems, or, at the very least, maintainence that would give certain benefits, or having a community building tutorial or having any snap-on features that weren't completely garbage or having more than like 5 chairs and 2 beds or...well, anything.\n\nIt just feels like they put so much effort into the voicing stuff and while it's...alright, I have to question it's placement in this sort of game. It's not bad, it's just \"why is this here?\" It removes a lot of roleplaying...and that's sort of the point.\n\nI really couldn't give a shit about Shaun. But my Nordic hulk with the voice of Oliver Twist really wants his kid back whenever somebody asks, it's just...damn.\n\nEDIT: Just a quick edit about a thought I had just.\n\nIt feels like what they tried to do was create a sort of \"The Witcher\" effect, and have you really immersed in this character as they progress along this narrative. I mean the dialogue camera even looks the same. But the problem with this is that Geralt of Rivia is already an established hardcase with a complicated backstory, literally written into a novel. He is not John or Jane Jerkoff, the guy hunts monsters and drinks poison for a living. He *has* a personality that can only be improved by the player actions. \n\nBut with Fallout 4, it feels like they went \"Let's make it feel Geralt-esque\" and just left us with a very, very generic character. Sorry, but spouse is dead, kid gone missing? Who wrote this story? Unoriginal Ideas Inc.? We can't alter Geralt's appearance, at least not wildly, so his voice suits him perfectly, regardless of what you choose to do. That's still immersive role-playing because the role you are playing is *Geralt*. But we're just playing someone we know nothing about, that we must create a story *for*. And Bethesda are just throwing up roadblocks at every opportunity to stop me from role-playing in a role-playing game. It's kind of insane. Why am I spending 3 months matching couches and rugs in various settlements and simultaneously being worried sick about my infant son? It's kind of ridiculous at best. \n\nMaybe I'd be more interested in pursuing my child if they put any effort whatsoever into creating an emotional story about him.

I thought i wasted hours and i mean HOURS of putting up fences, trying to line them up etc! WOOT WOOT! I love this game!", "id": "cyj3a7t"}, {"comment": "Fences COMBINED with elevated turrets are awesome.  Particularly, I discovered, missile turrets- those things fire volleys of like 3/sec.  If they're pointed outside the settlement, settlers will never venture outside the build area boundary into the field of fire, so the enemy and only the enemy will simply get blown apart in seconds.\n\nFences alone are kind of a waste, though.   Depending on how they were laid, some enemies  may be able to hop them, they don't block fire, you can't mount turrets on them, and they serve no additional function.\n\nThe concrete Shack Foundation or a row of Sheds will be an impenetrable wall you can mount turrets on, so the raiders are basically fucked utterly.  There's also the wood-pole Shed Foundation- you can technically walk through it, barely, but I doubt enemies could make a path through it.  Also you could  place Wells inside of the foundation to make it impenetrable AND get the Water benefit with  no additional ground space used.\n\nI basically did that, especially with small settlements.  The buildings with beds were also exterior wall-barriers with outward-facing missile turrets and power pylons on top.  Anyone spawning outside was toast.  \n\nIt's hard to see what really goes on during spawning, but raiders might be able to spawn inside, or teleport through a wall.  I made a settlement with a wood bridge spanning the front opening on the main road and a provisioner started walking-in-place against it for like 10 sec then teleported inside.  It was supposed to be traversable but the engine couldn't find the path so it just teleported.  I suspect if you wall the thing off 100%, new settlers, Provisioners, and Trashcan Carla vendors will still appear.\n\nIf you have a main gate, I suspect the game will draw a path that way and not teleport- but with the main gate heavily defended (outward-facing missile turrets), they'll never get within 100 ft of it.\n\nInward-facing machine gun and laser turrets are still necessary in case the enemy DOES make it in.  For this you still want them elevated, so they don't spray fire horizontally across the whole settlement when they fire on raiders.  Settlers may get in the line of fire and get shot by turrets.\n\nNo one was assigned to Defense.  It was a waste of resources.  The usable-wall strategy is particularly good for preserving the usable ground space for plants and wells.\n\nTesla traps were stupid.  The pressure pad fired on ANY trip, so it'll attack you and kill your settlers, and they only work once then require Repair.  BTW, you can place land mines instead!  Which oddly DON'T trip for friendlies (smart mine?  what, they're checking IDs?) and can be placed OUTSIDE the build area.  e.g. line the front road with mines.   They don't count as Defense points, but THEY DON'T COUNT TOWARDS THE BUILD LIMIT!\n\nThe raider spawnpoints seem to be fixed.  Sanctuary, if you look from above and consider 12 o'clock as the main road, was attacked from 2 o'clock and 5 o'clock.  \n\nRegrettably, once you build it up, it'll simply never get attacked again.\n\nEDIT: I take that back, landmines DO trigger on NPCs.

Game Designer at my night one. \n\nThe issues prevalent to mostly all Bethesda games are due to it's engine structure, overall development practice and incredibly small studio size. \n\nThey seem have a dev culture of \"Ship it When We think it's done!\" over there, which works for the majority of the time...kinda. Fallout 4 is the most stable BethSoft release, at least in my history, console or otherwise. Most I've run into is framerate hickups and Trashcan Carla's brahmin is stuck on top of my house in Sanctuary. This is on PC. \n\nStill there are problems others have reported. Missions becoming incomplete-able, game crashes, points in the game where the framerate tanks to oblivion (lol), unfinished assets being left out in the open, easy access to dev rooms/testing areas, even various gameplay things like what's the point of Wind Turbines? These are all things that are present across all releases of Fallout 4, AND all releases of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (PS3 not withstanding needing some extra help). These are also all things that a competent (or at least bigger) QA team could catch, if not the first time, then definitely the second time, especially when you're working with what is now a heavily modified (some call it sequel) to Gamebryo.\n\nIt's really the developers lack of attention, or lack of resources, or both, or neither because they're really just unlucky as fuck when it comes to catching fixable bugs in their games. I don't really know because I don't work at Bethesda (and if anyone does please please please enlighten me and also release the Creation Kit for Fallout 4) but it's a clear pattern with Bethesda that nothing they release works even semi 50% on launch. Been that way since Morrowind. Even before. \n\nConsoles haven't ruined anything, stop kicking that dead horse.

If you build a wall out of concrete foundation it often has to be built at multiple levels to make up for the uneven ground, which takes ages to align. Once you've built large objects or structures selecting them all together (i.e. by holding down the selection key) makes them weirdly difficult to relocate, sometimes disappearing into the ground.  There are so many issues with what will & will not snap together (4-story elevator doesn't snap to anything!), what will & will not clip through another piece, that you end up having to take shortcuts (make everything square & mostly symmetrical) and making things that are a lot uglier and more limited than you planned/hoped for.

"], [804, "For those of you at work behind a firewall:\n\n **Fallout 4 Add-Ons \u2013 Automatron, Wasteland Workshop, Far Harbor and More**\n\nSince Fallout 4 launched, we\u2019ve been blown away by your support for the game. It stands as our most successful title ever and that couldn\u2019t have happened without you. It\u2019s been truly inspiring, the stories, images and experiences that you\u2019ve created. And now it\u2019s time to share with you some of what we\u2019ve been creating \u2013 our first series of add-ons: Automatron, Wasteland Workshop and Far Harbor.\n\n[Automatron](http://imgur.com/a/7iWSe)\nPrice: $9.99 USD | \u00a37.99 GBP | $16.95 AUD\nRelease: March 2016\n\n>The mysterious Mechanist has unleashed a horde of evil robots into the Commonwealth, including the devious Robobrain. Hunt them down and harvest their parts to build and mod your own custom robot companions. Choose from hundreds of mods; mixing limbs, armor, abilities, and weapons like the all-new lightning chain gun. Even customize their paint schemes and choose their voices!\n\n[Wasteland Workshop](http://imgur.com/a/tNehW)\nPrice: $4.99 USD | \u00a33.99 GBP | $7.95 AUD\nRelease: April 2016\n\n>With the Wasteland Workshop, design and set cages to capture live creatures \u2013 from raiders to Deathclaws! Tame them or have them face off in battle, even against your fellow settlers. The Wasteland Workshop also includes a suite of new design options for your settlements like nixi tube lighting, letter kits, taxidermy and more!\n\n[Far Harbor](http://imgur.com/a/6dezO)\nPrice: $24.99 USD | \u00a319.99 GBP | $39.95 AUD\nRelease: May 2016\n\n>A new case from Valentine\u2019s Detective Agency leads you on a search for a young woman and a secret colony of synths. Travel off the coast of Maine to the mysterious island of Far Harbor, where higher levels of radiation have created a more feral world. Navigate through the growing conflict between the synths, the Children of Atom, and the local townspeople. Will you work towards bringing peace to Far Harbor, and at what cost? Far Harbor features the largest landmass for an add-on that we\u2019ve ever created, filled with new faction quests, settlements, lethal creatures and dungeons. Become more powerful with new, higher-level armor and weapons. The choices are all yours.\n\nAnd more important, that this is only the beginning. We have plans for more. More than $60 worth of new Fallout adventures and features throughout 2016.\n\nGiven the expanded DLC plan, the price of the season pass will increase from the current $29.99 to $49.99 USD (\u00a324.99 to \u00a339.99 GBP; $49.95 to $79.95 AUD) on March 1, 2016. However, if you already purchased the season pass for $29.99, nothing changes - you still get everything at no additional cost\u2014 the full $60 offering of add-on content for the original price of $29.99. In addition, if you didn\u2019t buy the season pass yet, there is still time: anyone who buys the Season Pass for $29.99 before March 1st will get all $60 worth of content. This is our way of saying thanks to all our loyal fans who have believed in us and supported us over the years.\n\nWant a chance to play these add-ons early? We\u2019ll be running closed betas for each of the add-ons for consoles and PC. And you can sign up right now on Bethesda.net. In order to apply, you\u2019ll need to create a registered Bethesda.net account. We\u2019ll be selecting applicants in the upcoming weeks. Players accepted into the beta will receive a code to redeem the content. The beta is the full version (complete with achievements) and those participating will not have to purchase the add-on.\n\nBeyond add-ons, we\u2019ll continue to offer free updates to the game, including new features like the recent weapon debris for PC, and increased draw distances for consoles, as well as more optimizations to gameplay and quests. And something that we\u2019re really excited about, a complete overhaul of Survival Mode that changes how you play the whole game: food, sleep, diseases, danger and more.\n\nWe\u2019re also hard at work on the Creation Kit, which will allow you to create and play mods absolutely free. We\u2019re currently testing both Survival Mode and the Creation Kit now, and more details will be forthcoming.\n\nThanks again for your continued support of Fallout 4.

It stands as our most successful title ever and that couldn\u2019t have happened without you. It\u2019s been truly inspiring, the stories, images and experiences that you\u2019ve created. And now it\u2019s time to share with you some of what we\u2019ve been creating \u2013 our first series of add-ons: Automatron, Wasteland Workshop and Far Harbor.\n\n[Automatron](http://imgur.com/a/7iWSe)\nPrice: $9.99 USD | \u00a37.99 GBP | $16.95 AUD\nRelease: March 2016\n\n>The mysterious Mechanist has unleashed a horde of evil robots into the Commonwealth, including the devious Robobrain. Hunt them down and harvest their parts to build and mod your own custom robot companions. Choose from hundreds of mods; mixing limbs, armor, abilities, and weapons like the all-new lightning chain gun. Even customize their paint schemes and choose their voices!\n\n[Wasteland Workshop](http://imgur.com/a/tNehW)\nPrice: $4.99 USD | \u00a33.99 GBP | $7.95 AUD\nRelease: April 2016\n\n>With the Wasteland Workshop, design and set cages to capture live creatures \u2013 from raiders to Deathclaws! Tame them or have them face off in battle, even against your fellow settlers. The Wasteland Workshop also includes a suite of new design options for your settlements like nixi tube lighting, letter kits, taxidermy and more!\n\n[Far Harbor](http://imgur.com/a/6dezO)\nPrice: $24.99 USD | \u00a319.99 GBP | $39.95 AUD\nRelease: May 2016\n\n>A new case from Valentine\u2019s Detective Agency leads you on a search for a young woman and a secret colony of synths. Travel off the coast of Maine to the mysterious island of Far Harbor, where higher levels of radiation have created a more feral world. Navigate through the growing conflict between the synths, the Children of Atom, and the local townspeople. Will you work towards bringing peace to Far Harbor, and at what cost? Far Harbor features the largest landmass for an add-on that we\u2019ve ever created, filled with new faction quests, settlements, lethal creatures and dungeons. Become more powerful with new, higher-level armor and weapons. The choices are all yours.\n\nAnd more important, that this is only the beginning. We have plans for more. More than $60 worth of new Fallout adventures and features throughout 2016.\n\nGiven the expanded DLC plan, the price of the season pass will increase from the current $29.99 to $49.99 USD (\u00a324.99 to \u00a339.99 GBP; $49.95 to $79.95 AUD) on March 1, 2016. However, if you already purchased the season pass for $29.99, nothing changes - you still get everything at no additional cost\u2014 the full $60 offering of add-on content for the original price of $29.99. In addition, if you didn\u2019t buy the season pass yet, there is still time: anyone who buys the Season Pass for $29.99 before March 1st will get all $60 worth of content. This is our way of saying thanks to all our loyal fans who have believed in us and supported us over the years.\n\nWant a chance to play these add-ons early? We\u2019ll be running closed betas for each of the add-ons for consoles and PC. And you can sign up right now on Bethesda.net. In order to apply, you\u2019ll need to create a registered Bethesda.net account. We\u2019ll be selecting applicants in the upcoming weeks. Players accepted into the beta will receive a code to redeem the content. The beta is the full version (complete with achievements) and those participating will not have to purchase the add-on.\n\nBeyond add-ons, we\u2019ll continue to offer free updates to the game, including new features like the recent weapon debris for PC, and increased draw distances for consoles, as well as more optimizations to gameplay and quests. And something that we\u2019re really excited about, a complete overhaul of Survival Mode that changes how you play the whole game: food, sleep, diseases, danger and more.\n\nWe\u2019re also hard at work on the Creation Kit, which will allow you to create and play mods absolutely free. We\u2019re currently testing both Survival Mode and the Creation Kit now, and more details will be forthcoming.\n\nThanks again for your continued support of Fallout 4.

It stands as our most successful title ever and that couldn\u2019t have happened without you. It\u2019s been truly inspiring, the stories, images and experiences that you\u2019ve created. And now it\u2019s time to share with you some of what we\u2019ve been creating \u2013 our first series of add-ons: Automatron, Wasteland Workshop and Far Harbor.\n\nAutomatron\nPrice: $9.99 USD | \u00a37.99 GBP | $16.95 AUD\nRelease: March 2016\n\nThe mysterious Mechanist has unleashed a horde of evil robots into the Commonwealth, including the devious Robobrain. Hunt them down and harvest their parts to build and mod your own custom robot companions. Choose from hundreds of mods; mixing limbs, armor, abilities, and weapons like the all-new lightning chain gun. Even customize their paint schemes and choose their voices!\n\nWasteland Workshop\nPrice: $4.99 USD | \u00a33.99 GBP | $7.95 AUD\nRelease: April 2016\n\nWith the Wasteland Workshop, design and set cages to capture live creatures \u2013 from raiders to Deathclaws! Tame them or have them face off in battle, even against your fellow settlers. The Wasteland Workshop also includes a suite of new design options for your settlements like nixi tube lighting, letter kits, taxidermy and more!\n\nFar Harbor\nPrice: $24.99 USD | \u00a319.99 GBP | $39.95 AUD\nRelease: May 2016\n\nA new case from Valentine\u2019s Detective Agency leads you on a search for a young woman and a secret colony of synths. Travel off the coast of Maine to the mysterious island of Far Harbor, where higher levels of radiation have created a more feral world. Navigate through the growing conflict between the synths, the Children of Atom, and the local townspeople. Will you work towards bringing peace to Far Harbor, and at what cost? Far Harbor features the largest landmass for an add-on that we\u2019ve ever created, filled with new faction quests, settlements, lethal creatures and dungeons. Become more powerful with new, higher-level armor and weapons. The choices are all yours.\n\nAnd more important, that this is only the beginning. We have plans for more. More than $60 worth of new Fallout adventures and features throughout 2016.\n\nGiven the expanded DLC plan, the price of the season pass will increase from the current $29.99 to $49.99 USD (\u00a324.99 to \u00a339.99 GBP; $49.95 to $79.95 AUD) on March 1, 2016. However, if you already purchased the season pass for $29.99, nothing changes - you still get everything at no additional cost\u2014 the full $60 offering of add-on content for the original price of $29.99. In addition, if you didn\u2019t buy the season pass yet, there is still time: anyone who buys the Season Pass for $29.99 before March 1st will get all $60 worth of content. This is our way of saying thanks to all our loyal fans who have believed in us and supported us over the years.\n\nWant a chance to play these add-ons early? We\u2019ll be running closed betas for each of the add-ons for consoles and PC. And you can sign up right now on Bethesda.net. In order to apply, you\u2019ll need to create a registered Bethesda.net account. We\u2019ll be selecting applicants in the upcoming weeks. Players accepted into the beta will receive a code to redeem the content. The beta is the full version (complete with achievements) and those participating will not have to purchase the add-on.\n\nBeyond add-ons, we\u2019ll continue to offer free updates to the game, including new features like the recent weapon debris for PC, and increased draw distances for consoles, as well as more optimizations to gameplay and quests. And something that we\u2019re really excited about, a complete overhaul of Survival Mode that changes how you play the whole game: food, sleep, diseases, danger and more.\n\nWe\u2019re also hard at work on the Creation Kit, which will allow you to create and play mods absolutely free. We\u2019re currently testing both Survival Mode and the Creation Kit now, and more details will be forthcoming.\n\nThanks again for your continued support of Fallout 4.

I too lost a brother, I was 15 yrs old, he was 16 yrs old, it was March 11, 1982, they didn't have video games back then, like they do now, there was no internet, no cell phones, no computers, well we didn't have one. \n\nIt was an accident, my brother was going to be a policeman in the town I live in, Vallejo, California, my parents bought him a .357 Magnum, he loaded it, so it was partially his fault, but his best friend got blamed for it, my parents didn't press charges or nothing, we knew it was an accident.  \n\nIts been 34 years now, and I still miss my brother like it was yesterday, the best advice I have for you is go ahead and cry when you feel like it, get out those negative emotions, because holding them inside isn't good for you; I wish I had that advice way back when Danny died; lets just say, my health is pretty much ruined these days, with (Oral Allergy Syndrome = allergic to all fresh fruits, all fresh vegetables, and all nuts), (IBS = makes it hard to each just about any fried foods, grilled foods, no dairy, no chocolate, no butter, no bacon, nothing with too much grease or fat), combine those = to very little I can eat, I held onto anger/sadness way too much over the loss of my brother, I had no other siblings, it was just me. \n\nMy father is 79, but he has been diagnosed with Dementia, its getting worse, and I have no idea how to deal with that. I never got married, I don't have any kids, I let the depression control my life, I urge you not to do the same. I have been diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder.  \n\nAnyway, I read your article about Fallout 4: Nuka World, that would have been nice if something/someone in the gaming world would have done that for me, but that is life.  Anyway, I just met your brother Evan's character in the game, and since I have a plethora of X-01 Power Armor Suits, I'm going to make one for your brother's Fallout 4: Nuka World Character, and leave it at his trailer, I hope you don't mind, but I believe in helping others, so that they don't ever get hurt like I did., this is the only way I know how to do it. \n\nI'm also a US Veteran, and if you ever need to just talk about stuff, give me a ring.

They can transport us to a world that just make the stresses of reality slow to a halt, if only for a moment.\n\n Sure, maybe it could be considered a crutch, but there are many tools that people use to get through stressful times, some are positive, some are not. Gaming is a positive hobby, and as can be seen here, it can break the digital barrier between the virtual world and the real world. \n\nWhat Bethesda did for you proves to me that devs, and even humans in general are capable of doing good things.

I too lost a brother, I was 15 yrs old, he was 16 yrs old, it was March 11, 1982, they didn't have video games back then, like they do now, there was no internet, no cell phones, no computers, well we didn't have one. \n\nIt was an accident, my brother was going to be a policeman in the town I live in, Vallejo, California, my parents bought him a .357 Magnum, he loaded it, so it was partially his fault, but his best friend got blamed for it, my parents didn't press charges or nothing, we knew it was an accident.  \n\nIts been 34 years now, and I still miss my brother like it was yesterday, the best advice I have for you is go ahead and cry when you feel like it, get out those negative emotions, because holding them inside isn't good for you; I wish I had that advice way back when Danny died; lets just say, my health is pretty much ruined these days, with (Oral Allergy Syndrome = allergic to all fresh fruits, all fresh vegetables, and all nuts), (IBS = makes it hard to each just about any fried foods, grilled foods, no dairy, no chocolate, no butter, no bacon, nothing with too much grease or fat), combine those = to very little I can eat, I held onto anger/sadness way too much over the loss of my brother, I had no other siblings, it was just me. \n\nMy father is 79, but he has been diagnosed with Dementia, its getting worse, and I have no idea how to deal with that.

Its like they created the environments, then started filling it, and genuinely ran out of ideas or time before filling it up.\n\nFor an RPG to have depth and story and choice, you need a hell of a lot more people to interact with. \n\nBethesda Game Studios simply lacks people. They are very good at the method they are using with the ~100 people they have. CD Projekt Red has 250+ last I recall. Bethesda just bit off more than they could chew.\n\nOutside of the \"shallow\" criticism, they seriously need to ditch the animation system they have. You can see each individual animation being pieced together with obvious intermediate poses between them. (Strafing for example, many of Dogmeat's animations). Maybe we are being spoiled by motion capture animations, but when watching facial animations I can picture the animator trying to mess with the parts of the face.

Not using classic RPG design is not the definition of the word \"shallow\". In some ways, Fallout 4 is deeper than Skyrim. The problem with your argument is that you're using classic RPG design as the ultimate in making a game \"deep\" and that you're ignoring the strengths the games actually do posses. I agree that the side quests are a weak point of Fallout 4, but side quests were a weak point in Morrowind too, which is possibly their most widely acclaimed game. Skyrim had some very interesting concepts for their side quests, but emotionally, they feel very flat. The whole game feels very emotionally flat to be honest. A story about a great hero who is destined to stop a dragon bent on world domination is more, well, shallow than a story about a parent who wakes up in a strange world and goes on a quest to find their child who really isn't the person the parent expected, or, in many cases, wanted to meet. A story about family, loyalty, and what it means to be human is a damn sight deeper than a story about stopping a dragon from taking over the world.\n\nThe lack of skill points is a non-issue. Do you honestly believe that putting numbers in your skills makes a game \"deeper\" than putting star icons in your skills? I could argue that perks are actually less shallow than skill points because they add a number of different abilities for you to play with. Skill points only make your static abilities better. Perks make the gameplay more varied and individualistic, and therefore more complex. As much as I enjoy games with skill points myself, I can't deny the appeal of perks, or argue that they make for a shallower game.\n\nEvery game is flawed. Bethesda's games have varied in quality like the games of every company. Fallout 4 is one of their better designed games over all. Skyrim is one of their weaker games, though I'd argue that it's not a bad game per se, but it really doesn't have the good pacing that Morrowind, Oblivion, and the Fallout games do, and some of its design choices are questionable. I'm not trying to excuse the shortcomings of Fallout 4 because Skyrim is shallow (I don't even think that Skyrim is shallow in general, just more shallow than Fallout 4) so much as I'm commenting that Bethesda's latest release always gets a backlash, and is compared negatively to their previous releases.

There's specifically washing your own dishes and pointedly leaving their dirty dishes unwashed. There's another extreme of taking that person's dirty dishes and leaving them in front of their bedroom door, or worse, on their bed.

Even if it was a passive aggressive note. I'm pretty non-confrontational but I'm also stupidly willful/stubborn. If roommates  confronted me face to face (especially if they were rude about it), I'd feel super awkward and uncomfortable and it built up WAY more resentment for me than a note ever did.

Any time the fate of Nirn is uncertain, Akatosh breaks time into a myriad of parallel universes where fate is permitted to play out in an infinite number of ways. Then, Akatosh selects the timeline that coincides with \"destiny\", or rather, Akatosh's favored outcome, chooses that to be the true timeline, and then corrects the Dragon Break, resulting in a single outcome.\n\nNone of your choices matter to the lore because the next installment selects a single outcome and elects to form the story around that.\n\nSo your choice doesn't matter, not just in-game, but after the game. If the choice sucks in-game, that's all she wrote because what happens after is up to the developers and not down to you.\n\nSkyrim's story was terrible.

Of course not.  And you can extrapolate that for every genre of games that exist.  CRPGs are ripe for building because that is part of what a RPG is.  You take the world and make it your own.\n\nBefore we had the computing power to allow users to shape their environment we, the collective we, were limited in what we could do with a CRPG.  Can a CRPG provide a full story and the ability for you to build your own castle?  No, we don't have that luxury because we need every scrap of disc space, CPU power, etc to provide the story, RPG engine, and graphics that make the game.\n\nBut now we are seeing the next step in an CRPG where we can allow more than just character development which has been the hallmark of CRPGs.  That character can shape the world just like you can in a Pen & Paper RPG.  They can build a castle!  They can use that castle then to interact with the world in more than just a static story point of way that was present before in something like Morrowind.\n\nI remember sitting with my AD&D books, the 1970's stuff for those who are worried about my nerd creds, and designing dungeons with the help of those books.

Anyone who disagrees will be downvoted to oblivion because opinions are not a thing at all and we should all downvote them because we don't want to be labelled as sexists.\n\nSeriously, the downvotes are fucked up. I get the completely rude replies but if a hot guy were to post a tattoo on his chest and girls were all like \"look at his chest, so hot\" then it would be on the top. I can get that too because the gaming society is so afraid of being labelled as sexists(not OK with it but at least the reason is known) but why downvote pure opinions who say that \"OK it's not my thing but it's good.\" You posted it on a public site, *obviously* people will comment with their opinions.\n\nAnd the curious questions, like what will you do with it when you're 50? They're not wrong you know...it's just a honest question, not a jab at you or tattoos or females. I just saw one with 15 downvotes though. Seriously, why?? O.o\n\nI'm not interested in starting a discussion about how girls and boys differ in games because I'm not an expert and I'll easily lose against a large community who is fixated on upvoting this post because it's a girl (no, not talking about everyone. Just about those 15 other people who downvoted normal opinions). I just posted this because the downvotes piss me off.\n\n(I fully expect this to get downvoted too and probably some intelligent gamer will tell me that \"I wish someone would slap you\". Seriously, someone posted that and it got 40+ upvotes. The downvoted comment only said that he checked for Gonewild pics and there weren't any. He wasn't rude or all like \"Ooh check her melons\". Just a typical comment which is to be expected on any hot person(girl or guy) and like I said, it's a public site. People will differ in their POVs and they will post it. There's no reason to say \"I wish someone would slap you\" at all. I want to slap that guy tbh... But that'll just ruin my whole point.)\n\n/rant\n\n[Edit : Minus 6 downvotes at the moment. Well, at least it got controversial which means at least a few people agree with me. I've yet to see anyone give an actual argument for the downvotes except for one liner jokes. Oh and it's no secret from reading my post(or my post history) that I care about downvotes. It's just who I am so no, I'm not mad neither do I need your hugs.]\n\nAnd as for OP, I do like the concept. I'm not a fan of tattoos tbh but I can see the appeal. I do wish the tattoo was a lot smaller in scale and just Codsworth without all the translucent background and the flower(I don't see how that fits). Again, this is just my opinion.\n\nAnd if you like it, then it's all good and like I said I'm not a fan so I wouldn't know much about tattoos either. BTW this is the Fallout *4*... I wonder if you went so big and covered half your arm for this then what you would have done for other games which you loved more(fallout or otherwise).\n\nSorry for offending anyone.

I have enjoyed the game very much. But haven't finished it yet. In fact, I'm playing another one already and might eventually go back to Fallout 4, but maybe not.\n\nSo...did this game just connect with you on a deeply personal level?", "id": "d249xjj"}, {"comment": "I'm honestly surprised it's taken this long in the day for me to have to write *that long tattoo explanation*. Deep breath. Bring on the trolls. Here goes.\n\nGrowing up, I was made fun of for being a nerdy kid. Fast-forward to adulthood. I met a group of amazing people who embraced their geeky side, and taught me to embrace mine. I learned to be comfortable with myself. Fallout was the game that really transitioned me into a gamer, and had so many amazing things baked into it. Retrofuturism. Strategy. A dystopian future where humor still exists. Whatever. What's more, in 2016 it's almost trendy to be a gamer. And a nerd. Or whatever. So that comfort I have in wearing who I am for everyone to see? Now manifests with me literally being able to wear it on my sleeve.\n\nWhere it takes a departure from being Fallout alone is where Codsworth, a loyal companion, is. He's in the middle of a shit rad storm, looking ahead to where there's a beautiful sunset in East Boston. FWIW, I'm a Boston transplant, from Philly via New Jersey, and moved to this city because I felt like, in my gut, I was being called here. Fell in love with the city. Whatever. Bought my first place in East Boston last year. So in a sense, Codsy is looking ahead, knowing he's in the thick of the shit right now but it can get better. For me, he's looking towards home. It's a reminder that even when things seem like they're at their worst, they can get better. Any storm can be weathered, and literally anything is possible. That's where the airship comes in. Nobody expects that in the game. Same thing in life - shit happens that you don't account for. But unknowns bring possibility, and as long as you keep living, the possibilities are endless. Stay curious, stay adventurous.\n\n**TL;DR** Fallout did impact me deeply, and this tattoo is a badge of pride for who I am & what I've been through, and a reminder to look on the bright side because save for a Trump presidency, life isn't ever going to be as rough as it is in the game.

Anyone who disagrees will be downvoted to oblivion because opinions are not a thing at all and we should all downvote them because we don't want to be labelled as sexists.\n\nSeriously, the downvotes are fucked up. I get the completely rude replies but if a hot guy were to post a tattoo on his chest and girls were all like \"look at his chest, so hot\" then it would be on the top. I can get that too because the gaming society is so afraid of being labelled as sexists(not OK with it but at least the reason is known) but why downvote pure opinions who say that \"OK it's not my thing but it's good.\" You posted it on a public site, *obviously* people will comment with their opinions.\n\nAnd the curious questions, like what will you do with it when you're 50? They're not wrong you know...it's just a honest question, not a jab at you or tattoos or females. I just saw one with 15 downvotes though. Seriously, why?? O.o\n\nI'm not interested in starting a discussion about how girls and boys differ in games because I'm not an expert and I'll easily lose against a large community who is fixated on upvoting this post because it's a girl (no, not talking about everyone. Just about those 15 other people who downvoted normal opinions). I just posted this because the downvotes piss me off.\n\n(I fully expect this to get downvoted too and probably some intelligent gamer will tell me that \"I wish someone would slap you\". Seriously, someone posted that and it got 40+ upvotes. The downvoted comment only said that he checked for Gonewild pics and there weren't any. He wasn't rude or all like \"Ooh check her melons\". Just a typical comment which is to be expected on any hot person(girl or guy) and like I said, it's a public site. People will differ in their POVs and they will post it. There's no reason to say \"I wish someone would slap you\" at all. I want to slap that guy tbh... But that'll just ruin my whole point.)\n\n/rant\n\n[Edit : Minus 6 downvotes at the moment. Well, at least it got controversial which means at least a few people agree with me. I've yet to see anyone give an actual argument for the downvotes except for one liner jokes. Oh and it's no secret from reading my post(or my post history) that I care about downvotes. It's just who I am so no, I'm not mad neither do I need your hugs.]\n\nAnd as for OP, I do like the concept. I'm not a fan of tattoos tbh but I can see the appeal. I do wish the tattoo was a lot smaller in scale and just Codsworth without all the translucent background and the flower(I don't see how that fits). Again, this is just my opinion.\n\nAnd if you like it, then it's all good and like I said I'm not a fan so I wouldn't know much about tattoos either. BTW this is the Fallout *4*... I wonder if you went so big and covered half your arm for this then what you would have done for other games which you loved more(fallout or otherwise).\n\nSorry for offending anyone.

The environment is extremely harsh, the weapons themselves are often hundreds of years old, and who even knows what condition all the ammo is in? We scavenge most of it from old buildings and dead enemies, after all. It's either ancient factory-made ammo or it's hand-loaded by unknown individuals who may or may not have had a clue what they were doing.\n\nEven in real-life, I've heard of plenty of people who can't get their (new) guns to run reliably on certain brands of (new, factory-made) ammo, so it's not exactly a stretch that you'd get a lot of duds in the wasteland when ammo of unknown age and origin that you scavenged from the dead is all you've got to work with.", "id": "d0kndl3"}, {"comment": "Hmm, you're right.

Shooting a gun causes high pressure stuff to come out of the barrel, not into it.\n\nAir rushing into the barrel is not what causes recoil in a ballistic weapon. When the gunpowder burns it changes phase into a gas. That gas is much less dense than the powder and expands inside the chamber and barrel of the gun. That expansion creates pressure that pushes the bullet out of the barrel. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. So as much force as is imparted to the bullet is also exerted backwards into the gun. That is what recoil is, and why lighter guns and more energetic rounds produce more of it.", "id": "d0kzztm"}, {"comment": "Huh, well that's what I was taught, it made sense because most of the recoil was after the shot when recorded with high-speed.

That would require negative pressure in the gun, but the pressure during a shot spikes up potentially as high as several thousand psi and then rapidly drops back down to ambient pressure. The reason you see most of the recoil after the bullet has left the barrel is because of inertia. The gun has more mass than the bullet, thus more inertia, thus it will take longer to be accelerate back than the bullet takes to be accelerated forwards. That's also why heavier guns have less felt recoil, all other things being equal.  ", "id": "d0lptx4"}], [{"comment": "You know what you have to do now, right?

The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. There were simultaneous Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been strong, disappeared. Clandestine support of Britain (e.g., the Neutrality Patrol) was replaced by active alliance.

The attack led to the United States' entry into World War II. The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. There were simultaneous Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held Philippines and on the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters. The following day, December 8, the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism, which had been strong, disappeared. Clandestine support of Britain (e.g., the Neutrality Patrol) was replaced by active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day", "id": "d836zyz"}, {"comment": "Goddamn it, Tiny Rick....", "id": "d83pf6x"}, {"comment": "FUCK YA IM TINY RICK", "id": "d84llgn"}]]], "5g2u9v": ["Thanks to PS4 mods I was also able to pay tribute...", "2016-12-02 14:43:07", 4553, "http://imgur.com/NynEGsg", [[468, "\"Nora... *sniff*, you, you made me a... moderately happy man.

I bet if the vendors at those settlements refreshed well, the caps I get for free would go way up at those settlements. I have several glitchy settlements.\n\nMutfruit would be better than water (it's lighter) but I couldn't resist building water factories for the wasteland.", "id": "cywowby"}, {"comment": "Quite a few. The best thing to do is to invest in the local leader perk and set up shops in the settlement you use the most, so you can just sell to them.

Considering I can't even carry that many it's been a non-issue so far. The first thing I would do is make sure they haven't been attacked. If you've failed to defend your settlement they will likely need repairs. If you've established a supply line to a settlement that does not have a large water surplus that can sap your production as well. After that I would check your power lines, there might be a missing connection somewhere that's left them disabled. If you've recently built powered items I'd also make sure you have sufficient generators. The power/water numbers at the top are not perfect at catching these issues and going to red.", "id": "cywomjw"}, {"comment": "Thanks so much. What do you mean by repairs?

Using NVEdit scripts and things to automatically convert worldspaces and cells, we're confident we can recreate the places in NV and Fallout 3.\n\nHard part is populating them. Although there may be ways around it using flash games, gambling from NV does not exist in Fallout 4. Additionally, things like multiple ammo types are gone. Fallout 4 lacks several features New Vegas had. Skill checks are also a consideration.\n\nIt'll also be impossible to have all of NV and Fallout 3's dialog. Fallout 4 carries out dialog in things called scenes. The scenes always call for exactly four responses, then move on to the next part of the dialog. This is why the dialog doesn't change anything in base Fallout 4 - it's a line, not a tree. Sometimes you can halt progress by asking a question, but that's more of a sidestep followed by getting back in line.\n\nThe hardest part is that in the tests I've conducted so far, the only piece of data Fallout 4 and Fallout NV NPCs share in common is the name field - things like AI packages and factions, while largely unchanged, don't show up as part of the imported NPC form when ported with them. That means every single NPC will need to be remade from scratch and placed without some sort of conversion utility.\n\nGetting Fallout 3's content into NV, while a lot of hard work, was akin to the scene in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly where Tuco makes a new gun out of the guns that had interchangeable parts. Getting NV and Fallout 3 into Fallout 4 is more like getting your propeller plane engine to a streamlined fighter jet that doesn't have the comfortable seats or scenic view of the prop plane. Fallout 4 is fast and streamlined, but the old version could just flat out do more.\n\nI don't speak for the rest of the team, and we haven't committed to anything yet. But I have a feeling if we try to do a straight up conversion, we're going to find we successfully rebuilt the previous games' minds and bodies, but we'll be missing their souls. I think this would be a good opportunity to tell new stories in old places.\n\nThat being said, I'm sure Bethesda probably has a lot of these conversion tools I'm talking about - if development of Fallout 4 began in 2008, you can bet they started off with a very similar setup to Fallout 3 or early Skyrim. If they ended up doing something crazy in 2017 like releasing remastered versions of Fallout 3 and NV on the new engine, then we've just scaled this back to a TTW scale problem instead of a Skyblivion scale problem.", "id": "d3q39kz"}, {"comment": "That was comprehensive.

Much more than the original TTW, which was no mean feat.   \n\nI wonder if there is some way to script those npc conversions.  There data must be there somewhere in the new version.

Also, showing an interest in each others' hobbies, even if we don't partake in them, creates a very loving feeling.
