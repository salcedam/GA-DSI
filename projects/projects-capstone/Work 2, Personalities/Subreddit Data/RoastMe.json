It's your boobs that make you look overweight, which is funny because they're not even real. They're not implants either. \n\nYou're wearing several bras and you did a terrible job at creating the illusion of having big boobs and only the top cleavage part is really your boobs. And your real, smaller boobs are squishing together and pushing up for dear life. You can see you literally pulled your shirt down with your finger, which is obvious you wanted to show your cleavage. Cool. But you see where you messed up by doing that? It's hollow and the shirt dips in between your top bra and your rounded cleavage. Big boobs don't dip in there. That's a hollow space between a stuffed bra and a boob. \n\nBut next time you do this trick, pay attention to the rest of the boobs, between the cleavage and the bottom. See how flat it looks? It can't possibly be that flat with that round of cleavage on top. No matter how many of those bras you put on, it wouldn't flatten everything but the top, I have boobs, I know. PLUS I can see 2, actually I think I see 3 bra lines on the boob to the right of the pic. \n\nRound out and form the whole boob next time with your hands, make the sides and front rounded, and they might look real. Stack the layers of bras more on top of eachother instead of underneath eachother. Put one underwire directly under the other. Wear a tight undershirt so you can't see the multiple bra lines and don't wear a light thin shirt that shows all of your bras. I know what you did, because I've done it when I was younger. Lol. So don't come back with \"oh it's a sports bra with lines\" or \"I'm wearing 2 undershirts\". I know what's up. Boobs aren't flat everywhere except the top.

It's your boobs that make you look overweight, which is funny because they're not even real. They're not implants either. \n\nYou're wearing several bras and you did a terrible job at creating the illusion of having big boobs and only the top cleavage part is really your boobs. And your real, smaller boobs are squishing together and pushing up for dear life. You can see you literally pulled your shirt down with your finger, which is obvious you wanted to show your cleavage. Cool. But you see where you messed up by doing that? It's hollow and the shirt dips in between your top bra and your rounded cleavage. Big boobs don't dip in there. That's a hollow space between a stuffed bra and a boob. \n\nBut next time you do this trick, pay attention to the rest of the boobs, between the cleavage and the bottom. See how flat it looks? It can't possibly be that flat with that round of cleavage on top. No matter how many of those bras you put on, it wouldn't flatten everything but the top, I have boobs, I know. PLUS I can see 2, actually I think I see 3 bra lines on the boob to the right of the pic. \n\nRound out and form the whole boob next time with your hands, make the sides and front rounded, and they might look real. Stack the layers of bras more on top of eachother instead of underneath eachother. Put one underwire directly under the other. Wear a tight undershirt so you can't see the multiple bra lines and don't wear a light thin shirt that shows all of your bras. I know what you did, because I've done it when I was younger. Lol. So don't come back with \"oh it's a sports bra with lines\" or \"I'm wearing 2 undershirts\". I know what's up. Boobs aren't flat everywhere except the top.

The surgeon basically hacked away flesh with a scalpel and left a hole in my back. I believe my nurse said my hole was just about the size of a baseball. I *believe* the procedure makes it so flesh heals within the cyst cavity and closes it.\n\n\nThey pack the hole with gauze pads. \n\n\nEvery single day for about 60 days I went to the outpatient department and had the used gauze replaced by fresh gauze.\n\n\nBasically the hole heals around the gauze. The reason for the gauze is so the hole doesn't heal only on the surface leaving a hollow space under the skin. \n\n\nSo, each day, the hole heals a little and the gauze gets replaced. As the days go by, the hole gets smaller and less gauze goes in. I think about half way through the recovery, they stopped using gauze pads, and started using packing.\n\n\nPacking is like gauze, but it's a like a super long shoelace. I have something like 20 feet of it stuffed in me if I recall correctly. Every day it gets replaced by a shorter amount.\n\nAnd let me tell you this, all 60 appointments were fucking painful. What happens is your skin starts to heal into the the packing and your nerves are growing back. So, when they pull that string like I'm a pullstring toy, it rips away from the nerves and flesh that is stuck to it. \n\n\nBut it was nothing compared to the problems I had before the surgery. I dealt with this thing for many years. It was constantly getting infected and swelling to the point I couldn't really move and was in perpetual agony until it was popped and drained. \n\n\nThe time the brought on the surgery was really awful.

I was admitted to the hospital and had to wait like 3 days until my surgery.

But she worries.\n\nThe microwave beeps, the tendies are done. She places the paper plate next to you on the computer desk in a dark room filled with empty bags of doritos and bottles of mountain dew. You barely acknowledge her as you're in the middle of a raid and need to devote your full attention to buffing the group with protection spells. Timing is critical.\n\nWistfully, your mother leaves the room and heads to the bedroom. Once she closes the door, she sits on the bed and sobs uncontrollably. How did this happen? She was supposed to be retired by now. She was supposed to have grandchildren to dote on. Instead, she has her stinky, sweaty man child who does nothing but eat her out of house and home and play video games all day. She can't bear to cut you loose. She can't bear to leave this world knowing that you won't be taken care of. She wishes she could go back in time, tell her younger self to cook more at home and stop relying so much on McDonalds for family dinners. She wishes she could tell her younger self that the career she sacrificed everything for was a waste and that she'd just lose that job anyway in the economic downturn. But she can't take it back now. There are no do-overs in life. She contemplates this as her despair and sadness reduce her to tears. Just as she finally drifts off to sleep, your voice pierces the night.\n\n\"Mom! I'm out of tendies!\"\n\nShe contemplates telling you that 2 family-sized bags of chicken tenders is enough for one day, and that she isn't your slave. But your relationship is far, far past that. Her will and sense of self-esteem were eroded years ago. Deep down, she know she should be your mom and not your robot servant, but muscle memory is already kicking in.

And she sighs, and goes to the freezer to pull out more tendies to microwave for you. She sniffles as she starts the microwave, wondering if she's going to outlive you, or worse yet, how she's going to continue caring for you when she grows too old to work. She worries what will happen to you when she's not around to take care of you anymore. Will you turn homeless? Become a ward of the state? She doesn't know. But she worries.\n\nThe microwave beeps, the tendies are done. She places the paper plate next to you on the computer desk in a dark room filled with empty bags of doritos and bottles of mountain dew. You barely acknowledge her as you're in the middle of a raid and need to devote your full attention to buffing the group with protection spells. Timing is critical.\n\nWistfully, your mother leaves the room and heads to the bedroom. Once she closes the door, she sits on the bed and sobs uncontrollably. How did this happen? She was supposed to be retired by now. She was supposed to have grandchildren to dote on. Instead, she has her stinky, sweaty man child who does nothing but eat her out of house and home and play video games all day. She can't bear to cut you loose. She can't bear to leave this world knowing that you won't be taken care of. She wishes she could go back in time, tell her younger self to cook more at home and stop relying so much on McDonalds for family dinners. She wishes she could tell her younger self that the career she sacrificed everything for was a waste and that she'd just lose that job anyway in the economic downturn. But she can't take it back now. There are no do-overs in life. She contemplates this as her despair and sadness reduce her to tears. Just as she finally drifts off to sleep, your voice pierces the night.\n\n\"Mom! I'm out of tendies!\"\n\nShe contemplates telling you that 2 family-sized bags of chicken tenders is enough for one day, and that she isn't your slave. But your relationship is far, far past that.
