Don't do this!\n\n- Stay away from chips! They're addictive, fatty, and they go through your stomach in a pinch, and you're hungry yet again!\n\n- One thing that's not on this list is mayonnaise. ONE tablespoon, just one is almost 100 cals! 1 cup of mayo is 1500cals, while 1 cup of mustard is 165cals! One cup of ketchup is 268cals. Choose your condiments carefully! Put some vegetables on your sandwich, don't be a pussy! Instead of ONE TABLESPOON of mayo (100cals), have an apple! It's the same number of calories, but you're fuller!\n\n- Choose what you'll eat and what makes you more full. One BigMac is 530cals, one large serving of McD french fries is 500cals.

This is click-bait, nothing more, nothing less. ", "id": "czspwfg"}, {"comment": "He does speak in absolutes which is awfully silly, but there is merit to what he's saying. He seems to completely glance over the concept of meta-cognition, in which people can think about the way that they think.\n\nThere are a lot of people voting for Marco Rubio simply based on his statements about certain social issues. [Take this video on his views on abortion and gay marriage for example.](https://youtu.be/OSKw6oDzIv4?t=35s)\n\nNote how he calls it traditional marriage, and note how he specifically makes the statement that \"belief in traditional marriage does not make you a bigot or a hater.\" Marco Rubio polls as one of the most religious candidates in the election, and having gone to church most of my life, I can see how religious individuals would identify with his statements on marriage. \"Traditional\" and \"Cornerstone\" are thrown around all of the time in churches because Evangelical Christians are brought up to value \"the way things were.\" Rubio comes off as very genuine, especially at the end of that video (Edit: This video doesn't have it, but you can find an extended version where he says it.) when he says \"I would rather lose an election than be wrong about abortion.\" Almost like a \"martyr\" of sorts.\n\nGenerally, when you agree with someone's opinion, you already held that opinion before. Very rarely do you find that people change their deep rooted opinions. Look at Reddit's fervent support of Bernie Sanders. Reddit loved Socialism before Sanders was even a though in anyone's mind. Reddit looked on countries like Sweden and Finland with envy at how progressive and happy they were (and are.) A big example is college. Reddit, before Sanders was a thought in anyone's mind on a large scale, believed college to be too expensive and because of the average age of people on Reddit, were experiencing the woes associated with rising costs of education. Sanders comes on the scene and claims that he will take a small percentage of tax money from the super rich and use it to greatly reduce the cost of college, or even make it free. Reddit, and other college age individuals immediately identified with that idea and jumped on the opportunity to support him. Or that he was a proponent for the legalization of marijuana, and jumped on the opportunity to support him. When I'm sure that most people, (without googling) have absolutely no idea where he stands on the issue of using nuclear energy or know ass about his stance on foreign policy. But just like Rubio, Sanders comes off as very genuine (which is why people note his consistency as one of his strong suits) and they identify with him.\n\nThe same is true of most supporters of most political candidates. Humans are indeed emotional creatures. However, there is a way to overcome it. That's through meta-cognition. If you step back and think about *why* you really agree with a political candidate,  seek to gain information, and become an informed voter (or even just an informed individual about things you talk about) *that's* when you can truly identify who's right and who's wrong. Even then, you'll be influenced by your past experiences.\n\nBtw, this video is just scratching the surface and putting things in layman's terms. Heuristics are incredibly complicated and a 5 second explanation will *not* do them justice.

I will say the last few points made by Thomas Waugh are on point and ideally how every bartender should be preparing their cocktails.\n\n> 1.   Chill your mixing (stirring) glass \u2014 ice works, as does a fridge or freezer.\n\n> 2.   If making multiple drinks, build the shaken drinks first, but without ice, and set aside.\n\n> 3.   Continue to build the stirred drinks  in the cold mixing glass.\n\n> 4.   Stir without breaks until the stirred drink is cold (we found that 45 seconds is an ideal stirring period).\n\n> 5. Crack some ice to maximize surface area. Note: too much cracked ice will hinder the control of your dilution rate.\n\n> 6. Pour stirred drinks first.\n\n> 5.   Finish the order by adding ice to your shaken drinks and shaking, as shaking is a much more efficient technique.\n\nI will say, if you're vigorously shaking your martini's, you will have more water dilution, because your martini glass itself only has a *finite amount of space*. If a martini glass holds 4oz and your Manhattan is 2.5oz Rye and .75oz sweet vermouth, then thats ideally 3.25oz of liquid in a 4oz martini glass. Cool.

Just make sure you rest the steak first before cutting. \n\nPersonally, the way I cook my steak is these steps:\n\n1) take the steak out of the packaging, liberally salt and pepper it, then let it rest inside my fridge uncovered on a cookie cooling rack for anywhere anywhere between 2-4 days. This allows the salt to really get into the steak for a more evenly flavored steak. Additionally, the salt actually help keep the steak more juicy. The steak dries a little bit, but only on the very outside. It kind of creates a barrier to protect the inside of the steak, creates a better crust, and concentrates the flavors. \n\n2) the day of cooking, I take the steak out of the fridge a couple hours before cooking and flavor it usually with some fresh garlic. You can flavor it with what ever you like. I have done it with a chipotle paste, a curry paste, brown sugar and coffee, etc. I don't put the herbs/flavors on until a couple hours before because leaving those things on the steak tend to oxidize the oils and flavors and create off flavors. \n\n3) I like to use a cast iron skillet to cook my steak. I heat the pan up with a little bit canola oil (or any oil with a high smoking point). Then a lot of it depends on the steak. If it is a thinner steak, I tend don't even bother with the oven. I actually like steaks that are not incredible thick because bothering with the oven is just an extra step I'd rather skip. For thicker steaks, I usually avoid the oven by covering up my pan to trap the heat for more even cooking. However, you have to be careful if you do that because the steak cooks much faster. Make sure you don't use too much oil since if it is a good steak, tons of fat will be rendered out of the steak. I usually judge the steak by touch and feel for the temp. When it is about 60-70% done, I usually put in some unsalted butter and with 1-2 crushed cloves of garlic. I usually don't have rosemary on hand but that is pretty tasty to add also. I baste the steak constantly at this point with the oils that are in the pan. \n\n4) I remove the steak from the pan to let it rest. Depending on what I have done previously, I might make a pan sauce with some minced shallots, wine, and butter. If I am trying to impress someone, I would slice up the steak after resting for a nicer presentation and so they don't have to cut around the gristle and fat. ", "id": "cyzj6wv"}, {"comment": "That's a great recipe man. All I'm saying is if you're teaching a man to cook a steak, braising it in butter is a shortcut to a good tasting steak. It's just not the best way to teach someone to cook a steak if that's going to be the way you're going to make it at home because it adds a fuck ton of calories. It's a great once in awhile steak but every man should know how to make a steak that won't fuck up his diet.", "id": "cyzkyjh"}, {"comment": "I completely agree, but the impression I got from that post was how to make something well. Most of their recipes are a lot more complicated and fancier than what I would do when I cook for myself. \n\nI cook steak of myself once a blue moon and it is mostly just salt, pepper and garlic in a cast iron. I don't even keep butter at home most of the time. \n\nCheck out this recipe if you want a cheaper, healthier, and amazing tasting steak. \n\n1) take a zip lock bag, add a skirt/flank steak (way cheaper and lower in fat). Squeeze 1 lime, 1 lemon, and 1 orange in there. Add some chipotle paste or blend some chipotle peppers in in blender and add it. Add salt, pepper, olive oil, and cumin (and raw minced garlic if you like). \n\n2) let it sit for no longer than 12 hours (4-6 usually does the trick for me). The acid breaks down the the tougher cut and tenderizes it. \n\n3) Throw it on the grill until your preferred temp (since it is a tougher cut, I recommend no more than medium). \n\n4) rest and and slice against the grain of the meat.  Serve it with some sliced avocados or make a avocado pico. \n\nIt is great with a tortilla or just by itself. A flank/skirt steak is big enough for several meals and it is way healthier than a ribeye or a filet (and probably for the same price). \n\nI know this is not a the same style of steak as the recipes we mentioned before. However, for everyday eating at home, it is simple, cheaper, and healthier. ", "id": "cyzlhwr"}, {"comment": "Yea I see where you're coming from. Thanks for sharing that recipe.

In those training courses we have to put out fires in pans of diesel fuel with ABC dry powder extinguishers. They work quite well and if you can put out a diesel fire with one, then you can put out any grease fire you're likely to encounter in a home kitchen. By \"pan of diesel\" I mean a square box about 2'x2' and about 8\" deep. \n\nAs others have said, for large commercial kitchens with large deep fryers you would need a class K extinguisher because you're dealing with a lot more oil. Oil likes to spontaneously ignite once it's above a certain temperature so you can put the fire out (maybe) with a dry powder extinguisher but it will quickly reignite and you're fucked. Hopefully at home you catch it before it gets roaring hot and extinguish it. The small amount of grease should cool quickly and you can knock down any flare ups in the meantime. That's why fire extinguishers are not a \"one and done,\" type deal. You knock down the initial fire with as little powder as possible and then just watch for flare ups and knock them down as they occur. I don't like those dinky little extinguishers sold for kitchen use for this reason. I have 20lb ABC just around the corner so that I have plenty of powder to deal with flare ups. \n\nSomething else you may have heard about grease fires is you can't put them out with water. Well, there's an exception to that as well. In training they teach us how to do it using larger pans of diesel and I'm talking 10'x10' steel pans. Basically all you have to do is set your nozzle on your fire hose to the water wall setting and use the wall to push the flames from one side of the pan to the other, using the wind if there is any to help you, and then corral the fire into one corner and finally extinguish it. The fire can't come back through the wall so you're pushing it ahead of the wall and denying it fuel as you push it out of the pan. It's quite fun actually. \n\nAnother fun scenario they do at the training centre, just because I like talking about this shit, is the \"pressure fire.\" So named because it's a pipe with diesel flowing through it under \"pressure\" and there's a nozzle on the side of the pipe spraying diesel which they ignite and ask the students to advance into the inferno to close a valve, which places the student under a lot of \"pressure.\" See, clever bit of word play there. Anyway, basically you need a team of five for this and two fire hoses. Two people on each fire hose stand side by side to each other so they can advance with their nozzles exactly side by side, neither one advancing ahead of the other. The fifth person gets between the two hose teams and they all huddle up so they're as compact a group as possible. Then the two hose teams set their nozzles to the water wall setting so that you literally have a wall of water in front of the group (firefighting nozzles are standardized so that you turn the ring to to left for water wall and right for the powerful stream, \"left for life, right for reach\"). Then under the call of the man in the middle you advance. In training at my local centre we shout \"step,\" and everyone takes one step, repeat until you get where you want to be. The fire can't come back through the water wall so it's roaring right in your face but can't actually touch you and it's quite unnerving at first but very, very cool. So, you advance as a team, pushing the flames ahead of you until you get right up to the pipe and the fifth guy can reach the valve to shut off the flow of diesel and kill the fire. Then you use the hoses to knock down any incidental little puddles that may be on fire around you and head back to the training building for coffee and sandwiches.

Extinguishers that are suitable for Class A fires should be identified by a triangle containing the letter \"A.\"\n\n>A **Class B** fire extinguisher is used for flammable liquid and gas fires such as oil, gasoline, etc. These fire extinguishers deprive the fire of oxygen and interrupt the fire chain by inhibiting the release of combustible vapors. Extinguishers that are suitable for Class B fires should be identified by a square containing the letter \"B.\"\n\n>A **Class C** fire extinguisher is used on fires that involve live electrical equipment, which require the use of electrically nonconductive extinguishing agents. (Once the electrical equipment is de-energized, extinguishers for Class A or B fires may be used.) Extinguishers that are suitable for Class C fires should be identified by a circle containing the letter \"C.\"\n\n>A **Class D** fire extinguisher is used on combustible metals, such as magnesium, titanium, sodium, etc., which require an extinguishing medium that does not react with the burning metal. Extinguishers that are suitable for Class D fires should be identified by a five-point star containing the letter \"D.\"\n\n>A **Class K** fire extinguisher is used on fires involving cooking media (fats, grease, and oils) in commercial cooking sites such as restaurants.\n\nFor home use, you want to have a class ABC extinguisher which is suitable for ordinary combustibles, small amounts of flammable liquids, and electrical equipment.  \n\nAlso, EMSK, the method for using an extinguisher is best remembered by PASS: Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep.  Pull the pin, aim the extinguisher at the fire, squeeze the trigger, sweep the base of the fire.  If you have to use an extinguisher, don't position yourself so close that you blast burning debris into the air.  Stay back from the fire, and don't turn your back on it.  \n\nEdit:  Note that these classifications are for the U.S. Other destinations are used elsewhere, but the point stands.  Know the fire classification for your country and always use the appropriate extinguisher for your fire.

", "id": "d1falwq"}, {"comment": "EU and AU both use A-F with exception EU doesnt have E but does its just not classified as E, For the US E is C which is electrical fires.\n\nAmerica always gotta be fucking different drives me nuts as a American. A-F seems a much easier to remember system then having two B and a K but no E or F. While a small detail as we have all the same extinguishers its far easier to remember A-F and their purposes. I still call them A-F as when i was on the local fire department i used online sources for the tests and grew accustomed to it, but we had to learn both anyways for some reason.\n\nClasses for EU and AU are same list as above but instead go down starting with A-B-C-D-E-F instead of A-B-B-C-D-K, yes there should be two B one is for liquid and one for gas, the extinguishers will have seperate logos on them if they are even different for some reason (can usually use the same one on both i believe but been many years since i used any extinguishers).", "id": "d1fn41e"}, {"comment": "Except there are different classes in different countries (largely similar but not the same - some have more classes than others).

Adding to the poetry thing, don't be overly religious or quote the holy book too much. If you are VERY religious AND the deceased was as well it's fine to touch on this, but don't make it the only focus of the eulogy. Most of the time it looks desperate, sort of along the lines of 'those who cant think quote,' and it just becomes uncomfortable.\n\n3. Seriously, keep it short. I've seen people i love get up there prepared to speak for 25 minutes, lose steam, and just start skimming their notes. Make a sentence outline and practice it 3-4 times. It should be around 5 minutes. \n\n4. Ask for an opinion. When i did this for my grandmother i ran it past my sister first, definitely a good idea.

First thing to do is always check if there's enough oil (check your dipstick). If there is... Sometimes the light will come on because of a bad oil pressure sensor and there would be no problem with driving the car until you get it fixed if that's all it is, but the pressure would need to be confirmed with a manual gauge first. Other times (slightly more likely) the light is doing it's job and telling you the engine isn't getting proper oil pressure for one of many reasons. If this is the case, immediately turn off your engine and do not start it again until the problem is resolved. Running without proper oil pressure for even very short amounts of time (if it's low enough) will cause the engine to seize and it'll need to be completely rebuilt or replaced.  Never worth any situation where you need to keep it running for a few more seconds until it turns off anyway.

It's connected to two different sensors that also could be the problem. Does it happen going around turns, parked on an incline, or when the oil could be sloshing around? If not, it's definitely one of those sensors or the computer. If you have an OBD2 scanner that can read live data, you can enable logging and drive around, then after, check to see which of these sensors are changing state when the light flashes. If the problem is the computer then one or both of the sensors may just not be reporting data at all. Most good shops should be able to test it for you like that, or for 25 bucks you can get a bluetooh obd reader (read reviews) and the app 'Torque' to connect to it and log the data.

In this case, an \"open-ended\" straight draw, because either a 5 or a 10 will give you a straight.  (If the board flopped 5 and 7, only the 6 would give you a straight, and that's called a \"gut-shot\" straight draw). \n\nFor a full house, as the other commenter noted, if you are \"drawing\" to a full house, you already have either two pair or three of a kind, which are decent hands in their own right (depending on how the board looks).  \n\nBest case is you have a pocket pair (say two Jacks) in your hand, and the board flops J 2 4.  You have trip Jacks, and are technically \"drawing\" for a full house on the turn and the river, but you are already pretty happy with your three Jacks.  \n\nBest best best case is one if your buddies has Ace + King of hearts, and on that board the J and 2 are also hearts, so your opponent drawing for a flush (also called the \"nut flush\" because he's drawing to the highest possible flush, ace-high).  Then on the turn, the 4 of hearts comes out, giving him a flush, and you a full house (J J J 4 4).  He will know that he doesn't have the best possible hand, because a full house is possible when the board is paired, but he might not suspect that you have it because you'd need JJ, 22, or J2 to have one.  \n\nThis is when you put on your best poker face, check to him (or make a modest bet if you raised pre-flop and bet the flop--don't want to look suspicious!), and let him bet/raise the turn, then just call him.  On the river, you check, let him bet, then you raise.  If he's super loose, you go all-in (make it seem like a bluff!), but you want to bet an amount that you think he'll actually call, because all you can do at this point is get more money if he calls.  Making him fold means you didn't extract all the money you could have.  Then you collect all those sweet, sweet chips, and rub it in his face for the rest of the night.

Note that the money usually is split between the top players, for example 50% to the winner, 30% to second and 20% to third). \n\nThe basic rules are like this:\n\n* One person is the dealer, and deals two cards to every player on the board. \n* The person after the dealer pays the small blind (before he/she has seen their cards).\n* The person after the small blind pays the big blind (normally twice the amount of the small blind, also pays before cards are seen). \n* From here on, everyone acts one by one, starting with the one after the big blind. All players have three options \n 1.  Fold the cards\n 2. Call (always matching who ever has put in the most at the moment, from the beginning that would be the big blind).\n 3. Raise/bet. Put in how ever much you want, normally you are never allowed to bet less than the big blind.  \n* This goes on as many rounds as it takes, until at least two people have put the same amount on the table. As soon as all players have the same amount on the table, the flop is given. (This means that, for example, if you have raised and someone has called you, you do not get to act again and raise more. Only the big blind can do this (the first time he/she gets to act), i.e. if all players calls the big blind, so all players have the same amount of money on the table when the big blind is about to act, he/she can still raise)\n* When it is time to give the flop (the first three open cards), the dealer normally discards one card, then put three cards on the table. \n* After the flop is out, all players act again, this time starting with the first person after the dealer. Still with the same three options as before, but since no one pays any blinds this time, everyone can just check, and the round goes over to the turn (the fourth open card).\n* The turn works the same way. The dealer discards one card, then puts a fourth card on the table. The person after the dealer acts first again. \n* The last card, called the river, works the same way as the flop and the turn. When this round is over, you show your cards, and the best hand wins the pot. \n\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind. One thing is that what counts is the best five card hand. This can sometimes be the five cards on the table. Lets for example say the they five cards on the table are 2,3,4,5,6 in clubs. It would then not matter if one of you have two aces and the other has a 2 and a 7 off suit. Both players would still have the same hand, the straight flush on the table, and the aces doesn't count any more. A more common example of this is if there are two pairs on the table, and one high card. For example 2,2,5,5,A. As long as no one has either a 2,5 or an A, or a better pair than one of the table, all players would have the same hand. In this case, the pot would be split equally between all remaining players.\n\nAnother thing is that all players don't have to show their cards at the end. Lets say that there's only two people left on the river, and one of them bets. If the other person calls, only the person who initilly bet have to show his/hers hand. If the person who called realize he/she lost, he/she does not have to show the hand.\n\nOne last thing, if you play a tournament game, the blinds would steadily get higher. \n\nLastly, regarding the size of the blinds. The big blind should be about 1/100th of the the starting stack. \n\n\nEdit: Sorry for bad grammar/spelling.

The thing that confuses me is the specifics for the ante, raising a bet, calling etc. I know enough to play a game with them. We played with skittles a few times but I've been given a proper poker set and want to teach them the proper rules", "id": "d6l7q1e"}, {"comment": "Assuming you're just playing a friendly game of poker, it's pretty straightforward:\n\n1) An ante is optional -- basically a way to ensure that everyone has some skin in the game which in turn increases the likelihood that players will stay in. The ante can be any amount (usually something pretty small) and can be paid by each player, just the dealer (assuming the deal passes each hand), or by the players in the blind(s) if playing a more advanced game where the ante increases as the tournament moves on.\n\n2) Once the cards have been dealt, the player to the dealer's left (he/she who was dealt to first) is given the first opportunity to check (pass) or bet. If this player checks, the opportunity to bet then passes to the player to their left, and so on. If all players check, the game moves on to discard & draw, next card being dealt, etc. depending on the game being played. Once someone bets rather than checks, it is now up to the player immediately to their left to do one of three things: call (match) their bet, raise (meet their bet and add some more, which will set the new total amount that must be met by all players who wish to stay in the game), or fold (drop out). This can seem a little confusing, but so long as you remember that ultimately everyone has to meet the highest amount bet in order to stay in the game it's not too difficult. A quick example of how this works:\n\nThe dealer (Dan), deals a hand to Amy, Bob, Carol, and himself. Since he dealt to Amy first, she gets the first opportunity to bet, but she isn't sure about how good her hand is, so she checks the bet. Bob does the same, but then Carol opens the betting for $5. Dan now has to either call Carol's bet or raise it or else he has to fold and drop out of the hand. Let's say he folds. It's now up to Amy to make the same decision, and in her case, she decides to call the bet and puts $5 into the pot. Bob, seeing that there are two other players willing to bet and feeling confident in his hand raises the bet to $15. Since Carol is next up (to his left), it's now up to her to either call Bob's bet and add $10 (bringing her total up to $15), raise the bet further (if she had a good hand and was lurking), or to decide that that's more than she wants to bet and fold (in which case she forfeits her $5 she's already bet to the pot). She decides to call and adds her additional $10 to the pot. Dan (the player to Carol's left) has folded, so now the decision to call/raise/fold passes to Amy, who at this point decides that her cards aren't good enough to warrant throwing another $10 in and folds, leaving Bob and Carol in the hand to discard & draw, get the next card dealt, etc. depending on what game's being played.\n\nA lot of friendly games set table limits on how much someone can raise, how many re-raises can be made, etc. (you could theoretically get into a showdown with someone where each person just keeps raising the other until someone is forced out due to lack of money to cover the bet), etc...when I play with my friends we pass the deal each hand and just the dealer antes so that there's less to remember as far as everyone putting in an ante.\n\nIf you're teaching your kids, starting out with a simple game of five card draw and incorporating a wild card after a few rounds to increase their chances of hitting a better hand (and learning what beats what) is a great way to start.", "id": "d6m8s0v"}, {"comment": "Thanks for this.

Most likely it will trip an overload on the compressor or the circuit breaker.  This, after completely destroying the compressor due to running with no oil.  If the overloads and breaker do not trip, it will run until it locks up.  But you should hear 'screaming' coming from the fridge when this happens.... :)\n\nIn this [pic](http://www.brewpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/brewpi-fridge-conversion-13.jpg), you can lay the fridge on 'our left' side.  The reason is the tube running to on the left of the compressor is the suction line, (think return to compressor)  The oil can drain into this line and we are not as concerned because when the compressor runs, it 'sucks' on this line thus puling any oil back into the compressor.  This happens rather quickly.\n\nIf the fridge is laid on 'our right' side, the oil drains into the condenser via the 'discharge line'.  When the compressor runs it 'pushes' to the discharge line.  Any oil in the condenser needs to travel through the entire system before getting back to the compressor.  Due to oil viscosity, lower temps in the evaporator, Expansion port sizes, (ie very small) it takes considerable time to get the oil back.  The compressor runs with low or no lube and locks up.\n\n\nWill laying a fridge on its side always fail on start up?

If they can say only the name we can't confirm because you could be a jealous lover/spouse/stalker calling all the hotels looking from someone who's hiding; if you can't give me the name then you're a scammer.\n\nBecause of this scam my hotel wouldn't allow the auto-operator to allow callers to enter a room number and be transferred to a room directly; we used to, but scammers will call the hotel and start entering random numbers until they luck out and reach a guest. One time we had a power outage and the system that blocked outside callers from direct dialing went down, and no one noticed.....it only took 4 days before scammers started targeting our guests.

And he was determined to take what he learned from the failed secret societies he'd been a part of, and create huge, moneymaker for himself. At the age of 35 he was hit by a car, and stuck in a hospital bed. He used the time designing a model for a fraternal organization. He had an idea for a hook, the thing to make his organization stand out from the rest. He'd seen *The Birth of a Nation* (which came out that year), and decided to have his organization be the KKK, an organization which had died out 40 years before. He'd never met anyone who had been in the original KKK. He didn't even seek them out to get details on how they did anything. He already had his organization structure in his head. He based the rituals and outfits of his KKK not on anything factual, but instead completely on what he'd seen in *The Birth of a Nation* (white costumes, shapes of the hoods, burning crosses). And eventually he made lots of money. Because every member had to buy the official hood from him. Every member had to buy all the official pieces and parts from him. Every lodge had to buy all the rule books and guide books and ceremonial and costumes and uniforms from him. They even had to buy special water from him to be used in the official ceremonies. And of course, he got part of every member's yearly dues.\n\nAnyway, in the South, the 'Blacks are our enemy' stuff worked. But he found that the same rhetoric didn't work in Texas or California, where people were much more upset about Mexicans; the same rhetoric didn't work in the northern cities, where people were much more upset about Jews and Catholics. \n\nSo Simmons turned the KKK into a body that fought against immigrants, Jews, Catholics, Blacks....\"I hate the same things you do\".

I think trigger point release works by a combination of \"milking\" metabolites out of the area and by neurological input (pressure = different sensation then the tightness in the area) and the combination of effects can help relieve some of that tension.\n\nAlso I'm not entirely sure that a \"release\" totally breaks up the knots - but I do think it can go a long way towards restoring normal muscular function and pain relief.\n\nFor short - there's a lot of science out there that basically says we're not entirely sure what happens, but it seems to be effective treatment for some people.", "id": "czvcrvl"}, {"comment": "Thanks so much.

One decision. One moment to ignore how you feel and take a risk. And part of what makes it risky is the idea that we aren't good enough, that what we say or do won't be good enough.\n\nSaying \"so what\" to that feeling doesn't mean you have good self-esteem, or that you have fixed anything. But it doesn't take self-esteem to do that. For some people it's anger, or being tired, or just wanting someone to notice you.\n\nI have terrible self-esteem. But I speak up in class, I argue with people. I won't usually do so outside of home or work, but when I do it with strangers, it's often because no one is speaking or I think someone Is wrong or hasn't mentioned something important.

These include Miyazaki and Kagashima, two of the larger beef producing regions.\n* \"American Kobe Beef\" is a marketing term used by some unscrupulous meatmen and cattlemen in the U.S. to try and capitolize on the mythos of Kobe Beef.  Almost all of this product is cross-bred multiple times to increase growth rates and yields.\n* Therefore, all Kobe Beef is Wagyu, but not all Wagyu is Kobe.\n\nFor more information on this part, see [two excellent series of articles from 2012 and 2014 from Larry Olmsted on Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2012/04/12/foods-biggest-scam-the-great-kobe-beef-lie/#7647d5fc34d7).", "id": "czcfti8"}, {"comment": "Grass-fed beef is also completely unsustainable for the planet.", "id": "czdfmyc"}, {"comment": "This can't be reitterated more. \n\nCalves stay with their mothers drinking milk and eating grass until they can be weaned, typically when they reach 450-700 pounds, depending on the breed.

Actually, byproducts like distillers grains and soybean hulls are some of the most common feeds because they're cheap.  And as far as field corn goes, it's much better utilized by cattle than by us.

They both espouse misguided theories about gender and they stop being merely theoretical and harmless when they're acted upon. In the case of feminism it's a belief that gender is entirely a social construct, and in the case of TRP, that it's almost exclusively biological. At best TRP operates under the assumption that current beliefs are to be exploited for personal gain, often at the expense of spouses, family or friends. \n\n> I can't deny that there's loads of stories about people turning their lifes around that I highly doubt would have been possible if those people didn't stumble upon trp.\n\nThat may be true, but the same could be said of religion.

It straightens the edge and prevents it from having to be sharpened too often, but an occasional sharpening is still required, especially with the cheaper knives.\n\nThe universal test for sharpness is if it can cut normal paper cleanly if held in the air. Hold a piece of paper between your fingers so it's vertical. Place the grip end of the edge near where you hold it. Now draw the blade across it.\n\nIf it doesn't cut at all, it's not sharp. It may be only partially sharp, often the center part is dull while the ends are sharp. It may have nicks, when it cuts the paper up to a certain point and suddenly tears you have a nick. All of this is corrected by sharpening with a stone, about the nick you have to decide if you want to keep it or if you want to grind it out. I find nicks unproblematic so I leave them be.\n\nThe steel on the cheaper knives will univerally have not very good edge retention (dulled or nicked easily) and/or can't be sharpened very well to begin with, so don't grind down the whole blade trying to get perfect results - you won't get the perfect, razor-sharp edge onto cheap blades.\n", "id": "cy90mmz"}, {"comment": "You don't actually slide the knife over parallel to the cut...

Under a microscope this will literally look like a razors edge.  Once you start using the knife, fibers in the steel start splaying out as if you've laced your fingers together with them pointing away from each other.  When you use a honing steel, you rearrange these \"fingers\" back into a point.  However, with enough use you simply wear away the sharp edge and you will be required to use a sharpening tool to remove metal to make it a point again.

Thirty-six percent of the sudden deaths were in-hospital cardiac arrest and 64% were out-of-hospital arrest [1]. About 18% of patients survive to discharge following in-hospital cardiac arrest [2,3], whereas only 2% to 9% of patients who experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survive to discharge [4\u20136]. Functional outcomes of survivors are variable, but poor-quality survival is common [7], with only 3% to 7% able to return to their previous level of functioning [8]. The prevalence of coma or persistent vegetative state among survivors represents an enormous burden on patients, their families, health care personnel, and resources. The economic impact of cardiac arrest was the subject of a cost-effectiveness study that compared continuing versus withholding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and ventilatory support after day 3. The estimated incremental cost of the more aggressive care strategy was $140,000 (1998 dollars) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for high-risk patients (three to five risk factors, 93% 2-month mortality) and $87,000/QALY for low-risk patients (zero to two risk factors, 49% mortality) [9]. The economic burden of survivors of anoxic brain injury also is great, with in-patient rehabilitation lasting a mean of 41.5 days and costing $44,181 per patient [10].

Here's how to really do it.\n\nTake 3 liters or so of water per person (preferably in a soft pouch with a wrap-around straw) and a water filter.  Carrying ice is really really dumb as it will sweat and soak your stuff.  If you need to keep something cold put it in a waterproof bag and anchor it in a river.  If you need to keep something frozen reevaluate if you actually need it.\n\nLanterns are nice for certain types of camping, headlamps are nice for all types of camping.  Carrying water jugs is pretty dumb though, they take up space and offer nothing since your water is already in collapsible bags.\n\nSleeping pads are much cheaper than inflatable mattresses, pack to roughly the same size, and are lighter.  If you want to sleep on a mattress you should reconsider camping, instead, mount a bigscreen TV on the roof above your bed and play a movie of stars and occasional nature sounds (bonus if you turn the thermostat way down for realism).\n\nCamp kitchen vs shoe organizer... HUH???  What am I supposed to do, roll up the shoe organizer and use it to start the camp fire on which I'll cook my food?  No.  Use real fire, or if that isn't allowed in your neck of the woods, a camp stove of an appropriate size for your party.  Turns out that's why camp kitchens exist.\n\nDon't waste weight/space on either fire starter or homemade fire starter, both are dumb, take a few cheap Bic lighters and find fuel there.  It's not rocket science.\n\nDon't take any rigid containers, that's added weight without added value (dumb!), ziplock bags do the same basic thing but are cheaper, lighter and more flexible (in both senses of the word).\n\nI'm going to skip the next three dumbs.\n\nHow to sleep warm: LAYERS.

It amounts to a shit load of unnecessary work (which is dumb).  Try this, give a person a ride on your shoulders and walk around the block.

If it had the inner foam insulation, or even one of those foam pads to lay underneath, that would separate it from the ground enough.\n\nThe reason that laying on the ground itself can actually be warmer (despite it being a giant heat sink) is because your body will still be able to heat up the first couple of inches of the dirt.

Inexperienced Joe will realize that an air mattress is not an ideal way to use half a pack and 15+ lbs.  I haven't needed a pad for a while, but I remember mine costing $50+ for lightweight, compactable, self inflating pad.\n\n4. Canvass shoe organizers are the hands-down best way to organize groups of small things - things that might fit in a backpack!

Your idea of tinder is more along the lines of \"firestarter.\"  This one just tells me you've chosen this post as an example of everything that's wrong with the world today, and you're going out of your way to fault find.  I found the fire one to be the best especially because of the estimates for how much wood you need, precisely the *opposite* of a rigid plan.  Jesus Christ man, I liked this one.\n\n9.  You obviously don't have kids.\n\n10. I would have added something to highlight how choosing a spot for your tent directly impacts the quality of your sleep - such as, its harder to sleep on a hill or on a tree stump you didn't see under leaves when you were setting your tent up.  \n\n11. It may be preference to a certain extent, but from a physics point of view, you want the majority of the weight of the pack *above* your center of mass (where the shoulder straps fit snugly to your body!), not behind it.  You will naturally try to correct for this by bending over to put the pack weight above your CoM, which is obviously a bad idea.\n\n12. Yeah that food section was wtf.  It might work, but that's *not* how you cook food if you're feeding me...\n\n13. For car camping I could see this as making sense.  You've got a bunch of boxes and bags of stuff that you don't want to \"pack exactly\" the way you brought it - just throw it in the tub or what ever.  Better to keep all your food in one place anyways, for a bunch of reasons.\n\n14. I have no opinion here.  I bought great gear because I hiked at least once a month for extended periods of time.  I don't understand why this should be incorrect, you just said it wasn't because \"when you camp like I do...\" To each their own!  I grew up camping with other campers, so if I didn't have a tool, someone else did.\n\n15. I used that \"change of clothes in a sock\" trick all the time, it's really great at keeping things organized!  One of the most important things to have on any camping trip is a spare change of *dry* clothes, no matter what conditions you're hiking in.  Changing clothes after hiking 8 hours is like being reborn lol.  And packing your clothes by how you use them instead of categorizing them by the type of clothing, it saves you a headache. \n\nCamping is something very near and dear to me.

Carrying water jugs is pretty dumb though, they take up space and offer nothing since your water is already in collapsible bags.\n\nSleeping pads are much cheaper than inflatable mattresses, pack to roughly the same size, and are lighter.  If you want to sleep on a mattress you should reconsider camping, instead, mount a bigscreen TV on the roof above your bed and play a movie of stars and occasional nature sounds (bonus if you turn the thermostat way down for realism).\n\nCamp kitchen vs shoe organizer... HUH???  What am I supposed to do, roll up the shoe organizer and use it to start the camp fire on which I'll cook my food?  No.  Use real fire, or if that isn't allowed in your neck of the woods, a camp stove of an appropriate size for your party.

Do not call dealerships asking what their best price is. They will not tell you what the absolute lowest price they will sell a car will be. If you call and then go in, they then know (or think) you are okay with that price. You need to go in to each dealership you intend to visit.\n1. **Do not let them know you are paying in full, or have arranged to pay for the car through your bank.** Car dealerships make a ton of money on the back end when you finance through them. Most dealerships will present you rough ranges of prices based on the term length. If your dealership does this, ask dumb questions about financing and make it seem like you don't know what you're doing; but focus on the price of the car. \"That doesn't seem to bad.\" \"I think I could handle a payment like that.\" \"whats the price of the car?\" If they think you are oblivious to the costs of financing and will be financing through them, they will be more inclined to appease you with a low price on the car because they think they will make a ton of profit on the back end. You could even ask if they offer extended warranties. **Edit:** You want to play stupid and make them think they can pull one over on you because you're an idiot who just wants to get the best price on the car but doesn't know anything else about how cars are sold. \n1. Visit the dealership the last week of the month. What others have said about this is correct.\n1. If you don't end up talking to the sales manager instead of the sales guy, you probably aren't getting the best deal.\n1. Be prepared to leave when they don't give you what you want, and then actually do it. Tell them to contact you when they are ready to sell a car. \n1. Know what you want to pay for the car. You need to have a number in mind. When you do the above and leave, they need to know what number they have to agree with to get you back in to sign. \n1. If you visit multiple places, follow the above steps, and no one contacts you afterwards, the number you had in mind was way too low. If they are willing to give you the number you had in mind without you leaving or talking to the sales manager, your number is too high. They will be willing to go lower to move stock on the lot then they will be to order or transfer the exact car you want; be flexible and know what they have."], [16, "There are about a dozen websites that will give you the invoice price, minus any rebates.  Instead of wasting time, you can pay the ~$35 and get that.  Away you go.\n\nCarcost Canada is what I would recommend, if your Canadian. \n\nAnd yes, I sell cars for a living. "], [15, "As a former automotive salesman I would also like to point out there are times when car dealerships are more inspired to make stupid deals in the customers favor. They are given sales targets by the manufacturers each month along with special monthly incentives. If by the last week of the month they have not hit their target, then the deals get better for the customer. There are quarterly targets as well, and year end targets. The last two or three days of the month, quarter, or year are good times to get great deals. Leave new car fever at home, and be willing to walk out without a car; dealerships count on the average customer wanting to leave in a new car no matter whether it was a good deal for them, or a good deal for the dealership. Believe me dealerships have ways of making money on vehicles they sell below invoice, even if you don't buy a single thing in F & I. One last tip, unless you pay cash for your new car, always buy gap insurance. "], [9, "One should not buy new car- Dave Ramsey "], [5, "Also don't mention your trade-in until you've already negotiated the best price."], [7, "This largely reads like it was written by a car salesman looking to sucker people in. For instance it seems like getting preapproved is a good idea. Except that from a salesman's perspective they are much happier when you have the cash in hand burning a hole in your pocket. Car salesmen are very very very very good at making you think that you are winning as they rape you a new screw hole. This is why they appear to be one of a few different types of characters. The slick d-bag with 2 brain cells. The priestly doufus who's suit doesn't fit. The incompetent failed little league manager in the Walmart rain jacket. They want you to think that you can outwit them. They want you to use one or two tricks you read on the internet as they gang bang your bank account. This is what they do all day every day. It is also Darwinian; the scummiest survive, the honest and slow witted don't. Every day they are shown who is the best, and who is headed for the door. Thus they observe the best. They also closely watch their competitors to figure out any new tricks they are pulling. \n\nOften in negotiations the concept is Win-win. But that only applies when you are dealing with someone in a long term relationship. When dealing with carsalesmen and real-estate agents you want screw them at least as hard as they want to screw you. Except again, they will set you up so that you think that you are screwing them as they play monkey in the middle with your wallet. This is the key to any con, they play on your greed.\n\nThen the advice is to be prepared to spend all this time. Sort of. When you finally go to the dealer of choice you should be prepared to spend very very little time. Ideally you have talked to the sales manager to make the deal. He is 100% happy to screw some salesman out of a commission. If the price you are offering has been well researched as to being a good offer based on similar sales in your area (there are sites for this) then he will accept it with little or no negotiation. He wins because of the lack of a commission to be paid out. He also has no time to screw with you when you get there so you will buy the car and leave. If he hands you off to a salesman they will get the commission.\n\nKeep in mind that one of the most potent sales techniques is to wear you down. They will just stall you for hours and hours until they break your will and you will do whatever to get out of there. They work at least 8 hours a day so keeping you there for an entire shift is fine by them.\n\nYou therefore set a deadline and tell them that you will leave if they haven't sold you the car by then. This can be avoided if you can deal directly with the sales manager. \n\nThen when you seem to have a price and an agreement, they are still out to screw you. Pretty much the only thing you legally need to sign to buy a car is the documents to transfer the title. They will have yards and yards of documents for you to sign. One of the most critical documents is that you agree to binding arbitration in the event of a dispute. You don't have to sign this. You don't have to fill in warranty documents, you don't have to sign anything that isn't a government document that transfers the title. \n\nIf they give you anything else to sign you throw it back in their face. They are being gigantic assholes trying to get you to sign other things so feel free to be a gigantic asshole back. If they squawk that you won't sign then don't buy. As you walk out they will change their minds if you are completely clear that you are prepared to buy but 100% not willing to sign shit. They will get some grief from the owner or general manager for this but the dealerships really hate when you go to another dealer. \n\nAlso many dealers of a single brand are owned by a single family. Thus threatening to cross town might not be enough. Say that your office often has you in a reasonably close city and you are perfectly happy to buy there. Losing a sale is bad, losing a sale to those dickwads (all other dealers are dickwads to them) is worse.\n\nThen when you buy the car remove all their dealer stickers before the paint around them fades. When you go in for any warranty work make sure to tell them that if they replace the stickers you will have any such vandalism removed at their expense.\n\nA few games you can play: buy at the end of a month. Buy at the end of a month of shitty weather. Buy at the end of a shorter month February being the best. This is because of sales targets and whatnot. \n\nOr you walk into a Tesla store and just buy the tesla for the set price in 15 minutes without being jerked around by a bag of shit.\n"], [4, "Last time I bought a car, I took the day of work, brought a book, and packed a lunch. \n\nDuring negotiations they kept talking about time sensitivity, to try to hurry me along. When I went out to grab my lunch I explained that I'd anticipated it might take a while, so I took the week - a lie, of course - off work to focus on this. \n\nLol, the look on their faces... I got to talk to the sales manager in the next five, ten minutes at each of the four dealerships I did this at. "], [6, " Much of what has been said applies (have your financing lined up, don't mention a trade in).  But my advice is not to negotiate with 'a' dealership.  \n\nHere's what I do:\n\n* Decide on the type of car I want\n* Test drive and make a firm decision on a model (don't discuss buying a that point)\n*  Be flexible on color/interior.  \n* Contact multiple dealerships for the model in your area.  A phone call is preferred.  Talk to the fleet representative if you can.\n*  Say you want their best out the door price for the given model (preferably without regard to color).  Mention that you are contacting other dealers.  \n*  Say you will go with the best price given from all the dealers.  They will have one, and only one, chance to meet or beat the best price (single round of \"auction\" if you will).\n*  Do just that.  Then mention your financing situation and trade-in.\n\nSince they don't know what the others are going to say (and what situation the other dealerships are in) they are motivated to give their lowest price.  They will view you as a \"marginal sale\" which gets them some profit, but will get them closer to their monthly quota.\n\nI wouldn't recommend so many dealerships that it is difficult to handle the negotiations.  Make sure you are available to them for some reasonable queries.  If you are nice, but direct and firm, they will be more likely to work with you.\n\nNote: this method works well for common makes/models.

This was $30 more than we were currently paying for her car.\n\nThe dealer started negotiations at $120/month more.  I told him that's impossible.  Need to keep the payment down to $30/month more.  Here's the ensuing conversation:  S=salesman, M=me.\n\n> S: \"Well you're getting a bigger car!\"\n\n> M: \"So?  I told you I can't afford anything more than $x.  I have 6 months on my lease.  I am in no rush for a new vehicle.\"\n\n> S: \"Well we can get you down to $50/month more, we can't go any lower.\"\n\n> M: \"Nope.  $30/month. or I walk.\"\n\n> S: \"It's just the price of one cup of coffee a day to pay the $50/month more.\"\n\n> M: \"Okay [wife], let's pack up the kids things and go.\"\n\n> S: \"Wait, let me check something.\"  -- Comes back a minute later at $30/month. \n\n> M: \"Great!  Let's sign the papers.\"\n\n> S: \"Okay, but we had to move you down to the base model.\"\n\n> M: \"No.  I just negotiated price for the vehicle I just test drove.  I'm not leaving in any other vehicle other than the one I currently lease, or the one that we just test drove.  End of story.\"\n\nMagically we got it for the price that I was willing to pay, and they paid off the rest of the lease, and we got a 40\" TV (that was the promotion going on at the time, too).\n\nIt's amazing how when you have the ability to walk away things happen.", "id": "d27hy8i"}, {"comment": "I always feel like these conversations are strongarming the dealer into bending over backward but then again this is exactly the climate that they created.", "id": "d27lh3r"}, {"comment": "They would not make a deal that loses them money.

Do not call dealerships asking what their best price is. They will not tell you what the absolute lowest price they will sell a car will be. If you call and then go in, they then know (or think) you are okay with that price. You need to go in to each dealership you intend to visit.\n1. **Do not let them know you are paying in full, or have arranged to pay for the car through your bank.** Car dealerships make a ton of money on the back end when you finance through them. Most dealerships will present you rough ranges of prices based on the term length. If your dealership does this, ask dumb questions about financing and make it seem like you don't know what you're doing; but focus on the price of the car. \"That doesn't seem to bad.\" \"I think I could handle a payment like that.\" \"whats the price of the car?\" If they think you are oblivious to the costs of financing and will be financing through them, they will be more inclined to appease you with a low price on the car because they think they will make a ton of profit on the back end. You could even ask if they offer extended warranties. **Edit:** You want to play stupid and make them think they can pull one over on you because you're an idiot who just wants to get the best price on the car but doesn't know anything else about how cars are sold. \n1. Visit the dealership the last week of the month. What others have said about this is correct.\n1. If you don't end up talking to the sales manager instead of the sales guy, you probably aren't getting the best deal.\n1. Be prepared to leave when they don't give you what you want, and then actually do it. Tell them to contact you when they are ready to sell a car. \n1. Know what you want to pay for the car. You need to have a number in mind. When you do the above and leave, they need to know what number they have to agree with to get you back in to sign. \n1. If you visit multiple places, follow the above steps, and no one contacts you afterwards, the number you had in mind was way too low. If they are willing to give you the number you had in mind without you leaving or talking to the sales manager, your number is too high.

I also feel like it might hinder my ability to bargain as they will also know that what I'm looking for isn't super common.  Any advice on how to work it best in my favor?  I will likely do online shopping anyway, but just trying to figure out the best way to get a decent deal.  FWIW My old car is ~10yrs old and according to KBB is worth ~$2,000 dealership trade or $2,500 via P2P sale.

For instance it seems like getting preapproved is a good idea. Except that from a salesman's perspective they are much happier when you have the cash in hand burning a hole in your pocket. Car salesmen are very very very very good at making you think that you are winning as they rape you a new screw hole. This is why they appear to be one of a few different types of characters. The slick d-bag with 2 brain cells. The priestly doufus who's suit doesn't fit. The incompetent failed little league manager in the Walmart rain jacket. They want you to think that you can outwit them. They want you to use one or two tricks you read on the internet as they gang bang your bank account. This is what they do all day every day. It is also Darwinian; the scummiest survive, the honest and slow witted don't. Every day they are shown who is the best, and who is headed for the door. Thus they observe the best. They also closely watch their competitors to figure out any new tricks they are pulling. \n\nOften in negotiations the concept is Win-win. But that only applies when you are dealing with someone in a long term relationship. When dealing with carsalesmen and real-estate agents you want screw them at least as hard as they want to screw you. Except again, they will set you up so that you think that you are screwing them as they play monkey in the middle with your wallet. This is the key to any con, they play on your greed.\n\nThen the advice is to be prepared to spend all this time. Sort of. When you finally go to the dealer of choice you should be prepared to spend very very little time. Ideally you have talked to the sales manager to make the deal. He is 100% happy to screw some salesman out of a commission. If the price you are offering has been well researched as to being a good offer based on similar sales in your area (there are sites for this) then he will accept it with little or no negotiation. He wins because of the lack of a commission to be paid out. He also has no time to screw with you when you get there so you will buy the car and leave. If he hands you off to a salesman they will get the commission.\n\nKeep in mind that one of the most potent sales techniques is to wear you down. They will just stall you for hours and hours until they break your will and you will do whatever to get out of there. They work at least 8 hours a day so keeping you there for an entire shift is fine by them.\n\nYou therefore set a deadline and tell them that you will leave if they haven't sold you the car by then. This can be avoided if you can deal directly with the sales manager. \n\nThen when you seem to have a price and an agreement, they are still out to screw you. Pretty much the only thing you legally need to sign to buy a car is the documents to transfer the title. They will have yards and yards of documents for you to sign. One of the most critical documents is that you agree to binding arbitration in the event of a dispute. You don't have to sign this. You don't have to fill in warranty documents, you don't have to sign anything that isn't a government document that transfers the title. \n\nIf they give you anything else to sign you throw it back in their face. They are being gigantic assholes trying to get you to sign other things so feel free to be a gigantic asshole back. If they squawk that you won't sign then don't buy. As you walk out they will change their minds if you are completely clear that you are prepared to buy but 100% not willing to sign shit. They will get some grief from the owner or general manager for this but the dealerships really hate when you go to another dealer. \n\nAlso many dealers of a single brand are owned by a single family. Thus threatening to cross town might not be enough. Say that your office often has you in a reasonably close city and you are perfectly happy to buy there. Losing a sale is bad, losing a sale to those dickwads (all other dealers are dickwads to them) is worse.\n\nThen when you buy the car remove all their dealer stickers before the paint around them fades. When you go in for any warranty work make sure to tell them that if they replace the stickers you will have any such vandalism removed at their expense.\n\nA few games you can play: buy at the end of a month. Buy at the end of a month of shitty weather. Buy at the end of a shorter month February being the best. This is because of sales targets and whatnot. \n\nOr you walk into a Tesla store and just buy the tesla for the set price in 15 minutes without being jerked around by a bag of shit.\n", "id": "d27ek34"}], [{"comment": "Last time I bought a car, I took the day of work, brought a book, and packed a lunch. \n\nDuring negotiations they kept talking about time sensitivity, to try to hurry me along.

A phone call is preferred.  Talk to the fleet representative if you can.\n*  Say you want their best out the door price for the given model (preferably without regard to color).  Mention that you are contacting other dealers.  \n*  Say you will go with the best price given from all the dealers.  They will have one, and only one, chance to meet or beat the best price (single round of \"auction\" if you will).\n*  Do just that.  Then mention your financing situation and trade-in.\n\nSince they don't know what the others are going to say (and what situation the other dealerships are in) they are motivated to give their lowest price.  They will view you as a \"marginal sale\" which gets them some profit, but will get them closer to their monthly quota.\n\nI wouldn't recommend so many dealerships that it is difficult to handle the negotiations.  Make sure you are available to them for some reasonable queries.  If you are nice, but direct and firm, they will be more likely to work with you.\n\nNote: this method works well for common makes/models.

Thank you for clicking on my video and visiting my channel. Today I'm going to be showing you how to sew on a button. Now, this might seem really simple to do, but it isn't. I used to mess it up all the time before i started using this new method i learned and it's been requested in the comments a bunch of times that I share this method with you.\n\nSo what we're going to be doing is taking this thread, this button, this needle, and this toothpick and sew it onto this shirt. This is a shirt my grandmother left me before she died but the button popped off and I don't want to take it to a tailor because I'm afraid they'll mess it up. So we'll take these items and sew it onto this shirt right here.\n\nFor this tutorial I'm going to be using a blue shirt with white buttons and a white thread. Of course, for your purposes these don't have to match what I'm using, I'm using this because that's all I have for now. I do have to remind you that before we proceed that the needle is very sharp you you always want to be careful when using it; if you're a kid, make sure you have adult supervision.\n\nMost people when they want to fix a button they have they use some complex sewing machines that you probably can't afford or have the time to learn. My method is simple and very easy to use. So like, comment, and share my YouTube video and then hit the top right of the video to visit part 2 where we actually demonstrate this process.

Especially when they don't even know what that means in a lot of cases.\n\nYou turn into the slide to get traction back.  If you don't turn into the slide your tires are just sliding sideways.  When tires are sliding already you can literally push the car sideways.  (I've done it, guy spins the tires on ice (RWD) and I pushed the back of the car sideways.  He was stuck facing down hill into a tree.) \n\nSo, first order of business, get your front tires rolling in the same direction the car is moving.  Then, * **SLOWLY** * turn away from the slid.  I'm talking 3-4 second to turn the steering wheel 45 degs.  SLOWLY\n\nAnd finally, look where you want to go and steer toward it.  If you look at the concrete wall you're hoping to not hit, you're going to hit it.  Look well down the road and steer the car toward there.\n\nThat's what don't overcorrect means.  If you jerk the wheel over your just going to lose traction again.  If you brake, most of the braking force goes to the front wheel, and you'll just lose traction again.  \n\nFor the majority of drivers none of that is intuitive.  That's why any one that might encounter icy roads should absolutely find an empty parking lot full of snow and learn just how little traction you have.\n\nBut the scariest thing, is when your front end and back end start having a race, and the back end is winning.  When the front end looses traction the car will just push through a corner.  The steering wheel will do nothing.  When you step on the brakes you transfer weight from the back to the front, which pushes the front tires into the ground harder and restores some traction.  That's why every production car made is designed to lose traction at the front first.  But when the back end let's go first, pushing the brakes slows down the front and causes the back to lose more traction.  This will cause you to go from the back end coming around slowly, to something called snap oversteering.  It's every bit as bad as it sounds.  So, if you're driving a FWD and the back of the car loses traction, you need to roll onto the gas.  This will keep the front winning the race, and move some weight to the back to restore traction.

You want to get the tires rolling again.  Get some traction back, then try to use it.  A tire moving this way /--> is doing nothing but keeping the metal bits of the car off the ground.  Gas and brakes will do literally nothing.  Hopefully, when you get the tires rolling with the direction of travel again, there's enough traction available to turn the car.  If not, you're fucked.  Twice I've had to just let go of the wheel and wait for it all to be over.  It's a horrible feeling.  \n\nIf you let off the gas in a manual you'll cause the car to slow, which will cause weight transfer weight to forward.  A lot of times, that's just enough that it'll help the front wheels regain traction.  But it's risky.  I've had a car spin around 360 degrees solely because I let of the gas.  The car was pretty heavily modified though, so the suspension setup may have been a factor.  (Scared the hell out of my passenger, but I had clear road ahead and to the sides.  I just let it come back around, caught the slide and kept going trying to pretend like nothing happened.  We laughed a good long time over that.)  So, ideally, in a manual you should feather the gas just enough to keep the wheels going the at about the right speed for the road speed.  That's not easy.  For a novice in a manual car, just push in the clutch and let off the gas slowly.  \n\nI've never owned an automatic, but from what I understand of their operation, they wont lock the torque converter at low speeds.  You *should* be able to just let off the gas and worry about steering.\n\nThat's all for the fwd.  In a RWD, just let off the gas.  It'll slow the rear wheels helping to keep the back behind the front, which is surprisingly important, and it'll send a little weight forward which should help the front wheels regain traction.", "id": "dax5tz2"}, {"comment": "Another trick I learned for FWD cars: pump the *gas* pedal while steering into the skid.

People will say, \"All the positive attention comes from the fact that YOU are more confident and people notice it. That you are more secure, so it rubs off on people!\" When in reality, I think the confidence is the byproduct of the positive affirmations with follow the halo effect. Basically, people are more confident when they get into shape, because other's perceive you better, thus you start a positive feedback loop of becoming more confident on top of being on shape, thus receiving even higher confidence boosts. \n\nI think the same is true with mannerisms. Sure, these mannerisms could make YOU feel better, but more importantly, we are social creatures, and OTHERS start adapting their behavior (This person is acting in a way that a confident person would act, so they must have reason to be confident, so I am going to assume there is a known unknown as to why they are confident and treat them accordingly).

Volts = water pressure and amps = how much water is coming out. \n\nIf you use cheap cables, then chances are the wire in them isn't large enough to carry the current (water) through the cables (hose), through the frame (up the hill), and into the battery (tub). Just like how bad water pressure isn't going to let the water travel up the hill.  So shortening the distance (cable to battery instead of cable to frame to battery) was like eliminating the hill in your yard. \n\nIn less ELIF terms, the cheap jumpers couldn't carry the voltage required to push through the frame of the van. The entire frame and the cables themselves act as resistor.\n\nIf the cables wasn't the issue then it was the power source feeding the cables. A 12v is always 12volts, but if it's not big enough to produce enough amps then power won't push through and charge the dead battery sufficiently. \n\nOften times when a smaller car is trying to jump start a larger truck, you'll have to rev the engine pretty high while the cables are attached. This gets the alternator spinning faster, producing more amps, but it will always be pushed out at a 12volt pressure.

The donor battery acts as a sort of capacitor for the alternator, so all that would happen would be that the alternators amperage output would increase for a short period of time. It's nothing outside what a modern electrical system can handle.\n\nWhere it can start to do some damage is if the dead vehicle is not starting but keeps cranking repeatedly. I mean, the starter is turing at full power but it doesn't fire up and the person just lays on the key, letting the starter go and go and go. Eventually, you're no longer working off of the batteries and you're drawing straight from the alternator. That can cause premature wear on the alternator, but really it's more likely that you'll burn out the starter before you do damage to an alternator.\n\nLastly, the procedure Honda calls for is by far the safest and most correct; however, if a vehicle requires a jump start, there is a decent chance that the battery may not be able to hold a charge. Still, if you have a working alternator, all you need is the initial amperage to get you going so you can get to the shop. You'll have to leave the cables to make that happen.\n\nTL;DR: Honda is right, but if a battery is truly dead, the procedure won't work and you'll need to keep the cables hooked up.

As soon as you have both clamps on the donor car, you could be making a spark if the opposite ends are too close together (or close to a conductor). Personally, I hold both clamps in one hand with a good gap between the metal bits, and connect the other two clamps to the donor car with my other hand, then go and hook up the dead car as shown. That way, the negative cable (#4) isn't just hanging out somewhere hopefully not moving while connecting #3. \n\n* Turn off your damn stereo, headlights, etc. All these take precious current from being able to start your dead car on the donor's battery. \n\n* If you had to jump start your car after it seemed like not that long of sitting with your radio/headlights on, your battery might be nearing the end of its useful life.

Use it to choke yourself while you masturbate in your broom closet you sick fuck.\n\n**Granny knot:** This is what you get the first two times you try to tie a square knot and fuck it up. \n\n**Sheep shank:** An actual knot EMSK. Use it to shorten rope. It doesn't take too much pressure but if you put another secure rope through those two end loops it can hold down a trailer load.\n\n**Square knot:** Another knot EMSK. Turns two pieces of equally thick rope into one. Use it to tie together the ends of your ugly-ass shark tooth necklace.\n\n**Bowline:** Every sailor knows this but you should definitely know too. You know in movies where some dumb cunt falls down a cliff and is just hanging on to a rock and their mates have to send down a rope for them to grab onto and rescue them? If they knew how to tie a bowline with one hand they could have that rope around their waist as they got pulled to safety.\n\n**Sheet bend:** Same use as the square knot but for when one rope is thicker than the other. Use it to tie your larger, thicker penis to another man's smaller, thinner one to show dominance.\n\n**Overhand bow:** This is just an overhand knot with two ropes laying next to each other, like how your ex-girlfriend is laying next to another man *and wishing he was you, you stud.*\n\n**Carrick bend:** When you want to tie two pieces of rope together but they are too thick and inflexible to make the sharp bends of a square knot, such as when you are docking a boat, or docking your best mate.\n\n**Bow knot:** Good for tying your shoes when you get bored of how you learned to do it as a child. Also works for bikinis.\n\n**Figure eight double:** As described above. You might see this when people are belaying rock climbers.\n\n**Clove hitch:** When you want to tie a rope to a stick or spar this is generally the best way to do it. Tie a clove hitch around a thick branch, throw the branch into a strong tree above a river like a ninja grappling hook, and BAM you got a rope swing *but not a very good one*.\n\n**Half hitch:** *More like a half-assed hitch.* Actually it's incredible useful for a bunch of more complex knots, but on its own it's fairly useless. \n\n**Timber hitch:** Tie it round trees you fell with your big, manly arms to drag them back to camp. Add a half hitch to turn it into a Killick hitch.\n\n**Killick hitch:** Can stop the Timber hitch from rolling out when you drag your tree, or to tie rope to [odd shaped things] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/26/Killick_hitch.jpg/800px-Killick_hitch.jpg)\n\n**Halyard bend:** Also to tie rope to cylindrical things like spars, but get's really fucking tight and hard to undo. At least it looks nice.\n\n**Rolling hitch:** While the Timber hitch will let you drag a log behind you like a plow, the rolling hitch will let you drag it lengthways. Use it when you need to get large trees through a front door to play a prank.\n\n**Fisherman's bend:** For when you want to attach an anchor to a rope. Anchors are best used when attached to rope. *Bonus tip: attach said rope to your boat for extra usefulness.*\n\n**Two half hitches:** A good balance between being easy to undo and not untying under pressure. Use it to tie your dog to a street lamp while you go into a shop, or to tie your girlfriend to a street lamp while you go into your other girlfriend. *Wrap around the pole twice if it is thinner than your wrist, this is called a round turn and two half hitches.*\n\n\n**BONUS** *but not a very good bonus.*\n\n**Lark's head:** You already know what this is, it's not even a knot. It's crazy useful though, if a Lark's head breaks it's because your rope snapped. I used this for suspension bondage cause it's the only way to know 100% you won't let someone fall from the ceiling. \n\n**Cat's paw:** A Lark's head with extra twists. People use it for fishing to attach hooks I think.\n\n\nEvery other knot on this infographic is fairly useless to your average dude. Some are maritime and fishing knots, others are so intuitive that you don't need a guide. If you're going to need to use one of the complex ones you won't be learning from a .jpg on the internet, you've probably already spent a lot of time learning it in meatspace.

I'd like to say, though, that a square knot is really not great for making two ropes into one. It's just too unstable if it's in open space; I definitely wouldn't want to use it in any scenario where something valuable is on the end of one of the ropes. The sheet bend, however, is definitely up to the task. Even if the ropes are the same thickness. It's also less likely to capsize and become a bitch to untie.\n\nThe square knot is great for simple binding purposes; it's much more stable if it's actually *resting on* something. A good shoelace bow is effectively a double-slipped square knot (most people end up with a granny knot, though, which isn't as good).\n\nSource: geeked out on knot-tying for a solid year a while back", "id": "d0coqtt"}, {"comment": "Oh thank god someone else came here to say this. Here's the relevant quote from the Ashley Book of Knots:\n\n> 74\\. One of the best but most misused of knots is the REEF or SQUARE KNOT (#1204). Employed as a BINDING KNOT, to reef and furl sails or to tie up parcels, it is invaluable.  \n> 75\\. But employed as a bend (to tie two rope ends together), the REEF KNOT is probably responsible for more deaths and injuries than have been caused by the failure of all other knots combined.  \n> 76\\. In fact the ease with which it is capsized by jerking at one end is its chief recommendation as a REEF KNOT. Tied in two ropes' ends of different size, texture, or stiffness, it is almost bound to capsize and spill.\n\nHere's the five knots I think are actually worth knowing:\n\n1. Sheet bend. Excellent general-purpose bend, easily doubled if you need extra security.\n2. Bowline. Extremely versatile loop knot. Stable, can be untied after loading.\n3. Round turn and two half-hitches. Excellent general-purpose hitch, you can add extra turns if you need more friction, which means you can finish the knot even while the turns are holding a load.\n4. Rolling hitch. Not the one you see in the linked image (which is wrong), but the one described as ABoK#373. In case you don't have Ashley's magnum opus to hand, [this is what I'm talking about](http://www.animatedknots.com/imagesprelim/rolling_hitch.jpg). An excellent knot for tent guys, and other places where you want something strong against pulls in line with the thing you're hitching. I wouldn't put life and limb on it, though.\n5. Figure-8 knot. A decently bulky stopper, easily untied. Can be turned into a really secure loop if you forget how to tie a bowline.\n\nSource: sailor.\n\nEDIT: oh jesus christ the \"double carrick bend\" in the OP's image is totally wrong.

About anyone/anything ever. Discuss facts by all means but do not get into the office politics/gossip or you will paint a target on your back. \n\n3: Be assertive with your requests and workload. This gives you control over what you can control. \n\n4: Under promise and over deliver. Saying a project will take 1 week instead of a month will only reflect badly on you. Be honest with yourself and your boss and your clients.\n\n5: Ask politely many times to get what you want. Whether to sit in meetings, get a promotion, pay rise etc. No never means no in business unless it's completely unrealistic.\n\n6: GET INVOLVED IN THE OFFICE. Do coffee runs, ask around in other (nearby) departments, bring in snacks etc. If you foster team spirit in an active way YOU WILL be pegged as \"someone to watch\" follow it up with performance and you'll be earning more in no time. DO NOT do eveything for everyone you still have an actual job to do. Simply do what would be polite and not out of your way and you'll be golden. \n\n7: Make sure you know your reporting structure. Who gets to tell you what to do. If someone wants you to do something simply say \"I'm pretty swamped right now, run it by *bosses name* and see if they can clear some time on my timetable for you\". Who can complain about that response? It's measured, polite, and assertive. You didn't say no or anything else inflammatory and you've essentially just said \"that's not my job and there's no way I'm doing it unless I'm told to by my boss\" and gotten away scott free. Your boss has a responsibility to you and visa vis anything outside of your role or any extra work must be run passed them. Then it's up to your manager to say yes or no. If your boss asks you again say your swamped and you'd rather not. If you can do it though say your swamped but you'll find a way to fit it in (if you're not actually too busy). Welcome to being a hero.  \n\nUsing the above points you can mould the office into what you want over a few months. Being proactive, positive and polite is fresh to many bosses. Having clear set boundries means people know not to mess with you and you can manage yourself to a degree. Other than that don't cause a fuss, do your work and get paid. \n\nBe a leader and a *person* you'd want to follow and the rest will fall into place in about 3-8 months.

About anyone/anything ever. Discuss facts by all means but do not get into the office politics/gossip or you will paint a target on your back. \n\n3: Be assertive with your requests and workload. This gives you control over what you can control. \n\n4: Under promise and over deliver. Saying a project will take 1 week instead of a month will only reflect badly on you. Be honest with yourself and your boss and your clients.\n\n5: Ask politely many times to get what you want. Whether to sit in meetings, get a promotion, pay rise etc. No never means no in business unless it's completely unrealistic.\n\n6: GET INVOLVED IN THE OFFICE. Do coffee runs, ask around in other (nearby) departments, bring in snacks etc. If you foster team spirit in an active way YOU WILL be pegged as \"someone to watch\" follow it up with performance and you'll be earning more in no time. DO NOT do eveything for everyone you still have an actual job to do. Simply do what would be polite and not out of your way and you'll be golden. \n\n7: Make sure you know your reporting structure. Who gets to tell you what to do. If someone wants you to do something simply say \"I'm pretty swamped right now, run it by *bosses name* and see if they can clear some time on my timetable for you\". Who can complain about that response? It's measured, polite, and assertive. You didn't say no or anything else inflammatory and you've essentially just said \"that's not my job and there's no way I'm doing it unless I'm told to by my boss\" and gotten away scott free. Your boss has a responsibility to you and visa vis anything outside of your role or any extra work must be run passed them. Then it's up to your manager to say yes or no. If your boss asks you again say your swamped and you'd rather not. If you can do it though say your swamped but you'll find a way to fit it in (if you're not actually too busy). Welcome to being a hero.  \n\nUsing the above points you can mould the office into what you want over a few months. Being proactive, positive and polite is fresh to many bosses. Having clear set boundries means people know not to mess with you and you can manage yourself to a degree. Other than that don't cause a fuss, do your work and get paid. \n\nBe a leader and a *person* you'd want to follow and the rest will fall into place in about 3-8 months.

These two women came up to me and my friend and told me that there was a Flamenco dance in this square, and took out a poppy with a note attached it it. I said, \"Oh, thanks\" and tried to take the poppy. The woman was like, \"no, no, for good luck, you must trade me 1 penny for this flower\" I just thought, \"oooookay\", and reached into my pocket and handed her a penny. She handed it back and said, \"No, one from your purse.\"\n\nAt this point I tell my friend to check herself because this is getting weird, and this woman has an accomplice with her, meaning if we get too distracted by one, the other will try to take something. But I learned living in Europe for a couple months that if you're a girl and want to avoid scammers, keep your money in your FRONT pocket. Especially if you have a purse, they're not going to even think you'd keep money there. So I let her poke around in my purse, full of trash and receipts because I can't find a goddamn trash can in Madrid. She opens a pocket and tries sticking the poppy in, but is really obviously looking around in my purse. \n\nWhen she realized I had nothing valuable in my purse, she turned around and said something to me and my friend that I'm 90% sure was \"gilipollas\" lol. She didn't even give me the fake poppy, after all of that!\n\nAlso, that scam with the cashiers on their phones is incredibly common in Barcelona. I saw it almost everywhere. Remember, if you ever travel to Europe, CASH IS KING. Only use your credit card to hit an ATM and get Euro, then it doesn't matter after that. Free massage thing happens a lot on the beach in Barcelona. Best way to get them to go away is to take a 2 euro coin out of your pocket and try to barter for a 2 euro massage. If they think you're broke, they'll piss off. Also, pro tip, the guys selling Mojitos and Sangria ask for 5 euro for a tiny cup, but you can generally talk them down to whatever you have in your pocket. Almost every one will accept 2 euro, and I'd say about half accept 1 euro.\n\n I visited Rome and lived in Florence, and I never saw the gypsy kid thing happen.
