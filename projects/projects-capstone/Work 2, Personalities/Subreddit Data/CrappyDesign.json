We no longer use floppy disks except in rare circumstances, yet the save button still takes that shape because there is a great deal of uniformity in the software world so users only have to learn one iconic icon to know how to save in most programs, rather than having to figure out what a whole new set of hieroglyphics mean when they launch a new program.\n\nThe \"wheelchair on a button by a door\" icon is the same way.  You know that it will open the door.  Moving away from that graphic just because the original inspiration for the image is inapplicable is bad design.

It's an alphabet. Specifically, it's a substitution cipher over the ISO basic Latin alphabet, the Arabic Numerals, and a few other characters. All of the syntax, vocabulary, and semantics derive from the base language being encoded. Two English speakers communicating in Morse Code are still fundamentally, and cognitively, speaking and interpreting English.\n\nThe phenomenon you're talking about in the TBI patient is called [aphasia](http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/Aphasia/), and it's not uncommon for patients afflicted with it to lose the ability to speak, but maintain the ability to write (or vice versa). \n\nThe speed issues you cite stem from the fact that novices have to focus while mentally translating back to their native language (or in this case, decode to the Latin character set) in their head during comprehension, which slows them down. Experience just makes this process reflexive. Usage-based chunking strategies can speed this transition up, of course, but that doesn't make Morse Code a language just because learning to decode it in real time is similar to learning to understand a second spoken language.

Then I measured the dimensions of the watch screen in pixels which yielded me ~516 px X ~499.20 px. Then I measured the diameter which I took by measuring the entire height minus the extra bit at the top from the strap which gave me 801.01 px.\n\nThen I took to google in search for the average length of a male index finger unfortunately all I got was how the index finger measures testosterone and other garbage that I didn't need so I took the average length of the male middle finger which is 3.72 inches and assumed that that person had a 2D:4D of 1.\n\nI then found the value of inches to pixels by solving 3.72x = 236.65 which gave me that 1 inch is ~63.616 px. I took that number and converted everything into inches.\n\nThe dimensions of the watch turns out to be 8.11\" x 7.847\", the diameter is 12.591\" and the circumference is 39.557\".

Besides getting rid of the demons, this also flung poop everywhere, but those days had different standards for sanitation (do yourself a favor and read about the sanitation movement).\n\nAnyway we would spin these guys, it was called \"tavah\" in Aramaic, and pretty soon it was like, just the cool thing to do.  Until guess what?  No more demons.\n\nSo what did we do with their tongues?  Nothing...until we figured out we could sell them to the Romans.  For their playgrounds.

Only the best would do for the owner though, so he offered a LOT of money & Stubbs rolled his eyes & went Well OK then. He painted the horse as it would have looked after the race - covered in whip marks, bleeding, frothing at the mouth, exhausted. The owner was furious and demanded Stubbs fix it or not get paid. More eye-rolling and wheezing, and Stubbs started over, throwing in some random buildings and people, including selfie-arm boy, and cutting back on the horse's injuries. The painting's now worth many millions.", "id": "d77egse"}, {"comment": "Unsubscribe to horse facts ", "id": "d77er49"}, {"comment": "More Stubbs facts you say?

We had just come from playing airsoft so we were sitting in the far corner of the lot shooting lamp posts and signs with airsoft guns to kill time. As one might imagine, teenagers sitting in a parking lot aiming fairly real looking guns in random directions is a thing that gets the cops called on you. \n\nWe heard a bunch of sirens so we tossed the guns (like, a lot of guns) in the trunk of one of the cars, but it was too late. Cops rolled up, we were just sitting there listening to music. \n\n\"We got a report about kids with guns sitting on this side of the parking lot...\", one of the officers says.\n\n\"Oh, yeah, we were just airsoft guns blah blah blah story above\", we says.\n\nThe dulcet tones of The Mark, Tom, and Travis show are playing in the car.\n\nThe officer asks to see the \"gun\" we have, so my friend gives him one of the little pistols that was in the back seat. He looks at it, hands it to his partner, that guy looks at it, feels the weight, says something along the lines of \"Hell, apart from the weight, these things look pretty realistic.\"\n\nOfficer 1 asks if we had any more with us. We tell him that there are a few more in the trunk. \n\n\"Up, all night long, and there's something very wrong, I know it must be late, been gone since yesterday...\"\n\nMy buddy takes a step towards the car to turn down the music, he knows this album. \n\n\"STAY WHERE YOU ARE!\", the first officer suggests.\n\nHe stands still, knowing what is imminent. Cops open the trunk, there's like a stack of replica AKs, mp5s, a sniper rifle, etc and 2 12\" subs.\n\n\"SHIT PISS FUCK CUNT COCK SUCKER MOTHER FUCKER TITS FART TURD AND TWAT.\"\n\nThe song is only 30 seconds long. After about 25 seconds the officer goes, \"OK turn this shit off\" so my buddy walks over, reaches in the drivers side window...\n\n\"I FUCKED YOUR MOMMMMM\". *click*, turns the music off.\n\nSomeone sitting on the roof of one of the other cars starts laughing a little. Like that tense half giggle of we could get arrested but this is also funny as hell. \n\n\"DOES THIS SEEM FUNNY TO YOU?\" \n\n\"Mildly.\"\n\nSecond officer actually cracks a smile. First guy, obviously trying to hold his composure, lectures us about brandishing realistic-looking firearms in public and tells us to get the fuck out of here and never do that again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "d77xyok"}, {"comment": "https://youtu.be/MYmV70_U3oA", "id": "d77sj16"}, {"comment": "You're a real king in the making. https://youtu.be/xJvGE7Vvd4M", "id": "d778fcn"}, {"comment": "Torgue?

These guys *drank*. The garbage cans would be filled with empties on Monday mornings, and honestly I'm not sure how much work they could actually do once they'd gotten that hammered.\n\nWe come in one Monday morning and all hell is breaking loose. Some fuckin' idiot on the construction crew got thirsty for something besides beer, saw all these bottles of pretty-colored liquid on the shelves, and helped themselves, ending up in Emergency getting their stomach pumped.

There's also a lovely piece of US drug regulation history related to that. In the 1930s, Massengil began dissolving a strep throat drug in diethylene glycol (an antifreeze) to sell as an elixir. Before mass producing, they tested flavor & aesthetics but not toxicity--because toxicity testing wasn't required by law (snarky soapbox tangent: and why would it have been? clearly selling toxic drugs is bad for business and so market forces would snuff out businesses that sold toxic compounds...). Within a few weeks of being on market, the elixir was linked to the deaths of over a dozen children (and a few adults). More were ill for a few weeks (abdominal pain, kidney dysfunction, convulsions, etc.). Legally, the only law Massengil broke concerned labeling (by law a product marketed as \"elixir\" was a solution with alcohol, but Massengil's product contained 0% alcohol). Fast forward to the end of 1930s and Congress passed the Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act (1938) which, among other things, gave the federal government greater regulatory powers over pharmaceuticals (including requiring toxicity testing).

They were cheap as hell, so why not?\n\nI'll tell you why not!   \nThey are dangerous to use because they are designed so poorly.  \n\nStarting off with the thumb-blade.  It's on a spring that tries to push the blade back in, so if you slip you won't cut yourself because the blade will pop in.  The issue here is that the spring is incredibly powerful for the size so you're exerting a lot of pressure with your thumb.  This fatigues your whole thumb very quickly which makes using the tool very laborious.  \n\nThe blade itself is utter crap.  It's not replaceable at all and is very hard to sharpen because it's so small and at an awkward angle.  Speaking of sharpening; That's the first thing you have to do once you get the tool out of the packet - it's blunt as fuck fresh from the factory.  \n\nThe small blade at the front that you're meant to use to slide through the plastic to continue the cut you make with the small pop-out blade is also incredibly poorly thought out.  You see, because of the angle and the position of the blade, you have to hold your hand low to the package and push.  This leaves your knuckles exposed to take the full slicing edge of the plastic you've just sliced open, because the way the plastic of the tool deflects the plastic of the package.  It should be integrated into a hook, which one would pull to keep all the nasty shit away from one's hands.\nAnd again, the blade is total trash which is only good for a few uses.  \n\nFinally, the ergonomics of the tool itself are awful.

They were cheap as hell, so why not?\n\nI'll tell you why not!   \nThey are dangerous to use because they are designed so poorly.  \n\nStarting off with the thumb-blade.  It's on a spring that tries to push the blade back in, so if you slip you won't cut yourself because the blade will pop in.  The issue here is that the spring is incredibly powerful for the size so you're exerting a lot of pressure with your thumb.  This fatigues your whole thumb very quickly which makes using the tool very laborious.  \n\nThe blade itself is utter crap.  It's not replaceable at all and is very hard to sharpen because it's so small and at an awkward angle.  Speaking of sharpening; That's the first thing you have to do once you get the tool out of the packet - it's blunt as fuck fresh from the factory.  \n\nThe small blade at the front that you're meant to use to slide through the plastic to continue the cut you make with the small pop-out blade is also incredibly poorly thought out.  You see, because of the angle and the position of the blade, you have to hold your hand low to the package and push.  This leaves your knuckles exposed to take the full slicing edge of the plastic you've just sliced open, because the way the plastic of the tool deflects the plastic of the package.  It should be integrated into a hook, which one would pull to keep all the nasty shit away from one's hands.\nAnd again, the blade is total trash which is only good for a few uses.  \n\nFinally, the ergonomics of the tool itself are awful.  Uncomfortable to hold, awkward to use because it all requires a lot of force and risk.   It's just all around a shitshow.\n\nEven at $1, these things are a waste of money.", "id": "d5pc4gs"}, {"comment": "That is far more passionate review than I expected.", "id": "d5pcmkx"}, {"comment": "It just... pisses me off to my core that such a good idea is done with such poor execution.

But this kind of attitude among more liberal people really bothers me.\n\nAren't you not attempting to feel any empathy right now by telling them to just feel empathy and that that's how \"normal adjusted human beings\" are? While ignoring that unless they're some kind of very unique and rare human, and psychotic almost to the point of serial killer levels, then they certainly feel some kind of empathy.\n\nIf you have a problem with people using a word or displaying any kind of behavior, I find it a good idea to be empathetic of the fact that these people usually grew up with the word and it is part of their natural social vocabulary and part of their culture.\nOtherwise you tend to get pretty negative responses if you just mock their culture. \nIn my experience.\n\nI personally think to effectively asking people to change the way they naturally learned to speak in their subculture requires some empathy. I also very strongly believe that if you go with the potentially mentally and socially harmful method of coercion by changing someone by using social pressure and mockery, you need to bring the burden of proof with you.\n\nAnd a heavy burden of proof. \n\nSocial coercion by any kind of intimidation and mockery without being held to a burden of proof as to why you are justified in changing someone, and very likely causing some kind of mental and social harm on the person has been a gigantic problem among human society and culture throughout history, and is only recently being tamed.\n\nIf you think coercion by social mockery and intentionally causing unpleasant emotional reactions in people outweighs the harm it causes **and crucially is also efficacious** then I think people should be aware of the proof for it.\nEven if the answer and proof of why it's a good idea is totally obvious.\n\nPersonally though I find telling people why they are wrong, instead of implying they are some kind of abnormal human without empathy is a lot more effective anyways.\n\nThere actually have been studies that support my perception, that respecting peoples points of view and directly addressing them is way more effective then just mocking them.\n\nThere was a  pretty cool recent one about how conceding some point (even a minor one) as right to someone you are trying to convince to change, makes them far more likely to change and be persuaded to your point of view.\n\nEven if the point of view they switch to is completely at odds with their old views.\n\nI can look some of this stuff up for you if you would like me too.\n\n\n\nBut remember.\n\nThis is my point of view.\n", "id": "d8e4jkw"}, {"comment": "You're left-wing coal rollers.

Vent or return?", "id": "d7xcien"}, {"comment": "So, apologies, this may be more of an answer than you were looking for...\n\nA term like \"return\" is used in the context of the purpose of a termination in the duct system. So we refer to things like \"supply\", \"return\" (usually meaning that it's recirculated back into the main air system), \"exhaust\", etc. I'd be willing to bet a beer that this was intended to be an \"exhaust\", meaning the air would be exhausted directly (probably after traveling through a central exhaust duct) to the outside. The position of it being inside the shower (and therefore for the purpose of moisture removal) points me towards this conclusion.\n\nIn my experience in the commercial HVAC design industry (I specify this because I'd be less familiar with terminology used in residential HVAC design), I don't believe we ever used the word \"vent\". For what we would term a \"supply\" point, we would typically use \"diffusers\". Think of what you see overhead in typical [standard office building](https://www.titus-hvac.com/Products/Diffusers/TMS). These are things used to deliver the air in specific patterns. For return points and exhaust points, air spread is not important. They tend to be non-directional (simple experiment: you can blow out a candle, but you can't really suck out a candle).  So we use what are called [grilles](https://www.titus-hvac.com/Products/Grilles/350FL), which looks a lot like what was in OP's picture.\n\nSo, typical combinations of the above terms (use + design) results in phrases like \"supply diffuser\", \"return grille\", and \"exhaust grille\". Of course, the design engineer can use grilles for supply if they want, or diffusers for return, though it wasn't as common where I worked. Diffusers for return, specifically, tended to happen when the architect was interested in a more \"consistent\" look in the ceiling, i.e., using diffusers that all look alike even if their actual use was different. \n\nTwo final notes... 1) Engineering isn't science, especially HVAC engineering. There are a lot of ways to get the same thing done in a reasonable fashion, and folks might do things in different ways than what I've described. 2) I linked to Titus hardware just because that's what I was familiar with when I was working.

My beef is specifically in two camps:\n\n1.  I really don't trust the corporations driving it to be primarily concerned with long-term human well-being over profits, and I don't trust them to fully and thoroughly test the long-term effects of things like GMO plants which are bred to produce their own pesticides (which are theoretically safe for humans to eat) before releasing them on the market.  Many of these are the same corporations that have already had a shaky track record with safety standards and treatment of their consumerbase.\n2.  I absolutely detest the use of GMO genes to bully and force out of business competitors by using natural things like pollination as a weapon against surrounding farms.  Look at the way Monsanto has done it.\n\nGMOs are, in my opinion, dangerous until we have much more rigid GMO-specific regulations in action that force testing in GMO crops before release as a food product, and some sort of better stipulations on the patentability of GMO genes and preventive measures in place to prevent GMOs from being used as a weapon to force smaller farms out of business.", "id": "d5v9egm"}, {"comment": "Concerning your second point I had similar concerns but after reading some of [the discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/4v2393/soylent_takes_a_stand_for_science_proudly_made/d5uvrdr) on /r/skeptic it would seem that \"pro-GMO\" organizations like Monsanto aren't perhaps all that bad - there's just a lot of misinformation.", "id": "d5v9vrp"}, {"comment": "I'll definitely have to read more into that.  That definitely pisses me off a bit.  I hate being misinformed to that degree, and especially lied to by the people around me.  I'd been told that the other farmer had the crops because of cross-pollination, not that he had outright bought them.  And I'd been told that he had the option to cycle the crops, not that he had refused court orders.\n\nThat really pisses me off.  Just like that McDonald's coffee thing where it turned out that McDonald's was actually responsible and it wasn't \"just some lady who burned herself\".\n\nThanks for setting me on the right path.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "d89ht5q"}, {"comment": "TL;DRing at the beginning of a wall of text.

Therefore, you only ever need to type a backslash before every *second* asterisk (unless you're also italicizing words - to be safe, just type \"\\\\\\*\" *every* time you want an asterisk to display).\n\n- Since the backslash is also now read as a formatting tool, and is **not** used in pairs, you **must** type \"\\\\\\\" *every* time you want the backslash symbol to be displayed.\n\nSo, in order to display the \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af guy properly, you must type \"\u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\" - one extra backslash to break the italic formatting, and one extra backslash to break the backslash formatting.\n\nIn short, just keep adding backslashes to it and looking at the comment preview - it'll work eventually.", "id": "d89n6cc"}, {"comment": "> the underscore character (this one _ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy * )\n\nWell that doesn't make much sense does it.  \n\"we got this underscore, what do we do with it?\"  \n\"we'll just make it do what the asterisk does everywhere else on the internet\"", "id": "d89l9l5"}, {"comment": "Being used to Reddit and asterisks, I find Skype so confusing - you type \\*word\\* to embolden words, and \\_word\\_ to italicize them... ugh.", "id": "d89ndly"}, {"comment": "It's the opposite.

This swollen area is call the \"Bulbus Glandis\". Its is located towards the base of the penis.  During the act of mating, when the male dog enters the vagina of the female dog, this area swells up.  Once swollen, the dogs will be \"TIED\" together for upto 25min while the male is ejaculating.  This increases the changes of conception by sealing the semen in the uterus.

I worked at a gas station through college. Technically, I was the third shift manager. I was the only employee, though, so it doesn't really count for much more than the dollar raise it came with.\n\nFirst, gas stations do this if they are in extremely good locations. For example, there is one gas station inside of the property owned by the Orlando International Airport. Their gas can be as high as $9 a gallon at times. However, you have tons of rental cars coming to and from that location. If you don't fill your car up before returning it, the rental place will just take it to the closest gas station (the one on site) and just bill you for the gas. This way, the car rental place fills up on your dime and you have no choice in where the gas came from. And so, you get nailed.\n\nSecond, gas stations really don't make much on gas purchased. I believe our margin was around 1%. Gas stations really make their money on whatever they're selling inside. Obviously, convenience stores that don't sell gas are able to stay open. It's all about getting people in the door to buy inside stuff. \n\nIf you're in a neighborhood that people walk to/through or are on a high traffic road, people will stop to buy snacks and soda regardless of whether or not they're buying gas. I would say 90% of our customers there to buy gas weren't coming into the store to buy anything but their gas. There was a lot of foot traffic and people stopping to buy snacks or whatever, though.\n\nDealing with gas is a pain, a fill up to your underground tank can cost as much as $30,000. You really don't want to pay that out if you don't have to. \n\nLastly, gas stations are often times franchises. The one by you is probably owned by a franchisee that doesn't want to deal with spending all of that money on gas, so he keeps his prices high enough that what little bit he sells nets him a slightly larger profit. He's not counting on that 10% of people walking in the door that were buying just gas to buy other goods, he's just counting on his regular foot traffic and people stopping for things other than gas.\n\nTl;dr franchisee doesn't want to deal with pain in the ass gas for a small bump in customers.", "id": "cy30j5e"}, {"comment": "Maybe they have enough business from word of mouth, and/or have had bad experiences with idiots from the general public.", "id": "cy2rbui"}, {"comment": "Maybe they're smuggling Cubans.", "id": "cy2sg6u"}, {"comment": "Some businesses don't want everyone to be their customer.

In my life I've never seen so much talk of rape as in the last 2 years, and most of it coming from the US, and even weirder, most stories aren't about actual rape but about some implication of rape, or threat of rape or rape avoidance. \n\nRape is a real problem, of course, but is it such a big problem in the US that every day there's a story about it?

Now news headlines like that get torn apart, there's a bigger push for teaching the importance of consent and awareness, and there's a huge backlash against victim blaming. Many rapes have been going unreported, but with the changing climate being more supportive, it's becoming easier to come forward.\n\n  Because the previous culture is so ingrained, and change is uncomfortable, it's brought some friction and fear to the table. A recent case dragged a good amount of it into the open, which I think pushed a lot of minds that had been wary to be in favor of the change. \n\nSo, it's a social shift amplified by the media, I guess you could say.

South Park even has an episode about it called *Child Abduction Is Not Funny*, in response to never-ending shit shows about how your kids were going to be abducted and raped (even though they weren't). Now, try going to a park where there's a playground as a single male (bonus points if you're black or hispanic, but honestly it won't matter much).

Here in the US, we say that if you take 2 * riser height then add the tread depth the result should be between 24 and 27 (in inches, or 61 to 68.5cm) \n\nIn the case of OP's photo, the ramp in the foreground is way too steep for someone in a wheelchair to get up on their own, and looks like the limit for non-athletic people to get up with a bike or stroller.  But ignoring that, all they have to do to fix this \"what idiot did that?\" situation is to put a triangle of ramp along the left edge of the rear ramp so that you can roll \"diagonally across\" to get back onto the ramp.\n\nThis whole thing looks like someone vaguely told some fix-it guys \"we gotta have a ramp in front\" but didn't give clear directions.  The \"fix-it\" guys figured they could cobble something together (pun inended!) and did *something*, got paid and ran away.\n\nOr, you know, get someone with a brain involved, do some site measurements and drawings to develop a good solution, and rip out a fair amount of this crap and replace it with stairs, ramps and a gate that all work well together.", "id": "d7gzkjj"}, {"comment": "Looks east european...

Sin/evil is the absence of good. So basically He created a world and beings to love him. But, what is love if not a free choice? So he gave us a free choice. That free choice was to love him or not. To chose God and His love or the absence of such.\n\nInstead Adam and Eve (and importantly you or I if we were in that situation) chose to glorify themselves over God by trying to make themselves equal to Him (by eating the forbidden fruit).\n\n\nTo address your second point, it was only after Eve gave the fruit to Adam and they ate it that man began to experience these other sinful urges such as lust. They realized they were naked and clothed themselves to hide their bodies from being lusted over. They wanted to be loved properly and as a whole rather than in part--simply for their bodies.\n\nThen God punished them with death for all of mankind as well as adding pain during childbirth for women and having to work for a living for men. Previously these were not things.\n\nAll of this other sin came after mankind realized the difference between good and evil, which came after they ate of the fruit of the tree of knowledge. Before that they were ignorant of all other sin.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nSo basically God tested us with his love second, and then by our own choice we revealed to ourselves the difference between good and evil (what God wants and what God doesn't want).

Then, instead of using a domestic supplier who understands and thinks in domestic terms, they go to China via Alibaba.  For example, Jin-li: http://www.tinbox.cn/\n\nYou tell them what you want/need and send over your cover art, keylines, etc.  Some weird and furiously diligent sales person from their factory keeps harassing you wanting to know more about your market (so they can go to your customer directly) and asking for wire transfers that eat away at your cost savings.\n\nThen you get a half dozen pallets of packages with the keyline grid printed on them and a printout of the cover art on the inside of the tin.\n\n\n**Scenario 2: Your company's Nth time dealing with the supplier**\n\nThings go pretty smoothly, eventually.  If you're lucky, you'll only have one or two instances where they hold your production hostage and demand a $50k wire transfer.  You negotiate, it goes to $40k, then they ask for another one of $20k.\n\nStill, once you budget this all in, they're wonderful to work with.  The mutual exchange of ideas as you teach one another what's been figured out in your country is one of the most rewarding aspects of international trade.\n\n\n**Scenario 3: Someone leaks the end customer to the Chinese supplier**\n\nNow they have to try emulate what you told them to do for you with only teensy eensy weensy changes.  For God knows why, that means they end up going to Amazon with these ridiculous packages that are eerily close to those produced by scenario 1.\n\nI've never understood this, but my guess is that it's an artifact of patron-client government pressure.\n\n\n**Scenario 4: You learn to deal with Viet Nam instead**\n\nThey're diligent, take ownership of the project and assert their own innovations, and are fierce manufacturers.  Look at C&B or CB2 wooden furniture and you'll see what I mean.  In China, they'll weld a washer onto a bracket to make a mount for a wooden cabinet.

I call it bad because we used crappy and cheap ingredients while acting as if we grow our own produce or use buzzword meats. We would say it was meat that was organic or grassfed or free range or whatever yuppie adjectives, but it was just from Ben W Keith or Cisco or whatever like anywhere else and was just mediocre grade. We had all these gardens around the place growing produce, you know, obviously not enough to provide for everyday use at a busy restaurant, but we wouldnt use it at all! It was used just rarely enough to make the implication that we use anything we grow to not be a lie. They'd sell what was harvested in the side shop, and when stuff started going bad theyd just toss it. No employees were ever offered some veggies that were edible but ugly now, and they didnt make an effort to use then in dishes or specials. \n\nYoud think, if you had a garden literally on the premises you might use that produce to make some amazing specials with fresh ingredients grown right outside, right!? Naw, fuck that, make the special be a hamburger patty without a bun and lets cover it in old gravy!  \n\nOh man, and for a place that prides itself on waffles, the waffle iron there was so ridiculously bad! A coworker spent an entire shift trying to clean it and get it working \"properly\" and we joked about getting a pressure washer to help. Didnt end up being much cleaner but it resumed its basic functionality. Maybe they decided to replace it in the last 3 years. \n\nOh, there was also the 365 day a year BS.
