Looks like you beat me to it and kinda one-upped me but that's totally ok.\n\nWhen I was 16, I bought a leatherman wave with my very first paycheck. This tool has been through a lot. I've used it literally every day since then. I built my first computer with it. I worked a number of manual labor jobs through university with it. I've opened parcels with it. I've rewired plugs with it. I've cropped photos for photoframes with it. I've fixed three bikes with it. I've built all of my Ikea furniture with it.... no exaggeration, I've used it at least 5 times a week since I bought it. I'm now 31. \n\nA couple of weeks ago the locking mechanism on the main blade broke. I was seriously bummed out. Not crying in the shower, inconsolable but still... I did stare at the thing for 5 mins thinking back on 15 years of my life and all the random cool shit I've got up to with this in my hand.\n\nWell it turns out the whole \"lifetime warranty\" thing isn't just a marketing ploy. I filled out a form. You get to specify whether you don't mind them sending you a brand new tool or if it has sentimental value and you just want the individual parts replaced. I specified it was sentimental and since I was sending it back, I also mentioned that the scissors sometimes stick and after years of abuse, I'd chipped the smallest flat-head screwdriver head. 9 days later, a package arrived this morning. My tool came back with a brand new blade, new scissors and small screwdriver. It cost me $13 to ship it and my penknife of 15 years just came back exactly how it was but with all its worn parts renewed. Good for another decade or two. \n\nI wish I'd made an account with reddit years ago just to add credibility to this post so it doesn't seem suspiciously like a marketing bot from leatherman. I just don't understand how they make money on their tools. This is by far the best company I've ever bought from. Ironically, it's kind of a shame their tools are such good quality because I have no need to buy anything from them now. I'm almost tempted to buy another tool from them just to give my support but what would be the point - I've got my tool, and this thing is a fucking tank.

You are repeating a lie that was started by a small group of Bush supporters when he was running for his second term against John Kerry. Tim Leatherman signed a letter (along with several other prominent businessmen in the outdoor gear arena) supporting Kerry solely because of Bushes environmental record. While Leatherman didn't agree with Kerry's stances on several issues, he felt that Kerry's stance on the environment was spot on. \n  \nHere is Leatherman's response when this all started:  \n  \n\n>\u201cI have received lots of e-mails because of my endorsement of the Kerry/Edwards ticket. Some of you merely made an inquiry as to whether it was true. Some of you supported my position. Some of you opposed, but were polite, and offered well reasoned arguments as why I should not have done what I did \u2013 interesting food for thought.\n\nFar more of you stated very, very emphatically that you were no longer going to buy LEATHERMAN products and were going to tell family, friends, co-workers, and everyone else with whom you come in contact to no longer do so either. Some used unbelievably crude and vulgar language. Some made accusations, that if proven, would get me executed. At least one of you stated you hope I\u2019ll rot in the place the opposite of heaven. Most of you, merely because I publicly stated how I was going to vote, jumped to a lot of unjustified and untrue conclusions about my positions on the issues.\n\nI did endorse Kerry/Edwards. However, the endorsement was personal. No corporate money (or personal either, for that matter), was contributed to any candidate, any party, PAC, or any political entity what-so-ever. In the endorsement I did include my job title and the company I work for, and since my name and the company name are the same, many of you said the endorsement was by the company. Some of you say claiming after the fact that the endorsement was personal isn\u2019t good enough to escape your wrath. If you were one of them, I don\u2019t think anything I can say will change your mind. If you were not one of them, you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself.\n\nFor many of you, gun control was your one and only issue. Some of you saw Kerry (and still see \u2013 I am still getting e-mails written as if the election had not yet occurred) quite literally as an enemy (or worse) for one thing and only one thing \u2013 because of how you feel he feels about gun control. One person went so far as to tell me that I am his enemy because being a friend of his enemy makes me his enemy. Amazingly, all those people decided to boycott my company and called me all those names without a single one asking me my position on gun control. My position is, assuming you are a law abiding citizen and own weapons that are legal to own, that no one should be able to take your guns away from you. I own a rifle and shotgun myself.\n\nSome of you have jumped to the conclusion that I don\u2019t want hunters and fishermen (and women) to have access to public lands for hunting and fishing. That is incorrect. I too am a hunter and fisherman.\n\nSome of you have jumped to the conclusion that I am anti-military. I am not. I think some wars need to be fought. Some of you think I am anti Vietnam era veterans. I am not. I have never been in the military, but I lived in Vietnam for over two years (Aug. \u201972 \u2013 April \u201975). I am probably one of the few Americans of my generation to pay his own way to get there.\n\nJust because I said I was going to vote for Kerry didn\u2019t mean that I supported every position Kerry took. And I acknowledge, there were times when it was tough to figure out what his position was. I did (and do) believe that some of the things George W. Bush did during his first term in office were not good for the country. Overall, I felt we needed a change of leadership, but a majority of the country thought otherwise.\n\nAlmost all of you said I have a right to my opinion, but having stated my opinion, you have a right to try to punish me economically by not buying LEATHERMAN tools. I agree. You do. With your personal money. (Not government money. See below.) Some of you were concerned that by buying LEATHERMAN tools company funds would go to support political candidates in which you did not believe. I have already assured you that neither company funds nor personal funds went to any candidate, party, PAC, or other political entity. It also seems to me you are being highly selective in only going after those of us who were willing to stand up and state our opinion and not require someone from every company from which you buy anything to state a politically correct opinion or risk a boycott. Also, it seems unfair to me to penalize all the employees of a company when one of the employees states an opinion you oppose. Over 300 people work at Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. Many employees do not share my opinions. U.S. manufacturing jobs are already disappearing fast enough without taking a hit from those of you who undoubtedly consider yourselves to be patriotic Americans.\n\nMost of you are worried about encroachments on your rights. I\u2019m worried too. Some of you say you work for government agencies, and have control over purchases for your agency, and that you will no longer buy LEATHERMAN tools because of how I voted. I would think that is illegal. How would you feel if it comes to the point that individual government employees make decisions on government purchases or providing government services based on the public positions you are taking? How would you feel if a fire fighter refused to come to your home to put out a fire because he or she didn\u2019t like something you said in public?\n\nIt seems to me more reasonable to consider whether to buy a product on the merits of the product itself, not on how one of the employees of the company said he was going to vote.\n\nI have to admit I was surprised by the outpouring of response. Some of you pointed out it\u2019s Business 101 to not offend your customers. Now that I am looking back, I agree with you. I guess my problem is that I never took Business 101. I graduated in Engineering. And I never realized that merely publicly stating how I was going to vote would bring such virulent responses. I would have thought that if you didn\u2019t agree with how I was going to vote, but knowing I had already decided, you would have put your efforts into convincing the undecided to vote your way, rather than try to convince me to change my mind, but I guess you didn\u2019t see it that way.\n\nI hope I have given enough information so that those of you who still have open minds can decide how you feel about LEATHERMAN. If not, I\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you might have.\n\nTim Leatherman\nPresident, Leatherman Tool Group, Inc.", "id": "d97w6x4"}, {"comment": "Gun nuts are *nuts*.

Enjoy. \n\n*****\n\nI first met her around the time of my nineteenth birthday.\n\nShe was a present, in the same way that getting clothes for Christmas when you\u2019re eight is a \u201cpresent\u201d. I didn\u2019t have my own car, so tensions between my brother and I were running high as we fought over the use of the white one with increasing frequency and furor, and this was the solution.\n\nOf course, I got the new one, which left a bitter taste in my brother\u2019s mouth, but he didn\u2019t complain too loudly \u2013 he\u2019d already junked his up to his liking and no longer had me in his hair.\n\nI swore that I\u2019d never seen anything as gorgeous in my entire life, and she was mine if I would only finish college.\n\nCollege saw her as a part of my personality. Not many people had a \u201cmint wintergreen\u201d car, and it gave more rides to more fucked up people than most buses in poorer neighborhoods. I remember putting L in the trunk once, and exceeding the weight limit many, many times. When I left college, no one took her away, despite the fact that I didn\u2019t live up to my end of the bargain. I think dad was just happy to see me making very good money and following in his footsteps. Either that or he didn\u2019t want to feel like an Indian giver.\n\nI didn\u2019t really bond with her until after college.\n\nI spent about a week a month in that car, easily, if you count driving back and fourth across the lower half of Louisiana every other weekend like clockwork. For years, it was just me and a pack of smokes and some Gatorade and one of the four or five stereos I went thorough (as demure as she was, she always managed to catch the eye of the late night cat burglars. She just had that girl-next-door quality, I guess).\n\nI think she was in her prime during these years. The post-collage, pre-California years. Maybe it was just that we were both in our prime: young, hungry, always looking for an adventure. We were inseparable\u2026 always on the road to Lake Charles, to see about a girl. We saw and did things together that most people either don\u2019t believe, or will never get to see. Me and her have seen a truck eat an older Cadillac, sparks and engine bolts flying thirty feet into the air, glowing orange with heat. Me and her\u2019ve been part of one of the biggest police chases I\u2019d ever seen. We\u2019ve seen people die on the road. We\u2019ve seen cars on fire. We\u2019ve seen the University of Dallas\u2019 Brick Dick, Pensacola\u2019s white beaches, the piss/fuck/fight tree in Crowville, LA, and the great flood of Lake Charles. We\u2019ve been off-roading, camping, underwater, in the air, and sometimes, when we were really lucky and alive, we\u2019d be speeding the wrong way down the interstate in the middle of the night.\n\nSo many things happened because of her. I became friends with TG as we both sat inside her, driving who knows where, and I asked TG to tell me a story. Suicide was considered and re-considered by many under her roof. H and I would sneak off to park in a dark place, under a tree, where we\u2019d laugh and kiss and sixty-nine in the back seat, coming up only when we realized that we couldn\u2019t see out of any windows.\n\nShe made everything possible, like legs make walking possible.\n\nWhen I filled her with as much of my stuff as she\u2019d hold, and we drove away from the junkyard of memories that was now my ex-apartment\u2026 when I saw my friends and brothers get smaller in the rear view, waving sadly, thinking about what of what I\u2019d left they\u2019d go home with\u2026 I think she knew. I think she knew things were going to change. But, this was the biggest adventure yet, and she and I were going to make it all the way across the country, just us, so fear would have to take a back seat, but it couldn\u2019t, because my CD\u2019s and clothes and cartons of cigarettes were in the way.\n\nI swear she\u2019s never handled better than she did during those three days across the desert. She\u2019ll certainly never go faster than the 110? 120? We did down the side of that mountain.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what started the decline. Or, maybe it was the emotional abandonment. As I spent more and more time in California, I spent more and more time on the bus. She became H\u2019s car more than mine \u2013 I\u2019d sit in the driver\u2019s seat, and she and I would sit there, in the silent cold of a desert night, trying to get used to each other again. She was familiar there, but\u2026 cold. Distant.\n\nI only drove her for pleasure when it was late, and I was high. On those nights, things were like they were before. On those nights, it was just her and I and the dark, dark night and the road and the stereo and the cigarettes and we could live forever at seventy five\u2026 but only for the twenty minutes it took me to get home.\n\nThings started to get clunky, unreliable. The speedometer was the first sign; I still remember thinking that my baby was dying when I heard that high-pitched whine, and saw the needle jump up to 100 while I was only doing maybe thirty on a residential street. That only happened that one time during the trip, and I didn\u2019t see that behavior again for months\u2026 but it became a constant. I got used to it, we got used to it. We\u2019ve spent entire road trips with her speedometer telling me that we were doing about forty miles more than we really were.\n\nHer condition didn\u2019t become serious until I sent her in to get prepped for the drive back to Louisiana. I didn\u2019t know it then\u2026 I just knew I\u2019d seen the oil light come on and that\u2019d never happened before. Still, nothing was desperate. We got used to my weekly under-the-hood violations, pumping her full of fluids like a cancer patient. I think she even began to enjoy it, and maybe so did I. All this new time I was spending on her, making her better, and with the blessing of my wife, even. She knew I still loved her, and she was happier. She must have been thrilled when I practiced new ways of driving her, so that I could learn to deal with her clutch pedal problem.\n\nI wonder how utterly destroyed she was when she saw the new girl. The hip girl. The roomy girl. The more powerful girl. The one that everyone ooh\u2019ed and aah\u2019ed over, and climbed into and drove off with, leaving her in the parking lot. The one who not only COULD pass the state emissions test, but didn\u2019t even have to try for at least two years yet.\n\nI wonder how much it hurt, to sit there in the parking lot, unused, for weeks, wondering what that failure on that test meant for her future.\n\nI swear I could feel her stare at me when I walked past her in the mornings for my run.\n\nWe talked. On that last day.\n\n\u201cSo nice of you to drop by,\u201d she said, sourly. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to Lake Charles,\u201d I said. \u201cJust you and I.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. I started her engine.\n\nI said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see about a girl,\u201d and I patted her gently on the dash.\n\n\u201cJust you and I?\u201d she said. I nodded. I think she understood. I think \u2013 I hope \u2013 she\u2019s always liked it there.\n\nI was wrong, before. I was wrong. Yesterday. She has never, ever handled better than she did yesterday, on the way to Lake Charles, to see about a girl.\n\nA nineteen year old. Who had just celebrated her birthday. And who didn\u2019t have a car of her own. I envy her. That broken-down old Tercel is the best car anyone could ever wish for.\n\nIts the best goddamn car in the whole fucking world.\n\nI took all my junk, two screws, and the dented Lakeside Toyota license plate frame off of her. I\u2019m going to fasten my new plate on my new car inside of that frame, and with those two screws. That way, maybe when I ride, her soul will ride with me.\n\nGood luck, old girl. Take care of AM, and let her take care of you. And, for what its worth\u2026 thanks.\n\n*****\n\n...would you believe I still have that license plate on my current car, affixed with those same two screws?

These companies have been taken over and/or bought out by people/boards of directors that aren't firearms enthusiast. To them, it's just another product they sell.\n\nTake Freedom Group for example - every single gun company, after they get bought by this conglomerate, we start to see quality and QC problems almost immediately. It's like they're trying to emulate the General Motors problem of a race to the bottom between cost and quality. See this quick excerpt from [this site](http://www.boblutzsez.com/New_Images___Text_Layout_5.html) about a book discussing Bob Lutz and GM:\n\n>But then GM\u2019s leadersehip began to put their faith in numbers and spreadsheets. Determined to eliminate the \u201cwaste\u201d and \u201cpersonality worship\u201d of the bygone creative leaders and maximize profitability, management got too smart for its own good. With the bean counters firmly in charge, carmakers, and much of American industry, lost their single-minded focus on product excellence and their competitive advantage. Decline soon followed.\n \n>In 2001, General Motors hired Lutz out of retirement with a mandate to save the company by making great cars again. As Vice Chairman, he launched a war against the penny-pinching number-crunchers who ran the company by the bottom line, and reinstated a focus on creativity, design, and cars and trucks that would satisfy GM customers.\n\nWe have a guy that's worked at our gun shop for over 40 years. He's a gunsmith by trade, but deals with all our backend details at the shop. His absolute favorite word is \"quality\", and he'll get up on a soapbox (literally) in the middle of the store in front of customers and talk about how a lot of the new guns now are pieces of shit.\n\nRuger, Smith & Wesson, etc - they've all had to lessen their costs because of companies like Freedom Group.

High end scopes can withstand immense punishment though without their sightings being thrown off (Nightforce scopes are particularly famous for this)\n\n* ammunition: using the same manufacturer of ammunition can improve consistency of accuracy. Variables like bullet, gun powder, and cartridge can change the way a firearm shoots. Hand loads for this reason are the most consistent for accuracy because you can control every step of making the round after buying components.\n\n* Bore; Rifling within the barrel can wear out over time and thus reduce the accuracy of the shot. Rifling is twisted grooves within the barrel that imparts spin to the bullet. Some firearms do not have rifling (most notably, shotguns). Additionally, barrel length will affect accuracy and range due to differences in speed of the bullet (shorter barrel means less energy imparted to the bullet by the expanding gas). \n\n* Action type; bolt actions are typically the most accurate action type in firearms. Them have few moving parts and the tolerances of the parts can be very tight; this means that less outside influence can affect the shot. Semi automatics rely on systems to cycle the next round and eject the empty cartridge--there's a lot of moving parts and things aren't as tight because of this (have to be able to slide past each other).\n\nThese are the most obvious variables affecting accuracy in firearms, at least the ones that I can recall off the top of my head.

I don't know about that gun's full history, but I do know that many thousands of rounds went through the other over the years (easily 10K just from me, as we bought ammunition in multiple bricks in the 1980s and shot all the time) and it's still one of the most accurate open-sighted guns I've ever fired.", "id": "d949oux"}, {"comment": "Your Browning is a slightly improved version of my Challenger, bought in 1965 and used in college competition. 10k rounds per year for two years, probably half that since then.  You will *not* wear it out.  As far as accuracy goes, with any ammunition my Challenger will group better than I can hold it. It's one of two guns that have never lied to me.\n\nOne of our college team's Hi-Standards was bought in 1955 and used by members of the team until I got there. It was putting bullets sideways at 60'. The armourers wouldn't condemn it without checking it out. They recrowned the barrel and sent it back, giving us shit for 'beating it up with a ballpein hammer'. ( I swear we didn't ). Put it in the machine rest and it shot as well as any of the others. That thing must have had 100k rounds through it, because in the late '50s we were told they had four pistols for a team of six or eight.\nDoes anybody know if these things are still in use at rmc?\n\nEdit. Get some spare mags for your Browning. I only have one for mine, they are made of unobtainium now, and if this one wears out, or one of the kids bumps the mag in too hard ( fuckin' video games ) and bends the lips, the Browning becomes a pretty lump. \n\n", "id": "d954fjt"}, {"comment": "> Get some spare mags for your Browning.\n\nYikes!

TV sets and refrigerators started appearing on the market in the late 70s~early 80s and only the rich could afford them back then. ", "id": "cybilx9"}, {"comment": "Well, I'm not sure what you know about metals, so I'll start pretty basic. It's rare to find pure metals in production. Generally, no one metal has all the properties you desire (durability, weight, thermal properties, etc.). So you mix a couple of types to create an alloy. Common alloys are things like steel and brass. Pewter is less common example. Basically, if there's a metal that isn't on the periodic table, it's most likely a combination of two or more metals that are on there. \n\nBut when mixing metals, you run into the purity issue again. Metal comes from the ground. The ground is dirty. That dirt is made up of certain elements from the periodic table that can end up in the metal, even after mining and processing. So you're not really working with 100% iron in your steel.\n\nYou can get the impurities out using heat, since different elements have different melting points, and densities change at different temperatures. But you just can't have 100% pure metal in the real world. And the purer you want it, the more it'll have to be processed. And that costs money. \n\nSo to answer your question, if a company cuts costs by using a lower quality metal, those impurities will manifest themselves in more drastic ways. Your bowls could fracture. Your toaster could heat up incorrectly and start a fire. Your hand mixer could leech heavy metals into your mashed potatoes (I wish that was as cool as it sounds.). ", "id": "cybmqpq"}, {"comment": ">  Volume for volume, wouldn't any metal, even the shittiest one, be better than any plastic,\n\nNo. But plastics/polymers of that high of quality or engineering are a relatively new thing. \n\n>How shitty can steel be?\n\nHow fast can a [Liberty Ship sink?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_ship#Hull_cracks). [Molded pot metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_metal) tends to facture easy, cheap items made of it can easily split apart at the joints.  \n\nYou did touch on the main points though. Almost no one is going to buy $400 heavy duty toaster. The $15 piece of crap half plastic thing will last most people for a while and buy another one when it breaks is pretty easy. Also consumers have mixed feelings about appliance that are as heavy as the used to be in the past. In the past people used to repair appliances, but these days the labor costs are high enough in relation to the price of the original item that replacement is normally what occurs. \n\n*adding this.\n\nModern steel and metals are so 'good' because of the science of production conformity. Older items typically had issues that could not be seen easily at the time. Such as defects in the metal that could lead to stress failure.

Many Swiss, German, vintage American watches, etc. as well. ", "id": "d55j4e2"}, {"comment": "> If you care enough to make your own movement instead of a mass produced off the shelf one, it usually leads to a better made watch overall.\n\nI *strongly* disagree.  I've been collecting watches since I was nine years old.  I'm 43 today.\n\nThere is a lot of hoopla around in-house movements today.  The truth is that it is mostly hype and marketing.  Start producing your own movements and you can raise the price.  Further, it means that all service has to be done at the mothership meaning service will cost two or three times what it would cost at an independent watchmaker.  Moreover, the companies won't sell repair parts to independents.\n\nBut what *really* makes in-house movements a bad deal is that they're usually copies of ETA movements!  For those not in the hobby, a company called Eterna developed a fantastic automatic movement in 1948.  It was so good that Eterna started a side business called ETA to make watch movements for other brands.  ETA is huge today and many automatic watches use ETA movements.\n\nLet's demolish a couple of myths:\n\n1. ETA movements are some of the most finely made and robust watch movements on the market.  They are flat-out excellent.  People are mostly pissy about exclusivity, NOT quality.  \"But an ETA movement is so common it can't be good!\"  Yeah, in the same way a Chevy 350 is a steaming pile of garbage.  (It isn't by the way.)  A Chevy 350 is so darned good that you can buy them and parts for them freakin' everywhere.  Same thing with a watch movement like an ETA 2824.  A 2824 is wonderful.  That's why they're everywhere.\n\n2. The snooty in-house movement you're paying an extra $2,000 for is most likely a clone of the ETA 2824.  It has been changed just enough so not to be compatible with 2824 parts, but it's still basically the same thing.  So you get your \"exclusivity\" with a movement that is pretty much the same as the movement that isn't exclusive enough for you.  Except it costs a hell of a lot more and three times as much to service.\n\nAnd one more thing.  The watch industry has been overproducing for several years and prices are crazy.  There are too many companies in the market.  Next time the financial markets hit a bump, a bunch of those companies are going to die.  If you have a watch with an in-house movement, kiss your money goodbye.  Parts for your movement will never, ever become available again.  Your watch will probably lose 90% or more of its value.\n\nIf you want a nice automatic watch, buy one with an ETA movement.  ETA makes a high quality movement and there will *always* be ETA parts available.  It really is the Chevy 350 of the watch world.  If you need something more expensive, buy a Rolex.  Rolex is huge and has so many watches out there that there will always be Rolex service and repair.  Rolex is a safe buy and they make an excellent watch.", "id": "d55qhvs"}, {"comment": "I'm with you on the consensus that \"in house must be better\" is largely bollocks. However, the Seiko movements work because they are designed with robustness in mind, not just prestige, and are ubiquitous enough that they don't suffer from the parts/service exclusivity issue.

They are all hand made and I just adore them.\n\nHowever, I am one of those people who don't tend to lose items, so I think many people would be turned off by spending $10 on a basic comb.

I'm looking for one for my son, who has short, fine, thick hair.", "id": "d55iulr"}, {"comment": "I personally feel the #9 is a pretty good basic comb for most people and their site suggests it's good for long hair.  Taking a look at the models that say \"Great for thick hair\" would probably be best. \n\n[#9 Link](https://www.speert.com/closeup.cfm?item=9&cfpage=combs-products.cfm&startrow=1&Category=Combs&SubCategory=Handmade%20Combs&readingpower=&sort=70&keywords=)\n\nAdditionally when picking a comb you probably want to consider hair texture and how you style.  I tend to not be a big fan of the combs with two different size teeth, I like mine to be equal all the way through as I pull it through my hair.  If the teeth are too far apart I will have time detailing (such as parting my hair) but if the teeth are too tight I am going to have to work hard to detangle my hair.\n\nThe #9 in my opinion is great for most hair and can be used to detangle, part and work through most knots without much trouble.  It is easy to clean and very durable, just like their other models (though I would not recommend the wood ones).\n\nThe #18 is a slightly larger version of the #9 with more room between the teeth (so probably good for thick curly hair).\n\nThe #19 is equivalent to the #18, but has a handle as some people may prefer that.  If their hair is long (longer than the collar) then this would be a little more time and energy efficent.  If their hair is fine the handle won't really add much.\n\nIf you have a serious fro of tight curls the #2 is your best bet.\n\nBy the looks of it the #10, #22, and #60 could probably be used for backcombing.\n\nMost models also have a version with a cover for travel (or whatever).  There are also eyebrow/mustach/beard combs for people who like having a range of items.\n\nTLDR: I realize I think too much about hair combs.  Unless your hair can double as an airbag, go with the #9.\n\n", "id": "d55jsve"}, {"comment": "Oster for hair clippers.", "id": "d55j29k"}, {"comment": "Kent also make fantastic brushes and combs.

If it was well-designed back then and still works, it's probably as good as anything today.\n\nI very much disagree when it comes to speakers.\n\nAround the year 2000, it became possible to computer model speakers.  Have you ever seen how much work goes into getting the drivers, cabinet and crossover to match up?  It used to take months, even for the most talented designers.  Endless prototypes and computer simulations just weren't good enough.\n\nBut when computers became powerful enough to model, everything changed.  What took six months could now be done in hours.  Yes, it made a huge difference for speakers.\n\nFurther, driver designs were modeled and improved.  This is why you see so many more two way speakers than three way, since drivers have wider ranges.\n\nSince around 2000, we have much better materials science.  Drivers are made from better materials (and much, much, much stronger magnets) making them more linear and extending the range.\n\nComputers have also given us interesting active crossovers.  Look at speaker designs like the Linkwitz LX521.4 and the NaO Note II RS.  They have computers as crossovers.  Again, this would not have been possible before 2000 or so.\n\nFinally, hobbyist speaker designers are using computer modeling to design DIY speakers.  DIY is spooky good these days.  If you want to build your own speakers, a number of designs will deliver world-class performance on the cheap.  It's like having Ferrari performance for the cost of a used Accord.\n\nAll of this also goes for headphones.  Some of the new models are truly exceptional.\n\nAlso, I **do** agree with you about amplifiers, preamps, turntables, etc.  You are completely right about those, they have changed very little.\n", "id": "czfetlr"}, {"comment": "Where do I find these miracles of modern audio design from between the crap?

They are made with various treated leathers (of course), cork, the sole material, and a bit of metal (for shaping and eyelets).\n\nStarting with the leather.  Leather a dead natural material.  It's subject to bacterial attack and elements just like your skin.  While living tissue has a way to protect and regulate itself, leather does not.  Letting any leather shoe dry out (usually over 24 hours) is important for letting the leather sort of self-repair a bit from the germs and humidity of your feet.  Oh yeah, humidity.  Ever see your skin prune?  Leather does that to an extent.  Take a leather wallet and leave it in the sink for an hour and see what happens.   It won't be great when you want to next use it.  \n\nCork!  Cork is finicky with liquids.  Which is why we use it in bottles.  But you don't want your shoe cork to expand and contract or anything, it's there to mold under the foot.  It will be damaged if it becomes too moist, which can happen if you pack in the shoe with your sweaty toes every day.  \n\nThat's why.  Give leather shoes 24 hours to recover after the day.  Whether or not their are great leather and have cork or whatever, they will survive better. It also helps (because you are airing them out) with smells caused by sweat + bacteria + leather.  Wet leather also smells sometimes.  Your feet just create too efficient of a humid barrier between the air and the inside of the shoe to allow it to recover..\n\n\n I've also noticed that women don't mind a guy who doesn't wear the same shoes every day.", "id": "d9kl9jk"}, {"comment": "If you do wear them everyday, which you shouldnt, put shoe trees in them and make them breathe every night", "id": "d9gvuva"}, {"comment": "\"Make them breathe every night\" Does that mean take the shoe trees out or something?

The UI was popular enough, that MS actually took a page from Apple, and turned their media player OS into a phone OS. Much in the way the iPod interface matured into iOS, the Zune UI morphed into Windows Phone 7.

Even going so far as to use the Zune software for the phones backup and sync functionality, just like the iPhone relies on iTunes.\n\nOnly after the popularity and awards for the WP7 UI, did MS decide to roll out the same \"Metro\" style interface into Win8, and XBox 360, and obviously WP8 itself.\n\nEDIT: LOL, downvotes for factual, verifiable information.

No you are buying a set of wrenches. \n\nThe question isnt if China *can* produce quality, is is if that is the primary focus. The question is if quality is their most common production. And the answer is no. As you said you get what you pay for and China more often than not you are paying less for cheap junk. You say if you purchased a cheap German bearing it round perform identically, except there aren't many German companies that produce a dirt cheap option. Their focus is on quality and is priced as such. \n\nIt boils down to this. A majority of Chinese products are focused on price, and the quality reflects that. Companies don't move production there for quality they move it there because it us cheap. I have snapped multiple wrenches that where of foreign production the exact same set from the exact company  for slightly more made in the USA and not a single issue. I have heard the same from multiple coworkers. Exact same set, exact same company, similar price, same aged tools, different quality.\n\nThe best chainsaws? Sweden and Germany. There isn't a Chinese made saw at all that comes even close. *Could* China made an equal? Sure, but they don't. \n\nSo it is not that China CANT make quality items, the obviously can. The point is that 70% of the time it will be cheap lesser quality while the German production 70% of the time will be more expensive and high quality. \n\nThat is why I said it isn't perfect but it's a darn good start.

Speaking as someone with a lot of experience in manufacturing and process automation I can tell you that it is never smooth moving a product line.  \n\nIt takes time to establish a functioning process to quickly produce good parts.  When you up and move it to a new location, often with new equipment you have to start over.  You lose talent, from engineering guys who designed the equipment all the way down to the barely functioning alcoholic machine operator who has a widget he made out of a length of pipe that is bent just right to get past the guards and pop a stuck part loose rather than pulling down the safeties and stopping the line for 5 minutes.\n\nYou wind up with a drop in production(with no drop in demand) and a whole lot of bad parts.

More than anything, what costs money in manufacturing is tight tolerances... \n\nSo if your product is properly engineered in the first place, nearly any deviation from print will cause problems.  Those problems range from a loose joint that is a little tight to a perfectly functioning part that will wear out years to early.\n\nWhen you move manufacturing locations even within country this sort of thing is nearly inevitable.  It can be avoided by keeping the original factory running while the new one spins up... But that defeats the whole cost saving goal.

There's really 3 main things that cause most electronics to fail: heat, batteries, and moving parts. Heat is mostly an issue for PCs, game consoles, smartphones, anything with a powerful CPU, but it will rarely be the first thing to fail unless the device is particularly poorly-engineered (Red Ring of Death). Modern electronics all use Lithium batteries, which have a limited life-span and are almost never replaceable, and older electronics are vulnerable to corrosion from leaky batteries. Moving parts is probably the most common cause of failure: fans, disk drives, hard drives, etc. are usually the first thing to fail in most devices. \n\nBut there are definitely some computerized items that are fairly BIFL.

It's less wasteful to the environment to only buy one, than to buy 20.\n\n2. Even at the beginning of a cheaper bag's durability cycle, it may not be as nice, in terms of aesthetics, comfort, size, or some other attribute, as a more expensive bag.

There may be something psychologically rewarding to have a bag that's lasted since you bought it, since you can associate memories or times with that specific object, rather than it being just another temporary thing you have at that current moment.\n\nAll this is not to say that I would necessarily (really, *ever*...) recommend a $600 messenger bag.

The battery has long since been dead by overuse and poor standards, it's been dropped a plethora of times and many plastic and other components have fallen off or do not work.

The new version is not only shoddier made (clearly cheaper parts that don't fit together well etc.) but also, where the old one disassembled fairly easily to clean out the crap that builds up inside the heads, the new one is essentially completely sealed off, so when the heads clog (less than a year with my previous model thanks to my cat's insane amount of hair and vomit) I'll have no choice but to spend $50 on new ones. On top of this there's an amusing warning box in the instruction manual that informs you that \"other cleaning solutions\" than Bissell's own brand may harm the machine and will void the warranty. Way to \"Apple-ify\", Bissell.\n\nOf course companies only build what the public buys, so the only real way to combat this trend is to 'vote with our wallets'. If consumers were more choosy about design ethics and only purchased models with repairable features and avoided proprietary \"enforcements\", the companies pulling such crap would go out of business.

What if it were an IC instead that had blown ? And they wouldn't sell you an IC ? Or even a schematic ?\n\nOften enough it wouldn't matter whether you had the schematics.\n\nI'm into DIY electronics and love to solder.  There are still two major problems.  One, many electronics have moved to SMD.  SMD makes for easy assembly - you can have a robot place components on a PCB and then the PCB goes into an oven to bake the components on.\n\nThis is *hugely* more efficient than having a human place components on a through-hole PCB and then solder them.  And that's a lot more efficient than the old-school assembly methods like point-to-point soldering, wire wrapping, and a few other methods.\n\nThe problem with SMD is when it comes to repair.  The parts are *tiny* and it is difficult to remove them without damaging surrounding parts.  Simply trying to heat up the bad part can heat up surrounding parts, causing them to slide around.  It's an immense pain in the balls and part of the reason replacing is easier than repair.  Personally, I work on old radios and hi-fi gear.  I build everything point-to-point with terminal lugs.  Yes, this involves a lot more labor.  However, replacing something like a bad capacitor is an absolute breeze.  There is no PCB to desolder and remove from the case.  You snip the bad capacitor off its two lugs, desolder the old solder and any remnants of the leads.  Then you solder in the new capacitor.  It takes two or three minutes because that is how you design for a repair.  Doing the same with SMD components can take a few hours and there's a *much* greater chance you'll fuck it up and possibly ruin it permanently if other components slide around.\n\nThe other huge problem is with ICs and transistors.  When they go out of production, that is the end.  IP laws make it impossible to reproduce old transistors any time soon.  Further, there's not much of a market in reproducing old chips.  Moreover, today's just-in-time accounting is *extremely* lean and guarantees that there will be few, if any, spare transistors.  When they're gone, they're gone forever.  A little story: I was going to build an audio project that was published in 2006.  It used a particular transistor that there is no substitute for.  It went out of production around 2009.  I looked and looked and looked, and that transistor is not available anywhere at any price.  Totally, completely, absolutely gone.  Now, I have an old Atwater-Kent neutrodyne radio.  It was manufactured in 1926.  I can still buy vacuum tubes for it.  Actually, quite a few vacuum tubes are being remanufactured today.  The IP is long expired and tubes are widely used by guitarists and audio enthusiasts, so getting tubes is no problem.  \n\nI can buy vacuum tubes for a 90 year-old radio, but I can't buy transistors for a 10 year-old audio project.  Go figure.\n\nSo even if you had the schematic and were skilled at working on SMD boards, you might not be able to get the transistors you need.  Nobody would be able to get the transistors you need.\n\nHere's my take on modern electronics.  I own and use computerized things, like my desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, router, etc.  All those things are *disposable,* meaning I write them off as a complete loss if they stop working.  I replace them when they die.  That's just how it is.\n\nWhen it comes to appliances, I **never** buy anything with a computerized board.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Only analog.\n\nI'm into audio and build my own gear, so it is all point-to-point tubed gear.  Repairs take minutes.\n\nI will own a car with through-hole PCBs, since those are somewhat repairable.  Though my second car was built in November 1970 and has computerized nothing.  It is easy to troubleshoot and repair, though it rarely needs anything.\n\nI strongly recommend avoiding computerized products.  Buy analog appliances and older, fully depreciated cars that have a minimum of computerization.  Cars from the 1990s are often strong performers and easy to repair compared to today's computerized cars.\n\nFinally, sorry if I sound like a Luddite.  I love computers and have been using them since 1979.  I love my computer, I love my smartphone, I love the Internet.  But I don't want computerization in my oven or washing machine.  That stuff breaks and can be expensive, difficult or sometimes impossible to repair.  I am not going to waste money on that.

It is very easy to replace power cords and headwires.  They do need to be oiled, but that's only once every 8-12 weeks.

My father did home inspections and would have this long talk he would give about water heaters and how they worked. Basically they started out as glass, but because they would frequently break when they were installed they replaced the glass with steel. However under these conditions it's not a matter of if it will rust, but how long will it take. To extend the life of the tanks they added anode rods. The air in the water would rust the rod and not the steel container. The real difference between a water heater with a 5 year warranty and 10 year warranty is the size of the anode rod and how much water they expect to run through it on a daily basis. Use the same water heater more then they estimated and it's life will be cut shorter then expected, use it less and it's extended. Once the rod is gone the tank starts to rust. Eventually, no mater how well you care for it, it WILL break. I don't think there is any such thing as a BIFL water heater on the market.\n\nWhat about extending the life of one? You can replace the rods and under use the water heater right? Well yes but the problem is you want to replace it BEFORE it breaks, not after.

Even prior to that time air, which you did correctly state, has been, and still is, the preferred method for water removal, because it is completely touch less, removing all chance of imparting any swirl marks to the paint at all.\n\nThere is a multitude of evidence out there to support what I, and several others in this thread, had said regarding chamois and blades. Companies don't care what their product does or doesn't do, so long as they can sell that product to the target audience. Look at any consumer automotive detail product isle, and you can see that plain as day. With a multitude of dressings and waxes thst are more marketing than substance. Like Armor All, which can dry out the dash, and turn your tires brown, but most people swear by it. You sell to the customers expectations (oh, it makes my dash shiney, it must be good!), not always the products abilities, and certainly never it's weaknesses, stating that long term use could be detrimental to your cars health.\n\nA majority of my details, especially high end details, are direct from dealer paint corrections. Because even high end dealers are as clueless as the day is long on proper automotive paint maintenance. Within the detail industry we even call it \"Dealer Installed Swirl Marks\" because it is such a common occurrence. What any dealer wants is what is quick, not what is right. Even if it is a $150k car, they are just like any other dealership. Just because they sell it, doesn't make them an expert on it. And I can guarantee you, that if I went down to any one of those dealerships, brought along a test panel, a polisher, and an inspection light...I would have them buying microfiber towels in bulk, in less than an hour. We will polish the hood, do an inspection, then wash each side using our respective washing and drying apparatus, then hit it with a full spectrum inspection light again to see which one has fewer spiderwebs on it. When they see the microfiber side is completely blemish free, and their side is not, they will get on board. Considering this is a regular test I do when consulting with dealerships that offer detail services, as a means to improve the quality of their product, and draw in more detail service customers, I am plenty qualified, and there is plenty of quantifiable evidence to show that microfiber is the preferred  material for drying your vehicle. And in the long run, it is considerably cheaper, as the service life of a microfiber is better than a chamois, and requires less training to minimize potential paint damage.

It's much much cheaper to fix a problem on the production line than it is out in the field. One way Toyota handled their Quality Control better than their competitors was by giving each worker the power to stop the production line. So if Mr Electric Window Switch Installer found that his switches weren't fitting into their position properly he could stop the production line. A solution would then be found before the production line restarted. \n\nThe philosophy is that although it costs a lot of money to stop the production line, it costs even more to find 10, 20, 100 thousand cars around the world to fix each of their electric window switches.\n\nNote that this is just one example of waste minimisation / elimination and by multiplying these small actions across the entire company huge savings can be found.", "id": "da4qlc0"}, {"comment": "Beautiful explanation of this.", "id": "da4t1jr"}, {"comment": "And he does good making a point this is one of many examples of applying the methodology.

I tore holes in them all over the lower legs and probably had 15 patches down there. (Tele skiing is rough).  I left a candy bar in the cargo pocket, and my dog chewed through the OPEN pocket to eat the candy bar. I washed them in the wash and reapplied waterproofing so many times it doesn't even make sense anymore.  Finally, after 3 years of constant abuse, bordering on misuse, the zipper broke.

It was busted.\n\nWhen I took it back to patagonia they saw all the weird glue from tele-skiing on these pants.  They asked me to wash the pants before I brought them in.  I had already done that.  I brought them home and washed them twice....no dice, this glue was permanent.  I went back to find the same employee there.  She listened to my story after reminding me to wash the pants.

These can, and do.   \n\nThey've hooked them up to machines that cut carboard continously for thousands of times, and the edge was still perfect.

That means don't use to pry something open, to turn a screw, etc. When you use the blade to apply force, always apply it in line with the blade\u2014i.e., in a cutting or slicing motion.\n\nAlso, this type of steel is prone to rust, so keep it dry and clean after use, oil it occasionally to make it moisture-resistant, and remove any rust that does appear. It needs to be sharpened more often as well (though, fortunately, the steel is quick and easy to sharpen). And be aware that using in on rock/metal or rock/metal-containing substances (including soil, or anything that has soil on it) will dull it quickly. High-carbon steel has to be babied a bit, but it gives a superior edge ideal for chef knives, carving knives, dressmaking shears, etc.\n\nIf you want a knife you can throw anything at, standard stainless steel is a better bet. The microstructure of lower-carbon steel is pretty flexible, which means it won't cut as nicely and won't be as easy to get to a razor-sharp edge, but it also won't break without quite a bit of effort. The chromium in stainless steel greatly reduces the likelihood of rust, too (though I still wouldn't let it stay wet for long periods of time). It's a royal pain to sharpen, but it maintains its edge well (since the edge will tend to bend out of the way rather than break and dull). I prefer stainless steel for more general tasks\u2014table knives, utility knives, general-purpose scissors, etc.\n\nI'm not sure if [this](https://www.leatherman.com/skeletool-cx-19.html) is your knife, but it describes its steel as a \"high-carbon stainless steel\".

All the dollar-store tools had to move to China to compete.\n\nTake a look at stuff from Huawei, Fenix, TSMC, Lenovo, Apple, or similar companies sometime. All their stuff is made in China, but it is made pretty well! Why? Because those companies didn't go there and half-ass their implementation, they spent the time and money to build a quality supply chain.\n\nEDIT: There is some valid criticism of my examples of well-made Chinese products.

We've been focusing on many American's perspective on the use of hardware tools made from China, saying that they've been making crap products compared to products from other countries like the ones you mentioned. However, China with a population of ~1.4 billion people must be using quality tools made from somewhere. How else could they have expanded so many cities, created so many new prominent sky rises that are now pinpoints of every tourist list?\n\nWHERE does China get their tools from?\n\nChina.\n\nThey even make their own cars, but have you ever heard or seen any of them making their way to western countries like the States, or any in Europe? I didn't think so. That's because China is still a pretty big elitist when it comes to exporting products. They are more into making a product while still striving to be number one! \n\nIt doesn't help that big companies that work with their production units really don't give a shit about quality most of the time as long as they made a higher profit with production companies closer to home. \"Think of the pollution that is hurting our children, honey,\" says the CEO. \"Think of all that waste that factories would be spilling into the environment that we have to take care of. Now wouldn't it be better letting someone else, somewhere else handle all these problems?\"\n\nNow, China is almost infamous for its pollution problems.\n\nSo, I guess my bottom line is, yes! Many items made in China will be of lower quality. However, there are some stuff that is made of the same old quality like it has always been and there are products of which it really doesn't even matter whether or not the quality is high or not because they're one time use products anyways.\n\nJust do your research, and if say Japan and Germany does make a far superior product- I still find it very distasteful to bash on another country that's making the same item. It's like having three kids. One is scouted by someone with a billion dollars to make a billion yarn scarves because he made a few one day and it turned out to be cheap enough to make and profitable enough to sell. The kid's like alright. I didn't think too much about it, but this sounds like an awesome idea. The second kid has always made scarves from cotton that he brings home from his days volunteering at a cotton factory to learn the tools of the trade of production because he wants to be a manager or something (I don't know!) The third kid only makes scarves from cashmere, but only because he has sensitive skin and early budding arthritis (again, just bear with it.)\n\nObviously the first two kids make superior products, but are you going to be like \"HA! That first kid sucks. He only makes shit products. This is made out of yarn. It falls apart like all the time. No wonder it was only one dollar.\" That kid is going to feel like shit. Even I feel like shit thinking of the kid feeling like shit, and the kid isn't even real. \n\nEh. Regardless of that very terrible analogy, China doesn't care about what people say for the most part.

However, I have heard that America has passed over the Steel industry to China.\n\nLet's think about this. We've been focusing on many American's perspective on the use of hardware tools made from China, saying that they've been making crap products compared to products from other countries like the ones you mentioned. However, China with a population of ~1.4 billion people must be using quality tools made from somewhere. How else could they have expanded so many cities, created so many new prominent sky rises that are now pinpoints of every tourist list?\n\nWHERE does China get their tools from?\n\nChina.\n\nThey even make their own cars, but have you ever heard or seen any of them making their way to western countries like the States, or any in Europe? I didn't think so. That's because China is still a pretty big elitist when it comes to exporting products. They are more into making a product while still striving to be number one! \n\nIt doesn't help that big companies that work with their production units really don't give a shit about quality most of the time as long as they made a higher profit with production companies closer to home. \"Think of the pollution that is hurting our children, honey,\" says the CEO. \"Think of all that waste that factories would be spilling into the environment that we have to take care of. Now wouldn't it be better letting someone else, somewhere else handle all these problems?\"\n\nNow, China is almost infamous for its pollution problems.\n\nSo, I guess my bottom line is, yes! Many items made in China will be of lower quality. However, there are some stuff that is made of the same old quality like it has always been and there are products of which it really doesn't even matter whether or not the quality is high or not because they're one time use products anyways.\n\nJust do your research, and if say Japan and Germany does make a far superior product- I still find it very distasteful to bash on another country that's making the same item. It's like having three kids. One is scouted by someone with a billion dollars to make a billion yarn scarves because he made a few one day and it turned out to be cheap enough to make and profitable enough to sell. The kid's like alright. I didn't think too much about it, but this sounds like an awesome idea. The second kid has always made scarves from cotton that he brings home from his days volunteering at a cotton factory to learn the tools of the trade of production because he wants to be a manager or something (I don't know!) The third kid only makes scarves from cashmere, but only because he has sensitive skin and early budding arthritis (again, just bear with it.)\n\nObviously the first two kids make superior products, but are you going to be like \"HA! That first kid sucks. He only makes shit products. This is made out of yarn. It falls apart like all the time. No wonder it was only one dollar.\" That kid is going to feel like shit. Even I feel like shit thinking of the kid feeling like shit, and the kid isn't even real. \n\nEh. Regardless of that very terrible analogy, China doesn't care about what people say for the most part.

It's pretty clear that high efficiency machines are true to their name, and not snake oil.\n\nThey have downsides of course, such as longer cycle times and perhaps lower reliability due to the additional complexity of the machines.

I can make a washer that only uses 1 watt of electricity and one cup of water per wash, which would be very water and energy efficient. Doesn't mean it's going to wash your clothes.\n\nHowever, in terms of electricity cost, I can prove that at least one particular top loader by Speed Queen is as energy efficient as a front loader.\n\nCompare [this Speed Queen](https://youtu.be/N4dIANgB9BM?t=11m51s) to [this Kenmore](http://www.sears.com/kenmore-elite-5.2-cu-ft-front-load-washer/p-02641072000P?prdNo=5&blockNo=5&blockType=G5). The top loading Speed Queen has an energy guide rating of 112 kWh and the front loading Kenmore has an energy guide rating of 120 kWh, slightly more, actually. Also, a bit of a disclaimer, I just picked the first front loader I found on Sears, so I don't know if the average for front loaders is lower. Even if it was any lower, it'd be a difference of 2-3 dollars, nothing statically significant. \n\nWhen it comes to water use, however, the top loader most definitely does use more, but I think the extra water cost is worth not only for the fact it will likely wash you're clothes better, but top loading Speed Queens have crazy good warranties. The Kenmore (if i read correctly) had a 1 year warranty. The Speed Queen  in the video I linked, if I remember right, has a 5 year warranty on the electronics, something about 10 years on the motor, and 20 years on everything else. No bullshit \"10 year warranty!!\" on the motor and 90 days on the electronic controls. Speed Queen makes good products and stands behind them as well.\n\nEDIT: Watched the video, the warranty on that Speed Queen was 5 years on the electronics, 15 years on the transmission, and the tubs have a lifetime warranty.

The clothes come out very, very dry. I am sure the newer washers might ring out a bit more water, but my dryer load times are under an hour, so I don't see newer dryers working much quicker. \n\nFor someone who uses hot water, runs dozens of loads, has high water bills, then perhaps yes, a new set might pay for itself.

I also use cold water only, so there is no heating water energy.\nI pay 10c per kwhr and $1 a month per 1,000 gallons of water:\n\n**Washer** -  Each load uses around 1000 watts = $0.10 per loadx12 loads = $1.20 a month for electricity\n\nEach load probably uses 100 gallons of cold water = $0.10 per loadx12 loads = $1.20 a month for water\n\n\n**DRYER** -  Dryer averages 4500 watts. A load takes around 1 hour to dry = $.45 per loadx12 loads = $5.40 a month for electricity\n\n\nTotal annual cost to run washer and dryer, for both water and electricity is $93.60 - lets be generous and round it up to an even $100 a year.

Soda lime glass is tempered though, introducing the permanent internal stresses you are probably thinking of. These stresses give it better strength than plain glass, but also mean it will tend to fail by breaking into lots of small pieces instead of large dangerous shards. \n\nFurther stresses are introduced when glass has expanded in the heat and part of it is rapidly cooled, contracting that part as a result. The defining property of borosilicate glass is that it expands and contracts very little due to heating, so it can take huge temperature differentials without undergoing significant stress. Soda lime does not share this property, and consequently much more stress is introduced into the soda lime glass by the temperature gradients we're talking about. This stress causes a crack to occur, and then the tempered glass acts as intended by propagating that crack to shatter the item into lots of small pieces, causing the \"explosion\".", "id": "d7zdpud"}, {"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "d7zq0wc"}, {"comment": "I know people who meal prep and go from the freezer to the oven, or microwave with pyrex.", "id": "d7yc3la"}, {"comment": "Do you have source -even anecdotal reviews- for the makita one?

As such, they could not replace the straps.\n\nSeeing as she paid $200 for the bag, she just wanted something functional and said that non-matching straps from a current backpack would be sufficient. They refused to repair the backpack. According to the warranty, they would repair or replace it.\n\nHowever they refuse to replace the bag, offering a 30% discount on the purchase of a new bag. This was not satisfactory, and she was advised to try calling or emailing on Monday (today)\n\nShe sent an email the morning expressing her displeasure with the outcome Saturday, and referenced the warranty on the website. The owner of the company offered 50% off of a new backpack, saying the warranty was outdated and had changed (with no warning to current owners). After this reply, the warranty copy on the website changed, as reflected in the link.\n\nAs a student, buying a new backpack is not in the budget, especially when she purchased the original bag under the presumption that they would stand behind their product. She offered to pay for the new strap as she just wanted to get her bag fixed, but they refused. They only want to sell a new bag. Trying to hold them to the warranty that was originally offered has been dodged in replies. \n\nWe feel we have run out of options in getting this bag fixed.

Thank you to everyone here who offered their advice and support!\n\n(Also, I don't know if it's possible for a mod to sticky towards the top that this issue has been resolved)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nStory: my girlfriend bought a backpack from Rickshaw in 2011. One deciding factor in making the purchase was the warranty, which stated \"no matter how long you\u2019ve owned it[the bag] \u2013 we will repair it or replace it \u2013 whichever option you prefer.\"\n\nThe foam in the right strap has collapsed, causing it to lose its structure and making it uncomfortable to wear. The left strap looks perfectly fine. Something seems amiss as she does not wear the backpack regularly on just one strap, and the decomposition between the two straps is so drastically different.\n\nWhen she brought the bag into the store Saturday, they said they do not make that backpack anymore, and as components were sourced from overseas they do not have replacement components available for the bag. As such, they could not replace the straps.\n\nSeeing as she paid $200 for the bag, she just wanted something functional and said that non-matching straps from a current backpack would be sufficient. They refused to repair the backpack. According to the warranty, they would repair or replace it.\n\nHowever they refuse to replace the bag, offering a 30% discount on the purchase of a new bag. This was not satisfactory, and she was advised to try calling or emailing on Monday (today)\n\nShe sent an email the morning expressing her displeasure with the outcome Saturday, and referenced the warranty on the website. The owner of the company offered 50% off of a new backpack, saying the warranty was outdated and had changed (with no warning to current owners). After this reply, the warranty copy on the website changed, as reflected in the link.\n\nAs a student, buying a new backpack is not in the budget, especially when she purchased the original bag under the presumption that they would stand behind their product. She offered to pay for the new strap as she just wanted to get her bag fixed, but they refused. They only want to sell a new bag. Trying to hold them to the warranty that was originally offered has been dodged in replies. \n\nWe feel we have run out of options in getting this bag fixed. It has left a bad flavor in our mouths, and want to warn other people before they are disappointed by this company if they expected to receive a durable, well supported product.", "id": "d58uzyq"}, {"comment": "\"The warranty has changed\" isn't a valid defense.

Not as sharp but wears like iron. Still probably takes a far better edge than any $25 chefs knife. If I had to guess, any knife tempered to that high hardness will be fairly delicate (chip and crack prone) so dont try to use it as a cleaver and dont drop it on the floor. It may or may not be as rust resistant as cheap kitchen knives so dont leave it sitting with tomato juice on the blade for hours. Hand wash only, NEVER dishwash a good knife no matter what the ad says.\n\nVictorinox has been considered top rnd for non-forged knives for a long time, but most properly forged knives are better. I would think the drafons are much better knives. I may check out deals on Global (VG10 steel iirc) and the standards (Henkels, Wustof, Shun). The Henkels and Wustof knives wont hold an edge as well as the others but take a better edge more easily than the Dragons.\n\nAs for sharpening, thats not a skill easily just picked up. It takes a lot of practice and work to do and learn and stones have the potential to ruin a knife. Easy pull through or electric sharpeners have no place around a good kitchen knife.

This is one of those rumors that has been passed down from virtually every source I've seen.\n\nIt could be more of an accelerated degredation due to temperature thing. Higher end steels do tend to break down and soften over time. The same knife 100 years from now will be softer, which is why higher-end steels are considered unstable. Washing could be completely insignificant too, I don't know.\n\nThat said, putting a low-end, highly stain resistant knife in hot water while the blade is protected (ie not rattling against things in the dish washer) probably amounts to nothing. I dish wash my cheapo knives too. But any higher-end steel will have less corrosion resistance. My high-ish end Hattori can't even be air dried or it will rust.

A rollerball is NOT a ballpoint. A rollerball uses liquid ink much like a fountain pen. The lines are thicker, darker, and smoother than a ballpoint. The only way it saves on ink at all is by writing a finer line, which can to some extent be tweaked on your fountain.\n\nA ballpoint like the standard bic uses a paste, which is scrapes ink. This is how a ballpoint gets a thinner line - It simply doesn't put as much ink on the paper. It's also why they don't bleed through on cheap paper, or ball up on slightly water-resistent paper. I would be willing to bet that it's also why it skips more and doesn't feel as smooth. It literally uses friction. Your fountain pen does not.\n\nside note, this is actually a problem at my work. I used to write on thin labels with a plastic backing, as well as at least 3 different grades of cheap paper. A ballpoint works fine and almost identically on all of them. A rollerball (which I used briefly) performs drastically differently on each, and on some you could literally see the ink bead up before drying.\n\nBut yeah, rollerball is a fair comparison for the type of ink you're looking at, but it's NOT a fair comparison to a standard far cheaper ballpoint.\n\nthe rest of the properties of their specific ink are great for selling points. They're trying to compare quality vs quality, in a way that shows off all of their specific good qualities. But price... they're picking a rigged battle.\n\nInstead of volume of ink, what we really need is distance written. I don't have that exact number, but I'll put this into a bit of perspective.\n\nBack when I used a fountain pen that held 0.5 ml at a time, it lasted roughly a week of daily use (EF point btw). Goulet pens has Noodlers black in a 4.5 ounce for $18.00. That's 133 ml (thanks google), so I'm getting 266 weeks out of that $18 (plus shipping of course). That breaks down to just over 5 years. \n\nSince we're going economy and stacking the favor to noodlers, I'll do more than a 1/2 second search on amazon. I'll do a 15 second search and get the better deal. They have a [pack of 100](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DN8T3QC/ref=AmazonBasics_HQP?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=hero-quick-promo&pf_rd_r=PGJVFG8AFQBCVG9NNXVT&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=2618734842&pf_rd_i=B0012YVGOW) for $7.49. OK, so buy 2, now you have 200 pens. $15.\n\nDivide by years, you get 40 pens a year. I can literally throw out a ballpoint every 2 weeks and still have pens left over.

You may want moisturizing soap, or you could just use lotion after using regular bar soap. Overall the benefits are minimal, but the difference in the lather production is the most noticeable difference.

Can I see the part of the belts where the buckle usually touches the leather?", "id": "d2wge14"}, {"comment": "There has been some [stretching and cracking](http://i.imgur.com/591jPTv.jpg), but if I cared more about treating the leather occasionally I think it would have fared much better.

Both of them look suspicious to me, I'm going to guess that there is a \"Genuine Leather\" stamp or tag somewhere on the backs?  \n\nI think what we have here is the Chicken McNugget of the leather world.  \"Genuine Leather\" is basically shavings mixed with glue and plastic, formed around a strip of plastic that has been reinforced sort of like the strings on duct tape.  They put this into a mold that has a fake grain on it.  You can test it, leather will burn but not really catch fire easily.  A composite will flame up, even having liquid drip off of it as it literally melts.\n\nSo they call it leather but it just technically has some leather in it.  Leather will not crack unless it gets very dry.  It's hard to tell from the pictures, but one tell-tale area is the holes.  They appear to be smooth with the same texture and finish as the belt's face.  That would be very unusual for all but the most high-end designer belts.  To do that on real leather you would have to edge-paint and burnish every single hole.  \n\nEdit: You can also see it in the texture.  The new belt is smooth.  The old one seems to have more texture.  That's a result of the glued mess forming and compressing around the shape of the actual leather shavings.  Leather that is only rubbed and not folded (like the keeper loop) should get smoother.  If you look specifically at the keeper loops, the light shows that the new one is smooth and the old is looking like painted particle board.  That would be very unusual for leather.

You want one contiguous piece of hide in a 9/10 oz range (for a casual belt).  That means it will be about 3.5-4.0mm thick.  \n\nIf you want to be able to swap buckles, you should have a belt that uses Chicago screws which are like rivets that work like screws.  If you don't care to swap the buckle, you can use rivets (ok) or stitching (ideal).  You want the stitching to go with the belt, not across it.  Perforating for stitching will weaken the material if you do it across.  Not much, but when considering BIFL every detail matters.  For construction, that's it.  \n\nNow for details, you want the edges burnished so they are smooth and not \"hairy\" and the corners rounded off with a beveler.

(I'm not sure what you meant by \"heavy duty\") \n\nI've worked an office job for close to a decade and it honestly has nothing to do with the area I live in, the crime statistics near my workplace, or how I was raised. I was mugged 3 times before I turned 17 and joined the military. Once I was enlisted some of my training took place in Mississippi post-hurricane Katrina. Anyone who had any sort of savings or family outside of the state got the hell out of there. This of course left behind a large population of criminals who saw abandoned houses filled with copper as opportunities to strip for anything valuable and squat in to do drugs. 2 times while I was there walking to the mall / blockbuster (the only places open) I was confronted by people offering me drugs and then attempting to take my wallet when I refused. Both times I just out ran them because I was in the best shape of my life at this point. 1 other time I was caught off guard by a guy on the other side of a bus stop and he pulled a knife on me to rob me. The way he had me standing put me in a corner with him holding a knife in front of him. I gave him my velcro burner wallet with 10 bucks in it and some receipts and old business cards in case I got mugged again. He took the wallet and ran. After I called the cops I stood there for 45 minutes before I got a call back from the dispatch asking me where I was again because the cops had forgot. \n\nThat was enough being a victim for me. Especially now that I have a family I am not willing to risk anything happening to them. I mostly shoot every couple of weeks for fun, but I also spend about 150 rounds each time I go out dedicated to practicing my draw and firing without lining up my sights. I've gotten pretty proficient at hitting center mass by lining up my front post on a draw. I'm also very confident in my ability to draw from concealed quickly and discretely. I don't dream of the day \"I get to teach some punk a lesson\" or \"show them that if it comes down to me or them, it's gonna be them\". I know there's a small vocal group in the firearm community that comes off as not jobs and believe me we see them that way too. For those of us that take this as seriously as it needs to be understand that taking a life is your very last line of defense. So far I've been carrying for 8 years and I've only placed my hand on my firearm once without revealing it. I believed that a person in a shop was going to rob it the way he barged in with his hood and sunglasses obstructing his face. When he got inside and saw how many people were in there I think it spooked him and he ran. \n\nAnyways I went long winded, but my point is I've been carrying for almost a decade and in doing so I've learned a lot about where to steer clear of and what kind of people not to interact with as to avoid me being dependent on my firearm. I also feel comfortable knowing that if anyone wanted to break into my home at night I have it within arms reach and could quickly defend my wife and children. Someone recently broke into a house in my neighborhood and forced the homeowner to get dressed at gun point and drive him to an ATM. When the owner was in the closet \"getting his wallet\" he drew his firearm and killed the man. I know everyone likes to believe that this never happens, but when it's so close to home it really sets things straight in your mind. ", "id": "d3zvtrd"}, {"comment": "Thanks, I enjoyed reading that.

Key travel is also less; keys on an HP keyboard move a certain distance when pressed, but the L keys don't move as far.  Maybe half the distance?  A third as much?   It's hard to tell.  The clicky feedback is also louder on the \"L\" keyboards.  The \"L\" keys, despite being only ever-so-slightly smaller, are slightly harder to read, as the fonts are smaller.  The HP keys are also beveled, unlike the \"L\" keys, which are flat.  I believe the top \"printing\" of the HP keys are actually injection-molded, and so shouldn't wear off; the printing on the \"L\" keys appear to be, well, printed on.\n\nIt's hard to say, but I think the \"L\" keyboards should be fine for light to medium use.  My fingers might get tired if I used those keyboards a lot.\n\nI should also mumble a bit about the build quality: while the L models have a metal back, do not flex when gently twisted (the HP models do), and are a bit heavier, the cosmetics aren't as good.  For example, I think the front metal bezel on my DM 15L looks a bit \"dirty\".  The bezel on my HP 15C LE is very finely brushed, but the DM 15L bezel seems to be coarsely brushed.  Some coarse lines seem darker, and others seem lighter, giving the overall appearance of being ever-so-slightly dirty.

I'm slowly trying to figure out solutions for all my gadgets that use them.  By 2020 when the Gigafactory (and other similar factories) start pumping out billions of cells a year, they will be cheap as sin and excellent.  Your device actually gets better as the batteries get better.\n\nRight now I'm trying to find someone who makes a 2-way radio/walkman that takes them.  It seems no-one does somehow, which makes no sense to me.  2 cells in series would be ~7.6-7.8v, which is pretty much spot on where many walkie talkies run at currently, yet no-one has modded the guts of one to run on two 18650s yet.", "id": "d4n6v25"}, {"comment": "I'm not convinced they are much different. It may be an illusion because 18650s are stacked cells and not single cell batteries.  Why is it that laptop batteries never seem to last more than 5 years? They are made up entirely of 18650s.", "id": "d4nab8p"}, {"comment": "They used to be made up of 18650s before the thin-ness started consuming everything.  Laptop batteries use pouch cells now like cell phones since they can be far thinner.\n\nSo we're talking about 18650s that were manufactured in 2007-2009.  There are entire communities that go around dumpster diving to find the good 2008-2009 cells from laptop batteries.  Most are often still salvageable for a decent 8 or 9 wH cell that has ~200+ cycles left.\n\nThose outside the communities that use them often (vapers and flashlight enthusiasts mostly) don't really realize how much a revolution there has been in the last 5 years in 18650s.\n\nIn the past, even drawing 15 amps (50-60 watts) from a cell was not a good idea.  These high draw cells are used in vaping a lot.  Specialized cells designed for 15 amps had drastically reduced capacity, often only giving you 6 minutes from a charge.  This often completely trashing these cells to less than 70% capacity after only 250-300 cycles.  They'd be like $20 each too.\n\nNow we have cells that cost less than half as much that allows 20 amps (70-80 watts) that last for ~9 minutes (at the higher current draw) and can be cycled 400-500 times before losing more than 10-20% of their capacity.    This is almost 7 times as much value.  (200% capacity, 170% more longevity, 50% price) before you even consider the ability to draw more amps than was ever possible before.\n\nThen you have to high capacity cells for things like flashlights that need far less amperage.  I have a two 18650 torch that has a 'moonlight' function that puts out 20 lumen (dim, but enough to see in the dark to do a task in hand).  At that setting, it can run continuously for over 200 hours.  That's with two $8 cells that last for over 500 cycles.  At 1000 lumens it lasts for about 5 hours.\n\nA mag-light that uses four D cells to put out less light and cost a dollar per \"charge\" that lasts about 10 hours constant usage..  So your talking $1000 vs $20 in battery costs for the same usage.  Let alone to fact my light weighs less than half as much as is far less bulky.\n\nThe cells that will be coming out of the giga-factory in 2019 will probably only be slightly better than the best we see today (3000mAh high amperage cells, 3400mAh high capacity cells) but they will be *cheap*.  $3 each probably, vs the $8 you spend each today for these high end cells.

I'm not a metallurgist, but I do know there are several different types of zamak and the corrosion resistance increases with higher aluminum content.

None of the razor repair places I know of will touch a zamak razor, and I don't know the technical reasons for this, but it's consider unfixable when there is a problem.\n\n\nI'd agree that shaving hobbyists get carried away with some things.   For example, I've always been fine with barbasol, and \"canned goo\" is pretty much blasphemy to those guys.   But this isn't a case of \"zamak is evil,\" in fact a lot of those guys love their Merkurs.   They just don't expect them to last forever.\n\n\nI know this post is lacking on proof, I tried finding one authoritative source for proof, but mostly it's anecdotal.   So, forgive me for this broad suggestion but google \"zamak razor\" and you'll find plenty of stories of people's razors breaking and having to be tossed.   You just don't see that with brass or stainless steel razors.    People buy the vintage brass ones in all states of disrepair and are able to bring them back to life.   Repair shops exist in case it's beyond someone's personal capabilities.

Currently Solovair operate from one, and Dr Martens continue making shoes in the other. The two factories are so close you could probably throw a shoe from one to the other.

A Li-Ion cell is fully charged at 4.2V, the nominal voltage is 3.7V and they shouldn't be drained below 3.0V.\n\n[There are plenty of different sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes#Cylindrical_lithium-ion_rechargeable_battery), which may be confusing at first, but it's quite easy. The model number tells the size; first two numbers are the width (diameter) in mm, the next two numbers are the length in mm. For instance, 18350 cells are 18mm wide and 35mm long. 18350 and 18650 seem to be the most common around, but my perspective might be a little skewed since I get them for e-cigarrettes and repurpose them for other things once they've lost too much capacity.\n\nI use a 18350 in my flashlight that had originally an AAA 3-cell holder, but since it's smaller I used some tape padding around it to prevent it from rattling loosely and had to stretch the negative-end spring in the battery compartment.

The disparity between your own lifetime and the lifetime of the product can be very large, and definitely enough to make someone with the audacity to put a big \"lifetime warranty\" badge on their products seem a bit sleazy. say \"5 year warranty\" or say \"rips, tears and spills warranty\" or whatever you like, but to tell me it lasts as long as it lasts, and then to tell me that the details are in the conditions.. you may aswell have said little to nothing. or tell me its got the xyz gaurantee, then il understand that theres something to look in to. but yeah, most people do not know that life time warranty is not a specific measurement, but that one man can buy 2 products both with lifetime warranties and both warranties will end at different times. Or at the very least have the decency to say \"lifetime warranty\" then in small letters below it \"see details\"\n\n\nthe reason people put their badge on their products is because most people dont have the audacity to take someone up on their lifetime warranty, but the fact that the company making the product in question had the balls to put it there suggests that the product must be half decent. its a shitty thing to put on your product, and as ive said, most people think lifetime warranty means your own life time. and you cant blame them. it seems bizarre to make a statement like \"this product lasts as long as its lifetime\" oh yeah. great. thanks for telling me. can you tell me what the percieved lifetime of the product is right there? a lifetime warranty could, theoretically, be complete shit. thats hwat im saying.\n\nonce again, you may as well throw a badge on there that literally says \"this product has a warranty\" and nothing more. thats how much legitimate information youre conveying when you put the words \"lifetime warranty\" on a product.", "id": "d346oof"}, {"comment": "Pedantry is what makes reddit great!", "id": "d34ba7v"}, {"comment": "Shouldn't be very long if you actually use it for pretty much the only thing it's good for.", "id": "d345fgs"}, {"comment": "It's kinda the same for leatherman.

That is a human right, that cannot be taken away, only infringed upon. \n\nNow as far as whether voting is \"doing something\"?  Well sure, you are doing something by voting--you are expending time and energy, and using the system that is set up, but is it actually accomplishing anything?  Mathematically your vote is meaningless, obviously less so in local decisions than national ones, but even locally your vote in particular, is not likely to make an actual difference.   \n\nBut having said this, if you believe in voting, then you should vote.

Organize, run for office, hand out flyers, call in to radio shows, protest, donate time and money to causes you believe in.  All of these things will do *way* more to change things than your specific vote.\n\n> No, mathematically it means something, a small, albeit real meaning.\n\nWell, I probably should have used the word \"statistically\" instead of \"mathmatically\"  to be more accurate.  Your vote is, in any large election, statistically insignificant.  Even in local contest, if 10000 votes are cast your vote is .01%, which is, by most any definition, statistically insignificant.  Sorry, but that is just a fact.\n\nI said I generally do vote. A few years ago I decided I could no longer vote for the \"lesser of two evils\" so I have voted for third party, written in names, or abstained from certain races.

Old vacuum tube electronics are often *incredibly* robust.  I've collected vacuum tube gear since 1998 and build my own hi-fi gear.  My oldest piece of equipment is an Atwater-Kent neutrodyne radio, built in 1926.  It still works.\n\nMost old vacuum tube equipment was built in the point-to-point style.  Today's electronics are almost always built on a PCB.  PCBs lower costs, but they are fragile and easily damaged.  If you scorch a PCB or damage the traces, you either  have a big repair job or will need a new PCB.  Replacing a PCB is not fun - you have to desolder and re-solder *everything.*\n\nPoint-to-point construction (and I am including construction with terminal strips, terminal lugs, et al. in this description) does not use a PCB and is *far* easier to repair.  Point-to-point means construction that will hold up for 90 years (like in my old Atwater-Kent) and should easily last another 100 years.  If a wire goes bad, you simply solder in a new one.  Takes five minutes.  You can swap in new capacitors and resistors just as easily.  You *do* have to replace capacitors and resistors every so often, but it's not difficult.  I consider it basic maintenance, and that something can still be BIFL if it requires maintenance.\n\nAlso, vacuum tubes are still in production and they can be good for decades.  When tube gear stops working, 95% of the time it's a bad capacitor.  It is rarely a failed tube.  I've restored many old radios that were dead, but all of the tubes were still good.  It was failed capacitors, though sometimes failed resistors killed it.  Further, many of the times when a tube dies it is he direct result of a failed capacitor or resistor.  When you have good, modern resistors and capacitors in tube gear, the tubes last for a very, very long time.", "id": "cykovct"}], [{"comment": "Best calculator ever! I still have mine too.

You can cut wood to an exact measurement in the evening and it will be measurably different in the morning.\n\nTraditional woodworking often doesn't use many measurements.  You cut wood to fit other pieces, not to a particular measurement, since wood is moving.  This is also why traditional joinery is so important.  All of the cheap shortcuts, like pocket hole screws, don't account for wood movement.  That's why those shortcut methods don't hold up well in the long term.  Also, traditional joints are the strongest, and that's been scientifically proven with stress tests.  That's why traditional joinery has been used for centuries.  It is not being \"snobby\" or \"elitist\" or \"pretentious.\"  Those get thrown around on the woodworking subs when someone says that a Kreg jig is not the best way to build.  It's about doing things the right way, the way that makes furniture hold up for centuries instead of maybe ten years.\n\nHere, you have a whole bunch of pieces glued together.  If there's variation in moisture, the pieces will move at different rates and the block will crack.  That's why they do it.", "id": "d0nb5e3"}, {"comment": "Check this post today from /r/woodworking to see why dry wood matters: https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/48savg/well_s/\n\nWood changes size with moisture content, if it's fixed to other wood In the wrong direction, or with a different moisture content, bad things happen.

In a properly oiled block this action only takes place at the very edge of the surface too, so the board loses this trapped moisture rapidly after being wiped off as well.\n\nYou need to sterilize so much in a commercial kitchen because it's boards are non porous and stay damp on the surface.

(At least the main block portion, not the legs, was a single piece of wood.)\n\nI spent about a month with them every summer when I was growing up, and I fell in love with it. It just seemed solid, and old-world (much like your cast-iron and vintage pyrex feel), and had some sort of deep emotional appeal. My uncle also collected vintage straight razors; it had the same sort of old world appeal to me as those.\n\nAs a result, I've wanted one for over 20 years now. First off, though, you can't get one like they had anymore, at least not in good condition. All the trees that were big enough to cut a block that size from have now already been cut down, or are now in protected regions. As a result, there are no new ones like they had available.\n\nI did a ton of research on used ones as well. They fall into one of two categories. Either, they are well cared for family heirlooms (that no one is selling) or they were used out on a fishing dock for 40 years to hack fish heads off and clean guts (and are filled with all manner of exotic fish bacteria and are dried out and cracking from the rain and sun).\n\nMore recently, I've also been cooking a *lot*. Typically, real, home-cooked meals from scratch several times a week. I didn't have enough room to trim a full brisket or prep tons of veggies before, adding to my desire for one.\n\nBecause these things are so daggone big and heavy, I didn't want to actually buy one until I had my own home and wasn't planning to move for a good long while.

So far so good, tools feel of good build quality and i have had no size issues. i like the roll up case - everything stays put and it takes little room when not in use.\n\nStanley also makes some great tools, I have a socket set from them where both the tools and case feel of quality build.

I think lighter weight linen shrinks a bit more because of the looser weave maybe. But shrinkage is not a big problem. \n\nDecide how big you want your towels then add two inches to each dimension for seam allowance (so there's an extra inch of fabric all around the outside edge). \n\nI used a serger to seal all the edges so they wouldn't fray. If you use a serger, you don't even have to do any more if you don't want. But I wanted my towels to look a little more finished so I folded the edges over once and sewed them down. \n\nYou can still see the serged edge on one side and some people might not like that look, but the alternative is to fold the fabric over twice to hide the edge. We used quite a heavy fabric and that didn't seem like a good option at the time, but for a lighter weight linen I think it would be no problem. \n\nI think you could also use a zigzag stitch instead of a serger stitch if you wanted, but you would have to then fold the edge over at least once like I did to avoid issues with fraying. \n\nWe sewed loops into one of the short edges of each towel... but I'm not sure it was worth it. If I was doing it again I would probably use a lighter weight fabric so that part of the towel was less bulky and I could make a better seam holding them in (a couple of ours have pulled out and need to be repaired). The towels get very heavy when wet and the loops need to be not only strong, but strongly secured. A lighter weight linen would have worked well for the loops I think. To make the loops we surged a ~2\" wide strip on each side, then folded it in three and did a plain stitch down the middle to hold yet together. \n\nLet me know if there are any details I've left out. :)", "id": "d8mtlxb"}, {"comment": "> [But shrinkage is not a big problem.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4a/e9/08/4ae908d2d2580c0698ff2114c15bd0ea.jpg)\n\n", "id": "d8nh9a1"}, {"comment": "That's a lot of washcloths", "id": "d8nclkz"}, {"comment": "Children.

Compare them to fancy [multicoloured hiking boots](https://www.rei.com/search.html?q=hiking+boots&ir=q%3Ahiking+boots&page=1), for example.

I wear chaco sandals as they are slightly more low key than OP's.  \n\nOP's hat is obviously a fancy developed world item but the neutral color helps. Hats sit on top of your head and hence stick out in a crowd where the rest of you might be less obvious from afar.\n \n\nI have an old green (ex-military) backpack that is all dusty and messed up.  It does not stick out as military any more and could be anybody's bag on that crappy repurposed school bus  you are taking for 8 hours on a dirt road.

Otherwise, they're extremely comfortable and I can walk in them all day.  Every three or four months I'll wash them in the tub and let air dry.\n\nSo far, not much wear on the soles, the stitching and glue have held up, and they look great.

Military surplus gear can be really nice and cheap and robust, but the downside is elucidated well by /u/canyoubelivethisguy .\n\n\n\nIf at all possible, it is great to be able to somewhat blend in. This is not always possible as there are things about oneself one cannot change.  Gear, however, you can at least make it blend in somewhat. \n\nBackpacks, boots, hats, other stuff like that often stick out like a sore thumb.   Here at /r/BIFL we have the desire for high quality gear that does the job well for a long time. But maybe part of the job of your gear is to not stick out and/or get stolen. \n\nIn this case, OP's boots are pretty low key, they blend in somewhat. Compare them to fancy [multicoloured hiking boots](https://www.rei.com/search.html?q=hiking+boots&ir=q%3Ahiking+boots&page=1), for example.  I have worn old leather military boots all over the place and they are just black boots.  I mostly keep them dusty and get a shoeshine before going to the airport or into a fancier zone.  I wear chaco sandals as they are slightly more low key than OP's.  \n\nOP's hat is obviously a fancy developed world item but the neutral color helps. Hats sit on top of your head and hence stick out in a crowd where the rest of you might be less obvious from afar.\n \n\nI have an old green (ex-military) backpack that is all dusty and messed up.  It does not stick out as military any more and could be anybody's bag on that crappy repurposed school bus  you are taking for 8 hours on a dirt road.   It blends in far more than a lot of the [other versions of OP's rucksack](http://ilequipment.com/collections/all). \n\nThanks OP for showing us your stuff and prompting this discussion. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "d3kfpfy"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the comment and the advice. I am definitely in agreement. I have a lot of travel ahead of me, and will definitely be looking into replacing the backpack with something low-key. It's perfect as an everyday bag in the USA, but as a world travel rucksack, you're right- it definitely draws attention, and that's definitely a bad thing.\n\nAs for the hat, it looks a lot more beat-up in person. Sweat stains, oxidized brass, off-white and beat up. I don't think it has the typical Tilley first-world charm anymore. \n\nAnd the Gobi's look low-key from day one.

I use it to make coffee in the morning, and it makes *consistently good* coffee, has all the functions it needs for that task, is completely bulletproof (unlike 2 more expensive coffeemakers that busted on me before I bought it), and requires absolutely minimal effort. \n\nYes, less effort than a French press (which I have to pay attention to, and continues to brew once it's finished or requires a second container, and requires clean-up) or an Aeropress (which is a *little* finicky, also requires more setup and clean-up, I have to pay attention to it, and it requires me to heat more water separately since it essentially makes coffee concentrate). Yes, a French press and an Aeropress both make better coffee, but honestly, I love coffee but can't really taste the difference when I'm half-awake at 6am. I'm not saying a French press or an Aeropress are bad, I've owned and used both, but for me, 90% of the time, the Mr Coffee is *better.* I'm not pretending to be Joel Robuchon when I'm stuffing oatmeal in my face in a weekday morning haze.\n\nThe only thing that requires less effort is a Keurig, which can only make bad-to-mediocre coffee (you might love your Keurig, but deep down you know this), and Keurig cups are much more expensive and wasteful, and it's actually not easier if you consider I drink 2-3 cups every morning and then my wife comes along an hour later and drinks 1 or 2 more. And even though I can barely taste the difference between Mr Coffee and a French press at 6am, I can absolutely taste the difference with a Keurig.\n\nSo, to summarize, if your goal is several cups of good coffee in the morning with minimal effort, an old school drip coffeemaker really is probably your best option. My Mr Coffee was dirt cheap, does the job as well as any of the more expensive ones I've used (and better than many), and has all the options I've ever needed - regular and strong brew option, timed start, and auto-shut off.  \n\nMr Coffee is popular for a reason, its the Toyota Camry of coffeemakers, and yes I mean that as a compliment. Unless you're a coffee fetishist (even at 6 in the morning), or really are a Keurig type (ie, you don't mind paying more for weak coffee, and just want a single serving at literally the push of a button), this really is the coffeemaker you need, and will use 90% of the time. \n\nA+++ would absolutely buy again.", "id": "czb4vkq"}, {"comment": "I think we can all agree that Keurig sucks.", "id": "czbi4lx"}, {"comment": "> if your goal is several cups of good coffee in the morning with minimal effort,\n\nIf your goal is *good* coffee you should get an SCAA certified brewer instead of a cheap-o brewer that doesn't brew at a good temperature or get good ground coverage.", "id": "czh09ia"}, {"comment": "> Let's do the toaster math.

Only watch out for acidic stuff like tomato sauce, as regular use could damage the seasoning.

Getting a super-duper slick surface can be tricky, but you don't need that.  Even with a mediocre surface, nothing will stick if you use a little cooking oil.

They're just hipster fashionable.\n\nI have a cast iron pan.  I inherited it from my grandmother.  It makes a nice piece of decoration in the kitchen.  Of course I'm keeping it.  Cooking with it, no way.\n\nI cook on tri-ply stainless.  It has many advantages over cast iron.  First, tri-ply heats more evenly because it is a sandwich of stainless, aluminum and stainless.  Great conductivity and even heating.  Two, it is just as durable as cast iron and won't shatter or crack if you accidentally drop it on a tile floor.  Third, you can put it in a dishwasher. \n\nThere are only two things to remember:\n\n1. Heat the pan before adding butter or oil.  Tri-ply becomes nonstick when you do this.\n\n2. Let tri-ply cool to room temperature before washing it.  Plunging it into cold water can warp the pan.\n\nThat's it.\n\nIf you already have cast iron, go ahead and use it.  It works.  If you are shopping for pots and pans, buy tri-ply.  You can find inexpensive sets from Cuisinart on Amazon and Tramontina at Wal-Mart.

Pouring water over that is just under boiling and time it for 4:00. Do not mix the coffee at any point. While this allows you to taste all the flavour notes it is also very inefficient.\n\nI personally use the \"extract the %@#* out of it\" press method. I don't mind silt in my coffee and I find it wasteful to use 2tbsp of grinds per 6oz cup like in the taster's method. I usually grind much finer than the coarse french press grind. I use water just under boiling and do not stir. I use 5 tablespoons of the fine grind. I time it for four minutes.

The '60s weren't great, but the '70s were *terrible* for it. [Look at this list.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_hijackings)\n\nYou'll see that the drop-off in skyjackings didn't happen in 2001, but in the late 80s and 90s. That's due to the [1985 International Security and Development Cooperation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Air_Marshal_Service#History) which brought armed marshalls on high-risk and random flights. \n\nThat's when flying became safe again. All the TSA regulations do is urge people to try to circumvent them, and at the same time, it obligates white-hats (who might demonstrate how to make a weapon using only material found past the checkpoints) to expose further flaws. They should've just expanded the FAM service. There are about 3600 commercial jets in the air at any given time. We have only 50 FAMs in the air at any given time, sometimes less. 9/11 only had 33 FAMs in the air. \n\nWe should've put an armed guard on every other flight. That would've resulted in a hiring a few thousand more FAMs, but it wouldn't have hired a hundred-thousand every-day Walmart workers (since we're talking actual armed guards expecting to have to use it - TSA has no authority to arrest, or use force, or carry a weapon). \n\nAnd that's why they didn't do that: The jobs package of the TSA was the biggest sell of the whole thing. It only marginally had anything at all to do with security, and everything to do with creating thousands and thousands of low-wage, no-training jobs, and then subsidizing their equipment costs. Why not, right? The cost is all coming from the tax-payer. So if they spend money on equipment - buying from companies they have back-door deals with - it's not *their* money, and they get kicked back in their next campaign. Those xray scanners (that didn't work)? $160 million. \n\nThe TSA is the bastard child of greed and political capital. It has almost zero to do with security. Security would've been cheap and easy.

I look a bit overburdened when I carry them on my backpack with a carabiner and a maxpedition bottle carrier. The larger ones have carry straps that make them easier to manage than a thermos, too.\n\nThe zojirushi bento box kicks ass as well.
