Leonard Maltin would include it in his list of \"100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century\" as one of only two movies from the 1980s. George Will was one of the few to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?E.T.+the+Extra-Terrestrial+%281982%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/et_the_extraterrestrial/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/et-the-extra-terrestrial), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/60024058), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11621).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F5624ev \"Confidence: 1.09\").

Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl's ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami\\: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home.

Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a \"woeful, depressing failure\" and stating that the \"cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid the wreckage of the Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue.\" Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticizing the film's treatment of its political message as being \"fairly dim, adolescent stuff,\" as well as expressing dislike for the \"barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult.\" On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says \"it's not hard to see why,\" as well as criticising Portman's performance\\: \"Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance.\" Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RT\u00c9 states the film \"works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any\\/all of the three\". He added that the film will become \"a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age.\" Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is \"a bit of a mess... it rarely thrills or engages as a story.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?V+for+Vendetta+%282005%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=V%20for%20Vendetta%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/v_for_vendetta/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/v-for-vendetta), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70039175), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5890).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4plx9c \"Confidence: 1.12\").

Saved from a life-and-death situation by a man in a Guy Fawkes mask who calls himself V, she learns a general summary of V's past and, after a time, decides to help him bring down those who committed the atrocities that led to Britain being in the shape that it is in.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Ebert and Roeper gave the film a \"two thumbs up\" rating. Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta \"almost always has something going on that is actually interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will\". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a \"woeful, depressing failure\" and stating that the \"cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid the wreckage of the Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue.\" Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticizing the film's treatment of its political message as being \"fairly dim, adolescent stuff,\" as well as expressing dislike for the \"barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult.\" On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says \"it's not hard to see why,\" as well as criticising Portman's performance\\: \"Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance.\" Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RT\u00c9 states the film \"works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any\\/all of the three\". He added that the film will become \"a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age.\" Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is \"a bit of a mess... it rarely thrills or engages as a story.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?V+for+Vendetta+%282005%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=V%20for%20Vendetta%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/v_for_vendetta/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/v-for-vendetta), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70039175), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5890).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4plx9c \"Confidence: 1.12\").

It's essentially a bet against a stock or bond.

That is such an unlikely and unprecedented occurrence that they were able to negotiate a colossal return on that \"bet,\" which is why they all had dollar signs popping out of their eyes through the whole film.\n\n**ARMs, or adjustable rate mortgages:** An absolutely disgusting bait and switch tactic used to rope poor people into mortgages they can't afford. The creditor hands out a large loan which is fixed at a low rate for a limited time. After that period of time, the monthly bill on the mortgage changes based on, I don't know, the price of rice in China. In all cases it goes up substantially.\n\nThose two Florida douches were selling these in the film. The pitch is, \"Hey, I can put you in your own home for less than you're paying in rent right now. Don't worry about the rate going up, that's years down the road, besides, you'll have plenty of money by then! Look at what you're going to save!\"\n\n**NINJAs, or no income, no job, or assets:** The catchy acronym which refers to the poor mooks who got sold these shitty mortgages.\n\n**CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations:** An absolutely disgusting bait and switch tactic used to rope wealthy people into investments that will never pay a return. The depositor creates a financial instrument where shitty ARMs (which were sold to literal homeless people in some cases) get packaged together along with the mortgage on Bill Gates' fifth summer home and divided up into little slices. It's sort of like eating at Barth's, if you know there's a dead body somewhere in the building, [it's safe to assume it's going to end up in the burgers.](http://i.imgur.com/EHMOLgI.jpg)\n\n[Here's a helpful diagram of how to make a shit sandwich in your own kitchen at home.](http://i.imgur.com/qtGfmiy.jpg)\n\nYou create a normal sandwich of your choice, then you place it on top of a cow pie. The money gets poured on top. Once the top part fills up, it spills over onto the next slice. Everyone who had a slice on top gets to keep the money. The people on the lower slices get to keep a little bit more. When the money runs out, the one at the bottom doesn't get a drop, even though they got the slice of cowshit. Here's the best part though: if that happens enough times, everyone has to take a bite of the sandwich and find out just how good that shit at the bottom tastes.\n\nBy \"everyone,\" that means anyone with a stock portfolio, anyone with a pension, and pretty much anyone whose life is even remotely affected by the status of a mutual fund. Nearly everybody bought into the shit sandwich. Even the people who have never owned a mortgage in their lives got a taste. U.S. housing bonds were considered the safest of safe bets besides actual Treasury bonds.

A product that most definitely has its place, value, and use.  What was absolutely disgusting was not the product itself, but the way it was sold in a misleading, inappropriate way to people who should never have had an ARM in the first place.

", "id": "d7tiye1"}, {"comment": "Certainly-\n\nOne example of an ARM being appropriate is if you have a high level of certainty that you will not be owning the property for longer than the fixed period of the ARM, with the BIG caveat that you can afford to refinance should your plans change and rates go up.\n\nI have a situation close to this- my wife and I purchased a terrible (foreclosed) house on an amazing lot.  The plan is to rebuild within 5-7 years, at which point we would need to obtain new financing anyway.  The cost of the house was well below what we could afford, such that if interest rates go up a huge amount and we decide not to rebuild for some reason, we could easily afford to refinance into a higher rate loan.  In the meantime, paying a much cheaper note means that I am able to create significant additional savings, which go towards either building the home we actually want (on this lot), or paying down the principal should we decide to refi.\n\nThe two keys to an ARM being appropriate are: 1) the time period of the fixed portion of the loan is in-line with proper planning, and 2) you use the ARM to lower your monthly obligation (e.g.- keep liquidity), rather than to \"afford more house\" (e.g.- over-extend yourself should things go wrong).", "id": "d7tkhmh"}, {"comment": "They're typically used when the homeowner doesn't plan on owning the home for the length of the initial rate period.

So all of a sudden you have a huge influx of new buyers into a market that traditionally has been pretty steady.  What happens when demand goes up?  Prices go up!  What happens when people with bad credit get loans?  They don't pay them.  Everyone got caught up in the party and everyone bought overpriced homes and when the bad credit peopled stopped paying and the people that bought two homes stopped paying, prices came crashing and everyone was caught holding these overpriced assets.  \n\nThe kicker is that so many homeowners could still afford to make the payments but stopped because of laws that were passed by the Bush administration to help people in this situation.  Short sales became popular b/c people no longer would get a 1099 on the bad debt that the banks had to write off.  If Bush wouldn't have passed those laws, that 200K loss the bank took would normally be counted as income for you and at 30%, that's a 60K tax bill. \n\nI'm not giving the banks a free pass at all, but they take way more blame than they should.  \n\nApproximate Blame Assignment\n\n20% - Retail Banks / Mortgage Companies for pushing loans to people that couldn't afford them.  Sales people were making huge commission checks and so was everyone all the way up to the top.

At the end of the day though, if people would have paid their bills (the ones they agreed to pay), those securities would have been perfectly fine investments.  They didn't create those with the intentions of defrauding people.  They just realized that shit was about to hit the fan way before everyone else did because that is what they do.  They are smart with financial topics.\n\n20% Media for adding fuel to the fire about prices going up up up and all the money people were making flipping etc.  TV shows about flipping\n\n20% The homebuyers - People buying huge houses they couldn't afford, buying multiple houses, refinancing and just pulling all of the money out to buy cars, boats, vacations etc.\n\n20% Real Estate Agents - Similar to the media, encouraging people to take these risks so they can line their own pockets as well.\n\nBottom line is every group I listed above was greedy and did what they did because they wanted easy money.

Rape can be used decently in film, such as High Plains Drifter, where its used to shocking effect - our hero isn't actually a hero, he's just doing this for his own gain and private agenda. He's punishing the townsfolk for their past sins and deeds, which is a theme that the entire movie is based around. It's not just a throw-away scene.

She is also a threat to his way of life, his career - it's bad enough destroying things which look like humans for a living, things which it now appears may be developing real emotions, but what if they don't even know they're replicants?\n\nHe knows that Rachel is responding to him as a man (\"Is this testing whether I'm a replicant, or a lesbian?\" \"What if I go north? Would you come after me?\") and he's confused because he's responding to her as a woman - when he knows she's a replicant. There aren't any rules about this. We don't know whether the 'pleasure models' are for the pleasure of humans, or the other replicants. Maybe some people know how to deal with falling in love with a replicant, but Deckard doesn't.\n\nIf you remember the scene in full, they're at the piano.

She wants him, but she too is uncertain of the rules - are replicants allowed to do this? Is *she* allowed to do this? (Tyrell's not dead at this point, I think, or if he is, she doesn't know. He is literally her godhead - \"Not an easy thing, to meet your maker!\" - even though she's only just found that out, and who knows what he might do. Presumably he could just terminate her existence.)\n\nThis is a typically complicated relationship in a grown-up movie, and to reduce it to the sort of polarised analysis I'd expect from an SJW is fatuous. To call it 'rape', or compare it with what the stranger does in *High Plains Drifter* is bizarre. \n\nAfter Batty times out (\"You've done a man's job, sir!\") Deckard risks his life to go back and get Rachel, and take her to safety.

This is not always resolved by not having sex. Some couples might resolve it rather more physically, for others that would be completely unacceptable.\n\nI wasn't, BTW, comparing anyone to a SJW.

Sheila Benson from the Los Angeles Times called it \"Blade Crawler,\" and Pat Berman in The State and Columbia Record described it as \"science fiction pornography\".

Blade Runner is one of those films that has a number of different cuts made of it, some that completely change the tone of the movie. The most common complaint that I've heard has to do with Harrison Ford's narration in the Theatrical Cut, which if I remember correctly was a choice forced upon the film makers by the the studio. The narration itself is delivered poorly (some have accused Ford of sounding half asleep or drugged) and removes some of the wonderful ambiguity that the production design worked to instill the world of the film with. The common consensus seems to be that The Final Cut is the superior version of the film to see, followed by the Director's Cut, and the Theatrical Cut as a last resort. There are 4 additional cuts of the film in existence with minor variations upon the big 3 already mentioned. For what it's worth, if the netflix version is indeed the Theatrical Cut, I would recommend laying your hands on a Blu Ray copy of the The Final Cut and watching that first. It is the version that is closest to Ridley Scott's intended vision for the film, and I believe the Blu Ray includes several different versions of the film in addition to the aforementioned final cut.

Critics praised the show's brisk and witty nature, succinct dialogue, and riveting combination of espionage and crime drama presented in a charmingly irreverent tone. Donovan's performance as the lead character also received praise for his likeably lighthearted, smart-mouthed, and vengeful spirit. Burn Notice has also been praised for its strong supporting cast members, slick production values, intriguing narrative, and dry comedic humor.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22Burn+Notice%22+%282007%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Burn%20Notice), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com//m/02rktkj), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/burn-notice/season-2), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70143810), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q682825).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4tl9kc \"Confidence: 0.95\").

The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Full Metal Jacket garnered critical acclaim following its release. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected reviews to give the film a score of 95% based on reviews from 73 critics, with an average rating of 8\\.4 out of 10\\. Another aggregator Metacritic gave it a score of 78 out of 100, which indicates a \"generally favorable\" response, based on 18 reviews. Reviewers generally reacted favorably to the cast, Ermey in particular, and the film's first act in recruit training, but several reviews were critical of the latter part of the film set in Vietnam and what was considered a \"muddled\" moral message in the finale.

The song also played twice in the original show, with the second \"goodbye verse,\" being played at the end of the show. [Which is why it's played at the end of FMJ.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5WXVQOQ3ZI)\n\nThe song came out in the post-war year of 1955, and definitely had a military-esque cadence to it. It was written and sung by Jimmie Dodd in the show, who was also in the war-propaganda film [*Flying Tigers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Tigers_(film) with John Wayne. The [lyrics to the Mickey Mouse Club March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn4zO6JfPo) are also interesting:\n\n\"Forever man has held a banner.

Which is matched up in the original song as the cartoon characters march atop the globe.\n\n\"See you real soon\" (from the end song) - is also interesting. Kubrick knew that the US military wouldn't be ending it's foreign campaigns any time soon. By the time FMJ came out, [the US had already been involved in the affairs of several additional countries,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_military_operations#1970.E2.80.931979) including Vietnam, Cambodia, Zaire (Congo), Sinai, El Salvador, Libya, Lebanon, Egypt, Grenada, Honduras, Chad, Persian Gulf, and Bolivia.\n\nI think Kubrick is showing us how the military can be an insidious influence on multiple layers of culture, which in turn breeds more militarism (unless we decide to put an end to it).", "id": "czl2dba"}, {"comment": "So in other words, the duality of man.

Anthony Burgess hated Kubrick for omitting the final chapter from his book.  And I don't blame him since I myself have been the subject of the 21st Chapter.  Here is more from Wiki:  The book has three parts, each with seven chapters. Burgess has stated that the total of 21 chapters was an intentional nod to the age of 21 being recognised as a milestone in human maturation. The 21st chapter was omitted from the editions published in the United States prior to 1986.[7] In the introduction to the updated American text (these newer editions include the missing 21st chapter), Burgess explains that when he first brought the book to an American publisher, he was told that U.S. audiences would never go for the final chapter, in which Alex sees the error of his ways, decides he has lost all energy for and thrill from violence and resolves to turn his life around (a slow-ripening but classic moment of metanoia\u2014the moment at which one's protagonist realises that everything he thought he knew was wrong).\n\nAt the American publisher's insistence, Burgess allowed their editors to cut the redeeming final chapter from the U.S. version, so that the tale would end on a darker note, with Alex succumbing to his violent, reckless nature\u2014an ending which the publisher insisted would be \"more realistic\" and appealing to a U.S. audience. The film adaptation, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is based on the American edition of the book (which Burgess considered to be \"badly flawed\"). Kubrick called Chapter 21 \"an extra chapter\" and claimed[8] that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, and that he had never given serious consideration to using it. In Kubrick's opinion, the final chapter was unconvincing and inconsistent with the book.", "id": "czkszd4"}, {"comment": "I can't believe I didn't know this. *A Clockwork Orange* is one of my favorite books and I've read it at least five times.

So, by taking away Alex's right to choose for himself, they've taken away his ability to be a human being.

It's just too much to take in with just one viewing. I've seen Moonrise Kingdom about 5 times, and The Royal Tenenbaums more like 14 times (can you tell it's my favorite?). Every time I watch them, I STILL notice things that I hadn't seen before.\n\nI love the scene in Moonrise Kingdom when the other wilderness scouts accidentally shoot the dog with an arrow, and as Sam looks at the dog, Suzy asks \"Was he a good dog?\" and Sam makes this contemplative sigh and says \"Who's to say?\" It's so absurdly philosophical and serious that it makes me laugh every time.\n\nI also think Moonrise Kingdom does a really good job exhibiting all the flaws of the adults - of alluding to their disappointments, hopes, and intangible feelings towards life. Like that scene where Frances McDormand and Bill Murray are lying in their separate beds, and she apologizes to him. After a while, he just says \"I hope the roof flies off and I get sucked up into space.\" It's awfully sad, but also really melodramatic. I think it plays on some of the deepest, darkest parts of ourselves -- parts that we would rather not think too much about.

Is the sniper any more or less moral than the soldiers? Did she experience a similar training regimen that stripped her of her ideological reasons for subsuming her human empathy or was she killing for the reason she first took up a gun. From an American perspective, should we care that she manages to kill a few Marines or should we accept that AD the statistical outcome of what we saw in the first part of the movie: humans reduced to a numbers game? And is our visceral reaction to those deaths, of people we don't (or shouldn't) even really like (we see Animal's character early on and are exposed to it throughout the film; this is not someone we'd be happy our sister was dating) an explanation of how the American public reacted to a victory in the Tet Offensive? Is everyone who gets buried in a flag-draped casket a hero by virtue of their service? What if it's compelled? Or do we judge them instead by the content of their character?\n\nAnd then the final scene, which ought to haunt every citizen that sends our children to war without considering that they are, in fact, children sent to do an abhorrent task. Is it necessary? Was it worth their corruption? And what burden have we saddled them with? Could we carry it ourselves?

Reviewers generally reacted favorably to the cast, Ermey in particular, and the film's first act in recruit training, but several reviews were critical of the latter part of the film set in Vietnam and what was considered a \"muddled\" moral message in the finale.

Is the sniper any more or less moral than the soldiers?

With the help of Team America (Stone, Miller, Masasa, Parker, and Norris), Gary manages to slip into an arms dealer's hideout to uncover the plan to destroy the world. Will Team America be able to save the world?\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Team America\\: World Police has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Based on 194 reviews, the film received a 77% \"certified fresh\" rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus stating, \"Team America will either offend you or leave you in stitches. It'll probably do both.\" The film also holds a rating of 64 out of 100 at Metacritic, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson was supposed to have met Parker before production, but they cancelled the meeting, acknowledging he would not like the film's expletives. Anderson saw the completed film and felt \"there are good, fun parts \\[in the film\\] but the language wasn't to my liking.\" National Review Online has named the film \\#24 in its list of \"The Best Conservative Movies\". Brian C. Anderson wrote, \"the film's utter disgust with air-headed, left-wing celebrity activism remains unmatched in popular culture.\" However, political and social commentator Andrew Sullivan considers the film brilliant in its skewering of both the left and right's approach on terrorism. Sullivan (a fan of Stone and Parker's other work, as well) popularized the term \"South Park Republican\" to describe himself and other like-minded fiscal conservatives\\/social libertarians. Parker himself is a registered Libertarian. In August, Internet news aggregator Matt Drudge blasted Paramount and the filmmakers for trying to \"mock the terror war.\" A week later, the conservative group Move America Forward criticized the film, saying it was \"inconceivable\" that filmmakers would have spoofed the Nazis during World War II. In reality, many films mocking the Nazis were produced during the war, including Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, which was nominated for five Academy Awards. Before Team America was released, statements were released by a \"senior Bush administration official\" condemning the film. Upon receiving the news, the duo called and found it was instead a \"junior staffer,\" causing Stone to quip \"What is it \u2013 junior or senior? What are we talking about here? Who knows? It might have been the janitor.\" The two eventually decided it was free publicity, with which they were fine. Some media outlets interpreted the film's release on October 15 to be in theaters before the November elections. In reality, the release date had nothing to do with the elections; in fact, the film was intended to be released earlier, but production fell behind.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Team+America%3A+World+Police+%282004%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Team%20America%3A%20World%20Police), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/team_america_world_police/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/team-america-world-police), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70011195), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q907640).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4k468l \"Confidence: 1.07\").

Learning that power hungry dictator Kim Jong Il (Parker) is out to destroy the world, the team recuits Broadway star Gary Johnston (Parker) to go undercover. With the help of Team America (Stone, Miller, Masasa, Parker, and Norris), Gary manages to slip into an arms dealer's hideout to uncover the plan to destroy the world. Will Team America be able to save the world?\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Team America\\: World Police has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Based on 194 reviews, the film received a 77% \"certified fresh\" rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with the consensus stating, \"Team America will either offend you or leave you in stitches. It'll probably do both.\" The film also holds a rating of 64 out of 100 at Metacritic, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson was supposed to have met Parker before production, but they cancelled the meeting, acknowledging he would not like the film's expletives. Anderson saw the completed film and felt \"there are good, fun parts \\[in the film\\] but the language wasn't to my liking.\" National Review Online has named the film \\#24 in its list of \"The Best Conservative Movies\". Brian C. Anderson wrote, \"the film's utter disgust with air-headed, left-wing celebrity activism remains unmatched in popular culture.\" However, political and social commentator Andrew Sullivan considers the film brilliant in its skewering of both the left and right's approach on terrorism. Sullivan (a fan of Stone and Parker's other work, as well) popularized the term \"South Park Republican\" to describe himself and other like-minded fiscal conservatives\\/social libertarians. Parker himself is a registered Libertarian. In August, Internet news aggregator Matt Drudge blasted Paramount and the filmmakers for trying to \"mock the terror war.\" A week later, the conservative group Move America Forward criticized the film, saying it was \"inconceivable\" that filmmakers would have spoofed the Nazis during World War II. In reality, many films mocking the Nazis were produced during the war, including Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, which was nominated for five Academy Awards. Before Team America was released, statements were released by a \"senior Bush administration official\" condemning the film. Upon receiving the news, the duo called and found it was instead a \"junior staffer,\" causing Stone to quip \"What is it \u2013 junior or senior? What are we talking about here? Who knows? It might have been the janitor.\" The two eventually decided it was free publicity, with which they were fine. Some media outlets interpreted the film's release on October 15 to be in theaters before the November elections. In reality, the release date had nothing to do with the elections; in fact, the film was intended to be released earlier, but production fell behind.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Team+America%3A+World+Police+%282004%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Team%20America%3A%20World%20Police), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/team_america_world_police/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/team-america-world-police), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70011195), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q907640).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4k468l \"Confidence: 1.07\").

The series ran on the ABC network from March 18, 2009 to January 26, 2010\\.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Critics have praised Better Off Ted's witty and satirical humour, as well as its cast. According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the show's first season holds a score of 68 out of 100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 21 reviews. Misha Davenport of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote favorably of the show, comparing its characters to those of the highly acclaimed show Arrested Development. Linda Stasi of the New York Post gave the show three-and-a-half out of four stars, lauding the cast and simply referring to it as \"a very funny comedy\". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B\\+, stating \"'Better Off Ted' is certainly the most original sitcom to come along in a while.\" Robert Bianco from USA Today referred to the show as \"well-cast and reasonably entertaining.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22Better+Off+Ted%22+%282009%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Better%20Off%20Ted), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com//m/04jj3hb), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/better-off-ted/season-2), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q832431).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F52ffdv \"Confidence: 0.91\").

In the comics hellboy deals with a lot of situations but roughly speaking there's two big antagonistic factions.\n\nThere's various occultists that are bend on releasing some kind of elder god type creature from a dimensional prison. Doing so would herald in the end times. These are the guys that include the clockwork nazi, Rasputin (yeah *the* Rasputin) and a bunch of others that didn't make it into the movies like some kind of nazi scientist with a penchant for creating cyborg gorillas.\n\nThe second big faction are the fables and fairytales. These are basically all the mythical creatures that have been pushed into the margins by the rise of humanity. Think Oberyn's court, elves, goblins, trolls, fauns, satyrs, giants. But also those of other nations, Baba Yaga the Russian witch is a big player. The elven princes and kings are players. Some are content to fade into the shadows while others are bent on bringing about humanity's destruction so that the fables can rise again.\n\nThe first movie took a lot of elements from the stories revolving around the first faction while the second movie took a lot of elements from stories revolving around the second faction.\n\nWhat surprised me most about the comics is that about halfway through the books, Hellboy leaves the B.P.R.D. (Bueau for Paranormal Research and Defense) because he's sick of the way they treat him and other supernatural members of the team. At that point the comics split into a series featuring hellboy going solo to figure out his destiny. And the B.P.R.D. series which is the remaining team members (like Abe and Liz from the movies and a bunch that didn't make the movies) and the agency itself dealing with another apocalyptic storyline.\n\nI actually enjoyed the B.P.R.D. comics even more than Hellboy proper.", "id": "d1f1m8a"}, {"comment": "Nice summary...

BPRD works far more like a team of supernatural x-files agents that call in choppers full of commando teams or even the armed forces when it's time to go balls to the walls.\n\nPlus a lot of the BPRD team members are a lot more flawed than hellboy is. Liz can nuke a neighbourhood with her pyromancy powers but that's also her problem.\n\nRoger is a hulking humonculus but he's as innocent and impressionable as a child. So when undead marine captain Ben Daimo joins the team Roger takes him on as a role model and starts acting like a little boy pretending to be hard ass marine, cigar chewing and all.\n\nAlong with a bunch of human colleagues with paranormal specialties they're leading the agency in a war against mysterious frog mutants that keep popping up in greater army like numbers and are supposedly the precursor to an apocalypse event involving an elder god.", "id": "d1f9896"}, {"comment": "Hadn't thought of that, but it makes sense.", "id": "d1ey8wq"}, {"comment": "I actually enjoy the second more than the first.

I think it's a better balance of occult influences, action, and reality. It holds up to basically every superhero made thus far, but has a unique flavor of blending actual history into a fantastic setting. It presents fantasy, horror, and action in equal parts and in a way that seems natural.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIn contrast, the second is almost 100% fantasy. It drops the occult undertones of the first in favor of a more imaginary, almost dream-like setting. As several people have mentioned, it shares more with the dream/fantasy settings of Pan's Labyrinth than modern times. While this isn't a bad thing, it's not really what I wanted from a sequel and also seems to lack the balanced character progression of the first film.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIn particular, I feel like the second film drops the character motivations of the first. The  character setup and \"racking of pins\" in the first movie is basically forgotten for the sequel. The most interesting parts of Hellboy's history and destiny are ignored for the sequel. Even Liz just seems like part of the team, and the status quo is \"we do this all the time\". Parts of it seem a little off, and the ending actually reminds me of Indiana Jones 4, which can't be positive.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMy post is probably a bit negative up until this point so you may be wondering, why should I watch this at all? The answer is the insanely detailed and impressive world building. There is so much texture shoved into this film that it feels like it is bursting. The now famous Troll Market scene probably has more creativity than several other superhero films put together. If you have seen Pan's Labyrinth, it's like the last few minutes writ large. It's backed by a superhero/action movie budget, probably larger than the first, and it uses it well. There is really no superhero movie like it, and nothing now nor in the foreseeable future shares its fantastical and interesting vision.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo you should definitely see the sequel. To be honest, it almost doesn't feel like a sequel to the first, but it's so good and interesting in it's own way that it deserves a viewing.

However, much of the tension and drama of the film come from the angle that the protagonist can only *suspect* what is happening, as every accusation is met with reasonable and almost vindicating explanations. One big example was that his most damming accusation about the missing guest is completely debunked in a big way at such a crucial time. Every opportunity to leave the situation in a civil manner is met with equally civil hindrances. He (along with the audience) *suspects* malevolent intentions from the very beginning, but there is never any truly compelling evidence that would justify an abrupt and forceful exit. So we (along with Will) *feel* like something is very wrong, but don't truly **know** as all evidence shown to us is very directly confronted and countered. So to absolutely know ahead of time the intentions of the hosts leaves no room for doubt and puts you out of sync with the protagonist, making the film much less absorbing.

Everyone thought that he was crazy when he hit a girl-host, who went unconscious. \n\nHe missed one, a woman-guess drank the wine and immediately died with her mouth foaming.

Take it too literally it doesn't make as much sense. \n\nYou got people going about their daily grind to keep society running and themselves eating, they have access to trivial pleasures that they use to escape the monotony, *and they love to mock people worse off than themselves,* with zero sense of self-reflection. Aside from basic survival, they spend money both to avoid minor inconveniences (which are themselves monetary schemes, ads) and to acquire meaningless and worthless trinkets.\n\nMany dream of escaping the drudgery and becoming famous like big stars on TV (because the few 'real' stars love to display extravagant, fun and comfortable lifestyles) but in reality this is both a distraction AND just another way to separate them from their hard-earned money. Few people will ever 'break out' into fame and fortuen, in order to break out you have to bend over and allow yourself to be exploited and most of the time you will be used up and spit back out, not even managing to benefit from the experience.\n\nYour big dreams and goals don't matter, the things you take pleasure in can be taken from you and twisted, and throw back in your face... not from malice exactly but more from indifference. It takes an absurd amount of effort (and, by that, money) to even TRY to break out and if you fail you don't get any back, its gone and made someone else richer. Your control over your own destiny is really limited. \"Hard work\" will get you somewhere, but luck and, more importantly, connections to people with influence is what will actually help you win.\n\nAnd the big reveal is that the system is so smooth and effective that it takes its biggest critics and makes them part of the whole edifice. Rewards them and uses them as just one more monetized distraction.\n\nI think that was the one thing in there that really impressed me. It points out that a lot of the people who are 'famous' (in OUR world) for screaming about how backwards, corrupt, nonsensical, and/or disastrous society is (see: most political pundits) are actually wealthy themselves, profiting in large part *because* their diatribes capture an audience which they monetize to enrich themselves. \n\nAnd while they are ABSOLUTELY CORRECT that society is as messed up as they describe, they themselves aren't actually doing anything to change it (because hey, they're perfectly happy where they are) and most people don't care enough to even TRY and change it.\n \nEverything is about entertainment, because everybody just wants to escape the grind of their daily lives. Its easier and more pleasurable to have rebellious thoughts fed to you than to actually think about rebellion.\n\n*****\n\nSee, you could make the same point WITHOUT using a sci-fi dystopia, the episode just pumps it up to ridiculous levels so that it *gets through* and makes you actually think. \n\nOr not. If the episode is addressing a true problem, then its complicit in the system that it portrays.\n\nOR maybe the episode isn't really accurate and life is a lot better than it implies.

Like all dystopian sci-fi, its not meant to be realistic but actually entirely symbolic. The genre is a commentary on modern society through satire. This episode happened to be the most symbolic one. Its not even attempting to give answers which I think is probably intentional. The character in the story don't really get an understanding of their situation so neither do we. We only get to see and understand wbst \"they\" want us to see and understand.\n\nThe point was in its themes. Its not meant to paint what the future could realistically be but instead reflect our current reality. Thats why the show is called black mirror. \n\nI think it make sense you didn't like the episode. It was the least concerned with giving us context or answers and simply threw us in the middle of a story already underway.\n\nI thought the story was beautiful amd impactful and that its ambiguous nature made it a lot more powerful than episodes that were more concerned with spoonfeeding us the narrative.\n\nI still think youre compeltely missing the point of dystopian fiction though.

So many of the things that they presented as being Alan Turing original accomplishments weren't so at all -- and I say this with all of the respect in the world for Turing. He had many original accomplishments, they just didn't show you any of them. \n\nLike, the first half of the movie was all about how Alan Turing is this genius who wants to build a machine to crack Enigma codes, while his team rolls their eyes at him and wonders why he can't just crack codes by hand the old fashioned way like the rest of them. Ignoring the fact that the entire purpose of the team was to build a machine to break Enigma messages, and it wasn't a crazy idea because the Poles had already done it and smuggled the plans to them before the war, and before Germany modified Enigma a bit making the machine they built obsolete. \n\nOr the fact that Turing didn't build the machine either. \n\nOr the pivotal moment of the movie where Turing suddenly realizes how to break Enigma messages using the 'cillies' -- again something the Poles figured out and passed to the Brits. \n\nOr the fact that they suddenly cottoned on to the idea of taking guesses at what the plain text of the message might be to narrow down possible key choices. In crypto speak its called a crib, and they have been widely used in cryptanalysis for hundreds if not thousands of years. Don't get me wrong, cribs were important to breaking Enigma messages, but they were not an Alan Turing invention. \n\nOr immediately after breaking the message, Alan Turing realizes that they can't tell anyone what they have done or the Germans will know the cipher was broken and switch up. So apparently for the rest of the war they pull double duty figuring out what information can be released. For one thing, translating and prioritizing decrypts wasn't Hut 6's job, that was for Hut 3. For another, the need to maintain security over the decrypts in order to prevent the Germans from finding out it was broken was so obvious that I would bet that the very first time someone suggested breaking Enigma, it was followed up with '... But then we need to make sure we don't use the information too freely or the Germans will figure it out'. Everyone from the women working the telegrams up to Winston fucking Churchill would have known that. The fact that, in the movie, no one realized this until Turing said something is ridiculous.

The Washington Post gave the film a negative review, finding the script written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon as \"made only the sketchiest attempts to draw their historical characters. They exist as foils and nothing else, and the gags that are hung on them are far from first-rate\", and that if director \"Stephen Herek, has any talent for comedy, it's not visible here. More than anything, the picture looks paltry and undernourished.\" Variety wrote about each historical figure that Bill & Ted meet, stating that \"Each encounter is so brief and utterly cliched that history has little chance to contribute anything to this pic\u2019s two dimensions.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times referred to the film as a \"painfully inept comedy\" and that the \"one dimly interesting thing about Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is the way the two teen-age heroes communicate in superlatives. We are about to fail most egregiously, says Ted to Bill, or maybe it's Bill to Ted.

Fire is fogo, \"you can\" is \"pode\". \"I want\" is \"eu quero\". Words that would have had a ll in Spanish become ch. So rain is chuvia. To arrive is chegar.  \n\nThen learn about the different in pronunciation. Double r is a h sound. They pronounce j like a j but then a d or t followed by an e or en i also sounds a bit like a soft j or g too. So pode sounds more like podgy. D\u00eda sounds like gia. \u00c7 sounds like an s and words ending in \u00e7\u00e3o are a slightly more nasally version of cion or zon.  \n\nNow you can start talking, using modified Spanish words if you don't know the Portuguese word and about 50% of the time, this will be the correct word and another 25% of the time they'll understand you. Beer is cerveja for example. Airport is aeroporto. Heart is cora\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nBrazilian Portuguese is even easier because they have a few less tenses and they don't use the informal second person, so you don't need to bother learning it. And you can get away with using \"a gente <third person singular>\" instead of the first person plural, so you don't need to bother with that either.

Think Vader in the first scene of Stat Wars or the antagonists of Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds.\n\nAlso by the Nth time they use sleeve derringers it just wasn't cool anymore.\n\nSome other thoughts:\n\nThe movie's acts seem hugely disconnected to me. There is nothing that binds the pre-Candyland scenes to the post-Candyland scenes in either plot or tone. The first act doesn't build up to the second act in any meaningful way. You don't see the main villain until halfway through the film; the kills that occur early on don't directly push Django towards his goals and are fairly arbitrary. Compare this to Kill Bill, where the Bride has specific people she wants to kill for a specific reason, all of whom are tied to the Big Bad.\n\nThe dentist character, I don't even remember his name, is just far too loony for me to care about or take seriously. I just don't recall anyone as wacky as this as a main character in another Tarantino film. He felt like a character out of Wild Wild West to me. \n\nSamuel L. Jackson did a good job in his role, but honestly I feel like he is kind of played out as an actor, basically he gets thrown into movies to be some kind of shock character. He always comes across to me as SLJ and not his character (Brad Pitt is starting to fall into this as well). I would've preferred to see some less known actor take on this role instead of hogging the spotlight for what is essentially a butler.\n\nJamie Foxx was great, no complaints there.

His killing spree is simultaneously monstrous (brutally murdering many) and very human (saving people he cares about). \n\nIt kind of reminds me of the alternate ending of I Am Legend, where the vampire zombies break into the lab only to take back the female that Will Smith had been experimenting on. In that moment, when they leave him alone and save their own, you see that these \"monsters\" were only trying to protect themselves from the menace they perceived Will Smith to be.

Lots of responses in this thread saying movies that are popular on reddit but really aren't much like Kubrick at all. \n\nIf anything defines Kubrick its his ability to traverse tons of different subject matter/styles, film techniques, and genres with an effortlessness that he makes seem natural (although was ofc the result of his extreme perfectionism). Unlike a director like David Lynch, who takes a lot of risks and can have missteps but always produces something wonderfully \"Lynchian\" and whose movies are instantly identifiable and have lots of recurring ideas and themes, Kubrick was notable for his willingness to do something different with each film and despite his technical flourishes and immaculate eye for detail (especially in his settings) the major thing that identifies Kubrick's best films is just how utterly perfect everything about them is.\n\nIt's really for that reason that he's the best director of all time. He could do almost any type of movie, but his best ones are all very different and yet each comes across basically as the idealized version of what a \"movie\" can be. Obviously you can find commonalities because it is the same director but it is just mind blowing how capable he was in so many different styles. \n\nPTA and the Coens, I'd say PTA moreso, are the same. PTA doesn't really have any distinguishing trait in his movies other than that they are clearly made by a genius/perfectionist and that is what most closely links him to Kubrick. Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood both hold their own with Kubrick's best films. ", "id": "cz04oh5"}, {"comment": "I'd put Fincher up there for meticulousness. If I\u00f1\u00e1rritu continues, he'll be in the convo with Kubrick for GOAT. ", "id": "cz08zfl"}, {"comment": "Yeah, Fincher is a masterful filmmaker for sure. Like musicians or novelists or anything when you're trying to sort out your GOAT there is obviously tons of competition. I expanded a bit in another comment to Eupatorus why I think Kubrick is, unquestionably (for me), the GOAT. Its partially how much of a master filmmaker he is, but like you said Fincher and many others have similar technical ability. Its partially his versatility, but many other directors have that too. Danny Boyle, Fincher....those guys are super versatile and have definitely made some \"perfect\" movies, they are incredible directors. \n\nInnarritu I think is one of the closest things we have to a Kubrick today, and if he maintains the consistency he's had already he'll be a huge name to remember. But for me, at least, his movies aren't as purely entertaining as Kubrick's, and like I said I just responded to another comment basically saying this but man, Kubrick just did it all so perfectly, he made movies that are as artistic as Tarkovsky but are so fucking entertaining too. They are heavy at times and sad at others but at the end of the day its mindblowing just how enthralling and fun every one of his films is. \n\nI think Paul Thomas Anderson is THE closest thing we have to a Kubrick, the consistency isn't quite there but everything else is. Boogie Nights especially is a movie that is as deeply artistic, original, and perfect as anything else you'll ever see, but it is also so hilarious and entertaining. I think that is ultimately THE most difficult type of film to make, and can only be produced when genius and a sort of adolescent love meet each other, the guys who really \"worship\" film as an artistic medium. \n\nDirectors who have a really notable style are awesome too. David Lynch is probably my second favorite director. But what's always blown my mind about Kubrick is how his films are almost their own organic creations of themselves, I watch a Kubrick film and I would never change anything, everything in his movies is as its meant exactly to be.

I watched Birdman maybe a year ago and while I enjoyed it, I would probably still hold my statement that it wasn't as \"entertaining\" as a Kubrick film, that's not really a knock because it was an incredible character study but I just love how Kubrick can tell these timeless stories, stuff that feels, in a way, like it could be some ancient thing you've heard hundreds of times before but never in such a perfect telling. \n\nBirdman was, for me, a movie 100% concerned with the question of what is true art and what is an artist? nobody i watched it with had the same takeaway but the entire time all i could focus on was the questions Innaritu raised and played with over what is 'real' art. there is no question in my mind that he is an artist, the best kind. i think i enjoyed the movie much more on a critical level, discussing it and thinking about it, then i actually did watching it lol.

As you're watching it, no matter how involved in the film you are, it's hard to ever forget that you're watching Tarantino, especially now because his style has been so fleshed out. Innaritu I feel like is able to achieve that though, to make movies that don't feel like \"oh I'm watching the new Innaritu, here's some typical Innaritu dialogue.\" it's crazy not just how different Birdman and The Revenant are in terms of subject matter, but in the overall feel of the films. \n\nKubrick was able to do those high level artistic films but also made films that were not just enjoyable, but really truly entertaining a la Tarantino. Tarantino's films are such an event even though they'll have a misstep or two just because they are so damn entertaining. such a ride. it's not so much that Innaritu drags, but that Kubrick flies by, and hits these sort of rollicking fun entertainment highs that I'd associate with popcorn munching mainstream cinema, and in many ways that is what i find so remarkable about his films, especially Barry Lyndon. ", "id": "cz230la"}, {"comment": "While I mostly agree with your comment, I guess I was referring to \"Kubrickian\" mostly as a cinematic style. His use of lighting and color, and even moreso framing. Kubrick had a way of framing scenes like they were paintings come to life. Static shots with well choreographed action. Often it's almost ghostly, for lack of better term (haunting?).\n\nAnyway, he was a master and possibly the best yet in many ways.", "id": "cz0942x"}, {"comment": "That's definitely accurate, especially in The Shining and Barry Lyndon (which was meant to look like an old painting), and it certainly highlights one of the consistencies in Kubrick's style, but what I think is interesting is how hard to it is to really define his overall style on top of that, at least for me, as anything other than \"genius.\" \n\nLike Wes Anderson's later films follow the same trend, the character's don't feel so much like ghosts as some sort of melancholy daydream but still you look at a film like Grand Budapest or Darjeeling Limited and every scene is has the feeling of being an ultra detailed painting. \n\nBut when you think of a Wes Anderson movie you don't think of that really being the defining trait of his directing style, although the lushness of his scenes and worlds may flash in your head. Instead, we associate Wes Anderson with the quirkiness and everyday longings that have defined most of his films, the stuff that's already there in Bottle Rocket before his technical abilities had caught up to the originality of his style. And to get to the heart of either director's style you'd need to do at least an essay on it, obviously, but its pretty easy to instantly recognize a Lynch or a Wes Anderson or a Scorsese film even, whereas Kubrick just had such versatility and talent that, at least for me, the only true consistency in his style is this sort of genius level of perfectionism. And for that reason they feel like paintings, they feel like novels (not just the ones based on novels, and even those feel like their own type of separate novel) they feel like deep meditations on our own humanity while also being- and here's the really amazing thing- so damn entertaining. His films flow by with the pacing and fullness of a great symphony. \n\nIt's easy to watch Kubrick and shove popcorn in your mouth. Like Tarantino, you can really feel the love of cinema pulsing beneath the movie, but unlike Tarantino Kubrick's fingerprints are never all over it. Instead, Kubrick's presence is always there, but its so subtle, so brilliant. And that to me, honestly, is what I find so striking about his films, I'd like to think we could see one of his films and know innately it is Kubrick but it is hard to pin down exactly what reveals that. In my eyes, at least, he has a true talent for letting the moment live and breathe as its own entity even though (being such a perfectionist) his fingerprints are all over the film.\n\nI think there is such a reverence for film there that allows him simultaneously be the center of the film but also let it exist as its own entity, a convergence of his influence and the source material and the actors. Another commenter mentioned Innaritu and I definitely think he's one of the directors who is really like Kubrick today in terms of versatility, remarkable consistency, and the ability to let his films- when you watch them- exist on their own terms despite being such a control freak. However, the one area I don't find Innaritu as effective is that his films just aren't quite as purely entertaining as Kubrick's. That might seem like a silly thing to say because all movies are supposed to be entertaining in a sense but man you watch Barry Lyndon and those three hours just fly by. There's this boyish gleefulness at the heart of every Kubrick because even though the guy was a genius and an artist and the best filmmaker of all time at the heart of all his films you can still almost feel the little kid in every one of us who just wants to see a movie and be taken on a ride. \n\nedit: I also was mainly responding to the people saying that Ex Machina, Sunshine, It Follows, The Babadook, Under the Skin, and Ti West all have Kubrickian influence, just to clarify, although obviously I love to discuss Kubrick. Those are all movies I've seen hyped a lot on reddit (with the exception of Ti West who is solid but I don't think deserves a ton of hype, The Sacrament was pretty fucking bad) and none of them are very similar to Kubrick at all save for maybe having some shards of the massive influence he cast down on all movies that came after him.

Also both directors prefer widescreen in their movies and use it most of the time.

Chuck would seem to have pretty good potential for a spin off movie.  It has a built in fanbase, and as far as I know none of the main character's actors/actresses are doing much.  Also, being a movie, I think it could finally get a singular cohesive story line and wrap itself up nicely.  Also, the show seemed to be fairly low budget (or at least not big-budget), and a movie might be able to deploy a bit more \"oomph\".

To me, the entire movie is set so deep in a racist system that you don't even see the white people. I thought that was a major theme of the film. Main character is given one option for getting into a \"successful\" economic class, and finds out that it's just another method of making money for the class of people he thinks he's getting into.\n\nThere was that whole moment where he's meeting with the big boss, and he discovers that the older drug dealer was in his exact position having Harvard dangled over his head, being told he was going to become a part of \"successful\" America.\n\n", "id": "czvhxq2"}, {"comment": "I saw the movie in the theater a while ago so my memory may be hazy but I got the impression that it was the bank guy creating his own version of the racket he was victim to rather than him being a cog in some insidious system created by the man against black people.

Only the banker has managed to \"get out,\" but whether or not he's not really \"out\" is arguable, and he makes his living off of the fiction that he's helping others get \"out\".\n\nThroughout the movie, Harvard acts as a promised land. There are characters who say they've been there, and assure everyone that it's out there, but throughout the movie its existence is thrown into question, and it becomes a point of disillusionment for the main character. He is shown that being good was never going to be rewarded, and that his only real options involve evil.\n\nI actually see this as a central theme to the film. Our character is trying to get to a place where hard work is rewarded and evil is punished, but the environment he lives in is so broken that he can't find it.\n\nEveryone is right, he does some bad things that are never punished.

The housing bubble was a HUGE topic of discussion.  While the federal reserve dismissed that the bubble existed (and many mainstream economists followed suit), many others economists, notably Dean Baker, were screaming at the top of their lungs about the housing bubble and practically crying for the Fed to acknowledge its existence to deflate it, instead of it having it burst explosively.

Had S&P and Moody's never deviated from their rating methodology then more likely than not, pretty much all CLOs would have been properly rated and therefore been priced accordingly.\n\nSome of these CLOs would not sell and then there would be a trickle down effect where if shit CLOs couldn't sell them banks would stop buying mortgages to securitize them and then smaller banks would stop giving mortgages to shitty credits.

The banks and the rating agencies are competing for the same quantitative analysts.  But the banks pay more and are more exciting, so the rating agencies get the dreck.\n2. The banks make the crap look a lot better using math.  In particular, the real flawed assumption of CDOs was that the payback/failure of each individual mortgage was an independent event.\n3. If you've ever read an academic paper by people who are smarter than you, you will find that it is very hard not to just gloss over the details that you don't fully understand and \"trust the author\".  Because of the effects of (1) and (2), the rating agencies were simply not equipped to handle the complicated contracts they were being asked to rate.\n\nIf the mortgage market truly was full of independent events, you really could make shit into gold, as you can charge people with poor credit higher interest rates to make up for the chance of failure.  Unfortunately, they are not independent events, and the players in the movie become acutely aware of this.  When some people start failing to make their mortgages, it affects the economy around them and makes the other mortgages more likely to fail.

Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker praised the show, calling it \"not merely the best sitcom on television but one of the most arresting and ambitious current TV series, period.\" Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the first season negatively, commenting \"it is smug enough to think it's breaking ground, but not smart enough to know it isn't.\" Brian Lowry of Variety gave the first season a positive review, saying it was \"invariably clever and occasionally a laugh-out-loud riot, all while lampooning taboo topics\". Later seasons of the show have received favorable ratings on review aggregator Metacritic, receiving 70\\/100, 78\\/100 and 85\\/100 for seasons 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The show has become a cult hit with viewers and is often compared in style to Seinfeld\u2014particularly due to the self-centered nature of its main characters. The Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer Jonathan Storm wrote \"It's like Seinfeld on crack,\" a quote that became extremely widely used to describe the series, to the point that FX attached the tagline, \"It's Seinfeld on crack.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Awards:** 1 wins and 8 nominations\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22It%27s+Always+Sunny+in+Philadelphia%22+%282005%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2434796), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia/), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/en/its_always_sunny_in_philadelphia).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F3zk0fc \"Confidence: 0.99\").

Unfortunately, their warped views and precarious judgments often lead them to trouble, creating myriad uncomfortable situations that usually only get worse before they get better.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has received largely positive reviews from critics. Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker praised the show, calling it \"not merely the best sitcom on television but one of the most arresting and ambitious current TV series, period.\" Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly reviewed the first season negatively, commenting \"it is smug enough to think it's breaking ground, but not smart enough to know it isn't.\" Brian Lowry of Variety gave the first season a positive review, saying it was \"invariably clever and occasionally a laugh-out-loud riot, all while lampooning taboo topics\". Later seasons of the show have received favorable ratings on review aggregator Metacritic, receiving 70\\/100, 78\\/100 and 85\\/100 for seasons 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The show has become a cult hit with viewers and is often compared in style to Seinfeld\u2014particularly due to the self-centered nature of its main characters. The Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer Jonathan Storm wrote \"It's like Seinfeld on crack,\" a quote that became extremely widely used to describe the series, to the point that FX attached the tagline, \"It's Seinfeld on crack.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Awards:** 1 wins and 8 nominations\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22It%27s+Always+Sunny+in+Philadelphia%22+%282005%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=2434796), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia/), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/en/its_always_sunny_in_philadelphia).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F3zk0fc \"Confidence: 0.99\").

Not having done any traveling, he enjoys living within the comforts of what he knows, basically that being what is purely British. As such, his friends, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, decide to send Karl to various parts of the world to experience unfamiliar cultures. Stephen believes that travel is a life broadening venture, and hopes that Karl will indeed feel like his life is enriched by these travels. Ricky, however, hopes that Karl will hate every minute of his travels. For Ricky, this experiment is the most expensive gag for his own pleasure that he could have conceived.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> The show has received widespread acclaim. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter praised the show, saying\\: \"At times, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to fall apart laughing. An Idiot Abroad is ridiculously funny and even when it\u2019s clear that Gervais and Merchant \u2013 pulling the strings back home in England and communicating with Pilkington via cell phone (some of these exchanges are scripted and sound added post-production, since cell coverage is not available in remote areas) \u2013 are having a cruel laugh, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to fall apart laughing at poor Pilkington\u2019s fate.\" WhatCulture responded positively to the first series, saying\\: \"It\u2019s the funniest documentary I have ever seen and maybe even the best. I will say that An Idiot Abroad has the potential to be a very memorable TV travel series, packed full of humour, heart and unique insights into other cultures.\" TV Shows on DVD gave the first series a positive review, saying\\: \"I've been to places featured in three of the episodes, and it was a blast watching Karl experience them.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22An+Idiot+Abroad%22+%282010%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An%20Idiot%20Abroad), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com//m/0czbdn2), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3374761).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F578vx8 \"Confidence: 0.94\").

It's a pretty long standing tradition for comedians to put on a role like this one.\n\nI find it a lot harder to believe that Gervais and Merchant, both people who seem to attract a number of friends in the industry who aren't known for cruelty, are really sadists who pick on a poor simpleton for money than that they all get along pretty well and are just in on the joke.  On top of that, Pilkington has spectacularly clever comedic timing and delivery (he was a writer on the Ricky Gervais show way back when, and a journalist before that).  He isn't an imbecile.  At most he's a homebody who doesn't like trying new things, but an idiot?  I find that really hard to believe.\n\nThat being said though, that's just my read on the show. Obviously if it seems genuinely mean to you, then I absolutely understand why you wouldn't like it.

Not having done any traveling, he enjoys living within the comforts of what he knows, basically that being what is purely British. As such, his friends, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, decide to send Karl to various parts of the world to experience unfamiliar cultures. Stephen believes that travel is a life broadening venture, and hopes that Karl will indeed feel like his life is enriched by these travels. Ricky, however, hopes that Karl will hate every minute of his travels. For Ricky, this experiment is the most expensive gag for his own pleasure that he could have conceived.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> The show has received widespread acclaim. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter praised the show, saying\\: \"At times, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to fall apart laughing. An Idiot Abroad is ridiculously funny and even when it\u2019s clear that Gervais and Merchant \u2013 pulling the strings back home in England and communicating with Pilkington via cell phone (some of these exchanges are scripted and sound added post-production, since cell coverage is not available in remote areas) \u2013 are having a cruel laugh, it\u2019s nearly impossible not to fall apart laughing at poor Pilkington\u2019s fate.\" WhatCulture responded positively to the first series, saying\\: \"It\u2019s the funniest documentary I have ever seen and maybe even the best. I will say that An Idiot Abroad has the potential to be a very memorable TV travel series, packed full of humour, heart and unique insights into other cultures.\" TV Shows on DVD gave the first series a positive review, saying\\: \"I've been to places featured in three of the episodes, and it was a blast watching Karl experience them.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22An+Idiot+Abroad%22+%282010%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=An%20Idiot%20Abroad), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com//m/0czbdn2), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3374761).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F578vx8 \"Confidence: 0.94\").

The series follows the misadventures of alcoholic scientist Rick and his easily influenced grandson Morty, who split their time between domestic family life and interdimensional travel. Roiland voices the series' eponymous characters, while the series also stars the voice talent of Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer, and Sarah Chalke. The series has its origins in an animated parody of Back to the Future created by Roiland for film festival Channel 101\\. Adult Swim approached Harmon for television show ideas, and he and Roiland developed the program based on the short's two characters.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> The series received critical acclaim and currently holds a 100% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Additionally, the first season of Rick and Morty holds a Metacritic score of 85 based on eight reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". David Weigand of San Francisco Chronicle described it as \"offbeat and occasionally coarse... the take-away here is that it works.\" He praised the animation direction by James McDermott for being \"fresh, colorful and as wacky as the script\", and states that the series possesses \"shades of Futurama, South Park and even Beetlejuice\", ultimately opining that its humor felt \"entirely original.\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times praised the series and stated that it was \"Grandparenting at its unhinged finest.\" Todd Spangler of Variety gave the series a lukewarm review; while he found the series was passable, he contrasted it with other Adult Swim series as \"often seems overly reliant on simply being frenetic at the expense of being witty\" and enjoyed it as \"a welcome attempt to dream just a little bigger.\" David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the series an \"A-\". In reviewing the first two episodes, he complimented the animation for its \"clean, simple style.\" He stated that while the series has \"a dark, sick sensibility,\" he praised its \"effort to give each character a little bit of depth,\" further applauding Roiland's voice talent for the eponymous characters.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22Rick+and+Morty%22+%282013%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rick%20and%20Morty), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/rick-morty), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15659308).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4eoal5 \"Confidence: 0.95\").

Awhile ago I wrote up an explanation in r/rickandmorty about why. But basically it boils down to this:\n\nRick and Morty is normally a smart, funny, witty show that has layers of comedy. It has the comedy for the lowest common denominator such as fart jokes and stuff like that, but then it is also an extremely smart show that tackles social issues and real world problems disguised as a cartoon. I would compare it to something like south park.\n\nWhereas that episode is more like an episode of Family guy. Basically all just random jokes that appeal to the lowest common denominator.\n\nAgain that is just my take on it, and I enjoy family guy but I just didn't think that episode was on par with the subtle humor and smart plotlines of the rest of the episodes.\n\nEdit: my old review of that episode:   https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/3lq6td/slug/cv8lxmy", "id": "d22xmyn"}, {"comment": "I don't know why it reminds you of Family Guy.

I'd have a problem with the TV setup too but it was unique to that episode* and it ended up working really well for the short duration it's in play.\n\nIt ends up tying into the main impact of the episode and B plot too, which from my memory tend to be pretty separate most of the time.\n\nIn short I think a big part of what made Rixty Minutes good for me was how it made itself stand out from the other season 1 episodes.\n\n*I realized they pulled the same concept in a season 2 episode.

The series follows the misadventures of alcoholic scientist Rick and his easily influenced grandson Morty, who split their time between domestic family life and interdimensional travel. Roiland voices the series' eponymous characters, while the series also stars the voice talent of Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer, and Sarah Chalke. The series has its origins in an animated parody of Back to the Future created by Roiland for film festival Channel 101\\. Adult Swim approached Harmon for television show ideas, and he and Roiland developed the program based on the short's two characters.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> The series received critical acclaim and currently holds a 100% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. Additionally, the first season of Rick and Morty holds a Metacritic score of 85 based on eight reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". David Weigand of San Francisco Chronicle described it as \"offbeat and occasionally coarse... the take-away here is that it works.\" He praised the animation direction by James McDermott for being \"fresh, colorful and as wacky as the script\", and states that the series possesses \"shades of Futurama, South Park and even Beetlejuice\", ultimately opining that its humor felt \"entirely original.\" Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times praised the series and stated that it was \"Grandparenting at its unhinged finest.\" Todd Spangler of Variety gave the series a lukewarm review; while he found the series was passable, he contrasted it with other Adult Swim series as \"often seems overly reliant on simply being frenetic at the expense of being witty\" and enjoyed it as \"a welcome attempt to dream just a little bigger.\" David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the series an \"A-\". In reviewing the first two episodes, he complimented the animation for its \"clean, simple style.\" He stated that while the series has \"a dark, sick sensibility,\" he praised its \"effort to give each character a little bit of depth,\" further applauding Roiland's voice talent for the eponymous characters.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?%22Rick+and+Morty%22+%282013%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rick%20and%20Morty), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/tv/rick-morty), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15659308).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4eoal5 \"Confidence: 0.95\").

Nearly ten years on though, those same rights holders have realized just how valuable their old titles still are. Thus, they'll ask for more cash. On top of that, many of those rights holders are also attempting to launch their own streaming services, which leads to them wanting to hold on to their material for the sake of exclusivity.\n\nIt seems people didn't realize that Netflix is a business, not a pro bono publica timewaster. Now that Netflix is reaching market saturation, they have two options: Stick with the same business model and jack-up prices to keep up with the prices movie and tv studios are demanding, or raise prices incrementally and produce more content which will never expire on them, thus permanently inflating their library.

Nearly ten years on though, those same rights holders have realized just how valuable their old titles still are. Thus, they'll ask for more cash.

A large majority of these scripts will never be looked at yet studios keep amassing them with good reason.  \n\nImagine there are two studios, Studio A and Studio B. Studio B decides to release a movie about pets and what they do when humans are away. They start building a production team, auditioning voice actors, visiting possible set locations, and doing a fuck ton else that happens before a second of film is shot. While this is going on, Studio A through various channels gets word of the plans Studio B has and needs to make a choice;  they can sit back and let Studio B release the movie (gain all revenue) OR they can go through their script bank to find something that can compete with Studio B's offering. \n\nStudios more often than not decide to go ahead and find that competing script then hurry it to ideally release it before their competitors. In the scenario I setup, studio A would do all of can to get its offering released before studio Bs. The mindset being that B will put out a better movie as they've spent more time on it and are not just being reactionary so it is in A's benefit to be  \"first to Market\". \n\nTLDR; Studios find out what each other are doing and decide if they should release a competing movie. \n", "id": "dam27b3"}, {"comment": "Thanks for the thoughtful reply.

The film is a visual insult.\" On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says \"it's not hard to see why,\" as well as criticising Portman's performance\\: \"Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance.\" Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RT\u00c9 states the film \"works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any\\/all of the three\". He added that the film will become \"a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age.\" Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is \"a bit of a mess... it rarely thrills or engages as a story.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Awards:** 4 wins and 15 nominations\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?V+for+Vendetta+%282005%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1891886), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/v_for_vendetta/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/v-for-vendetta), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70039175), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/en/v_for_vendetta_2006).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4d1mim \"Confidence: 1.12\").

Yet another graphic novel has been bulldozed on to the screen, strutting its stuff for an assumed army of uncritical geeks - a fanbase product from which the fanbase has been amputated. This film manages to be, at all times, weird and bizarre and baffling, but in a completely boring way. Watching it is like having the oxygen supply to your brain slowly starved over more than two hours. The script is by the Wachowski brothers, based on the original comic-book creation by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, and James McTeigue directs - graduating to his first feature after assisting on the Matrix sequels.\n\n>Imagine, if you will, the Britain of some 20 years hence as a kind of retro-futurist Orwellian police state with tatty, Blitz-era posters with creepy state slogans on decaying brick walls, but modern buildings like the Gherkin visible on the London skyline, and in which there are portraits of John Hurt everywhere as a gauntly bearded, Leninist Big Brother. You will have to imagine it pretty hard, because this movie has not imagined it, at least in no more than in an 1980s pop video way. The British people are living in a state of resentful oppression and dental disrepair: and they are represented in various scenes by about a dozen or so Equity members, quaintly shown at the pub or in their prole front rooms, glumly watching the state television network on which propaganda is pumped out.\n\n>There is, it seems, a lone terrorist-cum-revolutionary opposed to all this: a Scarlet Pimpernel figure whisking through the shadows, spouting rhetoric, and generally causing mayhem. His name is simply V, a man with a vendetta against tyranny and some personal grudges; he affects the cloak, hat and grinning mask of Guy Fawkes, the most famous conspirator in the 1605 Gunpowder Plot. The voice is by Hugo Weaving. V has a friend, ally and, who knows, perhaps even a beauty-and-the-beast-style love interest in a young woman called Evey - geddit? - a television researcher played by the reliably terrible Natalie Portman.\n\n>V is a mystery; he begins the film by blowing up London's central criminal court, the Old Bailey, with a firework display of explosives, accompanied by Tchaikovsky's 1812, which he has sneaked on to the police PA system - and he has more inspiring and, apparently, victimless crime-spectaculars in mind. How exactly V has managed to do this is a big mystery, the secret to which the film is uninterested in revealing. Pettifogging real-world considerations wouldn't matter, or matter as much, if the style and design were in any way witty or interesting. They sadly aren't, and McTeigue believes that by repeatedly showing people with shadows falling mysteriously across their faces he is reproducing the world of the comic book. V's fight scenes, featuring much oblique slashing with highly polished blades, are unexciting and unscary.\n\n>Portman for some reason has a thin, wittering South African accent as Evey, which may have been superior to other thin, wittering accents she tried out in rehearsal. There are a couple of London coppers played by Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves and in the course of apprehending a suspect Graves actually uses the word \"chummy\" - for which he deserved to have his collar felt by someone or other. John Hurt plays the sinister Chancellor figure, seen addressing his creepy cabinet of enforcers as a giant face on a screen, a hackneyed design tic that may be intended to recall his performance as Winston Smith in the movie version of 1984. Roger Allam plays a blustering, reactionary TV commentator who naturally turns out to be a former black-uniformed agent of the state.\n\n>None of these characters is convincing on any level, but interestingly something might have been made of the persona of Deitrich, the closet-gay TV host who employs Evey. He is played by Stephen Fry with an energy that hints that with a better written role, or really any sort of role at all, he could have raised this film's game a notch or two.\n\n>V For Vendetta is such an odd mixture: partly naive post-punk posturing, betraying the original's 1981 origins, and partly well-meant (but very American) condescension towards London and Britain. Like tourists with a phrasebook, the Wachowskis get people to say \"bollocks\" a fair bit, and there is a pastiche of The Benny Hill Show. On the higher end of the cultural scale, V declaims Shakespeare, and in honour of Guy Fawkes's subversion in the age of James I, reels off lots of Macbeth. But he fails to quote the only appropriate lines: the ones about it being a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/17/1"]], [[{"comment": "My favorite movie.

I also like discussing technology with friends, coworkers, online groups, etc.  \nIf I could not have those discussions I would get less total enjoyment out of my tech hobby (which I think is the point you're making), but I wouldn't enjoy working on computers any less (which is my point).  \n\nLet's use My Little Pony as the opposite example.  Obviously the stigma makes it hard for fans to publicly express their appreciation of the show.  Stupid, but meh.  \n\nYou say \"you can't mention that to people now because everybody thinks you're a horse-fucking deviant  ... [which] has effectively ruined My Little Pony for a lot fans\".  I'd accept that at face value as probably true.  I'd just ask why it has to 'ruin' the show.  And the answer (IMHO) is, 'because a lot of those people can't watch My Little Pony without feeling like they are engaging in a deviant activity when they watch (even in private)'.

Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta \"almost always has something going on that is actually interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will\". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a \"woeful, depressing failure\" and stating that the \"cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid the wreckage of the Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue.\" Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticizing the film's treatment of its political message as being \"fairly dim, adolescent stuff,\" as well as expressing dislike for the \"barely decorated sets with television-standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult.\" On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says \"it's not hard to see why,\" as well as criticising Portman's performance\\: \"Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance.\" Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RT\u00c9 states the film \"works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any\\/all of the three\". He added that the film will become \"a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age.\" Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is \"a bit of a mess... it rarely thrills or engages as a story.\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Awards:** 4 wins and 15 nominations\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?V+for+Vendetta+%282005%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1891886), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/v_for_vendetta/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/v-for-vendetta), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70039175), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/en/v_for_vendetta_2006).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4d1mim \"Confidence: 1.12\").

I hadn't read the graphic novel, but it's interesting to hear the differences.\n\nThat said, I think it sounds like the changes were overall a good thing.  That vid suggests the graphic novel had many more primary characters and a much more intricate storyline, which is all well and good for a graphic novel, but it can dilute a movie and shift focus away from the main plot.  \n\nAnd in V for Vendetta (the film), with a time budget of about two hours max, involving so many extra subplots would only have taken away from the primary storylines of Evey's transformation, V's backstory, and the nation's awakening.  What works well in one medium doesn't always succeed in another.\n\nAnd besides, it's fun to see a story told differently (IMHO).  I don't think religious adherence to the source material is always necessarily a good thing.

I'm also extremely fond of the dystopian genre, and while this isn't nearly as bad as most modern dystopian works (Divergent and all that garbage), it is again rather transparent in its influences.

Yet another graphic novel has been bulldozed on to the screen, strutting its stuff for an assumed army of uncritical geeks - a fanbase product from which the fanbase has been amputated. This film manages to be, at all times, weird and bizarre and baffling, but in a completely boring way. Watching it is like having the oxygen supply to your brain slowly starved over more than two hours. The script is by the Wachowski brothers, based on the original comic-book creation by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, and James McTeigue directs - graduating to his first feature after assisting on the Matrix sequels.\n\n>Imagine, if you will, the Britain of some 20 years hence as a kind of retro-futurist Orwellian police state with tatty, Blitz-era posters with creepy state slogans on decaying brick walls, but modern buildings like the Gherkin visible on the London skyline, and in which there are portraits of John Hurt everywhere as a gauntly bearded, Leninist Big Brother. You will have to imagine it pretty hard, because this movie has not imagined it, at least in no more than in an 1980s pop video way. The British people are living in a state of resentful oppression and dental disrepair: and they are represented in various scenes by about a dozen or so Equity members, quaintly shown at the pub or in their prole front rooms, glumly watching the state television network on which propaganda is pumped out.\n\n>There is, it seems, a lone terrorist-cum-revolutionary opposed to all this: a Scarlet Pimpernel figure whisking through the shadows, spouting rhetoric, and generally causing mayhem. His name is simply V, a man with a vendetta against tyranny and some personal grudges; he affects the cloak, hat and grinning mask of Guy Fawkes, the most famous conspirator in the 1605 Gunpowder Plot. The voice is by Hugo Weaving. V has a friend, ally and, who knows, perhaps even a beauty-and-the-beast-style love interest in a young woman called Evey - geddit? - a television researcher played by the reliably terrible Natalie Portman.\n\n>V is a mystery; he begins the film by blowing up London's central criminal court, the Old Bailey, with a firework display of explosives, accompanied by Tchaikovsky's 1812, which he has sneaked on to the police PA system - and he has more inspiring and, apparently, victimless crime-spectaculars in mind. How exactly V has managed to do this is a big mystery, the secret to which the film is uninterested in revealing. Pettifogging real-world considerations wouldn't matter, or matter as much, if the style and design were in any way witty or interesting. They sadly aren't, and McTeigue believes that by repeatedly showing people with shadows falling mysteriously across their faces he is reproducing the world of the comic book. V's fight scenes, featuring much oblique slashing with highly polished blades, are unexciting and unscary.\n\n>Portman for some reason has a thin, wittering South African accent as Evey, which may have been superior to other thin, wittering accents she tried out in rehearsal. There are a couple of London coppers played by Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves and in the course of apprehending a suspect Graves actually uses the word \"chummy\" - for which he deserved to have his collar felt by someone or other. John Hurt plays the sinister Chancellor figure, seen addressing his creepy cabinet of enforcers as a giant face on a screen, a hackneyed design tic that may be intended to recall his performance as Winston Smith in the movie version of 1984. Roger Allam plays a blustering, reactionary TV commentator who naturally turns out to be a former black-uniformed agent of the state.\n\n>None of these characters is convincing on any level, but interestingly something might have been made of the persona of Deitrich, the closet-gay TV host who employs Evey. He is played by Stephen Fry with an energy that hints that with a better written role, or really any sort of role at all, he could have raised this film's game a notch or two.\n\n>V For Vendetta is such an odd mixture: partly naive post-punk posturing, betraying the original's 1981 origins, and partly well-meant (but very American) condescension towards London and Britain. Like tourists with a phrasebook, the Wachowskis get people to say \"bollocks\" a fair bit, and there is a pastiche of The Benny Hill Show. On the higher end of the cultural scale, V declaims Shakespeare, and in honour of Guy Fawkes's subversion in the age of James I, reels off lots of Macbeth. But he fails to quote the only appropriate lines: the ones about it being a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/17/1", "id": "d1nb9ls"}, {"comment": "What does this even mean?

The film is a visual insult.\" On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says \"it's not hard to see why,\" as well as criticising Portman's performance: \"Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance.\"\n\n>Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is \"a bit of a mess... it rarely thrills or engages as a story.\"\n\nThe use of the Guy Fawkes mask in the film was a ever-present niggle. In reality, Guy Fawkes was a terrorist intent on blowing up the houses of parliament and all those in it. He and his fellow conspirators wanted to assassinate the king and replace him with a catholic. Had the plot been successful it would have been the UK's 9/11 and plunged the country into turmoil. \n\nGuy Fawkes Day is celebrated on November 5th every year to commemorate his capture and execution as a terrorist who was threatening the king and England.\n\nHe was absolutely not a folk hero representing the popular will of the nation fighting against an unjust government.

People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\nIt occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.\n\nI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\nJust to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.\n\nWe listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: \"November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.\"\n\nNow the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\nJust moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.\" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\"\n\nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\nSomewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: \"Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\"\n\nI think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.\"\n\nFor a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, \"Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\"\n\nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.\n\nFor just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.", "id": "d1ptl4p"}, {"comment": "Thanks for posting that.

Siskel found it to be \"sweet more than it was scary\" and \"quite beautiful\", also praising its straightforward story and remarked that he would recommend it to children over Disney's Oliver and Company, released the same day. In his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, writing \"I guess I sort of liked the film, although I wonder why it couldn't have spent more time on natural history and the sense of discovery, and less time on tragedy.\" Peter Travers of People magazine felt the movie had an unclear audience, stating \"The animation is fine. But the Stu Krieger screenplay contains violence that might be hard on the younger ones, \\[...\\] and a never-let-up cuteness that can turn minds of all ages to mush.\" Los Angeles Times writer Sheila Benson also stated that the movie's enjoyment was limited to younger viewers, remarking \"do dinosaurs really lend themselves to ootsie-cutesiness?\"\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?The+Land+Before+Time+%281988%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1239400), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/land_before_time/), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/683101), [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/en/the_land_before_time).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4db2ah \"Confidence: 1.05\").

Later, they used this information to locate the monster and built the Chuai station over top of it, claiming (falsely) that they were drilling for oil there.\n\nShortly before the rig was supposed to open, Tagruato sent several submarines from the station down six miles to the ocean floor to study the monster.

Like a child learning how to walk, you must crawl first!\"\n\nSound familiar? Anyway...\n\nI need to clarify, then, that by \"crapping on it\", I am referring *specifically* to the *intent* of those who *disrespect*, in some cases it is through negligence and ignorance. THEY DON'T CARE. They are NOT interested in the more beautiful aspects of culture, as they are profit/business-driven. Nevermind high art. There is no drive to understand or create bridges \u2014 or even summon the compassion to consider *why* someone else might be offended by their perceived appropriation, let alone engage in conversation about it \u2014 that is a null void.\n\nWhy, they don't do it for joy or even to build upon what exists, it is a short-sighted and money-driven myopia (as opposed to, an ethical business that would donate part of its profits towards a good cause). For example, cheap Chinese knockoff goods including the \"super-generic Pocahontas costumes\". The laborers working on these are under hard times to earn a living for their families, they have their own problems and attention to focus upon. They are perhaps unknowing of the \"blueprints\" their corporate masters passed down, and are not doing it to gain appreciation for Native American culture, before said outfits are shipped Stateside and provide perfunctory amusement and Buzzfeed jokes come Halloween. Wearing such an outfit \u2014 a product without a *why* (a la Simon Sinek) \u2014 is unlikely to inspire one to learn more about First Nation peoples.\n\nAll of that is in stark difference to, say, a weeaboo who may be \"culture clumsy\" but is earnestly *curious* and *hungry* to learn more about Japanese culture, though he may have started from a \"shallow\" anime series and is progressing deeper. He actually cares about what he is adopting. That's the kind of growth I enjoy seeing nourished and nurtured.\n\nIn contrast, those knockoffs (in an isolated system) are not a useful contribution towards building bridges between cultures. Now, to riff on what you pointed out, it's likely that due to our connected and tangential world, OTHERS will see these shallow ploys and missteps and use them as \"teachable moments\" (there's another loaded phrase) to create positive waves and the transformations you speak of.\n\nAnyway, I encourage you to keep being bold, passion *and* precision pours through your words. :D", "id": "d7egc92"}, {"comment": ">The way you explain things makes me smile\n\nWow, thank you!

That is noble. She didn't do a very good job of deciding HOW to help. \n\nYet she is hated just as bad as deliberate mockers. \n\nNow do you see why it is sticky to take such an extreme position on something that can only be accurately judged by basically being psychic?

Among those interviewed, only her stockbroker and Danny Buck, the local district attorney, are unsympathetic toward the sunny, sometimes saccharine Bernie. Marjorie changes from sour and alone to happy with Bernie; then she gets possessive.

Have you see them? They are some of the best animated movies on the market. \n\nThe Madagascar films have a visual wonder unlike any other animated movie, they are so stylized and unique looking with unmatched editing and direction. They bring out the very best old 50s cartoons and adapt them for modern use. From an animation standpoint they are mind blowing. The Penguins movie had a 5 minute single take like that in Children of Men or Rope, that isn't common denominator stuff, that is brilliant and well thought out. It is sure as hell smart. And Madagascar 3 was written by the writer of the oscar nominated Squid and Whale and Oscar nominated Fantastic Mr Fox. And that writing shows. It is so witty and tightly written. I am sorry, but it is unfair to call them cheap and not smart. Maybe the first two, but they are still leagues ahead of most non pixar disney movies. \n\nAs for Kung Fu Panda, have you seen it? I am not trying to be an ass or anything film is subjective. But it is amazing and 90% of critics would agree. It uses a smart mix of 2d and 3d animation, switches between styles, cross frames like old Kung Fu movies, and by far the best digital cinematography I have ever seen in a movie. I'll send some links from that and Madagascar 3. \n\nI want to emphasize I am not being a dick and I am fine if you disagree it doesn't affect me, but some of those movies I listed are not dumb and are not garbage. They can be in your eyes, but just check critic reviews and watch them if you haven't. \n\nChase from Madagascar 3. The humor is so fast paced and very visual and the writing is very tight.

I think /u/TBoarder has pointed out some very important distinctions that are correct. Firstly, there is a difference between being homophobic and hating gays, and secondly he's right that people don't choose how they feel about things. \n\nI've known many people who are homophobic and many who just hated gays. I'm friends with several of the former and even some of the latter. You're probably wondering how I can be friends with someone like that. That's because I see all the other good qualities in them, just like they see all the other good qualities in me. Ya see.... It's a sad truth but fear and hatred are part of the human condition and humanity isn't some exclusive club for the righteous. People are flawed. All we can do is try our best to rise above and be better than that. \n\nI can't help being gay no more than some people can help being weird-ed out or disgusted by the fact that I am. Some people love anchovies and others hate them. Just because someone doesn't like something doesn't mean they're going around trying to hurt those who disagree. Believe it or not, sometimes people do strive to be better than their own beliefs. \n\nBut it's also important to remember that many people aren't homophobic out of malice. Much of the time it's because they haven't really been exposed to people who are gay and can't understand homosexuality due to being surrounded by a culture of misinformation, socially conservative ideology, religion, and yes just plain ignorance. However ignoring these people will never solve anything. In fact it just allows that type of thinking to grow and spread. \n\nHow you help is by trying to be a good example. I hope that through my actions I can show them that their is nothing wrong with being gay and that their preconceived notions and thoughts about homosexuality might be wrong. I'd like to think I've made a difference and I know to some friends I have, but for some others I still have a long way to go and for some I know they may never be completely okay with it.

If you've ever been bullied, watching Biff sneer at George should simultaneously make your palms sweat and your blood boil.

That said,  the story there was kind of done. There wasn't much more that staying there could've added,  so I understand the move. \n\n>* A good majority of the dialogue is exposition and not story. \n\nHmm. This is one I have trouble arguing.  I'll need to ratchet to address it fairly. What I can say is that Doc has alwayd been kind of an expository character, which I always felt does him as a man of science - fact and expansion over emotion. \n\n>* Biff turns into a crazy murdering maniac instead of just a bully. And I thought he was suppose to be the meek, ineffectual guy from the first film after George knocked him out? That's some shitty writing.\n\nThat's only in 1985A. My understanding was that, whether or not George would've punched Biff out without Marty's interference in 1955A, Biff having the Almanac would dramatically change his response to that experience. In 1955, Biffs big thing was his rough and tough attitude - he lost his macho demeanour when scrawny George McFly laid him out. With the Almanac in his pocket, Buffalo would've had a lot more going for him. Rather than standing down,  he would know that he could start betting and making millions and become the most powerful man in the city. At that point, greed and revenge become his motivators. He dreams of becoming so powerful that he can destroy George McFly with no consequences and take Lorraine for himself because George destroyed him at his peak.  It's very dark but it's a logical character progression. \n\n>* The 1985A timelines is so over the top and ridiculous that it makes no goddamn sense. Biff turns Hill Valley into a wasteland where you have gangs, bikers, and the National Guard roaming around?!? And we have to go back to the *same* area, again...\n\nNot necessarily. Biff is only focused on himself and getting revenge on George/getting Lorraine. The town running amock with gangs and everything is in pure consequence of the direction Biff the town in by buying the police department (allowing whoever he wanted to get away with crimes) creating the casino and changing the laws. Again, this is not so far fetched to me. Is it aggressive? Sure. But give the wrong person to much money and power and a lot of terrible things can go down. \n\nIf you live in the states,  make sure you vote this year. \n\n>* The 1955A timeline is (like I said) the same as the first movie, just slightly different. \n\nI love that about all the movies. Using the town square is a writing device to show how different each timeline and time frame is. It's a reference point that the viewer can compare each scene to.\n\n>* Docs explanation of the \"time paradox\" if Marty (or anyone) runs into their future-self is retarded. So either  the other person will pass out from shock, or it could *destroy the entire universe*. That's....so...I can't even. Why make the stakes be literally the worst possible thing that could happen ever or absolutely nothing?\n\nDepends entirely on the interaction. It's a pretty big window, but anything could happen. The point there is that Doc have experienced that situation. As the creator of a time machine,  he understands that he shouldn't interact with himself so he hasn't. He can only speculate as to how catastrophic the results of doing so would be. \n\n>* Marty's inexplicable aversion to being called a chicken (like you said).\n\nYeah that bothers me. The only thing that truly bothers me about the series. I have to go through the deleted scenes from the first one again. If there's something in there, anything that alludes to that, it would be so satisfying.\n\n>* Rips off too much from the first. \"Hey, remember that time in the first one when Marty created skateboarding? How about in this one, we do a shot-for-shot remake with *hoverboards.* No, it's not ripping it off... it's a homage!\"\n\nNot quite scene for scene, but ok. I love that scene because of the similarities to the original. Its the connection between generations - once a butthead,  always a butthead. \n\n>* Why is Biff in the future a bully? Why is Griff a bully? At least in the third one you have Mad Dog which is a different character.\n\nSee above\n\n>The visuals in the future were awesome though.

Marty Mcfly will eternally be the coolest person in the world to me.  He rode a skateboard, played the guitar, had a hot girlfriend and hung out with a crazy wild eyed scientist. He had a good heart, took chances and didn't take shit from anyone. \n\nIn addition to having an awesome protagonist, we're treated to one of the most sadistic and menacing villains of all time. Biff Tannen was terrifying. He was cruel, quick tempered and HUGE. He relished tormenting and intimidating George Mcfly everyday of his life. To me, Biff was so frightening because he exists in the real world. Of all the monster movies I watched growing up, no one scared me quite like Biff Tannen could. Jason...Freddy Krueger...the shark from Jaws wouldn't be waiting to greet me at school the next day. If you've ever been bullied, watching Biff sneer at George should simultaneously make your palms sweat and your blood boil. I love what Tom Wilson did with character and didn't appreciate until I got older just how damn well he played his part. \n\nI adore this movie and all of its sequels. They just do not make movies like this anymore. The perfect blend of humor, action, and suspense. Not to mention the gorgeous cinematography and air tight continuity. There was also the amazing soundtrack by Huey Lewis and the News and the light as air score by Alan Silvestri perfectly complimenting the tense action on screen. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, I just started typing and because I love this movie so much it just kept flowing. I'll close with sharing the inspiration for this post, my favorite scene out of all three films and possibly of all time. The clock tower scene at the end of the first movie, where Marty is racing the Delorean toward the wire. Now I can't count the number of times I've watched this movie, and every time, each and every time I watch this scene even though I know the outcome, there is still that tense uncertainty wether or not Marty will make it home to 1985 and I'm forever on the edge of my seat.

The film follows two friends who need to quickly earn enough cash playing poker to pay off a large debt. The term \"rounder\" refers to a person travelling around from city to city seeking high-stakes cash games.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote\\: \"Rounders sometimes has a noir look but it never has a noir feel, because it's not about losers (or at least it doesn't admit it is). It's essentially a sports picture, in which the talented hero wins, loses, faces disaster, and then is paired off one last time against the champ\". In her review for the New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote\\: \"Though John Dahl's Rounders finally adds up to less than meets the eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is mischievously entertaining\". USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and wrote\\: \"The card playing is well-staged, and even those who don't know a Texas hold-'em ('the Cadillac of poker') from a Texas hoedown will get a vicarious charge out of the action\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"B\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"Norton, cast in what might have once been the Sean Penn role (hideous shirts, screw-you attitude), gives Worm a shifty, amphetamine soul and a pleasing alacrity ... Norton's performance never really goes anywhere, but that's okay, since the story is just an excuse to lead the characters from one poker table to the next\".\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Rounders+%281998%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rounders%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1083659-rounders/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rounders), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/17236920), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q832728).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F59dtcv \"Confidence: 1.07\").

Unlike Worm, Mike is in control ... of everything except his need to play poker. I agree that turning down Petra at that moment requires significant suspension of willful disbelief. She's pretty hot.

The film follows two friends who need to quickly earn enough cash playing poker to pay off a large debt. The term \"rounder\" refers to a person travelling around from city to city seeking high-stakes cash games.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote\\: \"Rounders sometimes has a noir look but it never has a noir feel, because it's not about losers (or at least it doesn't admit it is). It's essentially a sports picture, in which the talented hero wins, loses, faces disaster, and then is paired off one last time against the champ\". In her review for the New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote\\: \"Though John Dahl's Rounders finally adds up to less than meets the eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is mischievously entertaining\". USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and wrote\\: \"The card playing is well-staged, and even those who don't know a Texas hold-'em ('the Cadillac of poker') from a Texas hoedown will get a vicarious charge out of the action\". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \"B\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \"Norton, cast in what might have once been the Sean Penn role (hideous shirts, screw-you attitude), gives Worm a shifty, amphetamine soul and a pleasing alacrity ... Norton's performance never really goes anywhere, but that's okay, since the story is just an excuse to lead the characters from one poker table to the next\".\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Rounders+%281998%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rounders%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1083659-rounders/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/rounders), [Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/17236920), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q832728).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F59dtcv \"Confidence: 1.07\").

The series follows the misadventures of alcoholic scientist Rick and his easily influenced grandson Morty, who split their time between domestic family life and interdimensional travel. Roiland voices the series' eponymous characters, while the series also stars the voice talent of Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer, and Sarah Chalke. The series has its origins in an animated parody of Back to the Future created by Roiland for film festival Channel 101\\. Adult Swim approached Harmon for television show ideas, and he and Roiland developed the program based on the short's two characters.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> As of August 2016 the series has received universal critical acclaim, holding a 100% approval rating by critics on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Additionally, the first season of Rick and Morty holds a Metacritic score of 85 based on eight reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".

The series follows the misadventures of alcoholic scientist Rick and his easily influenced grandson Morty, who split their time between domestic family life and interdimensional travel. Roiland voices the series' eponymous characters, while the series also stars the voice talent of Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer, and Sarah Chalke. The series has its origins in an animated parody of Back to the Future created by Roiland for film festival Channel 101\\. Adult Swim approached Harmon for television show ideas, and he and Roiland developed the program based on the short's two characters.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> As of August 2016 the series has received universal critical acclaim, holding a 100% approval rating by critics on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes.

They're a perversion of the whole thing.  It's just like the scene with Margot Robbie explaining CDO's.  Would it be cool for Margot Robbie to show up in your bubble bath?  Yeah!  In fact, it would be too good to be true, just like CDO'S.  \n\nHere's how credit default swaps work.  Let's say you have money, and you want to lend that money out in exchange for monthly payments of x% of that debt plus a certain amount of interest.  Now, every major religion has rules against usury, but we're a godless heathen society, so whatcha gonna do. \n\nSo, some schmuck comes looking for a loan, you lend it, business happens,  bada boom bada bing.  Everybody goes home happy.\n\nBut wait!  Some other guy comes to you with a deal.  He's got this invention called a credit default swap.  He's gonna bet you that this guy who you just leant a bunch of money to won't pay.  \n\nNow, you've done your homework on this guy who you just loaned money to.  He's rated triple A.  In fact, he's part of a whole group of guys that are rated AAA.  That's all you need to see to give him a loan.  And since that guy was rated AAA, this other guy, who thinks the first guy is gonna default, must be off his rocker.  But he's willing to give you money every month on this bet.  So, now you have an opportunity to get the debt, to get the interest AND make the bet money every month.\n\nOf course you're gonna take that bet.  You're in the business of making money.  \n\nOf course, the downside to that bet is that you have to pay up if the debtor actually does default.  But he's rated AAA, so you're golden. \n\nBut the downside to that AAA rating is that there are a couple different ratings agencies, and you're paying them to rate certain sketchy individuals highly so that you can make more loans that look good.  But it's okay, because it's only one guy.\n\nExcept it's not only one guy.  In fact, it's a significant portion of the people who you've loaned money to over the past decade.  But it's okay, because you've got money. \n\nBut, it turns out you've made these kind of bets alot.  In fact, the amount of money that you would owe on credit default swaps is more money than you have.  But it's okay, because surely not everyone is gonna default at once, right?\n\n\nExcept that's exactly what happened.  The guys who were rated AAA shouldn't have been.  The ratings agencies fraudulently rated them high, because you were paying them to.  You were telling them to do that you could make these loans with the appearance of propriety that wasn't really there.  Then, you made these side bets.  When the debts all came due, there was NO money, so you had to pull from your reserves in order to pay your own debts.  \n\nAnd that was the exact moment that everyone realized the game was rigged.  Your investors pulled out, taking their own money.  Then, you had no money, more debt than you could pay and boom, belly up.\n", "id": "d52dk3e"}, {"comment": "One thing to add, with the housing market specifically, when some in an area start doing poorly, then the economy stops improving.

Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Lou Bloom, a driven young man desperate for work who discovers the high-speed world of L.A. crime journalism. Finding a group of freelance camera crews who film crashes, fires, murder and other mayhem, Lou muscles into the cut-throat, dangerous realm of nightcrawling - where each police siren wail equals a possible windfall and victims are converted into dollars and cents. Aided by Rene Russo as Nina, a veteran of the blood-sport that is local TV news, Lou blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Nightcrawler received critical acclaim, with many praising Gyllenhaal's performance and Gilroy's script.

The site's critical consensus reads\\: \"Restless, visually sleek, and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler offers dark, thought-provoking thrills.\" On Metacritic, another review aggregator, the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".

Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Lou Bloom, a driven young man desperate for work who discovers the high-speed world of L.A. crime journalism. Finding a group of freelance camera crews who film crashes, fires, murder and other mayhem, Lou muscles into the cut-throat, dangerous realm of nightcrawling - where each police siren wail equals a possible windfall and victims are converted into dollars and cents. Aided by Rene Russo as Nina, a veteran of the blood-sport that is local TV news, Lou blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story.\n(*IMDb*)\n\n**Critical reception:**\n> Nightcrawler received critical acclaim, with many praising Gyllenhaal's performance and Gilroy's script. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 95%, based on 226 reviews, with a rating average of 8\\.2\\/10\\. The site's critical consensus reads\\: \"Restless, visually sleek, and powered by a lithe star performance from Jake Gyllenhaal, Nightcrawler offers dark, thought-provoking thrills.\" On Metacritic, another review aggregator, the film has a score of 76 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B\u2013\" on an A\\+ to F scale.\n(*Wikipedia*)\n\nMore info at [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/Title?Nightcrawler+%282014%29), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nightcrawler%20%28film%29), [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nightcrawler/), [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/nightcrawler), [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15154975).  \n*I am a bot.* [Send me feedback](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMovieGuide&subject=Re%3A%20http%3A%2F%2Fredd.it%2F4wurqf \"Confidence: 1.09\").

This subreddit wasn't created with the intent to collect data on who likes what.\n\nIf you want to see what the community likes, then sort by \"Top\". Then you can see what people actually like. You don't need multiple posts to say what one post with many upvotes already does.\n\n>And, I really want to reiterate: if you don't like it, downvote it, and add your own content. Don't bitch and moan while doing anything to change it.\n\nI always use the voting system. The problem is that you are relying on that system alone to deliver good content, when in reality, the upvote/downvote system just causes a giant echo chamber of the same posts getting upvoted to the top over and over again. Having one guy downvote a post doesn't fix shitty content from appearing (just look at /r/adviceanimals).\n\nWhen this subreddit was small, reposting wasn't an issue, because the community was niche enough that the only people subscribed were the people that actually cared about really digging deep and finding the \"best of Netflix\". As this subreddit grew in size, however, it became littered with more and more reposts, and already well known shows.\n\nWithout moderator intervention, you can't have a subreddit that maintains the quality of a small subreddit forever.  Take a look at /r/askhistorians. They are constantly toted about as the poster child for good rule making and good moderation, simply because they were able to make rules and stick to them.\n\nI personally think there should be a limit to reposts (maybe once a month?). It would force some actual diversity, and we wouldn't get the same reposted shows over and over. If a show is popular, it will be upvoted. Constant reposts, and posts like these just seem to be easy karma for folks who stumble upon here from /r/all.\n\n", "id": "d6gte2b"}, {"comment": "hnyeh", "id": "d6gjgzc"}, {"comment": "How high are you?", "id": "d6gklur"}], [{"comment": "My favorite background noise show", "id": "d6ggqqx"}, {"comment": "Or napping show.", "id": "d6gia30"}, {"comment": "This and Scrubs are my two favorite fall to sleep to shows.

", "id": "czp0951"}, {"comment": "Okay here it is. My full review.  \nI\u2019m a big fan of Billy Joel. I know a good 75% of his songs by heart, even the sucky one. One such sucky one was called \u201cLeningrad\u201d and it was about this depressing guy Victor who had a depressing life and it was an attempt to humanize Russian during the Cold War. A quote from that song that says \u201cThe only way to live was drown the hate/ Russian life was very sad/ such was life in Leningrad\u201d This perfectly sums up the story of The doctor. No not the doctor with trench coat and the long scarf. But a bright eyed bushy tailed helper turned sour faster than Christopher Eccleston who eventually thinks that trying morphine is a jolly good choice.    \nA Young Doctor\u2019s Notebook is a 2012 miniseries put on by the BBC. BBC is very great at making short short shows, but they have outdone themselves in this 8-episode foray into Russian literature. The plot is this: Jon Hamm has decided to read his diary before he injects his latest batch of morphine. Therefor he acts as the textbook definition of an unreliable narrator popping into Daniel Radcliff\u2019s story. Harry Potter\u2019s story is about how he is sent to bum fuck nowhere Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution. If you never been to bum fuck nowhere Russia, it\u2019s a lot like bum fuck Kansas but a lot lot more snow.   \nWell anyway, the series is a dark \u201ccomedy\u201d and if I could put those quotation marks bigger I would. It is a comedy in the way that I am a critic, such that if the terminology was looser it would be my mother. It is a comedy because it made me laugh at how absurd and awkward it is. Also it draws the philosophy of people who just witnessed a mass murder, because after you see how hopeless, depressing, and unfair life (specifically life in Russia) is, all you can do is nervously laugh even though something is only slightly funny. I\u2019m not insulting the \u201ccomedy\u201d I just don\u2019t think comedy is the right word for it.    \nPickled sprouts, Leopold Leoplodavich, and 15 fives. All are fantastic running jokes that add to the payoff of this buildup of comedic and dramatic tension. Joniel Radamm, provides to be the proverbial \u201cStrait man\u201d among the characters of norther Russia, although the Hamm story line kind of patters out in the back half. It is as if the writers did not expect a second series and then said \u201cwhat do we do with the older doctor, I know let\u2019s just throw him in to dialogue with the younger one.\u201d [is it a dialogue or a monologue if it\u2019s the same character? {that\u2019s been the ultimate question since Shakespear wrote Hamlet}]    \nNever mind about the \u201ccomedy\u201d, how is the Drama you might ask. Well to alive some tension, Horny Potter gets into a chamber of secrets if you know what I mean. But for being a \u201cmetical drama\u201d there is a lot of medical, not much drama. People die in this series; people also live but the moral of the story is they too will die one day. If not from the cold, from those damn communist Billy Joel was trying to sympathize with.    \nIt\u2019s not the best work by either actor, nor the best thing BBC has offered the world. That being said, it is 8 episodes long and deals with themes like death and addiction in ways western people may find very hard to swallow. This show it has a great build up and release cycle that gives you that sort of \"stressed out\" laugh, that I enjoy sometimes.\n", "id": "czpk26e"}, {"comment": "I liked it!

It's only available in the US (by Netflix DVD at that) but it's a pretty awesome movie. I would say that it's right up there in cultural, well, maybe not relevance but the impression? Experience?

And then we explained it was like a lake and you could sail around it and maybe be land on two different shores at the same time or that it was always the same shore just from a different direction, or the same shore at different \"times\" (but that's a somewhat recursive desription so viewing the \"times\" as different approaches is easier)? And now we sort of explain it as an ocean that's infinite in size and touching every shore, but touching said shores in the same place within that ocean which may still only be only one shore reached from different approaches, except that the direction traveled is actually always the same and we just notice different things or are viewing it at different angles thinking it's a different approach? And how that sort explanation is wrong in pretty much every particular but it can be used to get the idea across?\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that there is a je ne sais quois that they both share thanks to the era and how the films were directed, similar available technology and sort of a shared approach to dealing with the social issues of the times through fiction.\n\nI have had some drinks.

Goin' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on goin'. Never said nothin' goin' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. *And in the dream I knew that he was goin' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there.* **And then I woke up...**   \n  \nLife doesn't have a path. There's nobody lighting the way for you to follow in the dark. There is nobody to tell you which way to go, because we're all lost in the dark together.  \n  \nChigurh clearly understands this concept, and his way of coping with it is to have *his own* code that he rigorously and ruthlessly follows. He lets the random flip of a coin decide the fate of his victims, and often goes out of his way to stay consistent with his code.  \nFor instance, he goes back to murder Moss' wife, even after Moss is dead and he has the money.

", "id": "d6ke6gv"}, {"comment": "The car crash further reinforces the absurdist themes and shows that Chigurh (personification of evil forces in the universe) is at the whim of randomness as well. The whole movie we see him calculating every move and methodically stalking his prey, however even he can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on him either, that's vanity. The movie is about Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee) coming to terms with the chaotic nature of the universe and reconciling his worldview with the reality he observes. In his opening monologue he expresses his belief that the world is becoming a more dangerous and chaotic place and expresses a nostalgic longing for the simpler \"old times\" where there was order, and sheriffs didn't even need to wear guns. His father represents this nostalgic \"Old times\" era for him. The sheriff struggles to come to terms with the random violence and chaotic nature of the universe which is demonstrated through the Llewelyn vs. Chigurh cat and mouse chase which we observe with the sheriff. Sheriff Bell has held that job since he was a young man at age 25, his father was a sheriff at the same time, and was his role model.  He believed the world would start to make sense as he aged, \"God would suddenly come into my life\". His father died at a much younger age and thus never gave him a model for how to be an old man. What the sheriff observes with the Chigurh case makes it clear to the sheriff that there is no order in the universe, no rhyme or reason. The story his brother tells him about how their uncle died shows him that there never was any, the nostalgic \"old times\" is just a fantasy. In the first dream he is talking to his father about money he lost which is an allusion to the Llewelyn vs. Chigurh story arc and is meta commentary about its relative insignificance in the grand scheme as he quickly forgets that dream. In the second dream he is in the old times with his father and his father is riding ahead of him to build a fire and bring order to the dark, cold, and unforgiving land and show him the path, make sense of it all. This was the sheriff's constructed worldview. There's a feeling of comfort, a longing for his father to serve that role for him. He longs for order. However the sheriff never sees him again in the dream. No sense is made, no order. The sheriff just awakens to reality.
