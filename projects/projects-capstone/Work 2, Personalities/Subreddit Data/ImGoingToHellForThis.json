It's not so much being \"smart\" as it is not being stupid. Fact is, the body needs nutrients not found in vegan diets. There are some rare amino acids and proteins only found it meats. Not getting them makes us weak, compromises our immune system and is very unhealthy over the long term -- it's why many hardcore vegans look sickly. Many animals, like cats, will *die* if put on a vegan/vegetarian diet for this very reason. They need amino acids like Taurine for effective heart function. Their hearts literally stop beating if they don't get it. We need it to, but we won't die from it because our body produces trace amounts on its own. But just barely. \n\nWe are also learning new shit about nutrition every single day. You'll see reports like \"A vegan diet is just as healthy as any other!\" and while factually true, there's a qualifier. That qualifier is that you supplement all those proteins and amino acids you'd normally get by eating meat. Unfortunately, I have yet to meet a vegan or vegetarian who does this. Oh, some may try, but they'll get lazy and forget or will leave stuff out after a while thinking it's unnecessary.

We also don't get cholesterol from plant foods, but our body makes the perfect amount and dietary cholesterol is not needed and very harmful in excess. As for \"rare amino acids\", there are 9 amino acids which are essential for our diet, and they are all found in plant foods. Vegans don't need to \"supplement\" proteins or amino acids, that is just absurd. I don't know where you got that information, but whoever told you that is very, very wrong. \n\nYour cat might die if you put them on a vegan diet (without supplementation) but that is because your cat is a carnivore, where humans are omnivores and can live on a plant based diet, or a diet with animal products. \n\nAnd it's weird how you think most vegans are just too \"lazy\" to look after their own diet, when vegans are statistically far healthier than meat eaters (http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/R-D/Veg-congress-day-one-The-fact-vegetarians-are-healthier-than-meat-eaters-is-one-of-the-most-consistent-findings-of-nutritional-epidemiology).

When you consider the moral, political, economic and environmental benefits of a vegan diet, which affects the whole world, it's a little silly to begrudge 12 euro a year.   \nhttp://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/", "id": "d5r6odr"}, {"comment": "Great post, thanks!

The child, who along with his younger sister and brother had been confined to the home for three years, said their stay was like a \u201cjail term\u201d during which his name was also changed.\n\n>\u201cI was allowed to meet my parents once a month for only 15 minutes. The only thing I was taught was the Bible. They forced me to memorise its passages,\u201d the boy told HT on Thursday and added that the children were forced to consume buffalo meat and \u201cparaded\u201d before potential donors.\n\u201cThey gave us good clothes whenever visitors came. They made us stand in line and recite Bible passages. Faltering meant a beating with sticks and belts later,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the guests left, the shelter in-charge snatched away our clothes, sweets and gifts and we were back in rags again.\u201d\nHis 11-year-old sister said the children were forced to sleep on a dirty floor that was littered with rodent droppings.\n\u201cThey never allowed us to step outside. We were not given food for three days at a stretch if we forgot a Bible passage.\u201d\n\n>\u201cA case was registered at the Bisrakh police station following the raid. The children complained they were tortured and beaten up for not following the orders of the caretakers. We are investigating whether the organisation had permission to run a shelter home. Three persons, including the caretaker of the shelter home, have been detained and are being questioned. We are investigating the claims of the rescued children,\u201d said Ashwani Kumar, in charge, Bisrakh police station.\n\n>Their mother, whose complaint with a children\u2019s helpline led to the raids, said she was approached by one Josua Devraj at a Delhi hospital around three years ago. \u201cHe said he will raise my children and make them IAS officers. **He forced us to circulate pamphlets and copies of the Bible in public places but never paid us,\u201d she said.\nTheir ordeal has not ended even after being rescued. The woman said the shelter\u2019s employees came to her house on Tuesday night and threatened to take her three children back. \u201cThey pelted stones at our house and beat us up with batons. They fled when the neighbours gathered,\u201d she said.**\n\n>\u201cThe victim\u2019s mother had approached us on December 28. We contacted the police and conducted a raid at Naya Haibatpur village in Bisrakh area. It was found that a shelter home with the name of Emanuel Sewa Group was operating illegally. Seven children were kept there in squalid and untidy condition. The children were also found to be malnourished. A subsequent raid was conducted at the shelter home of the same organisation in Meerut from where 23 children were rescued,\u201d said Satyaprakash, programme manager, FXB Suraksha NGO.\nSatyaprakash further said, \u201cThe complainant said she was not allowed to meet her children for months and told us that they might have been shifted to some other place. After we conducted a raid, it was found that her children were lodged at an illegal shelter home of the same trust in Dehradun. Following the raid, the children were brought back to Greater Noida.\u201d\n\n>He said the children revealed that they were being served cockroach-infested food and were forced to live in a substandard condition.\n\n>\u201cMost of them are malnourished and sick. They need proper medication and care. We are in talks with their family members. They will be sent back to their homes soon,\u201d Satyaprakash said.\nWhen contacted, accused Joshua Devraj accepted that a raid was conducted at his shelter homes but refused to comment on the issue.\n\n>\u201cYes, raids were conducted but I cant tell you much about it. I will comment on this issue later,\u201d he said.\n\nThe fact that we still have missionary groups taking children away from their parents, beating, and starving them if they don't memorize Bible passages doesn't sound like a \"live and let live\" mentality.

Before entering, the shooters threw two bombs into the cafeteria, both of which exploded. They then threw another bomb into the Library Hallway; it exploded and damaged several lockers. At 11:29 a.m., Harris and Klebold entered the library, where a total of 52 students, two teachers and two librarians had concealed themselves.[14]\n\n>Harris yelled, \"Get up!\" in a tone so loud that he can be heard on Patti Nielson's 9-1-1 recording at 11:29:18.[50] Staff and students hiding in the library exterior rooms later said they also heard the gunmen say: \"All jocks stand up! We'll get the guys in white hats!\" (Wearing a white baseball cap at Columbine was a tradition among sports team members, typically jocks.)[14] When no one stood up, Harris said, \"Fine, I'll start shooting anyway!\" He fired his shotgun twice at a desk, not knowing that a student named Evan Todd was hiding beneath it. Todd was hit by wood splinters but was not seriously injured.\n\n>The shooters walked to the opposite side of the library, to two rows of computers. Todd hid behind the administrative counter. Kyle Velasquez, 16, was sitting at the north row of computers; police later said he had not hidden underneath the desk when Klebold and Harris had first entered the library, but had curled up under the computer table. Klebold shot and killed Velasquez, hitting him in the head and back. Klebold and Harris put down their ammunition-filled duffel bags at the south\u2014or lower\u2014row of computers and reloaded their weapons. They walked back toward the windows facing the outside staircase. Noticing police evacuating students outside the school, Harris said: \"Let's go kill some cops.\" He and Klebold began to shoot out the windows in the direction of the police, who returned fire; no one was injured.[37][51]\n\n>After firing through the windows at evacuating students and the police, Klebold fired his shotgun at a nearby table, injuring three students: Patrick Ireland, Daniel Steepleton, and Makai Hall.[14] He removed his trench coat. As Klebold fired at the three, Harris grabbed his shotgun and walked toward the lower row of computer desks, firing a single shot under the first desk without looking. He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck. Harris then shot under the adjacent computer desk, injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder and hand, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery.[52] When she started gasping in pain, Harris tersely stated, \"Quit your bitching\".\n\n>Harris walked over to the table across from the lower computer row, slapped the surface twice and knelt, saying \"Peek-a-boo\" to 17-year-old Cassie Bernall before shooting her once in the head, killing her instantly.[53] Harris had been holding the shotgun with one hand at this point and the weapon hit his face in recoil, breaking his nose. Initial reports suggest that Harris asked Bernall \"Do you believe in God?\", to which she replied yes, before getting killed. However, three students who witnessed Bernall's death, including Emily Wyant, who had been hiding beneath the table with her, have testified that Bernall did not exchange words with Harris after his initial taunt, although Wyant stated Bernall had been praying prior to her murder.[54]\n\n>After fatally shooting Bernall, Harris turned toward the next table, where Bree Pasquale sat next to the table rather than under it. Harris asked Pasquale if she wanted to die, and she responded with a plea for her life. Witnesses later reported that Harris seemed disoriented \u2014 possibly from the heavily bleeding wound to his nose. As Harris taunted Pasquale, Klebold noted Ireland trying to provide aid to Hall, who had suffered a wound to his knee. As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head rose above the table; Klebold shot him a second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot.[14] Ireland was knocked unconscious, but survived.\n\n>Klebold walked toward another set of tables, where he discovered 18-year-old Isaiah Shoels, 16-year-old Matthew Kechter and 16-year-old Craig Scott (the younger brother of Rachel Scott), hiding under one table. All three were popular athletes. Klebold tried to pull Shoels out from under the table. He called to Harris, referring to him by his online identity and shouting, \"REB! There's a nigger over here!\"[55] Harris left Pasquale and joined him. According to witnesses, Klebold and Harris taunted Shoels for a few seconds, making derogatory racial comments.[14] Harris knelt down and shot Shoels once in the chest at close range, killing him instantly. Klebold also knelt down and opened fire, hitting and killing Kechter. Harris then yelled; \"Who's ready to die next?\". Meanwhile, Scott was uninjured; he lay in the blood of his friends, feigning death.[14] Harris turned and threw a CO2 bomb at the table where Hall, Steepleton, and Ireland were located. It landed on Steepleton's thigh, and Hall quickly threw it away.\n\n>Harris walked toward the bookcases between the west and center section of tables in the library. He jumped on one and shook it, then shot in an unknown direction within that general area. Klebold walked through the main area, past the first set of bookcases, the central desk area and a second set of bookcases into the east area. Harris walked from the bookcase he had shot from, past the central area to meet Klebold. The latter shot at a display case located next to the door, then turned and shot toward the closest table, hitting and injuring 17-year-old Mark Kintgen in the head and shoulder. He then turned toward the table to his left and fired, injuring 18-year-olds Lisa Kreutz and Valeen Schnurr with the same shotgun blast. Klebold then moved toward the same table and fired with the TEC-9, killing 18-year-old Lauren Townsend. At this point, the seriously injured Valeen Schnurr began screaming, \"Oh my God, oh my God!\"[56] In response, Klebold asked Schnurr if she believed in the existence of God; when Schnurr replied she did, Klebold simply asked \"Why?\" before walking from the table.[57]\n\n>Harris approached another table where two girls were hiding. He bent down to look at them and dismissed them as \"pathetic\".[58] Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. When Tomlin attempted to move away from the table, Klebold kicked him. Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot the youth repeatedly, killing him. Harris then walked back over to the other side of the table where Lauren Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. An autopsy later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.\n\n>The shooters moved to the center of the library, where they continued to reload their weapons at a table there. Harris noticed a student hiding nearby and asked him to identify himself. It was John Savage, an acquaintance of Klebold's, who had come to the library to study for a history test. Savage said his name, believing they were targeting only jocks (which he himself was not), in an attempt to save his life; he then asked Klebold what they were doing, to which he answered, \"Oh, just killing people.\" Savage asked if they were going to kill him. Possibly because of a fire alarm, Klebold said, \"What?\" Savage asked again whether they were going to kill him. Klebold hesitated, then told him to leave. Savage fled immediately, and escaped through the library's main entrance.\n\n>After Savage had left, Harris turned and fired his carbine at the table directly north of where they had been, grazing the ear of 15-year-old Daniel Mauser. When Mauser fought back, shoving a chair at Harris, Harris fired again and hit Mauser in the face at close range, killing him. Both shooters moved south and fired randomly under another table, critically injuring two 17-year-olds, Jennifer Doyle and Austin Eubanks, and fatally wounding 17-year-old Corey DePooter. DePooter, the last to die in the massacre, at 11:35, was later credited with having kept his friends calm during the ordeal.[37][59]\n", "id": "d87zsnb"}, {"comment": "This is the scariest and most fucked up thing I have ever read.", "id": "d880yoc"}, {"comment": "My thoughts exactly, I thought I was immune to stuff making me feel uneasy online but Holy fuck this is next level.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "d9ozzfz"}, {"comment": "Unless it's in the title, apparently...", "id": "d9p2pgc"}, {"comment": "Yep, because titles on reddit are always just plaintext with no formatting.", "id": "d9p6bs8"}, {"comment": "Makes sense!", "id": "d9p98ra"}, {"comment": "\u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "id": "d9p3r12"}, {"comment": "\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\\\\n\n", "id": "d9p5oyj"}, {"comment": "Sorted: ()/\u30c4\\\\\\__\u00af\u00af", "id": "d9pcv41"}, {"comment": "I kinda love this particular bot.", "id": "d9p63dl"}, {"comment": "It's for sure handy.

Or they can automate, which costs $5 dollar per unit now due to R&D and high upfront investments, but will cost as low as $2 per unit once the technology is developed. \n\nBusinesses choose option 2 because it's the cheapest. You cut off option 2, or tax it to be more expensive than option 3, they're not going to go straight to option 1.

It's what fills in the blanks left in statutory law, so that the law is applied more evenly. \n\nA good lawyer will spend a lot of time learning and reviewing case law in order to steer a judge towards an ideal outcome for their clients. For instance, if you are found guilty of a crime, a good lawyer will find cases similar to yours and present those at court to justify a low sentence (he'll cherry pick the good ones) and a prosecutor will do the same, but find cases with harsher sentences. Then a judge will either take those at face value, or do their own research to determine a 'fair' sentence. \n\nDeviating from common law can be decent grounds for appeal (by either party). So it's not uncommon for judges to basically split the difference, then add any mitigating or aggravating circumstances to move towards one side or the other. \n\nCommon law is typically very prejudiced. Women will typically get lighter sentences than men, because of children, pregnancy, and generally lenient sentences given to women based on a history of judicial bias. Mothers will be given priority in a custody case, even if the father is better suited to raise a child, because past case law influences today's case law. Because judges were historically against taking a child away from their mothers, that's set a precedence that women can use to steer a judge toward granting them custody despite many aggravating factors. \n\nCase law is the law that fucks over the poor who can't afford a decent lawyer, and that benefits the rich, who can afford attorneys who will spend hundreds of hours (well, their paralegals will) reviewing old cases to find lenient sentences (and other legal precedents), and then 'shaping' their clients circumstances to fit that.

Freshly quickened by the divine correction, you must apply the strength of your righteousness to another matter which concerns you as well as God. For your brethren who live in the east are in urgent need of your help, and you must hasten to give them the aid which has often been promised them. For, as the most of you have heard, the Turks and Arabs have attacked them and have conquered the territory of Romania [the Greek empire] as far west as the shore of the Mediterranean and the Hellespont, which is called the Arm of St. George. They have occupied more and more of the lands of those Christians, and have overcome them in seven battles. They have killed and captured many, and have destroyed the churches and devastated the empire. If you permit them to continue thus for awhile with impurity, the faithful of God will be much more widely attacked by them. On this account I, or rather the Lord, beseech you as Christ's heralds to publish this everywhere and to persuade all people of whatever rank, foot-soldiers and knights, poor and rich, to carry aid promptly to those Christians and to destroy that vile race from the lands of our friends. I say this to those who are present, it meant also for those who are absent. Moreover, Christ commands it, God wills it, and the righteous will find eternal bounty.\n\nSo I sell my hut, abandon my wife, and travel over the mountains towards Milan.

They were  currently invading Spain, France, and Turkey when the Byzantine emperor begged for assistance from the Pope in the liberation of the Christians and Jews in Jerusalem. Thus began the crusades. ", "id": "d46zpkl"}, {"comment": "Yeah... except the Catholics were just as interested in screwing over the Orthodox Christians as they were in reclaiming land for Christianity. They wanted to take the Holy Land so they would be under Catholic kingdoms instead of reclaimed by the Byzantines. The fourth crusade saw the sacking of Constantinople and weakened the Byzantines to the point were they could be easily taken by the Ottomans. The church (and elites in Italy) in many ways abused the zealotry of European lords to further greater Catholic political goals and exert Catholic hegemony over the Orthodoxy.  \nAlso there are a shit load of crusades that everyone seems to forget about in eastern Europe which were very much an unprovoked  invasion by Catholics to destroy the pagan peoples that lived there. The Tutonic Knights wiped the old Prussians off the face of the earth. Furthermore, there was a tendency for lords and Kings to have other Catholics excommunicated so they could launch crusades for obvious personal and political gain. Bad things happened when you asked crusader orders for help. The Polish and Byzantines learned that the hard way.\nIllustrating the Muslims as peaceful victims in the crusades is clearly wrong. The Seljuks posed a distinct threat to the Byzantines (who are probably the most tragic figure of the conflict) but depicting the Catholics as benevolent liberators is glaringly incorrect. There are no good guys in the crusades.\nBesides, if your goal is to defame Muslims, focusing on pre-wahabist history is probably a bad way to go. They had far greater religious freedom than most of the Christian nations. Judaism was illegal in England until 1656, yet under most Islamic governments it was at least legally tolerated  (provided they payed additional taxes). Their systems of government also allowed for a degree of social mobility. While the Ottomans were incredibly aggressive in their expansion, you would have a hard time finding anyone besides the Swiss that weren't at that time. It's really after the spread of Wahabism that Islam becomes comparatively barbaric. The simultaneous conservative reaction to the  death of the Ottomans meant that Arabs were becoming more radically religious while not being exposed to the enlightenment. From there they have been failed by nationalism and have regressed even further into a toxic interpretation their religion.

The country is split in 2 opposing sides who cannot agree on another and generally mostly rather uneducated people (e.g. o-levels and below) or conservatives are against refugees. As this means around 50% of citizens are for refugees and the other half against, it will be almost impossible to find a solution. I agree that anyone who commits to crime should be either imprisoned or as it comes to refugees, be sent back to their home countries and sentenced there. But also as a philanthropist i think you should help as many humans as you can. German media fails to educate people about refugees and their struggles. Humans are afraid of what they don't know and that is why some are so hateful against refugees. It leads to a never-ending-circle as refugees have generally no perspective in european countries if they aren't really well educated. They fail to integrate in society and can't get a job, because they can't speak german/have no work permission/whatever. Most refugees have no social interactions with germans at all excluding social workers/police/whatever and get no chance to integrate in our society hence leading to them commiting to crime trying to make a living and building own social groups where they feel familiar. It has always been a problem of our country ever since the 2nd world war and im really sad that the people in my country haven't learned from the past.

How is a small a group of men and boys (since most were the age of around 14/15) at all representative of the one million refugees who entered Germany? Is the German man who kidnapped the little refugee boy a couple months ago representative of Germans as whole?  Should we let the refugees know that anytime they see a German man he's probably some pedophile who wants to snatch their little boy? \n\nIn fact, Germany isn't exactly a utopian society that never had rape cases before. \nThere's always reports of rape cases at things like Karneval in February and Oktoberfest in Munich. I'm not saying that rapes are impossible at the hands of refugees. But I am saying it's easy for scapegoating to happen at a large scale and it's really scary to see as someone who lives in Germany. History seems to be repeating itself. Are refugees the new Jews in Germany? This is exactly how it begins. Except Adolf goes by Pegida. \n\nGermany needs to take preventive measures to ensure that they can integrate these people into German society as much as possible. Education, learning the language, job opportunities and better living conditions. Alienating them, labeling them, etc. will do nothing but cause issues similar to what happened on New Years (mugging, rape, assaults, increased tensions, nationals leaving to fight for terrorist groups). \n\nI feel like German citizens now look to France and see the attacks that took place and they wonder if they're next. Well, maybe they should look at where France went wrong.

It is a big problem especially in 3rd world countries and a major problem witnessed is many women never say anything, even though we know rape is happening few are being reported and even fewer people are being punished for this. When women do not say anything, it is easier for people to ignore the problem. \"I do not know what rape is like, so no way for me to associate and sympathise with the victims.\" And since rape is soooooo taboo, very few people will actively discuss it and not understanding the results of rape perpetuate this ignorance of the problem (which is a significant one by the way). \n\nWhen rape victims come up and talk about rape, we at once realize how vile and despicable it is, and feel passionately compelled to do something about it. Now, I mean even before you might have wanted to do something about it, of course you do not need to hear a rape victim to know that rape is bad, however I think that hearing it from victim's mouths definitely make you waaaaay more sensitive and passionate about the topic. And like you said we are just encouraging them, they can tell it anonymously if they want, but starting the conversation is the first step to change. \n\nAnother thing, I think you are also maybe blowing the encouragement given to these victims to speak a bit out of proportions. I don't think victims are greatly encouraged to talk about being raped, like there is no societal stigma on not talking about being raped. If a rape victim does not want to talk about being raped, they are left alone. It is a gentle encouragement, and not one to fuss about like you seem to be doing. \n\nHope Reddit did not make you scared about asking questions.

Heydrich was a mass murdering cunt but at least he wasn't a caricature like the rest of the party. \n\n\nThe US government is as bad as the Nazi one? Which universe do you live in? Sure if you were a white Christian you'd be fine, actually no if you were a white Christian Pole you'd be sent to Auschwitz, same applies for any slav, Slavs were victims of the holocaust just like the Jews. So yeah, \"we wouldn't be any worse off\", as long as you live you're okay with millions of Eastern Europeans being murdered? Also, the US government had been supplying the UK with tons of weaponry before entering the war, the government was not pro-German by any means, not to mention embargoing Japan before their attack on Pearl Harbour.\n\n\nYes the American genocide of the natives is just as bad, in fact the nazis wanted to do the same to the Russians and Polish, but unlike nazis we don't celebrate genocide and recognize that many native Americans now live in poverty and third world enclaves.

The situation in germany is far more complex than many think. The country is split in 2 opposing sides who cannot agree on another and generally mostly rather uneducated people (e.g. o-levels and below) or conservatives are against refugees. As this means around 50% of citizens are for refugees and the other half against, it will be almost impossible to find a solution. I agree that anyone who commits to crime should be either imprisoned or as it comes to refugees, be sent back to their home countries and sentenced there. But also as a philanthropist i think you should help as many humans as you can. German media fails to educate people about refugees and their struggles. Humans are afraid of what they don't know and that is why some are so hateful against refugees. It leads to a never-ending-circle as refugees have generally no perspective in european countries if they aren't really well educated. They fail to integrate in society and can't get a job, because they can't speak german/have no work permission/whatever. Most refugees have no social interactions with germans at all excluding social workers/police/whatever and get no chance to integrate in our society hence leading to them commiting to crime trying to make a living and building own social groups where they feel familiar. It has always been a problem of our country ever since the 2nd world war and im really sad that the people in my country haven't learned from the past. I can't blame them since noone is perfected, but they seem to prefer digging their own grave just as many other countries are doing these days by giving extremists on every side more room to argue and recruit new followers (Hi ISIS).

How is a small a group of men and boys (since most were the age of around 14/15) at all representative of the one million refugees who entered Germany? Is the German man who kidnapped the little refugee boy a couple months ago representative of Germans as whole?  Should we let the refugees know that anytime they see a German man he's probably some pedophile who wants to snatch their little boy? \n\nIn fact, Germany isn't exactly a utopian society that never had rape cases before. \nThere's always reports of rape cases at things like Karneval in February and Oktoberfest in Munich. I'm not saying that rapes are impossible at the hands of refugees. But I am saying it's easy for scapegoating to happen at a large scale and it's really scary to see as someone who lives in Germany. History seems to be repeating itself. Are refugees the new Jews in Germany? This is exactly how it begins. Except Adolf goes by Pegida. \n\nGermany needs to take preventive measures to ensure that they can integrate these people into German society as much as possible. Education, learning the language, job opportunities and better living conditions. Alienating them, labeling them, etc. will do nothing but cause issues similar to what happened on New Years (mugging, rape, assaults, increased tensions, nationals leaving to fight for terrorist groups). \n\nI feel like German citizens now look to France and see the attacks that took place and they wonder if they're next. Well, maybe they should look at where France went wrong. Namely, speaking up about the fact that  France largely treated/treats their Arabs like one big, giant burden and its affect finally began to show after decades of largely ignored social issues. \n\nWhy does the US have so few home-grown Muslim terrorists? American Muslims are actually pretty equal to the rest of Americans. They aren't known as \"rapists\". They aren't really in gangs or considered criminals. \n\nThis doesn't seem to be the case in a lot of European countries. Especially France and now, Germany. If we continue on this track, we'll basically be a helping hand in the resentment that fuels the rapes, the terrorist attacks, the IS lovers, the gangs and the reverting back to a religion in its most extreme form.

But India has a massive population and no such firewall...\n\nSit back and let me tell you my story with Indian spammers. Sometime last year, me and my best friend (whom I had grown up with and did everything with over the last 20+ years) went out to a classy joint with our girlfriends. Afterwards, we were going to go see a movie and hopefully get lucky. Something was up with my best friend because he was sweating profusely and his eyes were darting around. I thought he was going to propose to his girlfriend at first but I knew that couldn't happen since he would have told me about it beforehand. We were virtually brothers. \n\nSo anyways, I see he's getting more nervous by the minute and finally he asked to talk to me alone. We step outside for a cigarette (I still smoked, he had quit a couple years ago) and before I could get a word out, he asks me about \"having problems getting it up\". I was like, \"you mean erectile dysfunction? He said yeah. I'm like, uh, I don't have any problems with that. He kinda looked disappointed which was weird, but then pulls out some blue pills and glances at me to see my reaction. I did always want to try viagara just once to see what it was all about. I laughed and I said he should give me one. He asked me if I wanted to buy a few from him. Normally he would have just given them to me free, being like brothers, but apparently he overpaid for them or something I dunno.  So I said fuck it and gave him some cash and then we proceed to walk back into the restaurant. I sit down and turn around and he's gone. Completely vanished. I look at the table and his girlfriend was gone. My wife said she got up and left 5 minutes ago. That was the last time I ever saw Rakesh.

Am I mistaken?\n\nEdit: I'm dead wrong on this.  From the relevant Wikipedia article:\n\nDiagnosis[edit]\nThe American Psychiatric Association permits a diagnosis of gender dysphoria if the criteria in the DSM-5, are met. The DSM-5 moved this diagnosis out of the sexual disorders category and into a category of its own.[32] The DSM-5 states that at least two of the criteria for gender dysphoria must be experienced for at least six months' duration in adolescents or adults for diagnosis.[33] The diagnosis was renamed from \"Gender Identity Disorder\" to \"Gender Dysphoria\", after criticisms that the former term was stigmatizing.[34] Subtyping by sexual orientation was deleted. The diagnosis for children was separated from that for adults, as \"gender dysphoria in children\" or \"gender identity disorder in children\" (GIDC). The creation of a specific diagnosis for children reflects the lesser ability of children to have insight into what they are experiencing, or ability to express it in the event that they have insight.[35]\n\nThe International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) list three diagnostic criteria for \"transsexualism\" (F64.0):[12] Uncertainty about gender identity which causes anxiety or stress is diagnosed as sexual maturation disorder, according to the ICD-10.[36]", "id": "d4i21rk"}, {"comment": "Im actually quite ok with not being drafted to fight side by side with this person.

This means that \"Tom\" was born a \"male\" however, he was *assigned* the \"gender\" (not sex because apparently they're noy the same) of a \"boy\" at birth by his parents. \"Tom\" *feels* that he has the gender of a \"girl\". Therefore, it's not his fault but his parents' and society's for bringing him up like a \"boy\" just because he has a penis and not letting \"Tom\" decide his \"gender\". \"Tom\" gets a sex change to change from a \"male\" to a \"female\" (which defeats the concept that gender is a \"social construct\") to become more like a \"girl\" (which apparently does not mean that female=girl therefore gender=sex but never mind, SJWs are always right). This helps him cope with many psychological disorders that he's developed due to him *feeling* like a \"girl\".  \n  \nI'm not an expert on it at all but here is all I know about it:  \n  \n\"Tom\" has \"gender dysphoria\" which is a physiological disorder which results in psychological disorders. \"Tom's\" *feelings* don't mean jack shit. When \"Tom\" was developing in the womb, he got the \"XY\" chromosomes making him a \"male\" physically (all fetuses start as female). However, he didn't gain the necessory hormones or had a hormone imbalance of male/female hormones to make his brain develop like a \"male\" therefore his body was \"male\" but his brain was \"female\". This makes him feel more like \"girls\" who are raised in a particular way because he identifies more with them because they have a \"female\" brain and are raised like \"girls\" because of it. He too wants to be a \"girl\" because he has a \"female\" brain. Therefore, he gets a sex change to look more like a \"female\" so he can feel that his \"female\" brain aligns with his \"female\" body so he can be a \"girl\" - again defeating the notion that gender is a social construct.", "id": "d4hqc4b"}, {"comment": "What the fuck... someone just do us a favor and kill \"Tom\".", "id": "d4i2fo3"}, {"comment": "Since long ago, some people have avoided drafts by proving they were a \"conscientious objector\" to the conflict or war in general.

Because putting a little warning on your webpage is practically free, so why not? You might even get some idiots on the internet to defend and advertise your brand name for free.

The Nazi party twisted this into basically stating that for the German people to thrive, they needed to reconquer all territory lost in World War I and more.\n\nThat additional territory they had in mind would be conquered by exterminating the subhuman Slavic people and taking their land.\n\nAlong the same lines, for the German people to thrive it would need to be a strong and healthy people. Which sounds great until you realise they weren't talking about better healthcare but getting rid of those described as 'unworthy for life'. Which was basically a catchall for the mentally and physically disabled. Including people like homosexuals.\n\nIn the end, Jews made up about half of the people processed in concentration camps.

He describes a crowd applauding for Stalin where nobody wanted to be the first to stop for fear of being arrested.\n\n> At the conclusion of the conference, a tribute to Comrade Stalin was called for. Of course, everyone stood up (just as everyone had leaped to his feet during the conference at every mention of his name). ... For three minutes, four minutes, five minutes, the stormy applause, rising to an ovation, continued. But palms were getting sore and raised arms were already aching. And the older people were panting from exhaustion. It was becoming insufferably silly even to those who really adored Stalin.\n\n> However, who would dare to be the first to stop? \u2026 After all, NKVD men were standing in the hall applauding and watching to see who would quit first! And in the obscure, small hall, unknown to the leader, the applause went on \u2013 six, seven, eight minutes! They were done for! Their goose was cooked! They couldn\u2019t stop now till they collapsed with heart attacks! At the rear of the hall, which was crowded, they could of course cheat a bit, clap less frequently, less vigorously, not so eagerly \u2013 but up there with the presidium where everyone could see them?\n\n> The director of the local paper factory, an independent and strong-minded man, stood with the presidium. Aware of all the falsity and all the impossibility of the situation, he still kept on applauding! Nine minutes! Ten!

An introvert isn't necessarily afraid of social interaction, it just wears them down.

Inserting Accented Characters with an English Keyboard Layout\n\nIf you only need an accented character every now and then, there is no need to change your full keyboard layout.\n\nFor all PCs\n\nThere are several key combinations you can use to insert single characters into your text on a PC. The first is for newer computers using the Control key and may only work in Microsoft Office.\n\nIn Office for Windows: For accented vowles: Press Ctrl + \u2018, then the vowel (ctrl + ' + a = \u00e1)\n\nFor \u00d1: Press Ctrl + ~, then the letter n (ctrl + ~ + n = \u00f1)\n\nThe second way is using the ASCII code. Each character in your computer has a code made up of pressing the ALT key then a three-digit number, all of which are listed below.\n\n\u00e1 = Alt + 0225\n\n\u00e9 = Alt + 0233\n\n\u00ed = Alt + 0237\n\n\u00f3 = Alt + 0243\n\n\u00fa = Alt + 0250\n\n\u00f1 = Alt + 0241\n\n\u00fc = Alt + 0252\n\n\u00a1 = Alt + 0161\n\n\u00bf = Alt + 0191\n\nTo type the numbers, you must use the numeric keypad on the right side of your keyboard, not the number keys on the top row.\n\nFor all Macs\n\nTo get accented vowels on a Mac, hold down the Option key, and while holding it down, type the letter e; then release those keys and type the letter that you want the accent to appear on:\n\nOpt + e, then a = \u00e1\n\nOpt + e, then e = \u00e9\n\nOpt + e, then i = \u00ed\n\nOpt + e, then o = \u00f3\n\nOpt + e, then u = \u00fa\n\nFor the \u00f1, hold down the Option key while you type the n, then type n again.\n\nOpt + n, then n = \u00f1\n\nTo type an umlaut over the u, hold down the Option key while pressing the u key then type u again.\n\nOpt + u, then u = \u00fc\n\n*To type the upside-down punctuation marks press the following keys all at once.\n\nOpt + 1 = \u00a1\n\nOpt + shift + ? = \u00bf\n\n2. Full Keyboard Configuration\n\nFor those using Spanish letters and punctuation on a regular basis, I recommend going into your Control Panel/System Preferences and add the Spanish keyboard configuration. This will mean you need to learn the new key placements, but it is very easy once you get used to it.\n\nFor Windows Vista\n\nGo to your Control Panel\nClick on \"Clock, Language, Region\nClick on \"Change Keyboards\"\nClick \"Add\" and Select \"Spanish-International Sort\"\nFor Windows XP:\n\nGo to your Control Panel\nClick on \"Date, Time, Language, and Regional Options\"\nClick on \"Regional and Language Options\"\nSelect the \"Languages\" tab at the top\nClick on \"Details\" near the bottom\nClick \"Add\" and choose \"Spanish-Traditional Sort\"\nGo back to the \"Languages\" tab and choose the option to \"switch languages\" by pressing \"left alt-shift\" at the same time. This way, you can switch to and from the Spanish and regular keyboard whenever you want.\nFor Macs\n\nGo to your System Preferences\nClick on \"International\"\nSelect the \"Input Menu\" tab\nScroll down to select \"Spanish - ISO\"\nNote the keystrokes necessary to switch between languages OR Select \"Show input menu in menu bar\" to be able to click-select which keyboard you want to use.\nSpanish-International Sort Keyboard Layout\n\nSpanish-International Sort Keyboard Key Strokes\n\n' + a = \u00e1\n\n' + e = \u00e9\n\n' + i = \u00ed\n\n' + o = \u00f3\n\n' + u = \u00fa\n\n\" + u = \u00fc\n\nOnce you have installed your Spanish keyboard, it will react slightly differently than you are used to. First, you will notice that when you type an apostrophe ( ' ), nothing happens. This is because if you type a vowel immediately after, you will get an accented vowel (\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa). To get an apostrophe, push the key for the hyphen, next to the number 0.

Mitch Daniels was liked because he focused almost exclusively on the economy and government efficiency. He gave no fucks about social issues, and it was implied that Pence, as the successor of Daniels, would set aside the social dogmas that he was known for and govern a state that was on a very good path, economically, after Mitch Daniels' two terms.\n\n>He didn't do that. \n\n>From day one, Pence didn't govern--he played national GOP politics. Whatever the big firey debate of the day was among the national GOP, he grabbed ahold of it and pretended to be its conservative crusader, even if it had absolutely zero relevance to the state of Indiana. He spent time, money, and resources on championing issues that Hoosiers didn't care about or didn't support, because he wanted to pander to the National GOP's ultra conservative base for his future career. Essentially, he was using Indiana as a stepping stone. He never cared about being governor. He always had higher aspirations, and the governorship was a stepping stone to a higher federal office. Most Hoosiers, left or right on the political spectrum, espouse this opinion about him.\n\n>As I said before, Mitch Daniels literally gave no fucks about social issues. Indiana is generally a conservative state, but it's never been a state particularly hung up on social issues, and it's never been a state that follows the national GOP's social platform. Indiana has, for as long as I've been alive, been a business Republican state--politicians like the Bushes, Mitt Romney, etc. We voted Obama into office, and prior to Mitch Daniels in 2005, we had 16 straight years of Democratic governorship. Indianapolis, the capital and largest city in the state, routinely switched between Republican and Democrat mayors, and it has managed to have long-term plans and continue its momentum regardless of which party is in office.\n\n>So Pence, with his national conservative GOP politics, has been an aberration that has directly harmed Indiana's image and its pocket book. \n\n>In the three years since Pence took office, he:\n\n>* Pushed through legislation making harsher penalties for drug crimes against the protests of numerous major legal organizations including the Indiana Bar Association, as well as most Hoosiers\n\n>* Inherited a phenomenal state balance sheet from Mitch Daniels and used it as an excuse to push tax cuts so extreme (would have caused a tremendous deficit) that the Republican-controlled Congress shut him down\n\n>* Tried and failed to amend the Indiana constitution to ban gay marriage, despite widespread polling that showed that Hoosiers didn't support it, and despite the vociferous condemnation of virtually every major business in the state\n\n>* Since his gay marriage amendment failed, he literally, as payback (not exaggerating, the signing ceremony was invite only, no media was allowed or invited, but someone leaked a picture that showed Pence surrounded by well-known anti-LGBT extremists), came back with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was a genuine political circus. It humiliated Indiana on the national stage, directly harmed Indianapolis, and was met with, perhaps, the fiercest backlash by the people of any state in the Union. The extraordinary protests of Hoosiers and businesses allowed the state GOP leaders to basically coerce--to his visible chagrin--Pence to amend the law and \"fix it\" (this was actually the [front page](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/03/31/indy_star_fix_this_now_1427838279029_15914269_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) of the biggest newspaper in Indiana). \n\n>* The RFRA was such a debacle that Pence ended up hiring an expensive out-of-state public relations firm to heal Indiana's national image. He couldn't answer why he chose an out-of-state firm. He couldn't answer why he chose such an expensive firm, when there are many firms in Indiana that could have done the job. It was eventually canceled, and was yet another waste of taxpayer money. To date, the RFRA has cost Indianapolis (a city that fought against it, changed the official tourism website to rainbow colors, and hung a huge rainbow banner at the airport) $60 million, and the total cost--to the economy and reputation--to the rest of the state is unknown. \n\n>* During the gay marriage supreme court fight, he literally sent the Indiana attorney general to *other states* to advise them on how to craft their laws and fight gay marriage nationally. He did this on the taxpayer dollar. He continued to spend taxpayer money fighting gay marriage in the courts and with lawsuits despite, at the time, everyone knowing what the Supreme Court decision was going to be. It was basically a political stand by Pence; an expensive political stand that Hoosiers didn't support.\n\n>* He has acted like a strongman (think Turkey's Erdo\u011fan), doing everything in his power to make Glenda Ritz, the state superintendent **and an elected official**, quit her job, and barring that, stripping her of the power given to her by the Indiana constitute and the Hoosiers that elected her through backroom deals, conspiracy, and highly technical legal challenges. Just Google \"Mike Pence Glenda Ritz.\" You could write a thesis on it. \n\n>* Everyone, literally everyone, was on board for receiving a *huge* federal grant for preschool funding. The Indiana Department of Education was literally in the final stages of the application process--and the federal government was happy with Indiana and going to give us an especially large chunk of money--when Pence came in and shut it down for no reason because accepting money from the feds became politically untenable among the national GOP tea partier crowd. And, of course, you can't be elected president--Pence's eyes were always on the future--without support from the GOP's far right base. After shutting down the process, he has recently been opining that it would be a good idea to get federal money to fund preschools... A year after he shit all over the Dept of Education's proposal to do just that. \n\n>* The HIV epidemic in southern Indiana is out of control and among the worst in the country. Of course, we could provide free needles for heroin addicts like has been done in many states to curb HIV problems, but that is politically repugnant to Mike Pence. He also managed to get the Planned Parenthoods in that part of the state shut down, eliminating the opportunity for poor people to get tested. The HIV epidemic, which never had to be an epidemic, continues, and Pence gets to push the problem on our future governor as he goes to join Trump on the national stage. \n\n>* Speaking of Planned Parenthood, Pence is highly proud of his accomplishment at passing the single most restrictive abortion law since Roe vs Wade. The law, HEA 1337 is far stricter than anything even in the Deep South and is almost certainly unconstitutional. He knows that it's probably unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Indiana taxpayers will spend millions of dollars for our attorney general to fight the law all the way to the Supreme Court, just so Pence could make his political statement. \n\n>* He literally tried to make a state-run news agency that he would then give exclusive interviews and access to. I don't even know if that's legal, but he tried to do it and was promptly crucified by the media and even his own party. \n\n>* He asserted authority to ban Syrian refugees from being settled in Indiana. He has no authority. No governor has. He knew that, but he was planning to be a GOP presidential candidate, and he needed to show that he was strong and anti-Muslim refugee to appease the national GOP base. He took leadership role in this discriminatory crusade, appearing on national TV to preach his ignorance. This particular event managed to throw multiple refugee settlement organizations into disarray--which, by the way, actually include the Catholic Church of Indiana (the arch bishop of Indianapolis publicly criticized the governor)--and several Syrian refugees which were well into the process of moving to Indiana had to be relocated to another state. Pence didn't back down until the courts affirmed that his order was unconstitutional.\n\n>* He shut down a highly successful energy efficiency program--one of the first in the nation, making Indiana a trailblazer--initiated by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission\u00a0with the support of previous governor Mitch Daniels. He did this for no good reason, other than to signal to his far-right constituents that he was fighting against Obama's evil despotic EPA. \n\n>This is all just in his three years in office. He is reviled across the state, and especially so in Indianapolis. There is (was--now that he's the VP nominee, he can no longer be governor) a bipartisan *Pence Must Go* campaign to get rid of him, and there are literally [billboards](http://media1.fdncms.com/nuvo/imager/u/original/3821872/pmg_billboard.jpg) and [yard signs](http://media.theindychannel.com/photo/2015/04/17/16x9/_Fire_Pence__signs_go_up_after_RFRA_2839710000_16967639_ver1.0_640_480.jpg) plastered all over the city. Pence is, by virtually all objective measures, one of the worst governors in recent Indiana history, at least in terms of working for the benefit of the state. He has basically focused on far-right Christian social conservative interests to the clear detriment of all else, most importantly the current and future well-being of the state's reputation and economy.

If only I had any writing talent.\n\nEdit: Here's what I came up with.\n\n\n***\n\n***\n\nStonehenge. Machu Picchu. Giza.\n\n\nFor millennia these areas were left undamaged by humans, even while the forests and oceans were ravaged by industry and global war machines, these places held sway over the minds of all who would do harm. Groups rose up in their protection, like zealots to their temples, but for what reason they didn't know. The Conservation Authority was at the forefront against those who attempted to destroy these sacred monuments.\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't until the Russian Federation, in another attempt to gain control of the Middle East, firebombed Cairo. It was like a light flipped on overnight. The Conservation Authority immediately focused on damage control, their leaders spending weeks pleading to the U.N. for ground support, but everywhere else people were awaking with renewed vigor and clarity. It wasn't until a group of vandals destroyed Stonehenge that researchers began looking into this feeling, what was originally thought to be some form of mass hysteria, that spread to the world's population faster than any pandemic. The Conservation Authority focused all it's resources to protecting the last sacred site, Machu Picchu. \n\n***\n\n\n\n\nIn a blow the Conservation Authority could never have planned for, the surrounding fault lines tore the city asunder. Over half of the conservationists died in the initial quake with barely a quarter making it out at all. It was Machu Picchu's destruction that heralded the Authority's demise. The planet woke up at once to it's destruction and knew the Authority's true objective.\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time in humanity's history people were able to unify, not as a tribe or nation, but as a common people. The Authority's leaders attempted to board their ships when Machu Picchu fell, but they were headed off by U.N. forces. It was then that they learned what was being held in Giza, Stonehenge, and Machu Picchu. The Orbs of Obfuscation. These devices sent out signals imperceptible to even the finest instrument humanity created. The signals clouded the minds of men and made them greedy and selfish. Even just one was enough to maintain tentative control over the planet.\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nThe Orbs were crafted by the Orion Alliance, a group of interstellar species that feared what humanity would accomplish. Humans had advanced technologically to a point in 9,000 years that took even the greatest of the Orion Alliance 10 million years. With their rapid growth the Alliance took matters into their own hands and crafted the Orbs.\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nThe Orbs were created as a means of slowing the progress of humanity and the Alliance began placing them in areas that humans regarded as sacred. This would assure that the Orbs would remain untouched. But still the march of progress went on. Even though they were hindered by the Alliance and their Orbs, in less than 15,000 years of their first civilization they achieved the ability of space travel. And now they know they were held back. The Alliance readied themselves for an assault on Earth as a last ditch plan to hold their control of the Orion Arm. They amassed a fleet of over 10 billion soldiers and set their course for the human homeworld. \n\n***\n\n\n\n\nAn unintended side-effect of the Orbs was that they made the humans warmongers, so much so that they even attacked and killed their own kind over made up ideas. None of the Alliance races could stand up to the overwhelming might of humanity. They had superior numbers, orders of magnitude more than the humans could muster, but in those 15,000 years humanity honed their killing edge; they made bigger and more destructive weapons than any Alliance race had ever seen.\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nIt didn't even take them a week to annihilate the Alliance's army; the first battle alone was over in seconds. Human researchers began reverse engineering interstellar travel from the remnants of the Alliance vessels. It was only a matter of time before they built their fleet and launched a counter attack directly for the Alliance homeworlds. The Alliance races fled to their homeworlds in an attempt to protect themselves.\n\n***\n\n\n\n\nAfter fifty years of research and development humanity completed it's starfleet, a mere 10,000 ships.

A fascist is a radical authoritarian leader of a country who subjugates citizens under absolute rule. Committing, or advocating for, war crimes doesn't make you a fascist in any way - Bin Laden for example isn't a fascist despite being a war criminal.\n\n>Nothing about the \"muslim database\"\n\nThere isn't a \"muslim database\", what was considered was a database for people who met certain criteria (like being syrian refugees) coming into the united states. These already exist all throughout the world and aren't inherently \"fascism\". There's an accounting for Syrian refugees entering into Germany and the like, it's not fascism when they create such a system. You'll have to explain what Trump wants and how this turns him into a fascist under the above definition.\n\n>advocating totalitarian rule\n\nI'm not giving a bunch of these turgid 'journalism' outlets views or listening to their propaganda. I'm more than happy to watch interviews of what Trump actually said and then assess whether I A. find it 'deplorable' and B. think it represents fascism, but I won't suckle on the teat of organisations engaged in purposeful misinformation.\n\n> endorsements from Kim Jong-Un, Omar Mateen, the KKK, various Neonazi leaders worldwide, and Putin\n\n\nWhich mean nothing. You aren't defined by the people who support you but your own actions and words, and its pathetic and small of you and my fellows on the left to pretend that its in some way meaningful or indicative of the individual that 'bad people' support them. The most disgusting individual imaginable could support you or one of your messages right now, and it wouldn't make your statement or argument any less valid or true, and you know it, but you'll fling this shit like its at all meaningful out when its someone you disagree with.\n\n>antisemitic tweets\n\nThis also makes you look like a fuckin moron. He used a generic shape on a fairly standard political image, and suddenly the start is a \"star of david\" and \"he meant it in some sinister bigoted way that was antisemitic\". This is the pathetic shit that left you with an orange tanned orangutan buffoon for a president, going off topic with this utter bullshit instead of sticking to the facts. Trump's said so much legitimately questionable stuff, what kind of idiot resorts to  aspersions based on pure speculation.\n\n>a bunch more links to partisan gobbledegook\n\nAgain, not interested. I'm not reading some partisan, unethical hack's opinion of what Donald Trump said, more than happy to actually look at his statement and, if its repugnant as a number of things he's said have been, criticise it, but i have no faith in the mainstream media to accurately represent anyone's views.\n\n>advocating violence at his rallies,\n\nNone of this shit makes him a fascist. Saying \"that guys an idiot someone should beat him up\" doesn't make you a fascist, I know you wish it did, but words have meanings and this ain't it.\n\n>supporters calling for the lynching of a black man while chanting seig heil at a rally (guess whether he condemned it\n\nAgain, doesn't mean anything. I just threw a puppy into oncoming traffic on a highway in your name, now you're a bad person and nothing you say is legitimate. Guess you lose the argument, right? Right?\n\nCongratulations on electing Donald Trump though. It's exactly the ridiculous SJW, reality divergent behaviour you're exhibiting here that sent millions of people who voted for Obama to Trump because they were sick of your shit. Trump's not a good candidate, theres plenty there to criticise, if you, the mainstream media and Hillary had bothered talking about that, rather than just throwing the most toxic, stigmatised and hyperbolic labels you could possibly think of at him the election might have had a different outcome, although it wouldn't lead to Hillary winning.\n\nHad she won she, ironically, would have been an actual dictator, given her attempts to circumvent the democratic process and her utter and complete control over the establishment and the mainstream media.

If you read the life history of the Prophet (pbuh), only two of his marriages one with Khadija (ra), and the other, with Ayesha (ra) were marriages in the normal course. All his other marriages were contracted as a necessity and were based on various considerations.\n\nThe first marriage of the Prophet (pbuh) took place when he was 25 years of age and he married Khadija (ra) who was twice widowed, and was 40 years old. If the Prophet (pbuh) was hyper-sexual, why would he marry a woman who was 15 years older than him and already twice widowed?\n\nUntil his first wife, Khadija (ra) was alive, he never took a second wife. Khadija (ra) died when the Prophet (pbuh) was 50 years age and only after this, did he marry the others. If he married eleven wives for sexual reasons, he should have had multiple wives during his youth. Contrary to this, history tells us that all his marriages with his remaining ten wives took place when he was between the age of 53 AND 59 YEARS.\n\nAll his wives (ra) were between the age of 36 to 50 years, except for two wives (ra). His reputation had spread far and wide, not only in Arabia, but also in the neighboring countries. Could he not have easily got younger and lovelier girls to marry? Most of his marriages were for political gain and for the spread of Islam.\n\nIn Arabia, no one could carry on the work of reform and uplifting unless he belonged to, or was related to some specific and respectable tribe. Thus, in the interest of his mission, the Prophet (pbuh) needed inter-tribal relationships. He wanted to weld the quarreling tribal and clannish factions into one Muslim body, as brethren in faith (Ikhwan fi\u2019d-din).\n\nFor instance, his wife Juwayreeyah (ra) belonged to the Banu Mustaliq clan, which was very powerful. The entire clan was a bitter enemy of Islam from the start, and they were finally suppressed by military action. When the Prophet (pbuh) married Juwayreeyah (ra), the Muslims released all their prisoners, saying that they could not keep the prophet\u2019s relatives in bondage. It was due to this marriage that the whole clan of Banu Mustaliq accepted Islam and became peaceful and obedient to the laws of the new Islaamic state.\n\nMaymunah (ra) also came from a very powerful and recalcitrant clan from Najd and was the sister of the wife of the chief of the clan in those days. It was this clan which had brutally murdered seventy members of an Islaamic missionary deputation. The Prophet\u2019s (pbuh) marriage with Maymunah (ra) changed the whole atmosphere and Najd accepted Madinah\u2019s authority under the leadership of the Prophet (pbuh).\n\n"], [0, "From the thumbnail I thought it was going to be about Christmas trees somehow."], [-1, "[deleted]"], [0, "How do you get a retard button, can i have a retard button?"], [0, "Okay now that did make me curious - how are the toilet signs in Arab countries?"], [-1, "http://irregulartimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/dollarpyramid.jpg\n\nCoincidence ?

The Prophet\u2019s (pbuh) marriage with Maymunah (ra) changed the whole atmosphere and Najd accepted Madinah\u2019s authority under the leadership of the Prophet (pbuh).\n\n", "id": "cxviz68"}], [{"comment": "From the thumbnail I thought it was going to be about Christmas trees somehow.", "id": "cxv0ct0"}, {"comment": "Hipster Saudi Arabia - waging war on Christmas before it was cool", "id": "cxv0vpd"}], [{"comment": "[deleted]", "id": "cxv0ehb"}, {"comment": "Sand box", "id": "cxv1fsi"}], [{"comment": "How do you get a retard button, can i have a retard button?", "id": "cxv3l3v"}], [{"comment": "Okay now that did make me curious - how are the toilet signs in Arab countries?", "id": "cxv7lfb"}, {"comment": "Just like the signs all over (female = figure with skirt, male = figure) oh but sometimes we don't have signs at all we would just have the lettering 'women' 'men'.

", "id": "cy13jkm"}, {"comment": ">stoning women for drivinrg\n\nThat has actually never happened. There are no laws per se that ban women from driving in Saudi Arabia, it's just a cultural thing and is frowned upon practice in this conservative society. It is not even enforced in rural areas. The thing is, women are not issued lisences in Saudi Arabia which is why it is essentially illegal for them to drive. Women caught driving is thus a traffic violation and is dealt with a fine. Not the death sentence. See, this is the example of misinformation that breeds through cartoons and memes. People are not interested in the truth anymore. \n\nAccording to a 2007 Gallup poll, 66% of Saudi women and 55% of Saudi men agreed that women should be allowed to drive. Moreover, that same poll found that more than 8 in 10 Saudi women (82%) and three-quarters of Saudi men (75%) agree that women should be allowed to hold any job for which they are qualified outside the home. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia). So you see, it's not like the whole country is full of bad people and saying \"Saudis are just bad people\" is demonstrably wrong because a lot of them according to polls want reform and want a more moderate and progressive society. Sure, the religious clergy is not interested in reform because they will lose legitmacy in the process and thus lose their power. Liberation is a slow process. Saudi King Abdullah said as much:\n\n\"I believe strongly in the rights of women. My mother is a woman. My sister is a woman. My daughter is a woman. My wife is a woman. I believe the day will come when women will drive. In fact if you look at the areas of Saudi Arabia, the desert, and in the rural areas, you will find that women do drive. The issue will require patience. In time I believe that it will be possible. I believe that patience is a virtue.\" [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20081022104153/http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/articles/2008/ioi/080806-walters-interview.html)", "id": "cy14a9w"}, {"comment": "Buddy, they stoned two women for driving past 8pm, wearinng make up, and partying.

He runs down the stairs of his home and bursts into his kitchen where he sees an 8 foot flame shooting up out of his garbage can. About half his kitchen burned down before the fire department arrived and the damage cost was over 50 thousand. The investigation showed that his back door was tampered with and someone broke the lock to enter his home, indicating foul play. The craziest part was yet to come though. About 3 days after the event he's staying at a hotel while repairs are being done on his home and he orders some room service. The food comes up to his room and he opens the tray. Inside he finds the meal he ordered, but to the right of the plate are 8 burned matches (previously lit). And you wanna know something about those matches. They were meticulously arranged in a pattern that specifically resembled 2 letters.... \"M. E.\" All I'm saying is be careful about what you post and the positions you take man. I'd hate to see another young memer wiped out, account wise or literally, trying to bet against memes.\n\n", "id": "da9kpi0"}, {"comment": "That's how you save money", "id": "da9cvld"}, {"comment": "Thats how you decide which one you like and then buy it.
