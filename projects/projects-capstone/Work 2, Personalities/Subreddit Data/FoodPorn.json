The use of creams in curries is a Kashmiri thing, and many of them immigrated to the UK and established this cuisine template, along with Punjabi migrants. \n\nQormas as had in southern Pakistan and central India is not as thick, uses yoghurt instead of cream and is much darker, taking its colour from dried deep fried red onions. \n\nFor those interested in some easy to cook recipes and can handle the spices at a desi level, check out Shan Masalas.

Specifically it looks (to a relatively minor degree) like the outside of the steak is a little overdone and the inside is a little underdone.\n\nThis \"temperature gradient\" that you would ideally minimize, is going to be a function of heat, time, and the thickness of the meat. If you're cooking a 2.5\" steak on a stovetop on the highest possible heat, you're going to get a steak that has a significant temperature gradient.\n\nThe way to get a piece of meat up to temperature, uniformly, is low heat. If you want your steak at 129 degrees (med rare) and put it in a 129 degree water bath, the meat won't get overdone anywhere because it doesn't even have a chance to go over 129. An oven set to 200 degrees or so achieves the same end.\n\nThis is the idea behind the reverse sear. You bring the meat up to temp slowly and uniformly, and then to finish it off you sear over high heat to get those delightful Maillard reactions.

Specifically it looks (to a relatively minor degree) like the outside of the steak is a little overdone and the inside is a little underdone.\n\nThis \"temperature gradient\" that you would ideally minimize, is going to be a function of heat, time, and the thickness of the meat. If you're cooking a 2.5\" steak on a stovetop on the highest possible heat, you're going to get a steak that has a significant temperature gradient.\n\nThe way to get a piece of meat up to temperature, uniformly, is low heat. If you want your steak at 129 degrees (med rare) and put it in a 129 degree water bath, the meat won't get overdone anywhere because it doesn't even have a chance to go over 129. An oven set to 200 degrees or so achieves the same end.\n\nThis is the idea behind the reverse sear. You bring the meat up to temp slowly and uniformly, and then to finish it off you sear over high heat to get those delightful Maillard reactions. The downside is that while you earn quality you sacrifice time. It'll take a good 2 hours to get your steak up to temp.

Use an [egg ring](http://rk.wsimgs.com/wsimgs/rk/images/dp/wcm/201625/0003/williams-sonoma-egg-rings-c.jpg).  The challenge is that an egg ring will force you to *really* cook an egg because it makes it thicker, so I usually take the ring off after a good 30-60 seconds.  Makes it slightly more compact but not too thick.  I see a crispy edge on the left (I think) so I suspect OP did something like this.  Alternately, use an [egg pan](https://www.ocado.com/productImages/719/71935011_1_640x640.jpg?identifier=88d95ba296d71df3a6a3875d12925b28).  They look silly but they're actually a great little tool- they keep the egg relatively compact while cooking and cleanup is a breeze.\n\n2. [Poach your eggs.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yppgDL0Mn3g)  It's one of those things that sounds really complex and difficult but in reality it's super easy.  For my money, poaching gives you the absolute best texture in the cooked egg as possible.\n\nWhile it's not what OP did, you also might enjoy baked eggs.  Make a hash, throw it in an oven-safe dish, crack some raw eggs on top, and throw the dish in the oven.  Take out of the oven and eat immediately.  [Final product looks like this.](http://www.janssushibar.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Sweet-Potato-Hash-with-Sausage-and-Baked-Eggs.jpg)  I know OP didn't do this because the eggs always need to bake on top of something else and they'll be irreversibly stuck to that thing when done.

You can eat it then if you want to, or you can put it in a container and stick it in the freezer at that point for hard serve later, which is what we did.\n\nI've heard that you can put the ice cream base in a container and put it in the freezer, remove it every 30 minutes or so, and scrape down the sides until it's all frozen through, but I haven't tried it. I'm sure there are tons of methods that are painstaking/time-consuming but work, but I recommend picking up a machine second-hand (most people who buy them seem to use them once or twice and then donate them to thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army) or investing in a relatively inexpensive new machine.", "id": "d50rd30"}, {"comment": "Interesting thank you..

Combine the apples, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, and vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the apples are slightly softened and have released their juices, about 5 minutes. Whisk together the water and cornstarch in a small bowl until a slurry forms. Pour into the apple mixture, stirring constantly, and increase the heat to high. Continue to stir and cook until the mixture thickens and the apples are softened to your desired consistency, about 3-6 more minutes. Stir in the lemon juice. Remove the filling mixture from the heat and set aside to cool.  \nAs the filling cools, prepare the dough. Add the flour to a large bowl. Use a dough blender or two knives to cut the butter into the flour until coarse crumbs form, no larger than a pea. In a small, separate bowl, beat together the eggs and the salt. Pour the hot milk (and make sure it's very hot!) slowly into the egg mixture while whisking constantly. It's important to do this slowly or else you'll wind up with scrambled eggs. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir until well-combined and the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.  \nLightly flour a flat surface and turn the dough out on top. Knead the dough until it's smooth, about 2-3 minutes.  \nCut the dough into 8 (for large) or 12 (for small) equal sized pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, smoothing them out as much as possible. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough out into thin circles.\nOne at a time, fill each dough circle with about 2 tablespoon's worth of the apple filling. Fold the dough circle in half over the filling, and press down on the edges to seal. Fold or crimp the edge, starting at one corner and continuing all the way to the end, to ensure that the pies stay closed while frying.  \nHeat the oil to 350\u00b0F in a deep cast iron pan, dutch oven, or wok. If you don't have a candy & oil thermometer, you can tell the oil is ready when bubbles rise to the surface around a wooden spoon handle inserted into the oil.  \nFry the pies, a couple at a time, until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side. You may find that you have to adjust your heat as you go, so keep an eye on how quickly they brown. Carefully remove the pies from the oil using tongs or a slotted spoon and set aside on a cooling rack placed over a baking sheet or paper towels.\nWhile the pies cool enough to handle, make the glaze. Place the butter in a medium-sized microwave-safe bowl. Cover the bowl with a paper plate and microwave on high for 3 minutes, and then in 15 second intervals if necessary, until deeply golden.  \nRemove browned butter from microwave and allow to cool slightly. Whisk in the brown sugar, maple syrup, and milk. Microwave again in 30 second intervals, whisking in between, until melted and smooth, about 2 minutes total.  \nWhisk in the vanilla extract and a cup of the powdered sugar. Add additional powdered sugar until the glaze is thick enough to brush onto the fry pies.  \nBrush the glaze onto the tops of the fry pies and let set. Drizzle with remaining glaze, if desired. Allow the glaze to harden slightly and then serve.  \nThe pies can be stored on the counter, loosely covered for 3 days. Don't place them in a plastic bag or container, or the glaze will soften.

Use the right pan - a heavy bottomed cast iron skillet or dutch oven is ideal. Don't use a thin pot because the oil can scorch. \n\n2. use the right oil. You want something with a high smoke point. My favorite is peanut oil. Don't fill your pan or pot too high (less than halfway, to be safe) so it won't bubble over.\n\n3. Maintain the right temperature. Ideally you want the oil to be at about 350\u00baF for this (for some quick-fried things, you might want it higher but this cooks for awhile). Having a thermometer is REALLY useful to know the exact temperature. I usually heat the oil a little hotter than I want it so it doesn't drop too low when I add the chicken to the oil. \n\n4. Don't add too much at once or the temperate will drop (too low a temperature will make it greasy). Better to do it in batches.

Place the onion and pepper slices in a bowl or tupperware container and pour the vinegar mixture over top. Let sit at room temperature for one to three hours.  \nWhile the quick pickles sit, make the pork. Take one of the white onion halves and coarsely chop it.

Remove the marinated pork from the container and let excess marinade drip off.

Add to the cast iron skillet and cook until the pineapple slightly caramelizes, about 3-4 minutes.  \nAdd the remaining pineapple juice and the pork back to the skillet and mix in with the pineapple and onion.

Place the onion and pepper slices in a bowl or tupperware container and pour the vinegar mixture over top. Let sit at room temperature for one to three hours.  \nWhile the quick pickles sit, make the pork. Take one of the white onion halves and coarsely chop it. Strain the canned pineapple chunks from the juice and save both in separate bowls.  \nPlace the ancho chile powder, three chipotle chiles, 2 tablespoons of adobo sauce, chopped white onion, about \u00be of the pineapple juice, the remaining apple cider vinegar, garlic, cumin, kosher salt, ground cloves, and oregano to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth.  \nPlace the chopped pork into a large plastic container with a lid. Pour the chile mixture over the pork and mix through to coat well. Marinate for at least an hour.  \nAfter marinating, preheat a cast iron skillet to high heat and add a tablespoon of oil. Remove the marinated pork from the container and let excess marinade drip off. In small batches, cook the pork until it is cooked through and slightly charred.  \nDice the remaining onion half and chop up the pineapple chunks. Add to the cast iron skillet and cook until the pineapple slightly caramelizes, about 3-4 minutes.  \nAdd the remaining pineapple juice and the pork back to the skillet and mix in with the pineapple and onion. Transfer the pork to a bowl and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm.  \nIn a large bowl, toss the cheddar cheese with the corn starch. Transfer to a medium-sized pot. Add the evaporated milk and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.  \nPreheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Arrange tortilla chips in a single layer in the cast iron skillet. Top with pork, cheese sauce, fresh pineapple, pepper jack cheese, and queso fresco. Repeat in multiple layers until all of the pork is used. Transfer to the oven and bake until the shredded cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.  \nTop with avocado, cilantro, green onion, sprouts, and the quick pickled onions and pepper slices. Drizzle with sour cream and serve with salsa.  ", "id": "d5ufidc"}, {"comment": "That ingredient list. It's...intimidating. But I have to say the results look amazingly delicious.

I believe this is because of the wrapping technique you mention in another response. At 203, the brisket is done and almost all of the moisture has been sweat away during the stall (which happens down around 140-160). You want to wrap right as the brisket is coming out of the stall, which is different for every brisket but is usually around 165 or so. The better way to know when you're coming out of the stall is to track temps of a leave in thermometer. The increase will slow down and may even stop for awhile. Then it will start to go up again more rapidly. Heres where you wrap. This preserves the last of the brisket's moisture within the pouch encompassing the meat, and will give it a chance to be reabsorbed later. \n\nOnce you've wrapped, toss the brisket back on the smoker for finishing. Now you're waiting for it to reach 200+, but really what you're waiting for is for the brisket to be nearly ready to fall apart. You take a pinch at the end of the flat and gently pull. If it feels like it would be happy to come apart in your hand if you just applied a little more pressure, it's done. \n\nPull it, and let it rest in the wrap for an hour, or maybe even more. You're really trying to get the temperature down to 160 or so, and get the juice reabsorbed back into the muscle fiber. \n\nHere's my [pic for proof](http://imgur.com/LhIxcKW) that I have some semblance of an idea of what I'm talking about.\n\nThis is from a cook about a month ago. 8 hours with post oak at 275, wrapped at 6 hours.

I believe this is because of the wrapping technique you mention in another response. At 203, the brisket is done and almost all of the moisture has been sweat away during the stall (which happens down around 140-160). You want to wrap right as the brisket is coming out of the stall, which is different for every brisket but is usually around 165 or so. The better way to know when you're coming out of the stall is to track temps of a leave in thermometer. The increase will slow down and may even stop for awhile. Then it will start to go up again more rapidly. Heres where you wrap. This preserves the last of the brisket's moisture within the pouch encompassing the meat, and will give it a chance to be reabsorbed later. \n\nOnce you've wrapped, toss the brisket back on the smoker for finishing. Now you're waiting for it to reach 200+, but really what you're waiting for is for the brisket to be nearly ready to fall apart. You take a pinch at the end of the flat and gently pull. If it feels like it would be happy to come apart in your hand if you just applied a little more pressure, it's done. \n\nPull it, and let it rest in the wrap for an hour, or maybe even more. You're really trying to get the temperature down to 160 or so, and get the juice reabsorbed back into the muscle fiber. \n\nHere's my [pic for proof](http://imgur.com/LhIxcKW) that I have some semblance of an idea of what I'm talking about.\n\nThis is from a cook about a month ago. 8 hours with post oak at 275, wrapped at 6 hours.

I've cooked them like you mention here, and it too can produce a great product, but it's not necessarily the only or \"best\" way to cook brisket. My method works really great for my cooker and I how I like to eat it. Also keep in mind that is a cross section of flat and point.

I made 72 hour short rib the other day, that only involved sticking some meat in a water bath and finishing under the grill, I served it with buttery mash, spinach and a nice sauce.  That's no more actual effort than somebody who made some pulled pork or sourdough or even a Sunday roast.  People have the perception that it's fancy food, when it's just different.  I don't have a proper barbecue, so all these slow smoked, pulled, Deep South dishes are flat out impossible for me in that manner.  In the UK pulled pork is actually seen as \"fancy\" as we don't make it.\n\nConversely, it's not elitist to call somebody out on something.  I don't only eat in Michelin starred restaurants, hell I mostly eat at home like everybody else.  My menu for the last week was pumpkin soup with bread on Monday, hot dogs (home done with decent sausages at least) on Tuesday, the aforementioned shortrib on Wednesday and a pasta bake made from be leftover sausages yesterday.

My mom adds a little bit of the liquid you get when you preserve young plums in buttloads of sugar. Kiwi is great for a speedy tenderizer BUT a little goes a long way & if you let it sit in the marinade for too long then the meat will be mush when it comes to chow time.

Kiwi is great for a speedy tenderizer BUT a little goes a long way & if you let it sit in the marinade for too long then the meat will be mush when it comes to chow time.

I make my pizza in a skillet from a recipe I learned on this [website](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2013/01/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe.html).  It's so fricken good.  \n\nMy favorite is a Canadian type of pizza in which there is mushrooms, bacon and pepperoni.  I precook the bacon a bit along with the mushrooms so they do not contribute any moisture to the actual pizza.  I cut the peperoni nice and thin and it actually goes on top so it gets nice and crispy.  So sauce then bacon and mushrooms, cheese and then followed by the pepperoni and homemade banana peppers.  Cook that as high as the oven will allow (mine is 500) for about 20 mins.  The best part of the skillet is you can get all the cheese right to the edge which makes for the best crust.  Also, if the top is looking done but the bottom needs a little more time, just take it out and slap it on the oven burner.  Just remember, don't fricken forget that pizza was in the oven and the handle is hot is hell.  Also don't forget to put on fresh parmesan at the end either.

Cut the tail in half. Crack the pieces open a bit to allow for easy access to the meat. Wash out any gunk.\n\n* Cut the remaining, inedible parts of the lobster (the torso) into four or five chunks and simmer in a pot with a pint of regular whipping cream, a small pat of butter, two tablespoons of brandy, a sprig of tarragon, a crushed clove of garlic, and two cups of water. Once reduced to about a cup of thick, bisque-like liquid (~30-40 minutes), filter out the pieces, throwing them away, and preserve the liquid.\n\n* Toss the bisque, pasta, bacon, and good lobster pieces (tail, claws, knuckles) in a shallow pan over medium heat to warm it all up.

Should I have kept it?", "id": "d4ese8q"}, {"comment": "No, the eggs (roes) or female lobsters (hens) are found on the little paddles (swimmerets) under the tail, where the egg-bound (gravid) hen can flap them to maintain a healthy water flow. \n\nInside the abdomen, you will find a number of organs. Of these, all are edible except for the digestive tract because it contains, well, lobster poop. \n\nWhite goop: the result of lobster blood being exposed to heat and congealing. Rich, oily, mildly flavored. Spread on bread or incorporate into pastas and soups. \n\nRed paste: the least flavorful part of the interior. Salty and tangy but not particularly meaty, it has a grainy texture that some people find unpleasant. Mash this very finely and incorporate it into sauces to give them a rich, Britney flavor and a pleasant roasted color. This is probably the matter you noticed. \n\nGreen goop: referred to as the liver, though it is actually composed of a number of organs. Rich, briny, buttery, and strongly shellfishy. This is considered the best part of the lobster by most enthusiasts, and is too good to be adulterated in cooking. Spread it on lightly toasted French or Italian bread, or use it in place of butter on the tail and claw meat. \n\nThe digestive tract is a skinny brown tube running all the way through the body. In the abdomen, it is too far down in the interior to be mush trouble. However, it also runs through the tail, and should be removed to keep the unpleasant stomach contents off the meat. To do this, follow the following steps:\n\n1. Having removed the tail from the body, snap off the paddle and the very last section of armor.\n\n2. Working from the small end to the large end, push the meat out of the shell. It should slip out easily. \n\n3. Look at the tail meat. You will see that it is composed of three distinct muscles that peel apart easily: one on the right, one on the left, and a smaller one on top. Peel off the small top muscle. \n\n4.

So long as it's lean, the source of the beef doesn't matter. \n\nWhile it's true that you can select a cut of meat and have it ground, that's not mainstream and you're probably paying a premium to do so.\n\nIf you're going to a high end grocery store, they'll keep the ground beef in the display case with the other meats and it's very fresh. Every night I'd be cubing stew beef or chunks for kabobs from the steaks that have started to brown. Ground up lots of browning beef and trimmings. Beef that has started to brown is still perfectly fine, it's just an oxidation reaction but it's difficult to market to people so it's put into other products at a cheaper price. I can't speak for every butcher or meat department around, but when I was working in meat, we always used perfectly fresh meat in our ground beef, it's just not economical to grind up a signal roast and package it so we'd work in 20ish pound batches. \n\nI see where you're going with grinding a chuck roast, but the resulting product is still probably very lean because the roast has been trimmed way down before it's hits the display case.
