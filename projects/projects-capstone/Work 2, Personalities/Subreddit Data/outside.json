First of all you must be able to understand and appeal to the broadest range of other player characters because your perceived Charisma isn't only based on how that particular player character perceives you, but on how they assume other player characters perceive you as well. If they see you handling yourself with social ease when communicating with many different types of people, or if they see that there are many people who like you, this also inspires confidence in your character. So step one is to grind your [empathy]. The more that you understand why people feel the way that they do and are able to have compassion for it, the more they will love you in return. If you are the kind of player character who says in chat, \"Most people are stupid,\" or, \"I hate people,\" this is going to be one of the first things you're going to have to change about yourself. This is one of the key tenants of the popular and sometimes controversial Charisma training manual, *How to Win Friends and Influence People*.\n\nUnderstanding other people and their feelings is impossible without understand your own first, however. You must be able to *relate* to other people. This is incredibly hard work that can take an entire playthrough to get right, and may require the assistance of the [Therapist] class, and/or may require grouping up with unusually empathic play character friends who can help you figure these things out about yourself. The listening that they do for you will serve as a model for how you should listen to others when you are ready to apply your own Charisma.\n\nFinally, Charisma isn't just about understanding other player characters, it's also about how we act upon them. The key action macro of Charisma is Expression. The Expression skill influences your ability to put difficult things into words, to speak with honesty, and to communicate to others with vulnerability. From Bren\u00e9 Brown's book on vulnerability and it's influencing effect on others:\n\n> We love seeing raw truth and openness in other people, but we're afraid to let them see it in us. Here's the crux of the struggle:\n\n> I want to experience your vulnerability, but I don't want to be vulnerable. Vulnerability is courage in you and inadequacy in me.\n\nOther people will think of you as courageous for your ability to express yourself with rawness and honesty, even as they may find it difficult to express themselves.\n\nThe best path toward grinding Expression is to do it as often as you can: go to social events, throw your own parties, take up some kind of Art (like music, acting, painting, writing, etc), and take classes that demand or enhance your expression. As an Actor class I'm pretty biased, but I feel that acting classes have the most direct influence on your ability to be socially expressive. Most acting classes revolve around your ability to maintain single-minded focus on what it is you are doing; to understand why people do the things that they do; to practice the many different ways you might respond to something someone has said (even using the same words); to become mindful of the affect that your expression has on an audience; to practice listening deeply to other people and to make minute observations of how they're feeling and what they're doing and attempt to act on them (Meisner technique is a great one for this); and to practice doing it all in a way that moves people. Not all actors have a naturally high Charisma score for character creation - in fact, most good actors I know got into acting because they were *not* good at being social, and this was how they started to meet people and learn to be social when they were in college or high school. People who have felt the desperate lack of something have the greatest potential for it's mastery.", "id": "cys5oaw"}, {"comment": "I felt i had to reply to this.\n\nMy Empathy.exe doesn't usually work as expected (it's essentially negligible, which actually comes in handy sometimes) but i consider it a feature rather than a bug.\n\nSo, i force Charisma whenever i can.

This means that if someone is finding it difficult to endure their current game scenario, a couple of things may help.\n\nThe first is simply having other players make it known that they are online and are supportive in full multiplayer mode - available to help them deal with the current *content* of their game whenever called upon. This is the right approach during a fellow player crisis, when a level has hit a difficulty spike.\n\nThe second, perhaps best suited to a post-crisis moment, is to contemplate the underlying nature of games in general - in other words, [the *context*](https://www.reddit.com/r/outside/comments/2kygk4/why_did_the_devs_implement_dreams/clqq0do) of our gameplay rather than just the *content*. With a deeper understanding of what a game actually *is* and our relationship to it, we might be better equipped to deal with future challenging levels - and even customise our own missions eventually to some extent.\n\nMost important, though, is for you to realise that you cannot play another player's game for them. You can only offer assistance to the extent that your character and the larger game world permits, and no more.

They are stuck on their levels - the problems starts, when PvP is forced upon other players, as I for one - don't want engage in PvP.\n\nI hope, that in next patch there will be special PvP only areas. That or before release of next pach I would like to read patch notes, where those new PvP areas are going to be implemented.\n\nAnd for real - PvP is only option for players with low INT stats. To unlock more options in game, you need not only higher INT, but also WIS that can be enhanced with time that is spent in game. Engaging in PvP seriously damages chance to raise WIS, also it can damage other basic stats, like STR or CHR, or even develop some nanoprogramms running in player OS, like depression.\nINT can be raised by using skill: reading(average player achieves it at level 6) - that is important basic skill to progress up to level 16 or 18 and even later. Sometimes it does not work out, as INT is prerequisite.\n\nSome players(*cough* animals) have quite high INT, but seems, that they can't pass INT of average lvl4 player, because of dominant player type, so they are in supression mode and might be available in future patches as playable characters, that is if current dominant version is taken out in future patches...\n\nFrom my observation PvP players take advantage of numbers when engaging in PvP. There is always some effort to organize those things and make it more appealing to beginners, but f@#k it! In the end it can only lead to mass PvP. The problem with PvP, including mass PvP is that SUM of INT of involved players does not exceed MIN INT of player, who has the minimum INT. Players with high INT suffers most and should avoid PvP.\n\nPvP path is not wise to take, unless you have better STR, or better weapons and armors and have enough skills(depends on PvP) to survive. PvP requires advanced math to calculate chances of success and survival. Anyway - unprepared players who take PvP path, usually reach End of Game event and can't progress further with their level. Though, it really depends on playstyle - some players seek endgame, only because they don't see complexity of the game and available options and are bored or something. I don't know... I've heard that other game starts only when this is closed completelly - and it might run even when all the players have left it.

It is other way around - I actually have weak spot for weaklings.\n\nSadly, but I'm more experienced at PvP(not the lethal that was subject of my and other posts) than I'd like to be. PvP is silly and dumb, because there are not enough spoils from victories to outweight spent time and resources, to justify PvP. Not in this game. PvP gives only losses and if not immediately, then in longer run for sure.

I'm always consistently questioning meta gameplay and which side quests to take, even as to go and maybe change servers. I'm always overthinking and doubting myself of which is the best skill tree path to take. Eventually I'm always stuck with having to choose the most viable option at the time based on character rolls and traits (I took the university choice), but I'm not too sure on how it will pan out at higher levels, as i've seen in other player's guides with poor results which can result in permanent player nerfs. As with all players, the fact that you have to be consistently on point with meta game and side-quest decisions made can degrade player performances significantly, and devs don't see this at all. Trying to even complete the \"get to X on time\" main quests in the morning are fucking ridiculous, i'd rather play Osu! with my right hand on \"U.N owen was her\" with the hardest difficulty level and draw a monochromatic Mona Lisa, pixel perfect with the spray can, in blood, on ms paint with my left hand (although, I wouldn't mind seeing a TAS bot do this to be quite honest.)\n\nThe only thing I truly enjoy nowadays are the minigames. I don't get any XP or currency though for playing (too high level), but that's the only way I enjoy this game anymore.

In Fallout 3, there's Good and there's Evil, and that's that. \n\nIf you want a perfect comparison, I recommend playing A Tale of Two Wastelands, which is a mod that joins together Fallout 3 and New Vegas. \n\nYou can travel between the two wastelands with the same character, and while the exploration is excellent in Fallout 3 just as in New Vegas, the questing has such a gigantic rift in quality that you're bound to notice it no matter what sort of player you are.

It's technically better in every single way, but in the process it loses its original charm. \n\nLike in fallout the reason bottlecaps were used as currency was because they were used as an ad hoc currency in the vaults and most of humanity had recently emerged from the vaults.   \n\nBy fallout 2 which was further in the future, they had been done away with.   Then fallout 3 brought them back because.... ?   Like someone thought they were \"fun\" and \"kitschy\" I guess? \n\nAnd the reason the vaults ran off the rails was people just went nuts underground due to poor planning, which was the theme of the game.   Bethesda decided that they were just mk ultra on a grand scale.   \n\nThose things seem minor in their own, but it speaks to a reboot that generally just didn't care about canon.

Non-story potential FO4 spoilers ahead.\n\nYou pick up a flyer, it tells you about a racetrack. You find the racetrack and hear an announcer commentating on the race, you think \"Man, maybe there are some interesting characters in there, maybe a betting mechanic, maybe a quest to help fix up a crappy bot to make it the champion.\"\n\nNope. You walk in, they all aggro without explanation other than \"they're enemies\". You kill everyone. You kill the bots. You leave.\n\nSame thing happens at the combat arena. I walk in and there's a bunch of \"no fighting\" signs and some people being punished for it off to the left. I realize it's like an MMA tournament place and I get kind of excited even though I'm not a melee build. Nope, you walk in and everyone aggros, breaking the 'no fighting' rule immediately because for some reason they all recognize you and want you dead? You kill them all, talk to the owner and take his best fighter as a companion and send her off to Sanctuary. The worst part is that you can walk around the building and you see places that might've been for guys selling stuff, high-rise viewpoints for important audience members, enemies with actual names who you'll never learn the backstory of because they don't have one. They went from being potentially enriching interactions to just another head down the sights, same as every other.\n\nYou get to a quarry, there's a guy trying to drain it to do some shit. You help him drain it, there's some crabs that appear and you kill them. He thanks you and you leave. You come back later, after all the draining is done? There's raiders, and he's working with them, and they're all aggro, and there's no dialogue options or actual interactivity to be had. No \"Hey guys he's with me\", nothing. Just another head down the sights.\n\nThere's a town run entirely by Sentry bots, a kind of Town of Tomorrow, where all the necessities are managed by robots. You can go around and interact with them, but each time you do so it ends up with them going aggro for stupid reasons, even though you've been identified as the supervisor by the main guard - who, once this happens, you will have no further interaction with. So after you explore the town you can do the quest and identify yourself as the supervisor to the main robot guy in the center of the town (up a big elevator) and *then* he'll turn off the aggro. By then pretty much all the other robots are dead already, because that's what players do, they explore an area before doing anything else in it, which in this case just causes everything to want to kill you. So you're left with another dead area with the potential to be something more that never got realized. Even if you had gone straight to the center and done the quest first, the only thing you gain from the robots is that some of them will trade non-unique crap you don't need. That's it. It doesn't become a settlement, there's no 'important' Sentry bots to interact with on any meaningful level, nothing. Just another essentially empty place.\n\nThere's a kind of interesting faction called the Mercs, and they're really well-equipped and seem like a low-tech free-market Enclave, having a military motif. There is, as far as I know, no way to interact with any of these people - many of whom have names - beyond just killing them when you find them. They might as well not even be people. There's no persuading them to trade, hiring them for yourself, joining up, any kind of meaningful interaction at all. Sometimes, as in the case of that one town all the Sanctuary people are from, you go in and murder everybody (of course, they're mercs, it's all you can do) and afterward you can read a bunch of diary entries and letters they wrote to each other, and that's supposed to make them feel more like characters with backstory. But it doesn't, because once again, in the end they were all just heads down the sights. You learn about an ex-Minuteman who joined up with the Mercs and is the reason they were able to take the town. According to his diary entries, he believes the Mercs are the only solution, having the most presence and strength to enforce a kind of post-apocalyptic peace like no other faction can do. Which is why he left the Minutemen, because they had fallen, and became weak and unable to enforce peace. None of this matters, though; for as interesting as this character is, and for as much backstory as he has that involves the other major NPCs you've come to know, you can never interact with him, and you can never watch him interact with other NPCs. He's just another head down the sights.\n\nNothing about any of these things matter. They lead you into believing maybe the world is more complicated and interesting than it is, maybe there are some grey-area characters to get to know and agree or disagree with. No. You just consistently meet more people who give you no choice but to murder them the instant you see them. Heads down the sight.", "id": "cykdn0p"}, {"comment": "Yes, sorry!

There have been reports of Admin intervention in the *Monotheism* DLC because it added the Christianity, Judaism, and Islam *Religion Packs*, but most reports state it was a single Admin trying to act like a developer post-release. I mean, just because you don't like how the players play the game doesn't give you the right to flood the servers. But hey, some Admins are cranky, we've all heard about it. In any case, there was a Dev note released to all players at the time that servers would never get wiped like that again.\n\n* There have been reports of Admin intervention via *Miracle Buffs* but those were primarily attributed to the *Medieval Times* DLC. Since that DLC, *Miracle Buffs* have only been seen on just a few players or events, and since many of the *Miracle Buffs* found within the *Modern Age* and *Diamond Age* DLC (current) can be attributed to built-in gameplay mechanics, it's been very difficult to trace any recent Admin intervention.\n\nNo, it's far more likely that these rings are infiltrated by people claiming to work on behalf of the Admins as *player-admin liaisons* or *player-dev liaisons.* In the past they've frequently RP'd as Clerics within one of the various *Religion* expansions packs. And as we all know there are literally dozens and dozens of playable *Religion* packs. I mean it's almost a joke at this point how lazy the devs are getting with some of these packs. Some are so terrible and badly programmed that there are only a dozen or so players who actually use them, and once those players start the only way to stop seems to be to \"drink the kool-aid.\"\n\n* Although the *Monotheism* DLC provides quite a few of the most popular Religion packs, the Buddhism, Hinduism, and Mormonism Religion pack are of particular note because they all allow for the possibility that a player could eventually become an Admin or one of several Admins. \n\n* But even if we suppose those players are interventionist Admins, it's worth noting that they're impact on *this* server is practically non-existant. For example, Mormons become Admins of separate server shards, so we wouldn't see their involvement on this *Outside* server. \n\n* The current Buddhism Admin is high level and while he plays the role of a significant political figure, his Admin duties are currently limited to non-meta activities, which makes him a useless Admin. His only extended player ability as Admin is the ability to restart his game in an entirely new body. I don't know about you, but I spent ages on *character creation* and frankly, I only became a somewhat decent player once I achieved the *Adulthood* and *Thirties* stat boost. So this Admin ability hardly gives you as much influence over game events as you'd think.\n\nGetting back to the subject, there are many criminal activities that players can engage in, and typically these players will RP Multi-class characters to blend in.

Some players trying to go in the music questline try to use theory to help them make music, and decide what to do, whereas those high high creativity stats, and talent stats, feel and hear the music in their mind and body, and use that to create. Obviously they will always use concepts and ideas that have been named. Pitches interact in ways that deserve to be named. If you're going to make music it is impossible to escape the nature of pitch interaction. But creativty and making great music is a lot more than that. It is easy to use the same concepts and in one case, use them to make something great, and in another to make something less great. The secrets of great composition are not documented in the theory knowledge pack add-on. That's why computers and npcs are not capable of creating hit content, and why some specific player characters are highly coveted for their custom content. It's because they aren't just following a logic they picked up on some side quest. It's more magical than that. \n\nI promise you that there is talent hard coded into the game.

Its other players that dictate their own wants. It actually involves you. Some people believe there are no other players and that everyone aside from them is an NPC... yeah right. You can figure out NPCs. Especially animal NPCs. Although most humans vary in level of predictablity, they are far more unpredictable overall. And so it becomes a shot in the dark. Typically other players do well wiyh similar but slightly different. Example. The red hot chilli peppers arguably eased a lot of people into the punk genre. It could be said that a similar band couldn't exiat today nor acsend to stardom because those near the end of the entertainment quest line who chose the music industry path dont take chances. Players want the same but different. Producers want VERY MUCH the same but slightly different. So music chugs along at a slower pace than we want it to. Unfortunately the music exists and is being missed out on by an industru that is doomed to move just a bit too slow to catch onto trends. Business ruins everything.

This is mostly going to focus on the European server, unfortunately. Originally, in Ancient patches, combat was mostly done with spears, swords, slings, and bows. Short and long ranged versions of ranged and melee weapons, essentially. Thing is, it was a LOT harder to train to basic proficiency with ranged weapons than melee, so most guilds had their armies made up mostly of sword or spearmen for a very long time.\n\nNow, fast forward a bit to the Medieval patches. New versions of weapons had been patched in for a while, but most combat was still done with swords, spears (now diversified into all sorts of polearms), and bows (slings had fallen out of favor, mostly). Shields and armor were better than before, too. Sometimes. A new ranged weapon was finally added, one that didn't take the years of training a bow did: crossbows. However, those had their own problems (mainly the tremendous time between shots lowering DPS and a lack of range and single-shot power compared to longbows).\n\nFast forward a bit more, to the later Medieval patches. Gunpowder got introduced to the European server as part of the slow server-merging program (which is mostly complete today), though it originated from the China server. Guns were invented, but weren't seriously considered part of the meta yet because bows were better and plate armor could stop most bullets.\n\nGuns got buffed, enough to make armor not quite worth it against them, and the resource drops needed to make bows got nerfed, making them far more expensive to make. Now, for a lot of people, it was starting to look like guns could replace bows and crossbows. They were just as easy to train people on as crossbows (no 20-year skill tree like for bows, especially the longbowmen of the English guild) and they were starting to become effective battlefield weapons in their own right.\n\nNow, during this time, melee was still plenty present in the meta. Though swords had largely fallen out of favor past the Medieval patches for large-scale guild combats, they were still used in smaller scale PvP and were useful tools in PvE. However, large scale combat was done mostly with pikes and guns, a meta called (unsurprisingly) \"pike and shot\". Cavalry were used too, but they were as expensive as ever, so the core of guild armies were pike and shot formations.\n\nFast forward a bit more. The \"Bayonet Patch\" happens. *This* is where the meta gets COMPLETELY FUCKED. Bayonets let people put knives on the end of their guns and use them as melee weapons. Now with a little bit of training down both skill trees, anyone could fill either role in the formations. Guns quickly became the primary mode of combat, and rather than delivering a nerf to guns (or removing bayonets entirely), guns were patched up to be better and better, with things like rifling (a major accuracy and power buff), RoF buffs (think breech-loaders, lever-actions, bolt-actions, revolvers, semi-autos, and automatics), and consistent buffs to power, accuracy, and reliability.\n\nOf course, this kind of ignores things like artillery (it started pretty lame but eventually got buffed so hard that it now kills more people than anything else during guild wars, and that was before the targeting buffs and aircraft recon after v.1914 and v.1915), and pretty much only talks about the Europe server, but it's a decent explanation of how melee builds fell from grace and why combat grew to be dominated by guns."], [1, "if the zombies dlc ever gets released then i think swords and bow and arrows will become effective again, since they have near infinite ammo"], [1, "Maybe because ranged weapons like guns are typically considered more useful now, considering how the combat system has changed to being more reliant on either distance or stealth (hence knife melee weapons being more effective than a longsword in updated gameplay, and given that a player with a gun would take out a player with a sword near instantly unless they had a high stealth or sprint skill, or high rated armour resistant to bullets, which is difficult to do with a lot of items (such as a massive sword) in your inventory).\n"], [1, "In terms of damage dealing, they are equal with the current meta weapons; guns. The issue is with equal lethality, it is much harder to beat the kiting and range of the gun. "], [0, "Diplomacy builds kept bitching about them, because there was literally no effective countermeasure. They eventually banded together and griefed the shit out of anyone using swords by summoning police NPCs, after the big 'law & order' patch. Sword builds lost a lot of their faction rep as a result, and have pretty much been nerfed into nonexistence as a result. \n\nThe devs thought this was hilarious so they've kept the joke going ever since. Frankly it's diplomacy that needs the nerf, not guns. "]], [[{"comment": "Apparently it's part of the ongoing \"Technology\" patches.

This is mostly going to focus on the European server, unfortunately. Originally, in Ancient patches, combat was mostly done with spears, swords, slings, and bows. Short and long ranged versions of ranged and melee weapons, essentially. Thing is, it was a LOT harder to train to basic proficiency with ranged weapons than melee, so most guilds had their armies made up mostly of sword or spearmen for a very long time.\n\nNow, fast forward a bit to the Medieval patches. New versions of weapons had been patched in for a while, but most combat was still done with swords, spears (now diversified into all sorts of polearms), and bows (slings had fallen out of favor, mostly). Shields and armor were better than before, too. Sometimes. A new ranged weapon was finally added, one that didn't take the years of training a bow did: crossbows. However, those had their own problems (mainly the tremendous time between shots lowering DPS and a lack of range and single-shot power compared to longbows).\n\nFast forward a bit more, to the later Medieval patches. Gunpowder got introduced to the European server as part of the slow server-merging program (which is mostly complete today), though it originated from the China server. Guns were invented, but weren't seriously considered part of the meta yet because bows were better and plate armor could stop most bullets.\n\nGuns got buffed, enough to make armor not quite worth it against them, and the resource drops needed to make bows got nerfed, making them far more expensive to make. Now, for a lot of people, it was starting to look like guns could replace bows and crossbows. They were just as easy to train people on as crossbows (no 20-year skill tree like for bows, especially the longbowmen of the English guild) and they were starting to become effective battlefield weapons in their own right.\n\nNow, during this time, melee was still plenty present in the meta. Though swords had largely fallen out of favor past the Medieval patches for large-scale guild combats, they were still used in smaller scale PvP and were useful tools in PvE. However, large scale combat was done mostly with pikes and guns, a meta called (unsurprisingly) \"pike and shot\". Cavalry were used too, but they were as expensive as ever, so the core of guild armies were pike and shot formations.\n\nFast forward a bit more. The \"Bayonet Patch\" happens. *This* is where the meta gets COMPLETELY FUCKED. Bayonets let people put knives on the end of their guns and use them as melee weapons. Now with a little bit of training down both skill trees, anyone could fill either role in the formations. Guns quickly became the primary mode of combat, and rather than delivering a nerf to guns (or removing bayonets entirely), guns were patched up to be better and better, with things like rifling (a major accuracy and power buff), RoF buffs (think breech-loaders, lever-actions, bolt-actions, revolvers, semi-autos, and automatics), and consistent buffs to power, accuracy, and reliability.\n\nOf course, this kind of ignores things like artillery (it started pretty lame but eventually got buffed so hard that it now kills more people than anything else during guild wars, and that was before the targeting buffs and aircraft recon after v.1914 and v.1915), and pretty much only talks about the Europe server, but it's a decent explanation of how melee builds fell from grace and why combat grew to be dominated by guns.", "id": "d45kzgt"}], [{"comment": "if the zombies dlc ever gets released then i think swords and bow and arrows will become effective again, since they have near infinite ammo", "id": "d48e8nv"}], [{"comment": "Maybe because ranged weapons like guns are typically considered more useful now, considering how the combat system has changed to being more reliant on either distance or stealth (hence knife melee weapons being more effective than a longsword in updated gameplay, and given that a player with a gun would take out a player with a sword near instantly unless they had a high stealth or sprint skill, or high rated armour resistant to bullets, which is difficult to do with a lot of items (such as a massive sword) in your inventory).\n", "id": "d49yph7"}], [{"comment": "In terms of damage dealing, they are equal with the current meta weapons; guns.

One without using any gold and the other uses significantly less.\n\nOption 1: Very risky but still works. Just print an in game diploma from the college of your choice. You won't get the college quest but it opens most of the post college DLC. Take care as other players are really cracking down on this glitch and will out you if they can, especially if they paid full price for the college occupation buff. If you get caught you will get a huge occupation debuff.\n\nOption 2: This one takes a bit longer (less than one quarter the college quest) and will require some gold but just a tiny fraction of what the college DLC costs without this glitch. Also keep in mind this glitch requires grinding. Basically instead of paying full price for the college DLC you participate in tests of skill. Just search in game for CLEP, DSST, ECE, ACE, CCRS, etc.. . Each try will cost you some gold so you should make sure your are ready to pass them prior to starting or you can end up wasting a lot of your gold. Essentially this is just a quicker and cheaper way to gain experience like the alchemy glitch in Skyrim. You can get all the post college DLC content for one tenth the gold but keep in mind that any skill test you pass will expire if not converted inside six months (varies). This is why most players don't try this glitch. Here is the key to making this work - there is a faction that will help you preserve them until you have enough skill points to create the in game item \"College degree\". Search in game for Excelsior credit banking, it will cost you some gold but it is well worth it. The occupational buff from this approach is exactly the same as the buff you get if you pay full price for and successfully complete all the college DLC quests. You will also get a secret in game achievement (au\u00b7to\u00b7di\u00b7dact). I don't know of anyway you can get debuffed from this glitch but there are some classes where you would be better off just purchasing the college DLC. Medic and Paladin* classes usually require a Post Graduate quest where this glitch will cause you far more trouble than its worth. With most other classes you are OK to start the post graduate quests if you used this glitch. One final note if you do get the autodidact achievement you should be very forthcoming about it as it can give you the equivalent occupational buff as some of the most exclusive and expensive College DLC.\n\n*Since the debuff to PVP Paladins that did not convert to Cleric or fanatic ended up taking the lawyer class.

The *Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines* mini-game has the Humanity attribute, which works in a similar way.  The founder of the Scientology guild, L. Ron. Hubbard, flatlined Sanity as a result of deficient Integrity.\n\nWhen Integrity gets too low, you go mad because you will have told so many lies that you won't know which ones to believe yourself.  As with the VTM mini-game, frenzying can occur, as well.  You'll probably end up ganking other players to the point where someone from one of the PKK guilds will get hold of you.\n\nI think the Integrity attribute is related to the health of a player's heart, as well.  If you look at a number of gold farmer players, you'll notice that heart problems are reasonably consistent among them.\n\nIntegrity is also valuable in my experience, because by keeping my own Integrity score reasonably high, I can attract players who I can trust.  The in-game group finder tends to match players to each other who have similar stats, and your Integrity score influences that as much as anything else.  People with higher Integrity are more likely to treat you well, be generous, won't steal or lie to you etc.\n\nIntegrity also directly boosts the Charisma attribute, as well.  You can either use high CHA to mask low Integrity, or you can farm Integrity and end up with a combined score of both which is twice as high.\n\nSo for me it's worth having.

First, it requires technique and practise to become dependably accurate (much like learning archery in earlier versions). \n\nSecond, guns need a round inserted in the chamber between each shot.

What I mean by this, is that a lot of players might spend their time grinding skill points in the instrument of their choice, all the while becoming increasingly technically skilled, but never actually becoming a successful bard.\n\nFor bards success can be summed up by the amount of fame points that one is able to aquire. And this is where we come upon the mistake one often makes in trying to obtain the bard class. A successful bard is heavily invested in charisma. For all that dexterity and skill grinding might improve ones technical skills, a bard must be network well, be attractive and sellable, and have the type of magnetic personality that draws people towards them.\n\nTo sum it up, playing the bard has pros and cons. A successful bard requires a high charisma build, and climaxes in intense fame with a high probability of early death. A dexterity based bard would be the ideal build for those who are just interested in the craft itself.

It's a hard class to be good at, and requires a very specific player skillset, one that often can't be learned through experience.  I mean, Adam Levine isn't even a very good bard!

A correlation can be drawn between the amount of success one receives and the expected lifespan one has.\n\nAlso, it should be said that while quality and success may have some relation, it can be said that they aren't neccesarily equivalent. What I mean by this, is that a lot of players might spend their time grinding skill points in the instrument of their choice, all the while becoming increasingly technically skilled, but never actually becoming a successful bard.\n\nFor bards success can be summed up by the amount of fame points that one is able to aquire. And this is where we come upon the mistake one often makes in trying to obtain the bard class. A successful bard is heavily invested in charisma. For all that dexterity and skill grinding might improve ones technical skills, a bard must be network well, be attractive and sellable, and have the type of magnetic personality that draws people towards them.\n\nTo sum it up, playing the bard has pros and cons. A successful bard requires a high charisma build, and climaxes in intense fame with a high probability of early death. A dexterity based bard would be the ideal build for those who are just interested in the craft itself.

To nest a simulated game one must continually reset to the first level and alter/refine each translated version. We found the code that we work from it is the code the whole system is designed to teach/learn each level provides a single piece to the puzzle and the game play in each level explains how we found the piece and why it is important. The key center point of the (A)alpha transition into (B)beta is determined when the narrative of the next level is figured out/ or have enough pieces to test the new (C)nested level of game simulation.

But occasionally one pushes through the cracks and forces the system to roll out new logic. This is the Cue we look for when designing every new nested level if one crack does not form then the narrative is analyzed and rerun until the pattern of synergy is discovered.\n\n----------\n\nYou will never know if a Dev made your decision for you which is what every level has to accept.

Now you can understand O(mega = END) determines the Center point when things are required to fit all the way back to the beginning(ALPHA); Using the term \u201cSurvival of the FITTEST\u201d when items are TESTed and they do not FIT which will require additional code/script to the overall narrative it is scheduled for UPgrades/transition/Translation.\n\n----------\n\nI know all I have been posting is a large pill to swallow but the choice is yours.

One of the criticisms often brought up is that the wager doesn't tell you which of the theories about the dev(s) to believe and doesn't tell you what they want. As such it's a fairly fruitless effort, for it's just as possible that if the dev demands worship and the player accidentally does it the wrong way or worships the wrong idol it might just piss the dev off worse than not doing anything at all, it's even a pretty common string in the stories about the dev that the dev told people to not believe that other devs exist.

Their refute seems to rely on infinite possible devs and all of them having an equal chance of actually existing, as it stands I'm not convinced of either of those premises.\n\nEven if I'm wrong I've lost nothing (breaking another premise of the refute) if there is no dev then logically there is also no absolute scoring system that I should be trying to max out.

And the same goes for most theories, all of them think they've got the solid evidence and the others are frauds but really none of them do. \n\nThat's wrong actually. The philosophy guild has been decided for a long time now that there is actually a scoring system. Some take the position against it but the vast majority believe the scoring system exists without the dev even if the dev exists as it wouldn't make sense as a scoring system to rely on the dev.

This alone may be fairly harmless, but a long time ago in order to instigate more dynamic player-faction interactions the devs implemented a somewhat sinister mechanic.

However, there are some characteristics and traits that can be modified after the fact. \n\nAttractiveness is actually based upon a number of other base and secondary traits. \n\n For example, it is important to visit the character appearance modification vendors periodically to ensure your character's hair is appropriately managed.  Likewise, visit armor vendors to ensure your character's styling is from the current version of the game and properly matched to your character's size and weight stats. These are small pieces of the appearance trait and max out quickly, so you don't need to spend a ton of gold here unless you want to.\n\nIncreasing STR and DEX, will have a natural buff on appearance / attractiveness.  These are harder to improve and typically require a certain amount of grinding, but arguably have the greatest effect.  You can also improve these stats through some of the mini games.  You will probably notice significant improvements to STA and overall Health as well.\n\nCHR is a bit tougher to improve, but it can be done. Have your character learn new skills outside of your primary skill tree. Don't treat other players like NPCs, and instead try joining the chat channels at taverns and when your character is away from your base. Engaging in mini games can give you  the opportunity to find new parties, local groups and guilds that you may want to join. \n\nAlcohol can give a minimal buff to CHR if used at the right time, but comes with a significant set of debuffs to INT and DEX. If you use too much alcohol, you will actually debuff CHR and eventually your total Health, so use those pots sparingly. Health debuffs from alcohol can become permanent over time.\n\nOverall, just investigate opportunities to find other players you enjoy playing with.

Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. \u201cDon\u2019t be alarmed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s alive!\u201d Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left. The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dActs\u202c \u202d20:7-12\u202c \u202dNIV\u202c\u202c\nhttp://bible.com/111/act.20.7-12.niv\n\n\u201cAt that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. They came out of the tombs after Jesus\u2019 resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dMatthew\u202c \u202d27:51-53\u202c \u202dNIV\u202c\u202c\nhttp://bible.com/111/mat.27.51-53.niv\n\n\u201cJesus said to her, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?\u201d \u201cYes, Lord,\u201d she replied, \u201cI believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.\u201d\n\nWhen Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled. \u201cWhere have you laid him?\u201d he asked. \u201cCome and see, Lord,\u201d they replied. Jesus wept. Then the Jews said, \u201cSee how he loved him!\u201d But some of them said, \u201cCould not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?\u201d Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance. \u201cTake away the stone,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, Lord,\u201d said Martha, the sister of the dead man, \u201cby this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.\u201d Then Jesus said, \u201cDid I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?\u201d So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, \u201cFather, I thank you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me.\u201d When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, \u201cLazarus, come out!\u201d The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, \u201cTake off the grave clothes and let him go.\u201d\u201d\n\u202d\u202dJohn\u202c \u202d11:25-27, 33-44\u202c \u202dNIV\u202c\u202c\nhttp://bible.com/111/jhn.11.25-27,33-44.niv", "id": "d1ne47l"}], [{"comment": "This is a death trap if you have children, that being said awesome job looks pretty ballin \n\nEdit: I suck and commented on the wrong post.
