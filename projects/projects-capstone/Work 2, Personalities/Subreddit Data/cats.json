I loved cats, but never thought I could live with one.  That was until I moved to Arizona.  A few days later, I went outside and this wretched little calico kitten came out from under a car.\n\nShe was in bad shape.  Her coat was stiff and patchy - she had lost fur from malnutrition.  Ribs and spine sticking sharply out, just skin and bones.  She had a number of sores and some bad skin.  She had to have a few bad teeth removed.  And she only has about half of a tail.\n\nSo she looked me right in the eye and walked right up to me.  I put my hand down and she started purring right before she walked into my hand.  I only petted her for about a minute and then just picked her up.  She liked that.  I took her inside and sat down on the sofa and held her for about two hours while realizing I now had a cat.  I went off for cat food, a litterbox, thrift store fleece blankets, etc.  Oh yeah, she moved right in.\n\nShe provoked my allergies like crazy for about six weeks.  I took meds and then one day I noticed that she didn't bother me any more.  I Googled a bit and learned that this happens to many allergy sufferers.\n\nThe calico now lives with mom and dad.  They fell really hard for her and laid down a guilt trip.  Which is OK, since they love her and, as it turns out, their entire neighborhood loves her.  She visits around 20 houses and is ridiculously spoiled.  Get this - there's a veterinarian two houses away.  The calico loves her, so she gets handled by a vet daily.  Not such a bad ending for a wretched little alley cat.\n\nI'm not lonely.  A few weeks later, someone dumped a big gray tabby girl in the alley behind my place.  She let me pet her right away and then moved right in.  Then someone dumped a black kitten in a parking lot.  He followed me to my car and got right in.  He purred on my lap all the way home, then walked in like he owned the place.  I guess he does now.  A couple years later, a tiny black kitten, about four weeks old, turned up in the alley.  He latched on, too.  Three months later *another* black kitten showed up.\n\nSo I have the \"Three Amigos,\" black toms, and the gray tabby girl.

Years ago, I'm at home, watching movies, late at night, and I decide to get a snack.  I get up in the dark, go to the fridge, and little baby Squeaker cat follows.  She too was very much about trying to jump into the fridge everytime I opened the door.  I grab my snack, turn to set something on the counter, and I close the refrigerator door.\n\nI go back to living room and finish watching my movie.  About an hour later, I realize I haven't seen Squeaker in a bit and I'm a little befuddled.  She was a baby at the time, the size of my hand.  Lots of places to hide.  It's about 2 am.  I start looking for her in the apartment, calling for her.  No answer.  Check the bedroom.  Nothing.  Check the bathroom.  Nothing.  Then, I remember seeing her in the kitchen and went OH NO!  \n\nSure enough, I open the fridge and there she is, fluffy mcflufferson to the max from the cold.  MEOW she says.  Cutest damn thing I ever saw.  She didn't even care she'd been stuck in there for almost two hours.  She was three times her normal size, her fur fluffed out from the cold.   For days afterwards, I was finding little kitten nibble marks on all my cheese and ham and butter and lasagna.

He was a vet in the English Yorkshire Highlands(dales) after WWII. He had a territory of many farming families over a large area. His tales cover many animals. There are so many that they have been culled to make a cat stories book, a dog stories book, and two individual books about specific animals with unusual stories (\"Blossom Comes Home\" - about a cow who won't be parted from her dairy farm owner; \"Just One Bark\" is about a dog.)\n\n\n\n**Wee Emily's Perilous Pregnancy**\n\nThere was a rover who lived in the hills. Percival had family who would have taken him in (and would have preferred he did accept), but he couldn't sleep under a roof for long. He had to be out in the hills. Percival wasn't a Romany, but had the same yearning to sleep under the stars and breathe freely.\n\nIn the Dales in the 1930s & 40s, farm folk rarely had phones. Those that did found them unreliable during heavy weather, and often did not use them at all. Thus they were isolated. Percival carried news and announcements from homestead to homestead.  So he was well-received, well-fed, and well-loved.\n\nPercival had a cat named Emily who was the darling of his life. All his worldly belongs were packed in a pram which he pushed before him, up and down the dales. Emily would ride perched on top of the pile, sitting pretty, surveying her domain. \n\nIf she spied an interesting movement in the grass, or perhaps a heard the squeak of a furry snack, she was off and running. She always returned after a while, sometimes a bit bedraggled and wet, or with a limp body of a vole carried beneath a smug smile. \n\nEmily, too, was beloved by those they visited, and in turn, loved the subjects in her demesne. Particularly, as it turned out - a particular tom.\n\nShe became pregnant, and Percival was immediately in a dither. She was a small cat, and he couldn't imagine her enduring childbirth.\n\nAs Emily became more heavy, Percival began to make his route in halves, centering them around the vet's home, just in case. She grew larger and larger, and it seemed her belly overshadowed the rest of her. \n\nHe became more distressed, as he brooded over what pain she would experience during the birth. He began to fash himself over the possibility she wouldn't make it. Or worse, she'd suffer for hours, and then die - spending her final hours of life in a haze of torment.\n\nFolk noticed that for the first time in Percival's life, he displayed a furrowed brow and a mien of anxiousness. The village began to fret over him as much as he did over Emily. Dusty telephones were wiped down as the traveler became the subject of local concern.\n\nNow it must be mentioned that the entire time Percival brooded over Emily's heavy load, she herself enjoyed the animal gift of living in the moment. She never passed a moment of uneasiness about herself, but did show increasing signs of concern about Percival. He later relayed how she had slept closer to him, wandered less in the night, and no longer ventured as far away from the pram. \n\nA hundred years ago, c-sections were still new; rarely did both mother & newborn survive. IIRC, Herriot never mentioned this option, as he was afeared Percival could not survive seeing Emily cut open.\n\nWhen Emily was at the point where she could no longer jump from & up into the pram, Percival stayed in the village. \n\nOne evening Percival arrived at Herriot's home in a state of agony. Emily had finally begun to go into labor. Though apologetic for interrupting Herriot's dinner (lunch to us), he was in a state and Herriot gladly followed Percival to the edge of the village.\n\nAs Herriot entered Percival's tent, he noticed how Emily's area had been arranged with care for her comfort - food, fresh water, and a pan of earth. Percival had ensured she would not stir unless necessary.\n\nHerriot and Emily passed the first two hours in relative peace, interrupted by regular (though shortening) intervals of her laboring. Percival had been cognizant enough to provide dinner for the vet - meat & potatoes wrapped in foil and buried in the ashes of the fire outside the tent. \n\nDuring each occasion that Emily began panting and her (admittedly much thinner) sides showed the evidence of squirming life inside, Percival descended from torment to anguish. But to Herriot's admiration, Percival followed the vet's suggestion to refrain from cossetting Emily and distracting her from work. \n\nFinally, around suppertime, Emily showed dedication and purpose to getting this annoying business over with. Herriot ensured that she had a modicum of assistance with gently dilating and lubricating the birth passage.\n\nDuring the worst minutes of Percival's life so far, Emily finished the rest of her labors. \n\nAnd produced a kitten of gargantuan proportions. Percival at last began to relax, and prepared to wait out the arrival of its siblings. \n\nHe and Herriot sipped a bit of warmth to soothe their nerves. Eventually Emily expelled the afterbirth, greatly confusing Percival. Where was the rest of the litter?\n\nHerriot explained that for many cats, the first pregnancy often resulted in a single kitten. He cleaned her up and ensured that mother and kitten were in good health, then left the tent for a bit to  stretch his limbs and stroll about.\n\nLater, he sat with Percival as they both savored quality cigars that had been produced to celebrate Emily's motherhood.\n\nOver a few hours, Herriot took time to luxuriate in the rare opportunity to fully unwind without rushing to another case. \n\nFor of course, the whole village had been informed by Herriot's neighbor when Percival arrived. \n\nPhones had rung up and down the Dales as Herriot dashed from his house after the distraught man. \n\nThere wasn't a human heart beating that was unaccompanied by prayers for a cat (a species oft forgotten by those who depended on the horse, cow, sheep, and pig for their living). For all knew that Percival would be a wreck of a man, a body preparing for ghosthood, should Emily not make it.\n\nImpromptu picnics were arranged as others packed up their own dinners and wandered over to the far edges of the commons. Lingering. Hoping. For some reason, everyone spoke in whispers, as one does during moments of awe.\n\nIt would have taken an emergency of the greatest proportions for anyone to disturb Herriot during this endeavor. A person who called him out for anything less than a total catastrophe would be tsked and shunned and subject to frosty politeness for some time. Tonight, Herriot belonged to Emily.\n\nOf course, Herriot, being a villager himself, had seen this coming. The uncaring ease in his exaggerated stretching and unhurried rambling had communicated to the villagers that Emily was hale and well. Thus reassured, a festival atmosphere broke out and celebrations were had - though unnoticed by the occupants of the tent. \n\nSeveral months later, Percival acceded to Herriot's firm suggestion that Emily be spayed. It was silently communicated that this would be more for Percival's benefit than Emily's. So this was done, and for years afterward, Emily shared her queenly perch with her son. \n\nAnd so ends the story of wee Emily and her enormous kitten.\n\nThe End\n\n\n(you can find this story and 'The Christmas Day Kitten' here: https://www.amazon.com/James-Herriots-Cat-Stories-Herriot/dp/1250061857)\n", "id": "d6z5kxr"}, {"comment": "I love Herriot, and I'm buying some of his books for my daughter.

For the fresh water line, it includes plumbing hardware (T-junction) that will attach it just after the shutoff valve for a toilet/sink or a clothes washing machine.  The drain is just a hose with an optional U-shaped thing on the end, you can hook it over the side of the toilet or if mounted near a clothes washer it hooks onto the washer drain just like the washing machine's drain hose.  Or for a slightly nicer install you can run it into the sink drain, just get a Branch Tailpiece at home depot, that's a pipe that goes directly below the sink drain but has an extra input (it's what you use to hook up a washing machine to a kitchen sink, but it'll work on most drains).  \n\nThe litter pellets are plastic beads, they're biodegradable (so they don't mess up a septic or sewer) but they don't clump.  The machine scoops out the poo, then rinses the pellets with a soap solution that comes in a cartridge (lasts a few months for one cat, it's cheaper than litter).  Poo gets ground up into the rinse water and it all goes down the drain as a liquidy slurry.  \n\nThe pellets don't scatter really, but some do get tracked out of the bowl.  This is true with any litter box.  The solution is to put a very coarse/rough carpet around the litter box; the rough slightly uneven surface makes the cat spread its paws out which helps the pellets get free.  As long as you vacuum the area around the litter box more than once every two months (which you should be doing anyway) it's not a problem.  \n\nOverall I highly recommend the thing, it makes owning a cat essentially zero maintenance.  Get an automatic feeder too and the cat is ACTUALLY zero maintenance aside from refilling the feeder every now and then.  This also means that if you're going to leave for a couple of days you can leave the cat at home and it'll be fine on its own.

I apologize in advance for the likely unnecessary length of the story.\n\nI was on the way through my town to meet with some friends when I pulled up to one of the busiest intersections in town. While waiting for the light to change I saw a grey kitten running scared in the intersection barely missing getting hit by cars. I couldn't just leave it there so I made the irrational choice to put on my hazards and run into the intersection to get it. Unfortunately the little guy was faster than I was and ended up running underneath a car stopped at the light and crawled into the engine compartment.\n\nTo my benefit an older couple also saw the kitten and stopped to catch it as well. The three of us were frantically trying to tell the driver of the vehicle (who didn't speak English) what was going on and ask her to pop the hood of her car, which she eventually did. When we lifted the hood we saw a little fuzzy face looking at us from in between some hoses. We pried the little one out, closed the hood, got our vehicles out of the intersection, and pulled into a nearby McDonald's. Got a couple cheers from some people watching as well.\n\nSo I get to talking to this couple while holding the kitten by the scruff. We took a minute to figure out what to do with it. I wanted so badly to adopt this kitten, but I was in the middle of moving to a new apartment and would be going on vacation out of state immediately after. There just wasn't a feasible way for me to take it in. That's when the best possible thing happened. The older lady I was talking with told me that her and her husband run a feral cat sanctuary from their home and they'd be willing to watch the kitten for the two weeks I needed. I gave her my number and parted with them and the kitten.\n\nOver the next two weeks I received a call and the occasional picture every couple of days to update me on the kitten's progress. Found out it was a female. Came up with a name thanks to my seven year old niece who was living with me at the time. Pixel von Squish.\n\nFast forward a little bit and the day comes that I bring Pixel to her new home. She's understandable scared and ended up hiding underneath my nightstand. I figure that I'd let her be until she's ready to come out on her own, but my niece wanted to watch the kitten so I leave then alone for a bit. \n\nI checked back about an hour later and my niece is dangling a string for Pixel who is no longer hiding and instead playing. Happy to see that I leave them alone again. Next time I checked on them was an hour later. I looked into my room and see my niece asleep on my bed with little Pixel curled up next to her sleeping as well. It was at that moment I realized that this was gonna work out and I had found a good little buddy.\n\nBonus: A few weeks later I'm laying in bed when Pixel walks past my face. I saw something strange and looked over. I think the exact words I said were \"Those are balls...\" So yeah, turns out the female kitten was actually a boy.

I'm going to give you the abridged version instead, sorry!\n\nFirst off: YOUR CAT IS SO FRIKKING CUTE. Oh my god I seriously just want to kiss her nose bridge so bad.\n\nOkay, back to the question. Is she a Maine Coon or Maine Coon mix? In my opinion, most likely no, because her (adorable) facial features are quite different from the Maine Coon look, which includes tall \"isosceles\" triangle ears set high on the head, fluffy lynx ear tips, a square muzzle, super puffed out whiskerpads, a very angular head shape, and fur distributed in a particular pattern around the face and mane. She has such a petite and smoochable mouth. Gah, I love your kitty's mouth and nose so much. It's just so petite yet strong and kissable idek now I sound like a petaphile.\n\nIt's possible she's a mix even though she doesn't look like one because when you mix breeds the results can come out totally random and weird, but I would not bet money on it, both because of the lack of physical similarity and because cat breeding is actually pretty rare in the US, so finding stray or shelter kitties with any amount of purebred heritage is really uncommon. The thing about purebred cats is that usually people don't let them outside, whether it's because they believe it's unsafe to put that breed outside; because there's a desire to protect their \"investment\"; or because any reputable cat breeder will require the owner to sign a contract stating that they will keep their cat indoor-only. The other reason why it's uncommon to see purebreds or purebred mixes in shelters/strays is because reputable breeders contractually require owners to return any cat they cannot keep back to the breeder, not to a shelter or private rehoming. Of course, there's always kitty mills and backyard breeders with no such ethics who sell their cats to anyone and everyone and dump their unwanted cats, so it's still possible - but again, even counting BYBs and such, cat breeding is relatively uncommon (unlike dog breeding).\n\nI would say classify her as a Domestic Longhair aka a floofitty-mixitty-mix, but who knows. I do know that she's really pretty :)\n\n(Also - notice how I didn't say \"just\" a domestic longhair. I freaking HATE how people put down non-purebred kitties or treat them like they're boring. Um, excuse me?? I have never met a DSH/DLH I didn't think was cute. Literally never. And some of them are truly gorgeous even. I have a DLH myself (and three purebred Ragamuffins) and he is the friendliest, most playful and outgoing cat I've ever had. Personally I think it's *more* special to think about how all of my kitty's ancestors ended up randomly meeting each other and all of those totally chance encounters lead to the creating the unique, one of a kind little guy sitting in front of me. /steps off soapbox)", "id": "d6c410z"}, {"comment": ">  if you're wondering what his coloring is called, it's \"Brown Classic Tabby\". :)\n\nWow before looking into it I thought there were only two types of tabby cat.  \n\n-[chart one](http://www.bengalroyalty.com/_/rsrc/1415379025936/bengal-coats-and-patterns/tabby-types.jpg)\n\n[chart two, so many tabbies](http://img15.deviantart.net/4c7a/i/2014/336/8/8/cat_genetics_tutorial_part_3__tabby_agouti__by_spotted_tabby_cat-d88hoo4.png)\n\n-[Clasic Tabby](http://www.dogforums.com/attachments/other-pets/23090d1294530323-what-type-tabby-photogallery_04112010060631pm5.jpg)\n\n-[Mackerel Tabby](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Mackerel_tabby_cat_pair-Hisashi-01.jpg)\n\n-[Spotted Tabby](http://www.tigerblues.co.uk/userimages/DSC_0858.JPG)\n\n-[Broken Mackerel Tabby](http://www.dogforums.com/attachments/other-pets/23093d1294540399-what-type-tabby-egyptian-mau.jpg)\n\n-[Ticked Tabby](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/ChausieBTT.jpg) \n\n-[Ticked Tabby With Residual Markings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Ticked_tabby_cat_with_residual_markings-Hisashi-01.jpg)\n\n-[Rosetted Tabby](http://www.pets4homes.co.uk/images/classifieds/2015/04/05/927969/large/black-brown-rosetted-bengal-stud-tica-active-5521ba98e8e71.JPG)  \n\n-[Marbled Tabby](http://devinescottishfolds.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/9/5/49955485/5301669_orig.jpg)\n\n-[Candle-Flame Braided Tabby](http://www.catsofaustralia.com/images/Toyger1.jpg)\n\n-Off topic [BEAUTIFUL BICOLOURS - TUXEDO AND MAGPIE CATS](http://messybeast.com/bicolours.htm)\n", "id": "d6bgjqv"}, {"comment": "Yes!

All tests came back normal. His fur is shiny and he isn't malnourished. Little on the skinny side but not grossly underweight. The only real symptoms were that a little bit of blood would usually be mixed in with his stool, and the little patches above his eyes where hair is lighter looked red and patchy, almost like hives from an allergic reaction. We started playing trial and error with his food, eliminated all wet food from his diet for a few weeks and had him on an limited ingredient diet (LID) food with only duck and pea. Bathrooms were clean but he was positively miserable. Plus it's bad to feed a cat only dry food. Anyway, added back LID wet food with tuna/potato. Blood. Eliminated tuna/potato food, back to dry only. Gave him freeze dried tuna and shrimp treats, only ingredient was tuna/shrimp. Blood.  At this point we started to suspect he has a fish allergy, so we eliminate fish and give him LID wet food with no fish/shellfish/chicken, but it had carrageenan. Still blood. Do some research and come across Ziwipeak, introduce this to his diet and after 2 months, not a single bloody bathroom AND the splotches above his eyes have disappeared.\n\nThis trial and error took about a year. Vets may have sped up the process by a few months, but it would have been stressful for him to keep getting poked and prodded at a vet plus very expensive. We may also have never come across Ziwipeak and been feeding him the even more expensive Hills Diet vet brand as an alternative.

I'm allergic and we had outdoor cats when I was growing up.  I loved them, but always had to go wash up right after spending time with them.\n\nI moved to Arizona when I was 39.  A few days after moving in, I went out in the alley and the most pathetic kitten I've ever seen came out from under a car.  A little calico with a terrible coat.  Thin as a rail, with ribs and spine sticking out.  Some fur was missing from malnutrition, she had a few open sores, had to have some bad teeth removed, and she only has about half a tail.\n\nShe looked me right in the eye and walked right towards me.  I put my hand down and she started purring before I petted her.  Then I picked her up, she cuddled in, and I took her inside.  I held her for a couple of hours and realized I now had a cat.  I went and got cat supplies.\n\nShe moved right in and I went on allergy meds.  After 6-8 weeks, I stopped reacting to her.  That made me incredibly happy.  I thought I could never have an indoor cat.  Turns out a lot of other people adjust to cats, too.\n\nMy parents met the calico and went crazy over her.  Mom had to have a knee replaced (which turned out well) and they wanted the calico to keep mom company.  So she lives with them now and she's very spoiled and happy.\n\nNot too long after, a big gray tabby girl showed up in the alley.  She had been dumped.  But she moved right in and has been my baby since.  Then I ended up with three more!  All male and all three are black kitties.  They're the Three Amigos.  Not related, but they're buddies.  And I can live with four cats (and I usually have one on me at all times) and no allergy problems.\n\nOne of the black cats is often on my shoulder or draped over my chest.  He's really a baby.

Any big costs will be those surprise vet visits that you can't plan for but should still expect at some stage.\n\nMy floof has two meals of meat a day and grazes on kibbles. The meat I feed her is kangaroo mince, because I'm in Australia and it's cheaper than beef/chicken/etc. It's also good for them nutritionally - high protein, very low fat. I buy it in 1kg pouches, then portion it out into sandwich bags and freeze them. One pouch costs $10 and lasts around 2wks.\n\nThe kibbles are an Australian brand called Black Hawk. I don't know if they export but I'm sure there's a comparible brand wherever you live. It's an all-natural and 'complete' food, in that she could eat nothing but it and have all her nutritional needs met. I bought a 20kg bag for $90~ when I got my floof almost a year ago. It's still going :) \n\nSo food-wise the cost works out to $30 a month I guess. The other ongoing expense is of course litter. I use a clumping clay that's designed to only be scooped and topped up throughout the week, but only completely replaced every 4wks. A 15kg box costs around $22 and that lasts me around 1.5mths.\n\nSo basically a kitty is pretty affordable for all the benefits you get :3 You just gotta buy in bulk from the big box suppliers, and not buy pre-packaged tinned food that's like $3/meal.

He's been really happy in this window for the last week so they've just kept him there and changed out his blankets. \n\nEDIT: Everyone is asking his story so this is what I know from other volunteers and workers from the shelter. \n\nForrest had a brother named Sunny. Here's them together: http://i.imgur.com/BsVEkgo.jpg\n\nTheir name card on their cage had said: Hi! We are Forest and Sunny, male DLH (domestic long hair) kitties. We were rescued from a hoarding situation. Not much is known about us but we have been very sweet boys here. We need a loving home together.\n\nSunny passed away in January, not sure if from same thing but presumably. So I don't know much about their previous home lives, but they had been in the shelter for awhile. I'd always give them lots of pets when I saw them. They were both so sweet and very timid. After a few months  they got adopted? fostered? by a nice volunteer at their home. But after Forrest's brother passed, she brought him back where he could be monitored at all times of the day.\n\nAs for the care he's receiving, he's in great hands. Since I'm just a volunteer that's there for a few hours each week, I don't see all the behind the scenes but they said he's been doing well, though, so I'm sure they're doing everything they possibly can to ease his pain, and keep him going. I don't know exacts on his treatments, but I know they wouldn't be doing anything that's not in the best interest of him.\n\nMy goal of posting his photos was for him to be loved by this community and remembered. It breaks my heart he didn't have a family, but I guess he kind of did in all of us volunteers that see him all of the time. And now all of you will have a small piece of your hearts that have him there. I'm a sensitive soul to begin with, so seeing any of my furbabies so sick makes me sad. After volunteering for awhile, these kitties become a part of me.  Thanks everyone for all of your kind words about him. \n\nEDIT EDIT: Forrest passed away the morning of April 26. A few hours before my scheduled volunteering shift. Needless to say, I was a sobbing mess. But Forrest has moved on to a greater place.

I'm still getting my prerequisites out of the way as a 33 year old man, but i spend a lot of time at veterinary clinics both for my own pets and working with doctors for my own professional development.    \n\nOne of the things I noticed very quickly was the incredibly high occurrence of renal issues in cats- particularly later in life.  I have inquired with many vets as to why with so many instances of renal issues in felines there isn't more of a drive to further research and improve treatment in that area.  So far, no one has been able to provide me with a satisfactory answer that quells my curiosity.  \n\nThe amount of good that would come from furthering research and better understanding renal issues in felines frankly, to me at least, is something of a no-brainer.  As such, this is likely where I will be spending a substantial portion of my time and energy professionally as soon as scheduling allows.\n\n\nEdit:  Holy smokes!  I came back from writing my last orgo II lab and I am greeted with some of the most encouraging comments I've ever had directed my way!  Thanks to everyone for their encouragement and positivity!  To those of you who are thanking me, I certainly appreciate the sentiment, but I'm going to have to wait until I get where I want to be and have the effect I hope to have before I even consider your gratitude.\n\nTo those who want to make a positive difference in an animal's life- I encourage you to go volunteer at a shelter.  I've found that it was as much fun for me as it was for the cats and dogs I interacted with.  No, really!  \n\nTo those who have lost cats to renal disease, I am sincerely sorry for your loss.  I've seen firsthand how hard it can be.  It was nothing short of gut wrenching to be in the room during some of those later renal stage appointments, so I cannot even imagine how deeply devastating an experience it was for you.  Caring for my own sick animals is what drove me to be a vet, so I am fully aware of how powerful and challenging those times are.  All you can do is your best.\n\nI'd like to encourage everyone to consider adopting an older or senior cat or dog or whatever animal best fits you when the time is right and the opportunity presents itself.  Animals with experience and mileage have a lot to give and they never disappoint in making themselves part of your family in short order if you make them part of yours.

There is so much more that needs to be done in the name of understanding cats. Not just their dietary needs, but their behavioral and social needs as well. While the tide is starting to change in peoples' attitudes towards cat care, from my experience in a a natural pet food store, people are much more willing to understand their dog's needs than they are willing to understand what a cat needs. \n\nWet food, in general, is just so much better for a cat. Raw, in my opinion, is best, but that's not always an option. Cats are actually much more similar to their wild counterparts than dogs are to wolves. Cats' bodies are nourished by protein and fat, and very low levels of carbs. What they can digest of the super high carb-loaded dry food, turns into fat if the cat isn't active enough. So not only is a carb heavy diet not ideal for a cat, it's also overworking the digestive system by constantly feeding the animal something it simply cannot process. To add on to the \"FEED WET FOOD\" idea, you see a lot less kidney and bladder stones as well. Increased water intake dilutes the concentration of the urine, which will lessen the likelihood of buildup of minerals that create crystals, which then create stones. For the kidneys, like /u/kelseykeefe mentioned, increased water intake reduces the amount of work kidneys have to exert to make sure the cat has enough water in their bodies.\n\nBut cats can only receive better care if their owners are willing to educate themselves. The tides are changing, especially as younger people decide that a cat fits their lifestyle better than a dog. The more people are educated on the proper care for a cat, the more the veterinary and various pet industries will begin to treat cats as pets deserving of an equal caliber of care and understanding as dogs.\n\nHere are some good sites to get started with cat nutrition, for those not pursuing a veterinary degree:\n\n* [http://www.catnutrition.org/](http://www.catnutrition.org/)\n\n* [http://feline-nutrition.org](http://feline-nutrition.org/)\n\n* [http://www.catinfo.org](http://www.catinfo.org/)\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "d2bdo2x"}, {"comment": "I wish you luck.

I've spent the last week at a feline only internal medicine specialist and have seen a lot of renal cases. So, here are my five cents.\n\nThere seems to be a misconception that cats on dry diets are dehydrated. It is true that wild cats get water from their diet. But feeding an artificial kibble diet doesn't cause chronic dehydration. The thirst centre in the brain tells the animal to drink enough water for normal function. Unless this centre is damaged, it's pretty unlikely that a cat would dehydrate because of its 100% biscuit diet. If there are no clean water sources available, would the cat be more reluctant to drink? Possibly. But if you were thirsty, wouldn't any water source do? Yes. Is adding water to dry kibble a bad idea? No, so long as it is discarded after x amount of hours. Does it make a difference? I don't think so. The cat would just drink less, as its hypothalamus ordered. \n\nIt's hard to say whether or not renal disease is caused solely by the processed diet we feed.  Have a think about it - you don't hear much about renal disease in wild/feral cats. Why? Probably because we don't look at their water intake, urine output, or urea/creatinine ratio.  Then again, wild cats don't live anywhere as long as their domesticated counterparts. Getting bitten, eaten, hit by a car... There's a lot that will end the animal's life while its organs are still in good shape. \n\nMy point is that renal disease may simply be geriatric change. You would certainly be worried if a 5 year old cat had renal issues, because relative to its age, every organ system should be working fairly well. A 20 year old cat though - it's likely to have renal disease, hyperthyroidism, and some degree of osteoarthritis. How severe varies individually, but from my experience, it is just part of getting old with decreased organ function.

I have 3 cats total and they were all covered. We started with natural remedys but couldn't get the fleas to go away. Finally we resorted to the heavy stuff...I think we did Frontline. Could she of had a bad reaction to this and it looked like kidney failure? BTW, she is about 14 years old.\n\nMy cats split half a can of wet food in the morning and always have dry food available. I bought a cat fountain that we keep upstairs in my bedroom(the food is downstairs in the kitchen), they all love the fountain and drink tons from it. Any suggestions on good wet food?

Your pet's skin is very delicate and thinner than yours, so if your pet is severely matted, it may be wise to consult a professional groomer.\n\nSmaller mats can be broken apart with a mat rake or matbreaker. Larger, more involved mats must be cut out with scissors. Be careful. It is easy to cut your pet.\n\nTo groom a pet with mats:\n\nFirst, note where mats are on your pet and brush around them, getting loose and dead hair out of the hair coat.\nUsing a mat rake or matbreaker, slowly saw through each mat starting at the end of it, slowly working your way deeper into the mat.\nBe patient and attentive to your pet's comfort. Do not attempt to pull the mat out by hand.\nSome mats look worse than they are, since they may not involve the undercoat. These are easy to fix. Break up the top layer with a matbreaker and comb out the undercoat.\nAgain, pets with larger mats, mats close to the skin, or mats which cause extreme discomfort should have the mats removed by a professional groomer.\"\n\nTo simplify it, mat breakers don't work on their own; they break apart to mat so you can comb and brush the rest if it out. It does still pull on the skin a little, and you should NEVER use to remove extensive matting, like on the cat in the picture. You could cut, tear, or seriously injure the skin trying to de-mat a very matted coat. Cats have thin skin, especially old cats. This kitty would need a groomer to clip it down.\n\nThat being said, if your pet gets mats here and there, mat breakers are great for keeping your pet tangle free with minimal discomfort.

I come home from work and it makes such a difference, seeing their friendly faces.  Right now they are my only friends.  I know that sounds pathetic but it's just the way it worked out.  Single parenting, working a lot, two divorces and friends just sort of fell by the wayside somehow.  My fault, I didn't have a lot of spare time and what spare time I had I spent with my kids who are grown and great people leading busy lives.  I am obsolete.\n\nI am so sorry to have dumped that here.  I'm  wallowing in a vat of self pity today.  ", "id": "d5rgyd9"}, {"comment": "Please don't feel that you're obsolete.  I don't know you or your kids, but I am in my 30s now and don't talk to/see my parents as much as I used to.  I am about to move to another country and will be even further from them.  But they are always on my mind and I know that they have formed the core of who I am.\n\nI went through a bad divorce myself and my parents were incredibly supportive.  They come from a traditional Indian background, had an arranged marriage, yet did not make me feel bad about divorcing my non-Indian husband.  When people remarked on my resilience during the divorce, I knew that it was largely in part to the support that I had in my life.  It was also very much due to the resilience I had learned from them, seeing how they dealt with challenges in their own lives.\n\nI enjoy working with underprivileged populations, people with mental health problems, or those in crisis.  It doesn't pay well, and is probably not what my parents had in mind for me.  But their hard work and sacrifices have put me in a position where I am able to choose that life for myself.  Not a day goes by where I am not grateful for that.  They gave me the freedom of choice.  When people compliment my generosity or empathy, they are also complimenting my parents.\n\nIt's not the sort of thing I tell my parents all the time.  I get frustrated with them, don't always have time to see them, and am busy building a life with my husband.  But they will never be obsolete to me.  They are an ever present part of who I am today and the life that I lead.\n\nOn another note, I was not into cats at all and only agreed to get one for my ex-husband's sake.  I did a lot of research (because I believe in a high responsibility when it comes to pet ownership) and then we got the cat.  By the time we got divorced, all I really cared about was keeping the cat.\n\nI don't think there's anything pathetic about how you feel about your cats.  My cat is the best thing about every day.  He made that first empty apartment not seem so lonely.  When I started dating again, I knew that if the date went poorly, I was happy to come home and watch Netflix with my cat purring contentedly on me.  I don't think it's pathetic at all.  I'm married again now, I've always had lots of friends, but there are still days I'd pick my cat over the company of anyone else!\n\nHang in there, and message me if you ever need non-cat company.

I have a 16 year old tortie who had a hard life before I adopted her at age 6 or 7. I also had a cat that I adopted at 3 weeks. Both ate good food, got vet care, etc. The one I adopted at 3 weeks died at 4 from liver failure. The vet couldn't figure out where it came from, but since two of our cat's other litter mates also died young, they thing there was some kind of inborn error of metabolism.

My family *loves* cats, but we kept them mostly outside because dad and I are allergic.  It worked out well, they had plenty of food and love, and the house has a patio that is nearly enclosed.\n\nWhen I moved to Arizona a weird little calico kitten turned up in the alley.  She was in bad shape.  Her coat was stiff and she was losing hair from malnutrition.  Some open sores and had to have a few bad teeth pulled.  And she only has about half of a tail.  But extremely friendly and affectionate.\n\nShe latched onto me immediately, so I picked her up and took her inside.  Sat down and held her for an hour and realized I now had a cat.  I went and got her food, a box, a few toys, and all the rest.  She ate and ate and ate, and I got her fixed up.\n\nAfter about six weeks, I noticed that she didn't bother my allergies any longer.  I got used to her and then I looked around the Internet and found that the same thing happened to other people, too.\n\nSince, the calico went to live with my parents.  Mom had to have a knee replaced and wanted a little friend to keep her company during recovery.  Mom and dad had met the calico and went crazy, so she went to live with them.  They love her and so do all the neighbors.\n\nAnd I'm not lonely.  For some reason, I ended up with *four* male black cats moving in.  Wasn't planned, each just happened.  They're the sweetest boys.  I got the most recent a month ago and he's about 12 weeks old.  The other three already love him and he's cuddled up with me right now.  He makes me sneeze now and then, but I'll be used to him in December.  Totally worth it.", "id": "d9vpynw"}, {"comment": "Truth!! I am allergic to cats, too.

For about 8 or 10 years, I fed him Royal Canin dry food (due to another cat having crystals forming in his bladder and I couldn't separate the food).  Several years ago, when \"studies\" showed that canned (wet) food was actually better, I switched my cats to a primarily canned food diet (they were delighted).  :-)  In the last couple of years, I pretty much fed him whatever he wanted - Fancy Feast, plain roasted chicken, tuna, even salmon for the last few weeks.  I was happy to spoil him.

Sorry for the long answer, but it was a long life.  :-)", "id": "d36crko"}, {"comment": "Haha thank you for the answer :) I hope my cats live this long! \n\nI asked about food, because I was curious about whether it does have a link to how long they live. Terribly small sample size, but I'm sure it does.\n\nKinda like, if you fed 100 humans McDonald's everyday, some probably would live to a reasonable age, but the majority would develop some health issues.\n\nBut the fact you changed to better quality food, I'm sure it improved his overall health and length of life! \n\nI actually get my cats food from Germany (I live in England), as it's supposed to be one of the best in the world. So I'm hoping it will give them as long a life as yours! :) ", "id": "d36d826"}, {"comment": "You are probably right.  I just try to do the best for their all-around care - stress-free life, vet care, spay/neuter, outside time ONLY WHEN IT'S SAFE AND SUPERVISED, the best food that I can convince them to eat (none of them showed any real fondness for any of the \"natural\" canned food I tried, but I do offer them Blue natural dry cat food), lots of affection (kinda tricky when, at one point, I had 9 cats!).

I had him for about 12 years, I got him as a kitten from my dad as a bday present when I turned 7.\n\nPlease adopt a pet if you can because at least you will be giving it a good life. Don't be scared of the pain, you will survive it.\n\nEdit: Added pics of the cats.\n\nEdit: [And here's a small album of the new kitty.](http://imgur.com/a/WEQzh)\n\nEdit: [Here's more!](http://imgur.com/a/JE69V)\n\nEdit: [Album of the first cat](http://imgur.com/a/6JOad)", "id": "dar63tp"}, {"comment": "Sounds like you need your own cat. :)", "id": "dara4f1"}, {"comment": "Living in fear is no way to live!

She never bothered my allergies and when I looked it up, it was because the breed doesn't have the same allergen.  Currently, I have an Oriental Shorthair who is the same way.\n\nThough I do think it's worth developing resistance to ordinary cats.  The most cuddly one I've ever had is a little black cat who showed up as a feral kitten.  He's a shoulder cat.

Please note that individual cats may vary, depending on socialization and temperament. Mine was the son of a feral cat, so he was probably more wild than most.\n\n1. It's the equivalent of you walking around your apartment/house in your underwear. They are comfortable in their own space, but if someone were to unexpectedly intrude, even for benign reasons, they would react dramatically. Now it'd be weird for you to start biting and clawing at your room-mate who should be at work, but it's normal for cats.\n\n2. It's a method of defense. If a cat rolls over on their belly when being bugged by another animal such as an agressive littermate a curious dog, they are getting ready to claw the hell out of the other should they approach. All four limbs are in attack position. They are putting their dukes up.\n\n3. It's a sign of trust. The cat likes you and wants you to rub the belly. To tell the difference between this and the other possible meanings, check the eyes, ears, and tail. swishy tail, twitchy ears, and open, wide eyes means it's fear/playful defense. They are looking for a fight. If the eyes are closed, they are possibly oblivious to your presence. Rub their head a bit. If they then roll over, no belly rubs on peril of bites. If they stretch some more and purr, belly rubs.

Imagine if someone lightly brushed against your bare back vs. rubbing it. Of course don't press as hard as you would with a person, but don't be afraid to apply real pressure. That will feel like rubbing not tickling. \n\nSome prerequisites: usually the cat needs to be familiar with you. It almost never works to run a cats belly if it doesn't trust you. \n\nTip: If the cat opens its mouth like it's going to bite you say \"Hey!\" really loud without moving your hand.

Thank you for subscribing to cat facts. Please note that individual cats may vary, depending on socialization and temperament. Mine was the son of a feral cat, so he was probably more wild than most.\n\n1. It's the equivalent of you walking around your apartment/house in your underwear. They are comfortable in their own space, but if someone were to unexpectedly intrude, even for benign reasons, they would react dramatically. Now it'd be weird for you to start biting and clawing at your room-mate who should be at work, but it's normal for cats.\n\n2. It's a method of defense. If a cat rolls over on their belly when being bugged by another animal such as an agressive littermate a curious dog, they are getting ready to claw the hell out of the other should they approach. All four limbs are in attack position. They are putting their dukes up.\n\n3. It's a sign of trust. The cat likes you and wants you to rub the belly. To tell the difference between this and the other possible meanings, check the eyes, ears, and tail. swishy tail, twitchy ears, and open, wide eyes means it's fear/playful defense. They are looking for a fight. If the eyes are closed, they are possibly oblivious to your presence. Rub their head a bit. If they then roll over, no belly rubs on peril of bites. If they stretch some more and purr, belly rubs. Keep an eye on the ears and tail though, cats can't really say 'stop' ('nonononono' or 'nlumnlumnlumnlum' sure, but not 'stop') and are likely to respond by biting if you ignore the warning signs.", "id": "d86aai4"}], [{"comment": "starfish kitty hnnnnnng", "id": "d85p6qt"}], [{"comment": "Pickles is definitely the best name ever.", "id": "d862ypf"}, {"comment": "Except if it's a dog named Mr. Pickles then I wouldn't want to be near that dog", "id": "d86hzoj"}], [{"comment": "it's workinggggggg", "id": "d85tkuw"}], [{"comment": "It's a trap!! *Insert admiral ackbar here*", "id": "d85wejs"}], [{"comment": "can i volunteer as tribute! :D \ud83d\ude4b", "id": "d85wgtu"}], [{"comment": "That's one pretty kitty!

Hormonal changes cause them to have increased appetite in the autumn and winter. \n\n> Have you tried overfeeding a cat? Cause it's just going be a waste of cat food in most cases.\n\nObviously I've not deliberately tried to overfeed a cat but, many cats, including one we had, are very happy to eat too much and eat what they are given. Others stop eating when they have had enough. It's just like people: some people's appetite means they eat too much and end up overweight while others don't have the urge to eat more than they need.\n\n> And how do you measure their intake for them? A cat's caloric requirement varies massively, depending on activity.\n\nGetting it roughly right, as long as it is enough (so, on the high side) and then reducing it slightly until they start to slowly lose weight if they are overweight.\n\n> But what's the point in having a cat if you're going to try to control it? That's a depressed cat in the making.\n\nCats early enjoy jumping and running around. Overweight cats are more likely to be depressed than ones on diets I think.\n\nI think it is important to try and give your cat food that satisfies them. Food full of carbohydrates has a lot of calories but, probably doesn't make them feel full, just like with humans. It is also bad for them - they are less adapted than humans to eating carbohydrates.

Our other cat wasn't able to get near \"her\" couch without her going mental on his ass. Was not a good match. \n\nEventually, she just disappeared one day. We lived in a forest and although she never went outside (by her choice), we think she may have gotten sick and wandered outside to die. As supposedly cats do. Was rather unfortunate, no one really noticed she went missing for a couple weeks since she didn't interact with any one (never slept in anyone's room, only thing she ever did was sleep on that couch and eat). \n\nBut it seems our remaining cat has not been too worse for wear. Nowadays my parents have 4 more kids under the age of 3 or 4 who are fascinated by the \"kitty\" and give him lots of love.\n\nquick edit: As for why we never put her on a diet, the male cat was super skinny. And the female cat was also very angry about the food dish when she was near it. So he was only able to eat when she wasn't around, nor did he even seem very interested in ever eating so we couldn't feed him on demand. If we didn't leave food out 100%, we worried he could get sick from malnutrition. We never were able to adopt away the female cat because she was my brothers, while the male cat was mine. Nowadays he is a healthy weight. \n\nquick edit 2: Her name was Tiny for anyone interested. Not even sarcastically named. We had her from when she was a very small kitten, and my brother being 8 or so was not very creative with his naming (also had a hermit crab named Shelly and one of those climbing geckos named sticky), named her after being so small. She was always a small framed cat but that didn't stop her from becoming so morbidly obese later on her stomach touched the floor when she walked. \n\nquick edit 3: She also became obese practically over night.

So my mom comes up to visit me from California for the day and I'm out of the Apartment with my girlfriend at the time and my mom while my roommate and his girlfriend do their own thing. I come back to the apartment late evening and our needy yet crochety cat is freaking the fuck out outside my roommate's closed door to his room. And my roommate comes out and says to me \"I've done something terrible\" and \"I'm like what did you do.\" And I here this high pitched meow and chirp behind him, and I was \"what did you do!\" He and his girlfriend had bought another cat that day after she said that she simply wanted to go to a local shelter to look at cats for fun. I was bewildered for split second as you know we had been living together and become able to discuss big decisions before buying another animal. But all that confusion went away as he handed me this scrawny little black cat that immediately started to purr aggressively while chirping and butting my face and my heart simply melted, and I still had to act like I was mad at my roommate and I was like \"fine I guess we can keep her as long as I get to name her\". \n\nBy then of the four years of living together in that 900 sq. Ft. Apt, we had 3 cats (Edison, Elsa, and Artemis), a ferret (we called him furret), a White German Shepherd Dog (Luna), and at least 3 goldfish. \n\nMoral of the story, stay away from shelters unless you want to get a pet because even if you don't want to, you will get a pet, it's like doing hardcore drugs, maybe using it will or will not will lead to you getting addicted.

I find it much easier, because you can tell exactly where you are cutting off so you aren't scared of cutting into the quick. These will be labeled as small animal clippers often at the store, but sometimes they can be labeled for cats. The ones for dogs, I consider too bulky. \n\nNow, I've never cut into my cat's quick, but I also have quite a bit of experience. I used to own a guinea pig, who I did once cut into the quick and who had dark nails. See through nails are much easier to avoid the quick.\n\nNow, if you do, stay calm and apply some syptic powder, corn starch or baking powder and pack it onto the nail. Apply pressure using a cotton ball or bandage. \n\nAnyway, I consider trimming their nails as as the most viable option. There is those silly 'nail covers' which are kind of ridiculous, I'd imagine a hassle, and theres no way your cat likes 'em.

I had no idea how he could have gotten out or where he would have gone. I walked out of my apartment into the staircase to look around for him, and as I was speaking to a maintenance worker for the building, my downstairs neighbour comes into the hall holding Otto, saying \"I found him in my living room.\" It seems like Otto was sneaky enough to open the cupboard, move a board covering a hole in the wall, and then snuck behind it into the guts of the house. \n\nThen he ended up in another person's apartment! Crazy, I know-- but it's possible, and if this cat was found in an apartment building with other units, and no one knows how the cat got there, I'd consider that this *could* be the case.
