It was 2 AM, and neither Karl or I had money for a cab. We figured we had to walk. After walking for half an hour we hear a car coming from behind us. We quickly put our thumbs up, but the car drives past us. Saying our curses we notice the car stops about 50 meters in front of us and starts to reverse. We run up and the driver rolls down the passenger window. \n\n\"Hey, where ya going?\" said the old, bald man.\n\n\"We're going to Bergen.\"\n\n\"I'll take you\"\n\nThe moment I sat my ass in that car, was the moment my life would be fucked.\nThe second I buckle up, Frank begins to babble. He took this as his moment to shine. After listening to his life story for about 20 minutes he starts to sound weird. Saying shit that just can't be true. He tells us that his sister laid a chicken egg and he wanted us to come and look at the hen it had produced. We politely declined but he was persistent. Pedal to the metal through the forest road and to his farm. We started to threaten him but he was old, and we didn't want to hit an old guy, so we eventually ended up on his farm. On the way we learn that his sister was pretty disabled, and spent the days alone with the animals. One day he had found an egg in his sisters bed, and he got curious, so he marked it and left it with the hens so he could see what it turned into. Frank was amazed that it actually hatched and that his sister had given birth to a chicken. He had kept it because it was his sisters only way to have children, since she would never meet a man. They named him Kykk.\n\nWe get out and Frank takes us in the main door, up the stairs and to the left where we felt a sharp scent. When the lights were turned on from a motion sensor we hear a cackle followed by Frank freaking the fuck out. We rush in and find Franks sister dead on the floor in a pool of her own manure. And a hen, Kykk, standing on top of her body. Frank was quick to name the hen culprit in the murder and ran to kill it. But the moment he reached for the neck of the murderous chicken he collapsed. It was an ugly scene. We freaked the fuck out and Karl, in his panic, grabbed the chicken and ran towards the exit. Franks car was still in the driveway and it didn't take us more than a minute to reach the main road again, only this time in a car with a chicken companion. We ditch the car about one kilometer from out apartment and walked the rest.\n\nYears pass, and as the bachelor I was I stayed with Karl, my labrador puppy Brutus, a stray kitten we took in and Kykk. One day during a storm I go down the basement to check on the animals and I find Kykk shielding the doggo and the kitten. I went over to lay beside them. Suddenly I heard the chicken begin to cackle like crazy. I was panicking and asked it what was wrong. \"Imma need about tree fiddy\".

", "id": "d2y0ugh"}, {"comment": "I've worked with a lot of aggressive dogs and have helped people train their pets to be social animals. I can tell you how to do it, but it's up to you to follow through. It will not happen over night. \n\nAlso, have treats on hand. Nothing crunchy or chewy, it's needs to be something soft and something they can eat quickly (so there's no mess they may want to work at, and no prolonged chewing that will distract them from training). I suggests hot dogs or string cheese. \n\nFirst you need to teach your dog the \"watch me command\", then the leave it command. Leash your dog and stand somewhere comfortable and quiet. Have some treats in your pocket. Say his name and then \"watch me\" and bring the treat to your face. The VERY INSTANT your dog makes eye contact, give him the treat (I suggests hot dogs!). Do this over and over until you can do it without treats. Do this a few times a day. This teaches your dog to pay attention to you and will help redirect their attention from something else to you. \n\nNext, work on leave it. Do this by putting something he likes on the floor, food or toy. Leash him and walk near the object. When he looks at it or tries to go for it, say \"leave it\" followed by \"watch me\". The instant he looks at you, treat him. Get closer and closer each time. Do this until you can be right on top of the said object. \n\nNow that you have taught the watch me and leave it command, you get to use them to help socialize your dog with strangers. \n\nYou need a willing participant to help you. You'll need them to have another (leashed) dog (preferably a trained one who can ignore your dog). Start on opposite ends of the street, and walk towards eachother (dogs should be across the street). Anytime your dog lunges, barks at, or stares at the other dog, say leave it and watch me to redirect the attention on you. When you can walk on opposite ends of the street without a reaction, have one person walk in the middle of the street (works best on quiet neighborhood roads). This cuts the distance between dogs in half. Continue to exercise leave it and watch me. Eventually, move in until you both share the same sidewalk. \n\nWhen your dog can do this without reacting, you have a dog that is now able to be controlled more so than he was before in a social setting. Your dog knows the leave it and watch me command very well now (or he should...). Ensure your partners dog is not dog aggressive or possessive when on leash. They must be calm. This is beneficial when just training a dog how to socialize.\n\nBegin the process by walking up to eachother. Exercise the leave it and watch me commands. When you are within arms reach, sit your dogs by your sides. (dogs should be on your left sides, or opposite eachother, not face to face) Shake hands and greet the person. Now carry on and walk past like you're continuing your day. Praise your dog if they've done well. If not, try it again. This teaches your dog that they can not always greet another animals, and that's okay! They learn to be patient. \n\nWhen your dog can do this well, do the same exercise again, and once you finish saying hello to your partner, ease up on the leashes and allow the dogs to greet. If your dog is over eager, pulling at the leash, or showing an aggression, correct the behavior and say leave it. Then walk away. \n\nDo this until your dog can safely, and appropriately, greet the other dog. \n\nCongratulations! You've taught your dog how to greet another dog on leash! Socialization is a continuous process, so it's important to do it throughout life and with many different dogs. This is only one method of teaching proper greeting, and it may not always work for you and your dog.\n\nIf you are having serious troubles with your pet, please seek out a behavioralist that focuses on positive reinforcement.

If you go the shelter route, start by asking them which dog(s) they think would fit your lifestyle. Tell them your activity level and how often you're home. This will help them, as they know the dogs better than anyone. Of course, this varies by shelter, and some are better at this than others. \n\nDo you want anything specific? Coat length? Age? Energy level? Breed(s)? Size? Keep these things in mind to help narrow your search. If none of this matters, you will have more options. Always ask about the history of the pet, as you don't want a dog with a history of biting children.\n\n How old are your children? I find for younger kids, bigger dogs are better and not as likely to snap if they accidentally do something the dog doesn't like (little dogs tend to be more \"at the ready\" to defend themselves do to their size - but there are exceptions to this generalization). \n\nBefore you ever get a dog, teach your children how to behave around a dog. No hitting, pulling, hugging, squeezing, stepping on, laying on, Etc. This seems like common sense, but it isn't always for the children. You can talk to them about it, but make sure to take them out and see a neighbors pet and physically teach them what's appropriate (how to calmly pet a dog, where to touch them (head and back for dogs you don't know as well), not crowd the dog, keep your face out of the dog's face, etc). \n\nIt's important they know these things so when they see a really cute dog at the shelter, they don't run up to it and start making it nervous. \n\nAgain, when you go, bring your children. If you want to go alone the first time to scout out the area, that's fine. But before you even check any boxes or fill out your name, bring your kids with you.

But modern studies of dogs and wolves show that this concept we have of an \"Alpha\" is incorrect.

Similarly dogs look to their owners as parents, looking for guidance. If a dog is being \"dominant\" it simply means that it is not trained well. An example I read is if dogs pull on their leashes hard to go in the direction they want to go, they are only trying what has worked for them in the past. \n\nTrying to assert dominance over your dog, may actually be mistreating the dog  since the dog really only wants to please you as its parent.

I mean, sure, kids (as well as dogs) need a lot of cuddles, but when you're a parent it's also your job to feed, clothe and protect your them, show them what's appropriate behavior and what isn't. If you're in a situation, say you're going to ride a train, you as the parent will be the one who buys tickets, make sure you're on the right platform at the right time, that your kid doesn't fall down on the rails etc. If you as an adult couldn't handle that your kids would probably try and step up to handle the situation instead, just like a dog would. It wouldn't mean that the kid is being \"dominant\", it's just trying to help keep the family as a unit safe because the parent is inadequate in that situation. Just think of all the children who grocery shops, cooks, cleans etc at home because their mom and/or dad suffers from substance abuse, mental illness or something else that makes them unable to do those things. And those kids usually also tries to protect their parents.

I get that meat is delicious (went to my grandparents recently and the beef pie smelt great) but I'm 100% sure my dinner was tastier to me. I think a big part of it is also that your tastes change when you change the food you it, if youve ever cut out something like white bread or just stuff with loads of sugar in in general, when you have the slightest taste of that thing it's overwhelming. Same goes for meat and cheese. When I get a slight taste of fatty, salty stuff (some vegan variety) I taste it really intensely and I only need a little to feel good, I think this is massively underestimated by people who are scared of cutting meat out. \n\nAnyway, take from this what you will, and keep being a cool person.", "id": "d4gzzmu"}, {"comment": "As the philosopher Jeremy Bentham famously wrote in 1789:\n\n> The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor.

He's incredibly careful about accidentally nipping when he grabs for the toy to get a better position. For a dog with \"the strongest jaw\" getting bit by him scares me 100x less than an accidental bite by our other dog because she has zero bite inhibition. She can't recognize a toy from a hand in her mouth. He's incredibly careful. \n\nNow with my husband he is much more of a fighter. We like to tape him playing with me and then playing with my husband. Two different dogs. He puts his full weight behind him and is a lot more careless because he knows my husband can handle it.

It is especially sweet because he is a rescue with problems and we were told to not get another dog with him. Before we brought in a puppy we introduced them and he immediately just knew she was a baby. He knew she had to be taken care of. From day one he preened her. He played with her extremely gently. She is his dog far before she is our dog. It creates some problems as well (he is super friendly when she isn't around, but if she is he is very protective. We have had to do a lot of work with him.)\n\nWhen he plays with me he is a little rougher than he is with Reagan, but not nearly as rough as he is with my husband. He's incredibly careful about accidentally nipping when he grabs for the toy to get a better position. For a dog with \"the strongest jaw\" getting bit by him scares me 100x less than an accidental bite by our other dog because she has zero bite inhibition. She can't recognize a toy from a hand in her mouth. He's incredibly careful. \n\nNow with my husband he is much more of a fighter. We like to tape him playing with me and then playing with my husband. Two different dogs. He puts his full weight behind him and is a lot more careless because he knows my husband can handle it.

Later that evening I saw a humming bird hovering around and bouncing his beak into the porch light outside my apartment while this violent wind storm was blowing.  After I finished my laundry an hour later he was still there; looked exhausted and bewildered.  I offered him a branch from a house plant and he perched on it, but he still seemed entranced by the light and would do periodic laps around it.  Pretty soon I just brought the branch with him on it into my apartment, turned off all the lights except a night light on an extension cord, and put the potted plant and the night light on a shelf in the corner of my closet.  I even went out, bought, and hung a hummingbird feeder on the wall in case he got hungry.  I was really worried he would have used up all his energy and might die before morning.  I don't think he ever drank any nectar, but he did go to sleep (torpor), and the next morning before dawn I pulled up the blinds, opened the window, and took out the screen.  I watched him wake up from the corner of my bed, and after he had a stretch I tried turning on the light in the closet.  He did a lap around that light then returned to his perch.  Then I turned on the light in the bedroom and turned off the closet light.  He came out, buzzed the bedroom light, and when I turned that light off he saw the light from the window and zoom he was gone.  Although I didn't see a lot of signs of intelligence there I like to think he was grateful for a night's rest.  I figure he had a nest or favorite night perch in that tree, and he was lost when it fell down, got chopped up, and hauled away.  He was the only critter who had a worse day than me because of that storm, and you know, us living creatures have to stick together and help each other when we can.", "id": "d52a5ji"}, {"comment": "What a sweet story :-)", "id": "d52ajz4"}], [{"comment": "This would not work out well with my dog.

Her father drowned himself in the Hudson River after the 2008 financial melt down threatened to end him up in prison. Claire and her mother, who had both cut off contact with him years earlier, both received staggering amounts of money after his death because even though they hated him, and even though he knew he was not a good man, he never stopped loving his family and made sure to secure their futures. It would never make up for the years of detachment after Claire was born, or for what happened with him and Claire's 16 year old babysitter, but he refused to not do his best for them. \n\nRescuing the chicken was only the last of a long string of attacks Clair perpetrated until the heat got to be too much and she paid a man named x2 ten thousand in cash to make her into Alicia. Claire spends her free time building and fine tuning Alicia. Claire used to read peter singer religiously, Alicia's favorite books are the twilight series. Claire once punched a man in the face while holding a roll of quarters, Alicia does everything in her power to avoid confrontation. Claire had sex with multiple partners of all genders and a new one each week, Alicia is just hoping to meet a nice man and settle down. Until now only four people knew about Claire, and if she sees this i fear there may be one less. When Alicia was a little girl, she used to play house with her little brother, her little brother died last year in a freak accident and Alicia is known to cry every time she sees someone at the animal shelter who looks like him. \n\nThere is no telling what Claire/Alicias next move might be. Recently she has started occasionally going to the library, finding a quiet corner, and reading works by renowned environmentalists and radicals. She also recently joined PETA, and has used her cell phone to look up information on ELF, her user name on the forum is Roo5ever. \n\nAlicia knows who is posting this. And if she finds it, she will either solve the problem or become someone new. Solving the problem is the easier route though, so it's more likely. Whatever bastard she sends though, they better come correct. I don't fear death, and in some ways look forward to it. I'm very tired. But I also don't plan to go down without talking her or someone she paid with me. I can only hope to god you finally show a little courage and come yourself, I think you say least owe me that...\n\nMy voice is getting tired from such a long post.

While this sounds good, BJWT currently has less than 100 acres of land for the cats, of which they have about 200. This means each cat has less than half an acre (2 km^2 ) of land.  \nOn their social media pages they frequently share lots of pictures and videos, but as someone else pointed out these regularly only feature about ~10 or so different cats. Now you know they actually have 200 cats there, it raises the question of why are none of the other 190 cats ever shown? Are they all treated with the same constant love and affection too? New cubs are shown being brought in fairly often, but then they're not shown again, they go back to the usual cats. BJWT isn't open to normal people like you and I, so we can't know for sure what's going on there. Only famous celebrities get to visit there usually. They're not even registered as a sanctuary.\n\n*****\n\nPersonally, I've followed his Instagram account for quite some time and still do actually, but learning all this has given me a lot of doubt about the whole thing. As the article I will link below points out, Eduardo (the owner/founder) seems to be a very nice and well-meaning guy, but possibly deluded in thinking that giving all his love and attention to the cats is actually helping and is good for them in the long run, there's probably studies on this but obviously it's nothing like how it would be in the wild.\n\nIf you have the time and actually care then it's probably best to research it yourself as OP said. A good starting article would be The Daily Beast's write up: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/01/07/hollywood-s-favorite-sham-petting-zoo.html  \nThat article links to a couple of fairly detailed reports that believe BJWT is a big scam.  \nAnother (apologies for a Gawker link but it's actually a good write up): http://gizmodo.com/this-celebrity-studded-instagram-petting-zoo-is-a-disas-1750359929  \nOne of the linked articles is now 404ing, archive here: https://web.archive.org/web/20160412215220/http://www.jacalynbeales.com/outofwilderness/2015/12/22/fooling-millions-with-false-conservation-the-black-jaguar-white-tiger-foundation\n\nFor the other side of the argument you pretty much just need to read all the pages on BJWT's [official site](http://blackjaguarwhitetiger.org/) which explains all the good work they do.", "id": "d5k5yu3"}, {"comment": "I don't get the impression that he is a nice guy, unfortunately.

He will even specifically shame them, e.g. he made a post saying one person who questioned him was an animal rights activist, but that person only has a few hundred followers compared with his millions so that activist is a loser who is doing nothing for the world and isn't allowed to question him. \n\nHis foundation has been criticized for not being an official sanctuary with all of the proper bureaucracy and animal care (e.g. the way people interact with the animals is considered improper), and he disregards all of these warnings and statements as coming from \"haters.\" He seems more interested in making videos of the cubs in his home than giving them the proper care.

Even zoos do not entirely understand how they act on the animals who are injected. In other cases, implants are injected for contraception. What isn\u2019t widely discussed in regard to implants is that unless the animal is cut open every six months, and the prior implant removed, a new implant is simply inserted alongside the old one. Meaning that over the course of the its lifetime, a cat might wind up with dozens of contraception implants under her skin. And no one is sure what sort of side effects this might have on their health.\n\nEduardo uses the term \u201cinjections\u201d however, in my own research on the matter of contraception, I found that the term \u2018injection\u2019 was used interchangeably between literal injections of fluid contraception, and implants which are injected under the skin with a large gauge needle, so there\u2019s no way to know for sure which type BJWT uses. What we do know, is that chemical contraception for big cats in general is considered tricky, with dosages requiring constant adjustment, and the long term side effects remain unknown. Overall, if one is trying to reduce the population of captive, privately owned big cats, it remains much more cost effective and efficient to simply spay and neuter the animals.\"\nhttps://projecticarus2015.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/escaping-the-matrix/\n\nSpaying is the only effective birth control for big cats, and he's alluded to wanting them to have more children in order to re-populate the wild.

As long as they're healthy and happy I don't see the problem.  BCR  tries to recreate their wild environment as much as possible which is obviously much better but this dude just seems to have a different philosophy from BCR, I don't think he loves his cats any less.\n> \n> They all seem to agree that he's genuine in his motivation to help the cats, but is just misguided and a little delusional about the risks of getting attacked. Still, it's his ass on the line so I'm not worried. At the end of the day he provides the cats a better home than the shitty circuses he gets them from. Though I'd be upset if he gets attacked and they put the animal down, not sure how that works though.\n> \n> The third criticism is something that also applies to Big Cat Rescue, they photograph and film their cats all the time. I also know of other conservation programs that let their animals be filmed and photographed because it brings in money they desperately need. \n> \n> I wouldn't give him money though tbh.

It is INSANELY tempting...but we don't do it, because history has taught us it's a road straight to hell and the destruction of everything we've worked for.\n\nThere are good reasons this kind of physical contact is either illegal or will get your accreditation revoked from reputable organizations, and it's not just because someone else is super worried about one idiotic person's safety. It's not really a matter of \"well if Johnny wants his dick bit off, he can choose to take that risk\".\n\nIt basically says: \"I care more about looking cool than establishing a stable future for the animals in my care.\"\n\nThe apparent overcrowding, refusal to use birth control methods, and seeming inability to say \"no\" to the opportunity to bring in new cubs, all also say the same thing.

If you like what you see, drop some bucks. For these places, donations tend to have more immediate, visible impact (like literally paying for the food the animals eat that month).\n\nNote that these are different than animal \"sanctuaries\", which in my experience tend to have a much wider variation in quality and sketchiness versus purity.

We didn't know about any of this when we got our first golden and we ended up paying $600 for her from a backyard breeder.\n\nWe loved her, she was an awesome dog, but over her lifespan the medical bills due to genetic issues exceeded $10,000.  We had to do two knee replacement surgeries, she had arthritis and hip displacia as well as a twisted spine.  She couldn't walk at age two and we did a last ditch effort of getting her acupuncture (after our vet gave up and said it's the only idea they had short of euthanasia) which amazingly worked.  Much of this was due to the breeding approach (or lack there of) by the breeder and these sorts of lousy breeders contribute to the overall genetic issues that the golden retriever breed is facing.\n\nAs it is, with good breeding practices, goldens have a 60% likelihood of having cancer in their lifetimes (though interestingly they have the same life expectency of similar sized breeds), as well as a tendency towards hip displacia.  Even our breeder, who has never had a joint issue, does not advertise that fact and says she feels like it's as much luck as anything that she hasn't had a litter with joint issues.  She just knows that once she does she will trace the genetics that caused it and sterilize that line so it can't happen again.  THAT is the difference between good breeders and poor breeders and in the end you're likely to save money by going with a good breeder, as well as working to support the continuation of a wonderful breed of dog.

I watched a documentary in college where they showed puppy dogs vs. puppy wolves that were living with humans for 6 weeks or something like that. They wanted to see if raising a wolf pup would result in the same thing as a dog. Results were- absolutely not.\n\nIn one specific scenario, the humans had three cups upside down on the floor with a treat under one of them. They would point to the cup that had the treat. Only the dog puppies knew and went directly to that cup. The wolf puppies did not understand and knocked everything over.\n\nAlso fun fact: another result of their evolution is that dogs are able to recognize human emotions just by seeing their faces. Dogs will scan the human face to decipher what our emotions are. They tested this by showing dogs a slideshow of photographs. Most were of people displaying different emotions through their faces; some were photos of other dogs. When a human face showed up, the dogs eyes darted immediately to the left side of the photo (right side of the human face apparently shows more emotion, according to this documentary) and then would look at the rest of it. When a dog face showed up, the dogs would not really react. Their eye movements had no discernible pattern when looking at photos of other dogs.\n\nTL;DR: Dogs have evolved over time, really scientifically making them man's best friend.\n\nEdit: [Link](https://vimeo.com/19472436) for those too lazy to search for it/scroll through the comments :)", "id": "d3n8id1"}, {"comment": "That's so interesting.

Adding too much can exhaust you while swimming, make it more difficult for you to get the right buoyancy (even with the BC), and because of the other two things, make you use more air. \n\n3. And I assume the things around the hoses are made of metal. Those aren't normal for a diver to usually have. I would assume they are designed to prevent a shark from biting the hoses that provide their regulators air. The hoses are rubber, so they would be susceptible to a shark bite.

If it's flexible enough to not be annoying, it's too thin to do anything against a shark's bite. I wonder if braided hoses would be a better option.

This is a rare case, could be at an aquarium for all we know. \n\nIn my experience (FWIW probably... 300-400 hours in the he water) most fish species want nothing to do with us. Most shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity.\n\n For example, the bottom of a surf board looks kinda like a seal from underwater. Its long and narrow and the two arms of the surfer form the \"flippers\" as he paddles out to a wave. Add in a tropical storm that kicks up the sea bottom for poor visibility, and it brings the big waves the surfers love and there you go. Recipe for a shark attack. Many sharks eat seals and sea lions. But even then, shark attacks are very rare.\n\nIMO, best advice is to do as they say on shark week...

Before her, bullies all had a death sentence. She is a former breeder/fighting dog. She rehabilitated very well, and has been an amazing dog throughout her new life years. \nThese are not her puppies! They were foster pups named Chip and Tater, they will be about 7 or 8 years old by now, and grew to be huge! (they think they may have had some great dane in them) Violet's owner would put the fosters in her backpack so they could all walk to work together (vet clinic)\n\nViolet is doing well in her old age now, but at 14 she's likely reaching the end of her doggy life. She is blind in one eye and has a brain tumor. You'd never know it though when she greets you with a wag of her tail and gives you the best bully crunchy face you've ever seen, gentle and wouldn't hurt a fly, and will give slobbery kisses if she gets the chance. She has my heart and always will. She's a true ambassador for the breed. It will be a true loss when she does pass to the rainbow bridge, she has been a gift to have in my life and those who have also known her. I'm so glad the internet has essentially immortalized her.

Pull the leash diagonally in front of you with your right hand, in the direction of left hip to right shoulder. Then grip the leash with the left hand where it falls next to your body naturally. Then take the rest of the leash that's in your right hand and make a loose loop and put the end back in your left hand. This gives you a very good grip on the leash and you are in complete control of how much slack your animal has. When the dog is not pulling you can loosen up and give him some more lead, but if he's pulling, the closer  he is to your own body, and shorter the lead (obviously long enough for him to walk with feet on the ground) the more control you have over the dog.

Saw the parents myself. Was legit timberwolf father and hybrid mother. The father scared the shit out of me.\n\nMost of the hybirds out there in the US are timberwolf hybrids, which are smaller and more docile than their grey wolf cousins. A lot people don't understand that when talking about wolf dogs. They're still a handful, but aren't nearly as bad/destructive as the grey wolfs.\n\nI come from a family of dog trainers and breeders, so I had a lot of experience before my wolf dog. Even still, I have had several couches, chairs, beds, carpet and other furniture eaten and destroyed by my wolf dog. I had to line my fence with sharp gravel to try to stop her from digging under it, but that only slowed it down. She snapped many steel cables when I had her on a runner line.\n\nThey need more training than any dog and room to run. It's really unfair to keep them confined in a kennel. They like to spend a lot of time outside. They also aren't affectionate and want to be left alone most of the time. They don't enjoy being petted very much. Frequently, mine will give me a 'fuck off' look and walk away after 20-30 seconds of attention, unless I have food and then I get the intense stare. Most of the time I don't let her watch me eat because of that.\n\nThe prey drive is insane. I've seen her jump and snatch low flying birds mid-air. She gets extremely manic when she goes after an animal. The excitement can last for hours after a kill. Moles, voles, squirrels, chipmunks, mice, rabbits, opossums and anything else foolish enough to enter my yard has found death in her jaws. \n\nOne time she chased a chipmunk and it ran up my gutters. My dog, undeterred, bit into and ripped the aluminum gutter off the side off my house. She pinched off both ends of the gutter and trapped the chipmunk inside. Then she chewed on the gutter for a while, dragging it around the yard like a toy. Gutter was a bit bloody because the metal cut her gums, but she still chewed on it. I had to put metal screens over my gutters to prevent that from happening again.\n\nI love my wolf dog, but when she dies I doubt I have the energy to train another one. I'd strongly recommend people don't buy them as pets, especially if they just want something that looks cool and don't have the time to train them."], [12, "[Bleheheh](http://imgur.com/pDq3sQQ)"], [9, "\"You got spunk kid....I like it\""], [8, "I want a spooky black dog."], [6, "I think once or twice when I saw this posted, someone knowledgeable said that this is just some breed of dog, based on its smaller size and the tongue lolling.

Rottweilers, German Shepards, and even a Kangal. Including my two pet pigs, pinky and piglet, I was experienced with raising and training dogs. Fast forward 15 years later and I got Teemu from a friend who was going to surrender her. Now Teemu isn't even a full wolf. She is a wolf hybrid. At about a year she already outgrew and my other dog Parros. At a year and a half she began to attack and kill everything. She is ok with people for the most part. But any other animal whether it's another dog or birds or whatever comes into my yard unsuspecting gets killed. She is incredibly strong so it is hard to walk her especially when she sights something you can't see that's a hundred yards away and decides she has to kill it immediately.

She's 13 years old now and has cancer, but it's been a fun ride. Mine was given to me by the breeder for free. Saw the parents myself. Was legit timberwolf father and hybrid mother. The father scared the shit out of me.\n\nMost of the hybirds out there in the US are timberwolf hybrids, which are smaller and more docile than their grey wolf cousins. A lot people don't understand that when talking about wolf dogs. They're still a handful, but aren't nearly as bad/destructive as the grey wolfs.\n\nI come from a family of dog trainers and breeders, so I had a lot of experience before my wolf dog. Even still, I have had several couches, chairs, beds, carpet and other furniture eaten and destroyed by my wolf dog. I had to line my fence with sharp gravel to try to stop her from digging under it, but that only slowed it down. She snapped many steel cables when I had her on a runner line.\n\nThey need more training than any dog and room to run. It's really unfair to keep them confined in a kennel. They like to spend a lot of time outside. They also aren't affectionate and want to be left alone most of the time. They don't enjoy being petted very much. Frequently, mine will give me a 'fuck off' look and walk away after 20-30 seconds of attention, unless I have food and then I get the intense stare. Most of the time I don't let her watch me eat because of that.\n\nThe prey drive is insane. I've seen her jump and snatch low flying birds mid-air. She gets extremely manic when she goes after an animal. The excitement can last for hours after a kill. Moles, voles, squirrels, chipmunks, mice, rabbits, opossums and anything else foolish enough to enter my yard has found death in her jaws. \n\nOne time she chased a chipmunk and it ran up my gutters. My dog, undeterred, bit into and ripped the aluminum gutter off the side off my house. She pinched off both ends of the gutter and trapped the chipmunk inside. Then she chewed on the gutter for a while, dragging it around the yard like a toy. Gutter was a bit bloody because the metal cut her gums, but she still chewed on it. I had to put metal screens over my gutters to prevent that from happening again.\n\nI love my wolf dog, but when she dies I doubt I have the energy to train another one.

Same for Toucans?", "id": "cznmlxi"}, {"comment": "http://adventuresintoucanland.com/2012/04/so-you-think-you-want-a-toucan/   \n   \n**Caring for a toucan takes up a lot of your time everyday (yes, even Saturdays\u2026)**\n\nToucans have daily needs that cannot be put off regardless of your schedule, your health, your mood, or the weather. They need a fresh bowl of fruit provided two times per day \u2013 a variety of fruits which must be chopped for them each morning. Toucans are also messy (see below) and need to be cleaned up after daily to maintain good hygiene. Toucans are very social birds who do not like to spend long stretches of time without interaction. I spend an average of 3-4 hours each day directly caring for Paco, Paz, & Pepe, sometimes more, depending on the day and situation. While I do have Three-Cans instead of one, it is important to understand that even one will require hours of your time each and every day. If you are someone who has a full-time job and is away from home 8+ hours per day, you will need assistance in caring for your toucan for the times you are away.\n\n\n\n**Toucans are expensive**\n\nMost often, when I say toucans are expensive, people think I am referring to the initial costs of purchasing one and that is certainly true. For example, if you\u2019re looking for a Toco toucan baby akin to Paco, Paz, and Pepe, expect an estimated $10,000 investment. But the toucan costs I am referring to here are more about the ongoing expenses of having a toucan.\n\nToucans need a constant supply of fresh fruit and cheaper cheats such as canned or frozen will not cut it. They tend to prefer the higher-priced, more exotic produce such as papaya, mango, and fresh berries. Toucans also need specially formulated, low-iron pellets which you may need to ship in, as they are not readily available everywhere. Toucans must also be provided with a variety of toys for mental stimulation and enrichment \u2013 this is NOT an option. Our last Drs Foster & Smith toy order we purchased for the Three-Cans was well over $400. Those toys should last us a couple of months before they are either destroyed or no longer interesting (toucans are smart, get bored easily, and will not be interested in a toy for long). Sure, you can try to be a bit more economical in making some of your own toys \u2013 which we do \u2013 but you will need supplies and thinking you can make toucans \u201cbudget-friendly\u201d is an illusion.\n\n\n\n**Toucans need a lot of space**\n\nWhether you plan to house your toucan indoors or out, it will require a much larger enclosure than one designed for a comparably-sized parrot. Toucans are very high-energy birds who spend most of their day bouncing around. They need lots of perches and room to expend their energy. If you plan to allow your toucan out in your home, be prepared for it to demand full run of the house. A toucan will not sit on a foraging tree like a parrot and work at toy for any extended period of time. It will most likely not even sit in one spot for more than 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n**Toucans are messy**\n\nGuess what? Toucans poop. A lot. They have an extremely fast metabolism and eat about every 15 minutes, which means they poop at roughly the same frequency. They also fling their fruit in the air when they eat \u2013 some of it makes it into their mouth, some of it doesn\u2019t. My Three-Cans live in outdoor aviaries, so it\u2019s relatively easy to hose their cages clean everyday. But what I know from speaking with others whose toucans reside indoors is that cleaning up poop and fruit goop is a constant battle. No matter where your toucan lives, be prepared to spend time cleaning up after them everyday. And remember \u2013 what goes in, comes out and their favorites \u2013 blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries \u2013 have staining power on the clothing and furniture you hold most dear.\n\n\n\n**Toucans are tough to train**\n\nToucans are much more hyper than parrots, and therefore, more difficult to hold their attention for training. Take it from me \u2013 I have a lot of patience and interest in the principles of animal training and it takes me much longer than I would have expected to get the results I am striving for. Toucans are very intelligent and have the capacity to learn, it\u2019s their limited attention span that slows your progress.\n\n**Toucans are not a domesticated animal and will not behave as such**\n\nDogs and cats have been domesticated for centuries and have been specifically bred to enhance their behavioral characteristics to make them more suitable as human companions. Toucans still possess a very wild spirit, often only a generation or two separation from their native counterparts. Some of their behavior will mystify you, some of it will baffle you, some of it may downright annoy you. Toucans, like all birds, spend springtime ensconced in hormonal, mating behaviors that are much more difficult to manage than say, a dog whining in the kitchen. There is no manual on toucan behavior. Prepare to approach each day with a scientific curiosity and patience, knowing that your toucan was not designed to live in your world.\n\n\n\n**Few people will be willing/able to care for your toucan in your absence**\n\nAs I have already repeatedly mentioned, toucans require a lot of time and patience to care for on a daily basis. Not many people have what it takes to take on a toucan, even if it\u2019s only for a week. Be prepared that the great majority of people you might hope to pet sit your toucan will either be too intimidated, not interested, not available, or otherwise unreliable. It takes a special niche of person capable of taking on the full responsibility of your toucan\u2019s care in your absence, which is definitely not as simple as coming in to give fresh kibble once a day. Be prepared that it will be extremely difficult to find someone up for the job and available when you need them. If you travel a lot or take extended holidays away from home, a toucan is probably not for you.\n\n\n\n**Most/many of your friends will not understand**\n\nI have very few \u201canimal people\u201d as friends. They still have their many positive qualities, but wanting to run their own personal zoo as I do is not one of them. Toucans are not like having a dog, yet all of your friends will compare your experience to that, as that is all many of them have experienced firsthand. Because a toucan is not a dog, the care and time you spend with your toucan may seem \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201cobsessive\u201d to others. Your friends will not understand why you have to be home at highly-specific times to care for your toucan, nor will they understand why you are devoting so much of your life to a bird. Be prepared to get kick-back when you have to bow out of activities and spontaneous weekend getaways because you have to take care of your toucan. If the thought of losing most of your spontaneity and missing out on extended happy hours with your closest pals because you have to spend time with your bird bums you out, then a toucan is probably not for you. Your toucan\u2019s needs must be made a priority and often times, that requires sacrifices on your part that most others cannot relate to.\n\n\n\n**You will feel guilty most of the time**\n\nPerhaps this is just a \u201cme\u201d thing, but I feel guilty on a pretty consistent basis about the life my toucans lead. Sure, they\u2019re adult birds that we adopted and we\u2019re working hard to provide a much better life for them than they have ever received in the past, but\u2026it never seems to feel good enough. I consistently wish I could provide them with more freedom, more space, more attention, more toys, more interesting activities\u2026the list will always go on. The upside is that this feeling is a constant motivator to keep trying harder to make things \u201cmore perfect\u201d but the downside is that they still have such a wild spirit and will never be able to live the life they were made for \u2013 flying free in their natural habitat. If you\u2019re like me, looking at your bird in captivity will always make you feel conflicted and guilty and this is just a feeling you will have to learn to live with.", "id": "cznufqs"}, {"comment": "TL;DR: Don't get a toucan.

They were feral and showed no interest in being inside. We lived in rural Georgia, where the winters are short and fairly mild. But, one year an ice storm hit.\n\nMy dad put kerosene heaters in the garage and cracked the door. We were slightly concerned about the heaters being unsupervised all night. My son was about 10-years-old and his cousin was about 12 at the time. The three of us filled the pick-up bed with blankets and stayed there all night, whispering stories, playing games, and snacking. \n\nSome time during the night, I was woken by a noise. I shined the flashlight around and not only were five or six barn cats curled up in there, but a family of raccoons. By daybreak, a small fox (!!!!), and a random mutt had joined us. All was peaceful. Like there was an unspoken \"survival truce\" among them. \n\nAt dawn, they were all gone, except for the dog. So, that's how we ended up with Tiger, the world's ugliest mutt. He had these white mole-like lumps all over him, and mange, which we managed to get somewhat under control. Except that the hair on his butt never grew back. So he had this wiry sheep-like sepia coat \u2014 like a dirty-yellow afro all over \u2014 with two big pink bald patches on his ass. Tiger was a sight. (and a smell) \n\nOver the years, somehow Tiger always knew it was bath time before I even turned on the hose. I'd come out of the house with a rag and a bucket just in time to catch a glimpse of those pink cheeks off in the distance, bounding over the hillside.\n\nWhen I was a teen, I thought living in the country sucked so bad. LOL Looking back as an adult, I think kids who don't have a chance to experience county living, at least for a time, are missing out a little. \n\nSide note: I am normally very against inviting wild animals up close.

It was one of those who found her and brought her back, she absolutely bolted to me when she saw me. She put some serious panic into me that day.\n\nWe all assumed she must have been looking for me, like I said I have had her for almost 11 years and she has never done anything close to running away be it from home or when let off her lead on a walk, regardless of where it is, be it near home or miles away in a place she has never been before.

The cat he hand fed from two weeks is not the same. It's harder to get him excited and he spends more time sleeping than he used to. I had to start giving him wet food to make him eat enough. For months he would randomly catch a scent and start searching around and he likes to sleep in the closet with my boyfriend's things. It makes me sad because I feel like I can't give enough love to all my cats to make up for losing him. They're happy enough now, I just wish I could explain that he didn't choose to go away.\n\nOne of the worst things was that he would spend long periods at the hospital so they seemed to expect him to come back for a long time and be disappointed when I would come home alone and I didn't smell like him anymore.\n\nI posted some pictures over on /r/aww, titled \"A man and his cat\" in case anyone is interested in seeing my boyfriend with his kitty.\n\n~~\n\nEdit: You guys are too nice! I forget sometimes how many people will read something so personal.\n\nSince people are reading this, those of you that are single owners of pets, I highly recommend making a list of where to find the pet records, the vet number, any special needs your pet might have, *especially* if the pet requires a special diet or regular medication. You don't want someone to run out and grab a bag of food because you're out that might be fine for a normal cat, but doesn't fit health needs of your particular cat. \n\nFor instance one of my cats can get struvite crystals in his urine and has a tiny urinary tract, so he MUST remain on a low phosphorus diet or he can get blocked up quickly. One gets very constipated and has to have laxatone in his nightly wet food. And on and on, I have five cats with different dietary needs. If you have pets you know how it is. They even have a favorite toy or a blanket they have to sleep with or other quirks. It's worth the time and something I worry about now that I have sole responsibility for five lives. \n\nSomeone also suggested to me a sign on the front door if you have pets, so rescue workers know to watch out for, or save them if possible. The EMTs, officers were in and out and it occurred to me later one of my cats could have darted out in fear.", "id": "d1x2sgz"}, {"comment": "\ud83d\ude22 poor kitties.

Us too and while there is no one answer, there are several theories as to why this is. Best of Orlando did a little research and here out our top three favorite Goofy/Pluto theories: \n\nThere is a scene in 80s film, \u201cStand By Me\u201d where the boys begin to discuss the theory of Pluto and Goofy. Will Wheaton\u2019s character asks, \u201cMickey\u2019s a mouse, Donald\u2019s a duck, Pluto\u2019s a dog. What\u2019s Goofy?\u201d The question implies that because Goofy can walk and talk he may or not be a dog. True Disney fans agree that Goofy is a dog but that still doesn\u2019t explain why he has advantages over Pluto. Before we can delve into the theories we must first take a quick history lesson into both characters past.\n\nHistory:\nGoofy makes his first screen appearance in Mickey\u2019s Revue (1932), but he was an anonymous character. Over the next two years his name changes to Dippy Dawg, Dippy the Goof, and Mr. Geef before finally becoming Goofy in Orphan\u2019s Benefit (1934).\n\nMeanwhile, Pluto first appears in Walt Disney\u2019s short The Chain Gang (1930) but has no name. In 1930 in The Picnic the dog is named Rover. In The Moose Hunt (1931) his name is called Pluto the Pup. This last name change to Pluto the pup makes it pretty obvious that Pluto is in fact a dog. So if we can agree they are both dogs, the question still begs, why are they so different?\n\nTheory #1: Evolution \u2013 Some say that Goofy has evolved from a dog, while Pluto has failed to for whatever reason. Perhaps Pluto\u2019s time as a dog is due to the fact that he has an owner (Mickey) and has been unable to evolve while Goofy may have never had an owner. \n\nTheory #2: Disney animators rule \u2013 When Disney animators create anything they are the ruler of that thing. Theory #2 suggests that they wanted to showcase their power with the creation of one talking, walking dog and one that was just a pet. The creation of Goofy forced every Disney fan to question the natural law of things. \n\nTheory #3: The Smart one and the Dumb one \u2013 Another interesting notion is that Goofy because he walk on two legs is the clumsy foolish character, and Pluto is the smart dog that walks on all fours like he\u2019s supposed be doing.\n\nTheory #4: Goofy isn\u2019t an animal at all \u2013 As was the opinion of Carl Barks and the main characters in his stories, some of these characters just look like animals but are actually human in their behavior. They represent humanity. This could be true of Goofy, being a dawg, which is an anthropomorphized version of a dog, while Pluto remains the real dog.  \nStolen from website***", "id": "d0ekvfd"}, {"comment": "I like to think that Goofy is originally from the Disney universe where animals are intelligent, and Pluto is from our universe where dogs are just dogs and somehow he crossed into the Disneyverse.", "id": "d0elgxv"}, {"comment": "That's the most comforting one too.

You agree, because by this time you're really enjoying the genetically perfect dog they've given you and you like the organization.

There was a major flooding issue due to severe weather. The opening to access the trapped puppies appears to be too small for any of the humans to attempt a rescue, so the distressed mama sprang into action.\nHer efforts and those of the soldiers around her resulted in the rescue of seven puppies. Unfortunately, five did not survive.\nThe shelter\u2019s post mentions that the surviving dogs are recovering and waiting for possible adoptions."], [120, "This exact situation happened a some years ago where I work, but with a cat.  Our offices were small and sat on blocks, so the feral cats would take shelter underneath in the dirt.  One cat had her kittens under there when we experienced a heavy downfall.  The area around our offices were quickly inundated with water (poor drainage).  The mama cat was meowing loudly and pacing back and forth by the area she would normally enter her shelter.  This spot was completely underwater.  We realized her kittens were still under the office and tried to help.  Our guys dug a hole on the opposite end of the building to create another entrance.  Once it was big enough she crawled in and came back out with one kitten.  \n\nUnfortunately, that one was the only surviving kitten, the rest didn't make it.  Once it was dry again we sealed up the edges so no more animals could get trapped underneath the offices again.  \n\nEdit: Just remembered a second situation.  A stray cat gave birth outside my parents' house one summer.  She was friendly so they fed her and gave her water.  This cat had placed her kittens inside a street drain.  Of course, it began to rain and water began pouring in.  Mama cat ran up to my mom and meowed at her and ran back in to the drain.  My mom followed and saw the cat with a kitten in her mouth.  My mom took the first kitten, mama cat handed her the second kitten, and then jumped out.  And that's how my parents ended up with a cat.

Guard cats are outside cats and either males who were neutered after they reached sexual maturity - so they are still aggressive - or females who were spayed only after having a litter. In both cases the cats retain a sense of family and territory.\n\nI didn't believe him until we had a guard cat adopt us. An old tom, who moved onto our porch and wouldn't leave. We got him neutered and provided him food and water but, other than the regular gift of giant dead rat on the doorstep that would send my wife screaming back into the house until I tossed it over the fence, he rarely interacted with us.\n\nOne day though a young pit mix showed up in our yard. Friendly pup, but big and obviously untrained. First he was just letting me pet him. I had the wife take the kids inside just in case (never trust a strange dog regardless of breed) and told her to call animal control. That was when the dog spotted our old tom and went after him.\n\nThe last I saw was a blur of fur, barking, and cat screams going behind my garage. Like an idiot I rushed back there and grabbed the dog and pulled him off the cat - not even considering the thing could turn on me. He did, snapping at me but missing. The cat, however, took that moment to launch a fierce counterattack.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the cat had a broken tooth and a broken claw. The dog's face was tore open, one of his jowls completely split in two and one of his eyes was scratched. His neck had multiple bleeding wounds and he just lay in my driveway panting while I treated his injuries until animal control showed up.\n\nFortunately, I was able to convince animal control to not destroy the pup and he was eventually adopted out.\n\nBut that was the day I learned to believe in the guard cat.

Therefore with Capybaras (assuming the same rate of domestication) it will take 125 years.\n\nAnd that's assuming the same rate of domestication!
