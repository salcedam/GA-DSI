You have a large variety of different styles of blocks at your disposal, and the worlds are automatically generated for you to put your creations in.

You're given the ability to make tools, gather seeds, farm wheat, farm animals, quarry stone, collect wood, and everything else you need to build. If you're more interested in building up an incredible base full of all the resources you'll ever need and more from absolutely **nothing**, then this is the game for you.\n\nBut there's more to it than that. Minecraft gives you great ability to make contraptions. Redstone is Turing complete, so with a little knowhow, you can make a door that opens when you put in the right combination. With a lot of knowhow, you can create calculators and computers and other incredible things, Electronics not your thing? The water physics in the game isn't realistic by any means, but the way water works means you can create all sorts of cool things with it. You can make automatically moving paths to move your cows where you want them to go. You can make water elevators to get your cows to your above ground base. You can make a farm where flowing water automatically collects your wheat for food. Do you like tinkering with things? Then this is the game for you.\n\nThere's a certain, indescribable freedom that the game gives you. When you play you don't feel like you're simply doing the things that the developers want you to do. You feel like your creations are unparalleled, that you can create things that the developers could never imagine.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, I can see how Minecraft can look simple and not worth your time.

It is from that hidden home that legions are dispatched across all realms and the multiverse to continue the endless expansion of the square worlds.

Though they possessed the wealth of the world they were not satisfied. They wanted more.\n> An ancient prophecy spoke of a great power buried beneath the earth. A power so great that the gods themselves built a prison to keep it contained. What could be so powerful as to strike fear into the gods, the philosophers pondered, what does a god need fear?\n> The priests warned that it was an evil power, dark and corrupting. But still the minds of men wandered. They had learned to harness the power of water to grow their crops. They had learned to harness the power of fire to forge their tools. They had learned to harness the power of the earth to build their temples. Perhaps they could harness this power too.\n> Such thoughts were folly, the priests warned. They must not seek what is buried, or incur the wrath of the gods. But the greed of men was too strong, and their faith too weak. One day a great king declared, \"We will dig.\" And they dug.\n> Miles and miles of tunnels they dug, with pickaxes of iron and diamond, hauling away carts and carts of stone, ignoring the metals and gems, in search of the power that lay hidden. But in their fervor they neglected the world above. The temples fell into disarray, fields were left unplanted, and women and children starved. Some spoke of dark things that came in the night. It was a curse from the gods, the priests declared. But still they dug deeper.\n> Blinded by their greed they kept digging. Even as civilization above them fell to hunger and war. If only they could find what was buried, then all would be restored. For years they searched to no avail. Deep in the tunnels men were slowly driven mad by the constant pick of their pickaxes on stone. They would wake up to find men missing, and some would swear they could hear laughter echoing from somewhere deep within the mines.\n> Then one day it happened. Their picks broke through stone into a hallway made of brick. This was it. The searched through the libraries and store rooms and then they found what they were looking for. The portal.\n> They stood in awe for a moment, the shifting black substance seemed to glow in front of them. Then one stepped forward and peered deep into the depths. And stepped in. One by one the others followed.\n> As each one stepped through he could feel himself transforming. A strange energy coursed through their veins. Could this be the power that they spoke of? With this strange energy their bodies began to transform. Their limbs grew longer, their muscles stronger. Their skin became shrouded in a thick black mist, and from their eyes came a purple glow...\n\n[Permalink here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/25psr6/diamonds_can_be_found_in_the_walls_of_abandoned/chjub98)", "id": "czpbib6"}], [{"comment": "The enderman in the background of the thread is suddenly really creepy", "id": "czowbme"}, {"comment": "What enderman?  \noh.  \nGuys?  \nIt's looking at me!  \nGuys, help!  \nHeeeelp!", "id": "czp2o4s"}, {"comment": "*vvwwwoooohp*\n\n*paahhhh*", "id": "czpgmrh"}], [{"comment": "Go, fanfic writers!!!

Time for some number crunching!**\n\nLet's choose Australia to do our estimate because i am Australian.(http://i.imgur.com/AmeN3tS.png) Voxelmap has a grid system which splits the map into squares. Each square represents 16x16 blocks in the game. Each red square represents 16x16 of those 16x16 squares (which we call chunks). If we open this image up in paint.net, you can see that it is 1920x1080 pixels. If we then measure the chunks, we find that each chunk is 10x10 pixels. Therefore, 1 pixel = 1.6 blocks. From here, we can measure the longest distance of 2 points in Australia which is from Cape Byron in NSW to Steep Point in WA. If we draw a line between those 2 points, we get a distance of around about 1434 pixels, give or take 15. That distance in real life (measured using Google Earth) is 3993km give or take 15. Therefore, our ratio of pixels to kilometres is 1434:3993. **Therefore our ratio of kilometres to blocks is** 3993:2294 which could be rounded (for estimation purposes) to **40:23**. The Earth's circumference is 40,075km long **which puts this ingame Earth's circumference at approximately 23,000 blocks long.**\n\nEDIT: As /u/genandic has pointed out, my math is in fact correct. **The map from East to West is around 22k-23k long.**", "id": "d5vcpqk"}, {"comment": "It's a good thing the estimate was a wild guess then, yes?\n", "id": "d5vddif"}, {"comment": "That is true.

The mines seem like they might be 5% of the way there, in terms of sheer development time. Might just be impractical, from a development standpoint, but visualize the vast amounts of uniqueness and variations you could achieve, given that technology could lend itself practically. I guess you'd start with a few basic plans, like say medieval castle, or ancient temple, each defined by various elements, e.g. turrets, towers, chapel, gangway, altar, catacombs, etc. I'm not giving specific examples and obviously it's open to creative interpretation. A uniquely generated and complex structure like a massive and ornamental castle, or OP's design, would require a lot more development than something like the mines or villages in their current state, but it all seems achievable given the effort is made, albeit I don't game much and I don't know of any examples, but I'd love to hear some, if anyone knows of any.

The only thing that changed was shrinking their hitbox so that they can't interact across parallel tracks.\n\nMore information:\n\nThis glitch worked due to a deliberate pysics tweak to allow minecarts to be pushed by the player.  Since the engine has no concept of mass, it can't calculate the results of an elastic collision, so normally two colliding entities just limply displace one another.  So in minecarts, there is an extra bit of code that says \"if the colliding entity is a player or another minecart, add their velocity to yours but don't push back\".  If two minecarts came in contact with each other on parallel tracks, they would both be considered the \"pusher\" and accelerate one another.\n\nSince the push is shared, but one had higher initial velocity, one might expect it to slowly drift away from the other, but minecarts also have a speed cap of ~8m/s, which keeps them locked together, even as the internal \"velocity\" counter starts climbing to ridiculously high values.  The easiest way to do a boost was to dip one cart down to collide with a second waiting cart (if you hit it from the corner the contact isn't great).  Alternatively you could set up a loop of always active in-place boosters.  Originally it was done on a 2x2 loop and the two boosters would instantly transfer their velocity to any minecart grazing the booster loop, but because the internal velocity counter just kept growing on the boosted carts, after a relatively short time it would hit an integer overflow which would cause the booster carts to either reverse direction or fly off the track.\n\nThis eventually got resolved by adding a interruption mechanism, in which both booster carts hit a wall on one side of the loop and come to a complete halt, but one of the two carts sat on an incline, so that boost starts again from scratch once it slides back down.  You could then tie the loop to a redstone switch to summon the booster cart to power a subway system.  Extra minecarts were stored in a vertical stack called a \"pez dispenser\" which would get dragged off from the bottom of the stack by the booster cart.  Pretty sure pez dispensers remained popular until carts became storable in redstone dispensers.\n\nA few weeks prior to it being patched out of the game, an instant booster was discovered by keeping the boosted pair in contact for the entire length of track, but pinning the inclined one against the wall with a door.

There's often 3-5 different models for something large like a mountain. This allows you to show the low poly/resolution models at a distance where you'd expect to lose the fine details. That's how a good number of games can deliver worlds with incredible render distances.\n\nBut minecraft, being just voxels (no models), this isn't an option.

When charcoal burns it releases a ton of monoxide, but can't actually melt iron. Burn charcoal and iron ore in a big chimney looking thing called a bloomery. As oxygen gets removed from the ore, it binds together into a giant oxygen-less mass called a bloom. Heat the bloom up and pound it to squeeze the slag out, which melts at a lower temperature. Boom now you have wrought iron.\n\nBlast furnace time. Coal can make monoxide, but not as much. Burn coal and iron ore together in an even bigger chimney thing made of bricks, called a Blast Furnace. Pump as much air through it as you can. The iron actually gets hot enough to melt now. All the slag is melted out and the monoxide removes the oxygen. Cast the liquid iron and now you have pig iron.

I see you've been downvoted and I think that really sucks :( \n\nThe reason you have two answers for x in this instance is because of the x^2.\n\nWhen you multiply out the given numbers, the result is x^2 +3x+2x+6 and its equal to x. \n\nCombining the like terms gives us x^2 +5x+6=x\n\nThe x^2 provides us with two answers because the square root of a number is a number that when multiplied by itself yields the number under the root. \n\nEg ( sqrt is notation for the radical symbol, I'm mobile can't can't use that character) \n\nSqrt(x^2 ) = x because x*x=x^2 \n\nOr to use a numerical example \n\nSqrt(9) = 3 because 3*3=9.\n\n.....but hold on! A positive number multiplied by another positive number yields a positive number, but the product of two negatives is positive too! \n\nThat means that sqrt(9) isn't just 3, it's also -3 because -3*-3=9 \n\nSo if your x^2 were 9, your x could be both 3 and -3. Sometimes you'll only be interested in one of the values, but that's a matter of application. \n\nIn the numbers used above, things get a bit trickier. Equations that have x^2 in them are called quadratic, and for this well need to use the quadratic formula. \n\nWithout going into the formula all at once (someone else linked it), I am going to walk through it kind of out of order. \n\nthere is a square root with a calculation under it in the formula: sqrt(b^2 -4ac)\n\nBut for this formula to work, the right hand side of the equal sign must be 0. So we subtract out the x from the right hand side and the left hand side, giving us x^2 +4x+6=0 \n\nThis follows the form ax^2 +bx+c=0 which is the general form of the quadratic equation. In this, a b and c are constants (numbers) and x is an unknown variable. For us, a=1 (because we have 1x^2 ) b=4 and c=6\n\nFor certain values of a and b, it's possible to wind up with a negative value underneath the radical when we calculate sqrt(b^2 -4ac). In this case we wind up with sqrt(16-24) which is sqrt(-8)\n\nThis is a problem because there doesn't exist any number that when multiplied by itself (squared), yields a negative number. \n\nThis is where the imaginary number i comes into play. You didn't specify being confused by this but I thought I'd explain anyway. i is an \"imaginary number\" and its equal to sqrt(-1)\n\nWhat it lets us do is \"pull out\" the negative by multiplying it by i. Numbers under square roots can be factored or multiplied: \n\nEg sqrt(15) = sqrt(3)*sqrt(5)\n\nThis principal applies to i and a negative square root by treating i as a positive variable. \n\nThus sqrt(-8)=sqrt(-1) * sqrt(8) = i*sqrt(8)\n\nIn the context of this problem, our i*sqrt(8) is divided by 2 (the right hand side of the quadratic formula is \"all over 2a.\" 2a=2(1)=2)as a part of the quadratic formula, the principle above applies and we can factor this as \n\nSqrt(8)=sqrt(4)*sqrt(2)\n\nSqrt(4) is +- 2 but we choose the positive 2 because we are multiplying against a positive sqrt(2) and want a positive result \n\nSo sqrt(8)=2 * sqrt(2). Great! We're dividing by 2 which leaves us with just our sqrt(2)*i\n\nGreat, now we have x=-b/2a +- i*sqrt(2) \n\nWell -b/2a is -4/2(1) which is -2 \n\nSo we have -2+-i*sqrt(2)\n\nRecall that the +- comes from the sqrt(2) because that still has both a positive and negative result. This is what brings us to our final results, since we have a +- we have two mathematically valid values for x and they are \n\nx=-2+i*sqrt(2)\n\nAnd \n\nx=-2-i*sqrt(2)\n\nPhew!

I say this primarily because he was famous/infamous for updating his mods often within hours of a new version of Minecraft coming out and there was in turn a huge race among the API developers to similarly try to keep up with Risugami.  That included Forge, who for awhile also tried to be compatible with ModLoader... until they no longer cared.  Risu also dropped out about the same time Dinnerbone and the other modders moved to Mojang too.  As a side note, Risugami made his mods *without* MCP and used obfuscated code directly.  Then again, he was one of the early contributors to MCP and helped identify most of base structures that modders have been using since.\n\nThe official API groundwork was started... but that just sort of died and never went anywhere.  Now that Microsoft owns the shop, I highly doubt it will ever be done too.  Notch had good intentions and I think his heart was in the right place (particularly hiring the modders that made his game really good in the first place) but it backfired so far as it pulled a bunch of the best and brightest from the modding scene and pissed off those who didn't get hired.\n\nModding now is broken, I believe, due to social issues in the modding community rather than due to any changes actually done in the code itself by Mojang.", "id": "d7ylup9"}, {"comment": "Yup.

For every rose she received in the chest she'd donate 1\u00a2 to the charity. \n\nKid was like 10, 11 years old and spent all of her pocket money donating to this charity because, in her words, she didn't \"want other kids to have to grow up with the condition\" and having to come to terms with knowing they'd die younger because of it. \n\nDecided to match all of her donations for as long as I could afford to.

On my newer laptop with the Haswell Intel Iris graphics, there's almost no difference.\n\nYou can download the ISO file, and write it to a thumbdrive using [Unetbootin](http://unetbootin.github.io/) and make sure to set the setting labeled \"(ubuntu only)\" to the size of your thumbdrive in MB. If it works better, you can also use that thumbdrive to install it over or along side Windows.\n\nWhether it will run better or not, has to do with how mature Intel's open source drivers are for that IGP. My old laptop was pushing 7, so that graphics card driver was very mature and a lot more recently updated than the Windows driver. My new laptop's IGP is still pretty new, and so is both the Windows and open source driver. Even if this advice is useless now, in a couple years when HP stops supporting that laptop with newer drivers, Linux's driver will still get occasional updates to keep those blocks busting along.\n\nI feel uneasy about saying this, but we both know that in a couple of years it will need replaced anyway. Kids are hard on electronics, even when they are careful with them. Hell, adults are hard on electronics and we should know better. So I'm going to go ahead and give this advice.\n\nNext time, build your kid a desktop. There are a lot of wonderful guides like [Logical Increments](http://www.logicalincrements.com/#!/) and [PC part picker](http://pcpartpicker.com/), subreddits like /r/buildapc, and Youtube channels like [Linus tech tips](https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips) and [Jayztwocents](https://www.youtube.com/user/Jayztwocents).\n\nBuilding a PC isn't too hard, and building a desktop means that you can buy upgrade parts as birthday/christmas presents (letting you upgrade the system incrementally so the cost is spread out over months and years instead of all at once like the laptop).\n\nFor example (in this example we are going 2 years into the past so I can use current parts): Christmas 2015 this laptop isn't cutting it anymore, your son wants to play some more advanced games and wear and tear have take it's toll, the hard drive is failing. You go on logical increments and see what's available, you choose the \"entry\" category, grab a display model screen from Best buy (when those are available.. they are sooo cheap compared to in-box ~$70) and a keyboard and mouse set from Big Lots for $10. You watch some Linus Tech Tips to learn how this thing should go together (as well as what not to do) have the parts delivered to where you work (given that it's okay with your superiors), paint the case and display borders if you want and get it up and running.\n\nHis birthday 2016 rolls around. He's happy with his computer, but some of the games he saved up and bought need more horsepower. Let's say your willing to spend ~$200, [Bingo](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127845&ignorebbr=1) and his games run an order of magnitude faster.\n\nYou can keep going, buying some more ram and a steam card, a better processor that fits in the same socket (although eventually you will need to replace the motherboard, ram, and processor at once. Sockets change and DDR4 memory will soon be the standard.) \n\nChoose a case with filters, I had no idea how much dirt was getting into my system. Dirt makes things hotter and slows down the PC, and lowers it's life.\n\nAs much care as you put into making that laptop look so amazing, I believe in you.

The question doesn't have an answer, because it is really a derivative from dozens of variables and sub-questions, smaller problems to solve that give you a final solution.\n\nYou ask if this wall should use brick or cobble, but under the hood the real questions are what style you're looking to produce, what the rest of your building looks, or will look like, what complexity works, what _patterns_ you can use to achieve that.\n\nThen you compare to things you know, see if you can use or adjust that for your own needs, or if it's realistic to come up with something different.\n\nPlus trial and error. Lots of trial and error. Which is what it has in common with all the things you listed. You keep failing, until you don't.

They can hold/wear items that will still remain visible when the armor stand becomes invisible. When you see people making complex sculptures in vanilla, or something crazy [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96OCQmwIs4w) from the glorious /u/onnowhere, it's actually armor stands wearing blocks and items on their heads/holding them in their hands. In this case, the towers and balloons are custom models, presumably also being worn by armor stands. The thing that makes them truly unique is they are entirely poseable - you can control the angle of their limbs/head very specifically to position stuff exactly as you want it. These angles can also be changed freely with commands (/entitydata).\n2. They have tags specifically made to make them convenient for mapmakers. Some examples are Invisible (which makes them permanently invisible without the possibility of particles or the effect running out like with potions), NoGravity (self-explanatory), DisabledSlots (which lets you really specifically control the interactions players can have with each individual slot of the armor stand), Marker (which, as the name suggests, makes them act as a \"marker\" - their body doesn't render and they have no hitbox, and can't be interacted with) etc. These tags can be changed on the fly with commands.\n3. They're entities, meaning they can be targeted by commands like /execute and such. This may seem obvious, but people that aren't experienced in commands and/or Minecraft mechanics often mistake armor stands for blocks, which they are not.\n4. They have no AI by default, meaning you don't need to take extra precautions to keep them from moving, damaging players, etc.\n\nA lot of these behaviors can be replicated with other mobs using other methods (invisibility potion effect, NoAI to make the mob not move or have gravity).

In that case, spawners, barriers, farmland, smooth double slabs, various mushroom blocks, water and flowing water/lava blocks (not a water/lava bucket items), piston heads, lit redstone ore, and **many** other varieties of blocks unattainable without commands are also mods.\n\n[Here's](http://pastebin.com/pCu2YXxb) a list of **vanilla** IDs for blocks and items (for 1.9); anywhere that `inventory` is false is where something cannot be obtained within the inventory period, not counting blocks that are simply missing from the creative inventory (51 occurrences). If they're not available in the creative inventory, then are they mods? If not, then what separates command blocks from them?\n\nBut as many have stated prior, commands themselves are not mods. They are built-in functions of the game, which is what vanilla means: default, out-of-the-box, what it comes with, nothing third-party. And just to mention, you also don't need commands if a command block was already placed because the pick-block *creative* function provides you with a command block.\n\nDid you install a third-party mod to activate commands or did you set \"Allow Cheats\" to \"On\" in the vanilla game's world creation screen? Did you install a third-party mod to run a command in the chat or did you just type a command in the vanilla game's chat? Does a vanilla server admin install mods to OP players or do they run the built-in `/op` command that comes with the vanilla game? Does a vanilla server install mods to activate command blocks or do they change the vanilla setting `enable-command-block` in the `server.properties` file?\n\nIn that case, are all servers that use server-management commands that come with the vanilla game through the console considered modded, and thus invalidates all bug reports concerning servers (as the bug tracker does not accept modded content)? For that matter, all bug reports that involve commands in any way are invalid if they're to be considered mods. The game would be a lot different (likely in a bad way) if servers and commands were unsupported due to being mods and were not allowed to have bugs fixed for them.\n\nMojang has a simple reason for withholding command blocks from the creative inventory: to prevent those who do not know how to use commands from accessing them. The gateway to using them *is* commands, which is perfectly reasonable. This is because commands are powerful, as they were designed to be within vanilla (see the OP's creation). Commands are vanilla because they come with the game. If they did not come with the game, you would need to **modify** the game to get commands (such as the [WorldEdit](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/worldedit/) mod, which mods the game to add new commands since the *vanilla* commands are not good for mass building).\n\nCan you provide a correlation between \"third-party modification\" and \"command that comes with the game\"? If there is none, then how would you separate third-party mods from your definition of mods, since they conflict (features that come with the game vs. features that does not come with the game)? Do you have separate terminology for features that do not come with the game (a reminder that vanilla commands come with the game)? For example, how would you explain to somebody that the `/execute` command comes with the game while the WorldEdit mod does not without confusing that person using \"mod\" or \"non-vanilla\" to describe them both?", "id": "czri7l1"}, {"comment": "Yes it would be vanilla, by definition.

Blocks are only updated for lighting when the amount of light on them changes. Minecraft's lighting engine was not designed to handle the constant updates required for moving light sources. If dynamic lights worked exactly the same way as these normal lights, it would lag out the game. \n\nIn comes Optifine. Optifine only makes changes to the way the game is rendered on screen. Recently they added a feature to the light rendering system so that blocks which contain held or dropped torches render as if they were light emitting. That way, when the program decides the effects of light, it  doesn't have to consider where the dropped or held torches are. It's only the part of the code that renders light on the screen that needs to worry about that.\n\nThe downside of course is that dynamic lights do not behave the same way as light emitting blocks. This can confuse players, who of course expect dropped torches to behave the same way as placed ones. There shouldn't really be two kinds of identical looking light. Luckily, it turns out that this doesn't actually matter as much as you might expect. Light pretty much just stops mobs from spawning, and players won't try preventing that spawning by lighting up large areas with temporary dropped torches. Dynamic lights only ever light up a small area around themselves, which wouldn't noticeably stop mobs from spawning anyway.\n\nThe major downsides come in with multiplayer. Because it's only a rendering effect, the data is never sent to other players either. Light is important in PVP especially, where any players with even a small visibility increase are unfairly advantaged. It proves to be something of a (comparatively ineffective) hack.\n\nTLDR: No, it is does not effect monster spawning. Think of it as a graphical overlay.

If it were up to me I'd make the minecarts like boats in that two entities can ride in it at once (so I could ride in my minecart furnace and fill it with coal as I travel if necessary). I'd combine it with a chunk loader so any minecart furnace loads the chunk it is in and the 8 around it. I'd make it so you could attach a hopper minecart and a chest minecart to a furnace minecart (in that order) and the items in the chest minecart would feed the furnace. And I'd make these carts attachable to one another. Some recipe with a hook and eye with string makes a minecart hookup. Click on one minecart and then the other and the two are connected. Like pistons I'd max out connectivity at twelve, I'd make the connection unbreakable (it all becomes one entity so all the carts have to go over the edge before all of it comes off the tracks) without a tool (maybe shears or pickaxe-ing the minecart breaks its connection to others) and I'd fucking fix the power from the engine so it actually can move that stuff without breaking all the time. \n\nThat said... yeah it's worthless.\n", "id": "dar3irc"}, {"comment": "When I was trying to use them for long distance transport, pushing a few minecarts, I found that the direction would inevitably get reversed when things ended up on a diagonal...or something.

Yes there is an element of randomness to them but in many ways a player's \"character\" is more customizeable with enchants, for example a combat focused player gets enchants like Smite, Sharpness, etc. or a player drops an invisibility potion gets a \"stealth\" perk. ", "id": "d10rdu9"}, {"comment": "I kinda disagree in that assessment for the following reasons:\n\n1. Other games have perk systems and potions and enchants.\n2. There really are no choices between enchants to be honest -- no trade offs, really. Sure, you have to choose between Silk Touch or Fortune III on that pickaxe.  But you can have more than one pickaxe so there really is no limit except time invested.\n3. Potions are momentary perks. I use them all the time as I make them in huge batches. Perks would be permanent so long as you maintained level (in my example).\n4. Perks would be a permanent part of the player that does not depend on the items being worn.\n\nPerk systems can work in a number of different ways. Some perk systems require decisions that disable other decisions. You can specialize in Mining but not Fighting for example. Even small, seemingly insignificant perks can still add fun to the game. Slight speed increases, slight increase to health regen, etc. Make an uber perk like +1 to looting (effectively Looting 4 if you have the enchant too) at level 40 or 50 such that it hurts when lost and repairing an item may cause you to lose your perk. Just a bunch of random thoughts. I think the game would need more mobs before a perk system could ever be worth while.

Couldn't the same thing be done, say for an rpg with a perk system? You could make another character and choose some other perk for it .

Lots of ways to implement a perk system and I fundamentally disagree that the existing Enchanting and Potion systems completely devalue the concept as something that is entirely overlapping.\n\nAs for the three options for an enchant - eventually, if you do it right, you have one of each item that is maxed out on enchants. My strategy for enchants is to only go for the level 30 enchant if it is really worth while... combining Looting 1 swords until you have two Looting II swords, and then combining those two so that you get Looting III is really quite a trivial task compared to resetting the enchanting table until u get a Looting III in the level 30 slot, then leveling to 30 to get it (which is a lot of XP unless you come up with an XP farm and trivialize it).

(Many other comics can convey this just fine without a HUD.) However, it can be tricky so for that in particular, I understand.  The crafting table and  inventory makes the least sense though. The crafting table block even has a grid right on it which is obviously what you're supposed to \"interact\" with. As for the hotbar, I'm pretty sure that's supposed to be a belt or pockets. \n\nNot saying this interpretation is *wrong*, but it is cluttered and makes very little sense when you consider what these interfaces are actually presenting. \n\nAnyway, please don't take this as complete negativity.

I mean the rise of Dragon and Ender's own rise was greatly cut but was still shown. Also the second half wasn't as indepth and intense as the book but overall I'd rank it in my \"Movies I'll be rewatching for all time\" list.

For those perusing, don't read it unless you've read the books I cbf spoiler tagging the whole thing.\n\nI guess the ending is more Speaker for the Dead territory which is a great book but an incredibly slow read unlike Enders Game and if they wanted it to have success with the masses that wouldn't work well. Also without much of the narrative of the books and the looks inside Ender's head and the much longer time on Mars in the books and how much more intense Mars was. In the movie we only see the battles and a brief time with Mazer instead of the long 1 on 1 training interspersed by occasional battles which is what sets up Ender to become who he is in Speaker of the Dead. He becomes Andrew instead of Ender. If they went on to make a Speaker for the Dead movie (which oh my god I hope they don't that book would completely lose its tone if it was a movie it'd end up a survival thriller or something) then that scene would be in it but when you're presenting the masses-friendly Ender-only part of the character it would only be confusing to have that ending in it. Given that they don't do an alternate ending and instead show Ender going to Earth to be a hero or something, I'll gladly take it. Yes there wasn't the deal with Jane, the Ansible and The Game leading him to the Egg but instead him guessing where it is takes off a chunk of time on what was no doubt an already rather long movie in order to fit in the 3 stages of Ender (School which was lacking, Battle School and The Battles) and it still shows that he leaves and tries to undo his wrongs, it has the same tones.\n\nIts not a perfect match for the book but I'll take 3/5 over something like Starship Troopers (Loved the book, love the movie, can't realize that they're supposedly the same thing without becoming physically ill) or The Hobbit. I mean sure it wasn't perfect but they included so many things that most big holywood types would drop to make it simple; the lake, the game, the split personality. At the cost of reduced time spent on each component of the story as a penalty of the movie medium? Sure. But people made out like it was Eragon or something when it really wasn't that bad.\n\nAnd at the end of the day if it got a bunch of kids to watch a really cool movie and pick up some mind blowing scifi and think just a little bit differently about the world like OSC's work gets you to, then I think we can't discourage people from watching it.\n\nExcept maybe out of some kind of book elitism of which I am normally a huge proponent but man I found out about OSC's work by talking to a guy on AIM who I knew from a forum about a fantasy book that I picked up randomly in a book shop in Singapore because I was bored whilst waiting for family who was about a decade older than me so those books aren't as well known as maybe they should be and the movie helped with that.\n\nAlso excuse the long and no doubt frequently repeating and meandering and repeating post, its 8 AM and I've not been to sleep in a while.\n\nAlso more importantly I realized its been far too long since I re-read Ender's Game and I never got around to actually finishing the Enderverse so thank you /u/DVDJunky for giving you son an awesome name and thank you /u/Equeon for making me think about it enough that I realized I should re-read it.\n\nP.S. I totally agree that the book should be read first, the movie would seem so much flatter and hollower without the astounding depth of the book. But the book should **ALWAYS** be read first.", "id": "daea3nt"}, {"comment": "Eh, Speaker for the Dead was a fairly long book compared to Ender's game, but it could definitely be made into a proper movie format with a few choice cuts and snippings.

You won't need to dig strait down, as you can just alternate sides. While going down place ladders on one side and torches on the other so you have a way back up that is lit.\n\nOnce at the proper lvl clear out a small space for some basic things such as a chest, workbench, furnace, etc.\n\nNow for the mining. Dig a strait 2x1 shaft (just big enough to walk through) down about 30 or so meters.\n\nThen, every 4th block (so OWWWO, where W is wall and O is where you mine) of the shaft you dug dig strait until you hit something impassable such as lava or a large cavern. Keep shafts lit enough to see by\n\nOnce you reach end, go back to beginning, picking up torches and gathering ore you missed. block off shaft with door or cobble so you know you went down that shaft.\n\nRepeat. If you hit lava don't panic, it flows slow enough to put block down to block it or just walk away. If you complete the main shaft, just make it longer.\n\nThis works well because the shafts are small enough mobs don't really spawn, so its safe. But more importantly, you cover a lot of ground efficiently.\n\nThere is no need to mine everything as the only way you would miss an ore vien is if it spawned vertically in that area between shafts, which rarely happens.\n\nDoing this gets me about 7 - 8 or so diamonds per diamond pick. Its possible to have full diamond armor after 5 hours, versus not having diamonds  at all.\n\nYou don't even need to keep making torches, as you salvage the ones you put down. And you get plenty of coal/iron/redstone too.", "id": "d77e7kn"}, {"comment": "Solid advice for new players! Spending several hours mining in the earliest stages of the game gets you set up nicely. \n\nTo add: You need a lot of food while mining, so stock up. Hopefully you can find some cows, because in addition to meat, you'll want a piece of leather. Also, you'll want to find sugar cane to craft into paper. Add the leather to the paper to make a book. \n\nAs soon as you find 3 diamonds, make a diamond pickaxe, then find and harvest 4 Obsidian. Find 2 more diamonds, combine them with the obsidian and the book to make an enchanting table.\n\nEnchant your diamond pickaxe with a level 30 enchant. With any luck you'll get some level of Fortune, which will increase yields of diamond, redstone, lapis, & coal.\n\nThe only thing I disagree with would be picking up your torches. I leave them in place to prevent mob spawns. \n", "id": "d77g91c"}, {"comment": "Good point with the food and enchanting. Regarding the torches its personal preference. \n\nI typically pick them up as the shaft will be blocked off anyways so mobs won't get out (unless you mined enough getting a vein to go to where another shaft will be, but that is easy enough to fix) and it saves me from having to make more.", "id": "d77gujb"}, {"comment": "If your doing your mining in a far away place or are never going to make passive mob farms that fine, but if your are going to make a passive mob farm it's best to light all caves or tunnels up for better drop rates.", "id": "d77m9lg"}, {"comment": "It's more efficient going OWWO.

Since the \"face\" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the \"face\" (this guy (\u30c4) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first \"\\\\_\" is just saying \"hey, I don't want to italicize (\u30c4)\" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written \u00af\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\\\\\_/\u00af but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.", "id": "da5qowb"}, {"comment": "I'm in the same boat ^^^^pun ^^^^intended here.
