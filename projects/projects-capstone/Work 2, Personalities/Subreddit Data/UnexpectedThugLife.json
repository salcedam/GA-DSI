People expect tons of their lottery sales to go towards education, which in most states is just not the case.

Kinda grim, and really shitty. However, if you clicked on the links above, you'll notice that the 5 year survival for someone with Hodgkins Lymphoma is 65%. Much, much higher, right?\n\nI'm not trying to diminish or minimize her condition by any means. Of course I feel horrible for any person and their family that has to go through any type of cancer. However, it's kinda become a scare tactic to throw out staging in such a cavalier manner, because the lay person isn't going to know what that means. Hell, depending on how specific your cancer is, any doctor other than an oncologist might not know right off the bat what it means.

For example, a lot of local music venues will consistently pay ASCAP and BMI (two companies that collect and distribute licensing fees to singers and songwriters) so that people can play covers of songs in their venues. The fees are affordable and allows them to do public performances of copyrighted works.\n\nI used to do covers of songs on YouTube and YouTube has an algorithm that can detect if you're using copyrighted material pretty well, and then gives you the option to keep it up and just send the ad revenue to the publisher.\n\nDepending on the venue, a cover band could do a set and just hope that they don't get caught. Without paying the licensing fees, however, they'd still be subject to liability if a lawsuit was brought against them.\n\nThe reasoning makes sense. We want to incentivize people to create things. Maybe there's a great songwriter out there who doesn't have the best skill to perform his own works, and instead writes great music for other people who are actually good at performing. If we let anyone perform the stuff he writes without him getting any credit for it, he doesn't have much incentive to write.

The way you used that word doesn't follow it's meaning, and I'm sure you're aware of that too.

As in, there's no real reason to think that inappropriate sexual jokes to women translates to food safety. I mean, you mention maturity, but I'm not sure that holds water--people can act different ways in different situations. I mean, you even bring it up yourself: the comment \"the truth is often unkind, I know\" is practically a trope for a comeback used by teenaged girls in popular media.

I turned it into a noun so that it would fit with sentence structure. \n\nWhen I used one, I meant \"someone,\" not me, personally, which is why I said that I think that's not a representation of your actual maturity. \n\nI'm not sure what you mean to say with the pig comparison.

There's a reason train crews wear hearing protection. \n(It could damage the hearing of the two guys in the car as well, but they made that choice.)\n\n2) This probably doesn't apply to the woman at the window, but to the employees behind her. If you startle someone who's cooking or working with food, you could cause them to burn or hurt themself. \nRemember the elderly woman who spent a week in the emergency room, had skin grafts and a year of medical care (search for those pictures online) because of burns from spilling McDonalds coffee? And it turned out lots of people including tiny children and babies have suffered similar injuries both at McDonalds and elsewhere? People say \"They shouldn't have spilt coffee on themselves). Well a train horn is a goid way to make people drop spill things. Coffee, babies, whatever.\n\nSpeaking of property damage, people in the restaurant can easily break their phones or whatever by dropping them. Hopefully no one dropped any babies.\n\n 3) There could be additional harm from medical things which these guys don't know about.

They were risking actually physically harming someone.

He wants to institute torture beyond anything the country has ever seen. You're ridiculous if you think he's presented a consistently libertarian policies with fiscal responsibility.

Anything to the left of \"I hate black people\" is a-ok and easily dismissed? You are setting up a cartoonishly simplistic threshold of explicitly racism that even George Wallace and Bull Connor didn't pass.\n\nTrump said that a mexican judge was unfit to preside over his case. Simply because he was mexican. That's explicit racism. \n\nTrump used to literally identify and block black people from living in his buildings.\n\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/15/doj-trump-s-early-businesses-blocked-blacks.html\n\nhttp://www.dailywire.com/news/3751/trump-allegedly-discriminated-against-blacks-hank-berrien\n\nHis casinos used to discriminate black workers. He is on record according to high ranking executives who worked with him saying explicitly racist things:\n\n\"And isn't it funny. I've got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. . . . I think the guy is lazy.

Because you have already went from an \"innocent question\" to straight up talking points and apologetics.\n\n> Unless we're talking about the right to bear arms, but for some reason that one doesn't count.\n\nThat's boilerplate republicanism, and really has very little to do with libertarianism. You can count it, but it doesn't erase the fascism.\n\n> Securing your borders is not an authoritarian principle.\n\nActually it is. Double for profiling, breaking up innocent families, and rounding people up in a massive deportation process. Do you have any idea what a 12million person deportation looks like? Think of cattle trains. Do you have any idea what spying on every Mosque, and banning Muslim immigrants looks like? Think police state.\n\n> How he runs his privately-funded and operated campaign has nothing to do with Constitutional liberties.\n\nAuthoritarianism can come from the private power. The definition of fascism includes a merger of corporations and state. He believes in top-down power, with himself holding as much as he can possibly get, with zero regard to YOUR liberty if you ever cross him.\n\n> I'd like to know when this happened, but given what I've seen to be your definition of \"explicit\", I'm guessing this probably means \"a vague assertion that I interpreted as a call for violence.\"\n\nAre you fucking kidding? Why are you even debating people on reddit when you haven't been paying any attention?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIs2L2nUL-0\n\nThat is explicit. He specifically called for violence, glorified violence, condoned violence, and said he would defend the violence in court. It's indisputable and if you try to deny this, you're denying basic english.\n\n> Did he say something mean and hurt somebody's feelings?\n\nIs that how you characterize basic bigotry? Man, you sure backtracked on your first post fast. You should practice sticking to your little game where you pretend to not be a bigot for longer than 2 minutes.\n\n> I'll give you that his narcissism is over the top sometimes, but I'd argue that the alternative is just getting another narcissist in office who's more sly and less honest about it. If we're looking within the scope of the top two candidates right now, then I'd agree with him that \"only he\" could fix a lot of these things.\n\nThat shows a gigantic deference to authority on your part. You are literally the opposite of a libertarian, which goes along perfectly with my original thesis. You trust authority blindly if you view them as on your team.

This moral person would expect a profitable business to pay their workers increased wages. Reality says this is not the case.\n\nIf you are a hardcore capitalist, then there is one other principle to recognise, and that is, businesses must be able to fail, and new ones must be able to rise. If we treat businesses like a sponge, wages and costs are how a business slowly gets wringed out. A well run business will comfortably outpace the money it loses and find a balance in the economy. A poorly run business will get wringed out through costs and wages quickly. If we do not let businesses fail, the economy doesn't evolve. Right now banks are approaching wealth levels which force us not to allow them to fail. And bad business like Walmart could run at a loss for a hundred years. To put it simply, if business is not in a balanced state, where it is always possible to lose if you don't innovate or run properly, they won't die, and they won't let new, better business take their place.", "id": "d0ow39d"}, {"comment": "Um, are you advocating that we allow banks to fail?

What they can do now is hold the economy hostage because if they fail, we get a depression. They can ask for any amount of money and we'll have to pay it.\n\nIf you didn't know it yet, banks do many different things with money. They invest in stock markets, loan mortgage money, small loans, community investment, etc. For all of these services banks collect a fee. A badly run bank should fail if they can't stay afloat on these fees. FDIC insurance covers the first $250,000 in case of failure. This was originally put in place to keep bank customers from panicking in bad times and withdrawing all of their money *because banks could fail.*\n\nNow so much of our economy is wrapped up in the way these banks are run that if they fail, the economy goes with it. Sanders wants to break up the banks for this reason. Because banks should be able to fail as businesses, they should have to compete, and compete fairly, not only against the market but against the economic environment. \n\nThey shouldn't be allowed to gamble with depositor money, or sell loan packages they know are bad, or later bet on the packages they just sold as good products, failing.\n\nNo *good* capitalist wants banks to be out of reach of failure.", "id": "d0owo9t"}, {"comment": "not sure why you were downvoted. it bums me out that people cant have differing opinions and still be respectful.

He was on the right side, but lacked the traditional virtuous heroic traits. The original True Grit (1969) was pretty controversial for it's time for it's... grittiness and anti-heroic traits of his character. I'd say the original True Grit is pretty mild for today, while The Searchers leaves you reeling a bit with his actions.\n\nI'm not sure if he did more like that, those are the only ones I've seen, but this sort of thing is pretty typical of some of his roles.
